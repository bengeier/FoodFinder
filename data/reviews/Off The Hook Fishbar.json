{"text":"Food was okay - as others have pointed out, a bit expensive. Everything is fried fresh, right when you order. Nothing is frozen (better not be for the price you're paying).  We had the calamari and two orders of halibut with fries. It took a very long time for food to arrive, as it was quite busy on a Saturday evening.  Big points lost for service - Also as others have mentioned, the staff here aren't exactly welcoming and warm.  I wasn't pleased at how they were treating their customers. I'm not expecting a joint like this to roll out the red carpet, but I do expect a bit of kindness."}
{"text":"You can get gluten free fish AND onion rings!! So amazing! The dips are great...Chipotle mayo a bit spicy, mango salsa totally yummy...if you're not starving get the 3 fish in a basket...really, it's all great!"}
{"text":"I had a small craving for some fish & chips, but I was a good distance from my favorite place, and I had passed but this place a few times before and decided to give it a try. This restaurant presents well, both from the outside and inside, with a more broad assortment of different kinds of fish on offer than the typical halibut and haddock most fish & chip places have on offer.  I ordered the halibut and chips and must say I was disappointed with my meal. I found the portion I received to be small and the worse part was the batter, too tough, too doughy and not tasty. To me the guilty pleasure of eating fish & chips is the batter, you know it is just jammed with hight fat calories, but when done right, it just too crispy and tasty  to do with, what I sometimes do with fried chicken sometimes coating, strip off the coating and just eat the chicken when the coating is blah.  The fries I found to be overdone, which is not a huge problem for me, as I like my fries more toward the well done side, but the problem was although they had just come out of the fryer, I found them to be kind of soft and not crisp, how I like my fries. The creamy coleslaw I found very un-creamy and not very tasty, the one real positive I can say is although the fish portion was small, to my liking, it was of a good quality and deserved a much better batter than they are serving it in."}
{"text":"Ok.  I want to give this place a three, but I will give it a four because it has been so long since I could walk into a place and order fish and chips - oh, I mean ONION RINGS! that were safe, delicious and not made in my own kitchen.  We walked in and were greeted right away even though the place was packed and just cranked.  the service was awesome.  I asked a lot of questions about the Gluten Free-ness of everything.  I was being a bit picky.  They were so kind and patient.   The batter is made with chickpeas, my gluten free, corn free and grain-ish free friends.  Awesome news!!! (dear off the hook ppl, if you have time to read yelp, thank you thank you thank you for using chickpea)   I could go on a rant here that it should be rice because that fries so nicely....alas.   Chickpea is much bettta.  I got the GF halibut and Onion Rings.  My partner got gluten-filled halibut and fries.  We tried both coleslaws as well as the Garlic dip and the original tartar.   When I go in again, I will ask for everything well done.  I think the rings needs a bit more time - but I get when you are slammed...you do it well, just not always best.   I will definitely go back to this little shop - just not too soon.   The deepfried-ness is not always the best life choice.  Can't wait to keep this little one in my pocket for a day when I need to feel awesome.  Thanks for the delicious GF food!   I like the diner feel to the space - again, people if you want a chic place, don't be trying an old diner space.   wow.   Note: they have two gluten free beers - sooo awesome!  loads of other items are GF as well.   Just ask questions, they seem used to it.  mmmmm......."}
{"text":"Food is great, if you can get it.  Every time we have called for take out, we are immediately placed on hold (which isn't hold since you can listen the the cook's conversations in the kitchen) and never picked up. So disappointing that this rudeness has occurred on multiple occasions."}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTED!!! Ordered food on a Friday night, place was pretty much filled with tables.  There was a line to order food.  Went there for takeout and by the time I ordered my food and waited, it was over 1 hour!!! No exaggeration.  There were so many tables that were starring at the cooks at the front to see if they had put out any orders.  Everyone else waiting for takeout was also waiting just as long to get their food.  If you left the restaurant and paid, and wanted to come back in to check in on your take out order, the food was given away to someone else.  People even grocery shopped and came back and their food wasn't done yet.  Attitude of staff did not seem to care about how long people were all waiting for their food, rather just saying that sometimes that just how things go.  Clearly they need to be more efficient in running the ktichen area.  The person handling the cash should also not help out with tables but also help with the kitchen preparing trays, coleslaw, so on.  To save time, they should have some coleslaw and sauces packaged ahead of time and store it in a fridge so that way you don't have two people struggling to make food and put everything together."}
{"text":"Came here to check it out. We bough 2 Fish and chip dinners which came to about $28. We took it to go and when finally broke in to the box it looked like no much. The fish was delicious, but it was lacking in chips. The price seemed a bit excessive considering if you put both of our meals together it only looked like one.  That being said, I would still go back. some of the food on the menu look to good to pass up."}
{"text":"I've been to Off The Hook so many times and I'm never disappointed. Not even once ! I've tried many of the different fish options, with all the different batters, seasonings and dips. These dudes know how to make some good fish. Last I went in I got the burger... PURE HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH ! If you're not feeling like fish, you should definitely try it. Oh and their Poutines..... No buddy can say no to that level of deliciousness NO BODY. Hidden gem of Toronto"}
{"text":"Best poutine in the city-hands down. Although I find the gravy has up and down days-best gravy in the city."}
{"text":"Awesome! Good food, good beer, good service! And such a change to be offered gluten free so easily!"}
{"text":"Was really good. Big piece of what looked like a full fish. My grandmother approved and she's hard to please. 80 years of fish and chip experience. Really expensive though. Guy who served us was friendly."}
{"text":"We have had the good fortune of checking out this shop many times. We love that they have gluten-free options available, both for the batter and drinks. The variety of batters and dipping sauces is a nice touch as is the fish selection. I recommend this shop to anyone who listens!"}
{"text":"I passed by this place numerous times, and always noted how busy it looked. I went on a Saturday night for an early dinner (around 6) and was able to grab the last table. Their take-out line was quite busy as well.  I ordered the sea bass with organic house batter, along with \"Off the Sauce\" garlic sauce, onion rings and coleslaw with vinagrette. Others in my party had the original tartar sauce, cajun sauce (not very spicy), regular fries and poutine. I felt that all of the available sides made the meal a great value. My sea bass with \"Off the Sauce\" was delicious! For fish and chips being all battered and fried, the meal was surprisingly ungreasy. I would recommend the sea bass with the creamy coleslaw. I'm not sure if I like the fries, onion rings or poutine -- they are a bit of an afterthought for me.  The food came out quite slowly, but it was worth the wait. Just don't expect to dine quickly if you're stopping in for a bite!  No complaints about the service; decor was a bit lacking, but fine for a neighbourhood joint.  I'll be happy to return to try out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"My boyfriend found this fish and chip place because I was craving for fish and chip but didn't want to go to our usual place.  We wanted to check out what other restaurant has to offer.  Live life a little bit is what I believe in.  Well, he surprised me with Off The Hook Gourmet one afternoon during a weekday.  The restaurant was small, dimly lighted, clean looking,  the wait wasn't as long because we got there before 6pm.  The host/server was very friendly and the wait for the food wasn't long.  They have a nice selection of fish (cod, halibut and mahi-mahi) and sides (sweet potato, reg fries...a very long list) and creamy or apple cider cole slaw, you can choose from.  The options were really great.  We ordered the jerk halibut and cajun mahi-mahi fish with sweet potato and cajun fries.  However, the fish and chips were really well done.  Too well done for my taste but we finished our food.  Same with my boyfriend.  The cole slaw was good. We had the apple cider vinaigrette cole slaw.  The service was really great.  I would recommend giving Off The Hook a try, maybe ask if they not make the fish and chips too well done:)"}
{"text":"Staff are really great at explaining your options. Service is friendly and fast. Food is scrumptious. Lots of choices on the menu. I had the Cajun batter - just the right amount of heat. I can never finish everything on my plate. Bonus: a pint of draught is often only $5.00. Double bonus: peanut free!!!"}
{"text":"This shop has a wonderful selection, including spiced batters and even gluten free! I came on a recommendation of one of the best onion rings around, and I would say there were quite good - they use the same batter as the fish, so they are really fluffy and crispy compared to regular rings.  I tried the standard batter and fish since it was my first time, and my boyfriend tried the mahi mahi. Both were yummy. Next time I think I will go for a spiced batter to kick it up a notch!"}
{"text":"I've had the opportunity to try different Fish N Chip joints, and I would say here is a bit above average. They have a decent menu list of items from fish, crab cake, sandwich, poutine etc.,  Its close by Broadview Station so that was a big plus. We had the Groupon for four special $20 for $40. I got the Halibut cajun style w/ fries and choice of sauce which was jalapeno ranch (nice twist from tartar). Choice of coleslaw from creamy to vinegrette. I got the creamy, but it didn't taste that good. The fish is good size and taste fresh for certain. The fries remind me of downtown Queen fries cart shop.   My gf got the Red Snapper with the same sauce and fries. My bro's gf got the same except with Giant Onion Rings which were very batterly and oily. My bro got the crab cake and duck confit poutine which is better than a normal poutine I'd say.  The crab cake was about 4 oz pressed like a burger patty, and the texture is crispy. Didn't really get a nice taste of crab like other places I have gone to. The duck confit poutine is def tastier than just a regular poutine because of the brie cheese they use instead of mozza.  Overall I actually give this place 3.5 star out of 5. The decor style makes me feel depressed, and the tables are small and congested. The food is fine, but nothing 'off the hook' about where I'd go gaga for.   FYI: The Boylan soda drinks are worth trying, such as, the vanilla flavoured one!"}
{"text":"I can only say one bad thing about the place, so lets get that out of the way before the gush fest happens.  the night i was there was a little chilly, and the door was open.   NOW, very rarely has a name said so much, as this place is really Off the hook, in that nineties hip hop sort of way. being a former west coaster, then an east coaster, and dating a catholic teacher, fish on Fridays still resonates for me, and it tends to be a delight of mine to have it deep fried. Off the hook does everything right, and then some.   It's sort of like a choose your own deep sea adventure - They have a bevy of options for fish, haddock, bass, halibut, swordfish, cod, and snapper the day I was there.  - Then, they have a bunch of batters to choose from, one being a gluten free batter, and a couple other tasty surprises. - THEN, three or four fries options, spicey and sweet available, as well as onion rings or poutine.  - the best part is this. the dips. i think there were 10 different sauces to choose from, and the ones i had were sublime  the fish here is obviously very fresh, and super crisp and very very good. the fries were perfect and seasoned well, and the curry sauce i had was soo tasty, i licked the ramekin after. i did. no shame.   Pair this with cheap mill street on draft, and you just made this boy very happy. plus, it came out fast, and didn't break the bank.  and the best part was, i didnt have that \" i just gorged myself on deep fried fish and beer\" feeling in my stomach\" afterwards, even though I just did!!  looking forward to this friday, as i will be there."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in the area. They always run specials throughout the week. Their fish and chips are always delicious and having the ability to customize everything right down to the type of batter they use is an amazing feature. Their fish tacos are the best - huge portions of fish in each taco.  On Sundays they have buck-a-shuck oysters and 1/2 price bottles of wine, great way to wind down the weekend. Great rotating craft beer selection and local wines."}
{"text":"I've been here many times over the years and my opinion just gets better! The food is so good, I swear their coleslaw should be called crack-slaw!!! Also, they do buck a shuck on Sundays. Their tacos are just amazing (fried shrimp big standout!!). We will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal! Wife and I both had fish and chips (she had Halibut & Onion Rings, I had Seabass & Fries).  Both were prepared very well - perfect batter, light, flaky, not extra greasy!  The onion rings were also superb, possibly the best I've ever had.  The fries were good too (NOTHING wrong with them), but they couldn't compete with the onion rings.   I'm guessing anything they deep fry turns out awesome.  Also, I strongly recommend the garlic based sauce (instead of standard tartar sauce).  It was addictively tasty.   Very impressive selection/options on their menu.  To be clear, their menu basically has fish sandwiches, poutine, fish & chips, and a few other things, but the sheer volume of choices in customizing these options (type of fish, type of fries, type of sauce, etc).  Makes me want to keep coming back to try all the variations. Also a very impressive list of Gluten free menu options (and beer options!), if you're into that sort of thing. Prices were very reasonable, most expensive dish I saw was $14."}
{"text":"Having celiac disease, it is challenging to find gluten free options that are still safe for me to eat.  Randomly checked this place out on recommendation from my \"Find me-gluten free\" app and was blown away. They have a dedicated gluten free fryer and all items, from fish to fries, onion rings and deep fried chocolate bars (they specify which are celiac safe) are available gluten free. I live down the street from Harbord fish and chips and even if i could still eat there, I'd choose to drive out to off the hook instead."}
{"text":"I was here on Monday for dinner and it was amazing! I got the gluten free halibut and the batter was perfect--crispy, just a tad greasy, with an amazing flavour.   I also appreciated their dedicated gluten-free fryer, and their half onion ring/half chip side dish. Brilliant. I'll be back this weekend for more."}
{"text":"I was very happy to come back for the second time after a year. But my second experience was not as good as the first.  I went this past weekend and thought of enjoying their food as I did the first time, however I was very disappointed. I ordered fish and chips and it was dry and over cooked...don't know how you can mess that up. Also my sweet potato fries were made in old oil so it tasted pretty bad. Their tacos should have two taco shells as it becomes soft and falls apart before picking it up from the centre.  Service was slow even with four people in the restaurant and there was only two tables with customers. The owner was attending to close friends of his and we saw one of the workers on his phone instead of clearing our table. It was funny because he walked away when he was caught by us looking at him. Food was not impressive this time and neither was service. Only reason I'd go back would be for their deep fried mars bars."}
{"text":"Gluten free fish and chip heaven. Husband is a celiac. Tried the cod, the halibut and the trout. Ordered the fish tacos too. Way too much food!  I shouldn't order when I'm hungry. Everything was fresh, crispy and delicious. The onion rings were the most surprising. Will come as often as our waistlines allow!"}
{"text":"Off the hook should be off the streets!  This was my second time visiting this restaurant, I saw a deal on buytopia and figured why not since it was pretty decent the first time around.  I'm not sure what changed from my first visit, but it changed for the worse.    On to it then, I felt like the staff wasn't really in to running the restaurant, they didn't seem that friendly or attentive, I noticed the waiter losing interest and watching the tv at times while  my wife was talking to him about the menu and what was good on it.  I guess I could bear with the lack luster service as long as the food makes up for it, unfortunately the food is as bad as the service.  We got 2 combos of fish and chips, halibut with onion rings and sea bass with OTH poutine.  The batter on everything was too thick to my liking, the poutine which had sweet potato fries were mostly burnt, the fish felt overcooked and more on the rubbery side, for some reason the sea bass was sticking to my teeth when I chewed it.  Their garlic sauce (lost in sauce) was terrible, but I did enjoy their jalapeno ranch sauce.  We couldn't tolerate the garlic sauce, so we asked for a safer choice, tartar sauce and it ended up costing a buck for a small container of sauce!  I think that's a little ridiculous given that I've never been charged for extra tzatziki sauce at Greek restaurants   I did not enjoy my experience and will definitely not be returning nor recommending this to anyone."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to LOVE this place. We recently took a friend because we raved about it so much, however were very disappointed! They must have recently changed owners/managers because everything had become more dialed up in regards to their menus, plating etc. The food however is now less than impressive.   WHAT WE ORDERED: halibut (organic batter), cajun frings, tartar sauce and vinaigrette coleslaw.  Halibut: tender, flaky, smaller portions than we remember Cajun frings: might as well have not been cajun. The onion rings were deeply battered and tasted like dough, and both the fries and onion rings were cold and tasted a bit soggy.  Tartar and coleslaw: delicious however nothing too special about these here.   I was very disappointed having loved this place and since it's a nice local joint. May have to head over to Len Duckworth's now for some decent fish & chips!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now, and I walked out happy both times. First time was a couple of weeks ago, when I went in by myself, on a weekday at around 2.  I ordered the halibut and chips with the wasabi sauce and creamy coleslaw.  It arrived very quickly, and I was pleased with the result.  It was a long, single piece of fish, with a light, yet incredibly crispy batter.  The fish was meaty yet buttery, as good fresh halibut should be.  I would compare the fish to that of Old Yorke - not quite AS good, but damn close!  They have a great soft drink selection - many glass bottles.  The server/manager recommended that next time I try the crab cake sandwich.  The second time I came was on December 30th, at around 4pm with my wife.  We decided order two items and split them.  We got the aforementioned crab cake sandwich with onion rings.  Our server recommended that we have it with the chipotle mayo.  We also got the calamari with the wasabi sauce. The serving of calamari was gigantic.  DEFINITELY worth the $10 price-tag.  It was fresh, not too chewy and went very well with the wasabi sauce.  My only complaint is that it was a bit too salty - and I'm someone who likes salty food. The crab cake sandwich, though, was a bit of a disappointment.  I am a big fan of crab cakes, and I usually order them if I see them at a restaurant.  These ones tasted a bit funny.  The best way to describe it is that they tasted a bit... dirty.  Not that any of the ingredients were bad, but I feel like maybe there was too much Old Bay seasoning, or celery salt - something was a bit off with the seasoning.  It made it so I really couldn't taste the crab, which is what you're looking for in a crab cake.  I hope this isn't what it always tastes like, and they improve the flavorings.  Otherwise, the bread was very soft and tasty, and the toppings were fresh and crunchy.  The onion rings were beer battered - it looked almost like the fish batter, but was much softer.  They were made with red onions, which made them sweet, and each bite had just the right amount of onion in them.  So, other than a couple of seasoning issues I had, both meals were very good.  They were very busy on our second visit, which gives me hope that they'll be around for a while.  I look forward to many happy returns!"}
{"text":"Usually when I order fish and chips at a place I end up with something that is more batter (see: greasy, dark brown and crusty) than fish, and my stomach does somersaults within an hour.  Not so at Off the Hook. I was pleasantly surprised to get a nice piece of halibut that was light in colour, not hidden in a coating of greasy batter and didn't make my stomach flip afterwards.  The secret must be in the coating (including organic or gluten free flour) and whatever type of oil they use to cook their fish. It just tastes healthier than most places.  It was just one piece of halibut (with homemade tartar sauce) but it was more than enough alongside a portion of yam fries (with dipping sauce) and coleslaw, all for $13. That's a great price because most places charge $15-$17 per plate for substandard fish and chips.  The service was quick and friendly, there's a little bar in the back with a couple of brews on tap (on this night I chose Spearhead), and there's limited seating.  I was there on a Saturday night. All but one or two tables were full and quite a few people were coming in for take-away."}
{"text":"Excellent Poutine."}
{"text":"Really great place with a great selection of gluten-free options. Perfect portions, slaw, sides and super delicious home made signature sauces that separate OTH from other fish and chip joints. Worth every penny and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a weekend with high expectations.  Unfortunately, this place was a big disappointment.  The good:  -the quality of fish is decent - i like how you can watch the cook in the front of the restaurant (everything is in the open).  The bad: - When ordering the combo, you pick the following: type of fish, side (fries, onion rings, etc), type of coleslaw, type of sauce (lots of housemade options).  For all 4 of our orders, at least 1 thing was wrong. - batter on the onion rings was way too heavy (depends on your preference though). - the portion size was a joke, the cod I ordered was about 4 oz, it has a medium batter.  This place is a awful value.  I was still hungry after this.  They seemed to be pretty busy for a weekend lunch.  I recently saw a groupon (half price) deal for this place, so I'm sure they are about to experience a lot more traffic over the next few weeks.  At half price, its ok."}
{"text":"The Groupon coupon I bought awhile back for this place was a day away from expiring, so I decide to go down and check this place out, initial intention was to dine in, it was shortly after 6pm on a Friday and the place was packed, so take out instead.  We ordered the Sea bass ($14) and Halibut ($12) with chips, creamy cole slaw. The food was freshly prepared so there was a bit of a wait. After getting the food and another 15 minutes drive back home, we were impressed! The batter is still crispy and the fries was not soggy even after the short trip. The sea bass was a tad on the smaller side and tasted ok but the halibut was decent in size and tasty. Order an extra tartar sauce but was given a jalapeno ranch instead, surprise surprise, it was awesome, don't get me wrong the tartar sauce was legit but the ranch was the bomb. The creamy slaw was so so. Overall I really liked the meal we have and I vowed to go back another time.  Went back this past Friday around 2pm, the placed was empty, my plan worked as I was purposely trying to avoid the lunch crowd. Order the Haddock special ($9.95), this time the vinaigrette slaw, much better than the creamy variety. Skipped the tartar sauce and doubled up on the Jala-ranch. Everything was awesome, this time fresh off the frier.  The fish was flaky and moist, the batter stays with the fish. A crispy, golden brown blanket around the flesh, with a touch of the slightly smokey jala sauce, it was simply heaven. The chips was great as well, the slightly burnt skin added another layer of flavor (homage to  new york fries).    I am a die hard F&C fan, from Penrose, Olde Yorke, British Style, Buster Sea Cove at St Lawrence ( Their shoe sting fries simply annoys me), to the now closed Kat's. Off the hook as well as The one that got away made me equally happy. They both do Fish and Chips really well, but they managed to inject some new twists to the classic often describe as boring English comfort food. So the next time you fancy some fish and chip, give Off the Hook a try?"}
{"text":"I've been here at least on three occasions, a quick lunch, a nice dinner date and once when I just craved for the delicious Mahi mahi sandwich. The food is splendid and the details in the décor are nice. The service is wonderful, a little inconsistent though. I have had to wait a long while at a table once before anyone even came out from the back. The neighbouring table of 4 people got there before is and left disappointed without being served.   I was happy I waited though, food was great!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Perfectly crisp and seasoned fish & onion rings. Great clam chowder, yummy poutine & light, fresh, fish tacos."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's so hard to find gluten free food in restaurants that actually tastes good and theirs is very tasty.  The service is great too. Pretty sure this will become my husband and I's new go-to spot."}
{"text":"Walzt into the restaurant, greeted by Manager Chad - instant order; didn't have a plan: ask the Owner to make me a sandwich Steve knows my taste: Blam ten minutes later the sandwich hits me. Quick drive home open the bag and then Wham! Fresh Grilled Snapper Chipotle Mayo a wee bit of Jalapeno and just enough Creamy Coleslaw to make the sandwich sing. Oh my - it certainly was tasty! Thanks Steve."}
{"text":"Wow just wow. Have never had such fresh light fish and chips! We ordered the gluten free batter, it was so light and the Sea Bass and Halibut were delicious. The portions were large and the sweet potato fries were also light and crispy. The accompanying cole slaw was fresh and tasty and the choices of sauces was a bit overwhelming at first but we chose the yohgurt cliantro (tasted a bit like Tsadiki) and the mango salsa. The chipotle mayo also came with the fries. Our other side was a light freshly mixed Caesar Salad which hit the spot. We shared everything and were too full for dessert. Congrats to the owner who was personable and served us! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to this place because I had a voucher. I was really looking forward to trying this place since it seemed to get decent reviews. I ordered the halibut and chips with the creamy coleslaw and tartar sauce. The tartar sauce was nice and tangy, delicious! However the fish was just OK. The batter was kinda soggy and chewy. The fish was fresh, but it's a deal breaker if you can make a decent batter. I wouldn't go back here, there are better fish and chip places in the city."}
{"text":"As my friend and I had plans on seeing a concert just around the corner, I did a search on Yelp and found this place.  My friend had also been here before and she said it was good so that was an added bonus.  Place is very casual and staff are friendly.  I was expecting it to be busier seeing as it was a Friday night but there were just about a handful of people including my friend and I.  Because of the concert, we had almost left the place thinking that time would be too tight, however the waitress assured that we would get our food within minutes since everything was just fried anyway.    Both my friend and I ordered fish and chips, just two different types of fish and also two different types of coleslaw.  Halibut - I think the best way to describe it was that it was very \"meaty\".  The filet was about an inch thick and was nicely battered.  Batter was of perfect consistence without it being too greasy either.  5/5.  Mahi Mahi - First of all, to have Mahi Mahi as an option for a fish and chips joint is amazing so of course I had opted for this.  The portion however, was a little disappointing especially for its price.  However, aside from the portion, the fish was still nicely battered and fried.  Had a nice crisp and it also wasn't too greasy.  4.5/5 (lost that .5 rating due to its size).  Fries - Fresh cut fries that were amazing.  I'm always anxious to taste how the chips are that come with the fries and in my opinion they should always be fresh cut.  They are also pretty generous with the amount of fries, though, my friend with the larger filet got more fries.  So again, my meal portion was a little disappointing but I can also understand that may have just happened since they knew we were in a rush.  5/5.   I'm quite picky when it comes to fish and chips but I'd definitely come back here if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome place! A bit pricey at $18 for fish 'n chips, but the portions were big and the food tasted excellent. Plenty of selection in terms of fish, batters, sides, and dipping sauces. They even have gluten-free batter and onion rings. Customer service was great. The place is pretty small so reservations on the weekend might be a good idea."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night at 6pm thinking it was early enough that we might beat the rush and it was already packed, although most people actually seemed to be waiting for take-out.  Maybe something was going on with the kitchen that night, but people were waiting for over 10 minutes to get their orders and it definitely took us a while to get our food - we spent 1.5 hours there, which is pretty long for a one course fried meal.  The sea bass fish and chips was delicious, a big portion of fish with crispy light batter, not too greasy. I had the \"off the hook\" poutine on the side for an extra $2, which had gravy with chilis in it with brie cheese. Sounds weird but was actually tasty and had an interesting kick to it.  I got the homemade tartar on the side and it was really good, but I tasted my friend's garlic sauce and it was even better.  I really liked the fries: they were crunchy outside and soft inside. I didn't find the cajun fries particulary \"cajun\", it was just the regular fries with a bit of seasoning sprinkled on top.  Would definitely return, I think this is one of the better fish and chip places I've tried, I love how they have different fishes than the usual halibut and cod, and turning plain ol' chips into poutine just makes the whole meal better.  In terms of decor and service, the place doesn't have too much to offer, but for the food itself, it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"This is a cautionary tale for potential diners as well as the restaurant...  My grandfather lives right down the street from this place, and I went here for lunch on Monday (7/16/2012). I had the trout, a salad and creamy coleslaw. It was delicious and the service was good. This was the only thing I ate that day.  Then 2 hours later I started feeling really sick and threw up what was left in my stomach. From 5-9PM i was violently ill, i threw up non-stop and had to go to the emergency room. I was basically projectile vomiting every 15 minutes. I was in the ER all night, had chills, and was given 3 full bags of IV fluids along with 2 bag doses of Gravel and Reglan.   I was in and out of sleep and puking, and some of THE MOST INTENSE PAIN I have ever felt in my life, stabbing and grinding inside my innards. It was horrible.  It finally subsided at about 11PM and I awoke and felt much better. I was discharged sometime after midnight and have been fine since. I had HORRIBLE food poisoning for almost 7 hours.  I do believe that this restaurant gets great reviews, and their food was delicious. I don't think they're normally unclean or anything with their food, BUT it just takes ONE person who gets extremely ill from the food to break a restaurant and make them question their food preparation practices.  I never write reviews, but would never come back to this place and think people should be careful coming here."}
{"text":"Yeah!   Off the hook has been on our minds so my girlfriend and I decided to get some fish tonight - great decision!   I overheard from the - probably - owner that the fish is not greasy because they keep the frier at a bit higher than regular temperature. the batter is also gluten free. he also said that he uses a bit of soda when making the batter to avoid oily fish - high 5!   They rock. We had the duck confit poutine, yummy not heavy gravy and the duck was nice and crispy that created good texture balance with the fries. Mahi mahi with organic tartar sauce and some greens was a good choice too - again, not oily and nice white color inside, batter crisp like Chris Griffins bed sheet after a busy night.   Prices are ok, 8 bucks for the fish that comes with a side, $7 for glass of vino and $8 poutine. They also have fish sandwiches and other stuff.   staff looked a bit down when we got in, i guess they werent busy enough, they got some smiles on later on.   Overall they nailed it, great fish and chips!"}
{"text":"Tasty, but small portions of fish.  I tried Off the Hook as a result of a Groupon and had expected more.  The staff were really nice and accommodating, and they supplied a generous portion of fries, but it didn't make up for the lone (and rather small) portion of fish relative to the cost."}
{"text":"Buncha Dudes that know nothin 'bout fish passin off whatever they ca get away with off the locals. I'm an east coaster and I know a halibut from a a trout. I wAs plated out something they hoped would pass as cod that I can guarantee NEVER saw an ocean in its life. Fancy dressy SHAM! You want great Fish & Chips, go to High Street!"}
{"text":"This is heaven for those who cannot tolerate gluten. GF (gluten-free) selection of beer? GF deep fried munchies? You don't see that too often. I was hoping for more fish in the cajun batter though, but $12 for the Mahi Mahi with Canadian poutine is not overpriced.  For those who like some eye candy while they gobble on their prey, the staff looked like they were specially picked for their visual more than their skill."}
{"text":"Went for lunch during the week in the mid afternoon, place was pretty quiet. Had the mahi mahi battered reg. and the Mrs. Had it Cajun battered. Both were tasty. Service wa meh, hard to get their attention. Had to get up and grab things like extra napkins, but at least they were easy at hand.  Long story short, good food, meh service. Great beer list though, PS"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   We came here for lunch on a Sunday using an expired Groupon of which had a value of $19 (originally for 4 people for $40 promo value) but the details of the Groupon didn't mention that we needed 4 people to use the actual value. Anyways, even before we got there, we called to make sure we can use it and the staff on the line assured us it would be okay.   When we got there and proceeded to order, the same staff told us that we had to order 4 things in order for the groupon to work and that he had talked to the boss who confirmed this. Obviously we were very upset. He even told us to come back instead. I did not appreciate his lack of care and remarks. But we had traveled all this way so we decided to order 4 smaller menu items (he had told us only appetizers and entrees allowed).    So finally, we ordered four items: 2 crab cakes, the Boston Clam Chowder and Mahi Mahi Fish and Chips which comes with coleslaw. The soup came first and it was good. Not too salty and had a lot of clams in it. Very hearty and I would order this again if I ever go back.   The crab cakes did not look very appealing but it was surprisingly tasty. The portion of the cake was big so I couldn't finish mine and gave half to my boyfriend.   Finally the fish and chips was a generous portion and the batter was not too heavy. Of that dish though, the best part is probably the coleslaw (we got the creamy original one, it also comes in vinigrate). It tasted super fresh and not overly creamy, just perfectly balanced!  The decor itself is small, dark and pretty dingy so it would probably just be a good quick bite place.   Overall, the service was mediocre (we had to ask for water) but the food was tasty."}
{"text":"Oh man this place is bad. And I don't say that much. The food was literally cold, expensive , soggy and the fish tacos were so covered in some sort of dripping mayo I was gagging. Everything tastes fishy including the fries and onion rings. Pass on the Cajun seasoning, it's literally shaken on as an afterthought. They pride themselves on a lot of signature dipping sauces but the xxx spicy one I picked was ketchup with some sort of sambal oelek mixture. Soooo pedestrian. This should be a chip shop around a university, open til 4 and served to blind drunk people in a small town. it should also be half the price. Doesn't work."}
{"text":"Middle of the road, not bad fish but overly salty fries and gravy.  When ordering a pouting I was not able to finish it due to the abundance of salt.  I always recommend asking for the fries to come with no salt. The guys who work there seem nice and friendly.  I do have a F&C place I prefer, but this place is convenient when on the Danforth."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find!   This restaurant has a lot of character and personal laity.  Both times I went was during lunch and it wasn't that busy but bustling enough to create a wonderful ambience.   I love the customized approach to fish and chips that Off The Hook takes. I ordered the Rainbow trout with Cajun batter and Cajun fries and Jalapeño ranch dipping sauce and Vinegritte coleslaw.  When it finally arrived, it smelt like perfection and it was a concoction of perfectly blended spices, well cooked fish with a gorgeous crust that was just ridiculously delicious with a lovely crispy texture. The fries were mouth wateringly decadent and spicy as well. The dip was the cherry on top as it just accentuated the whole dish to a level of culinary grandeur and the coleslaw worked well to balance the spices with its sweet and mild flavors.   The only problem was the quantity as it was an ordeal to finish the massive portions served.   All in all it made for a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Great!  What else can I say? Service- Great, they explained everything about how to make your choice Food- Great, cooked to perfection Ambiance- Great, chill place"}
{"text":"Been many times and had excellent food and service but tonight the fish was beige and soggy (undercooked) we asked for our onion rings twice and we are yet to receive them. The attitude from the owner was confrontational and appalling which completely matched the quality of the food and service. Too bad that after only one year in business they have fallen so far. It is fair to say that we will never be back, too many other great places in this wonderful city."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Had the halibut here and it was so fresh and delicious. Also their coleslaw is pretttyyy amazing."}
{"text":"So this is my second time in a month or so that I've come in and had to send something back. Last time it was the fish and I commented on the change in the soup.  Today I had to send back the soup. Boston Clam Chowder is a basic cream based soup. What was served to me seemed off, way off. Then the server said they've been experimenting. I asked what was today's experiment?! The soup was spicy hot and possibly a use of curry?! He said he would out. I never got an answer.   Please for the love Jesus and all things sacred of food.. Don't mess with standard recipes!!!! Or don't call it something it's not.. Ie: Boston Clam Chowder."}
{"text":"I had to hit up this place after seeing all the rave reviews here, and I have to say, I wasn't disappointed.    I got a haddock sandwich which was amazzzing.  The amount of fish on this sandwich was unreal, it could barely fit on the bun!  This more than makes up for the slightly above average sandwich prices.  The fish was fresh and fried right then and there.  Paired with a chipotle mayo, lettuce and tomato, this was one of the best sandwiches I've had in a while.    Yum.  This all being said, I didn't have any fries and it's hard to really review a fish and chips restaurant without having the \"chips.\"  I'll have to revisit this review when I do, because I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here looking for deep fried Mars bar and I was not disappointed.  It was undiluted ooey gooey love.  Please if you find yourself with $3 dollars only in your wallet, come here and spend it on this lovely morsel.  It is worth it.  I had the halibut and chips and they were quite good as well.  But first love never dies right?"}
{"text":"My fave fish and chips in the city. Where else can you get this kind of variety--and yet not feel guilty about being responsible for all those cute yummy fish going extinct?  Viva socially responsible owners! They even have a gluten free batter option. Plus, they have a nice variety of draft and bottled beers, including a few local craft beers on tap.  Choose your fish, choose your breading, choose your sauce, choose your slaw, choose your brew."}
{"text":"My boyfriend really loves fish and chips, so I decided to bring him here for a date. He was really into the grungy, nautical meets rock and roll vibe of the place too. There are interesting vinyl covers all over wall, which I liked to ogle as well.  Since I'm more of a minimalist, I didn't love the decor. However, I liked the coziness of the restaurant, especially being seated at the back. The front reminds me too much of being at a greasy spoon, which I know some people don't mind and even like! To each her own.  Fast forward to the food! My BF really enjoyed the fish and chips made with the catch of the day: red snapper. He's really into dipping sauces (the boy will eat sauce on its own, he's kinda special that way), so of course he ordered two different sauces. I thought it was a nice touch to be able to customize your batter, sauce and type of coleslaw. The experience made me miss my fish eating days.   As the odd vegetarian out, I chose the vegan poutine and side arugula salad. The gravy is pretty yummy. I even had to make sure I got the vegan one. The cheese, however, is the dreaded Daiya. Since we've progressed into the world of fancy nut cheeses, nobody should have to eat Daiya, and wonder, \"Is this why the world looks down on vegans?\" Typically veggie of me, I loved my salad. It was well-balanced in flavour.  At the end of the meal, I had my reservations about Daiya and felt an unsolicited comment at the tip of my lips. When I suggested maybe it's not the best brand out there, the server informed me that all the gravy at Off the Hook is vegan. I could have chosen the real cheese curds all this time. I was a fool.  My BF so enjoyed his meal, especially the creamy coleslaw, that he asked to purchase more to go. The friendly server, who I highly suspect is not from Toronto, gave him a generous portion on the house. What a nice guy and great customer service! 10 points to Off the Hook.  Since I'm curious about the other vegetarian items like the breaded eggplant, I'm looking forward to the next visit! (Also, how great is it that a fish and chip shop has vegetarian items anyway?! The times are changing!)"}
{"text":"This place was alright. Convenient location, a few minutes walk from Broadview station. The setting and ambiance was really nice. However, the reason for the 3 stars was because of the service and food. Service was terrible, the server barely checked on us and we were really hungry. There weren't too many food options on the menu but I went with the Crab sandwich, with Cajun fries on the side. For what you pay, the burger size was pretty small, but the fries were good. The fish selection could have been better, as my friends who did order the fish and chips did not like it very much and found it too greasy. There are definitely better fish and chips places around. This was just alright."}
{"text":"Very good fish. The batter is reasonably light and not too greasy. The fish tacos are good, too. The chips (fries) are alright, and I like that for an extra buck you can get a mixed green salad instead of chips. Fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  I was excited to try this place out as their online menu identifies a number of gluten-free options and it did not disappoint. I got the gluten-free fish and chips with frings (also gluten-free) and creamy coleslaw (also gluten-free). The option of having all three of these items gluten-free made me happy to begin with, but when the food came I was just over the moon happy. The batter is real batter, not a thin coat of cornmeal like how other places make it. This is actual gluten-free batter that is deep fried and delicious. The onion rings (which I haven't been able to have in years) is also dipped in the same batter and is perfection. The fries are good but nothing special so I'd go will all onion rings.   Overall the food was great and the staff were friendly and attentive. I did not have any reactions to the food. This is definitely my go-to fish and chips place.   Note: I think they use a separate frying vat for their gluten-free food, but I'm not 100% sure so if you have ceiliac's disease (which I don't have) be sure to double check with them.   TL;DR gluten-free fish and chips uses real batter & it's delicious"}
{"text":"Off the hook, is completely off the chain!  Went with some coworker's here for lunch and we were all wowed.  I mean it's just fish and chips right?  The main reason we came here was because my colleague has a gluten allergy, and it's tough finding places for us to eat, and I recalled seeing Laura C's review and kept it in the back of my head.  You get the common selection of fish to choose from, Seabass, Mahi Mahi, Halibut, Snapper but what's uncommon is a choice of batter (house, glutten free, cajun) and style of cooking (grilled or deep fried).    We each chose one different set of fish and batter and sampled each others.  It was really perfect batter for all of them as it was very thinly coated, and to be honest, I've hated anything \"gluten free\" I've ever tried... except for this.  In fact I may even prefer the gluten free batter as it was even more crispy and very flavourful batter.  You also get a selection of dipping sauces.  I'm a fan of good 'ol tartar, but I got to sample the chipotle and garlic mayo which was fantabulous!  I'm not a slaw fan, but I finished every bite.  But what really set this place apart, was the Poutine.  I think I'm going to say that this is the BEST poutine you can get in the city.  Why?  They use duck fat to make the gravy and use brie (like OMG)!  Another friend of mine who's a Poutine connoisseur who even attended the Poutine fest in Ottawa the week prior to coming here, said this place is on par or better than the winner of the Ottawa fest.  We also shared the deep fried mars bar, but word of warning, the gluten-free batter with mars bar was a complete fail.  The batter really didn't adhere and was a bit of a mess.  It was close to taking away a star, but that's how good the fish and poutine really was.  Just through word of mouth, almost everyone from my office and their friends and family have been here now in just the last 3 weeks."}
{"text":"I won't be going back. The food was ok, but for the price, I expect much more. I realize we're talking about \"gourmet\" fish and chips here, but it is just fish and chips, right? I felt the staff were rude, impatient and spoke down to not only myself, but the rest of the people in the restaurant. This was my second trip to Off The Hook, figuring I would give them another try, that I had caught the staff on bad day the first time, but I was treated the same way again.   The fish is decent, but the sides were too small and the place is definitely over priced. As I said, I won't be going back"}
{"text":"Better than your average fish and chips shop.  The real winner is the coleslaw (available with vinaigrette or the traditional creamy-style).  The batter is extremely crisp but the fish is nothing special.  A plus that you can choose from 5+ types of batter.  The purist in me always opts for the traditional.  The thing that sets them apart is that they have gluten-free options.  I ate:  Sea Bass + Chips (though I splurged and subbed the fries with an OTH poutine of sweet potato fries, brie cheese and a spicy gravy). Sea bass may not have been the best idea in hindsight as the fish flake apart easily which made it hard for dipping.  Favourite Burger - topped with crispy bacon, onion, lettuce and tomato.  Good, but nothing spectacular.  The fries were double-fried, but too thick.  I don't know, maybe I came on an off night.  They didn't have any of their beers on tap, and they ran out of the Boston chowder.  Like I said, better than your average fish and chips shop, but nothing I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"This place is the reason I made a Yelp account. I'm tired of having my time wasted and my money taken for bad products and careless service. During the day when a female was doing the cooking,  the halibut was flaky,sweet, fresh and the batter crispy. I don't mind paying for something convenient that is at least as good as I can make at home. Don't bother with the burgers which taste strange with crumbly meat and I even had mould on a bun. Chicken fingers are dry with a poor breading to meat ratio; you could do better from a grocery store frozen food section. Salads, fries, rings are meh. So I only get 2 pieces of halibut (it's the same price whether you have fries or not), hoping it will be cooked and that I'll actually get halibut. One evening I ordered and received one piece of halibut and one piece of dense beige coloured oily fish; both had wet batter with a soggy outer layer. I decided to get the gluten free because the cashier claimed there is a fryer dedicated to gluten free; this way the odds of receiving someone else's fish that wasn't halibut were improved. It worked out well but I was the only customer in the place when I tried this. When my brother picked up the order, they had the wrong coleslaw in his order so always check before you leave if you get take out. Tonight I ordered the usual two pieces of halibut in gluten free batter to take home. When we opened it at home the meat was the dense oily beige fish which is not halibut and the batter was mostly wet and yellow against the fish (at least I knew it was the gluten free version); the outside was the same soggy mess. It smelled funny and was inedible so it went down the garbage chute. I live a 3 min. walk from the place and the times the fish was cooked well it was not soggy; halibut is white and flakey. I don't trust this place. I've given it  many chances. I phoned them tonight to tell them I will not be back. For those of you looking, Old Yorke has consistently excellent halibut; it's in another league from Off the Hook. The Globe Bistro across the street makes wonderful haddock; they will box it up nicely for you if you phone ahead and pick it up."}
{"text":"Gluten Free Fish and Chip Batter! That sold me.   For $12 you can get Halibut or Sea Bass ($10 for MahiMahi or Snapper),choose your batter (house, cajun, grilled, gluten free) comes with some tasty coleslaw, fries (Cajun, regular, onion rings, sweet potato fries, poutine) and a dipping sauce (tartar, chiptole mayo, creamy garlic etc). Psst, and for another $3 get a beer too!  Last night I got take out. I think they just opened.  At 8:30, I think they had a long day, so maybe chit chatting with the cook wasn't the best person to talk to. I asked the difference between Halibut and Sea Bass, and he said that the Halibut was flakier and there was a different taste. I got the sea bass in the Gluten Free Batter. I asked him what the batter ingredients were, and he had a hard time describing it to me, and someone piped up Rice Flour, which I was pleased with the answer.   They fry up the fish to the order which was nice, and about 7 mins later, I had a paper bag in my hands.   I took the box home in about a 15 min car ride. It's got to be one of the better fish and chips. The batter was not thick, not oily and it was crunchy.    The fries, however, was soggy and had barely a taste of the cajun flavour. This could be because I brought it home? But 15 mins couldn't have been that long.   The coleslaw was tangy and not creamy, and tasty. And I don't usually like coleslaw.  I'll be coming back here, maybe quite frequently. I love the option for gluten free, and grilled.   They also have a myriad of sandwich and poutine options."}
{"text":"After getting my haircut in Chinatown, I was in the mood to try something a little different than my usual fare of foods. So I decided to try Off The Hook. I walk in around 6 pm and the place was just under half full. I was seated pretty quickly. The place is different from your average mom and pops fish and chips store,  a waiter/waitress looks after you instead of a cafeteria style, where you are assigned  a number and you go up and get your food when it's ready  and they also have a decent size alcohol menu that covers all the popular basics.  I decided to try something simple so I ordered the Mahi Mahi fish and chips combo ($12). The order came with a choice of fresh cut fries, cajun fries or onion rings and a side of coleslaw (creamy or vinaigrette) and with a choice of one of their signature sauces. I decided on the fresh cut fries, the creamy coleslaw and their walking wasabi sauce.  The creamy coleslaw was just average, it's definitely not creamy enough in my opinion. The fresh cut fries were good but not great, the fries were fresh and crispy but not too crispy but it could have used a little bit more seasoning. The Mahi Mahi was excellent, the meat inside was moist and tender like advertised and the batter was light and crispy but not too crispy and most of all not oily at all. Their wasabi tartar sauce was really good and had a nice kick to it. The portions were of a fair size.  The service was good and the place was clean. Overall I would say Off The Hook is pretty good and definitely better than your random mom and pops fish and chips store and it's reasonably priced for what your getting. Also, they have a decent size menu with other offerings other than fish and chips."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to give it another go.  I had another fish sandwich (no fries as it is extra).  The sandwich was good. Again too much bun.  but now that I've gotten over that it's going to cost me around $10 for the sandwich, I'm okay with it and would go back."}
{"text":"Ordered a few things from them as takeout.   Fish and chips. Average. Fries were a little soggy, despite the fact I ordered them extra crispy.   Crab cakes. Good, but like $8 for one small crab cake. Size not matching price.   Shrimp taco. Sauce was good, shrimp fresh. No complaints.    Overall, I feel place is not bad, but slight overpriced."}
{"text":"Well due to being forced to take driving school by my newly minted wife (what was I thinking right?) I stumbled on to this incredible cozy little spot down by Broadview Ave   What first caught my eye was the chicken fingers for 5 dollars then saw if you wanted to add 3 more with extra fries was 4 dollars more. Coming from downtown where two chicken strips are 11.99 and considered a meal this place was already a win for me.  Upon entry I was warmly greeted by the cashier who was happy to take my order and advised me of the specials they currently had (I always love that type of service).  While waiting I took in the decor which had a extreme pub feel but just enough space to still give it an intimate feel.   When the food came out it was incredibly hot (another plus) and the fries had that 'ye ol English' feel that I really look for in a fish and chips joint. The chicken strips where HUGE, tasty and lightly breaded. When compared to other spots I would say this would be a normal $19.99 meal.   The sauce I had was the normal plum one but they have approximately 12 different ones based on the menu posted on the wall.  While I couldn't finish my meal as I had a short break time I was excited to find such value in East York and without a doubt I will be back to try the 5 dollar burger....tomorrow!"}
{"text":"The ghost of Off The Hook's predecessor \"Deep Blue\" certainly lives on, but has confusingly reincarnated into a more \"gourmet\" FISH AND CHIPS (!?) establishment --- which should have clued me in on what was to come...   Delicious enough to make me want to come back, slightly over-priced enough to make me not want to come back (depending on what's ordered), feeling not-quite-full, and oozing with laid-back cool, border-lining hipster.  Partner and I ordered two meals on a sunny Saturday lunch - Grilled trout with vinagrette coleslaw and Pi in the Sky Poutine ($17) and house-battered catch of the day with creamy coleslaw and onion rings ($12), plus two bottled soft drinks. Bill came to $40 all-in.  The great - Flavour and service! Batter and frymanship were crisp and light for the halibut and rings. Poutine was very interesting with varied aromas and textures. Service was chipper and quick.  The meh - Portions and pricing configuration. There were 7-8 onion rings of varying sizes along with the single portion of fish, while the grilled trout portion was downright disappointing, coming out to be slightly larger than a halved deck of cards. The Poutine was an exta $5 on top of the standard options, which may have made more sense if the reasoning was clear as to why - maybe something incredibly gourmet about it?  Other thoughts - Some imagination into the coleslaw variations and presentation would help, considering the variety of sauces and batter they came up with. Coleslaw choices were A) Creamy; and B) Vinagrette, both served in little plastic container resembling those serving economy-class aircabin salads (nooooo that was not snobbery --- I always take economy class!).   So the resounding issue I'm struggling with here is ... I'm still not sure whether announcing one is a gourmet fish and chips shop is trying too hard, a bit misleading, or endearing in the aww-the-owner-loves-his-art kind of way? What clientele are they trying to woo here? While the flavour and portions could maybe defend its self-claimed \"gourmet\" status, its fundamental cuisine and ambience betrays itself. To be fair, I haven't tried the other non-fish items so I will likely return for one more go, so to-be-continued much later."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a 4 but there were just a couple of things that fell short for me. Firstly I have to say that fish and chips would be my ultimate dying day meal so I'm a hard customer to please. My friend and I both had halibut, he went for battered and I had grilled - both did not disappoint! The fish prep and taste was great. However it was the fries that kind of let me down. Hey tasted quite burnt or maybe that's because the oil was old? Not sure. But they weren't the best. Also the restaurant decor is a bit weird. I could barely see my friend's face as it was dim and the walls were black and it was lit by random Christmas lights. If you're in the area and craving fish and chips this isn't a bad place to have it. But I wouldn't cross town for this."}
{"text":"Stopped here today for an early on the fly dinner. Didn't know what to expect, I haven't had my lot of fish chips in my day. But the food was good. I had the mahi mahi with the Cajun batter and creamy jalapeño ranch dipping sauce. My boyfriend had the same fish with the original batter and his was quite tasty as well. The portion sizes were generous. They had a variety of beverage options consisting of specialty sodas and craft beers. The service was acceptable, though I was there when it was really slow. Overall it's a nifty neighbourhood must try for any fish and chip fan."}
{"text":"I frequent this place quite often.  They use fresh fish, a  good variety of batters & sides & the wait times are low & service is pretty attentive."}
{"text":"Went here at about 9pm on Saturday night. Vibe wasn't the best. But I guess they were starting to close down. I got takeout Halibut and Fries w/ creamy coleslaw. Overall it was good even by the time I got home and plated it. I don't have too much Fish n'Chips experience, but I enjoyed what I received. Wasn't crazy about the creamy coleslaw - but that could've just been me. Next time I'm going to go for the vinegar based one.  My main disappointment was that I didn't have malt vinegar at home. Would be nice if they included some packets in the bag.   Overall - I'm looking forward to going back there."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here drop everything and go. The menu is clear. There are starters and then there is the fish. The fish menu makes it easy. Choose your favourite sea dweller. The prices are marked beside it with the exception to the cod and halibut which have market costs. So just ask. The day I went, the cod was the special and cost $14. The next thing to choose is the batter (choices are organic, gluten free, etc). Then choose your side (fries, poutine, sweet potato fries, onion rings etc.). Then choose your dipping sauce (chipotle, tarter, curry, etc.) and the type of cole slaw (vinegar or creamy). The kitchen is right when you walk in and visible to anyone around. The place is clean and the beer and drink menu is good quality. They even have signs saying that they only serve good drinks (no pabst or colt 45). Great place. Not fancy. And the bathroom is on the main level (which is not easy to find in Toronto). Street parking available and there is pay parking at the loblaws across the street. Drop everything and go now!  You've been told."}
{"text":"I had the halibut+frings with coleslaw, took a bit of waiting and it wasn't bad at all but for the price/size of portions I believe it was almost $20 for a small to average sized piece of fish, I'd stick with B&B fish & chips when I'm craving for it"}
{"text":"The mahi-mahi fish was great! But the sweet potato fries were too soggy. Not overly impressed by this place."}
{"text":"This is a nice, laid-back place that advertises fish-and-chips, but serves plenty of other seafood options. I stopped by for a lunch, was immediately welcomed by the staff, and got my food fairly quickly. I had mahi-mahi tacos, which were great. Excellent fresh fish, grilled just right, and creatively balanced with pickled vegetables and mango. The taco shells were a little stale and tough, but still delicious.  Sadly, the fish was over-salted -- an unfortunate staple of many seafood places. Heavy salt is often used to mask poorly made (or non-fresh) seafood. The fish here was far too good for it, and they should season more conservatively, trusting in the good quality of their ingredients. It was a little pricey, but still in reasonable range."}
{"text":"I see there are lots of great reviews on this place and but have to give this place a poor review.  It's 6pm on a Sunday evening and while I completely understand that they must be so busy and their food is  \"off the hook\" - I'm disappointed in the service.  I won't be trying this place soon.  I called for a take out order, completely understanding that they must be slammed but hopefully picking up my order even if it took a long time.  Voicemail.  I thought, \"oh, maybe they aren't open Sunday\".  Tried again after checking that they were.  Then, someone picked up and he asked me to hold and that there was only one server and he \"had a lot of food to cook\".  I said \"no problem.\"  6 minutes later, I was hung up on.  Next call - voicemail.    If you aren't able to take take out orders, I get that.  I'm glad a neighbourhood establishment is so successful.  But just say so.  Just say, \"we can't take orders right now but we'd love to see if you came in.\" Or something that was more courteous.  Too bad, really was ready to pay $40 for fish and chips."}
{"text":"I didn't realize that this is more a sit down place where people take your order... my impression was that you line up and place your order, and pick a table while food gets brought out to you .. but i was wrong!  The place is small and there are a few 2-seaters along the front, with 4 tops in the back. Everything is cooked along the front pass so you can see all the action. Not a lot of space but lots of cooking happening. While fries are bring deep fried, there are also platters resting as order gets filled up.  At $12 for one piece of fish, it may be a little bit pricey but luckily it was tasty and comes with a few items that you may not be able to find anywhere else. We got the mahi mahi which was very lightly battered, not overly crispy and not soggy either. The batter did not separate from the fish which happens way too often. In terms of batter, we selected the cajun spice - a first where we can select the type of batter for the fish. We asked for a recommendation on what sauce we should eat it with and went with the jalepeno ranch (*a first away from traditional tartar). Lastly, the choice between creamy or vinegrette coleslaw - one would feel like royalty with all this customization! Everything tasted great - the ranch definitely had an awesome kick to it and blended well with the spice of the batter. The fries were okay... but had some good potato beneath the deep fried goodness. The coleslaw was not overly sauced and had some good tang and crisp.  We also got a crab cake (I really did not want to ask whether it was real or canned), and it was steep at $7 / 5 oz crab cake....when it arrived, I'm not sure it was actually 5 ounces. It seemed over cooked as the outside looked charred and dark in colour. The cake was thinner than I would have liked, although the taste on the inside was quite pleasant. I thought there would be a bit more flavour but not overly disappointed. Maybe for the extra dollar, it would have been better to get the actual sandwich, which comes with lettuce, tomato, and the bun.  A TV in the back was playing classic movies... thought the hockey game would air but no biggie.  There are a lot of fish and chips places in the area... I'm glad I checked it out and will come back but have to scout out the competition first!"}
{"text":"A great choice to dine-in during the downtime hours of the day. Friendly staff who welcome you and are more than happy to help you through the menu. Ordered a few raw oysters as my starter with house battered halibut for my entree. All in all a very tasty meal. Fries were a bit overcooked but nothing to get riled up about. Amazing decorum with a cool grungy atmosphere. Would go here again! They have many customers who always buy for take-out, but dining in alone is also great."}
{"text":"I love this place ! I've never been anywhere with so so so many gluten free options, even deep fried calamari! The service here is also amazing.  If you go here try the fish tacos they are the best !"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic fish restaurant. I work in a medical building a few blocks away and it's a convenient location for me in which to have lunch. I go there almost daily for lunch. There's a great variety of the freshest fish. You can ask the staff , Gus ,Chad or Steve what they recommend and they will gladly tell you what has just come in from either the Pacific or the Atlantic coast or from any of the Great Lakes. The salad is nice and crisp. The cole slaw is one of the best I've ever had. The sweet potato fries are perfectly done. The service and staff are efficient courteous and friendly. The decor and the music may not be great but I don't even notice them because I go there for the food."}
{"text":"A great place for some good Ol' Fish & Chips!  The guys behind the counter are super friendly, and their fish taste super fresh and not previously frozen like many places. They have a Gluten Free batter which is a plus, and their fries are crispy, even after half an hour in the heat. It's easy to miss, especially because it's so busy on this part of Broadview and parking is limited on the street."}
{"text":"Visited for dinner over the long weekend with my boyfriend.  Halibut fish & chips was delectable. Perfect texture and tenderness to the fish. Loved the option of subbing in tasty salads for the fries (goat cheese salad very refreshing)."}
{"text":"basically a resurrection of deep blue (although I'm pretty sure not related in any way) http://www.yelp.ca/biz/deep-blue-fish-and-chips-toronto  I got the red snapper with a traditional batter and chips with their homemade tartar sauce. They have a ton of options for dips and batters, its all organic and - everything is made in the house, everything. My partner got Cajun battered sea bass and onion rings with chipotle mayo.  All the food here is stupendous, I was blown away by the quality of the food.  the fries had great flavor and texture, both crispy and mushy with a perfect balance of batter and potato taste, same goes for the fish, the ideal harmony between batter and fish was achieved. The Cajun fish had an excellent spicy Cajun flavor as it should.   I hate coleslaw but the coleslaw here was really good! (our waiter told us it isn't mayo based, like the coleslaw usually is)   I don't think I'm making much sense but my point is, delicious and consistent- if you are in the east come here for your fish and chips!  also they have 4.50 pints of mill street :)"}
{"text":"I'm so delighted Off the Hook has opened in my neighbourhood. Finally a great fish 'n chip joint to replace the void filled by Deep Blue. It might be in the same location, but the menu certainly offers classier and tastier versions of this beloved cuisine.   I ordered the halibut, battered in the homemade organic batter. The batter is fairly light, and the fish is definitely not overwhelmed by it. The sauce I chose, from a list of about six unique sauce variations, was Lost in the Sauce, which offered a lovely light-tasting alternative to typical tartar sauce. I highly approve of the thick cut fries. And the ketchup was real Heinz (as some people know this is a pet peeve of mine when resto's don't offer good ketchup!).  My dinner companion enjoyed the red snapper with Homemade Tartar sauce and sweet potato fries. The s.p. fries came with a killer spicy sauce (two thumbs up).  We drank Mill Street Organic Lager. They also have Tankhouse on tap here.  A nice informal dining room in this teeny joint, perfect for a casual date, but not great for groups over six due to the small space/tables.  I will definitely be coming back soonest for more yummy fish!"}
{"text":"Two of us went here for lunch on the weekend they first opened so obviously there must have been a lot of kinks that got worked out, due to all the rave reviews. For us, it was a huge disappointment. The fish batter was unremarkable, a tad greasy and the chips were just plain awful. Also HATED their coleslaw. Couldn't even finish it. Like I said, maybe we just hit it on a bad day - a REALLY bad day because every time I pass by, they are very busy and on a Saturday night, it was packed. So we stick to our old, reliable standby which is Olde Yorke. Maybe we should give them another try."}
{"text":"This place has an identity crisis. It promotes gourmet food but appears like a basement bar. The walls are plastered with stickers and posters. The lighting is limited and it's an open kitchen.  I came here with my dad and we were both underwhelmed with the food. My dad thought it was tasteless while I agree with the reviewer who called the fish meaty.  We both ordered what should have been flavourful fish and were both disappointed. I enjoyed the accompanying chips but dad didn't agree.  In a world where there are so many stand-alone fish and chip shops, I think we'll be looking elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to bring your friend who can't eat the organic batter and must have the gluten-free batter. He/She will thank you for being so brilliant and you will get to eat fantastic fish and chips. The homemade tartar sauce is excellent, the chips have a spicy kick to them (AMAZING!) and I wanted to eat everything that was on the menu.   They have different kinds of poutine, fish and many different snack options (including clamari and shrimp).  I recommend trying the different mayos and the cajun spice."}
{"text":"Places with gluten-free fish and chips are practically unheard of. And quite often you'll be told something is gluten-free, only to realize later that it's been fried in the same batter as everything else, and whammo, you're having a flare-up. This isn't like that. They fry all their gluten-free fish and chips in separate oil, and the batter's delicious - not like most gluten-free versions of restaurant food. The one drawback is the only gluten-free beer they have (or at least the only one they had back when I was there) is Nickelbrook, which tastes positively like it's been run off someone's boots. Overall, worth visiting, though."}
{"text":"We love our fish and chip, so we were excited to try this restaurant! The food was great, but a bit pricey for the portion sizes. Service was great and we will probably be back if we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Stopped by there to try their halibut sandwich to go. I wish it was on a better bread. It's nice that it was warmed up, but it's too thick/dry? Enjoyed the sandwich with the cucumber cilantro sauce.   It's a fish and chips joint, I didn't expect much. I went after lunch hours so the chef, the cashier, was a bit slow or just coming back in from their break. I was asked by both server and chef what I ordered, in total 3 times. It ended with, you want a drink with that (after I paid and they were packing the sandwich)? I asked does it come with it? The cashier said, \"if you want it to be?\" What kind of answer is that? Are you charging extra or not for drinks then? Menu doesn't explain either. I'm clueless here.   I have to say, when I ate my sandwich it was alright. I had a problem when I was carrying it in my take out bag that smelled down right fishy. I didn't smell yummy, just fishy which is embarrassing.    I would go to the Fish Store for my next sandwich. Maybe I'll come back here just for fish and chips."}
{"text":"This place is really great. Came here for dinner on Friday night, it was not so busy and had an  aromatic feel to it as the kitchen was just right there.  I had the bass with cajun batter, cajun fries jalapenos ranch dipping sauce, and vinegrette coleslaw. The fish was so fresh and juicy, I some crumbs of soft pieces slathered onto the fries and ate that too.  On top of that, we had ordered calamari and crab cakes, these were also juicy, fresh, and exploding with flavor and delight!"}
{"text":"Fish is good, really good. Love how you could have so many different options for fish choices. Chips is only ok. Onion rings are not the same as the regular onions, a little too crispy.  I had ordered the house organic batter mahi mahi - very light, not really heavy. Creamy coleslaw is flavourless. Shared the O.T.H Poutine which was ok but not for me. Will go back to try the pull pork or duck confit one.   Good for gluten free. =)"}
{"text":"Treated my dad to a fish'n'chips dinner here back in the fall. We both ordered the halibut, which was fried nicely.  Having a variety of dipping sauces for your fries is a great option; I've been to other places and all they have is ketchup.  Can't wait to go back on Saturday !"}
{"text":"The food here is good - no complaints in that department... And to be frank this is the most important part.  BUT the atmosphere is beyond forgiving. The black painted walls and rock music make me want to cringe. My fiance usually gets takeout from here, but the one time we decided to eat in the restaurant, we couldn't stand it, and we asked for our order to go. It was a hot summer day, and who wants to spend it eating in a dark black hole? Furthermore, the tables were beyond uncomfortable.  I have no idea what the owners are thinking in terms of the decor, do they really think black walls & awful rock music make for a pleasant dining experience? They need to think from the customer's perspective on this one."}
{"text":"I was so upset when Deep Blue closed because it is impossible to find good gluten free fish and chips.  So I rejoiced when Off the Hook opened in its place and rejoiced again when I finished eating!  The fish and chips serving is huge.  The gf batter was light and not greasy.  Fries were good too.  The coleslaw was average.  The only thing that upset me was that they don't serve hot beverages, really?, I really wanted a hot tea!  My husband had the regular batter and enjoyed his too.  Stating the batter was not too heavy as well.  I am going to make a habit of going to this place every couple of months!!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place in this entire shithole of a city. This restaurant makes the giant pile of shit that is Toronto a little bearable. If this place ever closed down I would move countries. The service is amazing. The food is outstanding. The atmosphere is phenomenal. Everything is above what you expect from a tiny place like this. Don't miss your chance to go, is fricken amazing. Don't go anywhere else but here. Seriously. Drop your shit right now and go get a burger or Mahi Mahi or rainbow trout, and I swear to god you won't regret it. If you do, I'll personally suck your d*ck"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere, the food, and the beer. My only issue with the shrimp and fish tacos were that they used only one thin soft shell so it was literally impossible to eat without it falling apart at first bite."}
{"text":"Great spot. Finally a good fish & chips joint in Toronto!  There's no reason fish/chips has to be depressing and greasy.  Why not have a hip joint with great ingredients?  Why not offer good microbrews and a lively environment?  OTH answers the call on all counts .   What's not to like?  (1) no kids' menu.  That's a big setback for us.  (2) A teevee in the corner, silently showing garbage that is inappropriate for children and annoying to adults.  What's the point of videos that no one can hear and no one is watching?  It cheapens the place.  (3) The prices are a bit more than you might expect for fish/chips, but not bad. (4) expect a wait on Friday and Saturday nights: this place is popular!  Bottom line: everything is made with care and skill.  Interesting sauces make the experience more interesting and less redundant.  The sandwiches, fish, chips... everything is high quality."}
{"text":"Today I tried this fish and chips again and it just went downhill, the halibut fish was not fresh and it has a foul smell, the salad was stale and I did not eat it. The restaurant looks dirty and it has a mouldy smell everywhere. It's a complete waste of time and money. I will never go back there again. You want a great fish and chips go to Old Yorke Fish and Chips in Laird. It's always fresh and there's is a line-up"}
{"text":"The quality of the fish is very good. But the sides are disappointing. The fries taste old and burnt. The duck in the duck poutine was very dry and no flavor, never mind all that the poutine was missing cheese. I can say that the Service was good."}
{"text":"Meh. went in with high expectations. I've definitely had better fish and chips. Old Yorke is a little more authentic.   This place isn't bad, but it's not the best fish and chips in the city.   I do like the CSR component and the gluten free options. That's the only reason i'd come back - it's not that the taste will bring me back."}
{"text":"Ate here with a group of friends for a birthday celebration.  I ordered the red snapper in traditional batter with frings, vinagrette coleslaw and tartar sauce (which was a recommendation from the server, who said they make it in house).  The good:   - Friendly service. - Quality of fish and batter: I had the red snapper, which was very tasty and beautifully cooked. - Great atmosphere - casual, comfy. - Vinaigrette coleslaw had a complex fermented / kosher dill flavour that was unique and delish.  The bad: - Service. Had to ask to order our food after waiting for over 30 minutes.  We had drinks, but by 8 we hadn't ordered food and the restaurant closes at 9.  Also, our server forgot multiple drink orders and needed to be reminded periodically. - Portioning.  I watched several beautiful haddock fillets in the 4-5 oz size hit the table in front of my friends.  When my snapper arrived, it was at best 1.5 oz  :(.  If the portions of fish are that drastically different, PLEASE put that on the menu.  I felt ripped off. - Tartar sauce.  The server hyped the tartar sauce, made in house.  I was saddened when my fish arrived with essentially a cup of store bought mayonnaise.  There was no discernible mince of pickle or fresh herbs.  Overall, good fish and chips, but overpriced given the lack of attention to detail in portioning and service.  Fix the portioning problem (or post the fillet sizes in oz on the menu).  TL/DR:  Tasty fish. Overpriced restaurant."}
{"text":"Off The Hook Part Three  Good news! I got in ....and I was served right away! Surprising right? And I was served within 10 minutes. So good job on that front! I did come right after work on a Friday night so about 5:40 probably before their rush. I probably wouldn't come during peak times given that the staff don't seem to be particularly urgent when there are crowds.   VIBE  I felt like I was in a Poison video. Let me explain: dark, dim lighting; red tables with faint mustard chairs with black backing; mirrors along the back wall and grey walls on the other side and a bar in the back. It was very 80s redux. I like the menu chalk boards and think they convey the menu better than the menu you get at the table. It's not very inviting. And there's a huge draft in the room (that others noted) if you're up near the front.  The only thing missing was a smoke machine and scantily clad young women with big hair.   Staff seem inexperienced. They have enough staff for when it gets busy but when it's not as busy, they're kind of just standing around or off with their timing.  And I hadn't even had a bite of my meal when the waiter came over and asked me how my meal was...he apologized but the staff waiting around and fiddling made me feel kind of nervous. At another table the waiter didn't know the name of the cheese on a patron's salad. Then when I needed to leave, my waiter was nowhere to be found. On top of this, there's table service but I had to go up to the cash to pay? It's just a bit disorganized.   If I do come back, I'll be taking out. Not sure if they do delivery.   I ATE  Halibut and frings with creamy coleslaw. The halbut was good but it was over battered. The fish was flaky, I just wish I could have tasted a bit more of it. That said, I'd get it again.   There are also many other options on the fish - like snapper and crab cakes. I think this is also where OTH stands out from its competition. I'm curious about the crab cakes.   OTH does options really well. I loved that I could get frings: a mix of onion rings and fries. Portions are plentiful. You also get many options on the sauces. I got the classic tartar sauce (a bit too much of a mayo flavour for my taste) but for those who don't like tartar you can get something like chipotle. Good job on that front! I didn't care too much for the creamy coleslaw. It didn't taste good. Perhaps a mini side salad instead as an option?   And a note on the iced tea: it's the Arizona 591 ml. Given that I was rushing because another table wanted to sit where I was sitting because they were cold where they were sitting (I offered them my table), my iced tea wasn't even half done. I needed the lid but the waiter had it and the staff even offered to put a condiment container on it. Um....!!! So I pretty much wasted my iced tea. It would have been nice if the actual waiter was around. Anyways, with experience I'm sure these issues will be smoothed over.    OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Got the bait but not totally off the hook yet."}
{"text":"Went last night for a friend who requested \"Fish & Chips\" for his birthday meal.    Service was really good.   My friend has some incredibly specific dietary requirements and the guy serving us was very patient, and did his best to help.  I liked the variety of available sauces to accompany the fish. The food however, didn't really blow me away.  I ordered the Halibut & Frings, with Tartar and Creamy Coleslaw (see pic).  Although it was good, it wasn't the best I've had.   The fish itself was a nice big piece, but I found the batter and tartar to be a bit bland.  The fries and onion ring combo were tasty! It isn't often establishments make their own onion rings (made with red spanish onions).  Nice touch  I'd give \"Off The Hook\" four stars if I hadn't had Fresco's first.  If you're a lover of pub style fish 'n' chips, this is definitely worth trying, however there are better options out there."}
{"text":"Fish was good quality, but the portion a bit on the small side.  Same goes for the coleslaw - it was nice, but not much on the plate.  Fries were above average, way too many for me to want to finish."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food! The fish and chips were fantastic, but fairly small portions for the price you are paying. This is probably due to the fact that the fish is fresh and local.   I like the atmosphere of the restaurant - everything is open and visible, the staff is knowledgeable and competent.  Went with my fiance. I had the gluten free and he had the regular. We both really enjoyed our meal, and I can't even express how happy I was to find a place where I can finally enjoy fish and chips again. It's something I have missed very much! I can't say whether this place has better fish and chips than another place, because I am limited due to my gluten allergy, but I can say with confidence that in terms of gluten free fish and chips, I was very impressed!   We will be back for sure - If we lived closer, I'm sure we would be there even more."}
{"text":"The music here is weird, not suited to the rest of the vibe and I didn't like it.  I will still be returning to eat here regularly; my food was good.  What was good: - the value - there was a LOT of food for $11. - the dipping sauces - I notoriously hate almost all dipping sauces because... well they are just usually really shitty. (Adding curry powder to mayonaise isn't something I want a side of.) I had the Wasabi here today and it was fantastic. It was in the style of a tartar sauce and I liked the consistency and the flavour. - the fish... I was a little disappointed that there wasn't any swordfish today like I had read in other reviews, but the mahi mahi was really good. - the cajun fries were tasty but they were soggy. - there was a huge variety of cold drinks including coke in glass bottles (+1 star).  What was not great for me as a matter of personal taste: - the batter was a bit thick - red pepper in the coleslaw - at first I was like \"oh!  mmm... yeah, that's good\" - but then as I kept eating I didn't want it to be there anymore. Maybe keep it in there, but have less. - music - Damien Rice while I wait for fish and chips (to be served to be by a guy witha  leather skull bracelet) just didn't do it for me.   Overall, I will certainly eat here again. I don't think it's as good as reliable on Queen East and they remain my fish & chips champion. It's good to have options though (and Off the Hook also has beer)."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and knowledgeable. I hadn't had fish & chips in two years since I'd been diagnosed with Celiac disease. When I walked in and discovered I could have onion rings and poutine I was over the moon.   Onion rings - good, fresh and crispy Halibut with poutine - the halibut was so fresh and firm and perfectly complimented by the light crispy batter! The poutine was also delicious and cheese curdy. The house made tartar sauce creamy and garlicky. As I write this review I want to go back right now!"}
{"text":"The gluten free haddock strips were excellent.  Not greasy at all.  The gluten free onion rings had too much batter, but the fries were nice and crispy.  Excellent tartar sauce, and hubby loved the curry mayo.  Service was attentive, but I wish they would bring the food out as ready... I saw the cone of fries sitting on the counter waiting for the fish and onion rings, so by the time it got to the table it had cooled a bit.    Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"friendly service and good fish and chips. very close to broadview subway station"}
{"text":"I pass Off The Hook twice a day going to work and I've never yet tried it though I've been tempted.  Fish and chips and my waistline just don't get along... go figure.  But I put that aside yesterday and finally stopped by for an early  sinful dinner en route home.  We were served instantly and the guy was totally friendly, fully answering all our questions about the menu.  I went all out and had the organic battered Mahi-mahi, frings, vinaigrette coleslaw, and chipotle mayo because I wanted to try something close to the fish n' chip classic.  No complaints; everything was prepared well though I had a bite of the grilled Rainbow Trout with the walking wasabi.  I have to say I preferred it.  Next time, I'm going grill.  The interior is a little odd, but it's clean and functional, so I'm down."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and I reckon food tastes better back a year ago. The menu and variety seemed to have increased over time serving more variety and choices.  It is still a great place to go for fish and chips and the variety of beer they have. Love the clan chowder soup, as it's not too big not to creamy. It had a perfect blend of taste. I usually go for mahi mahi as it's abit sweeter and meat is more dense. What makes this place different is the doing sauce - from mild to spicy ones. You got to come back to try it all."}
{"text":"Wow, service is really bad.  We stopped by to order pick-up. The staff was unhelpful and a little rude. Never again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times since my first visit. Sill loving it and still proving to be celiac friendly as I have never had a reaction.  The only cons to this place so far...  1) on one occasion the gf batter was WAY too thick on both the vegan 'fish' (eggplant) and onion rings. Though I think this can happen at any fish and chips joint....just means the person who made it used too much batter  2) Upgraded to vegan poutine once. Yuck. They use daiya (as many places to in place of cheese) and I hate daiya lol. The surcharge to poutine my fries was $5 and it was very small and i just ate around the cheese so not worth it at all (also my fault since I should have known it would be daiya cheese). Now I just stick to onion rings with each order!  But overall still great and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Market price mahi mahi fish and chips was $15 - amazing value for what you get! You can customize everything, so you know it's fresh. The batter, the onion rings were all top notch. Would personally recommend the vinaigrette slaw for a more pickled taste. Definitely would come back if I'm ever craving fish and chips."}
{"text":"A great find for this celiac girl.  The service was awesome, attentive but not too much. Enjoyed a gluten free snowman beer and gluten free calamari and onion rings! Upon asking the server( who was also the owner) I was told they have a dedicated fryer and kitchen prep area!  I would definitely go back again!  Great atmosphere all be it a small space."}
{"text":"Great gluten free fish and chips, onion rings, poutine......."}
{"text":"The fish is great, but that's about it. Will stick with old yorke for my fish and chips cravings.  We ordered the halibut with onion rings, and then also had an order of fries on the side. The fish was great: fresh, flaky, moist. I'd say it's a regular sized portion for this city. The red onion rings were pretty good, although perhaps a bit heavy on the batter, I would probably order them again. (with a balsamic mayo, that'd be good eats!) The fries were mushy and unseasoned, clearly just prepared wrong. If you're a fish and chips joint, your chips should be de-lish. Period. No amount of pepper, salt, or malt vinegar could fix them. The staff were fine, attentive but we were the only ones there so it's hard to fuck that up. The decor really quite lacking: plain, empty, very basic tables (ours almost fell over) and chairs.  I do like that they have beer on tap, and a decent selection of bottles, all at a good price.  Overall, I paid $26, and I can think of a lot of other food that I'd rather have spent it on. Glad to have tried the place though, and will probably be back for a deep fried Mars bar at some point :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 4 times and I truly love their fish and chips!  They have different types of fish you can choose from and they are all truly delicious.  I love Fresco's fish and chips. I tell you, it is hard for me to decide which one reigns supreme, so I have to put both of them at the top of my list.  They both have their uniqueness and the food is delicious.  Try out their Salmon Fish and Chips, it is EPIC!  Plus, try out their Poutines.  They use Duck Gravy, which is totally new for me, but delicious nevertheless."}
{"text":"First of all a confession... I have gone to this place a few times and have always avoided providing a review because I would like to give it more than three stars.  They deserve more!  The fish is always excellent, whether grilled or fried.  They use fresh oil and the fish is fresh.  One of the better fish shops in the East End  However......  Every time I have gone there has always been a problem with our order.  The first time, they forgot an item; the second time we had to remind them of the order of my companion; more recently, the sweet potato fries were burnt beyond recognition.  If you tell them before you leave the store, they will correct the order, and often they will give you something extra to compensate for their mistake.  But considering they have been opened for a few years now, they should not still be making junior mistakes (if the sweet potatoes are brownish-black rather than orange...they are burnt!).  Come for the fish and check your order before you leave the door.  You will thank me."}
{"text":"For those who are looking for fish and chips - go right in. For those looking for a Gluten Free Fish and Chips option...go right in! They have a designated fryer, so no worries about cross contamination. Great portions and a wide variety of dips, drinks and food options besides Fish and Chips. Food comes in hot and is not sitting under a heat lap like some other places."}
{"text":"Very tasty gluten-free fish and chips! Lovely GF onion rings too, with fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"short and sweet  went on a sunday before a concert...they were closed with no notice in the window  was pretty upset given the high reviews on yelp...went next door instead..."}
