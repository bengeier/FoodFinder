{"text":"Yelpers! ~ another little place you've all missed out on ... read on & go have a try!  Atmosphere: Just lovely ~ A family owed place about a decade or so into operation, Vago is a little hard to find on Greene Ave.  It is located right across the street from the Oink Oink toy store (great place too!) ... just look up to see it.  It's a mid to upscale type of restaurant, decked out almost totally in wood panelling.  Very cozy, homely, and extremely well kept.  You'll love going there on a special date or inviting family or business associates for a meal.  Vago also offers the opportunity to dine outside whenever the weather permits.  Service: Very impressed.  The maître d' (they have a maître d') is well informed about the foods and offers advice, help, as well as accommodations whenever required.  The staff is pleasant, well organized, and very polite.  Professionalism is tops here.  Food: Top marks here as well.  A generous, yet not over-crowded menu, offers a variety of pasta and anti-pasta dishes, rissoto as well as grilled steaks, chicken, and sea-food offerings.  An extensive wine list complements the menu and is sure to include vintages for most requests.  I personally loved the fact that they also offer much of their pasta, risotto, and dessert dishes glutton free (call to confirm / reserve this option first).  Classy, classy place - loved it the first and second time there .. and many more to come.  It's great to be back :O)"}
{"text":"While the decor is appealing, the server we had and the food we ordered was underwhelming.  The server, who is older, appears to differentiate between patrons as to whom he provides top quality service to.  We overheard him telling patrons about the specials and had to ask him what they were.   His attitude was too big for the restaurant.  We have had more flavourful spaghetti bolognese and veal Limonata.  We had amazing experiences at the Taj and the Bonaparte in Montreal (been going for 20 years travelling from Vancouver).  Would not return to Vago!"}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant, especially good for business dinners, very good service, and the food is high in quality. Last night for dinner I had the tomato and bacon soup and a breaded chicken for the main which were both very good. I have been here before and has the seafood pasta which is amazing."}
{"text":"Been with our family, many times. A great local restaurant for us.  Excellent food and outstanding service. Lee love it!"}
{"text":"The food was good the people were nice and the place is just so cool especially the private rooms.  The only reason I gave a 4 and not a 4 1/2 or a 5 is because I found my food a bit salty and my mom said also her food had a bit too much salt.  All in all I definitely recommend this restaurant.... Go and enjoy"}
{"text":"Perhaps it was because it was a Monday night. Perhaps the owner was off that night. Whatever the reason, our group of four were very disappointed in our experience. The staff tried to make up for the long wait between our appetizers and the mains but apologies don't help once you've lost patience and appetites. The food was acceptable though not outstanding. Three of us ordered seafood linguini; two arrived piping hot and a third was too cold to eat. And we all know that when you send something back once you've waited too long to get it in the first place, the evening is now a bust. To their credit they did remove the charge for the returned linguini and coffees were on the house. However, with so many good Italian restaurants in Montreal, it's not likely we'll return.  Please note, that on our last visit which was not on a Monday, I had absolutely no complaints. The owner was on the premises and made a special effort to assure our dining experience was perfect."}
{"text":"My aunt has been going here for a very long time and it shows they respect her. We had ordered a shiraz which one waiter said was very good, well it wasn't and they kindly replaced it with another choice. Food as usual was very good, the ladies had veal and I opted for pasta."}
{"text":"This italian resto is little overpriced for the food received. Nothing really impressed me."}
{"text":"Magnifique! The ambiance is warm, the staff accommodating, and the food delicious! Merci beaucoup!! The owners are hands on. I had the porcini papperadelle/ribbon pasta-delectable.  So good that I returned tonight for their entrecôte/ribeye. Prices are reasonable for upscale Italian. Steven-is a wonderful, kind, knowledgable server. Thank you."}
{"text":"A solid choice for Italian fare. Service is top notch as is the food. Been here  many times and never disappointed. Recommend the linguine pescatore highly."}
{"text":"Great vibe at this restaurant ! Lots of vegetables, expertly done! I love salads and am rarely as happy and satisfied with portions and quality of ingredients as at Vago! Discrete, well versed in the art of service, the waiters are excellent ! Mangia!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I had taken a photo. Our friends said that the restaurant had just remodeled and it seems there are no new pics here yet. It's beautiful, bright modern Italian, elegant. The waitstaff are handsome in their white suits and very attentive. My husband and I were visiting from NY. Lunch was superb. The octopus, calamari, and veal dishes delicious. Filet mignon like butter! So tender, cooked to perfection. The only minor disappointments being I would have preferred a bigger, silkier Cabernet available by the glass to go with my filet and I did not get the rapini to go with the steak as stated on the menu.  I would gladly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Italian restaurants are a dime a dozen in this city.  This one however, Is amazing.   The blueberry gnocchi is a great discovery.  I will definitely bring friends there."}
{"text":"Wow. I loved everything about this place. Apparently it was renovated pretty recently and the ambiance is lovely. Modern but warm. Hospitality front and center.   We came with a party of 10, plus a baby. They were incredibly accommodating, and everyone loved their food. The minestrone soup and bolognese were particularly wonderful."}
{"text":"Never been here before and I have to admit, the rose sauce is top. Complex yet simple tasting with bursting flavours. I also had the muscles which were not fresh due to the fishy after taste. Never had any other dish, but the rose is a must have. Cool restaurant, cool location, this place should be packed out the door unless the other dishes are terrible."}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves some praise on several points: the decor, the ambiance, the staff, and even the restaurateur. However, the menu left a bit to be desired. While the food isn't bad, it's simply not classed as highly as the restaurant presents itself. In fact, several menu items are quite bland when compared to what should be contemporarily offered. Additionally, this undesirably highlights certain aspects (too heavy, too salty, clumpy cream sauce, etc.) - these should not be concerns for good Italian food, but at this place they can be. There's no reason why this cannot be a five star establishment, but that can happen once they've considerably and appropriately 'tweaked' their menu."}
{"text":"I asked for the tuna as it was the catch of the day and ended up getting better than I was expecting. Perfectly sized and well accompanied by vegetables and the right amount of potatoes. Ask for a salad as an appetizer"}
