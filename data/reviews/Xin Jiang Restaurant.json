{"text":"Been here a couple of times so far. Very impressed with the variety and the flavors. The bit takes some time to prepare, but it's worth it. Try their beef and onion roll or the diced noodles with lamb. Very yummy. Prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Lamb skew was great. Today they have special. If you are not afraid of hot food, this restaurant is for you."}
{"text":"Very tasty Western Chinese food. I've been there a couple of times now and found everything delicious. I highly recommend the lamb skewers, which are very tender and so delicious. The cold, smashed eggplant dish was very good, as were the thick noodle dishes. The BBQd cabbage was nicely spiced. We also had the Western Chinese naan... I wish they served beer to accompany it. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Overall, I am happy there, food is delicious, the restaurant was clean and etc. Love the bbq lamb, simply, it is good. Don't like some of its rice dishes, too much rice that is under cooked or not tasty. But I will go again."}
{"text":"This place was EXCELLENT!    I had the pleasure of eating here when I went to visit friends in Toronto. I was a bit skeptical when my friend told me about this restaurant, but she's a great cook herself (and Chinese from N. China) so I trust her choice.  The food was so good! I've never had Xinjiang food, but I am sure you'd be hard pressed to find a Xinjiang restaurant just as good even in China.  I had the lamb skewers (since I don't eat beef), then went for seconds. I also had the egg plant, noodles and lettuce wrapped chopped lamb (!?). The spices were amazingly tasty (and not too spicy imo). I apologize for the lack of details but due to many circumstances I wasn't able to review this until 2 months after I went there.   I'll just say that, as a foodie, I've become very picky with food. But after having dinner there once, I kept on nagging my friends to go back that same week (I was only there for a week) and they live 2.5 hours away!"}
{"text":"So was trying to go to JT Mix (another place in the same area) but found out that they have shut down. Ah well wandered around and found this place. Ordered a few items such as lamb skewers, rolled onion pancake with sliced beef and lamb dumplings. While the pancakes were at best average the lamb skewers were AWESOME. They are authentic and they taste amazing. Someone earlier reviewed that it was too much spice and it was trying to cover up something but that is definitely NOT true. These lamb skewers tasted just like the one's in China. I would probably be happy just coming here and having 10 of these.   The service was at first a bit strange (as soon as you finish something they wisk away the plates and stuff, could be quite annoying at times if you approach it from a Western perspective). However what they do is very similar to what happens if you go to a restaurant in China.  4/5, can't give full marks because of the pancakes :P"}
{"text":"The grilled kebabs are too die for however the restaurant suffers from severe consistency issues. I've never had a Bad meal however it's been between great and decent. The soups, noodles and gong bao chicken is good. Their pork dishes are lackluster but always go for the lamb!"}
{"text":"We only had an order to-go an afternoon for lunch. It was fantastic: Western Chinese Style Lamb in Rice. We tried to come back for dinner another night but it was jam-packed and there was a line up; must be some really good stuff we have yet to taste ;)"}
{"text":"Y'all, this place is so good. SO GOOD. Nice and clean, piping hot food, super delicious. Their menus were new and clean and not sticky like other chinese restaurants always have it. This restaurant really just is a few many steps above other chinese restaurants. Also their lamb skewers are a bit small but they're probably the tastiest I've ever had. The flavours were really unique and authentic. Don't come here if you are on a diet (like me), it will be a mistake ."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant for their lamb skewers! Very tasty ! The beef tendon skewer is good too.  Come here if you want some spicy dishes, I highly recommend the spicy seafood dishes."}
{"text":"Make sure you get the skewers. They are amazing. A lot of my friends are generally turned off by lamb because of that after taste however, that after taste does not exist in this restaurant! Everything else is good too though the spice might be too much for some.  Tip: ask for a less spicy meal to start."}
{"text":"Xin Jiang, oh how you make my tummy sing. Although I can't vouch for it's authenticity it truly is something different from the regular Chinese food. As the first poster explained where Xinjiang is, the food does have an Islamic influence in it.  A lot of lamb dishes can be found on their menu. Their lamb skewers at $1.60 a skewer is grilled just right with a bit of tenderness and the right amount of spice. I normally don't like beef tendon but having a skewer here changed my mind on tendon. Absolutely delicious! Their hand-made noodles (a staple with Xinjiang cuisine) with fried chicken was delightful, so was their pineapple fried chicken, fried chicken dumplings and steam lamb dumplings. Their wintermelon soup was really good, you can taste the well prepared stock, save it for the end of your meal, it will soothe your tastebuds.   Ever since my friend introduced me to this place, I've been back twice. A word of caution, whatever you order, DO NOT order their Chinese-Western naan. We had it and it was basically a pizza crust with no toppings. Trust me! unless you enjoy pizza crust. We were looking for a rice dish to please everyone's palette so we went safe and ordered the Chinese staple: Yangchow fried rice (shrimp and bbq pork), to our surprise they used chopped hot dogs in place of the bbq pork! That was one WTF moment. Despite those two dishes, the rest of the food we ordered were great. They have a massive menu, enough choices to please everyone at your table. Like many Chinese restaurants in the area, you get a lot of food for an affordable price, we ended paying just under $20 per person."}
{"text":"I just had lunch over there and tried three dishes. All were good but my favorites were Lamb meat mixed with eggplant and chili papper over rice also shish lamb meat was very decent. Good place to have lunch."}
{"text":"Lamb/wing/tendon skewers, hand pulled noodles, dumplings, green onion pancakes.....  Oh my how this place rules!   I haven't made a review in a while so what better way to kick start things with a 5-star smorgasbord of delectable delights!   I was introduced to this place by Tony and initially I was a bit hesitant because this restaurant prides itself on its lamb dishes and I detest lamb very much.  It's the smell and taste I can't handle.  Some people would classify this as \"gamey\" but to me, it tastes like plastic.  Don't ask my why I associate plastic with it because I haven't tasted plastic itself but it just induces that taste in me.  I'm sorry if I offended you lamb lovers with my comments and acknowledge that taste is subjective obviously!  Anyways, I still gave it a shot because you need to be open minded in order to try new things and boy am I happy that I did.  I'm going to forgo my traditional review structure and just highlight some dishes: (one thing to note is that most of the dishes can be a bit spicy so just tell the waitress to go mild if you can't handle it)  Skewers: Lamb or Tendon or Chicken wing? So many choices...well, get them all! Each skewer comes with about 4-5 pieces.  Chicken wings come in 3 and are HUGE.  Hand Pulled Noodles: Do you know hand pulled noodles? Do you really? \"You don't even know!\" (Dane Cook) These are the characteristics of a successful hand pulled noodle. a. inconsistent thickness  b. a bit chewy  That's what the noodles here are like and I love it.  It's really hard to find good hand pulled noodles in the city because it's labour intensive, but the end product is worth it! So right now, this place has the BEST hand pulled noodles in the city.  I just recently came back from China and they are almost on par.  Dumplings, pancakes, etc. Most of you should be familiar with Shanghainese food.   Well the usual menu items are available but so much better then places like Asian Legend without a doubt.   To Conclude: Get off your butt and cruise/bus/run (you might want to run to justify the grease and carbs:P) on over to this place.  Ironically, it's in the same plaza as Asian Legend. Competition? If you think China (Xin Jiang) vs. Canada (Asian Legend) in ping pong is competition =P  p.s. the lamb was awesome.  Tasted and smelt nothing like it as it was seasoned well!  p.p.s. I did not mean to personally attack Asian Legend btw:P  Just needed to give a base-line for people to compare to since it's such a popular restaurant."}
{"text":"Just went here a few weeks ago and damn their kabobs are good! service as always was great!"}
{"text":"PROS:  -authentic regional cuisine -Hand made noodles with lamb, garlic shoots, vegetables was great. Worth it just for this, especially since it has so much of what this cuisine is known for on one plate. -lamb and fennel dumplings fantastic -sweet pumpkin pancakes- great -garlic eggplant mash also great -Jellyfish salad ok but I've had much better jellyfish dishes elsewhere -service was relatively friendly  The food here is consistently very good especially if you know what to order  4/5"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Loving it so much decided to get a membership. XD Dish to order every visit - da pan ji. Chicken with bones... And lamb kabob"}
{"text":"While still good this place has fallen off my list of \"must eat whenever within radar distance\". They have new kitchen staff and half the front of house wait staff has changed. Their menu was updated a few months ago and removed some delicious stand-bys and replaced them with new flavors that are oilier and less flavorful.   For a while the quality of food was sustaining a 2am closing time every night, but now that has been trimmed back to midnight most nights, earlier when business is slow by 11pm.  Take-out orders are invariably missing something these days (a bowl of rice, and order of bread, a beverage) and there is a rain of scatter-brained-ness about the place. Still more hit than miss but I hit less often."}
{"text":"Very busy restaurant located within a plaza filled with other chinese restaurants and food courts.  Had to wait 15 mins for a takeout order of 4 lamb skewers (2.50 each). They were very tasty, had a bbqd taste, well-seasoned. The meat was very soft and had good fat content. I will return for a snack again!"}
{"text":"The worst xinjiang food I had in Toronto. I went there three years ago and hated the food. After three years I gave it another shot, the xinjiang signature rice is really disappointing. Won't ever go there again."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this review nice and short:  The Good: 1. Lamb Skewers - Not overly gamy and large portions 2. One bowl of rice = Two bowls of rice 3. Exceptional Service - Waiter gave us realistic view of how much to order 4. Good variety of spicy food & so many LAMB dishes!  The Bad: 1. Dirty & Sticky table, the floor was a little oily 2. Wipe down the utensils with hot tea before use 3. Skewer handles were very oily  Will think about returning if they kept the place cleaner."}
{"text":"Their food is always so tasty and flavourful. Only difficulty I find is majority of the staff only speaks Mandarin. They do have an English translation menu, however, if you're asking for something particular, English may be a problem. Speaking in Cantonese they'd understand however, I didn't understand a word what they were saying when they replied back. Other than the language barrier, food is a bomb. They have a lot of spicy food options."}
{"text":"Things you've got to try: Handmade noodles with tomatoes, peppers and lamb. Lamb skewers with cumin. Lamb dumplings.  The food is great and different from typical Chinese fare.  Xin Jiang is an area in China with a distinct style of cuisine - most notable for their lamb skewers with cumin."}
{"text":"Delicious food, haven't gone wrong here yet. I love their skewers -- they make them with a lot of spice, giving them a lot of flavor. The portions on the skewers are also very generous. Their noodles are some of the tastiest, freshest noodles I've had (they are homemade!). I also love their seafood dishes, especially their fish. Last time I was here it was a weekday evening and not busy at all. We received lots of good recommendations by the waitress, and we were on our way with delicious food very quickly! Definitely recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The lamb skewers are tender, juicy and cooked to perfection. The taste of the meat is delightfully soft. The onions sweet aftertaste is a wonderful contrast to the beefs rich spices. The prices are relatively in the steeper side but well worth every penny."}
{"text":"I was at the private grand opening of this restaurants years ago, and I've been a occasional but steady customer since.  And not just because I know the owners..  Xin Jiang is a Muslim territory in China, so there's no swine.  Some people may be surprised that China has a Muslim territory, but in fact Islam is the second largest religion in China, and it was there way before Communism.    I never understood the concept of hanging rugs on the walls, I think rugs belong on the floor, because regardless the intricacy of the design, it's still carpet..and carpet is for walking on.  So the décor of this restaurant isn't anything quite impressive.  You may however be intrigued by the trophies and photographs of Athletes the owner has accumulated over his professional basketball career back in China proudly displayed by the entrance.  The owner's wife also used to be a professional athlete for China's volleyball team, the couple's combined height is just below what Toronto would charge for a 'sky tax'.   I used to help him coach basketball, and this guy did not miss a 3 pointer...EVER!  I love the food here, the lamb kabobs are delicious, and it is probably the restaurant's best seller.  I did try a dish which I loved during the grand opening, but I didn't remember the name.  So each time coming here, I've tried to explain that dish to the owner, the wait staff, and ended up getting the wrong thing every time.  I know they make it, I just don't know what I'm talking about, and neither does anyone who works here.  The menu is meat oriented and with a lot of spice, you'd expect a patronage of young adults, but the people who frequent here are surprisingly of a more civilised generation.    Like all Sino-Islamic restaurants, the menu is short on photos of their food, which always makes for a complicated ordering process...at least for me.  The kabobs are good, but at the price which it is sold, it adds up quickly.  A well managed place, clean, and good food..but I have one complaint;   Despite having a good relationship with the owner, the guy ONLY gives me a discount if I come here with a beautiful woman.    WHY?!"}
{"text":"We usually have a great dinner here. The lam kabobs is very nice fresh and juicy. Jest $1.99/each. And the homemade noodles with lam and tomatoes so good.  The place nice clean . The lady service very great and nice friendly!"}
{"text":"Lauren M. and Tony F. wrote much better reviews on our dining experience at this place so I'm going to suggest your check their reviews out.  My two cents on Xin Jiang Restaurant is what a great job they did with a group of 14 of us. We squeezed nicely around the big round table and the Lazy Susan in the middle made it easy to share everything. Also for $15 a person we had a lot of left over food.   Oh and the box of diapers from the 90's sitting in their kitchen was awesome."}
{"text":"The lamb skewers were pretty good, but they were kind of small compared to other restaurants. I love their beef tendon skewers though. Their lamb and vegetable pot was delicious as well as their Bbq fish.  The lamb dumplings were just okay. The skin was too thick imo. Lamb fried rice was decent.   Downside to this is that they only take cash and not credit cards.   I would come back again no doubt."}
{"text":"My family and I have come here a few times in the past- the food was pretty good, and the service was ok- nothing amazing, but nothing terrible either. The cumin lamb from Backyard garden in the same plaza is more flavourful- we like our food spicy, and the seasonings in the lamb didn't do it for any of us. I did enjoy the handmade noodles and nan.  But this time we had a terrible experience.  The food was mediocre- some of the food came cold... and other dishes tasted canned/ not fresh and the service was extremely slow. We got one dish on average every 30 minutes . Two and a half hours later one of my family members started feeling sick, so we asked if we could cancel our last dish. They told us in a rude tone that \"everyone else was waiting too\"- which is more problematic than a good excuse, and they said that our dish was almost done, which was a lie- we had to wait another 30-40 minutes before our food arrived, and it wasn't a dish that would take so long to cook/ prepare. I don't blame the slow service on the wait staff, but I don' think they handled it properly and were rather dismissive. It was clear that they didn't have enough kitchen staff and that they were cooking single dishes in giant batches. Clearly they valued profit over quality and customer service. Furthermore, we were not given change after we paid.   Also, the prices were a bit high for the value/quality/quantity.  I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"lamb skewers at $2 are really high quality.       they are actually open until 3am !"}
{"text":"The food was good specially the lamb skewers but the service was horrible and the prices were steep for less food. Don't order the soup for they taste like water. The lady also forced us to pay 15% of tip plus the 20$ vip card. You gave them business by coming in to their restaurant to eat and pay for the right price and will scam you by this bs vip card and 15% tip! We are not coming back again for they scam dinners! Your place was not even clean. Very bad customer service!"}
{"text":"Really mediocre food. But it was the service that made me want to review this place. Two of the waitresses look like they're doing you a favour by just merely doing their job. I know I shouldn't expect much service in a restaurant like this, but man do they look miserable - especially the girl with the  lash extensions lol"}
{"text":"We decided to go with everything lamb. The lamb and fennel dumplings are alright. Much of the taste came from the fennel and not the lamb itself. The fennel seemed to overpower the lamb too much. The handmade noodles with lamb + eggplant was really good. Did not realize it would be so spicy but it was still good. The lamb skewers were really good. Rich in flavour and big pieces on a huge skewer. It took a very long time for them to make the skewers though. It came when we finished all our other food. Service is alright. Nothing special. Not very attentive either."}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer for five years now. The lamb skewers are the best you can find in Toronto. A lot of other Chinese BBQ places in Toronto deep fry the lamb skewers before grilling them because it's much faster that way, but the lamb skewers don't taste as good. Xin Jiang Restaurant's lab skewers don't taste like they were deep fried (or maybe they were fried but the restaurant found a way to make them not taste like it). I also love their hand-made noodles. (P.S. Chinese hand-made noodles are a thousand times better than Japanese ramen in my mind. :P) I grew up in Northern China so I like food that tastes heavy, and I find dishes at Xin Jiang Restaurant very satisfying. But if you like light food, this is probably not the right place for you. Also the restaurant is halal."}
{"text":"Loved the noodles with eggplant and lamb (a must-try).  We also tried lamb and beef skewers (very tender and flavourful) and ma-po tofu (which had lots of peppercorn kick and didn't taste like the typical mapo tofu you would expect).  Would definitely go back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I didn't come here for a lunch special.    The regular menu has regular prices and \"VIP\" prices.  That to me is a scam.    Service is terrible.  They don't come to take away plates or to fill tea unless they're actually bringing you a dish.  Sitting at a table in the corner doesn't help either.  I had to go up to the servers to ask for additional dishes, containers, and to pay.  That's 3 times I was doing the job of a server.  The food actually isn't bad, but heavy on the grease.  Out of principle, I would not go back.  I wasn't offered the chance to purchase a VIP card either so that's why I think this place is just a scam.    I don't care if you have photos with famous people. Run a proper restaurant and maybe people will actually come back. Not just because you conned them into buying a VIP card.  Last thing: they don't even take Visa or any other credit cards, just cash or debit at their inflated prices!  Annoying."}
{"text":"Most authentic Xinjiang food in the city, according to my in-laws originally from Xinjiang. We drive up here from the downtown core ALL the time.    They are also Halal and is a good get together place for friends who only eat Halal food."}
{"text":"This is possibly my favorite  place for lamb kebabs (in N America at least). They are really good value too if you have membership (1.5 each).There's a generous amount of meat and its delicious and really juicy.   Most of the other dishes I've tried have been good too. In particular, the dry pot and the lamb noodle dishes are really tasty.   Loses a star because the Spicy Chicken dish that we've  been ordering for a while now has changed in composition over the months, and now consists mainly of potatoes & bones.   Takes debit"}
{"text":"A great takeout meal of lamb and two types of really great fresh, hand-pulled noodles. I found the Chinese beef burger to be dry and forgettable. The lamb skewers were absolutely delicious despite the tiny bit of meat you get, which becomes more obvious with takeout, because it is off the skewer. But it's all quality not quantity, and very yummy, with a nice char and seasoned with a delicious cumin spice mix. But the fresh bouncy noodles are definitely the star here, and the flavors are complex and delicious. Don't be shy about asking for them hot, I found my \"spicy\" noodles to be medium spicy, so no worries things will be too hot. I will definitely be back to try more lamb and noodles, including the Liang pi."}
{"text":"I cannot believe the sharp increase in the price in the last year period. In the beginning it is a very affordable place with nice food. Now I even do not want to renew my membership"}
{"text":"Handmade noodles are really good, however you like it with any meat. Staff are also friendly.  I think this place specializes in lamb. The lamb skewers are $2.50 each but definitely worth it. Seasoned right and grilled very well.  the menu is very diverse and there is a wall of pictures for reference. I'm sure everybody can find something they like here.  Would come back. No credit tho only debit and cash."}
{"text":"Awesome skewers!!! After trying more than 5 bbq places in GTA, finally, I found this authentic one. This is def my go to place for skewers. Highly recommend the signature lamb skewers."}
{"text":"I was so impressed by the food here... complex flavours, the perfect amount of spice, and fresh ingredients.  The service was quite good as well, particularly since the place was full and we were a table of 14. The food came out quick and hot.  Best:  - Lamb and chicken kebabs: perfectly cooked and cuminy, without being overbearingly so. I could have eaten nothing but these things and been happy. - Eggplant: soft and perfect. I don't even have a photo of it because I wanted to get into it so quickly. - Deep fried naan bread and lamb: For some reason, Shari and thought the deep fried naan cubes were some kind of veggie. I thought that they had somehow found a way to make veggies ridiculously tasty. No, it was bread. And it's still ridiculously tasty. - Beef rolled up in flat bread: I've never been disappointed by this ever in my life. It was delicious.  Everything else was very very good.  I will definitely return again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing...it's better than your usual chinese... Apparently it's rooted in the middle eastern tradition, so there is no pork (hard to believe for a chinese place) but the kebabs looked so good I pretended not to be a vegetarian for the night and had the chicken (stopped at that, though) and it was so, so good. The soup was very good, but I only had the broth, as there was lamb in it, but even that was so good.  Prices weren't particularly cheap, but nothing ridiculous.    The waiters were really nice, too, and let me practice chinese with them (I know one phrase which I kept repeating)."}
{"text":"The food is ok, but the service is terrible. One of the servers, who I don't know her name( she is not tall but always works at late nite), the service and attitude she offers is the worst I've ever seen. Yesterday we went there and when we paid the bill we found the service charge was already included. We asked her why the tips are included but without telling us. She said it's a new policy in their restaurant and it sounds like it's mandatory for us to pay it. We were so angry and didn't pay the tips ( usually we pay 10% or even more when we eat at restaurants). While we were walking out of restaurant, I and my friend could both hear the complaint from that server to her coworkers with a loud voice. She said\" they should not eat at restaurant, if they can't afford tips.\" That is sooooo rude!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I desperately wanted to love this place, especially since I brought a huge group of my fellow yelpers here.   Having never been here, I knew it was a bit of a risk.    I just recently returned back from China where I discovered the Uyghur Food (known as Xian Jiang, or literally \"New Gingers\"  [[I wonder what Carrot Top would say]]).    The Uyghur are a Turkic ethnic group living in North Western China, and are predominately Muslim so the food is halal.    I immediately fell in love with the food while visiting a few remote regions in China, but also the vast availability of the cuisine in Shanghai and Beijing.  There were so many dishes that hit my palette like a truck.  The lamb, mutton kabobs with this spicy cumin rub, where after they take it off the grill sprinkle it with some more of the rub.  The \"Big Plate of Chicken\" in this soupy spicy broth where they add fresh \"Lai Mein\" or literally Pulled Noodles.  The texture of the noodles were like nothing I've ever had before, it was chewy and silky.  The Naan used to suck up all of the other brothy goodness were light and crispy.  And the Polo which is a meaty rice pilaf that was saucy and tasty.  Unfortunately Xian Jiang had most of these dishes (I was disappointed not to find the Polo) in name, but it was nothing like what I had had back in China.  The kabobs were merely okay, and was probably the highlight of the evening.  The broth in the Big Plate of Chicken was fairly plain, and only consisted of a spicy flavour.  I think the biggest issue for the whole evening was the spicy flavour profile for all the dishes were the same.   The dishes I had in Asia, varied in flavour.  Here, it seemed everything pretty much tasted of the same rub/sauce/marinade.    The noodles, which I was so hoping replicated what I had was definitely not fresh.  It was limp.  Not so silky.  Not so chewy.  The Naan, was thick and had probably been sitting around for a while.    The service was excellent and they were attentive to our large group.   Although in name many of the dishes were present, the food wasn't that bad, but it just wasn't the same.    There are three other Uyghur restaurants in Toronto, and hopefully they come a bit closer to what I had previously experienced, as I am craving an authentic experience."}
{"text":"This is one of those \"hole in the wall\" masterpieces that exist in the Scarborough/South Markham area. The menu boasts it to be a western style asian cuisine, although I'm no expert, I think the proximity to india and other countries to the west explains the extra spice and heat.   This is also one of those places you can't wait to show your friends. The name is a bit tough to remember, but I have been brought here by food friends on two separate occasions without realizing it was this place.  It looks like they have a ton of great dishes to check out, but I can't help getting the two superstar dishes they have: - hand pulled noodles - bbq skewers  The skewers are pretty popular, but they aren't very cheap. They do stand out in terms of flavour - dry rubbed spice and I'm pretty sure charcoal grilled. The standard meat is fantastic, but the Lamb just rocks with their style of cooking.  I most recently went for lunch. It's just $6 for the best Asian style hand pulled noodles I have had, in a ridiculously awesome spicy and tasty sauce. I got the vegetarian option, which is one of the best full on veggie options I've had at an asian place but I have had the lamb, and it was great too. A perfect blend of heat and flavour.  Also worth mentioning: the portions are big! I'm a big eater, so I finished my bowl of noodles and was pleasantly stuffed. You may want to get some skewers and share the noodles.  As in all good asian restaurants, the meal came with free tea, and especially good - complimentary soup. Service is like all good asian places - friendly and quick, but you need to be bold and wave them down.  This is a fantastic place to check out and show your friends!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and it was amazing! We went on a Friday night and it was not busy at all. Service was great and when we asked the waiter to give us some recommendations, he definitely gave us the best tips! We ordered the lamb skewers and the homemade noodles with lamb and tomatoes. Under $20 in total tax and tips included...worth the price!   The lamb skewers were so juicy and succulent. The portion was great for each skewer. I had the mild kabobs and it was so delicious. The meat was very tender and it did not have the weird lamb smell. Usually I don't order lamb because it has a strange, distinct smell that immediately turns off my appetite. But the skewers were perfectly marinated and the smell was delicious.   I also loved the home made noodles. I thought it would be really sour because of the tomatoes, but it turned out perfect. The sauce was amazing, the lamb was tasty and the onions and veggies were perfectly mixed with the noodles. So much flavour and it was a great portion!  Overall, the food was great and service was amazing. Would definitely come here again for their lamb specials. The server recommended us a few more things to try for next time. Great environment and great food. Can't wait for next time!"}
{"text":"Really good (halal) Uyghur style kebabs! Get the membership card - it pays for itself in 2 visits!"}
{"text":"Average in my opinion. Service was a bit cold and unfriendly - but food is decent.   Had the cold noodles, minced lamb wrap, hand pulled lamb noodles and red bean pancake. Compared to other restaurants that serve similar dishes, portions here are on the small and pricey side. I would've given them 4 stars if the servers were friendlier lol."}
{"text":"This is a good joint for when you feel like some spicy skewers. I love spicy food and their spices are quite intense. Especially their szechuan spicy fish fillet in a bowl filled with oil spicy broth. It will make your nose run and if you are fan of that, you'll enjoy it.  I love the chicken skewers here, although most people order their lamb/beef. That's just because I prefer chicken. Also order it with at least a bit of spice.  They have a WIDE selection of unique dishes that I don't find elsewhere... such as the stirfried beef with onion and lotus leaf white buns. You wrap the meat and onion inside the buns and its a dream. The buns are so fresh and softly moist too.  One star deducted because their service can be improved as we had to ask for glasses of water multiple times for the people who couldnt handle the heat."}
{"text":"They're famous for their lamb skewers, but the tofu skewers and the cabbage skewers are also excellent! Skewers, every time. The Chef's signature dishes are always first-rate, and I do not usually stray from those. The braised beef and the lamb with buns are really great. Also the deep fried bread stick with coriander egg roll (dim sum menu) is scrumptious: crunchy, soft and chewy; sweet and bright. I've tried (unsucessfully) to recreate these at home so I buy extras every time I go there (they even taste good the next day, without a re-heat). The cold salads are also excellent and refreshing.  I go there every month or so, and service has always been fine."}
{"text":"Thee place to go for Asian-style lamb skewers.  They normally come spicy but you have the option of asking for non-spicy as well.  It taste a lot better with the spice rub on top.  I would recommend to come here with a group of four to be able to really share and sample their menu without getting too full on any one dish.  Their dumplings here are also excellently done and their menu has a lot of the traditional northern Chinese style cuisine.  Their \"lup lup\" noodle dish is my favourite by far.  It is lamb, veggies, and hand-pulled noodle niblets mixed together.  It is very savoury with the slight acidity of tomatoes that will make you coming back for more.  You can also get their VIP card fro $20.  Good for 2 years.  10% discount on all future visits."}
{"text":"My other reviews still apply. This one is specifically for their 10th anniversary specials. This week, their special is $0.10 lamb skewers, but only 2/person. Yeah. $0.10. Oh happy day!  Promo ends tonight."}
{"text":"Great place with AMAZING food.  I highly recommend the lamb kabobs, the handmade noodles, the beef and onion pancakes, and fennel lamb dumplings. They are a staple every time we come here!  The cabbage kabob sounds plain, and I admit I questioned it when a coworker decided to order them, but man everyone loved them. The blend of spices and seasoning on it was fantastic- lots of cumin and other spices.  I bought the membership card for $20 with my coworkers and we earned back what we paid for it on the first visit with all the savings we got with it. Plus, the membership card lasts for TWO years, not one!"}
{"text":"If you like lamb, this is the place to go. You can order lamb skewers, dumplings, on rice and lamb shoulder.  It may be difficult to communicate as most of the staff speak mainly Mandarin.   On the menu, they have pictures and you can ask the next table on what they ordered. Make sure you tell them the level of spice as they can adjust accordingly if possible. They also advertise their special of the week via an app and also at the restaurant.  However, you need to be able to read Chinese or talk with the staff.  I would definitely recommend people to try them out if you like lamb. I can't wait to return for more lamb especially with this cold weather."}
{"text":"Very tasty dinner.  Ordered toothpick lamb skewers, cumin beef with steamed buns, lamb stirfried pulled noodle, eggplant lamb rice in wooden tub and stirfried veggies.  Meat dishes were good but came with lots of onions.  Next time will probably go back to long lamb skewers since u get more meat.  We always love their homemade noodles.  Can't avoid grease though with stirfried noodles.  The eggplant lamb rice dish is always our favorite especially when it's offered at a deep discount on the weekday lunch menu.  Portion can feed 3.    Service was efficient and food came fast.  What really surprised us was the wokhay at a western chinese restaurant.  U can taste the smokiness in the veggies and the noodles.  Will definitely go back again.  Love all the varied offerings on the lunch menu.  Too bad i think only avail on weekdays."}
{"text":"mediocre, definitely not amazing.  since there's a good amount of positive reviews about the lamb skewers, i decided to come by today. It was NOT as good as i was expecting. it wasn't cumin-y enough or spicy enough. After having hakka food and si-chuan food, i feel that the amount of spice and flavor was just not up to far in this place.  I did like the house hand made noodle in lamb soup. it was tomato-y and delish.   backyard garden next door has better cumin lamb and lamb skewers.   kind of expensive for this type of food. probably wont visit again."}
{"text":"Its actually my first time trying food from this part of China and I was pleasantly delighted with the food. We got the stir fry beef noodle for $12.99 and it was delicious. The noodles are hand made and it was thick and chewy. The sauce was spicy and sour, super tasty. Then we got the lamb soup for $13.99 and it was quite refreshing. Im not a big fan of lamb but I was able to eat it and it didnt have that flavour. Then we got the fish skewer for 2 for 4.49$ and it was so so so good. The fish was huge and so fresh and grilled to perfection. The lamb skewer which was 1 for $4.49 I think was not good. That had a super lamb taste which I cant stand. Service was fast but the waitress was quite rude. All our other dishes came except for the lamb skewer so we asked the waiter if they missed our order cuz even our fish skewer came. He didnt understand english so the waitress came and talked really fast so I said pardon, then she got pissed and left. Iunno what happened there, maybe its miscommunication. All in all food was 4/5 and service was 2/5. Other than the waitress everyone else was alright."}
{"text":"Really authentic Chinese food; go here for their freshly grilled BBQ skewers. They are REALLY tasty!  I got a variety of skewers (the lamb was really good), plus other dishes such as rice noodles and fried dough with filling. The food comes fast, and prices are reasonable.  Totally satisfies a craving for bbq'd skewer meat!"}
{"text":"Long wait times, noisy and often poor customer service but still 4 star!...yeah I loved the food that much that I forgot everything and even got a membership.   Their bbq menu is a must try and any spicy stirfry will be heavenly if you can take the heat. It is my favourite chinese restaurant now. Most bad reviews had to do with late service or heat, I don't mind small mistakes or late service if the food compensates."}
{"text":"Authentic xinjiang food, hands down the best in the city. Flavourful and hearty guaranteed to fill you up."}
{"text":"I love this place for xin jiang style cumin lamb skewers ! My usuals are lamb and beef tendon skewers, beef pancake roll, and noodles. If I come in a larger group, I would get the braised lamb on naan. I absolutely love their lamb dishes here. They have a full menu page dedicated to lamb dishes and I just love it. If you love lamb, do come here.   The service is quick even though there may be a wait during dinner times on the weekend. Great place for cumin lamb skewers and spicy dishes."}
{"text":"Nice traditional Xinjiang food! And a lot of deals at lunch time. Almost wanted to try out this place."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 14 (!!) Even with this many people, we barely managed to put a dent at trying everything on the menu, lots of choices.   Still, we did manage to try a large number of dishes, most of which I cannot remember the name of.  We ordered both lamb and chicken skewers (think they cost $1.75 each). These were fairly tasty, but not really overly delicious. The meat was cooked well (not overcooked) and had a cumin spice mix rubbed on top. I thought they needed a bit of saltiness.  We also tried a few veg dishes (broiled eggplant, green beans and bok choy), a HUGE dish called \"big plate of chicken\" that was served with noodles, one with a naan bread \"pizza\" base topped with slow-cooked lamb and another lamb dish served with a dry rub on the side.  Most of these dishes were good but nothing special. I would give the naan bread dishes a pass next time as the bread itself was kind of horrible. Most of the dishes were quite spicy but every dish we had seemed to have the exact same flavour as the others.  Strangely enough, the star dish of the show was something we couldn't quite remember ordering. We thought it was fried cubes of some kind of root vegetable mixed with some other veggies, but we realized after that it was actually \"deep fried naan bread\". Hilarious...but very tasty.  The service here was excellent....considering we had a table of 14 people and the rest of the restaurant was packed, our dishes came out quickly and we were well taken care of.  Would probably go back if this was closer to go home."}
{"text":"Really nice clean restaurant, with great food and decent service.  Tried the lamb skewers and theyre the way I enjoy with lots of meat and cumin and minimal fatty pieces. I would come back for these but pricey at $2.50 for one.  Also tried a chili oil fish. So much chili you would never know there's a fish underneath. A little spicy for me but I still enjoyed the soft fish underneath.  Overall would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Love the lamb skewers. Love how it came on the metal sticks. I like them with extra cumin and spice powder. This place has been around since forever ago. I used to crave it all the time. So many skewer places have popped out since then, but a lot of these places fry the lamb skewers instead of the authentic bbq over charcoal technique. Revising this place brought back lots of memories. Quality did not deteriorate over all these years and price remain reasonable."}
{"text":"Xinjiang is China's north western province and is home to China's second largest Muslim chinese minority population (8.4 million people), the Uyghurs.  The province is known for its picturesque landscapes but my favourite part is the cuisine influenced from its central Asia neighbours and position on the Silk Road.   When I was living in China, I would go for xingjiang food all the time quickly developing a craving for its noodle dishes, lamb kabobs and spices. Back in Toronto, I was wondering how I would get my fix. To my surprise, while dining at one of the Asian Legend outlets on Steeles, I found Xin Jiang Restaurant and was in heaven at first bite.  Despite the fact that there are some sichuan, and other non xinjiang dishes mixed into the extensive menu, it is as close to the real deal as you're going to get here.  The menu is written in both English and Chinese so it is easy for newcomers to xinjiang food to decipher what they are selecting. The cuisine is known for its lamb dishes, nan bread, kabobs and pulled noodles.   In addition to everything i just mentioned, one of my favourite dishes, however is the braised eggplant with green peppers.  Cash or debit only. Go try it! Best to go with a group of people and share lots of dishes because it is impossible to only order a dish or two once you see them coming out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"A great place for lamb skewers. They make it perfectly here, the right amount of char and spice on the outside of each morsel of moist juicy meat. Each skewer comes with four sizeable chunks of lamb on a metal skewer. It takes a bit of finessing to wrangle each piece off the skewer, but its well worth the effort. The spinach and vermicelli salad is a great counterpart to the heavier dishes, which is pretty much any meat dish you may get). It contains more garlic and vinegar than the usual, but it works perfectly in this environment.  The service is fast paced and speaks predominantly Mandarin. I can see how not knowing the language may detract from the experience, but luckily all the menu options comes with rough translations and a lot of pictures. You can definitely get by with just English and a little patience."}
{"text":"I am mostly commenting on the wait time here. We really had high hopes for this place after reading all of the reviews. We came on a Friday, maybe around 7PM I think.  The place was already very packed but we were seated right away. We ordered lamb skewers since it was the most recommended dish on Yelp. We also ordered a fish dish that was large enough for two people.  It took almost half an hour to get the lamb skewers and the main dish came out at around 50 minutes from us placing the order. There were also other customers who were becoming irate waiting for their pickup orders as well.  The lamb was definitely good but not way better than at other Chinese restaurants. Tiger BBQ also has really good lamb skewers. The fish dish was alright as well but not worth that wait time.  I don't know if it was an off day for the kitchen that day but we won't go back with that type of wait time."}
{"text":"I would say only come to Xin Jiang Restaurant for their skewers as that is the only thing that's worth the price and tastes better than many other similar restaurants.   Environment: The restaurant is located at the Metro Square Plaza (Steeles/Ferrier) and parking has always been an issue at this plaza. Be alert and be on the lookout for careless drivers as well. Save yourself the trouble and try to stay away from the main parking space near the restaurants and go for the parking spots at the back to save on time spent looking and stay away from reckless drivers.  For the restaurant itself, I find that it's very loud, the atmosphere felt greasy and sort of stink of BBQ, so it's probably not a good idea to wear anything fancy/expensive that you mind getting dirty there. There were a decent number of tables and they have large round tables for big groups of 10.  Food: First thing first, when you first take a look at the menu, you'll notice there are 2 prices, one for VIP and one for regular. I think in general the VIP pricing is $1-3 cheaper per dish. In order to get the VIP pricing, you have to purchase a VIP card for $20 which lasts for 2 years. It's pretty worth it in my opinion as you can basically get your money back after 2 visits. This is actually a pretty good business trick, just make the regular prices higher and have the customers purchase the VIP card to make them feel good about getting the savings. But yeah, the regular price is too expensive for what you're getting. Onto the food, we actually ordered a bunch of stuff, such as lamb skewers, lamb with rice, cold tofu with preserved eggs, stretched noodle with lamb, and seafood with rice crispy. I didn't come from Northern China so I can't comment on the authenticity of the dishes, but just flavour wise the only thing I liked a lot were the lamb skewers, and the rest was just alright. One thing is sure though, everything felt really dry and greasy, so I couldn't stop drinking the tea. Also, I find that the portions are not as big as Southern Chinese/HK restaurants and there were a lot of meats in the dish.  Not sure if I'll come back again for another visit, since I wasn't the one who bought the VIP card and their regular prices are a little pricey."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch special (weekdays before 5pm, excluding holidays). It's a really good deal as quite a few of their regular menu items are about $2-3 cheaper, around $6-7 for most dishes. Their regular menu has a normal price and a VIP price in red, the VIP card is $20 and last for 2 years. It's worth it if you like the restaurant and the food because the VIP prices are about $2 cheaper per dish.  Ordered 6 dishes from the lunch special menu, the lamb soup was good, strong lamb flavour but a bit over salted - goes well with the green onion pancake that comes with the soup. The hand pulled noodles are fantastic, ordered the lamb and vegetable and the lamb with shredded potato, both are good - a bit greasy and salty, but to be expected. The seafood fried rice was forgettable, it was a good flavour but mild in comparison to the other dishes, huge portions though. The cumin chicken fried rice had a strong cumin flavour and it was unexpectedly good. The lamb and fennel dumplings were good, but not the main attraction for coming here (if I was looking for dumplings I'd probably go to dumpling house next door). All in all a good meal and would come back, great service from our server too, though it can be hit or miss here."}
{"text":"Lamb skewers at $1.50/skewer with a $20 VIP card. A bit of a joke, non-VIP customers pay $2.50/ skewer but get more lamb pieces on their skewers.  A discount for less food!  Wings on skewers are better. Tofu on skewers were rotten masked by the spices they use.  Taste is good....don't bother with the BS VIP card.  Cash-only restaurant.  Not good for society in the long run if businesses don't pay taxes."}
{"text":"A return visit this afternoon for lunch.  The hand pulled noodles with lamb and garlic bolt as delicious as ever.  A new dish for us that was a real winner: pan fried eggplant with chile, the chiles were green hot and sweet, made for a scrumptious combination with the smokiness softness of the eggplant.  We also had Szechwan style fish in soup as a new dish, and lovely tofu and greens dumplings, shaped like little valises.  I will attempt to load photos of the latter two.   Xin Jiang remains one of the more unusual, authentic regional chinese restos in the east end. Top of my list.  The lovely Amy, again, made sure we ordered well and felt taken care of."}
{"text":"our favorite go-to place for spicy food. we always always always get spicy lamb and tofu skewers, the spicy potato salad and the spicy chicken cartilage! their rice in wooden pots are also delicious!  aside from all their good food; people are always helpful and service is quick. absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"Xinjiang is a province in Northwestern China that is predominantly populated by the Hui minority (muslims). Thus their food has a mix of Chinese and Muslim influences.  This is one of the few places in Toronto serving this kind of cuisine - as I walked in I could smell the cumin-y goodness that reminded me of Xi'an's muslim quarter. Came here with my parents and Gr!andma, who remarked how clean this place looked, a top priority when she is dining out. It was quite packed with Chinese people of all ages.   We ordered the La Mian (pulled noodles) with potatoes, so not the soup based one, lamb and beef tendon skewers, stir fried veg, and the lamb and fennel dumplings. Next time I'd like to lrder the soup based noodles instead, I feel like that would be better. The skewers were great and had a lot of spices, you can even order less spicy if you have dining partners that can't take spice (akthough they'll miss out for sure!). The dumplings were great and had a lot of fennel, which for me is not a bad thing. The veg were your typical garlicky oily stir fried veg.   Value wise it may be a little pricier than other restaurants in the plaza, but their cuisine is a bit harder to find in Toronto"}
{"text":"I've been here many times before, but today we can for their $11.99 lamp chop special. The flavour was great, very tender and crispy, and large portion. We have a VIP membership and it is well worth it for other things on the menu as well."}
{"text":"We're visiting family in Toronto and tried this restaurant. It is amazing!! My husband is always looking for good food and this is his favorite place in all of Toronto. The restaurant has a membership you can buy to save money on each dish purchased. We wished we purchased that. We're back for a second visit during our trip. It's that good!"}
{"text":"I read the glowing reviews for this place and was really looking forward to it. As soon as we got there, it smelled really good so I got really excited..  Then the beef tendon skewers came. Tendon? I doubt it. more like grilled chunks of pure animal fat (which were flavourless btw). That was enough to kill if for me. That and the fact they messed up my order (i tried to get that shredded lamb and pancakes dish and they brought out some microscopic pieces on toothpicks instead - not only awkward to eat but subsequently awkward to digest!)  The service wasn't particularly great either. they completely forgot about the last dish we ordered. We had to politely remind them to bring us our final heart attack on a plate. The food there is WAY too oily. The crispy beef is heavily deep fried chunks of beef with no flavor.  The only saving grace was a lamb noodle dish with a tomato garlic and onion sauce (You really do kinda see where the italians ripped it off from). An island of goodness in an otherwise sea of greasy terror.  For all my criticism and negativity, I will say that I can see how if you go into the place, know exactly what's good, and what to order, you might actually really like it. The ridiculously large menu doesn't help a newb to the regional cuisine. In either case, be prepared to live a shorter life for your visit!"}
{"text":"We had (1) beef with stir fry pancake bread  (2) bean cold noodle - a staple wherever I go (3) the special lamb tripe stir fry (4) mild lamb with noodle. It was all delicious. There is a club card that's worth it if you come here three times. I know I'll be back for some lamb skewers and fish which I had no room for."}
{"text":"This place will stink up your whole outfit. Forget about going anywhere after dinner. You need to jump into shower and burn all your clothing to kill this stench. It's strong as curry, and, once you are exposed in it, you will grow to love. However for the love of everyone else in town, please go straight home. Because of the smell, you know you stumbled upon on some real Chinese Turk restaurant.  I'm okay with their food. Maybe I'm not that much of a fan for Chinese Turk food other than the skewers. It's a good exp to eat here once in a while. I haven't found anything on the menu that's my fave. More than half of their menu is just normal Chinese restaurant food you can find anywhere else."}
{"text":"If you love Chinese food and want to try some new-to-you dishes, don't miss out on Xin Jiang Restaurant. The decor and service in this strip mall spot are far from fancy, but the food is wonderful. We've rented a car and driven out to Markham from downtown just to eat here before, it's that good. Excellent and clearly labeled vegetarian options, too!   The \"vegetable hand made stir-fried noodles\" are excellent, with that perfect pulled noodle bite and chew. The sauce is perfectly spiced and seasoned, with an excellent assortment of fresh sautéed veggies. Don't miss out on the \"crispy fried sweet yam w/ candy coat\" for dessert, just be sure to dunk as many pieces as possible in the water provided and then leave them on a plate to dry before they become permanently fused. It's a large portion, definitely a great group dessert choice.   There are so many great Chinese places in Markham, but opportunities to enjoy Xinjiang cuisine are relatively rare in Toronto. Give it a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is our new go to restaurant for Western Chinese BBQ!  We came late Friday night... wasn't busy around 11:30pm and they close at 2am.  Skewers are excellent especially the house special lamb skewers which are served on metal skewers.  We also had the shrimp, tofu, beef and cabbage which were all excellent. The marinated cold beef and tripe appetizer dish was outstanding as well as the braised beef brisket.  Next time we will try the dumplings and noodles on the menu. The VIP card is worth it as it's $20 for 2 years and you will save around $1-$3 per dish. The server was a young guy but was very friendly and nice.  The restaurant was very clean and presentable.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"tongue boner."}
{"text":"\"No Tip...Dont come back!!\"  Appalling service even for a Chinese restaurant more to follow.... Good food no doubt  We were the only non Chinese at the restaurant a spectacle among other patrons  Went at 9 pm were greeted by a waiter and led to the table, great welcome as most of such establishments ignore you at the entrance during rush hour(Friday night perhaps.,,Anyways they were out of leg o lamb n skewers the sole purpose of my visit and our waitress suggested we try alternatives i got 1 which  i liked but i still wanted skewers she goes \"same meat u dont eating skewers\" i tend to give people benefit of doubt especially the fresh off the boat kind and dont judge them too harshley Food arrived it was great xin jiang, uyghur  style, our waitress was nice enough to offer my 3 yo high chair at first and after serving food never once visited or made eye contact.... we needed more cutlery  Anyways paid the bill $50.13 for 4 items as we were about to leave she puts the bill in front of my face and says you dont pay tip, we were taken aback said u didn't have the things we wanted she says  dont come back!! And throws our left over in the pile as my wife was packing it for my son, when we demanded to see the manager she goes \"no manager here\" we requested thru other staff a lady sitting in the corner skewering meat and made an effort to help by smiling sorry We were shocked and laughing all the way back home in a \"did that just happen??!!\" State I remember seeing a documentary about how people are enslaved thru trafficking and paid next to nothing when they come here, sorry lady youve got my sympathy but No Tip!!"}
{"text":"oh this location is far better than its sister restaurant (The Only) at midland/Sheppard!  I went to their midland sheppard location first, and happened to come here for a dinner with friends. I was expecting so-so spicy food but with the same disappointments that I experienced @ The Only, but I was pleasantly surprised!  Their skewers and noodle dishes are a must-try"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a weekday so I got to order from their special lunch menu. Most dishes were priced at $6.99 which I thought was a steal until I actually got the food. We ordered the beef fried rice and lamb with eggplant rice but we pretty much got a whole lot of rice and not much of meat. I guess they have to find ways to make a profit at $6.99 some how. I also found the food to be more on the greasy side. That aside, the taste was quite good.   The other reason why I only gave it a 3 star is because of one server.  We were served by this really rude guy who looked like he was miserable at his job and acted like he was too good for it.  He mess up on our order but denied it was his fault.  The lamb eggplant with rice came out within the 5 mins while we waited 30 mins for the beef fried rice. We had to asked for it twice!  The second time, I also asked if he forgot to put the order in, he said in a very condescending tone, \"If I didn't put your order in, how would you have gotten your lamb eggplant rice\" and the just walked away.  W.T.F?!!?!!!   Not sure if I will be back in a jiffy."}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of this place when they opened and had a promotion with lamb skewers. I loved all the dishes so much that my family got their annual VIP card and continued to come back within that year. After about half a year of frequent visits with my family, about 6-7 times, we noticed the significant reduction in the size and amount of meats we get in the dishes, whether it be the skewers or stirfried meats. The taste of the dishes also doesn't taste as good anymore, and a plate of stirfried pepper beef would have mostly peppers than beef. I suspect the main famous chef whose photos are displayed at the front was only working and managing the back during the early openings of the restaurant and for cost saving reasons they switched to lesser chefs that simply copy some of the dishes in looks but not so much in taste."}
{"text":"Found this gem in yelp, was in the area looking for a place to eat. After reading reviews after reviews, I knew we had to try. It isn't much to see storefront and interior. My guess is that they were going for authenticity as decors were very simple, almost like the ones you see in food joints amongst Mongolia or Northern China.  The food however was unexpectedly very delicious. The reviews prodded me to order the Lamb skewers as it was present in every single review that I read. I am not a big fan of Lamb Skewers but these guys knew how to make me love it enough to make me order it twice ! . The meat was very juicy and tender void of any unsavoury smell lambs are known for . Seasoned with just the right amount of cumin and salt. My other new favourite is the Hand Pulled Noodles with Stir Fried Vegetables and choice of meat (we had the lamb). Hubby and I loved it. The taste is uncommon in the GTA's food scene. light tomato based sauce over chewy noodles that bounces on every bite is this noodle lover's pure heaven. Its like eating Bubble Tea Pearls only stir fried and slurpy. I am no great cook, but the onions seemed to bring out the sweetness of the tomatoes for the dish.   Anyhow it wasn't all perfect, I gave a four star rating because the 3rd dish we ordered was a miss. Homestyle Beef Brisket Stew. 1.) Meat was a  bit on the tough side 2. Flavor was a bit off 3.  the most expensive out of the dishes we ordered. Sad to say it was not worth it.   Price wise, its not cheap but not crazy expensive either. Servers were nice and accommodating.  I saw tables ordered the BBQ Cabbage, shredded Potatoes dish and dumplings. Cant wait to come back to try those."}
{"text":"My Asian friends that I ate with really liked it. I thought it was ok. I guess the chef is racist? Just kidding.   Good food but not my cup of tea. If you like this sort of somewhat spicy food, then try it out."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5 This place is located at Metro Square at Warden Ave and Steeles Ave E. There were ample parking spaces at the plaza.   [SERVICE] - 4/5 Most of the servers spoke Mandarin. It was a little difficult to communicate with some of them but we mainly spoke with one server who was fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese, and English. He was very friendly and answered all our questions.    [DÉCOR] - 2/5  Tables were wobbly and and chairs felt kind of sticky and not that clean.   [QUALITY] - 2/5 Below average. I felt like they used a lot of spice to cover up the lack of freshness in the ingredients.   [ORDER] - 2/5 - Stir-Fried Green Beans (Spicy): green beans were dry and spicy. This is probably the traditional style to prepare green beans in Xi Yu (region in Northwest China), but I just prefer the Southern Chinese style of this dish with fresher and juicier green beans.   - Sweet Pumpkin with Salted Egg Yolk: the highlight of the meal! Sweet but lightly dusted with savoury dried egg yolk powder. I know it sounds weird, but trust me, it tastes really good!   - Noodles with Lamb: noodles were oily and flavours of the lamb were masked by mouth-numbing spices   - Chicken, Lamb, and Chicken Heart Skewers: meat was not tender but spices went well with the skewers   - Rack of Lamb: this dish was slightly fresher than the other dishes and tasted tender meaty, and spicy.   [OVERALL] - 2/5 The only good dish was the Sweet Pumpkin with Salted Egg Yolk. Unfortunately, I would not recommend the other items because the spices were not aromatic and did not enhance the flavours of the food. Instead, it masked the lack of freshness of (or lack thereof) the ingredients."}
{"text":"Lamb is awesome here. The spice is a little strong after too many skewers but some other can eat 4 or more and still keep going.  A little pricey for me I think since there are WAY too many asian choices around but if you are craving for some really good spiced lamb then give it a try. Just a note the skewers take some time so order that first if going for lunch."}
{"text":"Before I came here, friends told me service is very bad, I told them I don't mind, as long as the food is good, but after I got here with my kids, I realized service really horrible, not worth it"}
{"text":"I was craving some lamb skewers from a restaurant that specializes this and found this on Yelp. I decided to give this place a try for their fairly high ratings.   And yes, I would give it 4/5 just like what I saw! We ordered the lamb skewers ($2.50 each), cabbage skewers, cold eggplant and the egg with dough stick.   They were all very yummy dishes. The seasoning was all spicy but not too hot. I thought that the lamb skewers were a bit expensive especially if you don't have a membership. It was still pretty tasty and much better than what you get at the night market!"}
{"text":"My favourite place to grab lamb skewers. Their other BBQ options are good too, but the lamb is tops.   They close at 3am so it's a good place to relax after a long day at work. Definitely check it out if you're in the area or get cravings for skewers."}
{"text":"Delicious food, both locations are fantastic. Very authentic style Xinjiang cuisine! :-)"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here, he actually wanted to try out this restaurant so we went and ordered two dishes. I am not a super big fan of spicy items, but this restaurant made me love spicy food. Defraud to come on a little bit slow, and the food itself wasn't very cheap, but overall, it was alright"}
{"text":"Debating between this restaurant or the one right next to it with the same menu, we decided to try this one following a friend's appraisal. I automatically noticed they have a small patio with a few benches set up that would definitely bring me back in the summer time. Looking at based on their menu, selection is wide.. but aside from skewers, most dishes are pretty big, family style. Here are just a few things I ordered that swept my feet away.. 1)mushroom skewers: coming with only 5 pieces per order, i suggest you should at least order 2 per person.. You'd crave for more. The mushrooms are just regular button mushrooms, but they use salt and a few seasoning that really brought out the taste. Be careful when you bite into it, JUICYNESS ALERT! the mushrooms are my fav thing on the menu and its the one thing that keeps choosing Xin Jiang over Yang's BBQ over at Midland and Finch 2)  lamb skewers:  as a northern chinese cuisine restaurant majoring in skewers, lamb skewers are the back bone, and the one thing that would determine whether the restaurant is good or not. The lamb skewers goes for $2 per skewer (a little pricier than average), you get what you pay for. The pieces are defintely chunkier than average 3) grilled corn: For 2.99/order we were expecting a little more than ONE piece of corn cut into 3... i mean for an asian restaurant I was expecting quantity over quality. The corn lacks both. It wasnt buttered or seasoned,just straight up roasted corn.  4) beef skewer: overly dry. it might as well be beef jerky on a skewer. 5) frog legs : for the adventurous ones! This is the only place I ever came across that serves frog legs so I don't have any other experience to compare it to. It gave me a pretty good impression, the spicy sauce they spread over the legs while they grilled it masks any taste that wouldve grossed me out. The texture was quite rubbery.. If you have never tasted it and looking for a great first experience, give it a try ! I also noticed this place also have very inexpensive pitchers  ($7) plus cheap domestic beer ! Also it's open till 3am for the late night owls!!"}
{"text":"The main reason I wanted to eat at Xin Jiang is because of their famous lamb skewers. But when I saw their lunch specials, I just could not resist!  Over 35 items around $6 to $7. The huge selection makes choosing what to eat quite difficult as the colourful photos just makes everything looks so delicious. Just be warned even at this bargain pricing, the portion is big enough to fill you up!   The complimentary soup would be something I won't recommend. Yes it is free but I just hated that gluey, starchy texture.  Xinjiang Style Chicken Combo ($6.49) and Hand Made Noodle with Sliced Lamb ($6.99) were both tasty, not overly spicy and with great balanced flavour.   Give Xin Jiang a try especially if you are a lamb lover. I guarantee you won't be disappointed!  So I guess I have to make another trip for the skewers!   Lunch Special is available only on weekdays from 11 am to 5 pm! So plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time over Victoria Day weekend for dinner. It's located in Metro Square plaza. We were a group of 4 and got seated immediately, despite the restaurant being very full. The staff spoke mainly Mandarin and English. Their restaurant area is clean and new, but their washroom isn't great.  Like most skewer restaurants in this area, they have both non-member and VIP member pricing. VIP membership is $20 for 2 years. However, the pricing extends beyond just skewers and applies to all dishes. The savings can actually make a pretty big difference too. For example, one of the noodle dishes we ordered went from $15.99 to $12.99. Lamb skewers went from $2.50 to $1.50 each.  We ordered a round of skewers for all of us, a big plate of fried green beans, and a bowl of handmade noodles with eggplant. The lamb skewers were a bit on the rare side, but still tasted good. The chicken wing skewer was pretty good too. The spices in the green beans were very interesting, it was really delicious but it had a mouth numbing effect. We really liked their handmade noodles though! The texture and taste was great.  In total, our meal came to about $40 after tax and tip for four people ($10 each!), which is so cheap for a dinner. Our approximate savings with the VIP card were about $10 before tip. It would only take one more trip to this place within the next 2 years to make the VIP card worth it.  This is definitely a great place to go if you're ever craving skewers, or during night market season. It's cheap and effective!"}
{"text":"Love extremely loud environments? Then you might like this place. Also for those who love long waits for food. The lamb skewers were good but some of it was fatty. The portions could be a bit larger too. Most of the other dishes we ordered were mediocre."}
{"text":"If you want some authentic Northern Chinese food, this place is it. In fact I don't think there's another place in Toronto that offers this array of options. Recommended by a friend, I took my family here to try and it was a hit!!   We ordered: two types of cold noodles, this lamb soupy noodles, \"Chinese hamburger\", lamb skewers and lamb soup. Super legit and took me back to northern China.   Bonuses: The service is quick and attentive. At an easy to find location too where there's bubble tea and other restaurants nearby.   Verdict: If you're looking for a northern Chinese food, this is a must."}
{"text":"Vacation to Canada and heard this was an amazing restaurant. Came here after looking for it for awhile, and it was quite decent. But the lamb pilaf was not as expected. The taste was bad and it had no flavor whatsoever. It's easy as adding rice, carrots, and lamb all together. We knew at first glance that this wasn't gonna be good. On the other hand, the hand pulled noodles was amazing. It was spicy to the point where it was bearable. The liang feng and buns were decent as well."}
{"text":"Although living close by, this is only the 3rd time I have been there at Xin Jiang Restaurant and for lunch this time. Never thought of taking pictures and write about it but thought I should. One thing I love about this place is that the menu comes with a lot of pictures which is always great if you are not familiar with the cuisine.   Lamb & Fennel Dumplings $5.99 ~This was surprisingly good with lamb juices squirting out after a bite, the black vinegar wasn't really necessary. ~ I have had lamb dumpling at other places in Toronto and they were either flavorless or way too gamey for my taste.    BBQ Lamb Kabob $1.99/ea ~ One of the best lamb kabob in the city, perfectly grilled and seasoned.  BBQ Beef Thin Tendon $1.99/ea ~ This was the first time we try thin tendon on it's own like that and on a skewers. It's usually my fave part when eating beef brisket. ~ This was a bit tough and chewy which I like but thought it wasn't grilled properly and sort of cold.  Braised Lamb served over Nan $18.99 ~The presentation of the picture looked really good and we just had to order it. Thought it would be much smaller but it was actually a 8\" nann and more than 1\" thick. ~ It was a rather large dish and after only one slice I had enough. ~ I personally love the lamb but thought the nann was was too heavy and on the sweet side.  ~ But I guess it was just me cause Ben loved it and end up eating 4 slices. ~ I would have prefer it with a bowl of rice with the lamb and the yummy sauce.  West Chinese Style Lamb Rice $5.99 ~ This look rather plan with just barely a few pieces of lamb but the rice was infuse with flavor. ~ No idea what the rice was made with but loved it, especially with the lightly pickled cabbage on the side which gave it contrast in flavor and texture.   Verdict : ~ Great lamb dishes and one of the best lamb skewers in Toronto. ~ Would love to come back for dinner with more friends and try their spicy dishes"}
{"text":"The presentation and the decor of this place might throw you off but the food here is top notch! My favorite lamb skewers in town, hands down! It's really great value, they're served on a metal skewer (very environmentally friendly), very tender, grilled and seasoned to perfection with one of my favorite Asian bbq spice - cumin.  We also ordered their bean cold noodle, a great contract to the lamb skewer, a perfect combo.  If you're looking for a carb dish, the stir fried noodle is great, huge portions but not lacking in flavor!"}
{"text":"Ok, I went here after I couldn't stand the smell of Tai Ping XIang.  I've been here before with a friend so I knew I wanted to get their lamb skewers.  To be honest, I really really hate lamb. Especially the gamey smell that comes with it.  However, there are only two places I've eaten skewered lamb: here and Chung King.  I prefer the one here better.  However, I still do not like it in the end.  There was too much spice, but I guess you need to in order to hide the fact that the lamb was of low quality.  You want good quality, go to Metro or T&T or even Foody Mart.  They have Norwegian lamb chops for $12 and they are SO MUCH better just a quick grill.  I intend no offense to those who actually think that they put in the right level of spice, but anyone who thinks that you need spices to enjoy food should really try to find a place that would use good ingredients rather than hiding the true taste from you with spices.  The restaurant was empty at the time, but the service was a bit meh and rushed.  What you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant that has no formal training in actually making the customers feel good about eating there.  I had a sip of their hot and sour soup.  That was SO BLOODY SPICY.  I think it would've been good too.  What a waste.  All I could tolerate was a sip.  Finally I just got Beef Fried Rice.  That was about the only thing tolerable in the end.  So I don't think I would recommend or go to this restaurant again anytime soon.  No free wifi"}
