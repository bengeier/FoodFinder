{"text":"This is the second time I've been to this establishment, and by all means the last time I ever intend on going.  The dishes given were initially reasonably tasty (with the exception of the highly substandard side dishes), but I quickly found that the implied limit for refills is once - after the second refill, the food quality (taste and texture) drops to the point where it's actively disgusting, regardless of how it is grilled.  At this point it is effectively inedible.  Service was extremely substandard; the staff were slow to acknowledge our table (a party of two, and one of only three groups), and failed to follow through several times.  An initial request for ox tongue (available \"on request\") was ignored by what appeared to be the manager, and we only received it after asking for other dish refills.    More importantly, and most grievously, not once was our grille replaced with a clean one, even after asking for it twice.  For a korean barbecue place, this is simply unforgivable.  Finally, to add insult to injury, the receipt came with a nasty surprise - an 11% surcharge simply labeled \"Service\" was tacked onto the subtotal, with the implication that its payment was mandatory.   In short: service awful, management money-grubbing, food refills discouraged."}
{"text":"It's really hard to go wrong with grilled meat. Now add the fact that it is all you can eat where you basically make your own food so you really can't hold staff accountable for badly cooked meat, and it's all for only $12.99 - hard to go wrong with that. The sides (kimchi, tofu, bean sprout, radish, soup etc.) were average, but most people come here for the main attraction of meat anyways so it really doesn't matter. Grill Time provides a wide variety of good quality raw meat options from: short ribs (my favorite - very mouth watering), beef, pork, chicken, salmon, fish filet and squid. For an extra few bucks you can also add lamb and shrimp to your course. I love this restaurant as it is a great place for social gatherings but make sure you make reservations ahead of time because they are constantly packed! All-in-all, Grill Time provides a great Korean BBQ experience with their delicious meats and good/fast service. Very enjoyable here."}
{"text":"My friends and I are always fans of Grill Time and we keep coming back for a couple years already.   Tried a few chinese-operated Korean Bbq in town, but then for other places, the marination wasn't that great, the meat wasn't that tender and also the plate portion was smaller -- i.e. you end up waiting in between orders.  Grill time has excellent flat and large-surface-area grills that grill your food evenly (you don't feel like one side of your chicken is burnt while the other side is uncooked). I like the non-spicy beansprouts appetizer a lot (it was marinated very well).  The excellent food choices are their chicken (juicy and huge), beef, white fish and ribs.....hmmmm..... yummmmyyyyyyyy.....  I understand that some people automatically find it insulting when a restaurant opens up and call itself as a Korean BBQ restaurant yet their food is not authentic Korean (and their owner/servers is from Hong Kong/China). I won't argue with them because everyone has his/her own preference.   However what I can say is that all top chefs in the world should be able to cook \"asian\" food that tastes special and great. An so-called \"Italian\" restaurant can also be surperb even if it's owned by Americans. What really matters should be the quality and the taste of the food. I go to both authentic korean restaurant as well as \"Korean Grill\" places opened by Chinese. The idea is simple, when i feel like some authentic Korean food, I can go to some authentic Korean restaurants in Korean Town. If I feel like having lots and lots of yummy barbequed food after a tiring day, I'd go to these Korean bbq restaurants. I think both are special in their own different ways.  Grill time has pretty good service, compared to other places. They refill your water and pop frequently (without you asking). You can even ask them for a jug of pop if you can drink a lot.   They allow you to have your grill changed (after some time of barbequeing, the grill gets burnt). They don't mind you pouring soy sauce on the grill (My weird friends like adding some taste to the food while barbequeing. I don't like it personally because I find the marination is good enough and I don't like my food too salty).  When you want to be left alone and focus on barbequeing and chatting, they won't come by to disturb you. However when you wave at the server to get something, most of the time, they come to your table right away. They let you stay there for a long time (there is never any time limit).  They never charge me or my friends for left-over food (not that we want to waste much food either). So don't give your left-over food to anyone at your table that is not ordering \"All-you-can-eat\" because otherwise if they ever find out, your friend needs to pay all-you-can-eat prices too. I think this is absolutely fair. Don't be stupid and share food with those didn't pay the full price."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and service is speedy. I love the all you can eat barbeque - it's extremely filling and a decent price. They also have vegetarian options. This is one of my favourite places to go when I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Really not the best korean bbq (esp since it isn't run by koreans). It does definitely do the job of filling you up. Better off to going to k town."}
{"text":"Fast service, they fit us in even though it was the end of the night, delicious meats, tons of variety and what better way to get to know your fellow diners than to see how well they can grill? I was more than satisfied with the all you can eat meal for more than a day after I had already eaten it. Delicious, worth it, definitely visit this grill house if you get the chance to."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Grill Time the same way I am of Sushi on Bloor. It's moderately cheap and the food is really delicious, you just have to expect mediocre to terrible service.  It's not the kind of place you go when you want to be waited on, but if you want your favourite meat grilled in front of you, go with some friends and have a blast."}
{"text":"Please don't eat here.  The food is low-quality, cold, and overpriced. The staff are unpleasant and poorly trained. The atmosphere is off-putting.   There are other Korean BBQ places less than 15 minutes walk away. Go to them. They are better.  I have nothing witty or funny to say about this restaurant. I was happy when I arrived and sad when I left."}
{"text":"Came here after work.... Kimchi was super cold, the Bento box was inedible, and the place wreaked of wet mop. Avoid at all costs.   The prices are low here but it's too high a price to pay for the lack of service, the garbage food, and the stench of poor hygiene.  The tastiest thing was the water.... But water isn't supposed to taste like that."}
{"text":"Would not recommend.  My boyfriend and I had seen this place while walking around downtown a month ago and thought we'd give it a go since it was closer than our normal Korean BBQ place. We are not going back.   The placement of the switch to turn on the stove made things awkward. I was wearing a dress and the switch was between my knees, just awkward placement. I am about 5'3 and I found it every hard to reach everything. While there I even saw people leave due to the inability to reach across the BBQ. We ate in silence most of the time since we were to far apart to speak in a normal indoor voice. The service was fine. However getting the food was strange, they brought all the choices to the table, I would rather pick and choose what I want since I do not enjoy fish and I do not eat pork. The foods itself was not that great. They chicken was so thick that I felt uncomfortable eating it in the dim light so we sent it back. The meat was in large pieces so it was harder to flip. The sides weren't great. My boyfriend and I love pickled radish as a side since it is a great way to refresh your pallet but this one lacked acidity. The spouts seemed old, as did the kimchi. The bill is the main reason we will not return. It did not print correctly so we were unable to see the breakdown on the right side. We looked it over since it seemed high and noticed a service charge. I did not feel the service was worth the $5 charge but after a long day I didn't feel like bothering with it. As far as the look of the place, it seemed clean on the outside but my table felt almost sticky. The money pinned up by the cash register was really tacky in a more modern looking restaurant. The tables are placed in a way were you get to make creepy eye contact with other customers the while time.  Though the drinks were included and had free refills. My boyfriend said the pork was good and was thin.   For ask you can eat, go somewhere else. It looks nice but it's not worth the money."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here for dinner over the wknd. Great food at an amazing price! $12.99/pp all-u-can-eat on wknds for dinner. Cheaper if you go for lunch or on specific days of the week. It was quite busy when we arrived but we didn't have to wait for a table. The starting set is: kimchi, spicy bean sprouts, regular bean sprouts, daikon, mini salad, grilled potato, fried tofu, sliced beef, short ribs, salmon, some kind of white fish, chicken, squid and I think lamb. After that you can order more of whatever else you want. They also have a seafood menu too that you can order from, or add it to your all-you-can-eat for more money.   The food was good and fresh. Service was just ok. I was just visiting Toronto from the States. If I was to go to Toronto again I'd definitely come back here to eat!  Note: Korean Grill House is a few blocks away with a similar menu and price. We walked past there first but didn't see many ppl inside so decided to skip it and go here instead. Not disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants to eat Korean- both taste-wise and money-wise. I never leave with an empty stomach! They have two options- you can either order all-you-can-eat or just order items from the menu. During lunch hours and at night (after 10pm), they have a cheaper menu for all-you-can-eat for around CAD8 whereas the normal menu is around CAD12. They offer a variety of beef, pork, chicken, fish, and a number of small korean appetizers. If you choose to order items from the menu, they offer korean lunch boxes which are pre-cooked for you by the staff.    They have a lot of staff but it tends to get busy so they may take a bit longer serving you. However, it is a great place to socialize with your friends and cook your meal together."}
{"text":"If you like grilling your own lunch or dinner, and are a fan of Korean bbq, then this is a very good option.  For the price, I found the quality as good, if not better, than any other Korean BBQ spot in the downtown.  The tofu/kimchi/potato side dishes that come with the meal are so-so, but are nice for an app while you wait for the first round of grilled meats to finish up.  The service is hit and miss, and its impossibly loud during busy hours (especially fri-sat evenings after 6pm), but other than that, its a winner."}
{"text":"Short: great food, nice design, friendly staff.    Detail: great for any time of the day. My favourite: the all you can eat menu with tasty fish, pork, beef and chicken. Every table has its own grill, making it a good place to visit with a bunch of friends."}
{"text":"Best place ever if you're doing the whole low carb thing. Make sure you ask for NON-MARINATED MEAT to really avoid the carbs. You can always phone in and ask if they have that there. They usually do.  I would really recommend this place for post workout :)  Don't order the bibimbap here. Just don't. It is sub par. There are other Korean places that make it better."}
{"text":"Walking South on Yonge Street my stomach suddenly growled, and it growled just as I was passing 'Grill Time', perhaps it was a sign, and since the windows were properly cleaned I decided to venture in.   Table for one.  The waiter debated whether he should sit me deep into the restaurant or right by the window, unfortunately he choose the window..I'll just pretend he thought I was handsome and would make for good visual merchandising.  Like that episode of The Simpson where Homer is hired by the seafood restaurant to prove to other customers just how \"all you can eat\" the place really was.  But I had to be fat for that wouldn't I?  I'm not... There's no way I'm having Korean Barbecue by myself, so I ordered the chicken bento box and spicy tuna roll, I also ordered green tea which cost 80 cents.     My seat was very uncomfortable because there was no room to stretch my legs as the propane storage was directly in to my front.  I could have stretched it to the side, but that was where all the valves and pipes were, and I was afraid that I might cause a gas leak of some sort.  The lighting was sufficient but the ultra-bright heating fan by the entrance blinded me every ten seconds as the glowing hot pan swung around to blow the patrons with imaginary heat.  It is too much to ask for a little bit of twenty-first century insulation?  My green tea came well after both of my dishes, and it took 15 minutes just to get a glass of freezing lemon water.  One of the waiter boys kept staring at me, so I ended playing the 'caught you staring at me' game that is so often enjoyed on subway trains.    But redemption was to be had as I sunk my teeth into the food, as it was well prepared, the chicken very tender, and the sushi was too shabby either.  Normally I would have ordered more, but I had a social function to attend thus I needed to keep the puffiness of my face down to a tolerable level.  The most amazing thing was that I was sufficiently satisfied, and the meal only cost thirty cents over thirteen dollars.  Now that's fair regardless what kind of Asian you are.   The washroom wasn't as dirty as the surrounding restaurants, and I had no real complaint about the service (aside from gawking boy by the counter).   The décor was what you'd expect, but it wasn't about that.  Real cheap sushi here that doesn't taste like crap, I'm surprised. Oh btw, the two televisions on opposite ends of the restaurant actually correlates to the sound coming from the speakers...unlike other Korean sports bars where Hockey is complimented by 20 girls singing K-Pop about how much they hate men.    Next time I come here I'll wear my shades, and my stretchy pants.    Grill Time Korean BBQ House huh?  I'll be sure to set my clock.."}
{"text":"Normally I yelp a restaurant first before I even consider it, especially when I'm traveling. However, we were starving as we left our hotel (Courtyard by Marriott) and Grill Time was just across the street, so we decided to give it a shot. And for a random walk-in, I was pleasantly surprised and very full by the time we left.  The good: My favorites were probably the short rib and the squid. The rib got a nice char, and the squid was sweet and flavorful. We also liked some of the banchan: the kimchee, the pickled radish, the spicy bean sprout, and the potatoes.  The bad: The fish, which was nice to have included and justified the higher than average buffet price (around $20 with unlimited drinks), was bland.   The funny: We loved the banchan so much (and were so hungry while our meat was cooking) that we kept asking for refills of our favorite sides. By the third request, our main server (who was very nice) finally got the hint and brought us a \"supersize\" bowl of each that sustained us for the rest of our meal.  Would I recommend to a friend? Probably if they were stuck around Yonge and craving Korean BBQ like we were."}
{"text":"The people that run this place have achieved something extraordinary: a restaurant that is so terrible, it is spectacle to be experienced first hand... that is, if you don't have better things to do with $20 (which would be better spent on bartering with the block corner hobo for his half eaten Tim Horton's sandwich).   But anyways, you see, this place is full of amazing surprises. The set-up is standard enough, just what you might expect from a typical Korean BBQ joint. But...  It all starts when you sit down, and attempt to order your food. First you will discover no one working there is in a hurry to coming around. Actually you will find the employees standing as far away from you as possible, in a small huddle talking to each other. Their strategy seems to be to ignore your pitiful existence and your audacity to take up space and breathing room in their restaurant just long enough so you may leave already. \"Well, no, that can't be\", you say to yourself, and you are patient, so you can wait... but after 15 minutes of waiting, even the oh-so-patient you decides it is time to yell one of the waitresses over.  Ah, but yet you will utterly fail like a moron. You see, they are much smarter than you, and they already expect you might try to holler for their attention. On each side of the restaurant, they have installed three massive large screen TVs, which are somehow perpetually on a channel that is broadcasting soccer games of obscure leagues in some Slavic language blasted at such high volumes that you can't even hear yourself yell, so much for the waitresses.  But you still persist. Now you might resort to helplessly flailing your arms, jumping up and down. Yes, the waitresses can't ignore you forever. Ah, success!! One sees you and grudgingly walks over while rolling her eyes. But when she does, you will wish you had never called her over. You will wish you could just shrivel and die in that moment. Why? Because the waitress will look at you with the most heinous look, so full of despite and inexplicable hatred, you become suspicious of yourself... \"did I ever beat-up this girl's grandfather? I must have done something to deserve this!!\".  \"Snap out of it. That can't be. I'll just order my food.\" You say to yourself... insanity is already slowly but surely creeping in.  So finally you can order what you want. Here you will see the most amazing feat of memory being displayed in front of you. You may order 10 different things. The waitress nods her head every time you say something, but you don't see a note pad. Incredible! \"She is memorizing everything I am saying, how can she?! Wow!!!\"   But it is not long before you discover her magic secret. You see, between the blasting TVs, her poor English, her complete hatred towards you as a customer, on top of her utter apathy towards her responsibilities as a waitress, she didn't actually attempt to remember anything you said. She just went to the computer console, and just punched in some random dish orders. As long as you get some sort of thing that looks like food, it will be sufficient and she can go back to the little huddle they are making in the far end of the restaurant, far again from the despicable stench the customers.  Endless eternity passes, and the food does come... eventually anyways. At least they got the water you ordered right. You taste the food... incredible! Somehow everything tastes like week old dog food. The fish, the meat, the rice. Everything tastes like stale dog food. Wow, how do they do that? A culinary feat indeed.  So you eat and finish, because you are starving, and you don't complain because you don't want to offend the angry people any more than you already have by coming here. Now it is time to pay, and you are itching to get your sorry ass out of there. But it is also an opportunity to strike back and get a bit of revenge. Since the service and food was so incredibly bad, perhaps you will try to retaliate by not giving any tip.   and then BAAAMMM!! The next awesome surprise blow. A kick in the balls so hard, that you may just throw up the dog food: A $2 service charge automatically slapped on your bill. This is how incredibly smart they are. They just charge $2 from everyone. No need actually give any service. And I guarantee you, at this moment you will wish that you could instead use that $2 to pay someone to beat the leaving crap out of you... because that will feel better than paying $2 for the atrocious \"service\" and food you got here. In a last desperate attempt to get back, you think about vomiting the dog food you just ate in the restaurant... but you must hold back, realizing that the only thing worse than the after taste of the dog food is the after taste of the dog food flavored vomit.  You walk out, disillusioned, hating life, hating yourself... vowing never to return, forever having been scarred by this dining experience. But cheer up... after this, no other restaurant can possibly seem bad to you."}
{"text":"i really love it. great foods and great service!! the best BBQ restaurant in toronto, i think.."}
{"text":"This is the best all you can eat Koran grill in all the land. Their lunch and dinner prices are a steal, and the food is delish!  Ive been coming for years and its always such a treat.   Its a fun experience with the food cooking right in front of you.   Love the enterior of the resturant, very cool design.  Love it love it love it."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I've ever been to this location when the service wasn't so horrible I wanted to grill my own hand.  So improvements on that end.  Note that we went past 9 pm, so the place was winding down for the night, as opposed to busy dinner hours.  Food is good, although you do get the feeling everything is reused (i.e. if you don't finish your beef, the same table next to you is getting it).  The bathrooms are really gross and the trip to get to them makes you even more uneasy about health violations.    So why three stars?  Well, you get to eat a lot of radishes and bean sprouts and the sausage is delicious.  What can I say?  Endless amounts of meat earns a star.   Oh, and they will always try to give you the worst possible table location first.  Don't settle for first offer."}
{"text":"I love Korean BBQ, but every time I come here, I always remember thinking I might as well go elsewhere. Superficially, it might seem that it does not differ much from the other grill restaurants, but its probably the worst choice. I never have felt like there was any part of it that was better then other restaurants.  Sushi was abominable.   When I havent gone to this place, I forget what its like and I try and give it another chance, but everytime I always realize I like it least.  No major complaints with the service, in fact, I have felt well attended to here sometimes, but other times felt it was terrible."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. When it was time to leave me and my friend asked for the bill. When we got our computerized bill we noticed it was modified by pen. The server had the nerve to write in his own tip on the bill! He wrote in \"service charge $3.00\" in pen. I understand tip is automatically added on bills with big groups but for 2 people!!? If this didn't happen we would have gave him a bigger tip than $3.00. He messed up by doing that. This isn't right and I will never return again!"}
{"text":"If you want to pay for food poisoning go ahead. Yeah it's that bad! I rarely give one star but this one deserves it! Day old meat, crummy sides and poor service."}
{"text":"This is my first 1-star review. It takes a lot for me to rate something that low. Checking past reviews, it seems this place has gone downhill in late 2011/2012, because ratings were almost all above 3 stars before then.  Unfortunately, as my first Korean BBQ experience, this whole thing was bad. My party of two was seated by a waiter who couldn't explain how the whole \"Korean BBQ\" system thing worked, because his English wasn't adequate. The menu is written in badly-punctuated English, also adding to the confusion.  Service took forever. After ordering the meats, we moved onto Sushi, and that took another eternity. The waiter didn't understand we'd actually ordered Sushi earlier at the beginning of the meal, so it never came. We had to order again. I asked for a water refill, which never came, until more food was delivered. The chicken had too much cuts of fat in it. Our waiter never asked us how our meal was, and never came around when he didn't have to. Upon the sushi's arrival, I asked for soy sauce and wasabe, and he looked at me like no one had ever asked for that before. The teriyaki chicken sushi was too salty, and the avocado-cucmber's roll was too tough. All the rolls were cut into piece too big to eat properly, so they all fell apart upon consumption.  By the end of the meal, we didn't even receive our cheque. Our waiter was nowhere to be found, and we had to go up to the register to pay. I couldn't get out of here fast enough. Never again.  Also, what is with the horse racing channel on all the TVs? Are the wait staff placing horse wagers in between serving customers? Maybe that's why our orders were so slow."}
{"text":"Downtown location and close to public transit.  The cut of meat is nice; the marination of the meat is not too salty and not with MSG.  Dinner has two options.  The lower option comes with a selection of maki and hand rolls; the higher option comes with shrimp, lamb, and a fair selection of sushi."}
{"text":"I love Korean BBQ. But it's definitely a meal you'll have to save room for! I go here with my boyfriend all the time I love it. When you come in, they bring in a million bowls of what I think are like Korean appetizers. They have kim chi, spicy potatoes, deep fried noodles, spicy beans, and a bunch of other tasty nibblies. At Grill Time they offer a selection of platters, we usually get the one with beef ribs, pork, a white fish, and one weird meat like shark fin that we never actually eat. All the meat is seasoned and then you throw it on the grill in front of you and cook it.   Don't worry about undercooking it - it's pretty hard to mess it up, The only thing I find hard to cook is the fish which often falls apart on the grill. But the pork and beef ribs are to die for - the seasoning is a blend of sweet and salty spices and it just melts in your mouth if you its cooked properly.  We usually order some rice to go along with the meat. The meat is also unlimited which is why I said you should save room, cause my pants are usually busting after I'm done eating here.   If you haven't had Korean BBQ, it's a fun experience and you should definitely try it - and Grill Time is a great place to do it!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place, until this evening. My experience today has turned me off them completely. I refuse to patronise this establishment ever again, and if I could somehow find an email address for the place I would express my frustration with them.  I believe I was subjected to the Asian version of racism against white people. I was having a lovely dinner with a friend. We were merrily frying our meat on the grill. Behind my friend was a rather boisterous party of young asian kids (I think they were korean, but who knows). Generally I don't mind exuberance. But these kids were so loud I couldn't hear my friend when he yelled something at me across the grill.  We had asked our server if he could have a word with the party. He stared at us blankly, did a half shrug/half nod and wandered away. Not once did he approach the party to ask them to tone it down a little, so that we could actually have an enjoyable meal.  At the cash register we asked the server why he did not speak to the young party. The excuse we got was \"they are young\". When asked why he's using that excuse, again with the half shrug/half nod. When asked if I could speak to a manager I got a blank look & a mumbled comment that there was no manager on site at the time.  If you are prepared to be discriminated against by a bunch of rude waiters this is the place for you. For me, I refuse to go there again."}
{"text":"I've come here so many times, I'm pretty much a regular here.  But why haven't I reviewed it??  Anyways, this place is awesome!  The meats are good, and plentiful.  THE RIBS THE RIBS THE RIBS THE RIBS THE RIBS THE RIBS THE RIBS  ps, I love the ribs.  Go for the special dinner. Totally worth it.  My fav meats from this place  1. THE RIBS 2. THE RIBS 3. The LAMB 4. The Chicken 5. THE SAUSAGE 6. THE RIBS   I'm pretty sure they drugs the ribs.   I love you ribs.    Oh, they also have other things.  All you eat sushi, hand rolls and maki.  Not the best sushi, but why would you bother?  The side dishes are standard.  Drink is 2$ with free refills.  Sometimes, if you want veggies you may have to ask a few times.    * * * *"}
{"text":"Read the older comments about how the service was bad. i thought in my mind i was scared that i would get the same bad service today, although i didnt really care cause all i wanted was just the food, if the service was bad just dont pay the tips!! So i went there, turn out the service was REALLY GOOD, FAST and EFFICIENT, pays full attention to customers, everyone was nice there, unlike all the other asian place having Chinese servers that cannot speak ENGLISH and gives you bad attitude.  P.S. if you want real Korean BBQ with Korean owners, do not come here, this is a fusion restaurant, being in Canada when it says fusion you should know what it means....Price is reasonable and fair!!! it is way better then the other chain Korean bbq restaurant who adds in loads of MSG which i believed this one adds way lesser then what it should have."}
{"text":"If you like being yelled at by a waitress with only two months experience, then THIS is the restaurant for you! If you like to be told by said waitress that the menu is wrong, then talk to the manager (or, someone I THOUGHT was the manager in a tremendously dirty shirt) and was told that the menu isn't wrong, all the while the waitress is now yelling louder and all the back of house staff are now coming out to see what the yelling is all about....then, this restaurant is for you!  I should have realized that if a downtown restaurant, at 6pm across from a plethora of tourist filled hotels and attractions is empty of customers, then there's something definitely wrong.  I'll know for next time, I guess!  It's slid a long way from it's niceness when it first opened. Blek."}
{"text":"My friend and I usually stop here when we're really hungry and are downtown near the Eatons Centre. The service here is average, it's not exceptional but it's not too slow either.   Drinks are bottomless,which is great during the summer. In addition to the korean bbq,they've now added sushi to their lunch/dinner! The sushi wasn't amazing but after going there 3 or 4 times, it was nice to see change.  Love the meat, very delicate and tender. But the fish was terrible, after the first time I stopped ordering fish. When it's on the grill, the fish spreads apart.  Overall 3/5.  I would recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"I guess the price has gone up for dinner.  $13.99 is the price now but I think it's still a great deal.  You can pay more for shrimp and lamb added on but I already had enough food for 1 person.  Water or tea is free.  You also get an assortment of 6-8 side dishes (kimchi, sprouts, mashed potatoes, etc).  Got dishes of beef, pork, chicken, salmon, snapper, short ribs, squid and beef.  I think putting the fish on the grill didn't work well because it stuck all the time.  Next time, dip it in the sauce and grill it.  But, my fav dish was the short ribs - had to get 2!  The service was great.  Perhaps it was that there weren't alot of people at 6:30pm on a Wednesday night.  Will come here again but would do it in a group."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! This was the single worst dining experience I have ever had - and I am not a super picky eater or anything.  The service was terrible, food was cold, my drink came 10 minutes after my friends' with no explanation.  My friends ordered hot pots, the server asked them if they wanted hot sauce, one did, one didn't.  Instead of bringing the sauce, he put TONS into the pots himself (even the one who didnt want any) and then proceeded to smash the food around in the bowl to mix the sauce in himself, he wouldn't stop when we asked him.  He broke all the shrimp in the bowl and made the food like mush as he smashed each pot for at least 2 minutes without letting us stop him.  My food was cold and unflavorful.  I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, but if you are looking for this type of food in this area, walk about 3 blocks south and go to Korean Grill.  At least they will ask you how your meal is and not smash it to oblivion."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN AM I EVER GOING HERE!!!!  This girl...SALLY...man the service being slow and lazy is one thing RUDE is another thing.  I sat down i'm almost finished my decent meal and I ask for a refill on the coke.  She drops my glass on the other table and tells the guy in mandarin \"Don't fill it too much or they'll stay longer\".  HOLY SHIT just because I speak english doesn't mean I don't understand you!!!  So of course to throw her off I asked for my bill in Mandarin, oh you should've seen her face!  She was shocked because she realized I understood her.  I get my bill and I noticed THEY ADD A $5 SERVICE CHARGE.  Are you kidding me in what world is there a service charge in a korean bbq for two people...or in any restaurant!  I ask what the hell is this that i've been there for years and i've never seen this, she tells me oh sorry i'll take it off.    She gives me the bill I go up to pay and of course i ask for her name and the managers name because I think what she did was crazy.  I pay I DONT leave a tip and as i walk out I see her roll her F*%$ing eyes and scuff at me.  ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?!  I go up to her and I say \"excuse me what as that\" she said she didnt say anything...wonderful i don't care if u didnt say anything I saw you roll ur eyes and im getting mad at this point...so what does she do  SHE HOLDS HER FINGER UP IN MY FACE AND TELLS ME TO \"SHHHHH\"  Even my bf lost it there and hes a very calm guy.  I start going a little thermal nuclear on her until the manager comes and asks whats going on, of course he doesn't speak a lick of english and my mandarin isn't that great.  He said if i hadn't paid then just leave, at this point im demanding a refund for the WORST service.  The other waiters know me I've been there once a month for 6 years or so.  They eventually tell the girl to walk away and stop arguing with me because boy was she still arguing with me.    The other two waiters had to translate for me to tell the manager what was happening.  They tell me the girl is new (I don't care), they tell me they will take my tip off (ARE YOU CRAZY U THINK I'D TIP THAT BITCH?),   they tell me finally that they can't fire her,  WTF when did i ask u to fire her?  I said she should be fired but worst comes to worst she NEEDS to be trained.  I told them i don't want her fired I just want my money back for ruining my evening.  Their reasoning was you ate the food so just go.  I argued but at the end I had no time I really wanted papaya hut.  So I give you a true solid F*#( YOU to this business, and I hope my fellow yelpers will stop going here as I think service should stand for something.  I think we deserve better than rude people telling their customers to \"shhh\" and telling them not to fill the cup so they'll leave.  I think we deserve to go on a night out after working 8 hours to a nice meal, not to a eye rolling bitch.   Who cares if I can swallow the food, with service like that it'll just makes me sick faster than the food poisoning you'd get.  IMHO."}
{"text":"This place is cheap. 14.99+tax for all you can eat dinner, that includes beef, chicken, pork, ox tongue, fish filet, salmon, squid and all the side dishes, soup and rice, etc. But this place is also cheap for a reason.  The only thing that was redeeming was the kimchi; the rest of the stuff were all a little stale and bland. This is the first time I had to eat at a korean bbq where I had to dip my food in the soy sauce NOT because it wasn't salty enough,but because i wanted to hide the stale taste of the meat. Needless to say, I walked away feeling like I just ate a bucket of salt...definitely gonna be bloated tomorrow.  The service is insanely slow. Barely anyone in the restaurant but it'll take you over ten minutes to wave down a server, and another fifteen minutes before you can get what you asked for. Sometimes you have to ask them twice.  I would rather pay extra and get better food.  TIP: don't get the ox tongue.On the menu, it says ask for it if you want it, which makes the meat turnover rate to be very low. When I got the meat, it was still frozen and pretty stale. I regretted asking for it.  Now excuse me as I will now need to take a shower and attempt to wash the grease off of my face and the smell off of my fingers for the third time."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. I love the side dishes, especially the sweet potato tasting stuff. I ate so many of those the AYCE almost didn't feel worth it. I loved the taste of the beef and pork. Chicken was decent but not my thing. Grilled veggies and the white fish were ew. Salmon was alright. Service was fast and frequently visitng our table. I wouldn't go here that often though since it's just so much meat!"}
{"text":"Grill Time Korean BBQ is loocated near Yonge and Carlton. The place has a glass front allowing a lot of light into the long narrow restaurant. Everything on the inside is designed with an eye to dark, natural materials, giving the place a warm although slick feel. The tables were laid out perpendicular to the walls with BBQ grills set into the tables in-between 2 diners. A friend likened them to hubcabs making it seem like a Korean version of white-trash backyard BBQ. And grilling your own food does create a casual fun atmosphere.   The format is simple, a selection of meats, fish and a few vegetables arrives in small stackable dishes, the hubcab is turned on and you BBQ your own dinner. On the side are few typical Korean dishes of assorted pickles and kimchis and a dish for a syrupy soy sauce. We ran two separate grills one for meat and the other for fish and vegetables. The food was all you can eat and the price was reasonable for what you received. It was an interesting experience that would be best experienced and enjoyed on a really cold day, savouring the warmth of the grill and the BBQ in the face of the cold outside."}
