{"text":"We went to Farm and Craft last night for my birthday dinner, and it was the worst service we have ever had, from start to finish. The hostess ignored us, and we waited 8 minutes to be greeted by our server when we were sat. I ordered a beer, it took 10 minutes to get. We waited another 5 minutes to order, and the appetizer took 25 minutes to get, and the entrees came out a minute later. To be fair, the restaurant was very busy. But the service was terrible. We will not be back, which is a shame, because this used to be one of our favorite spots. I'm not sure what's going on with this place, it's gotten worse and worse. Do yourself a favor, and don't go here, unless you sit at the bar, and only come during the day. The dinner service is a train wreck."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a great review.  We came with such high hopes: great location right on the street, cool atmosphere, and a trendy menu. But unfortunately the food was actually quite bland, overpriced, and underwhelming.   We were actually on the way to another restaurant when we turned around to come here because it SEEMED like it was going to be a wonderful experience.    We had 6 people in our party, so we were able to try several different menu items.  Everything came out bland and very small.  The chicken was dry, the eggs were way under-seasoned, and the portions were more like what we get at a tapas bar.  We felt horrible for our waitress who had to drop off the plates at the table and see everybody's faces.   We will stick to our usual brunch places."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while now. I came on a Sunday morning for brunch. The place was packed which is expected for this day of the week. Only a 15 minute wait which was surprising. The food was healthy, tastie, and presented well. I enjoyed the atmosphere. I ordered the steak bowl, it was excellent. My rating is obvious as I had no complaints with service and enjoyed my time."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place- unfortunately, it didn't live up to the expectation.  Don't get me wrong - it's a neat concept and the decor is kind of cool.  Service was sub-par at best.  Although we may have just had a poor server - the rest of the tables appeared happy with their service.  The beer taps weren't working because it was too warm???  Agreed it was hot out but when you're a craft beer business I would think that might be something you consider in Phoenix AZ.  The food was ok - interesting and certainly fresh.  We had a mushroom flatbread that was way too heavy in truffle oil and arugula and way too light in mushrooms while the crust was tasteless.  The roasted chicken was - well, weak at best.  Over cooked and tough.    The concept certainly is interesting but I won't be back.  It pales to any other farm to table restaurants I've eaten at.  And the craft selection even if working was poor."}
{"text":"Ahhh moment upon entering! Fresh clean open airy feel- knew we came to the right place for post-workout fuel. Wellness is abundant here. Loved the kale salad w/ salmon, the Greek yogurt parfait with HUGE berries, and our very own flask of hibiscus green tea. Sweet and friendly servers. Will be back for the bar treats and more Mama-daughter time! Affection-food-community"}
{"text":"Just had a delicious paleo meal here! Had the roasted chicken, sweet potato mash, cauliflower, and a side of Brussel Sprouts. Kombucha nectarine cocktail to pair. For dessert I had the paleo brownie without ice cream. It was so good... moist, warm and chocolate-y. Everything was scrumptious and I'll be back. Food was comparable or superior to Flower Child or True Food Kitchen. Ambiance was on point. Make sure to say \"hi\" to Andrew, he's the best server in Phoenix-metro/Scottsdale and will go out of his way to accommodate your food restrictions/preferences."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place out but was disappointed with your food choices.  My guest enjoyed her dinner and would return again. I understand they are shooting for \"healthy\" but the food for me was to dry. This place was clean help full and enjoyed the people watching."}
{"text":"The food is very good, but they should close down till they can get the fly infestation in check. Didn't mind paying for good food, but at that price it should not come with flies that bug you throughout your meal."}
{"text":"Love this spot for brunch! Menu options for everyone and fun favorites with healthier twists. Cocktail menu is superb. Any of the forbidden fruit drinks are a must!"}
{"text":"The menu is uninspiring. The food is meh. The wine, both red and white is at the low end of the spectrum. There is no reason to return. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Loved the food and interesting cocktails. DÃ©cor is industrial/artistic and cool, and even inside it sort of feels like you're outside. Both my wife and I remarked afterwards that we felt good: maybe we just felt morally superior after eating the kale Caesar (which was tasty, to my surprise) but instead of feeling logy and gross like you do after a big fatty meal, we both felt great."}
{"text":"Great food, great ambience - perfect Saturday afternoon hangout! We got a bottle of the rose cava with some salad and flatbread. Unique flavors with true farm fresh feel. Will be back on our next trip to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I am unable to review the food or even the water at this place because I wasn't served or even acknowledged. Just left there on a Monday night. The place wasn't overly busy and our party of 3 was promptly greeted and seated by the host. That was where things went crappy. We sat at our table for a good 5-7 minutes and were left sitting there without any server coming up to bring us water, take a drink order or anything? Meanwhile the entire staff was goofing around laughing and trying to look cool, chic and hipster. Deadbeats is what I call the staff. Owners need to hire some people who actually will work harder at their job and less at trying to be cool. Thing is they didn't even care when I got up and left.  Lame."}
{"text":"Delicious food, tasty drinks but terrible service. 4 of us came for the 1st time for breakfast and at 1st glance this place had a great atmosphere. We had a nice set up in the patio and after 20 minutes our waiter didn't come to our table. We had to go to the hostess to ask for service. After 5 more minutes a waiter came over and took our order. After 40 minutes we finally got our food and drinks. Overall food was great: The breakfast sandwich was tasty. Bloody Mary was awesome. Protein pancakes were mediocre. Someone came to our table to apologize when our food arrived. This place has so much potential but lack of service was not acceptable."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh ingredients. The pay attention to details here, which I love as a restaurant owner myself!"}
{"text":"This place was super disappointing- went in for brunch on my birthday. Service was mediocre at best, indifferent and unfriendly. The worst was the food. I ate it because I was starving but it was barely warm and had no flavor. Eggs not cooked as order, breakfast potatoes and sausage limp. Also ordered the brioche which sounds amazing on the menu - its basically a slice of bread barely toasted on one side with some cold mascarpone cheese and strawberries on top. SO tasteless for such a supposedly nice combination of ingredients. Won't be going back or recommending to anyone."}
{"text":"Took some friends out for lunch. Service was a bit slow at first but they were busy so it was understandable. Had the pleasure of having their strawberry and goat cheese salad with chicken and it was bomb. I will definitely be back here. Probably tonight."}
{"text":"Health oriented menu from fresh ingredients.  Lots of flax in anything grain oriented. Didn't bother me but may not be something everyone likes.  Flaxseed wheat Flatbread was good but not amazing.  The make your own meal items were very well priced and had good smaller portions.  You'll want to consider several items if you're used to use portions but it won't cost you a lot here.  The faro Mac and cheese is unique and worth trying.  My companion tried that with grilled chicken which made an excellent light dinner.  Typical industrial construction that suffers from bad loud acoustics.  Interesting menu but tries a bit too hard to sell the random health facts about their food.  If you're looking for a casual hip place with both inside and outside seating and are in the mood for something that tries to be a bit healthier give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Awesome decor and environment. Food and drinks are outstanding! The tocoa bowl is delicious and tastes like a home cooked meal. Definitely highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time I came here, service was average and the food was great. Second time I came here, food was average and the service started out amazing (we sat at the bar.) There were two blonde girls helping us and they were both very attentive. But then around 12 they brought on an additional couple bartenders and for some reason the more people the added the more dysfunctional everything became. We ended up waiting 20 minutes for them to take our next drink order, and after watching them for another 10 and they hadn't started making them, we asked for our check which was another 10 minute process. I've been a bartender for years and honestly the other two guys they brought on seemed hungover and in the way of the girls that had been working so hard in the first place. It was just a cluster*** and I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner last night with great friends and was blown away! Not only were all of our courses out of this world but the fun and energetic staff just added to the cool vibe of the place. Oh and did I mention the Wellness Martini??? You have to have the Wellness Martini!"}
{"text":"We hit the joint on a Thursday night to qualify for their $20 special for 1 bottle of wine and flatbread combo.  How could you go wrong? The wellness orientation was appealing. Where else can you find 6 kombucha and alcohol mixers on the menu?  The chicken tacos were really wonderful and the Kale Caesar salad was okay and perhaps the mushroom flatbread was lackluster because of the eeny-mini mushrooms.  Our waiter was kind and considerate AND attractive, largely because of his very white teeth as my dinner date explained.   The restaurant itself was also attractive with its indoor/outdoor bar and mixed seating set-up and high ceilings. Happy to have found this gem in the midst of Old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"You place your order at the counter in the back and they bring your food to you. Lots of outdoor seating with heaters.   Had a very pleasant lunch. My friend and I shared a flatbread and an order of brussel sprouts. The flatbread was really good, and so big we couldn't finish it. Brussel sprouts were really good too."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place as I run past it every morning and have watched it being built. Unfortunately, while the food is good, it's nothing remarkable. It works for me because it's fairly 'clean' and I have multiple food sensitivities, but it's just not 'right' yet. We ordered roasted seasonal veggies which came out raw. When we asked about the raw \"roasted\" veggies the server said they weren't roasting any veggies yet due to not having a roaster!  She should have told us that up front as we didn't want a bowl of raw veggies. Then I ordered the Rustic Bowl which was roasted veggies, quinoa and steak.  So, do they have a roaster?  Or not!  LOL My husband had the Farmhouse flatbread and he said it was really good. I like the style and idea of this place, and while not original, it was nice, simple, clean food. We may wait a few weeks and try again."}
{"text":"Love the food! Steak in the steak sandwich was delicious & cooked perfectly. Veggie side dishes amazing (Brussels sprouts & broccolini.) Great selection of beers & wine, fully stocked bar for cocktails. Server was super friendly & answered all questions."}
{"text":"Great decor and ambiance. The food was ok. Small portions and pricey. $15 for brussel sprouts with grassfed steak and an ice tea for lunch today- I left hungry. My girlfriends strawberry and goat cheese salad with sustainable salmon looked delicious but insignificant. I will tell you that I was stoked to see they carry Bulletproof bars!"}
{"text":"Clean, organic and delicious food! The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and decor. We had \"chicken, brocollini and sprouts\", \"salmon and farro\" and steak ( if you like rare, make sure to emphasize that, because the steak was served \"medium\".  The staff is nice but seems a little hectic and disorganized."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place and was looking forward to my birthday dinner here with my family, but there was a hair in my entree that I found after taking a bite of my poke bowl. I was mortified. The waitress seems unapologetic and took the bowl back to have it replaced. Who's to say I actually got it remade? Needless to say, I didn't want to eat after that. I'm not looking for a handout, but no even my Diet Coke was comped as an \"I'm sorry.\"  As a general rule of good customer service and as a business owner myself, I would've been apologizing profusely and would have seemed it any way to make it right with the customer. My family stated the their food was just ok...not bad but nothing to write home about. I'm throughly disappointed in he service. I'll never be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! Great food, service, atmosphere and location. Love the healthy variety on the menu! As a tip, make a reservation if you're planning on enjoying it on a weekend night. Otherwise the wait was can be a little long."}
{"text":"I went here with a big group for lunch a couple days after they first opened. I get we were a big party and they're new, but I never got my order. I ordered a salad, while others in my group had more complicated things that came out quicker. A couple others didn't get their orders either, and when we went to check on it, they said they were going as fast as they can. After 10 more minutes, we went to check again and they asked us what we ordered. Clearly they weren't even making anything, and they wouldn't admit to forgetting about us. The manager asked for our receipts and said he would comp our meals. He didn't.   A server said my order was in the window waiting, but we asked for our food to go and it still took another 10 minutes to bag my salad and bring it to me. Then after a few more minutes my friends finally got their food and we left. Two hours after going to lunch I'm back at my computer having to eat while I work because my lunch break is long over.   Oh, and the salad was awful. I got the strawberry and goat cheese salad, and I didn't realize that meant literally one strawberry. Seriously, there were four strawberry slices cut up laying right next to each other and no other slices anywhere in the salad. The cheese was in a gooey layer at the bottom of the salad, and there were maybe four or five walnuts. It had an odd peppery taste to it I couldn't place. All the ingredients they list on the menu led me to believe it would be sweet. I couldn't finish it.  So, I ended up paying $9 for a salad I didn't eat after waiting over an hour and a half. No one was particularly apologetic over losing our orders, and while the manager was nice, he ended up not comping our meals like he said."}
{"text":"Andrew was the shit. Super good service and very knowledgeable with menu and restaurant. Gave us great suggestions on menu and drinks. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"First time here and the atmosphere is great. However, the service for everything was slow. We arrived at 5pm and glasses of wine took over 15mins each time we ordered. The first wine order had one glass wrong and the other wine had turned. The food took over 35mins for a salad and 3 side dishes. Two of the side dishes even came out cold. The food was just ok and they didn't offer any vegetarian entrees. For a healthy restaurant, they still catered to carnivores only. The lone bright spot was the Faroe Mac N Cheese"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant that feels like you are at the Sheridan poolside bar in Waikiki....thats the vibe I got. Loved the food and I thought the service was friendly and prompt. I came twice on my 3 day stay in AZ, loved the breakfast menu options. They also have wifi which is really nice. Not sure why they have received harsh reviews but I look forward to coming back and trying more of the menu when I am in town."}
{"text":"Beer was warm when it was finally received. Waiter seemed annoyed that we weren't eating. We chose not to based on his attitude,  though. He practically threw the check at us as he was walking by. No comment, thank you or even smile.  Waiter at the table next to us seemed really nice, though."}
{"text":"This place absolutely sucks. Brings Old Town down a couple notches. Terrible service - I mean I didn't leave a tip, and I've worked food service my entire life in the work force. She was rude; short with her speech and made no eye contact. It was not busy, and she seemed as though she had plenty of better things to accomplish rather than serve us well. This is the second time I've been here and received just miserable service. The trainee with another server looked afraid and quiet. Wondering what the employee turnover is like and if those people enjoy their jobs. After all, half of eating out is the experience. Won't ever waste my time or money here again - plenty of better places to eat within walking distance, and people far more deserving of my hard earned dollar."}
{"text":"All I can say is \"piss poor service\".  We ordered immediately when we sat down. It's 45min later and we still don't have food.   Asked the waiter and he said he'd check on it. He comes back and says the order was cancelled.  He didn't know why..."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. The energy, decor and service were perfect and the food was delectably fresh and delicious. Check this place out - it does not disappoint! We had the breakfast sandwich - egg was perfectly cooked, with nitrate free bacon and fresh avocado slices. The chicken sausage sweet potato hash was perfectly spiced and the sweet potatoes were still firm but not raw. We saw the blueberry protein pancakes at our neighbors table and we went for it. Kris was an impeccable server - attentive and engaging. I will be back and il telling everyone what a great place this is. :)"}
{"text":"Being from Texas I don't normally get to encounter such diverse food.. after reading the menu and nutritional benefits of all of the items on the menu I immediately altered my opinion of \"health food\". This was the most amazing meal I have ever had.  First off, Juliet walked me through me menu explaining all the different tastes I could experience in their restuarant. After ordering 75% of the menu, I am 100% positive that Juliet knows exactly what she is talking about, the food is AMAZING! Thank you Juliet and the wonderful experience at Farm and Craft.  I will most definitely be back, and I am considering moving to AZ just to see Juliets pretty face on a regular basis... Happy New Year. 2017 will be much better with FARM AND CRAFT in my life."}
{"text":"Wanted to go to the Chop House and ended up here. 30min wait to get a seat inside and 40min wait to get a kale Caesar salad and a turkey wrap? They really need to manage the kitchen better! People who have sat down after us have gotten their orders. Waiter came back and asked for my orders again and told me that they were very busy after 30min of seating here waiting. The kitchen being slammed is about the worst excuse I've gotten in years! You just can't use that after people after us have gotten their food. Nice manager came out and comped the meal...so this star is for her. Bad service, slow, loud music! You can decide if you are up for this experience!"}
{"text":"I love meeting here for lunch meetings. The open concept bar with outdoor seating is great. I usually order one of the fresh pressed juices, which are really good! The food is great as well. I love that their food is mainly local grown, organic, grass-fed, non-gmo, etc. It sometimes seems like I'm more excited about this place than the staff is. I typically end up telling my guests about the menu and the history of the restaurant when the servers don't."}
{"text":"Worst bar service ever.  Blonde bartender checked her phone more then she waited on customers."}
{"text":"Really clever menu and great location.  Drinks fun  it slow slow service and trying to be too creative with kids menu.  Fix the service and could be great."}
{"text":"Great ambience. Modern, upscale interior. Friendly staff. Had the steak sandwich for lunch and have to say it was one of the best I've had in awhile. I will be back."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. Slowest service ever. And order was brought out backwards; entrees, drinks, shared plates. There were grapes in the spinach artichoke dip which was not a pleasant surprise. The juices and coconut cold brew were great though."}
{"text":"We loved this place! Great tasting healthy food. Our son has celiac and he has a great experience. Cool vibe and nice staff. We we visiting on vacation and had two dinners here it was so good."}
{"text":"Five stars no question asked, the food is amazing here and the price for what you are getting is damn good, I love The atmosphere and the customer service, food is amazing, I'm from San Diego and I'm very picky when it comes for food quality."}
{"text":"This place has been calling my name. I live close and am all about organic whole foods. We had a large group (15) celebrating a birthday. My husband doesn't usually like this type of food (yeah, healthy lol) but he really dug the sweet potato hash. He was shocked lol. I had the spinach, black bean bowl and asked for eggs on the side so I can give to the husband (because originally he thought he was going to starve due to no substance) The waitress was spot on. Filled our glasses every time when running low. It did take awhile for the food to come out. Some of our group who ordered last had gotten their food right when the peeps who ordered first had just finished theirs. We did separate checks, and put it towards our big group. Not normal. I will def be back. The only grip is the pets. Which looked to only take place outside, thank goodness. People are allergic to pet dander, so I don't really understand the bring your pet to a relaxing get out breakfast where others are around. I love my dog, and we get out. But not at eating joints. Bars maybe."}
{"text":"I had passed by this restaurant for several nights before checking it out and now I'm kicking myself because it's SO GOOD. I had the subtly spicy sweet potato and blue cheese flatbread, the spinach and goat cheese salad with steak, and Brussels sprouts with bacon and walnuts. I wanted more but this was already more than I could eat, and man am I looking forward to the leftovers. Great food, fair price, delicious cocktail and excellent service."}
{"text":"I like this place. Especially the farm mural on the wall. Food is healthy and delicious."}
{"text":"Okay so I'm writing this update because the menu has changed...  I liked the build your own in the previous menu but they no longer have it as an option, I was sad. Andrew saved the day, he told me that they can still put together my favorite of steak, broccolini and brussel sprouts. I ordered a Patrick as always. He has seriously been pleasant from the second he greeted us.   I came in the next afternoon to grab a few Patrick's before I hit road, he was there to greet me. I truly appreciate the customer service here.   Thank You!!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday afternoon and had Amanda as our server. She gave great recommendations and was able to answer any questions we had. She was very attentive and has a great personality. The flat iron steak is my new favorite here. Shout out to the kitchen for the amazing flavor in the mac n cheese and flat iron steak. Thank you for the great experience!"}
{"text":"The food is very good, but still pretty pricey for breakfast for two.  I understand it's old towns, but if it was a little cheaper this place would be booming!"}
{"text":"Really did not enjoy this place. Went for lunch one day. The person at the counter did not know anything about the menu and, rather than asking someone with more knowledge, gave false information. I ordered the breakfast toast dish. I asked if it was like a french toast and she said yes. It came out as an overly thick piece of dry toast with cheese, strawberries, and an overpowering amount of herbs on it. My wife ordered a chicken dish which lacked any semblance of flavor or even salt on it. The piece of chicken was the only edible thing on it. It was way overpriced for the flavorless food we got."}
{"text":"Today I'm having the breakfast burrito with sweet potato great place service is great so far the best in Arizona"}
{"text":"awesome place! really great concept and the food was so fresh and the staff was very friendly and answered all of our questions. our bartender suggested the farro mac and cheese and the steak bowl, both were so good and filling. i am excited to go back for brunch and try the breakfast and the awesome sounding bloody marys she told us about."}
{"text":"Went at lunch time with my wife.  We were told they did not have anything available for 30 to 45 minutes.  Then as we left - they seated two ladies at a two top who were behind us in line.  Not cool!"}
{"text":"My husband has been wanting to try this place. We decided to go at lunch on a Saturday. We have recently quit eating meat and found their menu didn't have a lot of choices for lunch/brunch. We got the Greek quinoa salad and the avocado hummus. LOVED the hummus. Pita was ok salad was good. Service was on the slow side and the kitchen was a little backed up."}
{"text":"Doesn't close at 10 as advertised. Drove across town and walked in at 8:50 just to be told they were closed. They have good food but that was frustrating"}
{"text":"Now that I'm back in New York in the freezing cold I'm literally dreaming of this patio. Great location, very open-air set up with cute, trendy decor. They have some great drinks on tap including rose! The happy hour is excellent with a mushroom flatbread and avocado hummus that I devoured.  Their best item by far, though, is the kombucha cocktail. I had the kombucha and cucumber and it is now my favorite drink of all time! So refreshing, tasty and pretty! It's only $8 during happy hour.  I wish they would have had this place when I lived in Phoenix! I will definitely be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Trendy cute brunch spot with lots of healthy and fresh options-- we weren't there for happy hour but seems like a good spot for that! Some outdoor seating. They even had wine on tap!"}
{"text":"Gross and over priced. My breakfast was cooked all wrong and they burnt my toast. For 35 bucks and I have to order and get my own coffee, not worth it. I'll give two stars because I do like the outdoor seating. The location would be better for someone serving comparable food. Also no Bloody Mary at a brunch location."}
{"text":"First things first, the interior here is impeccable and perhaps the most stylish I've seen for a place that's casual. It's extremely cute and the perfect shades of colors with designs to compliment. I came here for lunch on vacation and the girl who greeted me was very welcoming and energetic. Polite as can be and offered her favorite choices. She recommends the Chicken Bowl with a Hydrator drink. It was delicious. The quinoa paired with avocado blended perfectly together, the chicken wasn't dry and you could taste the grill work done on it, and the edamame salad was couple with cheese underneath. Mouth watering to look at and to taste. The drink, I have no idea what was in there, but holy. It got me a little tipsy. It was fruity and tasty, something perfect on a hot day in Arizona. I included some pictures of the interior and food, it's a must go if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Ended up here for happy hour & ordered the avocado hummus, bbq pizza, and bf got cocktail on a watermelon. Loved the decor very cute and trendy, but the food just wasn't great. Avocado hummus was sour, bbq pizza isn't worth noting, and my bf's cocktail wasn't really a cocktail as there wasn't much room for the actual drink inside the watermelon. Our server was friendly, but she openly told us she was applying for other jobs.. you can interpret that as you want. We asked her for more carrots for our avocado hummus and she took 15 minutes to get us back 6 carrot sticks. I was hoping our experience would be different because I just love how cute this place is, but overall just wasn't impressed with the place."}
{"text":"....no words just emojis! (Oh I have to add more words to post this review lol)  Farm and Craft had Great food, great ambience, and great service!! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Atlanta and it was my second day in Scottsdale.  My friends and I were walking and exploring the city and decided to stop in and have some drinks.  The staff was very friendly and greeted us immediately upon walking in and it was quite busy.  We decided to sit at the bar side patio because it was nice day. The cocktails were amazing but the bartender Jody was absolutely phenomenal.  Jody's service along with her drinks are just amazing. Very knowledgeable about the food, beverages and things to do in the area. Over all I am extremely happy I came here and everyone should check out Farm and Craft and say hello to Jody."}
{"text":"Had the Thursday night flatbread and bottle Of wine deal. The chicken and kale pesto flatbread was delicious!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food actually! The lasagna was very average, the sweet potatoes poor, the Brussel Sprouts average. The drinks were good."}
{"text":"Absolutely in the love with this place!! First time here and it was outstanding. Our server was Alexis, it was her first day?! We couldn't even tell, she was on top of her game. She knew every detail regarding the menu, and what's in every dish. The food was amazing!! The pineapple and bacon flatbread, OH MY!! The atmosphere was beautiful! Such a cute place for a date night! I can't wait to come back   Thank you Farm and craft for such a wonderful evening"}
{"text":"Fabulous service but everything else was meh to bad. The steak bowl came out with charred, overlay cooked and basically cold steak. Not a lot of it either. The poke bowl has zero flavor so I asked for soy sauce. I thought the kombucha cocktails were just okay too."}
{"text":"I can't believe anyone would rate less than 5 stars for this place! Being from San Diego there are a ton of health conscious options available and not one I've tried can compare to this cute establishment. The food is sooooo good. We ordered the grass-fed burger which comes with a side of mixed greens, a side of brussel sprouts (best ones I've ever had) and a side of sweet potato hash. To die for! To top it off their drinks were top notch especially the kombucha and bourbon. I can't rave enough about this place. Must try!!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try out Farm & Craft because of their healthy menu and the overall look of the restaurant. I went there on a Saturday afternoon around 2:30 pm with 2 friends. Surprisingly, they weren't busy as it was quite nice out. We quickly placed our orders of 3 entrees, no drinks. Our food didn't come out for 36 minutes! No reason, no apologies, no explanation. Starving, we ate our food: a salad, pancakes and avocado toast. It was very good!  However, our waitress never came back to refill our waters or to check in on us. They only time we saw her again is when she gave us our bill. When she came back, we discovered that she charged us the wrong bill amount and had to do it do a refund and run the card again for the correct amount. But at least she apologized that time! It was a very disappointing experience. While the food and atmosphere were nice, it wasn't nice enough to make me want to come back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with my wife and have even stopped in solo while traveling for work. They have a great vibe a dinner date or just to hang out and get some dinner and a glass of wine.  LOVE the greek salad.  One of my favs!"}
{"text":"To start the bartender Devon had the personality of a turtle.  No intensity, no emotion.  I had to asked if we could order and for her to wipe off the bar. We got our food, we both had the same thing a tortilla wrap, one of the tortillas was completely burned. I Sent it back they brought it back more burnt than the first time.  Second time When they brought  it back I opened it up and they just flipped the tortilla over!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of meeting the staff and sampling the food on Friday.   The nachos with chicken sausage and black beans was very good.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"I went to this place farm and craft on a weekend and ordered the kumbatcha drink/cocktail. Oh my goodness it was delicious and refreshing. I even went to the grocery store after and tried to remake the drink myself. Now thats a good drink! For the record it wasn't as good as the restaurants. The food is pretty decent and priced normally. It is more of a organic/healthy restaurant so expect the gluten-free and such trends."}
{"text":"Very good dinner.  Steak was tender and flavorful.  Caesar salad with kale and shaved Brussels sprouts with a generous piece of salmon was too big to finish.  Cocktail with fresh squeezed juices were a well balanced compliment to the meal."}
{"text":"Awesome creative food, great setting and totally super service! What a find!  We came here twice on a recent visit to Scottsdale.  Had a great time and service both times - loved the healthy but adult beverages and the healthy nachos.  BTW the paleo brownies were a great finish to the meal :)"}
{"text":"Kitchen is slow as fuck!!! Excuse my language. I live in Denver (one of the best eatery states) ive been to plenty of small restaurants with amazing food but this is just embarrassing how slow the kitchen is here. Server was nice enough to offer free bottle of wine and drinks after over an hour wait for a table of 6 . (Update) Over an hour and half without any food is honestly a joke. I've worked in plenty of kitchens and know how this business goes in and out. They don't have enough cooks for the capacity of customers they serve .  Owner should get this sorted out asap. Food came out and was amazing. Good food but need more cooks for your clientele."}
{"text":"The food at Farm and Craft is really good and the service we had and customer service (Manager Jesse) at Phoenix location was beyond great. Thank you! Will go again, soon!"}
{"text":"Overpriced bad food! Waited 20 minutes a table before anyone came up. Typical Scottsdale, you're paying for good looking staff and Mediocre service!"}
{"text":"I reserve to revise in the future, as this restaurant just opened but my initial experience wasn't great. Came for dinner.  Music was waaayyyyy too loud. Annoying when you're trying to talk to your friends.  Deafness aside, I saw this new place recently when going to my usual healthy haunt next door, the Original Chop Shop. Oddly, both the menu and interior look like siblings, or at least first cousins. I'm sure Chop Shop is not pleased.   However, Farm & Craft has a bar and that will probably be a bigger draw then the food (at least at this point). Ordered one of the Bowls with chicken.  My friend ordered the same thing but with salmon. After eating we thought the portions were a little small but the deal breaker was the overwhelming taste of SALT. Both dishes we had were sodium overload. How can you lure customers in as a healthy option but slowly kill them with salt????  We both felt like we drank a glass of the Pacific Ocean. Yuck.  Atmosphere is better then Chop Shop and the outdoor seating and bar are cool but given the cost and actual food, I'd go to Chop Shop or drive to Flower Child or True Food if I want to know I won't leave saline-ed and will get a true organic experience. I'll give it another shot in the future.  Cool spot and bar but food needs some tweaking. Kudos for bringing a potentially healthier option, but why next door to an already great and guaranteed healthy place???"}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place. I came here and ordered the Brussel sprouts and mac and the faro mac and cheese. Please don't miss it. Wonderful service. Amazing flavors. I read the reviews and I have to disagree because they said its lacking flavors. As soon as you put the first bite of these two items I ordered they exploded in my mouth! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Toast was god damned perfect. None of that flimsy garbage that rips or bends when I spread jelly on it, oh no. This toast had integrity. Crispy enough to satisfy my need for those sitting next to me to be able to hear the crunch it produces, but not burnt and bitter. Extra points for the fact that it didn't scratch the roof of my mouth. The head chef, Collin, is the man and if I could have him make toast for me every morning, I probably would, and then I'd give him a crisp high five once I finished the first bite to let him know he's done a stellar job. Coffee was pretty good too"}
{"text":"Six of us went for  Sunday brunch.  Great cocktails all hand crafted with care ,food was fresh and natural a little  on the bland  side but we all  liked our food. We are all healthy food eaters. Service was  slow but that to be expected  with real food. I would say  my  only real complaint is the music volume was so  loud we  had a hard time hearing each other. I would  probably think  of another choice if I wanted to visit with friends while eating next time. The  women next to us  were both on their mobiles so they didn't seem to mind ."}
{"text":"Come here for a fun/hip atmosphere and yummy food! The Strawberry & Goat salad is perfect if you want a light refreshing meal (I added chicken). My mom ordered the Sweet Potato Hash with Chicken Sausage and I thought it was a delicious and unique brunch option. The secret stash drink was yummy also, refreshing!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I came for a date night meal.  The Blueberry Health Shot (martini) was spot on delicious!  We aplit the avacado hummus and lasagna bolegnase.  The hummus was very bland.  Not even much avacado flavor.  But the lasagna was AWESOME.  So good it made up for the boring hummus!!  Rich flavor, perfect spice blends, just superb!!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent Farm and Craft quite often and always enjoyed the food, service and ambiance - but over time, the shine has tarnished. It's as though they willingly go out if their way to drive away potential customers.  1. A few weeks ago, I brought a few health-oriented friends who were excited about their menu and eager to try their food. We park a block away and hear this god awful auto-tuned club music blaring. It sounded like chainsaws and wood chippers set to a beat. I joke that the W pool party must be raging, but as we get closer, it's coming from Farm and Craft! We are young, we like music, but this was SO LOUD and obnoxious total crap music blaring that it was downright hilarious.  The music literally pushed us all away and we disappointedly went elsewhere for brunch.  2. A friend and I were craving grass-fed burgers and we've always liked the ones served at Farm and Craft.  As we walk to door, we see several open tables both outside on the patio as well as inside. The host informs us there is a 15 - 20 minute wait. What?  Open tables all clean and set with silverware and yet we must wait? We left and went elsewhere.   Basically, I want to eat at Farm and Craft, but the damn place keeps pushing me and my friends away.  Now I go to Modern Market just down the street because they are always up for serving healthy food to willing customers."}
{"text":"Disappointed Took 1/2 hr to get our artichoke dip to share. Came with small handful of chips and six old carrot slices Regret not taking a photo $12"}
{"text":"Food is good and the decor is nice but it's incredibly loud due to the wood floors and exposed ceilings, but it is very beautiful. My main issue is that they are marketing themselves as a sustainable, healthy restaurant but no one seems to know why exactly the salmon is labeled as \"sustainable\" and the menu labeling for different health options is just over the top and bizarre. If your theme is healthy and sustainable you should at least educate your staff on what that means. Their marketing has outpaced their reality."}
{"text":"I ate their last night.  The decor is excellent.  Our waitress Chrystal was also very friendly and helpful. The food was awful-tasteless.  I had the flatbread with chicken, artichoke, etc.  It had no taste at all.  The chicken was dried out.  My cucumber vodka drink was also watered down with everything but vodka. Also they would not put the misters on despite our asking and very warm weather.  Crazy.   No I won't be back."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. The menu makes my little healthy heart happy with the explanations of benefits in eating every dish. I am a vegetarian and find there to be plenty of options for me, though sometimes just requires asking the server if an item can be modified! The artichoke dip is seriously amazing. I was a bit hesitant about the cranberries in it before ordering but they really bring this dish together! Mushroom flatbread is always beautifully prepared with fresh ingredients. I enjoy the spicy broccolini. Happy hour has great food & drink deals. Cocktails are delicious here. My favorite is a hard tie between the kombucha habanero and spicy watermelon. I love a spicy drink!! The watermelon is perfect for a hot summer day and makes for a refreshing snack + drink - did I mention the drink is served inside half of a personal watermelon? A must visit spot if you're a health nut like myself!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is really cool and the interior is beautiful. I came here for lunch with a friend and our food took over 30 minutes to come out. I was excited to start eating my lunch when I noticed a hair in my food. I've worked in the service industry before so I know this happens (even though it shouldn't). What bugged me the most is that none of the managers bothered to come over and apologize for the hair, that's the least someone could have done."}
{"text":"Great vegan choices but lots of other things too. Bowls are good; nice wines. A little too noisy for anyone without good hearing."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place! The build-your-own option is so great, especially for the health conscious. I did that with tofu, broccolini & a side salad :) I definitely will be hitting that place up again"}
{"text":"I went to Farm & Craft for Sunday brunch based on a friend's suggestion and I cannot stress how glad I am that we went there.   Okay, so if you're going to Farm & Craft expect healthy breakfast and lunch items on the menu along with smoothies (and cocktails, of course!).   To start off, I ordered the 'Forbidden Fruit', which is a vodka drink served inside a grapefruit. Apparently, it is their signature drink, however, I wasn't really impressed. I think that drink was gone in like 3 or 4 sips.   For my meal, I ordered the sweet potato hash with chicken sausage. O-M-G! It was so good, the meal was filling yet light. I ordered a mimosa to go along with my meal.... because... hey it is brunch after all!   If you're going for brunch, just a WARNING, there might be a bit of a wait. They'll take down your name & number and contact you once a table becomes available.   Overall, great service and they are extremely attentive. I noticed they had Kombucha cocktails, which I didn't get to try, however I am planning to on my next trip. This s a GO TO if you're visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I love this place.  This venue was amazing. I love the fact they have healthy food options.  The food was very delicious.  The PROTEIN TOAST I had was amazing.  So flavor full.  I was visiting Scottsdale and wish we had this type of restaurant in the bay area.  They also serve freshly squeezed juices as well."}
{"text":"Came here looking for Paleo food during my recent trip to Scottsdale - was not disappointed - they have kombucha drinks and the food was great!  Love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"So disappointed.  Everything undercooked and under seasoned.  Took 25 min for three bowls to arrive.  All three of us had raw veggies and crispy quinoa .   Only positive was atmosphere and energy in the place.  Might be a great spot to grab a drink but don't waste your money on food here."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for our first time. Ordered a burger, among 4 other meals. When the burger came to table I cut into it and started eating it. Soon, I had pieces that were not undercooked...but raw. Raw, like the meat you buy at grocery store and take home to cook. Not all of it was raw, but there was enough of it that I couldn't eat it and had to send it back. They did reheat it, but didn't even offer to take any part of it off the bill. Oh well, many more places in Scottsdale I can go."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there last night.  I'm less into \"health food\" type restaurants than she is.  The physical setting is nice and the interior is bright and well designed.  The patio being right on 7the th can get a little loud but hey, that will be true of any patio on 7th. Food: Generally good.  The spinach and artichoke appetizer was ok, good not great but I usually don't expect much from appetizers.  I had a drink, the Cure which was tasty, but at $10 a bit steep (but following a trend in Phx).  My wife had a the Macha Mule (she had never had Macha before) and very much liked it.  For entrees I had the salmon poke bowl.  Very good with fresh ingredients and well presented in a bowl.  My wife had the lasagna.  I tried it and I agree with another reviewer that is was average.  We also ordered two sides.  She had the grilled Brussels sprouts, good but not the best.  I had the beets with wasabi.  Clearly the best thing that we had.  Beets are an acquired taste.  The wasabi/cream topping made this side outstanding AND it was a large portion. I also ordered a beer for dinner (a McFate brew).  The beer list could use some more local beers.  Finally as other reviews have suggested the service needs some improvement.  We initially had two servers until they clarified who was our server.  It took a while for my drink (and the place wasn't that busy).  Somewhat faster with entrees but still not the speediest.  Finally we waited a while for our check because our server was having a long and engrossing conversation with another table next to us.  That typifies the friendly but disorganized service.  It seems that's the major improvement needed at Phx Farm andCraft (in a VERY competitive location)  My wife will be back but me, not so sure."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding. The Kumbucha vodka drink with cucumber was delicious. I loved the salmon bowl with roasted vegetables. We will definitely return. The service was not great but the food more than made up for it."}
{"text":"Stopped in with mom and two teenage daughters.  Honestly I didn't know what to expect. All four of us loved it.  Really the best food I have had in Old Town Scottsdale in sometime.  I'm not a foodie but my meal was fantastic. Great waiter too."}
{"text":"Checked out Farm & Craft tonight and was a bit disappointed. It was my first time here and mainly because of restaurant week.  The reservation was for 4 people at 6pm. When we arrived our friends were already there so we seated ourselves with them.   Interior has a super cool vibe. It's very laid back and relaxing. Reminded me of original chop house just a bit. We ordered drinks and looked over the menu. We got the 3 course deal as part of restaurant week and the grass fed burger. Upon checking in I also received a free avocado dip.   The grass fed burger was not bad, but nothing really spectacular about it. The bbq chicken flatbread was decent but the bread was too hard. Perhaps a little too done.   In regards to the food it was honestly just ok. I would have given Farm & Craft 4 stars but the  service is what dropped it another star. We waited a long time with empty glasses. When the water was refilled it was warm. The wait to get my beer was quite long as well. When I did receive my beer it was the wrong one. Finally it was time for the check. When the check arrived it was wrong. I had an extra beer on there and we were charged for a drink that should have been a part of the menu for restaurant week. We pointed it out and it was corrected.   In summary the food is not bad but the service was."}
{"text":"I was here today and love so much about this place! It's got a very modern and cute ambiance, got a table right away (at 11am on a Sunday even), the service is fabulous, and the food is amazing (and healthy). Loved it! The only reason why not five stars is the music is so loud you definitely find yourself having to kind of shout and say \"huh\" with people your trying to catch up with. Nice music, but people want to have conversation while their eating at your fabulous place too. You sign says \"All I want is food and affection.\" Well the affection part needs to happen there while shouting! Lol. That is the only negative though...great over all! Glad I went!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful 'see and be seen' hip kind of place. You'd think you were in LA. And no wavering on those New Years resolutions! At this place you don't have much choice - it's all healthy! Poke bowl and iced tea were both delicious. Only 4 stars as service seemed a little unorganized for those not sitting at the bar. But I would stop by again!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and had the farmhouse flatbread and the steak sandwich. The food has been delicious and the lemonade at lunch was tasty as was the IPA I had at dinner. I haven't seen any problems with the service, although it varies depending on the time... at dinner the servers come to your table while at lunch you order at the counter and they bring you your food.  My only complaint would be that the music is loud and the acoustics are bad so that it is almost impossible to have a conversation at your table, It's definitely not a place to have an intimate meal, but if you want something healthy, hip, and happening, Farm and Craft is a great addition to Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Service is super friendly, but the breakfast was pretty mediocre.  Had the egg white, kale, and sweet potato hash and the potatoes were pretty undercooked.  Maybe it was an off morning."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday afternoon for lunch because I was craving something healthy, and this place hit the spot. I got the kale caesar salad with chicken and didn't have to feel guilty because even the dressing is made with healthy alternatives - but you won't notice a difference in taste! I love the decor, \"All I want is food and affection\" is my new life motto. The service was fast, even on a busy afternoon. I would take off 1/2 a star for the price, Scottsdale is expensive, but $4 for a small iced tea is absurd."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, service was great. Even got to speak with the manager who was very approachable and friendly. Top notch treatment.. definetly coming more often!"}
{"text":"I'd give it a 3.5. The decor and atmosphere are amazing but the food is a little simple/bland. It's an order at the counter and take a seat kind of place so that's always a plus. We went for weekday breakfast/brunch and I was happy with it but I don't know that I would file it in a \"must come back to\" restaurant."}
{"text":"Not that great overall and food is mediocre at best. If you ask what their best cookie is the server is likely to tell you he doesn't know because he's vegan. As though you actually care what his diet is! So dumb!"}
{"text":"I have been multiple times for breakfast and it is great. In addition the staff is friendly, the breakfast sandwich is fantastic and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Great food. I'm Gf and Vegan and it's catered to that. Love love love"}
{"text":"Not a huge breakfast menu but I must say the 2 items we ordered were delicious and could have been the only 2 items on the menu as far as I'm concerned. The protein pancakes for my guy and I got the breky burrito. I managed to get a bite of the pancakes before they quickly disappeared off of his plate and wow! I'm a little more picky/healthy so I got the burrito and the best part, as soon as we sat down the server said, we will make what ever you want how ever you want ... music to my ears. I dont eat meat so I took out the bacon and chicken and replaced with tofu and avacado, with egg whites and light cheese. I was still shocked at how delicious and flavorful it was. The staff was great as well and I'm super happy with my experience."}
{"text":"I really love the vibe of this place. I really enjoy the rustic salmon bowl and the fresh juices they make in-house. Their craft cocktails are up there with my faves too. I come to Scottsdale a couple of times a month for work and I always make sure to eat here. It's usually a fun place no matter what day of the week."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy eating!  The Greek Quinoa bowl with Salmon is very fresh, light and delicious. My wife had the protein toast, also very good."}
{"text":"I am skeptical of healthy places as the food is often odd or lacking flavor but this place is not that at all. Had the steak sandwich and the \"healthy\" coke and both were excellent. My wife had the Rustic salmon bowl which she also loved. Host/wait staff was also very friendly. Will be coming back..."}
{"text":"Very nice setting, decor is great and interior design is very welcoming. Staff were more interested in catching up with each other's stories from the bar the night before than serving the patrons, but other than the slow service they were very friendly. Food was okay, serving sizes were very small though... My acai bowl should have been about 50% bigger than it was. My wife's protein toast was passable at best: scrambled egg was cold, toast wasn't toasted through so was soggy, and there was a paltry amount of avocado spread on the toast. It wasn't bad, but I probably won't be back, there are much better places to eat in Old Town Scottsdale..."}
{"text":"Probably one of our favorite places in old town. Great cocktails and healthy food. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Love love love Farm and Craft. Great healthy menu and completely IG worthy. Whenever I have company I  make sure to take them here and they absolutely love it! Defiantly give it a try."}
{"text":"This is for the healthy folks!  Interesting stuff and tasty. Paired with a full bar it was a very nice experience. I eat healthy but drink too much beer so it may have been designed with me in mind!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after looking over the menu they posted on their website. I love the concept of fresh ingredients that are healthy and sustainably sourced. The \"cold pressed\" cocktails and juices looked amazing!   After walking in I first noticed the modern and fun decorations, followed instantly by the insanely loud music. It was RIDICULOUS how loud it was and I couldn't even hear the person next to me. After being there for 5 minutes, we had enough and our party of 6 walked out. We apologized to the server, who mentioned she too thought it was too loud and had mentioned it to the manager, but to no avail. Their \"about\" section on their webpage states that after 5pm, they turn down the lights and offer a full dining experience. Perhaps they should consider turning down the music as well."}
{"text":"We came in on a saturday morning for breakfast and had a hard time deciding what to order. There are so many healthy options!  We decided on the chicken sausage scramble and the protein pancakes. The chicken sausage scramble tasted fresh and healthy, and I loved that they had sweet potato in it too! If you want more spice, I recommend adding cholula hot sauce -- it was soo good. The protein pancakes had blueberries in the middle and were drizzled with strawberries and granola. They were a little dry but amazing with the syrup. The pancakes themselves were very filling and we couldn't finish them.  My one thing was that their tap kombucha wasn't that great that day.  I'm not too familiar with kombucha, but my friend has had several types and didn't like theirs. Hopefully that was just us!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. Waited nearly 20 minutes after being sat to get waited on. Proceeded to order a fresh press juice. 5 minutes later the server returned to tell me they were out of all of their juices. This was at 1pm...Yikes. In addition very warm in here... a/c broken perhaps? Food was ok but not enough to make this a one and done experience for me. Good luck to you should you decide to eat or drink at Farm & Craft."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot in Scottsdale right now, been here few times already for brunch/ lunch and dinner. Food is pretty good, the avocado hummus is a must try .. Their salmon and steak bowls are phenomenal, burger also was delicious and just perfect. Drinks are good as well( unless you are not a big fan of kombucha) and their \"health\" Rx shots deserve trying for sure. Overall, excellent spot and concept. Will be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"They never brought me my whole order. We were finished eating before they even noticed. 30 min to get yogurt, pancake and eggs. BTW, there were maybe 4 busy tables. Protein pancakes are just pancake batter and blueberries... I had high hopes for this cute patio location. On to the next."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is fantastic! Avocado toast is amazing. The flatbread and bottle of wine is a great and delicious deal! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Where to start.  The only thing worse then waiting 35 minutes for a glass of house red is to pay more  for the glass than my entree, that took almost an hour. The place was half empty but we couldn't even talk to one another over the pumped in noise. Limited menu, too expensive for the venue and dreadful service.   Wonder why it was half empty on a Saturday night?  Don't.....  this is why."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh and clean breakfast. Staff is friendly and good looking. Food was good and the juices are super tasty. My brother and I were planning on going to the breakfast club across the street but they had a 30 minute wait and we were pressed for time. We walked over to this place instead. It was perfect. It's not your typical American \"overflowing breakfast plate\" so if that is what you are looking for you will be disappointed. But for those with a more refined palette this is a great find."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing. The avocado hummus had the perfect avo taste and the cauliflower was such a nice additions instead of celery! I got the raw pad Thai it is the most perfect summer salad. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Went here for the build your own bowl and got the grass fed steak and Brussels sprouts and a glass of wine. Unfortunately, money NOT well spent. My steak came out so cold as if they have extras sitting back there waiting to be ordered. The servers were so out of focus. No utensils were brought and my wine literally got filled a quarter of the way... mind you I've come here before during lunch time and ordered the same dish and drink and they were fine before. The service was so uninviting and I can't say I'll be back. For the prices charged the service and quality of food should match."}
{"text":"Tasty place. Kind of similar to a lot of other spots but pretty well done. The best item of the night was the rustic salmon bowl. That was definitely delicious. The lasagna was decent but not anything to get excited about. The avocado hummus was tasty. All the cocktails were more of a \"light and refreshing\" style, but pretty good for what they are. Overall a solid spot but nothing I'm dying to get back to."}
{"text":"I just love this place! It has great food, the specialty drinks rock & the atmosphere is perfect! Hats off to the wait staff as well. Grady, thanks for the 5  service & I am  looking forward to seeing you next time I dine at Farm & Craft!"}
{"text":"I dined here with a large group for a late brunch and we all enjoyed different items off their menu. I'm a big poke fan so when i saw the three poke options i chose my favorite, the Salmon Poke Bowl. It was delicious and a nice size of salmon was included. I absolutely loved this entree! The location of this restaurant and the open feel was great, as well. Our server was a little inattentive and didn't return very often but when other servers walked by and we flagged them down they would return quickly with the drinks or items we needed so that helped."}
{"text":"Not because of food. READ ON! First time we went, I loved my food and drink. Husband was less impressed, but I think it was what he ordered.  Saturday night, he agreed to give it another shot. Website says they are open until 10pm. We arrived at 845pm.  A young lady asked if we had been helped and we asked for a table on the patio for two. She said, \"Ok, but just so you know, we're going to close at 9p tonight.\" Me- What does that mean?? You need us to leave by 9p? Her-\"Yes, preferrably. I mean, you can get a drink, but you won't have time for food. If you want food, there are a couple of other restaurants down the way that are open, you can go down there to Stock and Stable or The Bevy.\" Oh my gosh, REALLY??  My husband asked for clarification on their hours and she talked in circles saying that it depends.. and when he asked that if they close at 9p, does that mean they stop seating at 830p, 8p, do they expect everyone to be gone at 9p? She again said, it depends on what they want, but yes, they would actually be closed/gone at 9p or shortly after.  I give this place 6months tops and they'll be out of business!   Seriously, do I have to go into how wrong this is on SO many levels?"}
{"text":"Great environment, decent food, and dog friendly. We had a pretty good experience until all of our food came out and a woman (I think a manager) informed me my protein pancakes were unavailable...as everyone else at our table was receiving their food. No problem;  I ordered a breakfast sandwich instead. The food was pretty good - we had two breakfast sandwiches and an avocado toast at our table. I highly recommend the House latte, which is delicious. When the bill came, my breakfast sandwich was not on the bill, so we figured it was comped, which we thought was super considerate of them and totally made up for the pancake problem. However, when our (super great until this point) server took the cash to get change, she brought back the change with a new bill with my breakfast sandwich now on it. This would have been okay since they never offered to comp the dish in the first place; however, the server  did not acknowledge the change. This really ended our experience on a sour note. What I thought would be a new Old Town favorite is now just another spot we aren't excited to return to."}
{"text":"While the aesthetic is nice and the lavender lemonade is delicious, the food and service left much to be desired. My chicken salad wrap was dry and the side \"salad\" didn't even have dressing on it! Way over priced and the staff seemed confused the whole time. Just go to Pita Jungle across the street."}
{"text":"So here's the thing: my coworkers and I came during the lunch rush, we were a pretty sizable party, and this place is just getting off of the ground--all things I kept reminding myself during our experience here. That being said, places don't really hang around for long in this area if they can't figure out how to do lunch quickly and well.  Being immediately greeted by the ordering counter upon walking in is a little overwhelming. I felt pressured to make a decision immediately, as the line can hold probably 8 people before it's right out the door and into the scorching heat. The \"build your own\" section was a bit confusing to me, as there was no elaboration as to how many things you choose for a plate. However, a staff member was over fairly quickly to explain how everything worked, and even to give a couple recommendations, which I always appreciate. Seeing as they had just opened, they weren't offering their full menu yet--completely understandable, but guests should be made more aware of that upon entry/being greeted rather than being told at the register.   The food is stellar, that much can't be denied. I built my own meal, choosing the roasted broccolini ($3), farro mac and cheese ($3), and grass-fed steak ($5). The steak was cooked to medium-rare perfection, though they never asked how I wanted it done, so this might be a problem for others who like theirs well-done. The farro mac and cheese surpassed all of my expectations, with some of the best cheese sauce I've had in recent memory. However, the name can be somewhat misleading, as farro serves as the \"mac\" in this dish. The broccolini was topped with red pepper and Parmesan and also surpassed my expectations. My only issue with the food here was the quantity. I'm a small person, it definitely doesn't take much to fill me up, but even I was left looking for something more to munch on after my meal. It's hard not to be slightly irritated to pay $3 for approximately 2.5 stalks of broccolini, regardless of how tasty it is.   As I mentioned, we had a big group dining here and it's a fast casual place, so we had pretty realistic expectations that we wouldn't all be served our food at the exact same time. But there's a bit of an issue when the first person doesn't receive their meal until probably 40 minutes after sitting down, and the last half dozen are so fed up with waiting over an hour after that, that they request their food to just be boxed up so they could take it back to the office and eat. The manager did come out and apologize, promising refunds for those few which was appreciated. Pro tip: you can't market yourself as a fast casual restaurant if you're not fast.  The other big issue we faced was with the service. Again, I tried to keep in mind that they were a brand new restaurant and everyone was still trying to figure things out. But it's hard for a girl to remain understanding when the misters on the patio are essentially a monsoon storm in and of themselves. We were sitting on the patio, having moved a few tables together to fit all of us in, and there were probably 6-7 misters pointing at only our table. We noticed right when we sat down that they seemed to be on pretty strong, but underestimated how soaked everything would get. We asked an employee after a few minutes of it would be possible to turn them down, and he agreed to speak to someone about it. Upon his return, he said that due to a \"technical error,\" there was nothing he could do about them. So in response, we explained that since we were the only table these were affecting, would it be possible to just have them shut off? I felt bad for the guy, really I did, but the look of exasperation on his face seemed unnecessary before he muttered a vague apology, repeated the technical error line, and said he'd see what he could do. I mean, all of our hair was drenched and matted to our faces, it was soaking the dishes that had arrived by then, and there were literal puddles of water on the tables. He returned and repeated the same line. A coworker went to speak to someone else about it, and had the misters shut off maybe 10 minutes later.   I love the farm to table concept, and the environment and brand that they've built is really great at capturing that idea. But it strikes me as odd that they'd choose to open right next to the Original ChopShop, which is an already well-established brand successfully executing the same general idea. For the quality of the food alone, I hope this place can quickly work out its kinks, but I'm not gonna hold my breath on that one. Until I hear someone I trust tell me that they had the best dining experience of their entire lives here, I likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Steak and soba. Dry and super salty. Took over 30 minutes to get served. Waitress- flirted with my bf with no regard to me. To be a good waitress... assume everything, include everyone (I was a waitress too... this just happens too often and is just awkward come on) Second time here so I tried. The first time my sweet potato side was completely burnt and still served to me. Turkey wrap is pretty tasteless. Pass on this place. Go to Bevvy 50 steps away, very good food and service there."}
{"text":"Kombucha drinks are super tasty, all the food is great and atmosphere is fun and hip!!"}
{"text":"LOVE!! Ate here for breakfast with 3 adults and 5 kids!!! Everyone enjoyed their food and the bill wasn't to bad either!!!  Love the decor and staff was very friendly. Would for sure come back again the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"The salmon quinoa bowl was perfect!!!   Fresh pesto, veggies, perfectly cooked salmon, and I added avocado.   The location is ideal and the ambiance is excellent."}
{"text":"All hype but didn't really deliver. Very hipster, not family friendly. Actually.... not that friendly at all. Their demographic is the early 20s crowd and wasn't very inviting with a family that has a 10yr old and a 63yr old. Went to brunch with the family and I was with my nephew,niece, and dad and they definitely did not treat us like the regular brunch going crowd that was hung over the day after partying. Food was ok but not that great. Keep it pushing... nothing special here."}
{"text":"Waited 55min for my food, there was only two of us. When I finally got my salmon bowl they forgot my side of cauliflower mash. The food was also luke   warm. Our server was very nice and brought us complimentary hummus, which is the only reason for the 2 stars. I will never come back"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Farm & Craft while walking down the street to Diego Pops. Don't let the name fool you. They have awesome drinks to sip on while hanging around. The watermelon and grapefruit drinks immediately caught my eye. I was scared it was just a novelty but they were both equally good. Beware of the grapefruit. It's so naturally sweet that you can drink the whole thing under 2 mins. Sit at the bar and watch the magic happen. Not too sure about the food there but stop by and grab a drink."}
{"text":"Yum! Awesome vibe, great food and super unique and delicious cocktails. Super friendly staff too. Can't wait to work my way through the menu, I could eat everything.  Mac n Cheese- check! Cali bowl- check! Wellness martini - check! Hummus and roasted veggie starters - check! Dessert - check! All so delish!!"}
{"text":"Really like the food and the \"healthy\" cocktails. like a flower child but with alcohol."}
{"text":"Today as my first time coming here and let me say the recommendations and reviews did not disappoint! I really liked the atmosphere, the service, the patio but most importantly the healthy yet delicious menu options. I had the Rustic Farm Salmon but and it was delicious, fresh and flavorful! I went during brunch hours, they did have happy hour drinks but they weren't much of happy hour prices I am use to but they were tasty. I recommend trying them out when you are in the old town Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. They weren't busy, but took an absurd amount of time to get an outdoor seat despite half of them being open. Once seated, I waited almost 15min to be asked about a drink order. When I finally got my beer, which was an unpalatable cloudy wheat thing, my waitress did return it, but I then waited another 10 min for a replacement. I ordered a flatbread as an app, and the lasagne as the dinner. They both showed up together, at the same time as the beer finally arrived.  None of them paired well together, so I gnawed threw for a bit and then said screw it and left.  Wish I would have trusted my gut and avoided anyplace on this strip of touristy low quality crap."}
{"text":"I appreciate a restaurant doing something different. I liked how the items on their menu was marked as to which different diets they followed. Great idea and original. I did have an issue but Kevin was gracious enough to reach out. I did genuinely enjoy my meal and really appreciate someone bringing delicious, healthy, organic meals to the table. I look forward to going back and becoming a regular."}
{"text":"I'll be back to try this place again, but I was slightly underwhelmed. This place just opened up on a pretty busy Scottsdale corner, it has a cute hip vibe. Think Flower Child but with alcohol and louder music. I came here for dinner with some girlfriends after a movie, nice end to a summer weekend.   I was hungry and ordered the chicken pesto flatbread and split the farro mac and cheese with a friend. The mac and cheese is sooo flavorful!!! It was really delish!! My chicken pesto flatbread was just okay -- good cheese, good chicken and fresh pesto, but I didn't care for thier whole wheat flatbread dough.  I know I know I know --- health food isn't always good, but it should be pretty tasty when I'm dining out. The dough really lacked flavor and I ended up just eating the chicken and pesto and mozz off of it instead.   I ordered the Kombucha and cucumber cocktail with vodka. Be warned, you could easily drink these without realizing there is any alcohol. They are light and refreshing and be potentially dangerous if you drink it too quickly. Hopefully you don't have too many, as they're $12/cocktail.  I also ordered the Rose all Day special, a $9 glass of rose wine that I really enjoyed. Apparently Sunday brunch its half off at $4.50/glass which is a real steal in my opinion. I'll def return to try that, as well as sample the brunch menu.  I want to try this place again to see if other menu items are worth my time, especially brunch.  The menu seems sort of limited, and I was disappointed in some of the bland flavors. The veggies are very fresh and the juices are wholesome.  I'm just not sure if it grades well with all of the other great options in the area. I'll keep you posted ;)"}
{"text":"Their drinks are so creative and are mixed really well! The broccolini and the artichoke dip were our favorites."}
{"text":"The Cesar Kale Salad was delicious! However if You order green juice They fill it half full with ice then charge you 8 dollars for less than a cup of juice! I asked for the ice to be taken out and that's what I was left with:-(    Order it without ice"}
{"text":"We visited Farm & Craft last night for dinner. The restaurant is in Old Town Scottsdale and we arrived around 7:15. There was a good crowd but it wasn't at capacity. The restaurant is designed very well. The decor was in a farm house modern design. The music was quite loud, had to strain to hear my dinner companions. There aren't any soft elements to the restaurant so the music seems quite loud. The staff is dressed casually, sneakers, tank tops (not my favorite) and it seemed all the men had long beards and tattoos. We ordered the chicken salad, a flat bread, and a kale caesar salad. The food is billed as organic, gluten free, good for digestion, etc. They offer a variety of craft cocktails with trendy ingredients, such as Kombucha. The plates, bowls, etc. are plastic. Jury is still out on whether I like this or not.  The flat bread was average, at best. I had the chicken salad. It was deconstructed. The flavors weren't memorable, rather bland. The best part was the pita bread made with flax seeds if I'm not mistake.  The service was comparable to a low end chain restaurant. Our waitress was competent but not memorable. Midway through the meal I needed another glass of wine, it look at least five minutes for our waitress to come by. I had to prompt her for another glass. It took another 5 minutes plus to receive the wine. I watched her check on another table, run a bill, chat with the bartender who wasn't doing anything, go to another table, go back to the bar, chat with the bartender, then my wine came out as I was finishing my meal. The waitress cleared half the table's plates, dropped my check directly under my hand as I was bringing up my fork to my mouth. Classy move. The service wasn't terrible but wasn't polished at all.   The overall experience was mediocre. If you're in the mood for a trendy, buzz word filled, bland menu accompanied by average service, I would recommend Farm & Craft."}
{"text":"First, I have to say that I really enjoy the food here. They have a great selection of food items and honestly I would eat here every day if it wasn't for the aggravation.   There seems to be some inconsistency with the food. Today I ordered from their website because I was in a rush and had to be at a meeting. I ordered the chicken with cauliflower mash because I am trying to adhere to a low-carb diet. Photo of menu below and what I actually got.  I get back to my office and open the box and instead of low-carb items, I have barley and high carb vegetables. Very frustrating since I skipped breakfast and basically either have to break the diet or skip it altogether.  Parking is not convenient and tough to find.  On this visit, I parked some distance away and halfway back to my car, I glanced in the bag and no silverware or napkins.  I had to walk all the way back to the restaurant.  Today was a frustrating experience on many levels."}
{"text":"Great restaurant to meet up for a casual lunch. The food was delicious and healthy, which is always a welcomed blend!"}
{"text":"Tried this place twice since I'm new to Scottsdale and all I can say is wow everything has been so fresh & delicious and the fresh healthy juices are amazing & all very tasty.. this place doesn't disappoint.."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait for this place to open! I finally was able to go and it was the best meal I've had in a while. I got the hummas and chicken salad appetizer and I can't even begin to tell you how good it was. I also got the avocado toast with the poached egg and it was so freakin good that I went back the next day and got it again. To end the meal I had an acai bowl and it was out of this world!!! I'm so so so excited to have another healthy restaurant right by my house!"}
{"text":"Nice place, great food, service was ver6 good. My only complaint...why is the music loud? I'm there with friends or family to talk and socialize, I'm not on a nightclub! I had to constantly lean close just to hear others talk...1 star for that part, 4 stars for the rest"}
{"text":"I was a little wary of this place at first and wasn't quite sure what to expect.  The staff was very friendly and helpful when we had questions about the menu.  The food was tasty and had good portion sizes for the price.  I also enjoyed the atmosphere and the laid back vibe.  An added bonus - they have kombucha on tap!"}
{"text":"This will be my new go to spot for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! Many restaurants can call themselves a healthy eating spot, but Farm and Craft actually delivers. Real quality foods that taste amazing! The Mac n cheese, avocado toast, and flatbreads are so yummy!! You can't go wrong with the pick three for lunch: sweet potato hash, Brussels sprouts, and carrots.. Add protein of your choice! Plenty of GF, vegan, and dairy free options.. And better yet, fresh ingredient cocktails! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Yum!!!! I mean really. Brilliant! Healthy, delicious, and a great environment. Riot Group sure does it right. Have to try the fresh press cocktails."}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch a few times and each time it's been delicious. There's a lot of health conscious options which is nice and the restaurant is very charmingly decorated. I really enjoy their protein toast which is their version of avocado toast. The toast is filling and flavorful and I keep coming back for it (I'll admit I'm a basic bitch sometimes). My husband had their pancakes this morning and they were some of the best pancakes I've had in a while, definitely recommend them if you're a pancake lover. My only complaint is that the music is ridiculously loud, the dining experience would be a lot more comfortable if they would just turn it down a notch."}
{"text":"*This review is for the loud music only. I will update it when I have an opportunity to eat here (and hopefully the music will be lower). I hate to be 'that girl' but i'm young and can totally handle a fun vibe, this was just too much.   We made a reservation to come here for our family birthday celebration and were SUPER excited to try their delicious healthy menu. My fiance's brother and his girlfriend are super clean eaters and vegetarian so they were stoked to try it. The ambiance is incredible. I love love it! Super trendy and hip.  However, the music. It. Was. So. Loud. I could not even hear the person next to me. We were shouting at each other. My fiance's mom and I are both prone to migraines and we just couldn't handle it so we had to leave and go somewhere else nearby. I was so bummed! Our waitress was very understanding and mentioned that she too thought the music was loud.   Make that easy change and we'll be back! ;)"}
{"text":"Five words: Almond Milk Coconut Cold Brew. Probably the best coffee I've ever had! This place is so cute and perfect for an organic, healthy snack or meal. We had the Breaky Burrito and Protein Toast. Both were delicious and the perfect amount of food.  The vibe was very relaxed and they also have a bar although no one was there since it was early."}
{"text":"When you first walk in the decor is beautiful. Love the large flower vase. Had the wellness martini while I waited for my friend to get to the restaurant. Pretty good. Server was nice but didn't acknowledge the table when my grind got there for like 15 mins when he talked to the table next to us 3 times. And didn't get the whole spiel like the other table did about what the icons meant but I figured it out myself. For my brunch entrees I got the protein porridge and pancakes unfortunately I couldn't purchase one pancake al carte and had to spend $10 just to eat one pancake and waste the other 2. And the don't do sugar free vanilla lattes only regular ones packed with sugar. My friend wanted the brioche almond butter banana but they ran out of brioche. So she had to order something else she really didnt want after driving all the way from alvondale to try the place out. She also ordered a glass of rose as asked for raspberries but they don't carry raspberries and she said that was fine no fruit because she's allergic to strawberries and she was brought a glass of rose with the one fruit she was allergic to... Strawberries. Very unimpressed porridge isn't really a porridge more like quinoa and fruit didn't eat it. Ate pancakes since porridge wasn't good, they were pretty decent. I might try lunch or an acai bowl, but brunch... Meh.  Update: Went to try a acai bowl, stood there for 10 mins because no one knew how to ring it up. Took 30 mins to get it because the crew that knew how to make it wasn't there, was made wrong the first time so it had to be remade and again forgot to put the strawberries on it. Was offered to have another one made after calling to tell them it was wrong but I had to go back to work. I was already there for 40 mins. Not satisfactions, probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Not appetizing, too cheap champagne to drink, raw vegetables served, and wayyyy too expensive"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a spot for brunch with a group of gal pals, a casual dinner date, or a post-workout light meal, look no further. Farm & Craft is the place for you! This restaurant has a fun, trendy atmosphere, friendly staff, and a deliciously health-conscious menu.   I ordered a kombucha-gin and the salmon poke bowl. The drink was fabulous. I don't often come across menus that offer such an extensively unique cocktail option, and the flavors in the drink were fruity and fun! The food was fresh, prepared well, and I felt really good while eating it. I would recommend the poke bowl to anyone who likes seafood in a heartbeat. I loved that there was enough salmon and avocado to have at least one piece in every bite!   The food and drinks are a little bit pricey, but I like to think that I'm paying for the overall experience, and a once in a while splurge is not a bad thing. I'd say that the general ambience, the cute atmosphere, good service and delicious food was worth every penny. We had a great time!"}
{"text":"Whenever my wife and I come in we are always seated promptly. It's good value for our money and I love the applewood smoked sausage. We go there often on the weekends. We love the patio! We are always checked on by seemingly every staff member in the building including the managers and we appreciate how friendly everyone is."}
{"text":"Really, really like this place! I love the ambiance and the music. The first time I came here, I was super pleased with what I ordered. I got the salmon with quinoa and veggies. The vegetables are fresh, the food quality is amazing. Also, another new favorite of mine is the Farro mac and cheese. This is probably my favorite kind of mac and cheese ever! Don't let the looks fool you, it's just that good. I mean, I could eat a whole big bowl myself. We visited this restaurant again today but I wasn't sold on their flatbreads. I wish I got the salmon instead. The smoothies are great too! If you like quality food, this is the spot."}
{"text":"We ordered the Avocado Hummus and salmon poke bowl and they were both good. The restaurant was  slow, we arrived around 4:15 PM but it took  long time to get the food. We ordered  fast but getting the food out took quite a while. We also ordered  the paleo brownie which was dry and lacking flavor."}
{"text":"My friends know that I'm into healthy eating, so they decided to take me here. I'm so happy they did! I ordered the berry protein smoothie and protein toast. The smoothie was pretty good, but that protein toast was crazy delicious. I had my friends try it and they loved it too. I had a piece of the salmon toast as well, and I might order that next time! The woman who took my order was extremely pleasant and friendly. If I lived in this area, I would definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"Food was okay; nothing special. Didn't appreciate the two flamboyant waiters wearing women's high heels and dancing around like it was Studio 54....real turn-off in terms of me going back there. There's hip and then there's in your face offensive behavior. Leave that behavior at home and be professional at work."}
{"text":"The pesto kale & chicken flatbread was seriously the best flat bread I've ever had! Service was amazing as well! Will tell friends & definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I go here at least once maybe more when I am in town which is often. Haley our bartender was super sweet. Food is always amazing! And the drinks!! So good. I always get The Cure and Happy Apple Bourbon are my 2 favs."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Service was sub par. Hoping it was because they were understaffed. We will go back and give it another try because of how good the food was- but we were disappointed with how slow the service was. On a positive note- the decor is clean and the flowers are beautiful."}
{"text":"I ordered the overpriced salmon dinner at 22 dollars for a super small portion of salmon over pureed peas.  The salmon was overcooked, tough and chewy on the top and bottom and had no seasoning. I returned it to the server who didn't have much to say about it and then didn't see her for most of the evening.  Ended up not ordering anything else because of the slow service.  Not one word about my messed up meal.  Glasses sat empty when we would have ordered more drinks.  Poor slow service, overpriced menu, small portions.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"I've ate at farm & craft before, didn't like it, so I decided to try it out again and try something new on the menu. To start off, the hostess had major attitude. Then we got seated on the patio, we ordered a quinoa salad add chicken, friend got the grass fed burger and a side of red sauce pasta. The server was so rude and did not want to accommodate for any of our needs. She had attitude as well, and it showed all over her face when we'd ask her things. I did not like what I had ordered, and she gave me the rudest look. Will never go there again. Chop shop is the way to go if you want a healthy meal and friendly service."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my last experience here. The kombucha cocktails were great but nothing can make up for the horrible service!"}
{"text":"Farm & Craft is one of my favorite healthy restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale. It's my go-to when I don't want to make my own healthy food at home, but need some good, clean food served to me. Not only the food, but the drinks here are amazing as well.   Food:  *Roasted Artichoke and Spinach Dip* with cranberry, served with gluten-free quinoa & omega flax chips & carrots- this appetizer is super delicious. Cheese is baked on top of the dip and makes your usual artichoke and spinach dip tastier. You get a healthy spin on chips for dipping with the flax chips and carrots.  *Avocado Hummus* BONUS!!---check into Farm & Craft on Yelp and get this $11 appetizer for FREE!! this hummus was made by mixing avocado, citrus vinaigrette, togarashi spice, and served with a flax pita & assorted fresh vegetables. I remember having cauliflower and carrots for the vegetables.  *Protein Toast* avocado toast with an egg  *Strawberry Apple AÃ§aÃ­ Bowl* smoothie bowl made using strawberries, aÃ§aÃ­, almond milk, topped with fruit, granola, and flax seeds or whatever seeds they have in the restaurant. I once got chia seeds, and another time had flax seeds.  Drinks:   *Alcoholic Kombucha* I ordered a kombucha with tequila in it and it was the perfect add-on to my Sunday brunch. You get the healthiness & hydration from the kombucha, but a nice buzz to keep you happy during brunch from the tequila ;)  *Strawberry Juice* strawberry, basil, honeydew melon, grapefruit & lime This juice is my favorite from Farm & Craft. So refreshing and tasty! The perfect drink to quench your thirst in this Arizona heat and not too sweet."}
{"text":"We got here about 1:00 on a Thursday hopping and loud! Bright and cheery place with wonderful outdoor seating ( our fav) we got the avocado hummus which was wonderful and the build your own bowl with chicken that was to die for and the mashed cauliflower and sweet potato hash all wonderful especially the hash!!"}
{"text":"I love the cocktails at farm and craft. They are creative, delicious and fresh. The fresh presses juices are also amazing. The good has always been high quality and tasty as well. The environment is nice, especially on the patio!"}
{"text":"The place looks great and there's great atmosphere  Thumbs up for the decor, bathroom very clean. Service was good ,we called and made reservations the table was waiting for us from here everything was not good. The pasta was cold and hard as a rock we had to send it back, the flat bread had no taste and cold it was like if it a pre made and they just shaved it into the oven. The steak bowl same like above cane cold the grilled vegetables had seen better days straight from the freezer. The deserts were not good as well. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"New menu options are totally delicious! Come to this place every time I come to town! Great service and great food. Try the tiramisu"}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place. Quite trendy, chic, and modern. Nice atmosphere, cute decor and set-up. A tad crowded though -- although crowded is a good thing when you have a business; it means your place is poppin'!   Started off our Friday night of shenanigans with a few close friends at the bar. Wasn't insanely busy, but definitely picked up as the night went on. Our bartender was super sweet and informative about their menu, drinks, etc. and was able to recommend drinks off the menu. I took his word for it and ordered the Wellness Martini. It was meh -- tasted more like a smoothie than a martini, and took quite a long time to get.   One of my friends ordered just tequila, lime, with a splash of grapefruit juice -- her signature drink... with NO simple syrup or agave, EVER! but the bartender snuck some agave in there... really, dude? Who does that? A girl knows what she wants; don't ever mess up a girl's chi with her drink. We saw him do it and then he wouldn't even admit to it, but he did remake it -- the way my friend ordered it from the get-go. (Not sure why guys don't like to listen???)   I know this place just opened so I'm still giving it 4-stars; it definitely has potential, but there are some \"kinks\" that need to be worked out for sure. And perhaps speed up the drink service? I know they're made fresh and \"with love\", but I was getting antsy waiting!"}
{"text":"Bland food! Bartenders hated their life rude and unavailable to everyone at the bar! They were happy chatting with each other but the patrons were neglected. So sad!  Great concept, big FAIL!!!!!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place before I went vegan... but now it is basically off my radar. originally I loved this place because the food is yummie/healthy and the menu is unique- by helping guests choose their meal based on what kind of food you want to put into your body and what you want to benefit from your meal! But now that I'm vegan there is barely any options for me to choose from! Which i find odd for a healthy restaurant... I do like their kombocha alcoholic drinks though!"}
{"text":"The food was good, I enjoy a healthy meal so it's nice to have this as an option. However, for the price, we ordered a $40 bottle of wine and two meals, roughly $75 for lunch I am going to have to demand actual silverware. I don't like using plastic knives and forks in general and trying to cut my chicken breast with plasticware was not ok. I would just take it to go next time and use my own silverware."}
{"text":"Over 30 minutes for a salad? I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant. I had heard good things and it's true the atmosphere is very nice open air bar and a very \"green \"feel. My number was #71. I ordered the kale Cesar and added chicken. I watched 9 other parties after me get their food and finally when #80 received their two salads. I asked is my salad coming out? One of the waiters said he would go check and miraculously he came back in about two minutes saying, \"they were just finishing tossing it. \" Really?  If it wasn't for the sweet bartender Haley, I would be giving 2 stars. The action of salad was good, but the chicken was dry. Disappointing considering the $14 salad."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and it's always great!  Just took my 3 kids and wife here for Mother's Day and they loved it.     Cocktails:  the cure and bloody Maria are awesome! Apps: go with the humus  Entrees:  great brunch, chicken and steak bowls, also highly recommend the steak sandwich.  The protein pancakes and protein berry smoothie are fantastic."}
{"text":"We loved this place so much that we came here twice and we were only in AZ for 3 days. Fantastic menu with a lot of healthy options. The egg white and kale scramble with country sausages were fantastic. The steak was good, the Brussell sprouts were good, and the cauliflower hash was delicious! They tasted like mashed potatoes without any of the guilt. I wish there was a farm & craft in LA, I would be a regular."}
{"text":"(If it wasn't for the kind manager I would give this place zero) we went in last night around 9:15pm. It wasn't busy at all. My friend gets me and her a drink from the bartender who was female. Our friends show up and sit up at the bar with us. After a solid 10 mins of not even a acknowledgement of my friends with even a napkin let alone water I ask a waitress to get the bartenders attention. I see she does and I wait. It's now been over 20 mins of her chatting with her friends and taking care of their drinks. It has now been over 30 mins of nothing. I finally asked for the manager who was kind and took care of us. He was wonderful. As for the bartender, she needs to find a new job!!!"}
{"text":"Took a friend from out of town here for lunch on a Friday afternoon and we were both pleasantly surprised with the delicious offerings at this restaurant.   She ordered a bowl and I ordered veggies and chicken. Both very healthy and tasty.  We also loved the outdoor seating options!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! It's so hard to find nice not super pricey healthy organic places. I love all the fresh ingredients and super yummie cocktails. I was very impressed with the KOMBUCHA CUCUMBER cocktail. Seriously delish!"}
{"text":"When I travel I know I'm going to eat like a total piggy so I try as much as possible to eat healthy during the daytime. We picked up breakfast from Farm & Craft and I got a hearty steak & quinoa bean bowl. It was so much food that it probably works have lasted me three meals if I had a fridge to store my leftovers."}
{"text":"We visited Farm & Craft on a Sunday afternoon and were immediately blown away by the gorgeousness of the restaurant. Every spot in this place is definitely Instagram worthy. Unfortunately, we weren't impressed with the food at all.   Their menu consists of some healthy choices, from acai bowls to steel cut oats. I opted for the Tocoa steak bowl. I was so underwhelmed by this dish. It definitely lacked seasoning. The steak was nice and tender, but again, it wasn't seasoned at all. This dish has so much potential - the  steak with the corn, tomato, sweet potato and jicama slaw with avocado were a perfect mix. My sister ordered the salmon poke bowl and our friend ordered the salmon toast with egg whites and we all found our dishes to be very bland. What we enjoyed the most was the sriracha we had at the table called \"Fix\" which Farm & Craft sells (I purchased one myself, it is the best sriracha I have ever had and can also be purchased at Amazon).   Our server was wonderful. Unfortunately, Farm & Craft reminds me of an inferior version of Flower Child. I may come back for happy hour drinks but that's about it."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, friendly service had a side salad & my husband had the strawberry salad we both had lemonade very refreshing on a very hot day!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this today. We were coming from the gym and anxious to eat some delicious food. Initially upon walking in, the staff seemed in a frenzy. The hostess was nowhere to be found. I approached the \"to-go\" attendant and she notified me the hostess would be back shortly quoting a 10 minute wait. So we sat at a lone chair and the hostess finally came around about 5 minutes later. She said she'd seat us shortly. We thought nothing of it as the place was packed. About 5 minutes later, the same hostess approached us and said sorry, she forgot about us and that it would be another 5 minutes. She just laughed it off and flippantly shrugged her shoulders. Really? We were the only ones waiting at this point. Okay, NOT the best first impressions so far.  We were finally seated. Decor and ambiance is great. Really appreciate the farm, modern feel they have going on. We had a nice waiter who was friendly and attentive. We ordered the chicken salad &pita, as well as the kale salad with steak. Bloody mary (habanero) was surprisingly bland. Chicken salad was good, but not very plentiful. The salad with steak was great.   I understand this is still in its infancy. We are hoping to come back to better initial impressions/front of house service, as well as more flavorful/plentiful servings of food. We will give it another shot as we live up the road! Still hungry.... :/"}
{"text":"Two previous times I've been here, it's been fantastic. This time however, their team definitely fell short. Upon first being greeted at our table, my guest and I both felt unnecessary attitude from our waitress, the restaurant ran out of the cocktail I wanted to order, and the appetizer I wanted to order. Not only were they not proficiently stocked on their basic ingredients, they also were out of an entree ingredient and the only other option available, they charged me for. They fixed the check only after saying it's been a common mistake today. It's the eveningtime Huns, if it's been a common mistake, I would hope you learn from them. I had to walk and find my waitress to get our checks. Overall, very unimpressed with this visit. Oh, and my martini tasted like cucumber. I asked if she could see how the bartender made it and I never received a response. I had a wonderful time with my lunch date, but this restaurant and waitress totally blew my experience. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a get together with friends from out of state. The location is great for the tourist crowd, setting is charming and the food was great. Everyone enjoyed their meal and drinks. I had the protein toast and would gladly order it again. To top it off, their servers were very friendly, patient and helpful. We need one in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Service and food were great. I sat at the bar and enjoyed a cocktail. My food arrived very quickly. Prices were reasonable for Old Town too. The only reason it's got 4 stars is, I chose them because I could earn DreamTrips points there (after finding them in our app). None of the employees were trained on it and they couldn't find the QR code. Given that I know the Montauk and the Chophouse within walking distance are up and running on this program, I'll think twice next time I'm deciding where to grab brunch! If you're not a member though, I'd still recommend this place."}
{"text":"What a terrific lunch! I heard about his place being a nice healthy alternative to the standard fare in Scottsdale. The atmosphere was bright and open and the service at lunch was easy...order at the desk and they bring it to your table. I was there with a friend and it was easy to have conversation without too much background noise. I asked the manager for her recommendations and she offered up two.  We both went for the Rustic Salmon Bowl...Great Choice! The veggies were cooked perfectly with a nice combination of Brussel sprouts, broccolini, carrots, and roasted cauliflower. Paired with the quinoa and the salmon it was delicious. I'm not a huge salmon fan but the fish was cooked perfectly and was a nice sized portion. I felt satisfied and not too full.   We hung out for an hour afterwards and had a nice time in a relaxed atmosphere. Nice job!  I'll be back for sure to try one of the savory burritos."}
{"text":"I had a business meeting here during lunch on Friday and had a great experience!  The restaurant is beautifully decorated, the staff was welcoming and super helpful and the food was healthy, fresh and quite tasty.  I opted for the build your own with salmon, brussel sprouts, and farro mac 'n cheese - wow, so delicious!  I also enjoyed a Patrick juice with pineapple, cantaloupe, grapefruit, jalapeno, cilantro and lime - refreshing and perfectly mixed as I was concerned the jalapeno would be too overpowering.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great healthy food, nice atmosphere with good service! Gluten free pizza tasted great. Healthy sized portions were just right and leave room for dessert. If you are looking to bust your gut full of calories hike to Buca down the road."}
{"text":"4/5 stars I think accurately represents the breakfast sandwich and burrito- Better then most but still have had better.   Ladies: make sure you throw up an Instagram pic next to the wall that says \"All I want is food and affection\". Otherwise, you lose your credibility as being a \" Scottsdale basic betch\"."}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place but definitely do not! First off, it was way too loud to hear each other due to the noise and poor acoustics. Second, the food was extremely bland. All six of us had different things and none were thrilled. (One sent hers back) Not sure if they are trying to be a bar or a restaurant. Flower Child and Chop Shop are  much better than this place for healthy food that's full of flavor. Cute inside and the server was nice but overall a big miss!"}
{"text":"This review is for breakfast. It most likely will be suppressed by Yelp via bribes from the business (see \"not recommended reviews\"). Made the mistake of coming here since because of the fake Yelp rating. Horribly long wait times, staff delivering food to wrong table. Flies flying all over the food. LOUD music at 9am can't hear myself thinking. Save yourself some frustration avoid, go to New Wave Market two steps away, similar menu, better service and less pretentious.  Food: underseasoned, bland. If you're on a salt restricted diet it might be worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food and consistently good service. Rustic Salmon Bowl highly recommended...the salmon is very well prepared...either they have a chef or are skillfully poaching the salmon and then searing it with perfect timing. Highly recommended! Think younger, cooler, more sophisticated cousin of Chop Shop, which makes me wonder if it's the same owner since they're next door to each other. Great cocktails too!"}
{"text":"Well, $12 bucks and a 30 minute wait for my take out lunch got me a small iced tea, three tiny pieces of plain, lukewarm, grilled chicken, and a few stalks of cold, limpid broccolini, drenched in some kind of oil, and terribly over-salted. When I selected the \"build your own,\" I didn't realize all I was getting was literally just the chicken and broccolini and nothing else. What a joke! Even Chop Shop delivers better value than this. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"While the atmosphere is nice, the salad I ate was not. The chicken was dry and the salad had no flavor. It was filled of ribs of the lettuce, when it was supposed to be a spinach salad. Might of had 5 pieces of spinach in it. I might as well have been eating a fast food salad. Yuck. I would not go back. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"It's as if things can't get better, but this was a much stronger time than I recall.  I brought my girlfriend and her sister-in-law here, you folks just killed it.  Our waitress navigated our meal perfectly providing insight into the drink and dinner menu.    Flat Iron Steak, and the Happy Apple Bourbon. Delicious."}
{"text":"The food is always great here. From their protein pancakes to their steak sandwich, you really can't go wrong.  Before 3pm you order at the front desk, which as of late has lengthy wait times. After 3pm they offer table service which 10x faster."}
{"text":"I come into farm and craft all the time, I think it's so cute and trendy, as well as having amazing (healthy) food, tasty cocktails. I always sit at the bar. I refrained from writing a review from my last visit because I find that people get carried away over one bad experience. I was in again last night and it was slow, so slow they decided to close early, (maybe around 8-9) which is totally fine and understandable. But my food took forever, which has been a reoccurring event. (Always about 30-45 mins for something that should take 15, after I have to remind them I had food put in.) I got my food and closed my check, and left it on the counter. The server with a very bold icy white haircut then proceeded to ask me if I was finished signing because he needed to \"run his checkout\", which I found rude and tactless, then continued to stack all the chairs around us. I get it, it's the holiday season, but you don't stack chairs in a restaurant until your last guest leaves, especially if you're closing two hours early. I felt rushed and my whole experience was handled so unprofessionally."}
{"text":"Food was great; the portions perfect.  Service was great too.  BUT, it was waaaayyyy too loud!  Music was loud requiring diners to yell over it.  Nearly impossible to have a conversation.  Honestly, couldn't wait to leave.  I hope they get it figured out  because the food and vibe were great!"}
{"text":"Love this place and totally recommend it! Great place for a healthy awesome meal. It will definitely be my new go to place."}
{"text":"Loved this place while attending Spring Training.  The food was awesome.  I like especially liked the protein pancakes.  Service was top notch and the environment was very nice.  The only reason for the 4 and not 5 rating is that the music was way to loud to point you couldn't talk and carry on a conversation.  You had to scream at the waitress to place your order.  But I will go back as the food is healthy, tasty, and the menu is very diverse."}
{"text":"The food here is great, but as they just opened their service is pretty slow and there were a few mistakes with the order ( the quinoa chicken salad came without quinoa at first) the servers were very nice tho and happy to help fix the problem, very nice atmosphere, a little pricey for portion sizes but definitely healthy!"}
{"text":"The concept was cool, the atmosphere is great, and the rest is blah. We left feeling very disappointed. The concept is like chop shop and flower child except they have alcohol. The restaurant is very loud and I could barely hear my husband at our two top.   It started with the service, which was painful. Our server took 15 minutes to appear for drink orders and never came back to get our food order. I had to go back to the hostess and ask her to find someone to take our order. I got the wellness cocktail and it tasted more like cold medicine. The food was not good. It was healthy, which is what I wanted, but it just tasted plain and unseasoned. We shared two items for appetizers. The mushroom flat bread was awful, the wheat crust tasted like bad pita bread that wasn't toasted. There were about 5 mushrooms on the entire pizza. And we added chicken sausage which tasted more like hot dog. The kale caesar salad was dry and hardly had any dressing. In the end I told our server what I thought and he merely smiled and handed me the bill. We had planned on ordering entrees but decided to forget it and went to Geisha for two sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Simply Gorgeous food, bright+ healthy and super friendly- smiles all around This is the perfect spot for healthy and super creative, feel-good cuisine  Seems more like a daytime place to me but they have reverse happy hour and I just discovered 7% cash back- how smart is that?  Be a little naughty and treat yourself to a koombucha cocktail and flax dough flatbread.  I seriously love this place and would eat here everyday  Please open one on Colorado like tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation, showed up and hostess said \"we got a rush and didn't get to keep your reservation, sorry\"...  Waited another 30min for a seat.  Food- order took 1.5 hrs to come out....really good(but not good enough for 1.5hr wait), tried the vegan pizza and root beer."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for after work drinks! Krista had a great attitude and the food was awesome. Will definitely back"}
{"text":"The food is amazing!! Can't wait to come back and try everything. I had the Rustic Farm (protein bowl) and it's very tasty and healthy! Yum! Love the atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"Very slow service and we were told we have to wait 45 minutes for a table even though there was an entire section that was empty inside! We sat at the bar for one hour and those tables were still empty! Food was average. Generally I'm not impressed!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, bland health food served in a cute, chic atmosphere.  My friend and I ordered the Cali Chicken Bowl and the Tocoa Steak Bowl for dinner. The protein portion that came with both bowls was just SO SMALL. Honestly...the bowls should really be renamed to something like \"quinoa/farro bowls with a side of meat\" because that would be less disappointing. And to add insult to injury, the steak was automatically cooked to medium (borderline well-done) resulting in a sad, chewy mess.   We also ordered the \"Sweet Potato Hash\" to share which essentially was chopped boiled sweet potato. To salvage both of our bowls, my friend and I found ourselves dousing everything in Cholula - so, like, at this point, is it even healthy anymore?   As a Bay Area transplant, I have to compare Farm & Craft to Tender Greens in California (a chain that specializes in healthy, farm-to-fork cuisine) and say that F&C absolutely pales in comparison when it comes to flavor, portion size, and price point.   Kudos for being cute and having Instagrammable decor, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Wanted to thank our wonderful waiter Matthew. He went above and beyond. He really took care of us ( the customer). The food was delish!! We ll be back"}
{"text":"Met the girl crew out last Friday for dinner and drinks. The food/menu theme has a spiffy lifestyle choice for things like anti-inflammatory, stress relief, detox and another I totally forget. We loved the drinks-kudos to the bartender, the drink menu is artisan style! Wine selection pretty concise. App portions good for 4 hungry felines  and most of the options were rather healthy which we are ALL about! We started with the hummus app and a grilled veggie bowl with these great dips. I had one of their Farro based bowls. It has a good flavor but the Farro was served al dente. Thanks to the staff and manager for such a great night!"}
{"text":"The service is very good here. If you get a chance it at the bar. Try the kale and cucumber vodka drink - it's a winner! Especially in the morning"}
{"text":"Cute place, instagram worthy. I came here for breakfast and was impressed with the restaurant's deco. I wish i could justify myself to go back but i can't. The food was overpriced and wasn't the greatest. I had Avocado toast which was decent, but $9 for one piece of toast??? I think i will go somewhere else. It is too bad because i really liked the restaurant's deco and concept."}
{"text":"Wow! What an AWESOME establishment! Every time I come here it is consistently excellent. The first time I came in, I had the protein toast. It was the perfect ratio of avocado to egg, and I had a side of bacon to go with because why not. The next time I came in I had the $20 wine and pizza deal with the kale pesto flatbread. It was delicious! I loved it so much that I got a second flatbread, the Farmhouse, to go. The service was extremely attentive, and the GM even came over throughout my stay to make sure I was satisfied. What a stellar experience, I wish I had one of these back home! I can't wait for them to expand and surely will return when I visit Scottsdale again!"}
{"text":"Good clean food. My wife really liked it, I didn't so much. I'll go again because my wife wants to go."}
{"text":"Loud and over priced. $11 for a turkey wrap, $4 for a small iced tea. Farro Mac n cheese was good."}
{"text":"I really liked it here! I am surprised the reviews aren't better.    Food: I thought the food was great.  I loved how their diet also pointed out different things you can eat based upon certain diets.  I am on a doctor imposed anti-inflammatory diet & it showed me what on the menu fit into that diet.  The drinks looked & sounded delicious but I can't currently drink :(  I did have the chocolate protein shake that fit pretty close to being in this crazy diet and actually tasted good.  I also go the Roast Brussel Sprouts, Broccolini with steak which was yummy!  I also got the strawberry & goat salad which was good.     Atmosphere: I thought it was quaint and felt very fresh.  It gave you that back to basic earthy feel.    Service:  Our waitress happened to be great.    Prices:  Go elsewhere if you want cheap GMO veggies from another country, meat product and other questionable chemical products.  Healthy truly \"natural\" food is rarely cheap these days.  Farm & Craft is in par price-wise with other restaurants similar.  Me cooking the same meal at home could possibly cost about the same here, so I didn't think the prices were bad at all."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and was excited to go with the Gf and another couple for a couples night out. Met up with the couple at the bar and had a kale and lime juice cocktail. Not bad but it took awhile to actually make the drink as the bartenders are not Craft cocktail experts and don't seem too worried about speed. Once I got it, the cocktail was great.   Was sat about fifteen minutes later and it took 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us for water and more cocktails.   Had the spinach and artichoke dip to start and the roasted chicken for my main course.   I feel like this is where the tale of two dinners starts. Tale 1: the food was good and flavorful for being a healthy option. Tale 2: When you have a ton of early 20 hipsters waiting on you, you get slow crappy service and they seem to not care. I would have made a concession if they were super busy but they weren't.   I really like F&C and hope the service improves. We dropped 100 on drinks and dinner with tip. Scottsdale has too many good places in that price range so service needs to be top notch."}
{"text":"Nice to have some healthy fare in Old Town, but service is a bit odd (we had a great server but a girl coming around to pour water seemed drunk) and my chicken bowl was extremely bland. The cocktails and decor are good, though!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing this restaurant just decided to stop serving food because they \"had a very busy morning\" sounds like poor management & poor planning on New Years Eve when one should know options are limited. Also parking here is brutal so I'd go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Food is great, service is wonderful & Jackson, server, is remarkable! He's very attentive & answered all questions on the drink & food menus!! Great experience!!"}
{"text":"Favorite place in Scottsdale so far. Here for the weekend and decided to try any place we walked by. Great drinks and great service. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was very fresh. The place is super open and neat. I got a lavender lemonade that was really good. I also got a juice to go that I LOVED. my dog enjoyed the patio and they have a cute toy basket and brought him water. I will say the patio is small for dogs though. The crowd is definitely on the \"uppity\" side but what do you expect."}
{"text":"I'm super pumped that Farm & Craft opened up in our hood! We came for brunch. Everything was super tasty and reasonable prices. I got the American breakfast: two eggs over medium (they were over cooked) with the chicken sausage. All tasted great except for the overcooked eggs but whatever - what really was not cool was how terrible the knife was, you need a steak knife with that chicken link!   Hubs got the burrito, loved it. Don't be thrown off by flax seed tortillas and bread because it was all good.  Service was alright - BUT our server was pretty pushy even when we made it clear that we were waiting for a 3rd person. Kinda annoying.   Anyway, the place is GORGEOUS, you'll love the menu options and don't shy away from the \"healthy\" aspect because the food was all delish.   I'd love to come back again soon and hopefully get this review up to 5 stars - I really want them to do well here!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Atmosphere is lovely. But the service is pretty rough. Came to lunch with coworkers, and we were here over an hour and there were people who still hadn't gotten their food. They eventually refunded money and gave them their food to go but it was a little ridiculous. I don't recommend coming here unless you have the time to sit around for over an hour waiting for your food."}
{"text":"Tasty, healthy, quick, and friendly. 4 categories, 5 stars.   Great work Farm and Craft. Keep on Farming and Crafting."}
{"text":"Farm and craft offers delicious and healthy food, which is a refreshing change to the usual old town scottsdale food choices. I went with a few friends and our order included the gluten free chicken salad wrap, and two of the create your own bowls. One had the salmon, Brussels sprouts, and broccolini while the other had the beef, sweet potato hash, and farro mac and cheese. All of our food was delicious as was evident by your clean plates. My favorite was the broccolini which had a hint of heat with chili flakes. All of the food was fresh, and cooked perfectly. We also had a bottle of the house rose which was crisp and refreshing. The staff was also delightful and attentive. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants delicious and flavorful healthy food."}
{"text":"Awesome food, pressed juices and friendly service. Great place for lunch or dinner!  The kombucha cucumber cocktail is a must try!"}
{"text":"I came here for the kombucha and rum! Lol saw the reviews and the menu and I love kombucha and I enjoy rum, so when I saw that they mix both here I knew I needed to try this.  The food tasted so fresh but then again I'm starting to think the Arizona Restaurants buy nothing but fresh produce! Good job!  I had sweet potato with eggs and applewood chicken sausage. I loved the applewood chicken sausage! I sat at the bar and the bartender was nice and attentive but just wished they were more friendly. No complaints, they did a good job. I'm just use to bartenders sparking conversations with me. However the area is beautiful, the food was great, the service was quick so overall I will be back! Soon..."}
{"text":"Very cute inside. A lot if great and creative drinks, from lavender lemonade to gin and kombucha. Chicken salad wrap on homemade pita was good, just needed more sauce, as it was a bit dry. Perhaps an option of chips, fruit, coleslaw, potato salad rather than just mixed greens on side would be nice. Thai noodle pasta salad was good, kind of too spicy for my taste, and unfortunately extremely tiny portion for $10."}
{"text":"So we decided not to believe the yelp reviews. That was the first mistake we made. We showed up on Sunday at 9 AM the restaurant was half empty. Next we ordered our food after waiting 15 minutes for a waitress to take our order. Next we waited 35 minutes before food showed up. It was cold. Next we actually tasted our food and it was the bland with no flavor and grossly overpriced for what it was. We ordered coffee and sugar. We waited 10 minutes to get our sugar. At that point the coffee was cold as well. We wait another 10 minutes for a waitress to come back but she didn't so we had to go to the front And ask for a check. It's funny as we were leaving that the person next to us asked a different waitress to make the food again because it was cold.....We will never go back.... please be smart and trust the yelp reviews. I don't like to review places that don't deserve it but it's worth mentioning that the place and location are trendy and nice."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Loved he organic options and drinks on tap. Patio seating is a must. Make sure to try their salads and gluten free wraps. Gluten free that has a great taste. Went here for a birthday lunch and girls night."}
{"text":"What a cute place right? Grwat location, great design, intriguing menu. Fails to deliver. The atmosphere and design is much better than the food and service.  I had the salmon today. So dry... would not recommend. I go to the chop shop next door often and i love it. This one needs a little help. Hopefully they'll get it together shortly. It has potential!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here for the first time, as we had heard good things about this restaurant from friends. Food was good, but service was poor. Specifically: Long wait for food after ordering, once food arrived, the toast was missing. Toast did not arrive until I after finished eating. Side order of sausage was also forgotten, it too did not arrive until both of us were finished. Also food server never came by for coffee refills. As stated though the food was good and we will give it another try as it may have just been an off day.  2/11/18 -- My wife and I decided to give Farm and Craft another try, in part because of the nice response from Kevin. It is unfair to fully evaluate a restaurant based on one experience. And I will say that on this visit the negative issues did not reoccur. The food was, as before, very good and the simultaneous arrival of all items ordered was appreciated. The menu, very much health oriented, will find a large appreciative audience here in Scottsdale. It was a bit cool for the large patio, but the openness of the large doors gives the restaurant a very airy feeling. I would encourage others to give the restaurant a try.  DDL"}
{"text":"Holy conundrum, in the middle of the most superficial part of scottadale lives a little haven, fresh food, great menu, fun yet loud atmosphere, great for breakfast, lunch or diner.. gluten free options, farm to table ish.. please be the one that sets the pace and pushes a trend to get rid of the \"old scottsdale\" you rock, I will return often."}
{"text":"We were touring the area & in the mood for brunch & the hotel recommended Farm & Craft. The restaurant is a nice size & has a brightly lit space, inclusive of outdoor seating. I ordered the 'Breaky Burrito' & house-made kombucha. The burrito was served cut on the diagonal & plated in a semi stack, with the corn relish served on the side in a 2oz steel ramekin. The serving size of the burrito was generous & ample enough that I was able to share a few bites with my dining partner. The house-made flax wrap was delicious, had a nice texture & was slightly charred, enhancing the flavor. The ingredients were fresh & well balanced, although the \"nitrate-free bacon\" was a tad overdone & chewy. Overall, it was one of the freshest & tastiest breakfast burritos I've eaten. The kombucha was good & while I didn't have one, they've created a bevy of kombucha cocktails.   The focus of F&C is on healthy & sustainable food, with a menu they boast as a \"seasonal \"Wellness-Menu\".  I enjoyed the atmosphere, the varied food choices & my meal. If I'm ever in Scottsdale again, I hope the choices & foodstuffs will be as refreshing & tasty as they were this visit."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious!  The vegan  pad Thai is phenomenal and so fresh!  We tried the avocado  hummus as well and it was really tasty.  Everything was so good we ended to getting food to go for the rest of the family.  The only reason it's a 4 instead of 5 is that the wait for the food was really long and service wasn't great, but I think they must have been understaffed or some were not being productive.  Overall really good."}
{"text":"The Protein Pancakes were absolutely delicious! Meant to take a picture but I ate them too quickly!  Laid back atmosphere and nothing but healthy locally sourced food options!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Short Story-Health Focused Restaurant- Organic, Hormone Free, Local Farms, Grass Fed-                     Good Food - Small Portions - Great for dieters and Ladies that Lunch!                      Youthful Help - but inexperience shows at this time- Could use more training                     Modern Fresh Bright Atmosphere but energetic and very LOUD w/Techno Music                      Whole menu isn't offered till 3 on the weekends                       Newly opened and changes could be in progress  Long Story-  We entered and were told it would be a fifteen- twenty minute wait and we were the only people waiting. The hostess asked my husband for his phone number to call him for when our table will be ready. He says I'm right here, you don't need to call me. While we are waiting we look at the menu that is posted on the wall and see many things we are interested in only to find out latter that these items aren't actually offered until 3 o'clock.   We get seated in about 5 minutes and when the hostess pulls the chair out for me I see that it is wet with three good sized spills of water. I look at the hostess and she just smiles and doesn't say or do anything.....so I unravel the silverware and dry up the chair myself. Afterwards she said she'd bring me a new napkin.  I wasn't expecting a BRUNCH Menu because the whole menu is posted on their website as of yesterday 7-16-16. We asked about the items we were interested in and our server wasn't aware that these items weren't on the menu. The server said they offer everything at 3 o'clock.  I soon receive my Strawberry and Goat Cheese Salad with added Chicken ($13.00). The spinach didn't look like packed spinach and looked farm grown because it was the bigger leaves. The strawberries were the really delicious kind and don't taste like cardboard like the kind you buy from the store. The Goat Cheese was very good quality that was mild and very creamy. The chicken was flavorful but a little dry on the end pieces. I'm guessing the amount of chicken breast was about 2 ounces. I thought it was a good salad.  My husband had the steak sandwich. He asked for horseradish instead of horseradish sauce. His sandwich came slathered with very hot horseradish. It was too hot in some places and he should have asked them to put the horseradish on the side because he didn't think someone would put the very hot horseradish on so heavy. The bread that made up the sandwich was very good. The beef in the sandwich was good but it also seemed like two ounces. An eye catching fancy vegetable salad came with the sandwich that tasted very mildly flavored.  Don't know if they do this all the time but they offered us complimentary hot fresh vegan cookies. Tasty but slightly greasy.  I would come back for the food but would prefer a patio seat when the weather is right because the music was too loud for me.   My husband would not because his platter didn't satisfy him and he complained to me that he was still hungry.  3.5 stars - in the end the food was good and this restaurant is newly opened so I rounded the stars up."}
{"text":"My fiancÃ© and I went here last night for dinner. Everything we ate here was great! We got the nachos for appetizer per out waitress' suggestion and they were phenomenal. I got the chicken tacos and my fiancÃ© got the cheeseburger...We both ate every bite! I also got a tequila cocktail (very good). Our food took about 20 minutes and our waitress' was one of the best we have had. Love the atmosphere and loved sitting outside on the patio. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance at this place! Went for some juices and ended up trying the chicken salad. I was a but disappointed that it wasn't a greens salad but it was still pretty good. Definitely returning for a nice glass of wine next time"}
{"text":"My expectations were pretty high for this restaurant.  Had such a cool ambiance!  We tried them for a late lunch and left so disappointed. I ordered the humus plate as an appetizer, which was fine.  My problem was my main entree. I put together my own dish.  I had the steak with the brussel sprouts.  Neither had any real flavor.  I asked for my steak to be medium rare and it came out well.  No pink at all.  I sent it back and it came back the same way. Ugh!  All in all, it came out to over $120 for the four of us.  My daughter only had a side of the mac and cheese farro, which was actually really good.   I don't see myself going back."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good place to eat with the kids after being at the water park and mini golfing and stumbled on this wonderful and amazing restaurant.  Even our picky son loved the quinoa Greek salad with chicken!..... the vegan ceviche and  avocado hummus were amazing!! We will definitely be back before we leave to go back home to Indiana!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! And that's basically the reason why we decided to come here for an early dinner... that and the fact that they looked pretty vegan friendly.  They totally were! I ended up getting this steak bowl but my server was super nice and helpful and let me swap the steak for tofu. It was so good!!  We also got to take some cute pictures with the walls (they're so fun!) I'd love to come back and try their brunch.  The only reason why I'm giving a 4 instead of a 5 is because it is a little pricy. My friend paid $14 for two small tacos, and I paid around 12 for my bowl which could've been a little more full. However, I could tell that the ingredients were fresh and everything was delicious so yeah!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place...best food, great service, everything so fresh & healthy. I drive 20 miles to get here & will continue to do that!!!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with their mushroom pizza and kombucha on tap!  and on happy hour the pizza is so cheap Mon-Fri until 6pm it's only $5. I always ask for extra greens because that is what makes it for me. The first time I visited I did try a few other things but didn't really dig it but I just had to give it a 5 star because I will continue to come back for my favorites!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal healthy food! Love it here, great vibe, great drinks and of course, great food!  Perfect for what DT Scottsdale needs!!!"}
{"text":"Must try for new places in Scottsdale. Flavorful, delicious food that isn't over salted, everything is made here Fresh and with a purpose. Try the Kombucha cocktails for something different. They also have a great happy hour Monday through Friday from 2-6 pm and then a reverse happy hour starting at 9 pm."}
{"text":"Short version:  It's very good.  I will continue to come back here.    Longer version:  A very good choice for a healthy meal.  I love it.  The food combos are balanced, creative, and savory.  The chef has done well.   The ingredients are super fresh.  This isn't a \"grab a green juice and go\" kind of place - at least not in the evening.   The decor is very comfortable.   They did a nice job here, all around.   It's basically a little nicer version of another well-known place situated close-by that offers a similar product . . .  But I wouldn't get a juice here.  I don't think the juices are prepared per order.  I think they do a bunch all at once in the morning, and again in the afternoon and sell the batch."}
{"text":"A lot of reviews compared this to Flower Child or Chop Shop. It's not an order at the counter type of place though, you are seated an have a waiter.  Food was alright, pretty pricey for what you got. We came here for breakfast. Nothing stood out to be that great. I probably won't come back for breakfast but maybe I'll have to try their lunch out.  I ordered the avocado toast and chia pudding. Both very small."}
{"text":"I ordered a make your own bowl I got the chicken and Mac and cheese the Mac and cheese was great no complaints the chicken was seasoned great but very chewy very similar to Applebee's chicken but chewier the portion was on the smaller side they should invest in some Perdue chicken"}
{"text":"Strange experience. Some other customers were given a full menu when seated, though we were given a smaller \"brunch menu\" with only 2 sandwiches and a couple salads on it, everything else was breakfast food - even though it was 4pm. We asked for the other menu and was told that's not the menu for today... even though they have that menu on the board when you walk in - which you can order from for take out... I'm not sure why we couldn't order that food when eating at the Farm & Craft.  The staff was rushed and disorganized. We ordered more pita for our hummus and it arrived after our mains, even though the hummus was an appetizer... The food was tasty but not out of this world. Overall, not a great experience. I'd rather go to ChopShop next door for similar food, better service and a more enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the Salmon Poke Bowl.   Slips in there for $15 buckers.    Rainbow quinoa, fresh ginger cucumber salad accompanied with edamame.   Topped with jicama salad and a avocado.     Holler!  The mimosa and big wave golden ale are recommended."}
{"text":"Just didn't love it. It wasn't easy to order there. (They got my order wrong.). No delicious gluten free treats. The use boxed almond milk....really, it was just okay. I will try it again, because it is a cute place. Just not sold yet. Flower Child might be the better choice."}
{"text":"I had heard this restaurant had healthy, fresh food. It does, but it lacks  so much. The noise level is extremely loud. It was a shouter meal to say the least. Space was limited, but there were several open chairs at the group table. I asked a woman if she wouldn't mind moving over a chair, so I could sit with my friend. She moved, under protest. The servers (hard to get their attention) should be doing that job. We had to ask for silverware. I was so underwhelmed with the build-your-own dish--chicken with quinoa salad.  There were 4 tender small pieces of chicken and about a half cup of salad with a teaspoon of quinoa. Not what I envisioned. High prices, small portions and essentially no customer service. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Healthy and yummy. The juices are delicious and so is the hummus. Had the steak bowl entree and enjoyed the flavors."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great vibe and atmosphere. I loved the tree in the center of the restaurant and the open air corner bar.   I enjoyed the Kombucha and Bourbon cocktail tremendously. I guess it's one of the few restaurants in the country that offers kombucha cocktails, they said.  My friends ordered the Farmhouse Flatbread with chicken sausage, fennel, asparagus, tinker bell pepper and mozzarella. Pretty good flatbread, I must say.  From photos right here on Yelp, I decided to order the farro Mac and cheese with the salmon as an added protein. The sustainable salmon came out first with the flatbreads. Then awkwardly after we were almost done eating, my farro Mac and cheese finally came out.  I didn't understand because one of the girls ordered the exact same thing as I did but with Brussel sprouts too in addition to the salmon and the farro. It was plated all together on a single plate instead of separate plates like mine and it came out with the flatbreads. I was super hungry trying to wait for mine to come out so I could eat it together with the salmon. You might say I was \"hangry.\"   Ultimately, strangeness aside, the farro Mac and cheese was the true standout that evening! Don't hesitate to order the farro. The salmon does go really well with it too. I couldn't help but taste my friend's Brussel sprouts and wish I ordered them too! Next time, I will!"}
{"text":"Beautiful, trendy, but sadly the food didn't live up to the atmosphere. A friend and I were excited to try this place. We both love healthy food and the menu looked amazing. I think as the restaurant matures, the food will match the vibe.  We ordered the kale Caesar with chicken. It was truly one of the worst kale salads I have ever had. We both pushed it around our plate. Woody, dry, like eating sticks. Definitely skip.  We also ordered the Brussels sprouts-very good and the hummus-ok. The whole wheat pita was chalky and dry. Some good veggies to go with it would have made it more appealing.  The oddest part of the whole dining experience was they gave us plastic utensils. Even when I am busy and eat at my desk, I pull out real silverware. Definitely tacky.   For now we'll stick to the places around there that have their food worked out-chop shop and herb box."}
{"text":"The most simple way to put it is 'NOT GOOD'. Yes, I understand it is a healthy menu but there are way better places to go spend your money ie: TrueFood.  What's the worst is that I was so excited for this place to open and to say I was let down is an understatement. Hummus was bland. Wild mushroom flatbread was incredibly bland and almost inedible. I did not care for the wheat dough what so ever. There is an obvious lack of toppings and the bread overwhelms each bite. I don't even think they were true wild mushrooms on the pizza as it was advertised, more like generic button mushrooms I could easily get from sprouts. Not worth the money plain and simple. Will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Farm & Craft is one of my favorite spots in town. Great Kombucha cocktails & food. Got the chicken pesto & kale Caesar this time which were both delicious! Service was amazing as always!!"}
{"text":"Meh. Good atmosphere, service is not bad, but not amazing either. My friend sat in the corner of our table and had servers bending over in her face to get water glasses every 2 mins. It was like hummus with a side of butts. Food wasn't bad but overpriced and not Something you couldn't whip up at home. Portions are small. If you've been once you've seen it all. It's rather bro-tastic and I can see it doing well in that area of town...or not."}
{"text":"Great place! Great brunch and coffee as well if you're looking for something quick and tasty. Service is prompt and friendly. I would come here before I went to the chop shop next door."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the valley also for fresh, healthy food and an cool atmosphere. I love everything on the menu. You really can't go wrong. Come for happy hour and sit at the bar!"}
{"text":"It has been a while since i dined in old town. During Sunday brunch hours, we were there debating where to eat and saw decent amount of people there so decided to take a chance.  Sat outside on a sunny day with mimosa and a pale ale with nice friendly staff. Had tuna pokey and hamburger.  Pokey was good but the winner was the burger. It was one of the best burgers we had. Highly recommend trying the burger!!! It was such a pleasant surprise and made our relaxing day a memorable time!"}
{"text":"I'm going to leave a 5 star review because I love the food here. Especially the Strawberry & Goat Salad. Atmosphere is cool. The idea of farm to table is magnificent and I appreciate them being in business due to our dietary restrictions.   Truthfully today I wanted to leave a 2 or 3 star review, because for the second time they just decided to close early, because the restaurant was slow. It's a Friday night and you closed your restaurant at 9pm?!?!?! What?!?!? Adjust your hours if you have to, but it's very frustrating to drive to the restaurant (for the second time) to have it be closed 2 hours ahead of the posted time."}
{"text":"I guess we just expecting something a bit different. There were only 2 appetizing non meat options, so that's what we ordered.  I had the protein pancakes. A little on the dry side but such small portions even for a scrawny guy like me. I stopped by Chipotle to get a veggie burrito afterwards. My buddy ordered an egg dish. It was much more flavorful than my dish, but again, small portion.   The atmosphere is very farmhouse chic, replete with beautiful people serving and dining. My bloody Mary was quite good."}
{"text":"We only went here for a drink and the staff was amazing and the atmosphere was nice and relaxing."}
{"text":"Came here on a pretty busy Saturday afternoon. We were seated after only waiting 5 minutes but our service was very slow after that. I ordered the cold brew which was a mistake. I don't know if this is how their cold brew normally tastes but it was so watered down and had no flavor. I literally had to tell the waitress that I didn't like it and got a water instead. My wife's kombucha that she ordered was actually really good though. They were only having brunch when we were there so I got the egg white scramble with sweet potato and chicken sausage. The dish was good overall but it definitely needed some more salt and I thought that it would have been nice if they added some veggies to it. My wife got the turkey wrap and she enjoyed that. It was just an okay experience and a little overpriced. I would come back for a happy hour or try something different in the future."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Exceptional service. Try the cocktails. I didn't get a chance to try the kombucha cocktails but will be sure to do so next time. The hydrator cocktail was so yummy, not too sweet you could have two or three. Alexis, my waitress was so great!"}
{"text":"Have only had breakfast, but there are a lot of healthy, tasty offerings.  Fun atmosphere and area (there's a lot going on in this neighborhood).  Doesn't yet have the crowds that some of the nearby competitors do, but the word will get out and the food quality/value is superior."}
{"text":"Amazing!!  My husband and I decided to try this place out after we stumbled upon it from a walk we took while eaiting for a table at the Breakfast Club. I'm glad we did.   It's healthy, delicious and in good portions. This is my new favorite breakfast joint. I definitely will be a regular."}
{"text":"Had brunch here to nurse a hangover. The steak bowl did not disappoint."}
{"text":"This place seemed like a nice trendy place and food looked great on yelp. We showed up waited 15 minutes before someone came to take our order. Once we ordered our food we waited about 30 minutes before we got the food  and food was COLD, no flavor. Service was slow, coffee was also cold I asked for sugar and finally I had to get up and get it myself. The waitress never came back after she gave us the food. Once we were done I also had to go find her to pay for our bill. I understand sometime places are busy but they were not busy will no come back again."}
{"text":"Great menu, great portions, decent prices, wonderful atmosphere, and really good staff.  So refreshing to have since I live in Old Town and always trying to shop and eat local, but find I crave heading to a place that cares all around about the dining experience of their guests."}
{"text":"Updating my review again for 3rd time. They're making improvements. Not as loud but service is still slow. Online ordering is still off. And no chia pudding. Loud music definitely came down a tad."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a weekday afternoon. Great location.  Had some speciality drinks at bar - which were great! Service was less than desirable. Very slow and inattentive.  Almost left because of it."}
{"text":"Stopped here for drinks when we first got into town. The drinks are made from fresh ingredients & have healthy options like Kombucha shots. I will try one of those on the next trip but the cocktail with coconut water, blueberries, and vodka was amazingly refreshing. We sat at the bar which is inside and outside. It was a great way to start our spring training day out!"}
{"text":"Good but not great. They have the right concept but much of the execution was underwhelming.  The kale juice combination I had was watery and poured over ice. Expensive and mediocre.  American Breakfast plate was half good half not good. Eggs were nice although not cooked over medium as I asked for. Cubed potatoes were awful. Bacon was ok.  Pretty loud place with much hipsterizing. Good and friendly service."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night with a friend last month.  The restaurant was about a third full. The restaurant dÃ©cor fit the name of the restaurant perfectly.  We were greeted and seated very quickly.  The service was great until we paid the bill.  My friend just came back from hiking and was drinking lots of water.  The water glass went empty for about 10-15 minutes before it got refilled.  The biggest problem was the food.  Started off with the hummus.  I've never had hummus that ran thru the tines of the fork.  It was the consistency of a soup.  The flavor was even worst.  It had no flavor.  It tasted like mashed chickpeas mixed with water.  There was no tahini  flavor at all.  The pita bread that came with it tasted old.  They could have heated it up to freshen it up.  I had the Strawberry and Goat Cheese Salad.  It was a little small as other people stated, but I had a big lunch so it was the perfect size for me.  The problem was there was only two strawberries the size of grapes.  To make up for it I think they gave me LOTS of goat cheese.  I like goat cheese but it's really strong and you need to balance it with the rest of the ingredients.  My friend had the chicken and sweet potato hash  She liked the hash a lot, but the chicken was only okay. She recommended this restaurant and was kind of sorry we came here.  I only gave it two stars because it's all about the food.  The service and atmosphere are fine.  Maybe it was off night.  Even our company cafeteria makes better food considering the number of complaints they receive."}
{"text":"Good: kombucha cocktails.. happy hour prices $8, worth it. Otherwise $12 for 6oz  Needs improvement on time of order to eating, took over 45 mins and came as a carry out even though we ordered to eat here.    We ordered artichoke dip, ... skip it. It was luke warm and clotting cheese.  Chicken tacos were good but pretty spicy.   Would I go back- no."}
{"text":"We walked in on a Friday night, no greeting. We stood there awkwardly then decided to look for room at the bar (no seats), we thought the high top was open seating and sat down. We were informed that it wasn't, and given menus. Our server was quite fond of asking questions then walking away before we could reply. Same for the guy who dropped our food. I had to poach utensils from a nearby table because he split.  Cocktails and flatbread were solid.   It was painful to leave a 20% tip for being treated like a nuisance, but I have basic respect and the struggle is real. Perhaps this team had an off night and decided to take it out on our table? The food was good, so I will probably order from postmates, at least my driver tells me thank you and to have a nice night."}
{"text":"Love the ambience here. Healthy kamboucha drinks!!!!Flexible menu if you have any gluten and dairy restrictions ++++ Food is delicious. Highly recommend their flat bread and chocolate chia pudding. Friendly servers. Everything in this place is almost perfect."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Old Macdonald Had A Farm)  Oldtown Scottsdale had a Farm C-R-A-F-T And on this Farm they had some food C-R-A-F-T  So I Yelp, Yelp here, And I Yelp, Yelp there,  Here a Yelp, there a Yelp, Everywhere a Yelp, Yelp,  Oldtown Scottsdale had a Farm C-R-A-F-T   Gotta love this place!  I came with a good friend of mines and the place was quite busy for a Thursday night.  We first sat at the bar to order our drinks before sitting down.  For starters we ordered the Hummus and Pitas.  A good start overall; you can really taste the flax seed pita and the sweet homemade hummus with watermelon radish was a delight; texture of crispiness meets smooth creamy bite!  For our entrees my partner ordered the Tocoa Steak Bowl while I shot for the Cali Chicken.  I didn't get to try the Tocoa Steak Bowl, but the Cali Chicken Bowl came on a bed of Quinoa, a kale salad mixed with asparagus, edamame, heirloom tomatoes, endive, jack cheese, and quarter of a avocado.  Overall, it was heavily laden with ingredients, but it didn't make you feel full.  I love the texture of the crisp asparagus mixed with the edamame in the kale salad which was lightly blanched; thus retaining it's texture also.  The cheese and tomatoes gave it a sweet bite, while the avocado was there, but who doesn't love avocados!?    In the end, Farm & Craft is a hip contemporary clean eating restaurant.  I really enjoyed our service and plan to make it back for another round to order the pressed concoctions of healthy drinks! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Verdict: The cooks are getting crafty in this kitchen and I like it.  No sign of the farm but you'll find some craft behind the food here. This was a nice, light, and healthy feeling break after a long weekend of the opposite.  I got the breakfast burrito and sweet potato hash. There burrito didn't match what you'll often find in New Mexico and I didn't expect it to. It felt a bit like a breakfast wrap with the type of bread. The farm-to-table type ingredients inside also made the burrito much less heavy, which I appreciated.   The sweet potato hash was a big winner. It wasn't cheap as a side dish but it was the right size and the flavor made it more than worthwhile. I'd get that again in a heartbeat.  Farm & Craft has some hot sauces available at one of the nearby counters while you're eating. They're quite good so grab one and give it a try."}
{"text":"Discovered this place on a whim last week and I've been here 3 times now for breakfast and dinner! Highly recommend the build your own steak and farro Mac n cheese as a dinner entree. It's cheap for a delicious meal! Sometimes the portions can be a little small, but I understand this place endorses health eating so it's never an issue!"}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed in the lack of service I experience this morning. I have heard so many great things about this place and was looking forward to trying it for awhile now.  We arrived at 9:45am and got seated on the patio right away. There was a few other tables on the patio as well which is why I don't understand how we were completely ignored by the wait staff walking by. After 15 minutes, we watched 2 other tables get sat and greeted by their server right away. The hostess and 2 other servers even looked right at us sitting there with our menus but didn't seem to care to ask us if we had been helped yet.   We decided to leave since we didn't have time to continue waiting. When we approached the gentleman at the front who seated us (possibly a manager?), we expressed our disappointment and told him we were never greeted even after the 2 tables who sat down after us were assisted right away. He apologized but that was about it.   I'd like to give this place a second chance, but I feel like the lack of concern and customer service has already proven that it may not be worth it."}
{"text":"This place is precious. I'm glad I came in, I was planning on going to Chop Shop but walked past Farm & Craft on my way in. The decor is clean and simple. I ordered the Cali Bowl {quinoa | kale | cherry heirloom tomato | edamame | asparagus | yellow endive | pepper jack cheese | avocado}. Presentation was on point and it was almost too pretty to eat! The tomato added a great acidic boost to the dish. I liked it so much I recreated it at home (results may vary). I also got one of their fresh pressed juices- which honestly next time I'll skip. It was pretty expensive at $7. And I just can't justify spending $7 on a drink that doesn't have any alcohol lol! Which brings me to my next point, their bar set up is really cute and I wish I would've sat there so I could see what type of selection they offered. I will make it a point to come back here for some Bloody Mary's and brunch!"}
{"text":"I really like that they promote a wellness and anti-inflammatory diet. Stopped in for a drink with my friend. We walked in and were not sure whether to order at the counter or sit down. There was young woman training someone and they both told us we could order at the counter. The watermelon drinks brought us in so we ordered one each. We took a number and sat at a table. The bartender brought out our drinks and when we tried them, we were trying to figure out if they had alcohol or not. I asked a server if there was alcohol and he went to the bartender to ask. He came back and said yes. My friend then decided to go and ask how much an extra shot was to another bartender and she said $9. These drinks tasted like watermelon juice with water. At $15 a drink, I would expect a bit more. I then asked the other bartender (that made them) and she stated,\"oh yea I definitely put vodka in those.\" She walked away and left her shift. We saw people come in and sat right down, with a server immediately offering them waters and menus. I don't really understand if this is a Panera type atmosphere or restaurant style but not once were we offered water (until the host came 45 min later to just check on us) or if we wanted food.  Unfortunately, when I checked my statements a few days later, there was an added tip on top of the tip I had left at the beginning. It's really not about the money because it was very minimal and could have been an honest mistake by the new host. But after all that? All I am saying is when you go, be sure to check your bank statements if you pay card."}
{"text":"All the vibes and all the healthy eats at Farm and Craft!   I was overwhelmed with the decor outside and inside this spot!   You can get fresh craft cocktails with fresh squeezed juices and kombucha! They've got wine and beer on draft too.   I ended up going with the Cali Chicken Bowl and woah, it was delish! The side of kale with edamame and cheese was to die for and addictive.   Hubs had the turkey wrap and he was making all the yummy sounds while devouring it.   You'll want to eat here everyday. Literally. Everything is so fresh and colorful and the ambiance will gave you feeling all the calmness and beauty of the space.   They're dog friendly on their patio too and probably a frequent dining spot for all pet owners and lovers!  Can't wait to go back lol!"}
{"text":"I was there on a Sunday afternoon with a friend. We wanted to enjoy lunch and catch up. Unfortunately, the music was so loud we couldn't hear each other and eventually got tired of trying to eat and yell at each other. The waitress got our order wrong probably because she couldn't hear us. The music was nice, reminded me of the dance club I went to the night before. The steak sandwich was excellent despite the burnt toast. She liked her chicken salad but the pita bread it came with was also burned.   The decor was nice and modern, which is part of the problem as beautiful as it is it amplifies sounds. I was thinking maybe I would try sitting outside next time but as I was leaving we noticed that the music was overwhelming there too.   I called to ask for a manager the next day. Apparently, all managers were in a meeting and was told they would call me back. So 2 more days later without a return call I called this time getting a manager. I didn't get an apology for no one returning my call or for the poor experience. If you want to eat in an atmosphere where management doesn't care that your head is pounding from the noise, straining your throat yelling at the people you're with and staff seem more interested in having a good time than providing good service then enjoy."}
{"text":"Big fan, really great food and awesome drinks. We stopped in late at night and they were super helpful at recommendations of what to order as well as where else to check out in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I want to love this place.. just can't quite make it my go to spot. Unfortunately, my experience with the staff had been with the classless and rude. Food is yes healthy, but mediocre. They have tasty unique cocktails, which are included on the happy hour.  I recommend the kale salad with chicken and kombucha cocktail"}
{"text":"Visited today for the first time, Amanda was my server,she recommended the \"Gilrs in the vineyard\" wine, and the Salmon. The two together paired perfect together. Amanda has a beautiful smile and was very nice. Answered all the questions I asked. Definitely coming back for the salmon and the wonderful service"}
{"text":"I really like this place! Came last Sunday night and was pleasantly surprised. How many places do you know of that offer kombucha cocktails? My meal  was refreshing and satisfying and definitely in alignment with clean eating whilst also being tasty! Definitely not your pick if you're looking for some comfort food, or wanna get overstuffed on large portions. This place is a pretty good representation of well balanced and nutritional food. Keep up the great work Farm + Craft. Can't wait to see the ways your menu changes once the seasons do! :)"}
{"text":"My experiences here have gotten worse and worse over time. Great space and menu, but the service is an absolute failure. Every time, consistently! Today, I put my name on the waitlist and was told the wait was around 5-10 minutes. My friend and I waited 30 minutes and watched people coming in after us getting seated with no reservations. When I confronted the hostess, she immediately became defensive and made up some ridiculous excuse about how I missed a text? So I showed her my phone, where I received a confirmation that I was in line but never that a table was ready. Then the manager got involved, who seemed to have an axe to grind. He said that I shouldn't take out my frustration on the hostess. Really? Maybe you should train your hostess to do her job, and to be accountable for her mistakes? I would highly recommend you reconsider giving this establishment their business, as they will not appreciate yours."}
{"text":"Cocktails =great  Food=yummy  Service = disaster   Super slow, disorganized, lack any understanding that they are a mess, no one is in charge ....   Patio had 6 tables but they ran around like there were 30 tables. Manager should be replaced or this place will be in trouble. Employees seemed out of control."}
{"text":"Bartender was SO rude. She made rude comments about patrons to these two rude women sitting next to us...or should I say young clueless girls. My fiancÃ© asked how far from the bar he needed to be to smoke (we are from Maryland) and the patrons all said \"we don't smoke in Scottsdale\" and told me I should lose some weight and -&: not focus on smoking! The bartender said nothing and continued to cater to rude patrons and be rude to us. SCOTTSDALE PRETENTIOUS AT ITS FINEST. We will never recommend, we as newly engaged and treated like complete SHIT.  Update as of 10/11/17: A manager, Kevin Berk, reached out to me immediately and had been in continuous communication, apologizing for our experience and assured me he will handle this situation.  Having said that, if Kevin is reflective of Farm & Craft, I would not hesitate to give this establishment another shot next time I am visiting Scottsdale. Unlike the bartender, Kevin has been extremely professional and his effort to make things right is exemplary. Thank you to Kevin for showing fantastic customer service. I can only move this from 1 star to 3 stars since I have yet to have another experience there but would imagine my next visit would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out for lunch. Gorgeous 75 degree weather. It has a patio (right on Scottsdale Road, which was dusty and noisy). We ate inside but all of the windows were open and it felt great! This is a fast casual situation where you order and then they bring it to you. Serves breakfast and has a full bat menu. I went this route...choose your protein: soy, chicken, beef, or salmon. And then about 15 sides $4ea. (I ordered salmon $7 and grilled brussel sprouts with bacon). Hubby ordered  turkey wrap. Food came quickly enough. My salmon was a smallish portion, about 3 ounces, but it was thick and perfectly cooked. I was disappointed that they didnt season it! The brussel sprouts were burnt on the outside and hard/uncooked on the inside... bacon was yummy :) hubby liked his well enough. His side salad was crisp and fresh with a very light, tasty dressing, but he said he was still hungry so he bought a $3 cookie. It was good! Not sure if we will be back to give them another try. There are just so many interesting places to eat, why settle?"}
{"text":"Farm and Craft is a great addition to the Valley's growing plethora of healthy fast-casual concepts.  Will it blow you away?  Probably not.  But it will give you an opportunity to fuel your body with healthy, fresh food in a fun, hip environment.  F&C's menu has changed over time for the better.  There are now plenty of options no matter what time of day you visit... from breakfast served all day, sandwiches, salads, bowls, etc... if you are open to eating healthy, you're sure to find something you like!  I recently went for the Greek Quinoa Salad with salmon and avocado and it was delicious.  I also recommend getting an Arnold Palmer with their homemade lavender lemonade.    Note: F&C prices are a little steep... (almost double what you'll pay next door at Chop Shop), but the quality is high, the service is friendly and patient, and it's nice to mix it up a bit!  Hope to return soon for some avocado + egg white protein toast."}
{"text":"LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! Today my boyfriend and I tried out this new health spot and both left knowing we'd be back very soon. I had the Open Faced Salmon on pita and he had the Kale Caesar with chicken. We kept nibbling off of each other's plates because both tasted SO good! The mac n cheese was also our favorite side, so we ended up ordering a second serving of it to go! We plan to visit this weekend for brunch and have no doubt it will be great!"}
{"text":"Cocktail game is strong at this place! They have several different cocktails served out of a watermelon! It's so cute and refreshing! Have you ever asked yourself, how could on tap kombucha be any better? The answer my friends, is alcohol. F & C has delightful kombucha cocktails. One for every mood. The cucumber one is amazing!! And also so cute! You could basically serve me a peanut and I'd be happy after those cocktails but this place actually has great food! Sure it's all organic-y and pricey but you get what you pay for. Only complaint is avocado toast is tiny. What is this, avocado toast for ants!? Service is great, restaurant is a beaut. Drink the cute cocktails and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Healthy food that actually taste really good! The decor is adorable as well. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Best spinach dip!   Ask for pita bread on the side.  Yummy   Perfect day to sit out on the patio and enjoy a cocktail or two."}
{"text":"Hello friends!  I have been wanting to try farm and craft for a long time and have now been able to go twice in the last week or so.   The restaurant is supposed to be full service after 3pm and my friend and I found it to be so the first visit but yesterday it seemed as if they were understaffed so they told us  we had to order at that counter until 5pm.  My girlfriend and I had to open up several different tabs   yesterday for drink refills which was quite inconvenient (luckily we were paying cash).  The first time I had their rustic salmon bowl which was pretty good but I did have to add tapitio hot sauce (could have used a little more flavor and I am used to eating very clean and basic).  The most recent visit I had a strawberry salad with goat cheese and salmon and this was AHHMAZING!   Literally everything I dreamed of and more.  My friend got the salmon rustic bowl and she told me again it needed a bit more pizazz.  There was also no sunflower seeds in her bowl (they are listed on the menu) and we were told they were out.  Being in the industry I understand that things run out but sunflower seeds are inexpensive and easily sourced.  Both times we have visited we have asked for the artichoke dip out prior to our meals, but neither time did this happen (it came out with the entrees).  We love to sit on the patio to watch the people in old town and overall this is a good experience.  We will likely be back (we do love to eat clean and enjoy the atmosphere) but do have lower expectations and think for the price and the restaurant  group bringing us this concept things could be much better."}

{"text":"I've been here twice in the last 6 weeks and both times have been great! The food is delicious and the atmosphere is light and fun. Perfect for a weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"With fresh menu options, it is an excellently delicious choice for vegetarians and vegans (as well as meat-eaters)!!!  Lots of variety and easy to customize your meal whatever your taste or mood might be!  Great atmosphere and interior design as well."}
{"text":"Great service, yummy cold brew coffee, and a very tasty brunch. I had the protein toast and my daughter had the strawberry salad. We loved both!"}
{"text":"Place is pretty good! Love the decor and vibe the environment sets off. Very casual but modern. I came during lunch time and found plenty healthy options to choose from. I ended up ordering the steak goat cheese and strawberries salad it was really good and filling. Perfect portion sizes. I would recommend coming to try this place out when you are in old town."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Very cute design. Love the open design and the patio. We have had some problems with some of the staff when ordering to go food. I did call at one point and talk to a manager he was fantastic and handled everything. I know mistakes happen but it is how a company deals with them and this manager was great. But because we have issues with almost every order I can't give 5 stars. Someone did tell me a couple of the girls at the front were new and still being trained. Hoping everything thing gets fix and this will be a fantastic place!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to eat in Scottsdale. The food is fresh and delish! The vibe is light and upbeat. I love all the fresh juices and kombucha based alcoholic drinks. The strawberry shot is a favorite! It's a great place to eat or drink anytime of day/night. Great for couples and family. It's has a little something for everyone"}
{"text":"I never write yelp reviews, but i feel that Farm & Craft deserves one. With so much competition in the valley, I was hesitant F&C would be over shadowed... Boy was I wrong! This place is killer! I have become a bit addicted, and am working my way through the menu. Here are my favorites from each section of the menu so far-  Bowls: Rustic Farm Bowl served with basil kale pesto.. such a game changer! Wraps: Turkey Wrap is UNREAL. The flax pita is truly the best I have had in the valley. It has a little sweet kick which I love.  Build Your Own: Vegan Honey Roasted Carrots... words cannot describe how delicious these are! I had to order two extra sides after the first time I had them! I also got the Sweet Potato Hash, Farro Mac & Cheese, and the Garbanzo beans and goat cheese, with chicken. All super tasty!  Salads: KALE CESAR. Living in the scottsdale/arcadia area, the word \"kale\" has become as popular as water at restaurants. However, this is the best kale salad hands down!!!   I also tried the chocolate protein shake yesterday and it was so delicious. Sweet but refreshing, and healthy!   I have never felt so passionate about a new concept! It is seriously amazing every time I go in. I love how from open-3pm it is fast casual, but then 3pm- close is full service. It is the perfect balance because sometimes Friday night rolls around and you want healthy food, but still a nice, fun environment. Farm & Craft is the place!!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken salad wrap and it was delicious! The fruity healthy drinks are very tasty as well. However beware that the twang of them is a little more prominent than one would think. For example one of them has jalapeÃ±os in it and the after taste of them is stronger than I thought. However they were wonderful! We enjoyed the scenery and atmosphere as well. Wait staff was kind! It was definitely a happenin' place!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place! I felt, sitting at the outside bar, very cool. Like I could sit and sip delicious cocktails all afternoon and have interesting chats with fun strangers. I did an a la carte lunch which was both healthy and super delicious! and I also had menu-envy of my friends' salad, and about everything I saw on everyone else's plate. I have ZERO complaints. Great food, great service, great ambiance, amazing. DEFINITELY going back on the regular!"}
{"text":"I ate at Farm & Craft yesterday and was extremely disappointed by the portion size and overall quality. I ordered an $8 aÃ§aÃ­ bowl which for the price should be a full meal. Instead, the bowl barely passed as snack. This is coming from a small 5'2 female. After finishing the aÃ§aÃ­ bowl I was still hungry, so I went back and ordered the side of eggs. I was again disappointed by the size and quality. I understand that the restaurant concept is farm to table and that the food will be more expensive and portion size smaller. However, if I am paying more I expect to receive a full portion for the amount that I am paying."}
{"text":"Had a kombucha cucumber cocktail for the first time-very refreshing. Service was excellent. Very hip and trendy, healthy \"wellness menu.\" Loved the ambiance. Tried the steak bowl and farro Mac n Cheese. All around goodness!"}
{"text":"Love the paleo brownies.  Awesome concept with the menu.  Best peanut butter beer i have ever had!  Service wasn't the best ,  waited for a long time to be greeted at table and beer didn't come out before food, but they comped the beer so it made up for it!  Will be back for  the brownies again!"}
{"text":"Long day golfing and water park. Finished with dinner here and absolutely loved it. Staff went out of the way to get us seated quickly and the food was AMAZING per our friends daughter. Loved it!"}
{"text":"My steak was under cooked, and same steak was put on the  oven and came back black, customer service isn't great."}
{"text":"We were so excited after reading the menu. Once the food started coming it wasn't what we thought. No flavor, seems like most food was prepared ahead of time and warmed up. The pasta had zero flavor, steak tasted like airplane food, flatbreads zero flavor and undercooked. The waiter was very nice. It wasn't his fault that the food was awful. The host took the flatbread off of our bill which was very nice of him. Good staff, awful food. The desserts were horrendous too. For example, the brownie was super dry with no flavor. May have been paleo but it's possible to make it good."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from Farm &  craft during a team planning summit. I spent quite a bit of time perusing the menu and looking at Yelp photos and based on what I read and saw my breakfast was just as expected! It was tasty and healthy and it was still warm! I'd definitely come back in for a healthy breakfast as a dine in customer."}
{"text":"Really good food and tasted absolutely delicious. However, I am giving only 3 stars because I could have gotten the same exact meal for half the price down the street at modern market. I guess I should have read some of the reviews before going because it definitely is overpriced."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this cute little restaurant is amazing, it gives you a very relaxed vacation like vibe with a lot of light coming in and amazing attention to detail when it comes to the decor and their brand. It's a great place to grab a nice healthy breakfast, lunch or brunch. We ordered their Vegan ceviche which was combination of yellow beets, avocado and radish. It came with crackers. I think it's a little too pricey for what it is, but tasty non the less. I tried the Matcha-Mule drink (non-alcoholic). It was refreshing, but not my favorite, I would not order again. The juice tastes like a combination of green juice with straight ginger  beer soda and the flavors did not compliment each other as well as I would have liked.  Overall I think the atmosphere makes up for any falls and I am definetly planning on coming back for some lunch items."}
{"text":"Friend of my wife won a happy hour here so we decided to check it out. Neither of us are into the \"bar scene\" but we really enjoyed this place. It had a great atmosphere with a different setting than a typical bar and really felt a little more upscale and relaxed at the same time. It felt more like a lounge than a bar and I felt like maybe it was missing someone singing smooth jazz in the corner.    Either way, the drinks were awesome. I had the Wellness Martini and the Mrs had the Rose' All Day. And the chicken and kale pesto pizza/flatbread was really good too. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Super cute restaurant, casual service and amazing drinks! However the menu is limited and sever had a hard time answering questions about the menu. Overall a good experience though and the sever made up for the lack of knowledge with his hospitality"}
{"text":"The tocoa steak bowl was a superb choice for me. I must admit I am a picky eater and a lot of the things that were in the bowl I knew I probably wouldn't like and to my surprise I loved every part of it! Every single flavor complimented one another. The presentation of the food was also perfect! My friend had a steak sandwich and she ate every piece of it so I am sure she enjoyed her dish as much as I enjoyed mine. The only thing I would not recommend is the Mac & cheese. The texture seemed quite odd to me. Other than that the atmosphere is awesome and the service was nice as well! I will definitely be coming back to try the kombucha cocktails!"}
{"text":"This place is poppin'!!! We arrived in the early evening and there were no empty seats.  This placed attracted gym goers, shoppers, drinkers, hipsters, etc.  Parents brought their children to enjoy the food.   The food was on point! I enjoyed the Cali chicken bowl, which I would highly recommend.    The only con was that the server neglected us.  I had to call up another server to grab our server.    I will not drop their scoring over a horrible waitress.  Therefore, I will return."}
{"text":"I wish I could eat here every weekend for brunch. The ambiance was trendy in an open air environment and I didn't want to leave.   The health focused philosophy of the menu is genius and I wish more restaurants were like this. I really loved the cheat sheet of different types of diets to promote a variety of healthy living lifestyles.   I ordered a mimosa and it had the kind of OJ with the perfect amount of pulp. It was probably hand squeezed and soooo flavorful.  For food I had the breakfast burrito and my friend got the burger which was good too. The burrito came wrapped in a whole wheat think tortilla that was unlike anything I've had before. Very fresh and delicious. The burger wasn't overly huge but just enough to fill you up. Cooked to a nice medium and had all kinds of fixings to make it good.  I left there feeling like I had indulged in a healthy way...the best feeling!"}
{"text":"Brought my best friend here for dinner since we were in the area. I had heard about this place from IG actually and bookmarked in on Yelp. It was the perfect dining spot because my friend was just starting her cleanse and I was looking into healthier options.   Once arrived we were told the inside seating would be a wait but we could be seated outside. We chose to do so and there were plenty outdoor heaters to keep us warm. We decided on the avocado hummus for an appetizer and two kumbuchas for drinks.   Our waiter returns to tell us 20 mins later that the kitchen is running behind and the food is taking longer than usual. I didn't mind and appreciated the follow up except I think he forgot about our hummus.  We kept waiting and our hummus arrived about 10 more minutes later. It was very enjoyable and perfect because we hadn't eaten since breakfast. Our entrees came out fairly quickly after.   I ordered the roasted chicken and she chose the chicken farro mac n cheese bowl. My cauliflower mash was delectable but the chicken was slightly over cooked. My friends chicken was very dry. She made a comment about it but didn't want to send it back because we were starving as it is. She finished her plate anyway but I felt bad about it   I ordered us the paleo brownies for dessert. It was different but good. It's definitely an acquired taste.   I would like to return back to try their brunch options!"}
{"text":"So glad they opened up a new Farm & Craft location that is much closer to me. I was in the area with my dog and decided to stop in for brunch, remembering from my previous Farm & Craft visit at the Scottsdale location that they are dog friendly! They are very much dog friendly! We were invited to have a seat anywhere on the patio, and after sitting down, someone came and brought my dog: Bailey her own water bowl and also mentions that they have toys for her to play with as well! She was happy to be outside. They even came and asked to take pictures of her and had an option for her to dine with me offering a \"dog bowl\" which consists of chicken and grains. I ordered the protein toast which is essentially an avocado toast with scrambled eggs on top and it came with a side salad. Everything was so good! Bailey and I will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"If I could do a negative star I would. While I did not sit down and eat here, I stopped by and got a lemonade to go. 12 oz, they said they used honey instead of sugar as a sweetener so I was good with that. Guess how the drink cost me....$3...no.....$4....no......$5.49....yes. For LEMONADE!?  I asked the server why? They looked at me like I asked them who the president elect is. I am rarely critical of a restaurant, as I want to see Scottsdale's restaurants succeed. But, it seems like there are misguided greedy people in the business.  This place epitomizes the reputation Scottsdale has for being pretentious.   For now, I don't trust the team at F&C and won't eat there. They won't care though as they have enough customers (for now) to keep the lights on.  Vote with your dollar folks."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had.  Had to wait ten minutes just to get on a waiting list when we were the only people in line.  When we did get seated we had to ask for water twice and condiments for our food were never offered. We had to walk over to where there sauces were to get them for our food.  They never offered half and half or milk for our coffee until we had to ask. The staff sits around and seriously just talks and \"hangs out \" with each other. It's a very disorganized staff. Don't eat here unless you have patience for people who don't understand how to do their job."}
{"text":"Had brunch here with a few girlfriends and we all loved it. Awesome service Greeted and seated very quickly, even had a manager come over and introduce herself and asked about our meals. Cocktails are a must try. Had the farm house flatbread, definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Disappointing. We ordered the steak sandwich - it was supposed to come with grilled sweet peppers, but someone messed up and put in grilled jalapenos instead.  So hot - it was inedible! I tried to get someone to fix it for us,  and the staff acted like we were out of line.  She wanted to know what number we were given when we ordered (30 something??),  where was my receipt (She threw it away!)... what's the big deal? Not helpful AT ALL.   We ordered a flatbread.  Bread was soggy. Gross.  The layout is a little confusing,  too. You can't see the cocktail menu when you come in,  so you order food and find your own seat.  I saw the bar, and walked over once we found a table.  I was was totally ignored.  The bartender said nothing to me while I'm clearly standing there to help a couple that got there after me.  It was obvious she was purposely skipping me.  She didn't apologize.    I will not return."}
{"text":"The costumer service here is amazing!! Everyone is always happy and so kind. I love everyone's good mood and the environment! It's my favorite place to take the family on weekends."}
{"text":"We were in town for two days and needed a dog friendly place. Weird that most restaurants in Scottsdale (tried Monarch & Fnb) we're not ! (Service dog only and we chEck papers!!  didn't let you order out Weird.. ) so this place was very accommodating! Bar menu was excellent! Bartender not so.. but drink was really good. Came there for the watermelon but it they were out. Hummm juice bar 30 feet behind you.. but both my choice drink and the wine were great! Shared the salmon and strawberry goat nut salad was the bomb! Hostess had the mostest!! Great lil town there lots of nightlife and almost everyone in Scottsdale were really friendly ! Fun trip and made the long drive back to LA almost bearable !"}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly and cute! The food was so good it was hard to believe it was healthy too!! Ordered the artichoke dip and the roast chicken and ate every bite. I will go back and try brunch one day!!"}
{"text":"Great healthy meals, good alternative to most eateries w \"healthy options\"  loved their cocktails and food,  atmosphere was on point as well"}
{"text":"8-30-17 Food was really Good. Brussels Sprouts were awesome,Spinach Dip, farm raised Chicken, Cauliflower Mash too die for! Would have given 5 star but the flies were untameable and because were during lunch/dinner change the fast casual service was weird...guess we wanted waiter service. I would love to eat here again though!"}
{"text":"Ate here with a friend on a recent Sunday morning around 10:30 a.m. I like the menu and focus on healthy options. Had a good vegetable drink and the power porridge which was red quinoa with blueberries, bananas, honey, almond milk, and coconut. Friend liked his egg dish. Would give it a better rating if the music wasn't so wrong for a Sunday brunch. They were playing club music that you might expect at 1a.m. not 10 a.m. Plus it was so loud we could not have a conversation. I felt like they were playing the music for a hungover staff not patrons wanting a nice brunch on a beautiful day. We had to ask them to turn it down twice but they really didn't drop the volume much. It seemed like other guests around us found it annoying too."}
{"text":"Always love the idea of a restaurant that aims to provide healthy and sustainable foods, but for Farm & Craft they could use a bit of improvement to elevate the experience I saw while dining there.   The restaurant itself was super cute, I felt like I could post a picture of it on Instagram and get a lot of likes (i.e. the Affection Wall) and I'm sure that's what they were going for. The day we went it was unseasonably cold and for some reason they kept leaving the door to the outside open. I know the table next to us complained about it and at one point one of my family members got up and closed it ourselves. It was a bit ridiculous.   We tried to order the drinks served in the small watermelons, but they were sold out (bummer). No biggie, we ordered the grapefruit Paloma drinks - however that was a letdown. Talk about all looks and no actual drink in the grapefruit. Such a letdown, especially for $11.   My food was actually pretty decent, I got the salmon poke bowl. I loved the marinade on the salmon and how fresh all the ingredients were. We also got the spinach and artichoke dip and I was also a fan of that! I had never thought to serve it with carrots but it worked."}
{"text":"Farm and Craft is absolutely delicious. The Kombucha cocktails are amazing. Would definitely recommend checking out this new restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place! Came on Sat afternoon around 2pm and it had a decent crowd. We were seated right away outside on the patio. I got the Cucumber Kombucha cocktail and it was SO good. I would have gotten a 2nd but it was $12 so I figured I shouldn't since I could get one of my go-to bottle of wines at the grocery store for less. For my meal, I got the Turkey Wrap and it was so good! And its a pretty large size, I left stuffed! It was $11 & worth it. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Service was absolutely terrible. Some of the worst I have ever experienced. They were friendly, but everything took forever. We sat at a table and it took about ten minutes to be greeted, ordered drinks and those took about 30-45 minutes minutes to come from the bar. The water took about half that time. We ordered food and that came at a reasonable time. We tried to get in another drink order, but after being there for a total of just under two hours we were ready to get out of there. It took a while to see our server to ask for the check, but was quick once we were ready to pay.   Food was good.The prices were fair for everything including drinks and portion sizes were filling.  Everything seemed to be overly health themed and still came out cooked with plenty of butter and carbs as at most restaurants. The vibe makes everyone here think they are making healthy options.   Overall would not recommend to anyone, and will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food is great but there is a young man with glasses and a mustache and a young platinum blonde girl that work the front counter usually and they're the worst. They don't greet guests. Instead they look at people that walk in like they're bothering them. After they're done making them feel unwelcome, they can't perform the basic function of entering the orders into the computer to save their life. They'll ask you to repeat yourself several times and move as quickly as molasses. TO ENTER A STRAWBERRY GOAT CHEESE SALAD WITH NO MODIFICATIONS. WHY IS THAT SO HARD. This happens every single time. Newsflash you're not a model paid to pout. You work at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Serious right now?  $6.00 for a regular large iced t?  You are OUT OF YOUR MIND.  Food, So So.  ordered the oatmeal to go, $6.00 in a tiny container and far too much Tureric.    I chose Chop Shop.  Prices are out to lunch here!!!!!"}
{"text":"It is so nice to have healthier food options for dining out and not be confined to salads at a regular restaurant.  I loved the steak sandwich and the Kombucha on tap.            The service and the food is great. The prices are affordable.  I will definitely be going back for more."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere! Great crushed ice! Great service! Great Cheese Burger! The rest, it's not my deal. But if you like fresh made weird Scottsdale quinoa, and farrow cale, fresh veggies squished into juice... this is your spot.  Great location and a great music. Did I mention a great cheeseburger... enjoy!"}
{"text":"I really want one of these to open on the east coast!    The food selection is so fresh, definitely farm to table done right.  I had the kombucha-cucumber cocktail and it was so light, refreshing, and delicious.    One of the biggest highlights is the atmosphere.  It's industry chic meets clean minimalist.  It is open air so you get to enjoy the nice weather while being shaded.    I can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Quaint and softly rustic, Farm and Craft located in a cute little neighborhood we arrived around 11:00 on a Tuesday. Ordering at the counter and given a number, our meals were brought a few minutes later. My salmon bowl was delicious! My hubby got a breakfast plate of eggs, sausage and sweet potato hash, and commented it was good. We each got a cold-pressed juice, made earlier in the day, and a bag of coconut cookies.  There's a full bar and the menu offers nice variety. There's indoor and outdoor seating, I'd imagine in the cooler months the outside seating would be quite nice.  Lunch for 2 meals, 2 juices and a bag of Paleo cookies was $65, minus tip."}
{"text":"Farm & Craft has a great vibe! The staff is upbeat and very knowledgeable!  The food was excellent AND healthy! It is a fun and unique concept, almost as unique as their signature cocktails(I had the Kombucha and Tequila)!  The steak sandwich is killer, and I would also recommend their Mac and cheese!  My new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. The atmosphere is just perfect good colors and seating lighting. All around a good look. The humus was amazing served with carrots and pita bread you can't go wrong. I ordered the vegan pizza and I will say as much as this could have been good the flavor combination was not for me. The waitress who had amazing service noticed I wasn't eating and took it off the check! Service on point there. Didn't have to do that and that shows they take pride in their cooking. I would go back and try something else. My boyfriend who is gluten free had so many things to choose from and got the lasagna it was gluten free and he said it was delicious. The Mac and cheese also gluten free was also wonderful. So although I didn't enjoy the pizza this didn't have anything to do with it not being good just the olives and peppers weren't my thing in a combination. I would try this out a little overpriced but it's worth it once and a while for healthy eating and food atmosphere we will be back"}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere, waiters, and drinks were all so amazing. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy food focused on the anti-inflammatory diet! The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is due to the lack of service. It was very slow to be waited on and delivered our food."}
{"text":"First and foremost, my friends and I have been wanting to try this place out for quite some time. The ambiance is the ONLY thing that is saving this place. The food is tasteless and bland. I understand it's farm to table approach, but being from the Bay Area and having access to TRUE farm to table cuisine, this place doesn't come close! The staff isn't much better. Andrew (he's vegan btw), was AMAZING! Our waitress however, was rude and was not present. We only interacted with her once (to take our order), but she seemed to have vanished during her shift. No hi. No \"hello I'm so and so and I'll be helping you tonight\". NADA. We will never be coming back to Farm and Craft. Overpriced and to be honest, Chop Shop next door is the same style cuisine for half the price and is terrific!"}
{"text":"Great healthy food, small portions though. Great ambiance. We went for lunch on a Sunday, we're seated and the waiter and host forgot about us. We had to let them know we're still waiting to be served. The food came out pretty fast and was delicious. Would probably go back with the girls only, the boys complained about the portion size. Again the food tastes fresh and terrific."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Not only do they have an exceedingly healthy menu, but they further assist the health conscious by labeling items with specific benefits, such as probiotic increase or anti-inflammatory properties. The fresh made juices are also delicious and very nutritious. It reminds me of a Chop Shop or Flower Child, only classier.   I highly recommend the Cali Chicken bowl and Grilled Pineapple & Bacon Flatbread! We ordered the latter as an appetizer for the table, and upon the first bite, immediately regretted not getting one for myself (as did everyone else at the table!).  The ambience is inviting and intriguing, making this dining experience great for a romantic date or a family gathering. Additionally, they were very accommodating to our party of five. We arrived 12 minutes before the kitchen closed, and they obliged our orders and took our picture even. I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys healthy cuisine that tastes amazing."}
{"text":"Food great (small portions tho), Atmosphere great, Service good, but prices little too high to eat there often."}
{"text":"I've been twice now and this place is awesome! Great tasting healthy food and a fun place to hang out for dinner with friends!"}
{"text":"Great food, always very fresh, but the service continues to be disappointing.  Each time we visit it takes at least 20 minutes to get our order.  I recommend the ahi poke bowl and the steak bowl, but don't go if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"If your out and about in Scottsdale this is the place to eat ! Amazing food and amazing service !! If you like burgers try theirs you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch spots in Scottsdale! It's a charming space, food is fresh, healthy, and they won't disappoint whether you are here for just cocktails or brunch. Everything is made from scratch, including all juices. If you are vegetarian, vegan or gluten-free, no fear, you will have options. They are extremely accommodating with any food allergies or sensitivities."}
{"text":"I am stoked about the new location of Farm & Craft! First of all, the space is beautiful. Patterned tile, raw wood, classy upholstered chairs and metallic details. It is warm, modern and inviting. Second, the menu. They have loads of gluten free, vegetarian and even anti-inflammatory options. Third, they have a full bar including a vast array of hand crafted cocktails and kombucha cocktails I can't wait to try. I ordered the breakfast sandwich on gluten free bread. It was buttery, cheesy and delicious. The bread was toasted to perfection, which is an absolute must when working with gluten free bread.  I also tried their cold brew coffee which they have on tap. Delicious. This will for sure become a regular spot for me! Very impressed."}
{"text":"Wow here again now late afternoon for a Flatbread selection and Pelligrino drink. This appears to be a really good time to do this. Early for dinner crowd. Not many here now. Lovely lasses working here. So my food of chicken, kale, artichoke and broccoli...wow. Best I've had ever."}
{"text":"No regrets! Food is delicious! Amazing service and great atmosphere! Farm to Table and Freshness to Goodness! 5+star!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim for happy hour, a great HH menu at a good price! Wait staff and the manager very attentive! A new concept worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Was starving so basically ordered everything on the menu. 5 stars all around. If you don't get the steak sandwich - you're losing. Same with the farro Mac n cheese. And 8 other things. But mostly the kombucha and tequila cocktail. Finally someone got it right jn Scottsdale. Do it."}
{"text":"What a wonderful healthy place to eat. The food was delicious and service was great. Their juices were awesome and fresh. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great fresh place! Their menu was beautifully crafted with some awesome clean choices. Their drinks are so unique too!"}
{"text":"The food has beyond exceeded all of my expectations!! Absolutely incredible! Not to mention the chic and comforting atmosphere!   10 stars"}
{"text":"Had a bad morning the other day and decided I needed a bloody mary and decent breakfast.  Weather was nice and I ran across Farm & Craft.  Decor....very hip and fresh.  Big doors and windows open bring the outside in very nicely. Absolutely no complaints about the building.  The food and drink wasn't bad, but wasn't great.  The eggs were overdone. The bloody mary wasn't what you expect in the age of \"who can make the best bloody.\"  Again.....not terrible.  Just not memorable.  You really need memorable smack dab in the middle of Old Town."}
{"text":"Concept here is farm to table and they did it perfectly. Interior and decor is modern and inviting. It's a very health conscious menu with many different ingredients and ideas. The staff was attentive and helpful. My friend and I both enjoyed our meals here. My only suggestion would be to give more steak in the steak bowl. Everything was fantastic, but I feel like I barely had any steak."}
{"text":"I come here at least 3 to 4 times a week. Saying I love this place would be an understatement. I love the friendly staff especially my girl Tia. This place is great for any occasion, post gym healthy dinner, a casual drink, or even a Sunday funday!!   My go to is the strawberry and goat salad, always a winner and Always and forever will be back!"}
{"text":"I came to Farm&Craft one morning while I was in town and If you love healthy foods and you're a health freak like me then you will go absolutely crazy for this place. Totally wish they had an establishment like this in San Diego. If you're into kombucha then they have a huge variety of kombucha and alcoholic beverages. How cool is that? The food is good but I wasn't blown away. I ordered the avocado toast which came with a poached egg on top and with a side of sweet potatoes. I also ordered a side of bacon and a chocolate protein smoothie drink. There was a long wait for the food but it was understandable that there was a lot of huge parties there as well. I would return again if I am in town to try out the other items."}
{"text":"The poke bowl was deliciously fresh!  Would 100% recommend this dish and the Farm & Craft establishment!  Great patio with a nice bar!  I would eat here again for sure!"}
{"text":"Ordered the quinoa salad, Brussels sprouts with bacon, and Mac and cheese. Everything was delicious. The atmosphere is fun, if your a family dining there, on a first date, or out for happy hour. Farm and craft is an all around place!"}
{"text":"Would rate it lower but giving it 3 stars because of the Brussels sprouts & my server Andrew.   Ordered salmon & Brussel sprouts & the salmon was raw on the inside & my boyfriends was overcooked. I asked Andrew if I could have it cooked a little longer & I was given another salmon fillet that was unseasoned.   Brussels sprouts were amazing, & Andrew was friendly, attentive & was very knowledgeable on the menu."}
{"text":"This place was beautiful! The decor was very fresh. We sat outside and enjoyed the weather. The food was good. Everything was very fresh and full of flavor. Our waiter was pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"I've had my eye on Farm & Craft since before they opened, but I just got the chance to give it a try for brunch this morning! Everything was fresh, and the vibes are adorable as can be! I ordered the American Breakfast - complete with scrambled egg whites, sweet potato hash, and chicken sausage. I was really impressed with the plate, and felt like the price was right for this area and the portion size. My friends and I also split the protein pancakes... YUM, they were sooo delicious - I would definitely recommend these! Not sure how healthy they could actually be, but it was the perfect sweet treat to top off our meal!  Aside from the vibes and tasty food, our server lacked in helpfulness and enthusiasm. As first timers, we hoped for better guidance on the menu and questions that we had. In addition to this, she wasn't very friendly in the slightest about it all. Regardless, I'll be back! But at a hip and trendy place like this, that has everything going for them, I hope this is one area they improve upon!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes and expectations when we arrived for dinner. Inside and outside dining was about half full and so was the bar. Clearly a millennial hangout, which didn't bother me as I had my 2 millennial daughters with me. As we were seated, it was announced Jake would be our waiter. After a bit, he got our drink order but more like he announced he'd get us waters. 10 minutes later, a young lady brought our water with Jake in tow. He took out order. I ordered chicken and dubbed out the cauliflower mash for sweet potato hash, daughter 1 orders chicken sausage penne and 2nd daughter orders chicken tacos and a side of sweet potato hash.  20 minutes later, Jake saunters by asking if we'd like salt or hot sauce?  Salt, Jake. He brings it by and then 10 minutes later our food arrives. A 30 minute wait time? Here's where the wheels really fall off the wagon. The chicken is vile. Vulgar. Disgusting. Imagine biting into a pill of amoxicillin and Benadryl. At that point, my pallet is blown out and I am done eating. Before I eat the chicken, I taste the pasta. It's undente. As in not cooked. The sweet potato hash is made up of various sizes and doneness.  Some cooked. Some raw.  Jake finally wanders by after continually flirting and playing with his girlfriend at the bar. I had a clear shot of the show my entire visit. I inform him how disgusting the chicken was. The \"manager?\" comes over and offers to replace. Nope, I'm done. He brings the check and has removed my dinner and sweet potato hash. It takes another 10 minutes for someone to come get my payment. Suffice to say, I will not be returning nor recommending Farm and Craft. Ever...."}
{"text":"Let me start off this review by saying this place has SO much potential. My husband and I were so excited to see it pop up in Scottsdale and were immediately convinced it would be one of our new favorite spots just from the looks of it. Through the grapevine, we had heard some lackluster reviews about the place, but decided to give it a try for lunch today anyways.   First things first, the ambience of this place is awesome. It's so cute and charming, airy and perfect for the beautiful days we (finally) get this time of year. I love it- from the decor to the bar to the music they play. It all fits together and is just a great place to be, especially when it's nice and busy like it was today at lunch. It's so cute, in fact, that we were absolutely shocked to find out its owned by the same group that owns whiskey row & el hefe. The concepts couldn't be more different!  Now what makes this place three stars... 1) service was alright but nothing special. It's a little confusing to tell if it's a sit down restaurant with service or a place you order up at the counter at. When push comes to shove, I'd much rather have just ordered at the counter and not paid a tip for the sparse service we received.  2) the food. I'm so sad to say that the food we received was average at best. I had read some reviews before we came that had stated time and time again hat the portions were small, which we were okay with since we expected it, but wow not even a little mixed greens come with an 11 dollar wrap? Crazy. I ordered the turkey wrap and was horribly unimpressed. The wrap itself honestly tasted (and held up) like a store bought flatbread wheat wrap with hardly any flavor. The iceberg lettuce and big chunks of under-ripened tomato didn't help either. I get that this place is healthy and I appreciated hummus being the \"sauce\" for the wrap, but the whole thing ended up being so bland and underwhelming that I was bummed to have bought it. My husband ordered the steak sandwich, which was admittedly much better due to the horseradish sauce, peppers, and marinated onions. They should add some of those elements (or something with more flavor) to the turkey wrap.   Side note that the cold brew coffee was bomb! I ordered the small which was plenty and I enjoyed it a lot. Great taste, and doesn't leave you feeling TOO hyped up on caffeine.   We will likely be back for drinks & to enjoy the location & decor, but not for food. With so many awesome brunch places in Scottsdale, this place needs to step its game up. I'd equate the cost of this place to a ChopShop or FlowerChild, and they both have way larger portions of absolutely delicious healthy & fresh food!"}
{"text":"Grapefruit Greyhound and protein toast (my first avocado toast experience... I'm so behind the curve...) loved them both! The atmosphere was breezy and the place is gorgeous. My boyfriend was disappointed in his sweet potato hash (undercooked and underseasoned). But I'd go back over and over for what I had!"}
{"text":"Great dinner.  The Caesar salad was the bomb!  Shaved Brussels sprouts over a generous portion of kale with sun dried tomatoes topped by large salmon filet. My drink was refreshing and herbaceous.  Heathy ingredients bursting with flavor.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Farm and Craft is focused on healthy and sustainable food including fresh juices, anti-inflammatory diets, and an inviting indoor outdoor bar. I especially love the herringbone floor and all the cute little accents. Their menu is simple, and I highly recommend one of their fresh juice cocktails served inside a watermelon or grapefruit.  I had the protein pancakes which had blueberries baked inside, and was topped with strawberries and local granola. It came with a coconut agave syrup which I really enjoyed. I loved the crunch of granola. Usually I get bored with pancakes but these were great and balance just the right amount of sweetness, and it wasn't too candy-like. I left feeling really good, not full and exhausted. I think that's what Farm and Craft does well, serve food that makes you feel good."}
{"text":"Servers were nice but not good.  We waited a long time for food, which was weird considering that they weren't busy and only a few people eating.  First server took order and delivered food entrees, told us our side of mac n' cheese would be forthcoming.  I had the steak sandwich.  It fell apart when I took my first bite because bread was soggy.  Waited for server to come back so I could request a wrap to replace my soggy bread, but server never checked back on us.  About ten minutes later, (after my friend had finished eating) another server delivered the mac n' cheese.  I requested the wrap which she promised she would get, but it never happened.  So after another ten minutes, I gave up on that and ate my steak with a fork. My friend substituted a gluten free wrap for which they up-charged $2.50.   Bill came to $37 for two sandwiches, a side of mac n' cheese, and a beverage.  Cool concept, but over-priced and poorly executed."}
{"text":"Finally a restaurant/bar in the heart of old town Scottsdale that has great food, awesome vibes and is incredibly healthy. This is my new favorite spot! Highly recommend you check it out!"}
{"text":"the food is terrible. just really really terrible. i got 2 of their bowls. the proteins looked like they were pulled out from under a couch cushion. they were flat, super dry, and way overcooked. i wont discuss the overcooked vegetables, but they weren't any better.  yes, i get it. it's healthy - so it doesnt have to taste good. the true food/chop shop genre paved the way in that regard. but farm & craft isnt even healthy. my veggies were inexplicably saturated in cheese. and their health drinks and kombucha were all mixed with tequila and vodka. i'm sure you can get it non alcoholic as well, but it wasn't on the menu.  they used the restaurant name madlibs of 5 years ago: \"buzzword & buzzword\".  \"farm\": don't use the word if you can't pay proper respect to your produce. having reclaimed wood in your decor doesn't cut it.   \"craft\": your restaurant is crafted beautifully. your designer did a great job. the decor flows seamlessly from inside to the patio. i wish the same detail and attention were given to the menu.  maybe \"farm & craft\" is meant to describe the decor and not the food. but for such a down-to-earth vibe, it's as fake as the boobs on my waitress."}
{"text":"Healthy food doesn't have to be bland and tasteless. Unfortunately Farm and Craft didn't get that message. We recently went there for dinner and drinks. Several of us got the Steak Tacoa along with the Farrow Mac and Cheese. The Steak was dry and under seasoned and the farro with the dish was bland. The only semi redeeming part was the cole slaw, and that was on par with what you'd expect for decent cole slaw. We also tried the wild mushroom flatbread which I was looking forward to because it looked great. Came with a heap of arugala on it and the crust had a nice char. Unfortunately it fell flat with the first bite. The sauce had a strange sweet and sour taste to it (not the typical tomato-y delicious acidic sweetness but something else) and the crust was strange and had an unpleasant taste and chew. I think they were trying too hard to make it \"healthy\". The final insult was the Farro \"Mac\" and Cheese. There was no Mac. It was just cheese sauce and farro. It was also decent, probably the best part of the meal by comparison. However the cheese sauce was a bit grainy (either tasted powdered or like they didn't prepare the roux correctly). It, like everything else, was also under seasoned.  We got drinks as well. They were out of the Berry Slim and Trim so several of us got The Cure. After tasting it we all agreed that is was the cure...for not wanting to drink again. I love veggie juices and juice at home regularly, including with kale and cucumber. Something about this was just off. Also, there was barely any vodka in it. If it's gonna taste terrible at least make it strong! Another friend got one of the Kombucha cocktails, that was actually quite good compared to everything else.   The service was good so at least there was that. There was also a DJ blasting music which was a little weird for dinner at a \"health food\" restaurant, however the music he played was pretty awesome. We all agreed he was the best part of the evening and that Farm and Craft should ditch their kitchen, fire their mixologist (or let him/her make some better flavor combinations) and just turn the place into a club.  Will be sticking with Flower Child and Pomegranate Cafe for my future healthy outings."}
{"text":"This is really between 3 & 4 stars for me, but ultimately it's the food/menu that counts (which is the part I really liked), so I'll go on the higher side :)  For whatever reason I've avoided this place since it opened, but a friend wanted to go here for lunch recently so I said sure why not. It reminds me a lot of Flower Child menu-wise (which is another restaurant I didn't think I'd like until I ultimately tried it). There's a healthy mix of sandwiches/salads/wraps. They also do a thing where you can pick a protein (or tofu) and however many sides you want at $4 each. This is the option a went with (tofu + two sides).  As far as the restaurant itself it's nice. The dining room is big, and they have a bar (which I appreciate) as well as a nice patio. My one complaint is no matter where you sit it's LOUD.   My friend and I were confused when we walked in. We were waiting on someone else, but wanted to order a drink while we waited. At Farm & Craft you order food from a counter. The hostess told us if we were only drinking order from the bar, but if we were getting food...even if we were waiting to do so until our other friend arrived order at the counter. Don't really see the difference, but sure.   What made things even a little more confusing is that once our friend arrived (and the place got a little busier) a waitress came to our table as we were getting up to order at the counter (?).  That all being said, once you get past the whole confusing set-up/ordering process the food & drink are good!  For one, this place does Happy Hour (2-6). I forget what the beer is called they have on HH, but it's good and it's only $3. We also ordered the spinach dip, which was $5 during HH and it was delicious. It came w/carrots & healthy-ish crackers that were good.   Like I mentioned earlier I did the tofu + sides. The tofu was good, although I wish it would have been a little warmer. The bacon brussel sprouts were delicious and I LOVED the farro & cheese! It was rich, and cheesy and the farro was a very good substitute for pasta. The portions were not huge, but were definitely fair for the price.   I'd come back here during HH for sure."}
{"text":"The owner to get started: racist and absolutely insulting. We went into the bar/ restaurant to have a nice breakfast, when the bald man started insulting myself and my group. He made rude comments and tried to talk under his breathe. As well as racial slurs....He was trying to overprice items that were clearly stated on the menu, and was trying to kick out group out \"politely\". The service was horrid and the owner himself was hitting on younger women less than 2 times his age. Absolute creep. Will be referring to the friends I have that go there to find a new location for brunch. Will never be back and wouldn't recommend this place to ANYONE. Horrible service and ownership."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed this trendy hip resto. Amazing cocktails very good food and great music in a location perfect for people watching. Outside tables are great when the weather is cooperative. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I think I love the concept of Farm & Craft more than I actually like Farm & Craft.  It gives off such healthy, fresh, simple vibes that I really appreciate and our avocado lime hummus starter was great but I wish the Rustic Farm Salmon Bowl had been way more flavorful.  It needed a sauce and a lot more salt and pepper.  The salmon itself was wonderful but everything else just fell a bit flat.  I did really like my kombucha cocktail though!"}
{"text":"This place has one of the best bartenders she super nice and really cool. Amazing menus and great flavors! Definitely recommend any of the kombucha cocktails. Awesome happy hour!"}
{"text":"Happy hour here is one to try out, 2-6pm. $5 glasses of Rose, $8 kombucha cocktails, beer specials. A few $6 appetizer specials; I opted for the avocado hummus and the mushroom pizza. I would order both again; perhaps without the greens topping on the pizza. I would also ask for more veggies to be served with the hummus to keep it a bit healthier. Tip: the pizza crust dipped in the hummus is delicious!! Both portions could serve as a full meal for one on their own. If you're looking for a place to do work, this place rocks- lots of plug-ins in the tables across the back wall and free wifi."}
{"text":"Seems like healthy food, small for the cost, but its the main drag in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"such a cute hip restaurant! I love the healthy options and all the staff is very friendly... don't get me started on the coffee so good (:"}
{"text":"I love a cool and hip place. This is exactly what you get at Farm & Craft. When you walk in, you look to the right and can see an open kitchen with greenery.   The staff was super friendly and the menu was very accommodating to people with different diets than the usual meat eaters.   My only complaint is the portion size - but it may just be because people in AZ are healthy and like to hike. However, I didn't really get full off our meal.   For a recommendation, I definitely think the avocado hummus is worth a taste!"}
{"text":"Cute place. Service was not good and can improve. The food was great. High quality ingredients. Cool juices and mixed drinks."}
{"text":"I went to Farm and Craft for the first time this week and since I've already been back twice. They have a great spinach artichoke dip that is cheap during happy hour. I also loved the atmosphere and the service! I had the strawberry goat salad the first time with a glass of the Riesling which were both amazing. The cocktails were also to die for, if you like sweet cocktails I recommend the Kombucha & Nectarine! I also had the Kale Pesto with Chicken which I think is my favorites thing so far on the menu. I think I have found my new favorites healthy food place to go to. Basically go To Farm &Craft they will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and had the egg white and chicken sausage scramble. It had so much taste, yummy."}
{"text":"Nice patio outside and really friendly service. The food was ok. I ordered a burger and it was just crumbles of ground beef on a bun, not like an actual burger. A friend ordered macaroni and cheese - but it's actually farrow mixed with some cheese. So maybe that's just how the menu is - they should just make the menu titles more consistent with what the food actually is."}
{"text":"Things started out well. We were seated for lunch right away. Our adorable server was so sweet and helpful with deciding on our menu selections. We each ordered an entree, my girlfriend ordered a cocktail. He brought her her drink ( i was drinking water) That was the last time our server came to the table  When our food was ready, a different server brought the food. No one checked to see if the food was ok (it was ). Never got a fill on our water. We even sat for quite awhile with our plates empty until we finally asked a different server to get our waiter to get a check. That waiter forgot to grab our original server so we waited longer. Then we grabbed that server again and asked him for our check (we had been done eating for at least 20 min now). He apologized and told us that our server was training to be a manager so he was real busy (my friend had been watching him chatting about tattoos and socializing with the table behind us). If he in fact was training to be a manager he is going to be a horrible manager. Like I said he started out great, but the impression from our visit will prevent either of us from going back"}
{"text":"The kale and chicken flatbread was amazing. I didn't try it but the steak sandwich looked awesome and the Mac and cheese"}
{"text":"The staff was very unhelpful when we arrived after I said that we had never been there before. Our \"server\" also packed us a to go order after I said we would be dining there and made me fill up my own water cup at the station that is clearly only used by the staff. The food was good but I'm pretty sure it gave me some sort of food poisoning because it was the only abnormal thing I ate that day and ended up sick a few hours later so I will not be returning. Very expensive and loud anyway."}
{"text":"Omg everything here is sooo much goodness! The staff is awesome great experience every time"}
{"text":"Great healthy way to start your day!  In town for a long weekend vaca and looked up places on yelp of course and figured let's try it and great choice! Had the strawberry juice drink and the avocado toast!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and fresh juiced cocktails. I got the salmon toast dish. Was way good."}
{"text":"Fast casual style (walk up order and take your number).  Had a massive cold brew that tasted kind of unique. I think it was the nitro, would definitely recommend. The service was friendly and the scene was real cool. Indoor and outdoor setup with a bar. I had the burrito which was pretty good, not a game changer by any means. It had salmon in it which was cool. Wife got the aÃ§aÃ­ bowl and she was real happy with that. Overall, awesome scene/location pretty good food too."}
{"text":"Loved everything about it. Great service, beautiful space, amazingly creative and fresh food! I had the steak bowl with beets and Brussels sprouts. Delicious! Kombucha with bourbon - !"}
{"text":"Love the kambucha here ! This place absolutely one of my favorite brunch spots in scottsdale. The food is fresh  and delightful. He portions are consistent love the ambiance as well"}
{"text":"This place has good healthy food, OK drinks, and a nice atmosphere.  The only real con's are the noise, it's loud here for lunch, not so much for dinner, and the price... Little pricey for what you get, but this is Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and is a great place to go if you're looking for something healthy and relatively quick. I've gotten a few different things off the menu, but my two favorites were the spinach salad with strawberries and goat cheese and the flatbread with balsamic and artichokes and such.  They were both fantastic, both pretty light lunches, and both left me wanting to come back to get it again.  The outdoor seating is a great place to sit on a nice day and it's in a super convenient location right in old town Scottsdale.  Everything on the menu I am sure is amazing and if you have any questions about the menu or what to get, the staff has always been super helpful with recommendations of their favorites."}
{"text":"OMG this greyhound is amazing!  Outdoor healthy eating at its finest.  Parking is a little difficult"}
{"text":"Vibes were decent. Kombucha was great. However, I have been here several times and the food was below average. The only good thing I've had there is the humans."}
{"text":"I had the best breakfast sandwich from here.  It was so good.  I like to great here at least twice a month."}
{"text":"It's ok.  I went there to eat watch the game and go on somewhat of a new date.  It was so loud unfortunately but in the end fortunately because the date was awkward.  But the food was soso.  We started with some Artichoke and Spinach Dip and it was fine nothing great.  I had the Penne with the sausage.  It was like I could boil some pasta and dump some Ragu on it.  Small portion too.  I left hungry.  Big disappointment."}
{"text":"I came here with my parents as we were staying at the Hilton Garden Inn down the road.  I'm vegan and read reviews here on yelp telling me they had good vegan options. That wasn't exactly the case.  The menu didn't have many vegan options a all HOWEVER it was easy to change dishes to make them vegan so that was really a non-issue.  I had a latte with almond milk which was quite watery but other than that the food and service were really good.  It's a very clean and modern set up with both inside and outside seating.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  I would definitely recommend if you're looking for a yummy yet healthy breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, sincere server who was kind and helpful with the menu, live DJ, and the food was delicious. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday while apartment searching and even with a line in front of me, I was promptly seated. Trying to keep it light, I had the avocado toast and a side of bacon and was delighted with how fresh it all tasted. I had a kombucha (that they have on tap!) tequila and it was a perfectly refreshing break in the day.   I would have been happy if it ended here, but I even had the opportunity to talk to the GM and she was very knowledgeable and helpful. It was great to see someone who was so attentive to the customers while also helping her staff. This is going to become a frequent weekend lunch spot!   I would absolutely recommend a stop for anyone looking to relax and enjoy some delicious and healthy food."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with some friends. We were all here when it was the Herb Box. We liked that place but like this much more. The open, bright restaurant is warm and inviting. I had the build your own bowl with tofu, grilled veggies and gluten free penne mac & cheese. The veggies were great with just the right amount of char. The tofu was soft, I prefer firm. There was a green sauce on top of the tofu which wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked. I would ask for extra of that green sauce. We ALL enjoyed our meals which doesn't happen very often.   We were there for about an hour and a half. When it was time to go my husband mentioned that he was hungry. I was too but that it was just because of what I ordered. He had the rustic salmon bowl with quinoa and veggies. Even though the food was very good, the portions were not substantial.   Thank you for having gluten free, vegetarian and vegan options."}
{"text":"After almost a week of eating not always the healthiest food this place was a blessing.   We started out with a super refreshing kombucha cocktail and had veggie-meat-super yummy bowls. They were perfectly portioned and reasonably priced (esp for this area)."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places I've ever eaten at. Such healthy food for amazing prices. I eat here so much it's not even funny."}
{"text":"The food I found to be pretty bland, with nothing spectacular about it. Similar menu design to chop shop, which I find preferable. But the environment and ambiance  are really nice to enjoy a healthy  meal. Good happy hour wine specials."}
{"text":"Fresh local food.  Everything from bread, butter, appetizers, salads, and proteins are excellent.  Everything is simply made and they allow the ingredients to speak for themselves.  The ambiance is bright, and refreshing.  Perfect for brunch or lunch.  Service is top notch."}
{"text":"It's like all your perfectly-healthy friends who make you mindful of your own wellness, with lectures of gluten intolerance and inflammation and Mercury in retrograde teamed up and opened their own casual restaurant.   Farm & Craft, which specializes in neither farm-style comfort food nor craft cocktails is a bright, airy, health-conscious locale to have tons of fun, albeit with a little less guilt. On a Spring day, the way natural light pours in is energizing and positive. I absolutely love it!  The modest menu is comprised of mostly safe selections, but with twists designed to make them a bit higher quality (or at least healthier). For example, grass-fed beef, flax seed & whole wheat carbohydrates, and chicken/fish from small, reputable sources. I enjoyed my BBQ Chicken flatbread. With the addition of black beans, I am sure this was packed with fiber, which is cool. The chicken was unnoticeable, and what I did notice appeared to be *gasp* unseasoned, so if they ever want to just give up on that and pencil it in as a vegetarian item, it'll probably fare much better.   When it comes to the drink menu, kombucha cocktails absolutely steal the show. I don't find these to be particularly complex or awe-inspiring. If cocktails are an art, these are a gimmick. But they are refreshing gimmick you should try if for no other reason than to satisfy your curiosity. I went with the kombucha habanero, which was...kombucha and habanero vodka. I also tried the bourbon variety, which had plenty of banana flavor as well. If this isn't up your alley, you'll find a limited selection of other cocktails. Four are some decent looking fruity cocktails, and four are just comprised of basic liquors served in grapefruits or halved watermelons. These look amazing for presentation, which is why I ordered one, but the quantity of booze you're getting is minuscule.   Yes, I paid $11 to drink less than one shot of Tito's out of a grapefruit. I deserve to be made fun of.   Anyways, let's talk about the service. It's slow. Painfully slow. I felt like just one person had all the tables. Drinks took 15 minutes to arrive. Getting our checks at the end (for a party of about 10) was a 40-minute process. Lunch was 3 hours.   To conclude, Farm & Craft is vaguely health-conscious and very aesthetic, but that doesn't necessarily translate into taste or culinary creativity. If you're in the mood for guilt-free food, but you also want to booze it up, this place will work, even if it does feel like you're compromising a bit on both ends. I would personally prefer to go to one place for light bites and another for cocktails. I would also come back to grab some goodies to-go. It's OK."}
{"text":"Simple menu items but everything was very good. I got the salmon toast and my bf got the bfast sandwich. We both enjoyed our dish. My tip is to add avocados in the salmon toast bc it really helps balance the saltiness of the lox. This place also has excellent customer service. Everyone was so nice and gave love to our pup."}
{"text":"My experience here was marvelous. I love the design of the menu and how it's sorted into the four different categories.   Our server was great and very knowledgeable of the menu. That always makes the experience more pleasant. I will definitely be coming back here for some more yummy Kombucha cocktails as well"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! A trendy walk up restaurant with healthy food options. The place is so well done, the decor is on point, welcoming and open air. Big groups are welcome, the only reason for the missed star is the service. We ordered an iced coffee , food and a juice. The food came out on time however we had to remind the staff that we still had drinks coming, once they delivered the drinks, the latte was just a black coffee. We told the manager and she fixed the drink. I would def go back, and try it again."}
{"text":"First off let me say that the management here is spectacular, I am beyond impressed. My original experience at Farm and Craft left me disappointed and much to be desired; I expressed my frustration and immediately was contacted by Kevin who invited me back to show what F&C truly has to offer.   So yesterday I (skeptically) decided to give it another try and called in an order to go. I got the hummus appetizer, turkey wrap, and breakfast with sunny side up eggs, chicken sausage, and sweet potato hash. Laura took my order and was quick, competent, and delightful on the phone. I arrived about 10 minutes later and was warmly greeted with my order hot, smelling amazing, and ready to go. It was all packaged separately and each dish nicely displayed in containers.   Once home it was time to dig in and see if the food is actually any good. Well, the breakfast was spectacular, and the eggs were cooked to perfection, the turkey wrap was filled with fresh turkey, avocado, and healthy greens, and the hummus appetizer had lots of accoutrements accompanied by a creamy delicious hummus . The ingredients are clearly of good quality, and you can feel good about what you are putting in your body.   The atmosphere and seating at Farm and Craft is very fun and inviting. It's open and warm; a place that you can meet a friend for lunch or just chill by yourself and get some work done. The food is pricey, but they have good happy hour deals and the flatbreads on the menu look enticing!   I am so glad I had the opportunity to give this place another try and become a fan of not only the restaurant itself, but the management and customer service. Bravo Farm and Craft, Bravo"}
{"text":"Awesome location--this spot is situated in a really cute area. Parking is not an issue as there is a free garage a couple blocks down. The place itself has a really chill vibe. As for the food- I tried the strawberry aÃ§aÃ­ bowl, which was extremely refreshing especially since I had just gotten back from a hike. The only downfall would be the portion size. I finished it in three bites but that might've been because I was just hiking. Not too pricey but probs wouldn't purchase an aÃ§aÃ­ bowl here again due to size. From my experience, this place isn't tryna wow you with their customer service but we got our meals pretty quick so that's s plus."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Absolutely loved the service. Our waiter was great. The only thing I would say wasn't the best was the music. It was SO loud. I can understand why it'd be on and turned up for the atmosphere but seriously it was so loud we couldn't even hear our waiter. We asked to move outside and it was better but still really loud. All complaining aside, the kombucha cocktails are amazing!"}
{"text":"Was ordered this for pickup. I got the Cali Chicken Bowl which I loved. The chicken is very flavorful. He ordered the Tocoa Steak Bowl. I didn't like this one, the meat was way too bland. I will definitely be back for quick easy food."}
{"text":"Le Meh. We came here for a work lunch since we work in the neighborhood and left underwhelmed. Another classic example of style over substance. Nothing was bad but nothing was great. Cool style but the menu and the experience are borrowed from other places that execute them better (see Flower Child or Chop Shop). I'd come for the atmosphere but not with an appetite."}
{"text":"Farm and craft was the perfect place for my annual New year resolution, eating clean. Parking can be a little annoying but if your patient you might get a spot near by.   I just happen to make my first visit on Thursday night. Thursday they have flatbread and a bottle of wine for $20.  I would of loved to have ordered it if I didn't commit to not drinking while on trek to clean eating.  Walking in it was pretty busy with no open tables besides the bar or patio. Luckily they have heaters from top to bottom on the patio which is perfect for me.   Service was a little slow to start off and I could hear the waiter Tell the tables in front and behind me apologizing for the wait and that the kitchen was backed up. So I kinda gave the waiter some slack and maybe it was the $20 Thursday rush.   Right after he let the other tables know about the food he finally noticed our table. We ordered Kombutcha with Rum and Kombutcha with Bourbon. Definitely recommend the Kombutcha with Bourbon it was delicious!  For my main dish I ordered chicken Farro Mac & Cheese which was pretty good. But sadly my chicken was so dry it was tough to chew and I couldn't even cut threw it.  I feared sending it back to the kitchen having to wait another 30 mins.  One dish I really enjoyed and could eat over and over again was the avocado hummus! It was the appetizer and I should of just ordered that for dinner that would of satisfied my palette.   For dessert I ordered the Paleo brownies with a scoop of ice cream. It was the perfect ending to dinner, but beware it's not your usual brownie! So if your in for a sweet treat this may not be your choice, but I loved it.   Maybe next time service will be better and my chicken will not be so dry."}
{"text":"So disappointed! The last time I was here, the food was great! This time was so subpar I wasn't sure if I  was at the same restaurant.  The Veges were so overdone and the quinoa was so so so salty. The almond coconut coffee was over sweet.  Would not come back."}
{"text":"Went with a group of four for the flatbread a bottle deal but had dinner also. The farm flatbread was good. When I ordered the north by northwest red wine it was served cold. The waiter was super nice but the service just took longer than you would think. Both my friend and I had the burger and it was average/good, but our guys got Greek salad and tacos and neither one was impressed. This place is really for the people that enjoy \"healthy\" fare and trendy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is great. Cocktails are phenomenal. But don't order the steak sandwich. Each half of the sandwich had on tiny cube of steak and when we asked if that was correct, we were told \"yes. It's portioned in to 4 oz\". I find it hard to believe that that was 4 oz.   Other than that, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fantastically creative, yet simple menu with a very laid back, cool vibe (a tad hipster, but not in a cringeworthy way). Everything they brought to the table was so well crafted and presented, very tasty too. Big thumbs up for this joint."}
{"text":"I have been here twice since the restaurant opened and was excited to check out a new healthy concept in Old Town.  My first impression when I walked in - wow this really reminds me of Flower Child and True Food.  The Farm to table concept isn't new.  And it seems that Riot Hospitality Group (El Hefe/Whiskey Row) has caught on to the trend of healthy and fresh and is trying to capitalize on it.  Honestly wasn't much new or original about this place that impressed me.  I think what Sam Fox or Chop House has developed is excellent - they know their audience and they cater to it.  There is something about this place that is amiss...  The first time I walked in for lunch solo, I was greeted warmly and the hostess explained the menu and restaurant concept quite well.  I beat the lunch rush so the restaurant wasn't overly crowded.  I ordered the Rustic Farm bowl and an iced tea and sat at the high top long table.  When I received my lunch and noticed I would have to cut the large vegetables myself, I was surprised that all they offered for lunch were cheap plastic knives and forks.  It would be nice if they offered real silverware to make it easier to cut the hard bokchoy!  Iced tea options are great - even the ice was same as flower child. The second time I came I stopped by for lunch with my best friend.  It was packed and we sat outside.  I ordered the farro mac and cheese.  Again, it seemed like a knock off of the mac & cheese at flower child with a different pasta. I think this place has potential to be great if they figure out they come up with something slightly original and get to know their audience and cater to it, rather than trying to be trendy and gimmickry.  We shall see!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was good, but overpriced. The friends that were with me waited extremely long for their order only to find out that it had been lost. There was no apology, no offer to make it right, just a bit more waiting for the food."}
{"text":"I love this place. Awesome food, great service, great vibe. Had no issue with music level at the times I was there which have always been mornings; I can't speak to the other times of day. As to portion size, if you're looking for the kind of large portions that flop over your plate, this is really not the place for you. If you're looking for an appropriate, healthy portion you should have no issues."}
{"text":"Farm + Craft is a great go-to for a reasonably priced, healthy meal. The food was excellent, and the atmosphere with the open glass windows was pleasant and inviting. We ordered a build-your-own bowl with roasted brussel sprouts and sweet potato hash, the tocoa bowl, and the wild mushroom flatbread. The items were all good, but the brussel sprouts were the highlight. The service was fast, and it was a perfect quick and tasty meal."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere and friendly staff has us ordering off the menu almost immediately. We were so excited to try a new place that seemed healthy! We ordered quickly and sat down to wait for our food. The food came and the presentation was amazing. To my surprise the portions were very small and the food was just above average. What we had was not worth 40.00 for lunch."}
{"text":"I gotta give it to this place, it makes me feel like I'm at home (California). If you've ever been to San Diego or Santa Monica, this place gives off those strong vibes. I've been here twice so far, the first time we tried this place on a whim when we went to Scottsdale for the first time. It looked a little intimidating at first since I thought it was a wine bar but I wanted to try new things so I convinced our group to stop there. I'm so glad I did cause it was very chill and not intimidating at all. We were seated outside and just felt peaceful and happy with the music playing in the back. I love a place with loud music but not loud enough that you can't talk. I felt that it had the perfect volume to immerse you in the happy songs!   It was happy hour so we ordered the avocado hummus and a few drinks. The drinks were absolutely delicious and not too light either. I NEED to go back and try all of them! The hummus came out and we were blown away. We are hummus fanatics and this was perfect for us! Not too thin or thick served with pita and an array of vegetables. We actually ended up ordering another plate of it because it was so good (we were only there for a stop-by on our tour of Scottsdale food),   The second time we went we again had amazing food altho the service was a bit slow. The wait staff was super nice and apologetic that it really made up for it! I will definitely be back to sample more of the menu!"}
{"text":"First time here and i was impressed with everything from the food to the service to the atmosphere. I had the chicken salad, salad. My husband had the steak sandwich and we shared the faro and cheese just to try it. The food was presented beautifully and tasted great. Our server Kris was awesome. He made some great recommendations and was super personable. I'm excited to have a new go to spot for healthy eating here in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome menu. The only thing I would suggest is serving jam with the toast. According to the waiter hey don't serve it which is surprising."}
{"text":"1. There are two entrances, one of which does not have anyone there to point you to the right direction.  2. One of the waitresses cut off another while they were walking away with dishes and the other rolled her eyes and called her a 'f***ing b***h'. Pretty unsettling for brunch time. 3. There seemed to be a disconnect between the hostess and the waiter/waitress team as about 1/3 of the seating were open, but there was at least 10 of us still waiting to be seated. I know sometimes restaurants do this to look like they're a hot spot that's busy, but this wasn't working. 4. Our waiter was nice and knew his stuff, but seemed to be out of it as well as he missed a few details in my order like not bringing any cream with my coffee.   Overall I think this place has a lot of potential, beautiful design, great healthy food, but needs to be better managed to clean up the edges."}
{"text":"Foods good. The atmosphere is fun. The bugs/flying nats, not so much fun. Makes me wonder why they are here and why so many. Too bad. Cute place."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  LOVE the design, the menu and over all vibe!  Great spot! From the Avo Toast to Acai Bowl - to the best Pancakes ever!  Only been for breakfast and lunch - and YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Delicious cocktails and the protein pancakes are so good. Regular Bloody Mary highly recommend and the cure cocktail. Chicken sausage side is so good too. I feel like it does take a while to get drinks though, but service is friendly and helpful :)"}
{"text":"3.5 to be exact. Came here for dinner tonight...unfortunately, it took 15 minutes for a server to acknowledge us. We had to ask for a server. Luckily we had good company to chat with so it didn't feel all that long....our server was apologetic and told us there was a mix up.  We ordered the vegan ceviche and the vegan pizza. The ceviche was very delicious. The combinations of veggies that went into it were very unique. The pizza was quite good. I don't typically like arugula, but it worked well on top of the pizza. The cheese was well melted, definitely one of my favorite vegan pizzas that I've had. It can get pricy pretty darn fast for a vegan meal.   There's a fair amount of vegetarian options, I wouldn't say a lot of vegan options. The space is airy and very cute."}
{"text":"The service was amazing and it overall had a solid atmosphere. Would easily go back. To be fair, I didn't have any food, just wine. Still, was fun to check out..."}
{"text":"Great place to start the day. Healthy options full of flavor. Try the egg white,avocado protein toast. Staff is friendly and fun."}
{"text":"I like this place. But I can't say that I love it. I think it's a bit pricey for what you get. But it is very popular and at times it's hard to get in."}
{"text":"The ambiance was great and so were the employees. However, I paid $50.00 for two people (I was told the proportions were big) and left hungry. I loved that they sell bulletproof bars. Yet again, another new \"trendy\" restaurant that focuses more on ambiance than food. I feel as if I'm paying for the trendy atmosphere than the actual food. Their breakfast looks amazing but the price for some avocado toast is beyond me. Probably won't go back because let's be honest, I would rather spend that money on a nice dinner rather than an average meal."}
{"text":"Highly recommend for breakfast.  Was in town for a few days and dined here twice.  Enjoyed the egg white, chicken apple sausage scramble with whole wheat toast and the coconut, almond milk cold brew coffee.  Cute atmosphere.  Didn't try, but their smoothies and fresh juices looked delish."}
{"text":"We stopped here after getting off the airport in Phoenix to grab a quick bite to eat before driving to Sedona. I loved the set up of the place with the quick walk up ordering and sitting anywhere you want! The restaurant itself was really cute with bright walls that really lit up the room when the sun is out.   I docked it one star because I think it is crazy overpriced for the food you get. I paid a little over $20 for a lunch for myself that didn't include a drink or sides. It was delicious but a little bit oily."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to stumble upon Farm & Craft after arriving in Scottsdale. One look at the menu and I knew there would be plenty of options to accommodate my Whole30 diet. I ordered the salmon dish with sides of sweet potatoes and garlic spinach. I loved the varied unsweetened iced tea options and helped myself to one of the unique flavors before parking myself at a table next to an outlet to charge my phone.   Food is cooked to order so there was a short wait time, but totally worth it! My dish was incredible and probably my favorite thing I ate in Scottsdale all week. My only regret is that I didn't have an opportunity to return. Great spot for healthy people who love food."}
{"text":"We came to check out the new restaurant on the block. It has lots of healthy options. The drinks are unique and tasty. So far we had Kombucha & Haberno,  Firestone 805 and skewers. All were good. Looking forward to trying other items."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a hike on Camelback Mountain, so we obviously had to order breakfast burritos AND a side of sweet potato hash. Perfection! The grapefruit Paloma is also a must have."}
{"text":"Bartender was awesome and very helpful about area. Good looked fantastic and cocktails were right on the money!! Great spot!"}
{"text":"Food was phenomenal but the worst service i've ever had. Server was on their phone, didn't ask for order, didn't do a 2-bite 2-minute, didn't refill water. it's like i didn't even have a server. manager had to being the food and some busser brought the check. Recommend the food but not worth it to leave angry."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend while in town for work. I love that they have a smaller menu because what they do make is excellent. This is a great restaurant for healthy minded people who enjoy good food and enjoy having organic and locally sourced food. There cocktails are unique and outstanding. I had a cucumber kombucha. Very refreshing. I love the indoor and outdoor seating options too"}

{"text":"Was visiting Scottsdale for a girls' weekend and adored this place! We came in around 9am on a Sunday. Place was quite empty, but picked up shortly thereafter. Service was quick in the beginning, but started slowing down within 30- minutes due to all the people coming in. It did take a while to get our check which was a little annoying. The food was phenomenal though! Our table shared the pancakes, which had a wonderful texture (a little more dense than fluffy) and was perfect! Two of the girls got the protein toast, another got a sausage scramble and I made a protein bowl. Food was healthy, but didn't taste bland like some healthy places seem to do. Would definitely visit here again if I come back to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Visited on a whim without reviewing Yelp!  Atmosphere - Top Notch! The restaurant appears very clean and decorated very nicely. It's a very trendy environment. As you enter, you're greeted by the host(es) and a huge menu on the wall. The dining area is set up well and would provide well for 20-30 people. They also have a bar which I would probably visit on a Friday or Saturday night.  Food - Ehh! This where things go south. I wanted a mid-morning breakfast burrito and found this place. They don't offer the average breakfast burrito but instead a very trendy version. Burrito = No, Wrap = Yes. I appreciate the gluten free tortilla, corn salsa and chicken sausage and, so much more. They were out of corn salsa and offered pico (which was pretty good) as an alternative. I also ordered coke but they only carried \"pure cane sugar\" cola, which tastes no different. The burrito cost about $16 and the cola was about $2. Expensive but, I'm open minded.   My experience - My \"wrap\", sliced in half, was delivered to my table after about 5 min. About half way through the wrap, I noticed a beard hair lying on my plate. I don't have a beard, however, the cook did. The staff, including the cook, host and bartender were socializing at the bar when I took the plate with beard hair to them. The cook immediately said that what I encountered was corn hair not beard hair. Just happened to be the same color and approx length of his beard (interesting). More interesting was that I had pico in my \"wrap\" not corn salsa because, remember...they were out of corn salsa.  Conclusion - Nice atmosphere, great decor, sub-par food, sub-par service all at an expensive rate. Basically, you  pay top dollar for a fancy restaurant and not-so-fancy food that you could cook better yourself, minus beard hair. Needless to say, I will surely never return, even if it were free."}
{"text":"This was a nice start to the morning. I personally just got eggs and bacon, which were tasty. And they actually know how to make an over medium egg, so there's that. My co-worker got some sort of egg white and sweet potato scramble. Looked good but a little to \"hip\" for me. Would I go back? Sure. Service was spot on."}
{"text":"I've been her twice so far. The ambiance is good... the food is meh. Location is great, dÃ©cor is on point. But - I'm really looking forward to loving the food a bit more. Hopefully they retool the menu a bit and come up with a  bit more flavorful offerings."}
{"text":"In the past my boyfriend and I have just absolutely loved this place, we would go every week,but recently things have taken a turn. I am not sure if there is new management or what but we both have noticed some things that have turned us away from going. When you walk in, you are not acknowledged. The hostess who is supposed to check you in always has their back to you which can sometimes feel awkward. The food consistency has also changed. Our meals have been without salad dressing or some meals fail to have all the ingredients stated on the menu. We were regulars so we are pretty familiar with what is supposed to come with and on our meals. Also, the service is so slow and the staff seem to want nothing to do with you. We spend time waiting for silverware or looking for someone to help us pay the bill. I am a bit taken back by the lack of hospitality we have noticed recently. Anyways the food is pretty great and we really enjoyed it before this all happened."}
{"text":"Great food with fun atmosphere. Black bean and spinach with egg.  Bloody' dare awesome."}
{"text":"Outstanding meal (rustic salmon bowl, burger, and  chicken Mac and Cheese) and wonderful service. We loved being able to eat on the patio with our dog. They have strong heaters to cut the winter chill and upbeat music. Cool open, modern space. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"good food, but even better service.  Very well managed.  Through an extremely busy lunch hour, they were very organized and efficient in dealing with the rush.  They even took some extra time to fill up a doggie bowl with water.  Good ingredients, great menu, great service.  Really enjoyed my experience."}
{"text":"It was so disappointing I made a Yelp account to write this review. My friends and I arrived at 9:00 am on a Sunday, were seated around 9:18 (reasonable given it's a Sunday). We ordered brunch around 9:30 and were not served the food till 10:20. Essentially we watched people that were seated after us finish their meals, pay their tabs, and leave before we were served. When were were served, the eggs were burnt, the bacon was ultra fatty (only 10% was edible, the rest was yellow fat), and the toast was so stale.  The waiter was super apologetic, stating that it was unacceptable (with regard to the wait time for being served). A $5 discount and a free coffee were applied to the total check (lol). I want to love this place, the decor is very cute and it's in a great location;however based on service (specifically the kitchen) and quality of food, I'd recommend against dining here."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Farm & Craft on Saturday 2/24/18. The place was busy (it was brunch time), and we had to wait about a half hour for a table; they have a text system that alerts you when your table is ready which was very nice because it allowed us to walk around and look in the stores in the surrounding area. I got a hipster-ish yet casual vibe from this place. There were tables outside and a comfortable amount of space between tables inside the restaurant.   Once we were seated, we were waited on by a very friendly and enthusiastic staff. The menu had plenty of options, all of which were highlighted by various health-oriented aspects. The options were extensive enough to provided unique dishes without being repetitive but not so widespread that it was overwhelming.   They had a wide range of beverages and cocktails that included house juiced concoctions, kombucha on tap, a typical range of bistro coffees, and an exceptional list of cocktails. I had originally intended to get kombucha, but my attention was diverted by a drink with my namesake (the Patrick); so, I tried that instead. The Patrick was a blend of pineapple juice, cantaloupe juice, lime juice, and jalapenos. Despite the jalapenos, the drink was not spicy, but the flavor was prevalent and nicely balanced the sweetness of the other juices.  For my entre, I order the salmon toast which was assembled with smoked salmon, tzatziki, watercress, and cherry tomato on top of flax whole wheat toast that I would guess was made in house; it was delicious and appropriately portioned so as not to fill me up but left me satisfied. All the flavors melded well; between the smokiness of the salmon and the subtle creamy, cool, tanginess of the tzatziki was applied in the perfect amount not to overpower the other flavors, the sweet cherry tomatoes had a wonderfully light taste to them that is often absent in supermarket tomatoes, and the flax seed toast added a wonderful grainy and savory flavor bringing the entire dish together. I also ordered their sweet potato hash which wasn't anything special, it consisted of diced sweet potatoes and caramelized onions, but still good.  My total bill was $14 not including tip, which I believe was a good value and reasonably priced for an ethically produced healthy meal. I would recommend going here."}
{"text":"Really amazing food, drinks, and atmosphere. Just a little warm for Scottsdale in June. We had a reservation for our friend's bachelorette party brunch and we were sitting in the direct sun. Just a simple sun shade would have been so helpful, just for future reference!!"}
{"text":"The great service and delicious and healthy food have kept me coming back.  love the cocktails too! Love everything about this place... from the kombucha on tap, to the fun decor. Def check this place out :)"}
{"text":"Love the healthy food options here! Wish this could open in Atlanta.  The ambiance is trendy chic, but be careful...because of this, the staff wears too short and small of clothes.  My friends and I couldn't believe the host was wearing a romper 2 sizes too small for her and her whoo haa could be seen.  But it was affordable, comfortable, trendy, and healthy.  The menu is difficult to read and too busy/all over the place, and I wish you could order at a table as I felt rushed to order up front.  Otherwise, great place and yummy healthy food!  Try the avocado lime hummus!!"}
{"text":"Food was ok and service was terrible. We ordered the protein pancakes which were extremely dry and it took 15 min to get more syrup. I also ordered the breakfast sandwich which was just mediocre. It was very dry as well . Also, I finished my meal before another drink was even offered to me. I will not be coming back here. There's a reason it is not busy."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at farm and craft is modern country. Great location in old town Scottsdale.   The drink menu is outstanding and very trendy, it includes kombucha mixed with alcohol and other slightly healthy sounding mixed alcoholic drinks. They have a great Rose deal too on the weekends.  If you're NOT up for drinking, their food is great too. My favorite breakfast here is the sausage and sweet potato hash with jasmine blackberry tea to drink.  For lunch or dinner I recommend the option to make your own. I love the sustainable salmon, carrots, ferro mac and cheese, and broccolini.   Service here for the most part has been good, though it seems like the last time I came here the service wasn't as good, which is why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5. One waitress did not know what our appetizer was called and so we had some confusion on what dish was ours. We also experienced not having our water refilled throughout our meal. Not a huge deal, but still inconvenient when you're thirsty.   I'll still be back though, healthy food options are always great, and I really likely the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really great food and beer on tap.  Loved the Prescott Amber.  Best beer I've ever had!  Service excellent as well.  Much better than the restaurant next door."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and well thought out. Very healthy breakfast. We plan to return for lunch as the lunch menu looks great too. The fresh pressed juices are a must! Although, the service is a tad slow for how slow the restaurant was this morning."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a late breakfast, the food was great. I had the protein toast, which hit the spot and my husband had the chicken bowl. He said it was a little bland but added their Sriracha which made it better. Over all The ambience was good, would recommend this place for brunch."}
{"text":"Been a couple of times now.   If you're a douchey, semi-pretentious bro-dawg who enjoys yelling over loud music with friends then this is your place.  In all seriousness... the restaurant is beautiful, their mimosas are some of the best but the rest is just \"eh\" - when mentioning how loud the music was they said \"ya we get complaints about that, but it's the vibe we're going for.\" Ummm... ok, then.  The food is fine, nothing too exciting."}
{"text":"Another placeholder so my pictures link. I'll update with details later, but the 4 star rating holds true."}
{"text":"We enjoyed ourselves and the food was above average but definitely priced higher than I prefer for that type of restaurant.  The wine happy hour special made up for it though!  :) The atmosphere was nice, service was decent."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch. It was okay, I had the spinach and black bean bowl which was kind of disappointing for how much I paid for it because I was still hungry after. Might come back here for lunch or dinner to try something different. The restaurant is very cute on the inside and I loved all the windows and the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Busy Sunday morning, but I made a reservation so seating was not a problem. Server was Joe, super awesome guy, great service and the food was amazing. Atmosphere is fun and hip. Great music. Great spot to people watch. Thanks for a nice Sunday brunch inAZ!"}
{"text":"pretty fashionable hipster spot. Very pricey for small portions, but good location. Way to spruce up the standards in old town"}
{"text":"This place is the best.  Ask for the secret menu btw.  This is now my go to spot for healthy and affordable food.  I might stop going to the gym because of how healthy the food is here.  Also the bathrooms here are really nice too - the toilet paper was for sure a two-ply."}
{"text":"This place is great! Awesome design, vibe and food. Good beer and cocktails also. No idea why it's not rated higher. I am from LA and this has such a chill SoCal vibe!"}
{"text":"Have been here a total of 3 times. Food is great however, every visit we have had lipstick on our glasses which was not mine. I am going to start asking for my drinks in a to-go cup. They did comp the beverages but come on, check your glasses before serving."}
{"text":"Very friendly weight staff.    Fun cocktails - get any of the Kambucha Cocktails and you won't regret it!    Fresh ingredients and good food. - I recommend the Spinach and Artichoke dish.    Hip vibe with great music indoors. (Could be a bit loud if you're trying to have a serious conversation)   I'd go back in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"In a little trendy spot in old town Scottsdale foods healthy but not great service is just OK and the prices are too high for what you get servers are too busy paying attention to each other and the manager forget it. It's great if you don't have a pallet"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and food here! I got the pancakes and they were amazing!!! I highly recommend coming here, especially for brunch because their fresh pressed cocktails are delicious.   The entire menu is very innovative and healthy, super refreshing, and surprisingly affordable for how yummy everything is!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for the first time for some dessert and espresso/cocktails.  The espresso had pieces of grounds in it and the bartender didn't have a clue as to what was behind her bar.  Service was great, but overall experience and atmosphere wasn't the best.  Maybe we'll check it out later this year if it's still open, we were bummed because we love and frequent so many restaurants in the midtown Phoenix and old town Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"What can I say come here to meet your future wife, because if shes here she has style. Great food, great service and the Peanut Butter & Milk Chocolate Stout is so good. If you get to know the bartenders the food comes out quicker :)"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch for the first time and I was pleasantly impressed!! I started off with the Forbidden fruit cocktail and I picked the spicy melon which is habanero vodka mixed inside a small watermelon . I love that fresh watermelon was mixed with vodka. Absolutely delicious!! Then I ordered the breaky burrito which has turkey, scrambled eggs, bacon, cheddar cheese and I added avocado. I loved it!!! And their green hot sauce was to die for!! I would definitely come here again for the fresh, healthy and delicious meals and drinks!!"}
{"text":"First time here, we decided to come here because a place down the street was too pack to even try and park. I am glad we found this place it was a nice ambiance the food was delicious and fresh. So if you are wanting to eat healthy I really recommend this place. Plus the staff is friendly. It was two of us eating and our total was around $40. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Glass smelled like rotten chicken, but the food was good. Had Checken and salmon with avacodo. It was good"}
{"text":"Gotta say the farm is on point but the craft is lacking! We grabbed a spot at the bar expecting to enjoy some good HH deals and craft cocktails. Unfortunately, cocktails seem to cater only to the frou frou Scottsdale crowd. Wound up ordering the weakest $11 Tito's and tonic in old town. Food was on par for the price. Did enjoy the Greek salad and steak bowl. Great place for food, but wouldn't waste my time if hoping for a good happy hour deals or cocktails.   Overall, hefty tab for underwhelming drinks and food we could whip up ourselves."}
{"text":"We came for lunch, the food may be good but the music is LOUD AND INTRUSIVE. Soft Jazz would be nice but this was rap. Even on the patio it was way to loud.  To the management this is my first and last visit unless you do something about the music. I hate rap and mist of what you broadcast seems to be that genre.   Over and out."}
{"text":"Farm craft is A very tasty healthy breakfast spot. I walked in and encountered some people from michigan and they greeted me as I walked in the door. They noticed I was wearing A lions shirt and hat and commented that they were from michigan as well. Then we were taken to our seats and given the menu of deliciousness. I tried the yogurt parfait A fresh pressed juice and for A big guy like me I ordered the breakfast burrito with avocado. The pressed juice made me feel great! The burrito was too delicious And had not a drop of grease! To me that is very impressive. The parfait was like no other left there eating some clean food that tasted bomb!"}
{"text":"This may have been a good restaurant if we had opportunity to get past rudeness upon entering. Yelp/Google stated they opened at 7am, we arrived at 7:45 and was told they wouldn't be open for another hour. Explained to employee that the Internet stated 7am but he didn't seem to care.  A simple \"sorry for the miscommunication\" or \"thanks for letting me know\" would have made our experience better and want to come back but now I'll pass."}
{"text":"This place is brand new and super cool! Fun environment and delicious food. Can't go wrong with a single menu item! If you're coming for brunch, make sure you're early because it gets packed."}
{"text":"The service is so astonishing bad. And then the food comes out and it's equally as disappointing. To not even have your water refilled on a boiling hot day is not a good sign and it's absolutely clear the staff had no interest in ensuring we had a good experience. We saw another table get up and leave because they had waited so long to be helped and I wish we had done the same."}
{"text":"Farm & Craft was an excellent choice for a night of solo dining on my recent business trip. Cool ambience, with an indoor tree as a centerpiece, and open concept! The bartender was super friendly and personable. Food was excellent! It was great to have some healthy, clean food after a week of eating junk! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you have hours to kill, this may be your spot.  The cocktails were delicious, but the service was so slow, it would be impossible to fail a field sobriety test.  They ran out of many ingredients for their signature cocktails. The food was only okay, but damn, that service was slow and inattentive."}
{"text":"A really nice option for a healthy meal in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. The menu is not extensive, yet full of yummy options. I like the fact that they divide their courses in four categories: antioxidants, probiotics, stress-relieving and anti-inflammatory. Even the flat breads are divine yet fresh, with lots of veggies. We got the sweet potato and artichoke one with balsamic drizzle on it...it went beyond all my expectations. Wine is good too. Be aware happy hour ends at 6 pm though. We'll come back, can't wait to try other flat breads!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Finally something that understands how foods affect the body and also make amazing dishes. A great variety of drinks, salads and entrees and you know it will all be high quality foods. Atmosphere is very trendy as well"}
{"text":"Love the drinks! A touch of healthy and a splash of sin. The menu has so many options that can fit with everyone's diet needs."}
{"text":"We came here for late night happy hour on Friday. We had the wild mushroom flatbread which was very good. Unfortunately the kitchen was closed for any other things that we wanted to try. We had the Underwood Pinot Noir wine which was nice. I tried the Firestone 805 draft beer which was very good. Service was very excellent. Our server, Ethan, was very attentive and knowledgeable. If we ever come back to Scottsdale will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Found this little gem on Yelp and glad we tried it! The menu seems a tad confusing at 1st but the lady at the front quickly explained it to us and it became very clear. You order the style or items you want and add the protein or you're welcome to make up your own. Salads all looked great but we decided on the Cali with which had edamame, quiona, kale, cheese and we added chicken. Delicious! We thought the portion seemed small but it was plenty! We got the flatbread with artichokes, chicken, carmelized onions, fig balsamic and kale pesto. Absolutely delicious. The staff was all very nice. I'd definitely go back and try some other stuff. Lastly, when I went to refill my tea, it was in a different spot next to one of servers cutting lemons with NO gloves. Ew. I'm glad I didn't have lemon in my tea because I would've definitely said something."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have great specialty drinks and the food is excellent! Ambience is great and the location couldn't be better! Great date night spot or a place to meet friends for drinks and food. Great vibes :)"}
{"text":"I really love this place!  I come here for brunch and evening cocktails!!  They have an amazing juice bar and healthier options for breakfast, which I love. They also have really creative cocktails. I have yet to be disappointed by any of them!  Cocktails with kombucha-say whaaaat?  YUM!!  The restaurant is not very big but I've never had to wait. They have a few tables of outdoor seating and heat lamps when appropriate. The staff has always been friendly!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here every Sunday after church for brunch. We usually get the protein pancakes and the American breakfast. We LOVE the sweet potato hash! Sitting outside feels like a vacation for us. Staff is always friendly and I can't believe how management is able to efficiently and thoroughly take care of these huge weekend crowds! We will continue to be regulars at the Scottsdale location and can't wait to try the new one in Phoenix.   The new crustless quiche on the menu is awesome. Try it!"}
{"text":"Do you like to be ignored and pretentiousness? This is definitely the place for you. Waited 5-10 minutes to be seated outside even though we could see multiple empty tables (the \"Reserved\" next to us was open before and after we left). We were finally seated and no one even acknowledged our existence for at least 10 minutes after which we left. No one could even recognize we were there. No water, no menus, no acknowledgement. Some of their menu items    \"reduce stress\". Seriously? Want to reduce a customer's stress? Pay attention to them! The place was not even that crowded on a Friday night...not surprising."}
{"text":"Decided to give Farm and Craft another try. Much, much better the second time around. Still flatbreads a little off/different, maybe this just isn't the place to get them.. but everything else was great!"}
{"text":"Everything tastes super fresh and is definitely healthier than similar concepts.  However, i wasn't very impressed with the sausage & sweet potato hash, definitely lacking flavor/seasoning.  Love the Humus & pita plate.  The protein pancakes were delish! Portions are a bit on the smaller side if going for brunch."}
{"text":"We arrived at the restaurant around 6:30pm. The servers was very slow. Took some time for our server to bring 2 ice waters and take our dinner order. They brought the appetizer nachos and the entire lasagna and soba noddles at the same time. The lasagna was over cooked. The noddles were bunt on the bottom. This did did not have any flavor. The soba noddles were very salty. This was not a very good dinner."}
{"text":"Interesting food. Healthy options but not your typical breakfast food menu. The protein pancakes were awesome!"}
{"text":"Walked in for a late lunch on a warm day. The atmosphere and building are very appealing. All the windows were open. I went to the counter to order food and was greeted by the friendly cashier. She was helpful in my drink selections and had me sample a few item. I chose their brewed teas and they were amazing. I sat at the table and waited for my food. It took a while to get my food given that there weren't too many people in the building. I ordered the salmon and two asides. When I got my food I noticed the salmon was very grilled. When I started to eat it, it was over cooked and dry. I also had the mac and upon tasting it, you could taste the cheese was over cooked and had a burned taste. The best part was the broccoli with chili and cheese topping, it was perfectly cooked. I was disappointed in the quality for the 25 dollar lunch I had. The workers also did not smile or greet anyone."}
{"text":"I have been driving by Farm and Craft and wanting to try it for awhile. Lots of nearby street parking in this busy area.  Not much space for waiting to be seated though. Fortunately we were seated right away (11am on a Sunday) but many people milled around while they were waiting for a table. Emily was our server and she was on it- and busy. This is one of the places that it would be nice if they would just put a water carafe on the table. Their check-in yelp offer is avocado hummus which is very generous- about a $11 value.  It was scrumptious and I would have loved it even if it wasn't free. We had lavender lemonade and a kale juice- both very refreshing.  Our lunches were all delicious. They promote themselves as having fresh healthy food and it was.  It is a very loud restaurant and there is limited indoor seating so if you don't like loud music you may want to choose another place or sit outside."}
{"text":"Waited almost 25 minutes for server to come back to the table to take our order.  Plus a 15 minute wait for a table outside in the heat - no misters.  Food was tasteless, service terrible - will not return."}
{"text":"I had the make your own, steak, Mac and cheese, and bacon Brussels sprouts... All 3 were great! The lady that took my order was super friendly and nice, and food came out prompt. The atmosphere is adorable, love it!!"}
{"text":"Was there for dinner before 8pm, yesterday, Friday 18. We were greeted at hostess stand and seated promptly.  However, we apparently disappeared after that.  A good 5 minutes went by without even an acknowledgement \"we'll be right with you\".  We stood up and walked. I expressed my complaint to the hostess.  \"oh, where were you seated?\" As if that mattered.   \"Oh, no, that's terrible\".  No initiative to try correcting the opportunity.   Were they busy? No.  Tables were empty.  Wait staff and bussers around us.   We were right by the soda fountain.  Service is everything.  You failed."}
{"text":"Cute, trendy, fresh space with delicious healthy food and fabulous cocktails. The salmon harvest bowl is incredible, and incredibly filling. Also has outdoor seating and food available for sale for your pup. Trendy but to be expected. Perfect for a casual lunch."}
{"text":"I wanted to like it, however as a vegan my options are too limited to warrant spending my money there."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch on a Friday. At this time of day it is fast casual so you order at the counter then sit down. The food still takes a while to come out though so I'm not sure why this format exists. Also, it felt a little pricey for \"fast casual\", we had 3 meals and one iced tea and it was $47. The pesto flat bread was really good, my mom and sister both got bowls and they were really bland and flavorless. I gave it 3 Stars because I think it's the type of place where you have to know what's good to order, and I'm willing to try it again for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"We came to Farm & Craft twice during a 4 day trip, we enjoyed it so much.  The atmosphere is so fun and hip.  Food choices were fresh, healthy and delicious."}
