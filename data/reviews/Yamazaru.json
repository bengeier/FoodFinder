{"text":"Wife and I spend a few hours at Yamazaru and ordered some sushi and appetisers it was awesome it was a lot better than a sushi spot in Long Island N.Y. The service and price  was excellent,We will be going to Yamazaru more often.Try it you'll love it,I Did."}
{"text":"Yamazaru is one of the rare Charlotte restaurants that is still packed at 9:30 or 10 at night, often with people waiting at the door to get in.  Perhaps this is because it is one of the more reasonably priced Japanese restaurants in town, or within an easy walk of all the South End apartments and in the trendy former industrial area just west of the Lynx tracks and south of Tremont. The food here is not fantastic, but it is very good.  It's fairly consistent and the flavors are pretty authentic.  A bar runs down the right side of the restaurant with two TVs, one for the Japanese NHK station and one for sports or whatever.  The sushi bar is on the back left side of the restaurant.  Booths run down the center and tables surround.  There's also limited patio seating for tête-à-tête dining.  One drawback to Yamazaru is that the sushi chefs (and I believe there were 3 or 4) cannot keep up with the sushi orders.  If you arrive early in the evening, you're ok.  But if you arrive after 8pm, the sushi orders get bogged down.  If you order sushi and your companions order other food, they'll be long done with theirs before you get your sushi.  They can't really add any more chefs to that small sushi prep area.  So just plan on staying a while and being hungry as you watch your friends eat!  The other downer is that they offer many interesting sakes, but the prices are pretty stiff.  I would love to order a nice chilled Junmai Ginjo, but a 3 oz serving is $15 and I'd want more than 3 oz!"}
{"text":"We checked out Yelp and the reviews were good.  Cautiously, we decided to try it out.  We needed a good Sushi \"go to\" place and this location was totally spot on.   Always sit. At the bar.. first thing, both bartenders came up and shook our hands introducing themselves.   (Good move).  Service was totally great.  Food also proved excellent.  Diverse menu with a TON of traditional and creative sushi items as well as other traditional and non traditional Asian cuisine.    We had our normal wine and Titos and Soda, but they had an impressive custom drink menu (fresh juices etc...) and a respectable beer and wine list.   Quality was exceptional.  Price was not outrageous and the service was top notch.   We found our new go to place!"}
{"text":"Down to the important details  Food - had the Miso Ramen and it was amazing   Service - super quick and very friendly   Overall great new place, can't wait to go again and try the sushi. The beer selection was great and at a very reasonable price point.   Ps.  If you like spice ask for the chili powder (tasty)"}
{"text":"Just tried Yamazaru last week, very impressed.  This will me my new go to. Cool atmosphere. Awesome saki selection. I highly recommend the octopus balls for an appetizer. The sushi was extremely fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I agree with Matt F--service was slow and just so-so. Drinks were good-loved the stoli doli martini, but the transfusion's ingredients sounded good individually but the drink didn't come together. Really enjoyed salmon tacos and lettuce wraps (not enough filling for the lettuce). We had a sample of the homemade ginger beer which was really good. Overall, we were disappointed in the sushi, especially specialty rolls, which were either small in size (south end roll) and/or too much rice and little filling. Atmosphere was ok--our entire party felt Oku is much better in all areas."}
{"text":"Ramen was pretty  tasty.. If less salty  it will be great, just my opinion. :) I will definitely be going back there again."}
{"text":"Really, really impressed! Not overpriced. Great sushi. Great atmosphere. Will be our new go-to sushi place!"}
{"text":"I moved here from Los Angeles so I like to think I am quite spoiled when it comes to good sushi. Have been pretty disappointed with majority of the sushi here in Charlotte until I tried this spot out. Absolutely delicious. I would still go to the place if it was in LA and that's saying something. They have great thick cuts of fresh fish and it is at a completely reasonable price. $5 hand rolls this tasty? Yeah, I'm in. Definitely quite busy always as it's only open for dinner but definitely worth your money."}
{"text":"I love Rusans. So this is the tapa version of Rusans. Smaller portions, smaller sushi menu, but FULL bar. It's not as loud and overly crowded compared to Rusans. Rusans is great for a huge group. yamazaru is great for small dinner dates/get-togethers. Definitely a must try! I'm not a pork belly fan but their pork belly in their steam bun appetizer and in the ramen is good!! GOOD! Not too thick or thin cut, not too salty, and flavoring is great!   Green curry mussels appetizer is great. Light and refreshing. Curry is NOT thick. And awesome flavoring.   Drinks are great. My favorite is the cucumber basil! So freaking refreshing especially since summer is coming around.   I'm not a ramen expert. BUT...I would say try the Tonkotsu ramen. Only thing I would add is extra spice but that's because I like spicy! Otherwise, it was good. The boiled egg wasn't over cooked. It was medium. That's how I like it! Yum.  I also like their brussel sprouts! I think it's chargrilled? I would ask for it to be crispier but that's how I  would prefer it!   They still have the hamachi kama, the infamous seafood fried rice, and some other Rusans favorites on the menu.   I always feel so welcome and at home. Lots of love to Hata and Eric! They ALWAYS take great care of me and whoever I am bring with rather it's here or Rusans."}
{"text":"Good sushi. Fresh and decent portions. Sampled the Toro, Hamachi, Amaebi, and the Angry Spider. I would definitely come back without hesitation. Busy Friday night and food came super fast."}
{"text":"Very nice service. Just the right balance of courteous and friendly. Welcoming and accommodating to individual diners. Good, authentic Japanese tea (if you've been to Japan,you know bancha.) Nice Japanese dishes like hiya yakko and onigiri. If you miss Japan, you can get a taste of it here. I like it!"}
{"text":"This place has reasonably priced rolls and great variety, service was fast even though the restaurant was packed. The only issue is how small the restaurant is, if it was bigger than wait times for tables would be shorter. All around this place is a must go! I will be back again!"}
{"text":"This is a very good place for vegetarians who want to try Japanese cuisine. I personally loved their veggie fresh roll, veggie cucumber roll, avocado maki and sea weed salad. Its a must try for all the vegetarians out there."}
{"text":"We found this place by googling sushi places in Charlotte and decided to give it a shot. We always sit at the bar so we walked right in and sat down. We were greeted immediately with a VERY warm welcome from Gus, the bar manager. Started us both with waters, pointed out the special and some other favorites to start out with. We started out with the tartar which I have never had before but my boyfriend insisted I try something new. It was SO good. The flavors were there and the chips which were made from some type of root, were great! Moving on to dinner, I was so overwhelmed I had no idea what I wanted. Asked for some help and got several different choices. I ended up getting the Dancing Eel and New Moon rolls. If I had more room in my stomach I would have eaten more. Hands down the best restaurant I've been to in a long while. Not only is the food delicious, but the service is outstanding not just from Gus, but everyone who walked by. Gus was very good to us and we will definitely be returning to try more!"}
{"text":"I am still insulted every time Yamazaru doesn't make the best sushi in Charlotte various listings. IT IS AMAZING. The restaurant itself is small, but the staff makes sure that everyone gets in if you are willing to wait. What I love most is that once you are in they truly let you enjoy your dinning experience. You don't feel rushed to eat and pushed to leave.  The star of this place (other than the food) is the bartender. Yasss Gus the bartender is the sole reason I began coming here weekly. He is personable and takes the time to talk to each customer before whipping up a creation or one of the incredible options from the drink menus. he truly has a passion for mixology as he makes all his mixes from scratch - including marinating the fruits that garnish various drinks.    I take any and every one of my friends here first for Gus, then for the food!"}
{"text":"Oh my god: reasonable prices and best sushi ever. Get there early or expect a short wait.... which is well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Hard 2. This restaurant had not one but multiple poor things happen after another.   Do they have high chairs? Nope. Weird, especially if someone tries to bring out a quiet kid early on a weeknight.  I came here on an off night and the service was pretty poor and slow. Ordered over $100 of (what should have been) sashimi, but realized two minutes later I never specified whether or not it was sashimi or nigiri. The waiter never asked, and when I tracked him down and asked if they could make anything remaining sashimi, he said they made all of them. All of them? That would have made more sense if it didn't take another 20+ minutes for the plate of nigiri.   I'd say generally the additional sushi rolls were pretty good. The nigiri, which we picked off the balls of rice, were at best average. Fatty tuna was expensive and exceptionally mediocre. Scallops were very good (my favorite thing), uni was above average, but was otherwise pretty damn disappointed. Our waiter also disappeared for 25+ minutes and I had to go track him down for the check. I can appreciate the place getting busy, but the wait was absolutely unacceptable.  I'd recommend going to O-Ku and spend the extra two minute walk to Sycamore. The two places are similarly priced but O-Ku had a significantly better menu, much better service, and a better quality of food."}
{"text":"We heard about this new place from our Japanese friends so we decided to give it a try. If you don't want to wait, you need to come before 7 or make reservation ahead of time. There are plenty of parking spaces next to the restaurant and on the street. They have a good selection of Izakaya dish (small tapas style).  Some of the highlights: Tako yaki has a good portion of octopus inside it. The Gindara miso is tasty and the Hamachi Kama is huge and meaty. We finished the night with Tonkatsu ramen. The ramen has a good texture and the broth is wonderful. It would have been better if I can add several slices of pork and bean sprouts. I would have given them a five stars if the acoustic of the restaurant is better. It was hard to converse with the person across the table."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Yamazaru Saturday evening, as I was having a major sushi craving. Yamazaru is definitely now in the running for my favorite sushi in Charlotte!  Parking- There is a parking lot beside it so don't let South End parking scare you away!  Service- Service was spot on. We sat outside and our waiter was super attentive.  Drinks- They had a big drink list but we just got Sapporos  Food- We started with Edamame. Nicely salted and perfect pre-dinner portion. For rolls we got the Spicy Tuna roll, the UFO roll, and the Yamazaru roll. All three were delicious. Super fresh tasting. The winner by a land slide was the Yamazaru Roll. The flavors in it were insanely amazing! Everyone around us was eating Ramen and it looked soooo good!  Value- This is where Yamazaru takes the cake. The sushi prices are absolutely fantastic. Most rolls were under $10! Our total bill was incredibly reasonable!  Absolutely will return!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi place! One of the better ones in Charlotte, especially for the price. I had the tuna fresh summer rolls and they were awesome! At only $4 per roll, I felt this was a great deal for so much fresh ahi tuna. I got the mango de tango roll and the rich and famous roll, both were delicious! The specialty rolls were a good size and under $10 a roll for the two I got. Their drinks also looked unique and sounded great, I will be trying a few of them next time. Overall, I had a great experience here and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Yamazaru! I admit I'm a picky sushi eater and won't go just any place. The environment, while a bit crowded (it was a Saturday night), was fun/entertaining but intimate enough to have a conversation. The drinks were great and the bartender went out of his way to be helpful by letting me try some different gins I had not heard of. I had a few sushi rolls and they looked great and tasted even better. I didn't find them outrageously priced either. Our server, Phat, was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend this place for some great sushi. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"I am not a sushi lover, but I could eat here any night. Brought my sushi loving husband here for his birthday and everything we ordered exceeded expectations-- great food, service, atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yamazaru does some things very well and some things very poorly. Their sushi and fried rice is great. Their ramen and udon soup is not (broth is very thin and flavorless). The bartenders are friendly and well intentioned, but the service is mind blowingly slow at times."}
{"text":"Awesome service by all.  I sat at the bar and the gentleman behind the bar was great.   Chicken fried rice is good with a nice blend. Highly recommend the Volcano roll and the steamed dumplings were also very tasty."}
{"text":"I have to say this place blew me away.  I travel a lot, and they have some of the most amazing sushi rolls and even the nigiri was awesome.  I had two of the signature cocktails and they just left me in awe - seriously.  The take all of this very serious: who actually creates an in house homemade ginger beer with lime infusion just for cocktails?  Or even better check this out: jalapeños soaked in vinegar and sake just for their signature mule cocktail.  Great atmosphere, trendy club vibe - and next door is a great brewery to boot!  Pure goodness!  Get some!"}
{"text":"The calamari tempura, rolls and drinks we had were fantastic!  I'm definitely returning."}
{"text":"Waited sitting for 20min without being served until I decided to stand up and leave. They are either disrespectful or disorganized to let people wait that long."}
{"text":"The best and most authentic Japanese food in town! I love all their appetizers, ramen, rice dishes and great selection of sake!! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"We eat at Rusans which is the parent restaurant of Yamazaru once a week. Literally religiously. Tonight myself and a few girlfriends met to have a quick drink at the bar. The new (female) bartender put all our drinks on 1 check and then when we wanted to close out, told us they couldn't do split checks. I'm not sure what century POS system they have, but in my former life i worked in restaurants for 10 year and managed 3 and know there is always a capability to split checks. Additionally, as a regular of the other location, i know they are able to split checks so would be surprised to learn that this location is using a different system. As much as I like the food and the fact that they have a full service bar, I will not go back to this restaurant. I didn't ask for our checks to be on 1 tab so the bartender should not have done so. It was a pain in the a** for everyone to Venmo me money to cover their portion and due to this minor detail, I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurants and all around restaurants I've ever been to. We love it. We go almost once a week. All the sushi rolls are great and their appetizers/small plates are really well priced. We love the kiss of fire, tuna bomb, gladiator, and volcano rolls! The new Brussels are excellent and we always go for the tempura green beans. Great service too! Wish they were open for lunch!"}
{"text":"Nice place and good food. Service was a little slow but they was busy. I'll visit them again."}
{"text":"Yamazaru far exceeded our expectations!! Came here on a Saturday night for a casual birthday dinner & there was a long wait due to how small the place really is & no reservations unless it's for a big group but we've heard good things so we decided to stay. So happy we did because everything from the food, to the waiter & ambience were amazing!! The ginger salads and fried rice were favorites for the group as well as the combination sushi (nigiri & a special roll) as well as the kiss of fire!! For a group of 5, the waiter was very attentive and suggested so many great options! For the quality of the food, the sushi was very inexpensive and some of the freshest fish I've had in Charlotte! We have found our new favorite sushi place for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen and Yamazaru roll for take out. Everything was packed very nice and the food was amazing. Customer service was great as well. I cant wait to come back and try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant in town! Good prices and quality, as well as the atmosphere.  Can't go wrong here! #ieatmoresushithanyou"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I call this place fancy Ru San's! We've really enjoyed making it part of our sushi rotation. We've been a few times, but I still feel we have only ordered a very small segment of the menu.   This restaurant is done by the same people as Ru San's and the menu has some familiar items on it, such as the Crispy Tuna. We usually stop by in search of the Zootopia roll. It was a special roll at Ru San's for a while but they discontinued it. It's so good. It is salmon, asparagus, cream cheese and then deep fried! We also love the Southend roll, which is light, lemony and fresh!  I think the atmosphere is great. It's \"trendy\" and nice but not \"fancy.\" We have always had good and attentive service.   If you are a sushi fan, I recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and fast service  Very alive and hopping atomsphere  Tonkitsu Ramen was yummy and the pork belly was succulent.   Agedashi Tofu was solid, the sauce a good  flavor, the tofo was a bit firm and bland. Tha accompanying shishito pepper were bland.   The cucumber salad was very thinly sliced pieces including seeds soaked mainly soy sauce only. I did finish.   The tako yaki, fried octopus balls were pretty tasty and were chewy.   Kalbi was tough and very chewy,  dry and an had an off taste... i had to send this dish back since i did not want to eat it not take it home. They kindly this is dish off the check  Again overall, a good average to slighly above Japanese with really good prices.   I will get sushi next time..."}
{"text":"First off, I have to say I LOVE sushi. And this place has some really fresh food, some of the freshest I've had. I always love going here to get dinner and the atmosphere is great.  Overall I have no complaints with the quality of the food, but my issue is with getting it. Sushi normally takes a fair bit of time to come to the table and I get that, but they take FOREVER here. I could be waiting upwards of 45 minutes to an hour before getting food. There's also the fact that if you order over the phone, they'll put you on hold for 30 minutes with the restaurant ambiance of people eating and the bartenders making drinks in the background. It takes less than a minute to write down a call-in order, even if you're busy.   I had to hang up because my phone died while I was on hold...with a restaurant...on a day in the middle of a work week. Come on...that shouldn't happen... Worth noting too that it's happened more than once, it seems they put callers on a low-priority list when it comes to ordering food. I'm okay with waiting a few minutes or so but after spending enough time for me to actually have my cell phone die on me while holding is absurd. That definitely turns me off from wanting to call after a long day at work to get some great food. Kind of a shame, really.  Foods good though, if you have 2-3 hours to spare for dinner. I recommend the sushi rolls for everyone who loves Japanese cuisine, and the Kiss of Fire is phenomenal. Don't hesitate to try everything, all of their menu items are freaking delicious."}
{"text":"Yamazaru is the best kept secret in Charlotte! It has delicious sushi and an awesome atmosphere. And their moscow mule is made with homemade ginger beer!"}
{"text":"I've only sat at the bar the few times I've come and the service was great. Gus's drinks were even better. He makes a mean dirty martini. And the sushi is to die for... fresh, flavorful and original. It's a little hidden gem."}
{"text":"The Grinch roll is fantastic and very inexpensive! West woods and kiss of fire rolls are also delicious."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi spot anywhere. Prices are so reasonable and the food is incredible. My favorites include the pork gyoza, the Westwood roll, the Dancing Eel roll, and the salmon nigiri. The space isn't huge, but the wait is well worth it. We occasionally order out when we're absolutely starving (be prepared to call quite a few times), and the quality of the food doesn't suffer at all. I wish they had lunch hours! If you love sushi and haven't been here yet, make this a priority."}
{"text":"After trying ru sans I had to try their sister restaurant... and I'm glad I did !!! I'm in love with Yamazaru !"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sushi spot. Great location in the Southend. The sushi was sooooo good. Very meaty! The service was absolutely amazing. I loved the atmosphere. It was a fun spot for girls night. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Finally found a reasonably priced sushi spot with great food. I have found that Charlotte either has high priced/high quality sushi or average priced/low quality sushi.   Yamazaru has average pricing for a small sit down sushi restaurants to but the quality is comparable to their restaurants where you pay two to three times as much.   The staff is friendly and checks on you often to ensure you have everything you need, refilling your waters everytime they visit.   The sushi is very fresh and well crafted. They have tons of options to choose from and some of the rolls are very unique. The takeout is easy and quick without sacrificing quality or service.   The restaurant itself is visually appealing and clean. They have a large, fully stocked bar to eat/drink at in addition to the actual sushi bar.   Located right in the heart of South End, it is a great addition to the area."}
{"text":"Amazing !!!!!! The fish was super fresh their wine selection in really great and the service is friendly and caring. One Little girl was acting up and one of the waiters gave her mom a chi-chew candy to make her happy super nicely (making sure to ask the mom before letting the girl see it , in case she wasn't allowed to have it ."}
{"text":"Really well priced, but that's about it. It's a great setting, and has extensive menu, the food presentation looks great, but the taste...is just lacking.   The sashimi platter just didn't taste fresh - maybe they had an off day or something. We ordered noodles and some rice bowls. The ramen didn't stand out, and the udon noodles had soggy tempura that wasn't even warm. It was clearly fried earlier in the day and just left sitting in the kitchen...The unami bowl was filled to the brim with white rice, but the sauce was just lacking.   Overall, if you want a quick and cheap place to satisfy your Japanese cravings, come here. Otherwise, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great spot in Charlotte. Great service and amazing food. The sushi rolls. The appetizers. The sake. All... Yes. Yes. Yes. I will hands down, say that this place has my favorite appetizer in the QC now (fujimori). We had the tuna toro tartar...yes.  The fujimori was obviously amazing since it's now my favorite app in this whole city. Hold on, let me pause, because we started w/ miso soup, & this often gets underwhelmingly noticed; we are very cold natured folks and typically start out every meal with soup, so we comment on every. single. soup.  So, our comment on this miso was....drumroll...fabulous! Enough seaweed and tofu to make one very happy. After the soup, we were still cold, & our wonderful sever (Phat) turned the air up for us. Love! So, back to the food- after the soup, we indulged in the toro, the fujimori, and then the rolls. The Westwood and the Jawbreaker. Both must-haves. The Westwood was awesome...an easy \"yes\".  The Jawbreaker, though. I get it. You break your jaw from it dropping through the floor after tasting the amazing delicacy of this roll. Yummmm.  My fiancé doesn't care too much for seared salmon, but this slightly seared scrumptiousness had even him salivating. We sipped on the one hot sake offered on the menu during the whole meal and it was a perfect accompaniment. So, formal review: Service, A+; Food taste/quality/showmanship/etc, A+++;  Atmosphere, A, casual but trendy and slightly loud space (could use some carpet to absorb noise).  Basically, we were already planning what we would order next by the time our bill came & while we were unbuttoning the top button of our pants to finish that meal. Yeah, we'll be back....for the ramen, the Japanese curry, the many other apps we didn't get to, the many other sushi rolls we didn't try, and of course, the sake and the wonderful service."}
{"text":"So I found this Japanese restaurant located right beside Sycamore Brewery after indulging in National IPA. The location is perfectly located in the heart of South End around the breweries and other local favorites in the area.   First off, it's perfect that I can walk to restaurant. The staff for the most part got us seated pretty quickly since it was just moderately busy. The decor is ok and the size is a bit on the smaller side, so I can see that being an issue when more people discover this place.   The waitress was pretty nice and professional, knowledgeable to the extent that she was correct.   I ordered the citrus infused sake, some berry martini drink, scallop ceviche, the Caribbean roll (on special), and a couple of other items. It all was delicious! No complaints on the taste of the food and the quality of the seafood.   All in all, I would definitely, and am, going again!  --TrizzyO_o"}
{"text":"From out of town. High ratings are accurate. Saturday night the place was packed but I got a place at the sushi bar as I was alone. Great service and prices. Extensive menu. Good Sushi."}
{"text":"Such a great find! I've been in charlotte for three years now and have never heard of or found Yamazaru in my search for sushi. I recently moved around the corner from it and decided to try it. Great decision! The service is so quick and and on top of things. The sushi is so so so good and the prices are cheap for sushi. I had the edamame, the ufo roll, and the mochi ice cream.   The edamame, not so good. It was shriveled up as though it was microwaved. The ufo roll- amazing. Flavors and freshness on point. Good portions and price. Mochi was also delicious but I was disappointed as it listed chocolate and mango and when it came out t was 2 strawberry and 1 green tea. Nonetheless, delicious stuff.   We went on a Saturday evening and with a party of two there was no wait even though others were waiting!  The parking seems easy as they have a whole lot for the building but it's the only business open at night, but we chose to walk there on the light rail"}
{"text":"Yamazaru is my favorite sushi spot in Charlotte! I've been a handful of times and always had a great experience. The prices are fair and the sushi has always impressed me. My favorite two rolls are the west woods and the ufo. The service has also been great every time I have been. I would definitely consider the prices at Yamazaru very good for the quality sushi and service.  They don't take reservations and get quite crowded on the weekends."}
{"text":"Pleasantly delighted! Positive experience overall. Although I went when there was a low tide, so service was pretty good. I ordered Three Kingdoms and Zootopia upon the waiter's suggestion. I loved Zootopia, mainly, because I love tempura sushi. All of the ingredients were fresh and well combined. The water tasted a little strange though. Overall, I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"It's like If Rusans had a a hotter sister. That's Yamazaru in my personal opinion. Haha"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal!! I eat sushi. I eat a LOT of sushi. I love it and would eat it every day if I could. I was visiting Charlotte when I did a Yelp search for sushi places around me. Yamazaru popped up as #2 or 3 on a list of a number of places to visit. I read a quick review or two, but honestly based on proximity and what I read, we chose this place. It was meant to be. I have not had as deliciously fresh sushi in many other places as I did today. It was tasty. It was delicious. It was amazing. How many other adjectives would you like me to use??? This one is getting bookmarked and I promise you, you will do so as well. I don't write many Yelp reviews.. .as a matter if fact.m, I don't think I've ever written any, if maybe one. But after this meal, I felt as if it were my duty to share what I experienced here today. PS - as an added bonus, the staff was amazing and off the chain! I already cannot wait to come back. I eat a lot of sushi."}
{"text":"Get the flavored Sake. It comes in a sake box and it is delicious!   Also, make reservations because they are always booked!   We always get the following: 3 oz Sake (Comes in a Sake Box)  Green Tea Ice Cream"}
{"text":"YESSSS!!! Do it!! If you're wondering whether to try this place or not! Go in! It's amazing. We've gone twice already and it go even better the second time. The wait was not long at all. We sat at the bar which has a lot of space let me tell you. We order a million appetizers which they have so much to choose from. We picked the fresh tuna roll, wings, whole octopus, calamari, taki yaki, pork belly buns, kimchee salad, bacon wrapped scallops, beef tataki, tuna salad, salmon kama yaki. This was all just appetizers and yes we ate every bit of it. For entrees we got the tonkatsu ramen, and chirashi. The tonkatsu was amazing. Not to salty or bland. It was just right. The chirashi was extremely fresh. We loved everything!! Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Nice..better than advertised. Love the low key atmosphere. Tuna tasted very fresh and Brussels sprouts were exceptional."}
{"text":"Yamazaru is my favorite Japanese spot in town. Unlike the hipster restaurants that slim their menu down to just a dozen options or so, Yamazaru boldly offers a great selection of appetizers, sushi, noodles, and more. My coworkers have said good things about the rolls they've ordered, but my personal favorites are the una don (unagi over rice) and tonkatsu ramen. The una don is a delicious and filling alternative to the fancier rolls, while the quality of the ramen noodles here is the best I've had in Charlotte (mmhmm I'm looking at you, Futo Buta, and your over cooked noodles).  It's a shame they're only open for dinner, but even then their prices are reasonable for a Japanese restaurant. They're definitely packed during peak hours, but Sycamore Brewing is right around the corner, so it's not the end of the world to put your name down and grab a beer in the meantime."}
{"text":"New place on South End with very very fresh food. Menu has many selections to meet your cravings and well lit for evenings. Place has a parking lot and street parking so no worries there. Price is just right compared to other businesses. Definitely worth."}
{"text":"This sushi is one of the best, if not the best in town. I have had it take-out and eatten there. It's always packed but they are realistic about wait times. I can't even describe what makes it better - it might be the rice. I feel like they are snobs at O-Ku and Yamazaru is a normal spot that is just crushin' it. Perfect for a date, double date, post-Sycamore dinner, or take-out after a long day."}
{"text":"I think I may have eaten at a different place than what I have seen reviewed.  The service was absolutely 4+ stars as they were attentive and took orders quickly.  1.  The seaweed salad was fairly impressive and had a little heat which was a decent surprise and gave us hope for the dinner 2.  The gyozas were obviously not previously frozen however WOW ginger. I am thinking there was pork in the dumplings with that ginger.  3.  Forget the rest.      A. Way too much mayo on the tempura rolls. Why? It is shrimp that should be delicate while fried but it was smothered.      B. Kalbi should be a marinated korean beef. Kalbi roll was so sadly bland. Beef itself should have some flavor but this beef had flavor of none surrounded by rice.      C. Tuna bomb. The rice cakes were perfectly crispy. The tuna on top? So incredibly under seasoned it didn't taste like anything. It was something quite mushy on top of a very crispy rice cake which had zero salt on it as well.     D. Hamachi kama. HUGE serving of tuna cheek. Grilled on the bone and a great cut of fish. Zero seasoning and no marinade. It honestly had great consistancy but was so bland it had the flavor of tuna from a can.     E. Steam buns. Oh how I love pork. Grilled, fried, boiled, smoked. PORK. The steam buns had slivers of a basic bacon which may or not have been fine by themselves but were smothered in a sweet sauce. Futo Buta up the light rail can show you how pork belly should be served.   Again. I think I went to a different restaurant than the ones reviewed. After dinner we walked to Sycamore Brewery next door and saw the food trucks and realized our mistake. I am sure we would have found something with flavor on our south end adventure had we know the trucks were within walking distance."}
{"text":"I give this 5 stars because the atmosphere was fun and lively and the food was very good for the price. The onigiri appetizers were like $2-3 and they were a decent size and tasted great. I also got uni nigiri which pretty good quality and a yummy yamazaru roll. They had a nice selection of food and drinks to pick from."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start! This place blows away amy other for dinner. It's so good and reasonably priced that I eat dinner here every week! The drinks are on point and good is out of this world."}
{"text":"Found myself here because the crowd of Futo Buta was out of control. After eating here I might not go back to Futo Buta. The food here is amazing!  Started with the Toro Tartare - very tasty!  The brussel sprouts are delish!  Because it was freezing out, I ordered the Tempura Udon and a salmon avocado roll. Tempura shrimp and veggies were cooked to perfection and the broth was not too salty. The menu is manageable and I cannot wait to go back and try the Tuna Bomb."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. I recommend the crispy brussel sprouts and the Westwood's sushi roll."}
{"text":"Friendly and efficient service.  Carnos the sushi chef was awesome and easy to talk to.  Food came out paced. Food is as fresh as it gets. The gindara miso melted in my mouth. Sashimi buttery and fresh. Atmosphere hopping with activity. What more can you ask for in a dining experience?"}
{"text":"Great place for Sushi and other Asian food. The sushi here is outstanding, with a great selection of rolls available. Very nice drink and beer menu, and the service is also top notch. Has been very consistent as well. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My only issue is the readability of the menu. Millennials may have no problem reading it, but for boomers like me, you may need to use the flashlight option on your cell phone. Orange print on a tan background is not easy to read, especially in dim light!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got here no less than once a week. The sushi does not compare anywhere to another restaurant in Charlotte, they are by far the best!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner, we sat outside, the food was ok, I've had better sushi before but it was ok, for the sushi I'll be back, unfortunately the service was not that good.. took them long time to get our food and didn't was friendly at all.. I guess it was busy and it really depends on your waitress but we'll try again."}
{"text":"Love Yamazaru!  Great sushi for the whole family! The staff is friendly and efficient. The sushi is super yummy! And they have a full bar.  Love the intimate atmosphere with exposed brick, wood, and metal accents.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Best new sushi place in town. The atmosphere is fantastic the drinks are amazing and the food is great. Ramen bowl was delicious, tiger shrimp and Brussels sprouts were amazing. Sushi is fresh and the service is great!"}
{"text":"We went to Yamazaru on a Tuesday night around 7 p.m.  -  it was busy, but not too busy to grab a table (outside - yay!).  As several other reviewers have mentioned, service took awhile.  I assumed this was because we were sitting outside, but based on other reviews, that may not be the case.  I'm docking the star solely based on the service - everything took too long and we had to track down a server multiple times for drink orders.  That being said, the food was outstanding.  We enjoyed the tiger shrimp, chicken lettuce wraps, ahi poke, fatty tuna poke, and several pieces of nigiri.  The fish was generously cut and the seasonings were very tasty.    They also have a nice sake list with flights available."}
{"text":"Stranded in Charlotte tonight so  Yelped for a sushi place. Yamazaru is awesome with wonderful food, service and drinks! Great price too for the high quality of food !  We had dynamite roll it was delicious! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We had sushi club here this week and he sushi itself was very good for Charlotte. The cost was a little bit higher than some of the other sushi restaurants in town. The service was excellent and a great atmosphere. I'm sure ill be back as it has a perfect location next to sycamore. I'd recommend for a happy hour/early dinner"}
{"text":"One of the best Japanese or Asian restaurants in charlotte. Have tried a few items in the sashi, sushi rolls, rice bowls, udon and noodles. Nothing was disappointing yet. Been venturing into the appetizer recently. Yellowtail cheek is reallllly good and the grilled cod is amazing also (please see pictures)."}
{"text":"Picky about sashimi/sushi? Why yes, I am (very)...This place is in one word, \"yum\". Enough said."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Sushi spot. Amazing food with great service. We like to sit at the bar, Gusto the bar manager there provides the best dining experience you can get!! A must visit."}
{"text":"What a treat!  From the Steamed Buns to the Rich & Famous roll.   Super atmosphere and great vibe.  Must have sushi."}
{"text":"Friend and I went this place after work. Quite busy restaurant. We tried one kalbi for appetizer, two different ramens and the jawbreaker roll. kalbi was disappointed, taste like marinated beef which you can find in grocery market. Ramens were no to me, feel like instant noodle for 2 bucks. However the roll was really good, freshly and rich flavor. I will come go try more rolls later on."}
{"text":"NOM! The wife and I were having a little date night action and our first choice for sushi was a little too busy so we decided to step out and try Yamazaru.   Had to collect my socks from the parking lot because Yamazaru BLEW MY SOCKS OFF! Four rolls and two alcoholic beverages later, we escaped for under $50. Pretty impressive.   It was recommended to me to get the UFO and the Kiss Of Fire because, if you've read any of my other reviews, you know that if I'm not sweating, I'm not enjoying my meal. Let me tell you, Yelp audience - there are places that are fantastic and expensive, there are places that are good and inexpensive - Yamazaru takes the fantastic and the inexpensive and rolls it directly into your sushi roll. Cannot wait to go back, and I will bring an extra pair of socks this time."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, fast and friendly service, and great sushi. We really enjoyed this place! The prices are also very reasonable. Also, it's not all that far from the Fillmore."}
{"text":"Great new sushi restaurant by the owners of Ru San's. A bit smaller location and more upscale. Reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and this is definitely one of the better sushi/Japanese places in Charlotte. Their sashimi is always top-notch, if not a bit pricey. Straying away from sushi and sashimi, some of the other dishes don't quite hit the mark though. I've been pretty happy with the gyoza and the tonkatsu, although the tonkatsu is usually a bit tougher than I'd prefer. The yakisoba and the karaage were both big misses for me, and were bland. The karaage wasn't breaded enough, either, and was oily.   Putting my misgivings about some of the dishes aside, just on the merit of their sushi/sashimi offerings I'm giving them 4 stars. I'm not sure if they've updated their menus, but previously they stated they had both Kanpachi and Madai, but neither are stocked anymore, I believe due to a lack of demand."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great prices without the dingy dirty feel of most good traditional sushi places. drinks are delicious, service is great, prices are on point. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Yamazaru is the absolute best! It is a long overdue sushi (& more) establishment added to the Southend restaurant scene. I am an absolute 'sushi snob' who moved here from Chicago. The sushi grade, food quality, personal service and affordable prices make this restaurant stand out from all the rest. Gus, the bartender, is incredible! He's so attentive and makes the most amazing drinks. If you haven't tried his custom creation of ginger beer (used in many of the cocktails), ask for a sample! It will blow you away- so fresh, authentic and with a kick.  Hata-San is (to my understanding) the mastermind and guru behind the whole restaurant's concept. A true master of his craft and frequently found behind the bar &/or greeting customers. The food: Every recommendation from the staff is spot-on. Even if you're not a sushi (raw food) fan, there are plenty of menu options to enjoy. I personally like sashimi and nigiri. The fish selections literally melt in your mouth. As a self proclaimed 'sushi snob', I rate this place as an A+. Not to mention, the prices are so reasonable and not pretentious.  If you're looking for a place for a special night out or a regular neighborhood spot, I highly recommend Yamazaru!"}
{"text":"So I am an optimist. However this experience was the worst. Ordered 4 rolls and 2 beers. After like 35min our server comes back with 3 rolls. Then 10min later our beer. Then after another wait my roll. Before she brought pur beer she admitted she forgot. Then proceeded to blame the restaurant. Not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Food was good, from what I am told: the only problem I encountered was with the bartenders understanding what I was asking for. I am allergic to mayo so I cannot eat spicy mayo, I tried to express this to the bartenders and they seemed to act like they understood but it seems that they didn't. My boyfriend and I ordered food Togo since we live in the neighborhood, and when we arrived home to eat dinner which was suppose to be spicy mayo free, it turned out to be covered in spicy mayo. That was our first visit there, the second visit was just the same... my only recommendation to the Restuarant would be to hire a bartender who is fluent in English... sadly I do not believe I will return, although it is fortunate for my bank account since my diet is made up of miso soup and sushi."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night and the place was super busy, so we decided to sit out on the \"patio\". I put that in quotes because it is more like the sidewalk in front of the door with 5 hightop tables. The inside was very nice, and pretty cool setup for a sushi bar.   When other people were out on the patio getting water/drinks or food we got the shaft. Had to wait for over 15 minutes for water to brought out to the table. Then another 15 minutes to get our drinks. Our waiter took our order and was off, didn't see him again for about 45 minutes. At this point I started to get worried that he got lost, not to mention everyone was now gone from the \"patio\" so we were just hanging out on the \"patio\" without anymore water, with empty drinks, no food, and no music of any kind out on the \"patio\" just silence...cotton mouthed silence...  We did get our appetizer about an hour after we placed our order. We ordered the cream cheese dip, but it wasn't exactly what we thought it would be. Turns out cream cheese dip is actually 5 crab rangoon. Not sure why they would call it a dip, but hey it's their restaurant they can call it whatever they would like.   Our food came out about 30 mins after the appetizer. I was not blown away by the rolls, but they weren't bad.   Considering we didn't order anything that was cooked (besides our \"dip\") I feel like the service was a tad on the slow side (note the sarcasm). Not to mention, the waiter told my wife when she asked for more water \"you need to be patient\". Now he said it not in a pleasant it might be a moment kind of way, it came off in more of a hold your damn horses kind of way.  From being seated to eating and getting the check took well over 2 hours.  Overall I think this place could be cool, prices are about the same as other sushi places in the area, maybe a dollar or two cheaper. I would say don't sit out on the \"patio\" dine inside, and hopefully you will get better service, but if you got two and a half hours to kill, give the \"patio\" a shot.  Don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Go to sushi place in Charlotte. Delicious sushi for a fair price. Don't even bother with anything else on the menu. Go straight for the sushi!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a mid-week date night here recently. Here are the highs/lows: Highs: 1. Cool space, a bit raw and hidden right now but easy parking and good vibe. 2. Great specials - we tried some of their summer specials, including a ceviche with truffle oil that was amazing! 3. Friendly service - server was authentic, quick and personable.   Lows: 1. Expensive drinks - wine and sake options started at $11 and went up. I'm ok with paying premium for drinks but seems excessive.  2. Upsell - when we asked for recommendations, it was consistently the most expensive items on the menu.   Overall this is another good option for the are and always glad to have more high-quality asian places in the South End!"}
{"text":"Energetic atmosphere, great cocktails at reasonable prices. I love the various soups and ramens. Good value overall.   I have found the sushi to be a little bit inconsistent - sometimes great and sometimes just ok without the degree of consistency I would like to see (freshness and consistency of how thick it is sliced, etc)."}
{"text":"First time here at the service was great! I sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive and made me a custom drink. The sushi is delicious and you get a good amount for your money. Love the atmosphere and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing little hidden gem in Southend! I loved it! Will absolutely be returning.  All of the rolls we ordered were simply delicious! Wait staff was very attentive and we had a blast! Can't wait to go back.  Update. Went back and enjoyed it more than the first time! My husband ordered the philly and scorpion roll, and I had the Caribbean roll and the volcano roll. Absolutely amazing! This place does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a treat. We got in around 7:20pm and there was an hour long wait. So we decided to sit outside despite of the hat suggesting it's hot. We don't mind the sun. Pretty quickly the sun set around after 8 and it was nice and cool. We ordered the cucumber basil martini style and my eyes were wide with happiness. We ordered a bunch of sushi, sashimi and some kitchen appetizers. We were given a complimentary spicy mule drink and that made my boyfriends day. We enjoyed it a lot. Would defiantly recommend it and if you sit outside it's lovely. Casual attire is good. Plan to stay a while and eat some good sushi. It's worth the wait. The owners are super nice. We will definitely be going back very very soon."}
{"text":"$10 for a cocktail is criminal but the food is amazing and the service was super nice. Everyone was helpful and considering how busy it was my table of 4 got seated, waited, and fed really fast."}
{"text":"Came with a few friends and didn't mind waiting a while for a table. The manager was so sweet and bought us drinks while we wait! Staff is super friendly and the food was great! The New Moon roll is probably my favorite. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant. Can't wait to come back (:"}
{"text":"Let's start off with the front door experience... we're a party of four, we walk in, patiently wait. We see 4 spots open at the sushi bar (eeek my favorite sushi experiences occur at the sushi bar!) we try to get seated there. The host ushers us away and puts a reserved tag on the seats (it's 9:30pm in Charlotte ... no one was walking through those doors). We were seated pretty promptly after that. So while we didn't get the exact seats we wanted ... we were at least seated quite quickly.   The waiter was kind, but possibly overwhelmed. We ordered a fried rice and it came to the table with no extra plates. It took forever to waive someone over to bring some forks and plates. After what seemed like an extended period of time the sushi came! The waited dropped it off and was about to leave when we kindly asked him to let us know what each roll was. He wasn't totally sure. This seemed sort of odd to all of us. I've never been to a sushi restaurant ordered multiple rolls and then not had the waiter or waitress tell me what's on the plate.   Once we had an idea what each of the rolls were we dug in. The stand out -by far - was the West Woods roll. But to be completely honest, all the rolls, even the old faithful California rolls were spot on!we also ordered the Dancing W/ Star, the Tarzan and the Mango de Tango.  The fried rice was very tasty too. Next time I think I would ask for it with \"low oil\".   We noticed a lot of younger crowds enjoying sake. We did not partake this time, but definitely next time.   We will absolutely be back and look forward to next time!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. It was busy which is always great to see, so we opted to just site at the bar to speed things up. Our bartender was awesome, not only did he make us very good drinks--I had some mules and my wife had the gin berries, but he even was multitasking handling all his customers and training a new bartender as well. We got a few rolls, the zoothopia, Tarzan, and a basic sweet potato roll. It may have been a mistake on our part to get so many rolls with a creamy element to them with avocado/creamcheese, but it also just seemed like they all were doused in spicy mayo and eel sauce, so much so that we wiped it off of pieces. All in all, id go back for snacks/drinks."}
{"text":"Volcano roll was my favorite however the south end and kiss of fire were tasty!!!   FYI Maki rolls are the small rolls with rice on the inside and seaweed on the outside.    The customer service was on point and we did not wait long for the rolls.    Hata the owner was so sweet and attentive and helped with the menu and ensuring everything went well.   Eric was a fantastic server"}
{"text":"The more upscale of RuSan's with a very familiar and similar menu but with trendier atmosphere/setting. My friends love this spot for sushi because it's in the sweet spot between the more expensive, classy O-ku restaurant and the cheaper, wild RuSan's.  I've only been here once as of this writing and I was in the mood for a bowl of ramen. It was simple and solid. For ramen, I personally prefer the higher quality selections at Futo Buta for about the same price. I believe sushi is Yamazaru's specialty so next time I'll order that instead."}
{"text":"The best sushi in town :) fish is always fresh, prices are great and service is awesome!"}
{"text":"Yamazary is a great addition to the south end neighborhood. The sushi rolls were very good.  The seating in the restaurant is kind of small though.  I will definitely come here again in the future."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent sushi/sashimi that tastes just as good as it looks! Cocktails were excellent and at a great price point (get the spicy mule). Sitting at the sushi bar was a great idea!  Excited to live just a few blocks down and have a new regular sushi spot!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a Friday evening around 7:30pm and it was packed! We had a 30 minute wait which passed by pretty fast. They had a nice atmosphere and vibe to the place.   So we were seated in a 4 person booth and had already ordered our food when our waiter (maybe he was the manger since he wasn't wearing the uniform) came over and asked us to move table. There was another table in the back that seat 2 people and apparently there was a bigger party behind us that had more people and were waiting. While I understand that they would want to be more efficient with seating as many parties as possible it still came off really rude to make us move tables while we've been seating there for at least 10 minutes already.   For appetizer we got the tako yaki balls which were pretty good. The Cali sunset roll was average. Nothing too special. My friend got the tonkotsu ramen and it was not good at all. It was one of the worst ramen I've had and I've had a lot. Maybe it was an off day since everyone is raving how good the ramen was but I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We had a 15 hour layover and decided to check out a good restaurant and WOW! The ambiance, friendly staff, delicious food and drink was wonderful. Prices are more than fair.Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place with my fiancé and we loved it! Recommendations were great, staff was attentive even though they were busy, and the portion size of the Tonkotsu Ramen bowl was big enough for the both of us to split along with the sushi. We had the Mango de Tango and three kingdom rolls but we both enjoyed the Mango one more. We have been to Futo Buta for ramen and preferred this ramen bowl better. We also have been to O-Ku and Ru San's but agreed that this has been our favorite place (for dinner) to get sushi. Drinks pictured are their mojito and their lychee cosmo. The mojito was great but the lychee was a little sweet for me. Only downside was that it gets loud and crowded here. I'd rather come back and update this place to give it 5 stars once I know this restaurant is consistent at what they do!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks were exceptional. I took my hubs for his birthday. We enjoyed the sushi, noodle bowl and mules. Service could have been a little better but overall good place for a date night."}
{"text":"Get a reservation the day before because the place packs out quickly. It's great that you can park in the lot and when I say they have great cocktails, that's an understatement. Great service and great food. 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"Don't know why this place misses the lists of good sushi in Charlotte! Sushi with flavor and an ample amount of fish for a good price! No more sad tuna rolls jammed with cucumber."}
{"text":"Had a huge sushi craving that Yamazaru more than satisfied. Went straight to the sushi bar and went with the Mui Bueno roll which was out of this world. Service was wonderful. Great atmosphere was the cherry on top."}
{"text":"I love love love their sushi! The signature Yamazaru is the best! Also try the salmon takos! My favorite place for sushi."}
{"text":"My favorite Sushi and drinks. So good. The Tempura Philly and Spicy Mule are my go to here. Expect a wait usually because that is how good it is!! I recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"This is seriously the best sushi I've had in Charlotte. I've tried about every place in the area and I can say that hands-down they have the best quality fish in the area. If you're a sushi purist, and you want good fish that melts in your mouth, THIS IS WHERE YOU NEED TO GO!! Not to mention they have great appetizers, tempura, and donburi. I can't wait to make my way through the entire menu!"}
{"text":"I'm giving give stars because our visit on a Friday night, during peak hours was pleasant. This is a nice place to come to grab dinner, lunch, or with friends.  They've got a huge bar, a separate sushi bar seating area, a few regular tables and booths, and an outside seating area (felt a little awkward since it's right by the only entrance/exit). We sat outside because inside was so packed. It took a minute for our server to come to us (3 couples were sat out there at the same time), because no one told her they gave her tables, so communication could be a little better. Also for  a Friday night, they could have used a few more servers. Overall the service was good for a busy time.  The food was really good and fresh! We ordered mostly sushi items. For appetizer we had the Tuna tataki.  It was okay, I felt the sear could use a little more flavor, but the fish was fresh, and i enjoyed the spiral radish that came with it. I ordered the Krystal roll that was phenomenal! I think that's the best roll I've ever eaten. It's unique that they have a good variety of rolls without rice! I also had the spicy tuna maki which was delicious as well, I enjoyed that it was actually spicy and the Tuna wasn't skimp like most places.  My husband ordered the UFO which was delicious, and a spicy tuna.   The menu offers a variety of items not just sushi, but from our experience the sushi was on par with my fave Rusans. I judge my sushi visits based on my love for their sushi.  One thing I noticed is that there were several menu items that are identical to Rusans, so maybe the same people own it, which would explain the quality, similar menu, and familiar wait staff faces, just too many coincidences for there not to be a connection. I will definitely come back here, and it's worth riding the light rail on lunch from uptown to here (already planning that lunch day lol)."}
{"text":"tonight was my first time here and it will definitely not be my last! our waitress, aya, was the absolute best! so personable, enthusiastic, and awesome!! the food was really great and i thoroughly enjoyed my visit! be sure to go check this place out!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed as I was looking forward to trying this place after I saw raving reviews. Took forever to get our food and we got our items in very off timing. One person got their entree then it took 15 minutes for another entree to arrive. The waiter brought out a dish I didn't order, then charged me for it. I mainly wanted to try the place because they had yakisoba noodles and I never got to try then. I didn't even eat the food they charged me for. To top it off, the Rangoon was cold in the middle- it was just a bummer. I hope it was just an off day and if/when I return, the experience will improve."}
{"text":"Great Food - Great Cocktails And GREAT Service!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! Sit at the bar & Gus will create your new favorite drink!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and each experience was delightful.  Yamazaru is tucked away behind an apartment community. The ambience is nice and cozy.  Gus was the bartender on both nights that I visited. He's friendly and helped with recommendations on food and specialty cocktails. He's an awesome bartender.  They also make their syrups in house.  The sushi is good and fresh!  I also had their crab cake puppy or shall I say puppies because you get three. They were amazing!!  The beef tataki is also good.  I'm not usually a fan of rare meat, but this dish was very flavorful didn't even bother me that the meat was lightly seared.  Great place for after work cocktails and sushi or a date night."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came here for a fun ladies night out. The restaurant was very nice and trendy! The sushi was good but very small servings for the price. The calamari was great, the drinks were delicious! This service left much to be desired. I'm not sure who our server was, as we just had to grab people as they walked to get any service. In addition to that is was also very slow. It wasn't a horrible experience, but I'm in no rush to return."}
{"text":"We love this sushi spot!  Best in CLT in my opinion.  Always fresh!"}
{"text":"Pass by it everyday, always wanted to try. Glad I did. Came here for a date night with the boyfriend around 8 pm. Very busy. We were greeted right away by a young man who took our names and gave us an estimated wait time of 25 mins. We decided to get a drink at the bar while we waited. Granted the bar was packed so it took a while before we got our drinks, but took a look at there impressive cocktail list. From what I saw was mostly made up of customized martinis. Didn't have one, but from they looked tasty! We got two Japanese beers that were on tap. We got sat in about 20 mins and ordered 2 appetizers and 2 sushi rolls. Everything was delicious and I highly recommend this place. The space is a bit small, but good food. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was our first experience at Yamazaru.  In a concise summation: Reasonably priced and delicious.    Let me just start by saying that I am obsessed with Ru Sans (kind of in an embarrassing way). We sat down and looked at the sushi selection.. a lot of the rolls shared the same names as ones at Ru Sans.. My boyfriend did some good ol' google research and sure enough, the owner is the same.  Anyhow, we tried two rolls that I hadn't seen on Ru San's menu - the South End roll and the Tarzan - both were delicious!  The South End has thin slices of lemon on top (including the rind), which was wasn't sure about at first but it was AMAZING.  I will definitely order this one again.  Tarzan has avocado on top and cream cheese inside so if you're a fatty like me and you love both of those things, this one is a good pick too.  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"So my girlfriend loves this place. It is a small spot. I stopped in Saturday mid-day. It wasn't too busy I was ordering to go at the bar. The bartender I had was not very helpful with the menu. They didn't know the specials and couldn't help make any suggestions for my first time being there. I do have to say that once they found somebody who knew the menu and told me the sushi special for the day that's what I got. It was delicious. My girlfriend loves the noodle dish with chicken she gets it with broccoli and onions. Overall, I like the food and the service was so so. The speed of the to go order was pretty slow considering it wasn't super busy in there. I would go back and try to dine in next time. I can't forget to leave out I liked how the host open the door and even pulled out my chair for me at the bar."}
{"text":"Okish !! Not great.. too much sesame in everything. Ambience and music is good. Service is quick. Appetizers are good.. but main course is bland. Fried rice and fried noodles are not fried kind of sticky and wet!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. We walked here on a nice night and 2 minutes after we get there the power goes out. Luckily the bar started clearing out so we were able to get seats quickly after the power came back on. Definitely get the Southend roll and the kiss of fire."}
{"text":"This is our new sushi hangout. Fresh sushi, friendly service, a dedicated parking lot and little or no wait time. Can't beat that! We love the Hamachi Habanero dish...I can eat 3 orders all by myself.  The tuna taco is also a must.  Tip: Stick with the sushi; skip the ramen...go to Futo Buta for that."}
{"text":"For a new-ish restaurant, Yamazaru has hit the ground running and had me already planning our next visit as we left.  I went with a Hop Drop & Roll, which came from a can rather than a draft, but it was fine and very cold which made it perfect.  My wife got a Cucumber Basil cocktail, which she said was a little sweet but otherwise tasty.  For our appetizer, we tried the Tiger Shrimp.  What we expected: shrimp with some sort of mild dipping sauce and some inedible vegetation garnish.  What we got: eight large perfectly-cooked shrimp, in a relish/sauce that was truly surprisingly spicy and contained cucumber, avocado, onion, and some other indistinguishable but delicious ingredients.  They also came with four rice cakes which allowed us to make sort of open-face shrimp tacos, which were delicious.  This appetizer was really amazing, and it had us excited for what was to come.  The main haul for the evening included the following:  Tofu avocado roll Spicy salmon roll Philly roll UFO roll Rainbow roll Uni nigiri Salmon nigiri  We came hungry and ate it all.  I will spare the details of what each roll contained as it's readily available online, but suffice to say each roll was excellent.  I can only speculate the philly roll was good, since I don't \"roll\" with cream cheese in my sushi, but my wife enjoyed it very much.  A few highlights:  The tuna and salmon on the Rainbow roll were very good, but the yellowtail was a special cut of fish that night.  It had a subtle, clean sweetness that I'd never experienced before.  I really enjoyed that.  I'd seen the UFO roll mentioned here on Yelp before and decided to try it.  I'm normally not a huge fan of tempura fried sushi rolls, but I'd order this again in a heartbeat.  The varying contrasts and flavors along the sauces drizzled over each piece were really delicious.  My favorite bite of the night had to be the uni.  You know how avocado is sometimes referred to as \"nature's butter\"?  Well, after popping the uni into my mouth, my first thought was that uni is the \"butter from the sea\".  It is so creamy, rich, and briny, it just tastes like something Aquaman would make to impress a date.  It's not cheap at $4/piece, but it was well worth it and I won't be able to come back here without getting at least one.  Service was impeccable, decor was pleasant, and the food was killer.  I'm happy to say that the next time we're feeling sushi, we won't have to think about where we're going to go."}
{"text":"This is owned by the same owners of Ru Sans. Our FAVORITE sushi place! Yamazaru is a step up dining experience. A little more intimate where as Ru Sans is super casual. Their drink menu is  with a lot more handcrafted cocktail choices. And they have their classic sushi rolls. Not much difference in pricing at all! Love love love!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place last week but finding a place 2 Park was frustrating-~ so I arrived 15mins b4 they opened & I was able to find a parking spot right in front of the door. I wasn't the only person to arrive 15 mins early ~ 5 other parties were waiting as well.  The sushi is average ~ i gave it 5 stars because they have outside seating & the waiter was attentive, knowledgeable & hilarious!!!!!   I started with lemon water (because the water container was cute \o/) I opted to try the \"Up the Pagoda\" which is 3 \"shots\" of 3 different types of Sake ~ they were good.   I then tried the Jawbreaker (which I thought would've been spicy) NOPE! The sweet crunchiness of the roll stole my heart. I also had the Scorpion roll ~ a basic American roll. The shrimp fried rice was good ~ definitely a serving for 2 people to share.   They had 1 item on the menu that I'm dying to try ~ Octopus ~ but I'll wait until my homegirl gets here so I can have her cheerlead me on. Lol."}
{"text":"They had a wide array of items on their menu from Korean style, Japanese style, ramen dishes, entrees and sushi. The servers were very attentive.   I ordered a ginger salad and the mui bueno roll. The pieces were very large and fulfilling."}
{"text":"Seems over rated. Waited 5 minutes at the front door before being greeted. We flagged down a busser to ask to be put on the waiting list. Not a hospitable bunch at all. They were out of some menu items and the beer I ordered. The food was good but not great. Knife work on sushi was mediocre and rolls were not rolled right. We will continue our search for our favorite sushi spot."}
{"text":"Do not give waitress your entire order - we ordered  appetizers  and main dishes - they all came out together- I was quite annoyed as I wanted a break in between. I ended up eating my main dish first as I did not want the chill of my sushi to warm.  We complained to our waitress and she said sorry I told the manager.  If \"Aya\" really told the manager he should have come to our table.  Poor customer service.  IF we go again will order appetizer and than give main dish order after or make sure the waitress is seasoned enough to know appetizers come 1st"}
{"text":"One of the best Japanese restaurants in Charlotte. Good taste and affordable price. Love their Chirashi bowl!  Have been their for two times but they never have the Hamachi Kama available on the menu."}
{"text":"OMG! Amazing sushi! This is a hidden gem on Hawkins street. Be sure to check those hours before you go. I believe they are not open Sundays and Mondays. There were several vegetarian roll options as well. This place is great to bring friends or business associates. There are so many delicious options, it's hard to choose. By far the best sushi I've had since I've been to CLT."}
{"text":"This place is going to kill it. We arrived on a Wednesday about 6:30 and the tables were full. We gladly pulled up to the bar. The bartenders were amazing! Brian and Mike took great care of us. Brian was super friendly. Introduced himself and shook our hands.   The spicy mule is their signature cocktail and my new favorite drink. They make homemade ginger beer so its not overly sweet. The ginger comes out strong as does the spiciness.   I didn't think the sushi was super memorable, but the pricing is great compared to other places in the area. I did really like the mango tango. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First I had the fresh tune appetizer, it was delicious as spicy! Great. The main specialty rolls were, the volcano roll (right) and the surf and turf roll (left). Both are good, but I love the soft and turf!!!"}
{"text":"Looking at the reviews, i thought this might be a good place for authentic Japanese sushi, but nope. Very Americanized. If you love rolls, they have plenty of rolls. Our server didnt have any knowledge of the fishes or its origin. Every time i'd ask she would keep having to go and ask the chefs. And every time she came back the answer was \"West coast.\" It was funny when i asked her if the Uni was Nama Uni from Japan, she said its sea urchin. LoL  Service was ok, only ordered a couple of nigiri and waited about 20mins, and they were out of half of the exotic fishes. Overall, if you love rolls this is your place. if you're looking for authentic Japanese sushi, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"The service was incredibly slow. The food was ok but a bit over priced. I didn't like the tacos, they were very small and lacked flavor. I am not sure that I would go back for anything but the drinks."}
{"text":"Great addition to Charlotte's Southend Asian-cuisine scene! I always have other Rusans, who also opened this spot, and they surely live up to those standards! The vibe is modern and fun-- great date spot or girls night out spot. The menu is varied, but the sushi is the way to go! Our service was amazing and the manager came around to ensure our time was delightful-- which it was!"}
{"text":"Service - Incredibly slow. 15-20 minutes for edamame. 20 minutes for a pepper appetizer. 45 minutes to get 5 rolls of sushi. 15 minutes for the waitress to return to our table so she could go swipe my card - I actually took it to the host for her to swipe since our table grew tired of waiting. Very slow.   Food - Really good. The only reason this isn't a 2 star review. All the sushi we tried was awesome.  Atmosphere- cool venue. Just enough space. Not super tight. Right next to Sycamore Brewery."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite spots in Charlotte for sushi!  Love sitting at the sushi bar and watching them create such beautiful food, and looking at all the varieties of fish.  They offer a great selection of specialty and traditional sushi rolls, and a wide variety of sashimi!  All are incredibly delish.  Cocktails are great and they have a good selection of local drafts.  For sushi, it isn't a bad price either!"}
{"text":"Between 2.5 to 3 stars.  Service is spotty.  Need to ask multiple times for things we need, especially they weren't busy at all at 6pm.  Is it fast casual?   Not really, but they left a bottle of water which I don't mind.  Is it full service?  Yes, expecting 20% service fees with the excellent service correspondence to it; but no, it didn't deliver.  Sushi is avg at best.  No wasabi between the rice and fish.  Rice is not vinegarette.  Rice is also mushy.  Price is avg, it seems like you get what you paid for.  Definitely better quality than their sister restaurant  @ru san's,  but still a tad off from being solid 3 or 4 stars.  Will give it one more shot."}
{"text":"may be new. but doubt it will last long. food was average. service was alright. This guy who said he was the manager was very rude when I asked why my food was a little cold. I'd take a pass on this place."}
{"text":"A really great place to get Japanese food in South End. I order the Sushi Combo E that came with 10 pieces of nigiri sushi, the tuna avocado roll, and the kiss of fire roll (along with some miso soup). It was delicious! I was particularly impressed by the kiss of fire roll. On top of that, the waitress was attentive (especially considering how busy they were) and the atmosphere was trendy. I'll be back to try more for sure."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent sushi restaurant and fairly cheap for what we had ordered. We dropped by on a Saturday around 7. The place was ridiculously packed and we were quoted for an hour wait but it honestly didn't take that long so don't be discouraged when they quote you a long wait time. We ordered a few appetizers. None were that memorable except for the hamachi jalapeños. IT IS A MUST TRY. I was tempted to order a second one but stopped myself. The fish quality here is above average, and I absolutely loved the spicy scallop nigiri and the uni nigiri which were both naturally sweet and creamy. Although, I didn't get a chance to try the signature rolls here, I will give an updated review the next time that I do."}
{"text":"We recently visited Yamazura and had the most wonderful experience. The food was great and the service was excellent. Can't wait to go back again!!"}
{"text":"I adore this place - great atmosphere and green tea to start you out. Excellent service with very friendly staff and flawless sushi. I tried the Salmon Crudo summer special instead of the ceviche because it had salmon (my favorite fish) and I was not disappointed. Bright and beautiful flavors, pretty to look at and easy to eat! Went with my favorite nigiri to finish things off - my traditional test of a sushi restaurant - and again everything was perfect and delicious. Surprise hit of the night was the spicy scallop nigiri !"}
{"text":"The hubs and I finally came to check this place out Saturday evening around 7:30 and thanks to rain, there was a very little wait for our table (it is a smaller restaurant). We were seated at the sushi bar, which was awesome, because watching them churn out roll after roll was a delight in itself (and helped me pick my roll). The servers were attentive and informative, but in no way rushed you to order or anything. We started with the pork gyoza, which was light yet flavorful, and the ponzu sauce had a light kick to it. My husband ordered the UFO and spicy salmon roll and I ordered the Rich & Famous and spicy tuna roll. All four of these rolls were delicious and very filling! Each had their own unique flavor profiles and my husband couldn't stop raving about his UFO roll (he's still new to eating sushi). This is definitely a place that we will be back to again and again to get our sushi fix!   Bonus - if there is a wait, they will take your number so you can hop over to Sycamore for a pre-dinner beer."}
{"text":"First of all, if you look through the one star comments, most of them complaint about waiting too long, so if you are in a hurry or hate waiting, maybe this is not for you.   I personally have a lot of time tonight, with a full house the wait for our drinks 10mins and the wait for sushi 30mins not too bad.  Their food is not over priced, they have a large selection of sake and other drinks. sushi is super fresh, definitely will come back"}
{"text":"Yamazura offers exceptional service and excellent, fresh sushi. Their location makes an easy walk from anywhere in South End. From their first week to this week I am consistently pleased with both their service and great food. A must try in the South End Area!"}
{"text":"Just tried his place for the first time with a few friends. The sushi was very well priced and they had a great selection! I can definitely tell it's the same owners as Ru Sans because some of my favorite menu items are also served here (kiss of fire roll, grinch roll).  We started with miso soup and gyoza. The miso soup was small but very good. Some in our party felt that the gyoza lacked flavor. We followed with sushi which was great- I like that they have some health \"no rice\" options on the menu. The sushi was comparable if not better to the sushi at ru sans. We had a minor hiccup with the Tarzan roll (the spicy tuna was left off of the top) and the server quickly remediate the situation and brought us an entire new roll.   Overall I was very impressed. This is a great addition to the south end area with good quality food for the price. The service was excellent- especially for a brand new restaurant! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yummm! Yamazaru has become my go to spot for sushi in Charlotte! They are located in South End (1 minute walk from Sycamore Brewery), so they draw in a younger crowd. There is limited parking and the restaurant is small so they seem to have a difficult time accommodating groups of 6 or more.  The sushi is so good, and in my opinion it's the best value sushi in Charlotte - most rolls are right at $10.00. I also LOVE their fried rice. Our favorite rolls are the West Woods, Dancing with the Stars, and Tarzan. They also have good beer, wine, sake, and cocktail selections.  I've eaten here a handful of times during the week, and each of these times I've been seated immediately and received fast and great service. I've eaten here twice on the weekend, and both times the service has been slow and I've had to wait for a table. It seems they have the weekday dinner rush under control, but on the weekends they seem a little understaffed and overwhelmed. This is the reason I've assigned just 4 stars. Also, on the weekend evenings it is SUPER LOUD in here, so if you're looking for a quiet date night - this isn't your spot on the weekends."}
{"text":"Excellent all around experience- drinks atmosphere most especially the food! We had the Yamazaru, West Woods and Gladiator rolls. All were excellent quality and prepared in timely fashion for a Friday night. Ginger salad dressing was delicious but was served with only lettuce. Their warm saki was delightful and seemed to be bottomless- lol! Great location and ample parking. Super attentive staff and loved the urban steel decor/ atmosphere. Prices were very reasonable for quality and location- def will return!"}
{"text":"Good stuff! First time here. Staff was great, sushi was outstanding. Not crazy about the Mochi ice cream, kinda weird."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, very friendly staff and wonderful food. Highly recommend you try this place. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The quality was great! Our waiter was also awesome. He knew what kind of fish I wanted and was helpful. The pricing was the best part. Less expensive then other places but the sushi was amazing. My new favorite sushi spot!!"}
{"text":"I haven't had sushi this good since I lived in St.  Croix and was eating that day's local catch. It's by far the best I've had since moving back to Charlotte. I would particularly recommend the Kiss of Fire roll--it isn't as spicy as I hoped, but the flavor is amazing. I was trying to cut back on eating out, and then this opened in my neighborhood-- I'm in trouble!"}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. So. Good. We showed up with a party of 14 and they were so kind and accommodating. Gus the bartender made us THE BEST DRINKS EVER. Ask for Gus when you stop in to the bar. I'll absolutely be back."}
{"text":"The sushi was so fresh and delicious. Food came out very fast as well! Nice ambiance.  Drinks were top shelf! I will definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"I'm honestly not complaining, but... how is this place not destroying the Charlotte sushi market? Even with places like O-Ku, Ru Sans, Nikko, and the fabled Helles and Dunkel sushi (oh yea, that's real), I still see so much potential for Yamazaru to lead the pack here.  Saturday evening, about 7:30pm, The Lady and I walked into Yamazaru for our first time, and to our surprise, there were still several tables open and available. The very first thing we noticed, however, is how the two-tops on the patio were filled with people and their dogs. Super good to know. Anyways, we were seated and our server, Phat, came up and greeted us immediately. We ordered a plate of their tiger shrimp appetizer which featured delicious shrimp in a chili sauce, and little rice bowls that you could use to make mini tacos. I'm lucky I even was able to snap a photo before The Lady destroyed them. Together, we ordered 3 sushi rolls, the Angry Spider, a specialty called the Jawbreaker, and the West Woods. Phat told us that the restaurant was unfortunately out of snow crab, the main meat in Jawbreaker, and they were using imitation crab and the price was reduced $3 because of this. The Lady and I agreed that wasn't the best option and ended up choosing New Moon instead, but major props to Phat for even telling us this.  Our wait was long. Probably too long for me to be giving 5 stars, considering the table behind us ordered several things that came out almost immediately, while our 3 rolls took about 45 minutes. But you know why I'm not docking? Because Phat came and checked on us, assured that he was pushing the kitchen, and apologized so many times and said that he would be worried if he were in our positions. I don't know why it took so long, nor do I really care so much. An attentive waiter can make time pass a lot faster.   We see one sushi roll go to the table behind us, and both The Lady and I eye it. Ours should be coming out first. Turns out, the table behind didn't order it, and Phat, as a courtesy, gave that whole roll to us on the house. I don't remember what it was, but it was topped with Tuna and Avacado and the fish was extremely fresh and flavorful. Our three rolls come out, gorgeous presentation. All of the tempura pieces were light and crispy, and not the least bit greasy. We were uber impressed with the price point that came along with it too! 3 rolls + appetizer came out about $42, a fantastic price for sushi for two!  At the end of the night, we knew we'll have to come back. The menu is extensive, but luckily there will always be a table so we can try it all :)"}
{"text":"What a great new addition to micro brewery scene in Southend; because we need to eat good food when we're enjoying a beer or two! This place has a good set up. There is a small patio with high tops beside the dedicated off street parking. The restaurant is a mix of tables and booths. There is a big bar and also a separate Sushi bar. The bar is a full service bar with a great selection of liqueur, beer and wine. The wines are reasonably priced and the selection of wines by the glass is decent. The menu is extensive but luckily we had a great bartender who made recommendations; we tasted a wide selection from the menu and everything was very tasty. The tuna tacos are probably the best in Charlotte; they just them totally right. You could probably spend all night on the appetizers only, but try the sushi!  We were looked after by Gus - a credit to any bar or restaurant!"}
{"text":"Just tried it for the first time since it's only been open a week. Delicious sushi, solid prices, service was pretty good too. I would definitely try this spot for dinner again"}
{"text":"I love sushi and love that there is a new sushi restaurant in my neighborhood.  Once I arrived I was impressed with the decor and design, on the trendy side. They have a few outside tables, multiple tables and a sushi bar. Service was on point, and one of my old waiters, from another sushi joint, is now here so it was nice to see a familiar face! I decided to start with miso soup, as I base sushi restaurants on a few things and miso is one of them.  Let me say, it was great! Served in a covered bowl, was piping hot and not too salty or fake miso tasting. As for the sushi I ordered the sushi and sashimi platter, a good way to gage a sushi restaurant.  The platter came with six pieces of sashimi, four pieces of nigiri and a roll, I chose the spicy tuna.  Everything was great!  A definite spot I will return."}
{"text":"Excellent. Great selection of all facets of Japanese  cuisine and though I am no expert seeming very authentic. The whole squid grilled until black in places with refresh ground ginger is the real deal. The eight piece sashimi cake with very fresh and huge portions of fish. Udon soup very wholesome and tasty. A vast selection of interesting sushi rolls. Yakatori. Forty appetizers. I have been a long time Rusan's fan and applaud them for bringing his cuisine to Charlotte but this place seems to have them beat in quality and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I hate to give away my fav Spots in CLT. However by far best sushi I've had in town. I will be back ! Super fresh fish , and very yummy combinations . The atmosphere was great for date night !"}
{"text":"Food was bomb- diggity - good :) server was friendly and nice! So pleased fresh tasty. Got the rainbow sushi, pork bun-so tasty . Was not disappointed. Crowded for a Tuesday night but that's a good sign that food is on point!"}
{"text":"Yamazaru is a legit sushi-ya and Izakaya. The menu is huge with plenty of options for everyone. Prices are very wallet friendly too, especially on the nigiri and traditional rolls like negitoro. I was super happy to find natto maki (fermented soy bean sushi roll), which is hard to come by in the US since it's usually only Japanese people who like it because of the smell. They also have onigiri which is a Japanese comfort food (basically a triangle of rice with a filling and wrapped in seaweed). In addition I tried the black cod which was very good and a fancy cucumber wrapped roll which was fresh and tasty. Service was efficient and the drinks looked good too (large selection of sake and $8 for cocktails). I would definitely come back when in Charlotte again. I liked this place much better than Futobuta and O-ku sushi, which I also tried in the same week."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sushi spot in Charlotte, NO DOUBT! My boodle and I went last night for a little date night. We had not been to Yamazaru yet, and I'm so glad we tried it. I must admit, I'm not a super adventurous sushi eater, and I ordered the Philly and the Spicy Tuna Roll. Boodle, on the other hand, went ham on his rolls and said they were fabulous.  Anyway, I absolutely LOVED what I got and it was not expensive. I also ordered a Lemon Drop Martini. Our total bill, pre-tip, was $47 and included 4 rolls and and two alcoholic bevs (one being a cocktail); I thought this was a good price compared to what we've paid at other places.  Our service was awesome. Parking here is a breeze. The atmosphere is trendy, warm, and inviting. We will definitely be back ASAP!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was very fresh and extremely tasty. Wife said it was the best miso soup she's ever had. I especially enjoyed the Gladiator roll. Friendly and attentive staff - Recommend !"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed all my food and the atmosphere here. The prices are very good for what you get. My husband and I shared the cheese wontons, lettuce wraps (good but could have been a little more of the chicken mix as we had left over lettuce) and 3 sushi rolls. I can't remember the names of them all but the Dancing eel was delicious. They have some cheaper smaller rolls but I'd go for the specialty rolls as they are good sizes and have more flavor. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great price, best sushi in Charlotte and the people, awesome. I guarantee it, if you don't like it I will eat your sushi, not a problem."}
{"text":"Been here twice, and it keeps getting more enjoyable! This place has a great atmosphere, it's fun for a Friday Night or basic dinner during the week. The sushi is very good. They have a big variety of rolls. But if you are like me and prefer basic sushi pieces they have that too--the basic platter is big and at a good price. The special seared salmon appetizer w/aoli sauce is delicious! The wait staff is very nice. We will definitely be coming here often.  I am anxious to try the ramen as that looked really good."}
{"text":"Been trying to make my way over here since opening, but this place looks like it will be around for a while.  Had an early-ish dinner on a Wednesday evening and we were lucky to get a booth... by the time we finished eating, the place was packed and the bar was full.  Hosts and servers were nice enough, and there are bus-ers that walk around to make sure empty plates get whisked away to the kitchen for clean up.  Wednesday was $4 Draft Night!  So we definitely took advantage.  Ended up splitting Tuna Tacos as the appetizer and ordering a specialty roll AND a Tonkatzu Curry Rice Bowl.  Everything was delicious and... \"yes\" I did finish EVERYTHING.  I was super hungry and left super full.  There's a sushi bar you can sit at... and also a separate \"bar\" bar you can sit at as well.  Someone was eating by themselves with a laptop at the bar so it's pretty casual... I'm sure that would be frowned upon when the night progressed.  There are also outdoor tables (not too many), but a really cool spot... there was japanese TV playing on the one TV I could see from my seat.  Made for some interesting moments when I would glance up and try to figure out what was going on."}
{"text":"We popped in on a Saturday night and we seated ourselves at the sushi bar right away. Definitely trendy as others have posted. Very loud based on how busy it was; bustling with a mixed crowd of college kids to middle aged couples. We sat next to two couples who were living their best lives ordering appetizers and round after round of beers. I want to be a classy middle aged Japanese woman when I grow up asking for kewpie mayo to dip my chicken wings. The Brussels sprouts we saw go by smelled amazing! We shared the calamari app and two of us. Calamari wasn't chewy and the sushi tasted fresh. Plenty of food to share between the two of us. Bill came to about $30 before top. Why the 3 stars? Well, I would say they were ok, I wouldn't hurry back but I wouldn't decline an invitation to come here. The service was quick but did not add anything to the experience. I would say just like Ru San, it's short and fast without any extras. Is it bad I would like to be suggested an item and maybe upsold an extra appetizer?"}
{"text":"Great spot for a date night or casual dinner out! Menu has tons great choices. We went for a few small plate appetizers and some rolls. Everything was priced right and tasty! The green curry mussels were a little salty but I could look past that due to the quality, quantity and overall taste of what we ordered. This is our new sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi for a great price. Good drinks too. They don't take reservations but have a nice size bar and sushi bar too."}
