{"text":"I\"m with Lindsay K. when she says that this place is intolerable during the week when school is in. She's right - there are far too many kids around, which makes it near impossible to get in, get your pizza, and get out. 

However, I have started ordering from Awesome Pizza and I have yet to be disappointed! I actually quite like their pizza - but this is coming from a girl who absolutely LOVES all types of pizza. No, their crust isn't the greatest, and I'm sure the glycemic index is higher than it needs to be, but I LOVE their spinach and feta pizza. SO GOOD. 

While you're not likely to find neither Lindsay K. nor myself in the actual store, you ARE sure to find Awesome Pizza Delivery in my most recent caller list."}
{"text":"My recommendation:  Never go to Awesome Pizza on a weekday when school is in.

I've never been so overwhelmed and crowded by kids as when I went to Awesome Pizza that one afternoon.  From the moment I walked in the door to the second I left with my pizza there were high school kids surrounding me the entire time.  

It was so busy in this place that it took me almost 15 minutes to get my single slice of pizza and leave.  And it was barely worth the wait.  While it was inexpensive pizza, the quality wasn't that great.  That's probably because they have to mas produce them in order to feed the hungry mob of high schoolers that bombard the place every day.

Awesome Pizza scored big when they put a store in this location.  They must make a lot of money from all the kids going to school.  Personally, I probably won't go back to this Awesome Pizza... unless it's the weekend or summertime."}
