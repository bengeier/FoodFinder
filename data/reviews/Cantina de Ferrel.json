{"text":"Worthy of a trip anytime you're within 20 miles or 30 km of Peniche. Pizzas, pasta, specialty dishes all quite good. Moreover the service was superb, attitude really enjoyable will certainly visit again"}
{"text":"I came here late for dinner and didn't make a reservation cause it just looked like a little pizza joint but when I got there it was packed. Luckily they were able to seat us but I would recommend making a reservation. 

We sat down and they brought us bread and olives. We ordered a cappers salad (they had run out of the carpaccio I was looking forward to) and we got a risotto dish, lasagna dish, bolognese dish and 3 different kinds of pizza. This was for 3 people, yes we are all pigs lol. 

The food was great and we finished almost all of it. The pizza's a small enough to be personal size. The restaurant is hidden in a small town called Ferrel near Peniche but if your in the area surfing I'd recommend you go check it out! Only about a 10 minute drive!"}
{"text":"Mit Abstand das beste Essen, was wir in Baleal hatten. Freundliche Bedienung, nette Atmosphäre, gute Auswahl und sehr lecker. 
Man sollte vorher reservieren, bei unserem erstem Besuch mussten wir eine halbe Stunde auf einen Platz warten, dafür gibt es sogar eine schiefertafel-warteliste vor dem Restaurant :D die Leute sind trzdem sehr freundlich und holen einen vom Café gegenüber indem man warten kann ab, um sich die Wartezeit zu verkürzen.

5 Sterne!"}
