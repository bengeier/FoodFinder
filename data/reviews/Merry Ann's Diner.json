{"text":"Better for the fact that it's open 24/7 than the quality of its food. Merry Ann's is definitely a place to recover from a rough night. I just love breakfast."}
{"text":"Perfectly serviceable diner food -- haven't tried the Mexican food yet, though. REALLY nice people working there, too. Great hash browns as well."}
{"text":"It's easily one of the best diners on the planet! The food is great and the service is efficient. It's open 24x7 which is great for my 3am cravings. It's a great spot to be at after unofficial- you'll always have a great story to tell and have some fun times at the diner at that time. They have a jukebox that's seldom used but still nice to have when you're in a great mood. Also, their fries are by far the only ones that I've thought can match up to the McDonald's fries. 

The staff is really really nice! I remember once when it was freezing and I got a hot chocolate with some eggs, and the lady gave me another hot chocolate to go for free just because it was really cold out. 

They also will make you custom things as long as they have the ingredients that you request. I've been to all the locations in the Champaign-Urbana region, and this is probably the best one! It's only ever shut on New Year's eve and Christmas day. The one in downtown on Neil is never shut."}
{"text":"This place is big nasty.  NASTY!  Perkins isn't much better.  Just go to any of the downtown Champaign bars, most of them serve food until pretty late and you won't get food poisoning - big plus!"}
{"text":"I love this place I always come to this one the service is great always nice and funny and more then happy to tip the food is basic dinner food with a not so basic taste fully recommend it for a midnight snack and a good time"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this morning. Excellent service! Our waitress was attentive, kind, and went out of her way to make our experience enjoyable. The food was what you would expect from a diner - big portions, cheap prices. Would definitely recommend Merry Ann's!"}
{"text":"It's a cute diner!! The food is not terribly greasy but isn't 5 star quality but c'mon, it's a diner! It's suppose to be that way. The breakfast burrito is very good. It's huge so I got to take it home which is always nice for a college student. Cheap prices, decent food, what more could one want in a highly populated college town??"}
{"text":"I've lived in CU for 8 years, visited both Merry-Ann's locations at least three times, and never had a decent bite of food. 

Skip it and go to McDonald's."}
{"text":"Looks like a waffle house, smells like a waffle house.. feels like I'm back home in SC! 
He had the diner stack, biscuit on the bottom, eggs scrambled. I had 2 eggs over medium with bacon, hashbrowns, and toast. We were the only customers on a Sunday morning at 1pm until the hungover undergrads rolled in. Service was excellent. Our waitress was very friendly, and our food arrived promptly. It was delicious and didn't leave me with that greasy what did I just put in my stomach feeling that I was expecting (from past WH experiences). I will definitely come back. The only thing that could have made my experience better is a big bowl of cheese grits..."}
{"text":"The Original Merry Ann's...look no further for your search for the proverbial greasy spoon.  

What is it about this diner down by the train tracks?  Is it scarfing down cheese fries on blindingly bright orange decor at 3 in the morning after a night out?  How about when you feel the train shaking the whole place when it passes by a few feet away?  Maybe it's the \"diner stack\" (a blob of eggs, biscuit, sausage, on a bed of hashed browns, then drowned with gravy).  Or its hangover cousin that adds hamburger to the mess?

It's a rarity to find a place like Merry Ann's in Chambana nowadays - best to enjoy it while your stomach can handle it!"}
{"text":"It's a good little diner, and the closest thing you can get to a Waffle House around town.  I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Made the mistake of going at a slow time. I have been there a couple times and had passable food at reasonable prices.  However, at 4 AM, the omelet was served with cold -- refrigerator temperature -- ham inside it; the first cup of coffee was okay; the second cup tasted like it was made with dishwater."}
{"text":"If I may be so bold as to say this, Merry Ann's is a celebration of everything that is good about life.  The only downside is that in this case, too much of a good thing could possibly lead to atherosclerosis or some equally undesirable cholesterol condition.  Who can not honestly say they don't harbor a soft spot for those 24 hour diners, whose men and women work tirelessly throughout the night in order to provide us, the host inebriated, with industrial strength coffee and omelets at two in the morning?

The food at Merry Ann's, if you've never been, is pretty standard for diners.  Breakfast served all day, so you can get pancakes with the folks on Sunday morning, or pancakes at 4:47 in the morning after your friends push you in a shopping cart to the front door of this imperial majesty.  I was originally planning on giving them three stars, but Merry Ann's got an extra star from me for their bacon preparation technique.  Most places hand you burnt, crispy bacon-- Merry Ann's gives you greasy bacon still glistening with fat, fresh off the fryer.  The only way to eat bacon.  The aforementioned pancakes are a tasty deal too.  They're fluffy enough, and the taste can be drown in one of the three fine syrup offerings located at your booth.  Service is fast, friendly, and always ready to fill up your coffee.  And if you're at Merry Ann's, you will probably appreciate that.

So overall, Merry Ann's is cheap, delicious, and convenient.  Located in proximity to the downtown Champaign bars, you will always have a place to sober up for a few hours.  Champaign suffers from a dearth of 24 hour diners in my opinion.  I refuse, out of principle, to go to the Campustown IHOP.  Even if the stories I've heard about the place aren't true, drunk undergrads still sounds pretty terrible to me.  I miss the spots like Denny's and Norm's... but I feel like Merry Ann's does its duty, and does it well.

Keep on keeping on, Merry Ann's Diner."}
{"text":"I came here after an unfulfilling dinner at Big Grove Tavern.  We sat down for some fries and a slice of pie.  Everything was great, the pie was delicious, the fries were hot, and the service was prompt and friendly.  Everything was great, that is, until I start hearing noises behind me.  I assume someone is dragging a chair across the floor.   I don't turn around, because it stopped soon enough.  Time passes and the sound starts up again. My S.O. starts looking a bit uncomfortable. I turn around, and no one is dragging a chair, but there is a man 2 booths away.  It was him.  Farting.  Having a fart-attack.  A super-extended fart-attack.

Having quickly lost my appetite, we asked for the check, left the server a hefty tip, and skedaddled.  

I can't really blame Merry-Ann's for this.  This is a place for everyone, farters included!  So if you want a cheap diner, this is your place, but be aware that this is a big world, and flatulence happens."}
{"text":"A lot of places will claim to be \"old-fashioned diners,\" but Merry Ann's is as close to that description as I have ever seen! Merry Ann's is one of my go-to spots for food around campus, and by far my favorite place for breakfast food. The only down-side is that they are frequently under-staffed, but Debbie and her team are always hustling to make up for it. It is very reasonably priced (it comes with being near a college campus), the food is delicious, and the waitstaff and chefs are extremely hard-working. I highly recommend the ham and cheese omelette, which (I believe) includes a choice of pancakes or toast. Go with the pancakes - they are fluffy and piping hot. Oh, and make sure to compliment your meal with coffee. It will come to you in traditional diner fashion - sliding down the table as the coffee swirls around the edges and ever-so-slightly spills over the sides. I go for the food, but I stay for the diner atmosphere. Consider Merry Ann's!"}
{"text":"Waitress was super unfriendly, and the food is way overpriced for its quality and quantity. Going there for any kind of nostalgic diner environment is not worth it.

Save yourself the trip!"}
{"text":"I was excited when I walked in, because it reminded me of a Waffle House.  I know Waffle House is generally pretty disgusting, but I love it.  Then I looked at the Merry Ann's menu and . . . no waffles!  WTF?"}
{"text":"Very good, very inexpensive food. The atmosphere is fun and welcoming. Except for a few choice expletives from the cook, it was a very pleasant place to eat after a very long day of traveling."}
{"text":"This place is so special. The nostalgic experience of going to a dinner is something that everyone should get to experience! And I would advise to do it several times. This place is more than a restaurant. Its a piece of this towns history. Who knows how many disagreements between coworkers or friends have been settle over good pie and a cup of coffee here? And how many students have enjoyed the dinner stacks at two AM.? And by the way there is nothing wrong with ordering bacon instead of sausage or a hamburger on the stack. They have delicious coffee. They are priced reasonably. And if youre lucky the staff will talk to you! I hope you get to enjoy this place as much as I do."}
{"text":"Very good food and service.
Restaurant is in a excellent location to u of I games... Within walking distance to several shops"}
{"text":"The place is relatively cheap, and a nice break from dorm food if you're a student. It has a very retro diner kind of feel, if you enjoy that kind of thing (there's a counter with spinning stools and a whole lot of booths). Their chocolate milk shakes are fantastic, and I've always had a good experience with anything they have that comes with eggs and hash browns."}
{"text":"After a disaster of a breakfast at IHOP yesterday, I went with a group of seven to Merry Ann's Diner in Urbana for breakfast today. There were only a few groups in the place so seating was not a problem. We were able to order quickly and our food came within a few minutes. Everyone seemed to think their breakfast was okay -- no great raves, but no problems either. Service was excellent. My meal was a Mexican Omelet with hash browns and coffee -- and was good."}
{"text":"The Billy Goat's of Champaign.  'Nuff said, but in case it's not...

Definitely the place I go to after a night of debauchery for that heart-clogging, turn-everything-it-touches-transparent-from-the-grease, orgasm-in-your-mouth goodness.  I mean, they have a \"hangover burger\" for f*ck's sake!

I love breakfast food.  I would eat breakfast food every meal of the day if I didn't mind putting on 20 pounds (trying to go in the opposite direction, actually: new years resolution, you see =\).  Merry-Ann's has AMAZING breakfast food.  Ergo, I love Merry-Ann's!  Everytime I go, I make sure to get The Dinner Stack (everything you could want for breakfast dumped together and then smothered in sausage gravy), or their Super Burger (sometimes with a side of cheese fries even though I know the burger itself fills me up... what can I say?  Thirsty impairs my judgement).

Breakfast isn't all that Merry-Ann's does well; they have all the typical diner food (juicy burgers, grilled sandwiches, cheese fries, milk shakes, etc.) - but better.

Open 24 hours a day with almost most things on the menu only around $5, you'll be able to get that extra drink or two at the bars/club."}
{"text":"I loved the authentic diner experience!   Definitely one of the best places to eat breakfast in all of Champaign- Urbana.  I've had the mushroom and cheese omelet (delicious!) and the french toast (good home cooking comfort food).  I want to go back for lunch sometime soon and see how their burgers rate.  Definite thumbs up for Merry Ann's!"}
{"text":"Came in with my family, ordered a smoothie, got a cup full of ice chunks with some fruity milk. Ordered a mega omelet with no ham, it comes back with ham. Server was very nice about remaking it. It comes back-- ham again!!! Left hungry. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Cute little diner, open when you need it to be open (after the bars close).  The food was pretty cheap in my opinion (burger and fries for $5.15).  And if you order one of the breakfast combos, you can switch regular toast for french toast!  If I hadn't already been set on ordering a burger, I would have been all over that, since french toast is my favorite breakfast food.  And they were quick with the food- like under 10 minutes from the time we ordered to the food being put on the table, and we had 5 people in our group.  And you can see the cooks, and how they handle your food- it's all out in the open.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This little diner in the heart of the U of I campus is a great place for a quick breakfast.  We were lucky enough to find two tables for six on a busy Saturday morning before the football game.  Our server was fast and friendly and our standard breakfast fare was tasty and hot.  Not ideal for large groups since the seating options consist of either 4 top booths or counter stools but a good choice regardless."}
{"text":"Quick and tasty burgers!! Service is always fast and place is always clean.  Even if its crowded there is a quick turnover so no long waiting times.  I stop here whenever im in town at U of I."}
{"text":"Food is good for a classic sit down diner but the customer service was horrible. Waitress took our order after she had taken someone's that showed up 10 minutes after us and we didn't even have drinks until she put in their order and come to us. I watched her not pay attention to some of the other customers trying to get her attention as well. Even though the food was good, can't say I will be returning my business here. The customer service was just that bad."}
{"text":"Walked into Merry-Ann's for breakfast on Saturday.  There was no sign to indicate method of seating.  I stood there while several staff stood idly behind the counter.  They looked me in the eye but never acknowledged my presence.  I waited a bit and then left.  I will NOT return."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience at the Merry Ann's on Neil Street but I thought I'd try this location.  The service was prompt and friendly.  The menu was rather limited.  The coffee was drinkable.  Ordered the Cheese and Mushroom Omelet.  Good portion but the cheese tasted processed and the mushrooms tasted canned.  The hash browns were good and the side of bacon was done to perfection."}
{"text":"I went to Merry-Ann's for the first time on Sunday morning. I was a little bit hungover (oops) and ready for some diner food. Merry-Ann's satisfied all of my breakfast cravings and then some. I had the #1 combo - 2 eggs, hash browns, bacon and toast. I also got a half-order of gravy and a biscuit, plus a coffee. The bacon was by far the most disappointing part of the meal. It was just flavorless and gross. Everything else made up for it, though. My eggs were done perfectly (sunny-side-up), the hash browns were crispy, and the biscuit and gravy was just the right amount of spicy. Two people had a good, filling breakfast for around $14 before tip, which rocks. 
Pros: Everything except the bacon and the awkward time when we had to stand around and wait for a table to open up. Oh, also, I wish they had Heinz ketchup."}
{"text":"I'm going to be completely honest here: the food at Merry Ann's really isn't that great at all... Nothing terrible, just mediocre diner food.

So why four stars? 

- It's dirt cheap. Seriously. They have a fairly long menu and almost every item is under $5. Try to beat that.
- It's open 24/7. Now that's unheard in downtown Champaign, where every other restaurant closes at around 11pm. 

So yeah... the chances are that I'll be back."}
{"text":"Merry-Ann's Diner is a truck stop style 24 hour breakfast diner. Unfortunately, Merry-Ann's is not very good. I can't recommend it.

Merry-Ann's menu, decor and layout, and overall look and feel, are identical to that of a Waffle House franchise. I suspect that this diner was designed to duplicate the successful Waffle House model. 

All of the menu items, from the coffee, eggs, and omelets down to toast and sweet rolls, are poor, although some items are a notch better, namely mediocre. 

Service is roughly comparable to that of other Waffle House stores. Ditto for the decor, and, in fact, the actual floor layout.

Prices are low in absolute terms but they are somewhat high for the types of menu selections offered, quality aside. (And the quality delivered is mostly poor.)

Before the Hilton-Garden Inn took over the property across the street, there was a well-regarded breakfast restaurant, almost a Champaign institution, attached to the property. The Hilton razed the restaurant as part of its renovation. Too bad. The Merry-Ann Diner is not suitable for breakfast at any time of day."}
{"text":"Diner food at its finest!

A UIUC student tradition. Just stick with the breakfast food, it's your best bet"}
{"text":"If you ever go to school at University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana, you must visit a Merry Ann's diner at least once! Especially to try the infamous DINNER STACK:  hash browns topped with cheese, hamburger or sausage patties, two eggs, and then smothered with delicious sausage gravy. (Add a KFC-like biscuit for another 95 cents.)

This is the latest Merry Ann's in the area out of three locations. By me being the first to review it you can tell that not everyone knows about it.  Therefore, it's the cleanest location. Like the other Merry Ann's, it's open 24/7 and I've definitely seen some students write key papers over several cups of coffee.

Prices aren't bad. Lots of food choices. Once finished, pay up at the front register."}
{"text":"I think this was a WAFFLE HOUSE  at one time..
I had a ham n cheddar  omlette. It was very good. Nice to offer French toast instead of regular  toast..
Hubby had the #1 Special..
Neither one of us really liked the hash browns , but he ate them anyway."}
{"text":"This place is great when you're in your early twenties and drunk and it's after midnight. Otherwise, there are a ton of better options in town for the price.

They have diner food that is about on par with Denny's, they're open late, and are within walking distance of the local bar scene. That's about the best I can say for them."}
{"text":"What a travesty that this is the only place to get late night food around downtown Champaign!!! Even when I've stumbled in hammered at 2 am I thought the food sucked... now that's saying something! 

Unfortunately, this is the only place to get some sober-me-up food after a long night of drinking at dt Champaign so I'm going to undoubtedly return at some point. But I do have to say that I will never get that nasty corned beef hash again..."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for the prices are cheap but so is the service, food and the atmosphere of the place. The diner was not busy and we had to hound our waitress down for service. The food is tasteless. The floors were dirty, the tables and booth seats were sticky."}
{"text":"I was in Urbana for a job interview that didn't start until 9 AM, so I decided to grab some breakfast. Being unfamiliar with the area, I wasn't sure where to start. I saw a subway, but I wanted something more, and I got it!

I walked in at about 8 AM, and I was the only one there, along with Alex the cook, and Debbie, my waitress. I am an eggs and 'cakes guy, so that's what I ordered. I had the mega omelette (egg whites and no ham/cheese), with a banana instead of hash browns, and a short stack of pancakes instead of toast.

The omelette was solid. It was nothing great, but it wasn't terrible either. The salsa that I asked for was just okay. I put ketchup on some of my omelette... I love that stuff.

Anyways, my short stack of pancakes were the best part of the meal. They were fluffy and delicious!

Debbie was very fast, even though 6 other parties came in while I was still dining. She was by herself on the floor, and did an excellent job.

It looks, and sounds, like Merry Ann's is known for their late night gluttony items, which is fine. I was looking for something quick and not terrible for you, which is what I got. I wish I would they would have had some green veggies for my omelettte, but oh well.

7.60 for an omelette, fruit, and cakes? AWESOME! I tipped very well to show my appreciation.

I was not aware that there are other locations in the area until driving around later that day. Open 24/7. If I'm in the area for breakfast again, I'll def stop by!"}
{"text":"Arrived in Champaign late on Christmas Eve and the hotel had stopped serving food. We hit the snow-filled road to find some grub...actually I was pining for a piece of pumpkin pie. The Merry-Ann's near our hotel was closed but we spied another one that was open 24 hours.

It was as if I'd walked into a time warp -- the menu, the decor, and the pricing was unusual for this California gal. I was thrilled to get a piece of pie and even happier for the $2 price. There's nothing on a menu for $2 in California, not even a sharing charge!

My partner had a grilled cheese and tomato sandwich with fries. It may have been the processed American cheese slices...but she was hungry. I'm glad I wasn't too hungry because the vegetarian options were quite limited and if I'd stuck to my veganism, I'd be SOL."}
{"text":"Used to always love this place 5 out of 5. But for the past couple months, any time I come in, no matter how slow it is, I have to ask to be served. Anytime I need a waitress, I have to stand up and raise my hand. Tonight, after standing up and begging for a server, she came up to us and rudely said \"do you need waters or what\"....."}
{"text":"really cute diner. very affordable, not on the expensive end at all. friendly staff. absolutely love the atmosphere

will definitely be coming back soon"}
{"text":"Amazing price for so much food! This location and all of its other location are open 24 hours a day every day. And they now have chorizo!!!!!!!!!!!! You can get amazing chorizo sausage with your dish!"}
{"text":"Amazing diner food, but that's it.

It's still a diner, no matter how you cut it.

It's nothing to really make a fuss over, as even the best diner food is still diner food.

The price is reasonable and they're open till all hours of the night.  Making my ridiculous drunken forays into Champaign-Urbana much more comfortable and filling.

I love this place, but it's just a diner.

The atmosphere and look of the place is classic 1950's diner, which is actually pretty awesome.  I seem to always get the really short and rude servers.  The ones that make you feel like you're not supposed to be there.

So, there you have it.  It's great food, poor service, great looking diner, great price.  But, man have my waitresses been bitches."}
{"text":"Greasy but tasty. Don't stray too far from the bathroom by his food doesn't stay with you for very long."}
{"text":"The food is clearly average generic diner fare, but the staff are super friendly.  Especially Maria from Zacatecas.  I go here to practice my Spanish, get a great cup of coffee and pretend I'm in California on occasion.



And don't tell anyone else--but I sometimes get hashbrowns with country gravy, transfats be damned. :)"}
{"text":"Good food, good pancakes, SUPER FAST service.  I was very impressed with that.  Standard diner fare, my hubby liked the biscuits and gravy and didn't complain about being brought to a diner (he's a snob usually).

So overall, a great cheap place to go."}
{"text":"Fuck this place. Got food poisoning from raw meat. Everything tastes like grime. Waitress is rude. There is absolutely no reason to come here considering the number of restaurants nearby. Even if you're drunk off your balls at 3am you're better off going to McDonald's. If you're dying for breakfast food go to Perkins, which is also 24/7 and MUCH better."}
{"text":"Average small-town diner feel in all the good and bad ways. Food tastes pre-cooked or frozen, meny is too large, service is great, and it's breakfast all day."}
{"text":"This place is nostalgic. It's got that classic diner booth setup where the servers pass plates right from the center, and they're both friendly but abrupt like a diner should be.

If the coffee even tried to be good here I'd probably be here more often (they usually always keep it topped off!). But it's consistently the worst coffee in town. You can taste the stale.

Even so, it's a diner. I still go back for friendly people, cheap eggs, the clanking of dishes, and the grease rolling on the edge of the plate."}
{"text":"Dear Merry-Ann's,

Please start serving:
1) Real cream (instead hydrogenated fat/soybean oil)
2) Real maple syrup (You serve breakfast...come on)
2) Real butter (see number 1)

Also: Overpriced."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place probably deserves just one star.  However, I experienced Merry Ann's tonight with a delightful mixture of old and new friends.  Some of my friends were drunk, others were not.  

All I had was a milkshake, which was decent.  One guy ordered some eggs, which looked and tasted like rubber.  The atmosphere is mediocre, with no music and just the buzz of fluorescent lamps.  The seats are hard and uncomfortable.  Despite all this, I enjoyed my time at Merry Ann's today, so I'll give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and we're looking for some place open after 11pm on a Sunday night after the concert.  We ended up sitting at the counter and left without eating after watching the cook throw food around, not use any type of sanitary food handling, and was slamming doors while swearing about everything.   How the health department lets them stay open is beyond me."}
{"text":"Hubby and I started a tradition of eating breakfast at different spots around champaign after church and merry Ann's was next on our list.

The place looks like a dive diner which was to be expected. Get there early because the place gets really crowed quickly. We sat in bar stools area and were waited on right away.  The menu was very large, lots of choices and the prices were not bad at all. Entrees ranged from 5-9 bucks.  Their service is polite, fast,  and the food is cooked very fast. Those points are where the good things about merry diner stops.

Unfortunately the food is just not good.  I have heard many people who reviewed this place say \"You get What You pay for\"  but I don't agree.  Food can be cheap and delicious, this restaurant food literally left nothing to the imagination and was very bland.  Although portion sizes were adequate I would rather pay for smaller sizes and better quality food. :/"}
{"text":"merry ann's will always hold a special place in my heart, as evidenced by my making it my first review.  at the corner of neil and kirby, just on the edge of the illinois campus, it was one of my favorite places back when i went to school there.  you might be thinking, \"really, diner food for one of your favorites?\"  partly.

don't get me wrong - it's not the best food I've ever had.  i mean c'mon man, it's a diner for goodness sake.  but if i'm ever in the mood for diner food, give me merry ann's over ihop any day.  but it's about more than just the food - i'll get to that in a second but first my review.  when i ate here, i really only ordered one of two things: the #1 and the diner stack.  ahh yes...the stack.  two eggs any style, sausage patties or burger, slice of cheese, served on a bed of hash browns, over your choice of biscuits or not, covered in a generous ladling of sausage gravy.

i get mine over-easy, with biscuits, and the hamburger patty (because it felt heartier than the sausage patties and went better with the cheese, plus you get bits of sausage in the gravy anyway.)  top it off with some black pepper and about 10 plops of tabasco, and i'm good to go.

i've seen the stack ordered with over-medium (a solid choice and they make them well here) or scrambled (though i prefer the runny yolk.)  the hash browns are your regular frozen kind, but somehow the cook always gets a good mix of soft and crispy, even under all that gravy.  i prefer the burger, but my wife favors the sausage patties and a side of toast in place of the biscuits because it's less heavy.  but the key to the diner stack is the gravy.  i've never seen them actually make it, but they always seem to have a vat of it readily available.  it looks real thick, but goes down surprisingly smooth.  now i understand the phrase, \"and it's all gravy,\" because it tastes amazing and goes great with however you build your stack.  any way you order it really, it's a thing of breakfast beauty.  i will never stop touting the glory of the diner stack at merry ann's.

if you're not in the mood to miraculously gain two pounds, then i recommend the #1: two eggs, choice of bacon, ham, sausage links or patties, hash browns, and toast.  traditional.  plain.  simple.  delicious.  and you might only gain one pound.

the other reason i hold this place in such high regard?  the memories.  the people, the conversation, the bonding.  all of it.  i was introduced to merry ann's by upperclassmen who used to come here and just talk about stuff.  just you and some friends fitting no more than four to a booth and talking about life, about school, about what lay ahead, and bonding over a stack and a smoke (back when you could smoke in restaurants.)  as a student, you couldn't get to merry ann's unless you had a car (which i didn't) so it meant something to me when i would be invited to join them.  when you're young and a few hundred miles from home and living by yourself for the first time, it was nice to have a place where you can open up or just sit back and enjoy conversation.

i've spent many a good time and never a bad time here.  i enjoyed everything about it.  i liked that it was 24-hours, so you could head over after the bars closed, or in the middle of the afternoon (i've done both, and maybe once or twice during regular breakfast hours.)  i liked the fast and friendly service, which it was for the most part.  i liked that they always asked if we wanted our checks split.  i liked that townies ate here; made from bits of real townie, so you know it's good.  i liked the menus that never changed, except for when they got laminated.  i liked watching the cooks assemble a stack like an artist at work.  i liked sitting on the left side a little more than sitting on the right - don't know why.

i leave you now with a couple of do's and don'ts for merry ann's; some words of wisdom if you will.  do eat here.  do not judge it until you do.  do try the diner stack at least once.  do not box or take it to-go (it won't be the same.)  do make sure at least the driver is sober enough to make the drive here.  do not eat all by your lonesome (invite someone.)  do expect to wait for a table (and if there's no wait then it's all gravy - see what i did there?)  do not go there to study.  do respect the staff and other patrons.  do not overstay and take up a booth if there's a long wait formed.  do tip well.  do not sit in silence.  do engage in good conversation.  do NOT talk about fight club.  and do come back now, ya hear?

so many words for a little diner in central illinois.  i promise future reviews won't go this in-depth or off-tangent, but this was more about paying homage to friends, to this place, and to memories from way back when.  i know to some, it's just a diner.  not me.  yeah it was far.  yeah it was never really clean.  yeah it was just diner food.  but to me it was more than just that.  the time i spent at merry ann's was always...comforting."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here in a long time so decided to have lunch here. Had the Railsplitter and it was bland and tasteless. Cook time was slow for just a hotdog and fries type horseshoe. Very disappointing lunch.  Waitperson was courteous and prompt though. Will probably try the place again sometime in the distant future."}

I forgot to mention, I was the only customer there."}
{"text":"Man, am I glad this location didn't exist when I was in undergrad. It might have saved us some perilous car rides, but I also would've left college an extra dozen pounds heavier or so.

I've already reviewed the original location, and not much is different at this one. It's newer and a bit more well-lit, which could be a bad thing if your eyes are sensitive due to an overindulgence at a mug or wine night, though my first time here my eyelids were so droopy I didn't even notice.

Lots of the same great food here from the stack to the horseshoe burger. I even bought myself a souvenir t-shirt to take home ($12, not too bad). I would avoid the coffee smoothie though as it just looked kind of watery. Also I hear that much of the staff from the original location now work here, which is definitely a plus.

Don't take this place for granted - there used to be a different on-campus location which then disappeared for a few years before this one appeared. Support it!"}

Stack.  Sausage.  Over-easy.  Biscuit.

There have been nights where I go into Merry Ann's and that's all I'd say.  And I'd be a happy man.  Despite being off-campus, this is still the numero uno place to go when you've got that drunken hunger.  The late night staff is great too as long as you're not overly drunk or loud; my friends and I have come in enough that they recognize us, even though some of us have been alumni for a few years now.

As noted above, the stack is their signature item (hash browns, meat, cheese, egg, and gravy), which I recommend with sausage (hamburger is too plain) and a biscuit.  An acceptable alternative is the horseshoe burger (toast, cheese fries, burger).

(Second note: Make sure you go to this location and not the one in downtown Champaign.  The downtown one is too brightly lit, takes longer to get your food since it holds more people, and doesn't have the same staff or service)"}
{"text":"Diner located just next to campus. I keep coming back here because of the location and because of the quick, efficient service. My coffee cup is pretty much never empty when I'm eating here.

I would describe the food as average. I like the hash browns. Usually also get some hotcakes and eggs. Really a standard diner fare that you can get all day."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I was expecting much better, even from a breakfast-all-day diner, because I've raved over similar diners in other review (see: CJ's in Seattle and Izzy & Nat's in Battery Park). However, no. I have no interest in darkening the door of this diner again.

I rate diners based on how they deliver on four menu items: their hash, biscuits and gravy, country fried steak, and pancakes. I wasn't able to try Merry-Ann's hotcakes or their steak, so I'm just rating my experience on the hash and biscuits and gravy.

Merry-Ann's is a cute, Illini-paraphanalia-ed (is that a word?) diner with overly hovering waitresses and bad orange juice. The booths are teeny and sticky, with an assortment of dairy-free creamer and jam stacked haphazardly on one end. Interesting. But ick. Their $3 orange juice is pulp-less, watered down concentrate.

Their hash is AMAZING. It's the reason why I'm giving Merry-Ann's its single star. Crispy yet soft, I could've had platters of this thing. Dripping in ketchup or on its own or mixed with the diner's pepper gravy, oooh the hash is heaven.

Biscuits and gravy. Oh gosh. What went wrong? I appreciate the full-size serving, but the biscuits were soggy and the gravy.... I am a fan of sausage gravy in general (I don't discriminate), and I have no qualms of venturing out into the pepper gravy arena, but gravy in general should be thick and flavorful and not congeal and as awesome as it could be. Merry-Ann's does not know how to make a good gravy. It was flavorless and milky and the only reason I even ate it was because I mixed it with the aforementioned fabulous hash browns.

Sigh. Oh well. Am still on the search for a great breakfast nook in Champaign. Any suggestions?"}
{"text":"Food for the price it is is great. But the customer service is awful.

I ordered lunch take-out and gave 10% tip which is fair, especially since I'm not being waited on. The cashier was an elderly woman and she began lecturing me about how she pays her taxes and demanded more tip... Needless to say I left without ordering.

Another time I went back, but unfortunately it was the same person at the register. She was incredibly hostile and began cursing when I apparently did not tell her my order quickly enough. 
Most of the younger waiters have been perfectly friendly and the food is good for its price, but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"While this diner appears to be nothing special, they serve up some of the best and most craved dishes for breakfast all day.  The service is always excellent and the staff is quite friendly - even if their customers have just managed to fanagle a DD to drive them here after a night in campus town.

For those of you health conscious, perhaps you can have wheat toast?  That's about the only health alternative here.  So settle down in a booth, order the horseshoe or infamous stack and prepare yourself for a guilty pleasure.

My personal favorite is the hangover stack - a bed of hashbrowns, optional biscuit, sausage or hamburger patty, eggs any way you want them, slice of cheese, smothered in artery-clogging country gravy heaven.  It's really the gravy that sets this breakfast delight apart from the rest.  Guaranteed to take the edge off that night of heavy drinking - as if one indulgence weren't enough."}
{"text":"Merry-Ann's Just doesn't do it for me.  I'd just assume walk to Subway or Peking Garden when I'm looking for a cheap lunch."}
{"text":"Wow! Awesome and satisfying breakfast. A classic diner with crazy-fast service, nice staff and tasty food. This isn't Health food; this is pure comfort. I had the Mexican omelette that came with hash browns and toast. The omelette was delicious with a generous portion of chorizo and just enough \"kick\". The hash browns were just the way I like 'em straight off the griddle. My wife had biscuits and gravy and loved it. The service was friendly and light-speed! If you love an old-fashioned diner experience, look no further."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for breakfast food. Went to Merry Ann's which is usually a late night favorite.  Ordered the Mexican omelette with jalapeños   The waitress was very nice & friendly. The omelette was good, nothing special but I wasn't expecting that here.  
All in all just a good meal."}
{"text":"If only I can remember what I order and keep it down. The only time I come here is after too many drinks... but however, I thank thee for being open!"}
{"text":"Finer Diner
Three stars is the highest you can justify for this americana traditional diner (I say that with all the love in the world) if the best Waffle House is 2 Stars this place is an example of cheap hot food off a flat grill. 
Burgers, Flapjacks and Eggs Oh My! 
Come here and be mesmerized by the flat grill skill. 
Foods fine. Staff \"gets it.\"
They caught a couple strikes from the heath department too, but you're not going here for steak tar tar."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years. As diners go it's pretty darn good, especially their excellent cheeseburgers and fries. A lot of the food tastes overly pre-made, however (canned gravies and ready-made? pies are a perfect example). For a diner, it would be nice if more of the stuff was made on-site but I guess that's just the way it goes in this town. For processed diner food, it ain't that bad. Service is always super friendly and the coffee is pretty good, although again, more a-ok than earth-shattering (like in the big cities)."}
{"text":"Well, there's good bad-food and there's bad bad-food -- this is the worst of bad-food.  The lowest quality food possible.  While I like a good greasy spoon diner, this place is just horrible.  Absolutely gross.  Gave them the benefit of the doubt and went twice, but it's a thumbs down from me.  If you're 20 and very drunk at 3 a.m. -- maybe; otherwise, stay away and keep an artery open."}
{"text":"Debbie gave awful service. I came in with a group of people and she was unreasonably rude. She swore, she seemed angry, and she made us feel all unwelcome and uncomfortable. Worst service I have ever gotten from a restaurant."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, traditional diner food. The waitress was Dolly and she was amazing. Everything was prompt and exactly as expected, good value for the dollar."}
{"text":"I'll admit that food-wise, Merry-Ann's certainly isn't worthy of four stars, but for me it's more about nostalgia.  We always used to go to the one on Kirby and Neil back during my U of I days, but now when my husband and I go to C-U we'll occasionally go here for breakfast.  

Their breakfast fare is actually pretty decent and insanely cheap.  Everything else is pretty much meh.  Typical diner fare.  Milkshakes are super yummy, though.

There can often be a wait on the weekends particularly during home football game weekends, but it's never very long at all (and I suspect there's probably a wait at most other places, too).  There's a parking lot adjacent to the building which is convenient--and there's easy access to 74."}
{"text":"Merry-Ann's is one of my Champaign memories. We used to drive to Champaign to visit some of the bars. One occasion, I was taken to Merry-Ann's afterwords. Very busy when the bars closed, but oh so yummy. 

They have a haystack with: hash browns, sausage, gravy, eggs and other stuff I believe. Ad a chocolate milk on the side and it is a drunk boys heaven."}
{"text":"Just a fantastic establishment with friendly people. I have literally never ordered anything outside of the breakfast menu, and don't plan on ever doing so. The corn beef hash is the best in town, and the diner stack will cure you of all current or potential ailments. It's great for before you get black out drunk, great for after you get blackout drunk, and pretty good when getting blackout drunk is not involved at all."}
{"text":"1st off I have not eaten here in over 10 years. I got the fish sandwich Which was 2 frozen fish pattys on a bun and plain fries. I could of ate cheaper at home with the same ingredients. My kids got the #2 breakfast and the grilled cheese sandwich which both of them loved. I give it 2 stars the kids give it 4 stars so we gave it a final score of 3 stars"}
{"text":"Keeping with the theme of a few older reviews below. You can't say all merry-Ann diners are the same because the 1 on neil street sux's compared to this one. This one is cleaner and has a better staff that can actually break Into a smile or 2. Better food, better food and better food."}
{"text":"Although the food here is good and the price are ok, this is listed as a quiet restaurant and when I went in at 5am for breakfast this morning they were blaring gangster rap so loud you could hear it from the street.  And it was non stop throughout my meal.  Not the way I was trying to wake up. I will no be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Ok so get ready y'all because I have a HELL of a lot to say about this particular Merry Ann's and the hostile waitress that likely is the subject of multiple of the other negative posts on here. If I could give a rating that took away the overall number of stars for this location, I would. It actually pains me to give such a review because I've actually had several great memories at this diner, but one of my experiences was so scarring that I feel obliged to share it lest my blood boil over.

Without further ado...I ordered an omelet and a waffle, the subtotal of which would have come out to $11.50, and that's rounding up. Personally, I am a college student who disciplines herself to spend strategically yet I am not normally stingy when it comes to tip, because I recognize that waiters and waitresses should not be taken for granted. They work hard, and I respect that and I ALWAYS say thank you (both verbally and financially). 

I couldn't believe the price I saw on the receipt, which wasn't itemized and thus eliminated all details of the individual items, so I went out of my way to respectfully raise inquiry regarding the subtotal that seemed way too high to be accurate. I had even checked the prices on the menu beforehand, so I was extremely confident in my evaluation. The waitress, elderly and tall, told me it was accurate. That was straight up a fat lie. I find it difficult to believe that the tax would be 1/3 of the subtotal at nearly $5... Upon seeing that I gave less tip than she was hoping for, she asked me if the service was terrible. I did not want to be rude and instigate any further conflict, so I said \"It's okay don't worry\" because she was already extremely rude and crude to me and my friend. Truth is, the service sucked shit. We waited so long to be attended to, I finished my water before ordering and not once was it refilled, I had to ask for a box while paying. There were just too many complaints that I could have rattled off to this woman.

THEN, she stunned me to my core. I have never been treated with such disrespect and contempt in my entire life. She screamed \"That waitress works damn hard, why don't you think about that huh?\" I was so shocked at her screaming at me in the middle of the restaurant that I just stuttered \"I'm sorry\" and my voice trailed off as she screamed again \"SORRY MY ASS!\" My friend and I just stood there, I was about to cry, and I was in shock that this waitress was cussing me out. I understand she did not have the full information and that I could have explained better, but NONE of what happened warranted her to swear at me like I was the scum of the Earth. 

To wrap up, I want to share this post not to discourage any of you from supporting this restaurant, the staff, or the franchise. I am sharing because I am honestly emotionally wounded by this unfortunate experience and have thought about it for hours now after the fact, and I wish it we had both handled it more effectively. I have learned my lesson, but I am positive that she did not reframe her perspective. My hope is that she will realize not to judge others without taking the time to get to know them and write them off as another college student who doesn't give enough tip just because. Thank you for reading this post; hopefully you have a better experience here."}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast!  Eggs so fresh you'd think they had the chickens out back.  C ordered corned beef hash and was delighted to find that they mix in grilled onions.

Highly recommended.  An institution in Champaign."}
{"text":"I've been to Marry-Ann's several times while visiting friends in Champaign.  It's an old school diner in every sense: small booths, you're expected to order your food then get out, mountains of greasy food, and cheap prices.

On football Saturday's (when I go) it's a great place to fill up prior to heading to the stadium.  I've tried a couple of different things, but usually end up with steak and 2 eggs over easy.  Now to be honest, the steak is tough, thin, and overcooked, requiring a healthy dose of A1.  But hey, that's what I expect form a place like this.

As an out of towner, I like to make at least one trip here.  Just take it for what it is; cheap, greasy eats."}
{"text":"Honestly, the food was probably 2-star quality, but I'm giving it 3 because it was late, and we were hungry, and it was open. That said, it was very generic quality breakfast/diner food, and while it satisfied my hunger, it didn't quite hit the spot."}
{"text":"Merry Ann's is a great place to go after a long night of drinking.  Some of my favorite memories are from here: most recently, my friend announced to the entire diner that my fiancee had re-proposed which caused hysteria (but no free items, unfortunately).  The Diner Stack is G-d's most amazing gift to drunk and desperate vegetarians wanting to break free for one night."}
{"text":"I went here as an alternative to IHOP, which I must say I adore, for various and idiosyncratic (read: sentimental) reasons.

The seats face big open windows, so you get a nice view of some traffic going by (as well as a Walgreens and McDonalds) if you're into that -- I am.

The food was pretty standard. My special came with a VERY large portion of hash browns.

Unfortunately, I had to pay quite a bit extra for the same items I typically get with the special over at IHOP -- 2 eggs, bacon, hash browns, and some pancakes.

However, it was worth it to be in a different location with its own ambiance. Feels a bit like you're eating at a diner in a small forgotten town that only has one main road running through it, and the people who stop there don't live there but are just passing through. Or I could be projecting.

The staff when I was there was older and not college-aged kids, if that makes a difference to you."}
{"text":"When you're in Champaign, and you want a quick, cheap breakfast with good service, you come to Merry Anns! I loved coming here all the time in College to do some homework in the morning and get breakfast. The ladies who worked in Urbana side were always very friendly and remembered faces/ orders. At one point they would give me coffee on the house and whip up my order before I even placed it! I know they have 24/7 breakfast, but since I lived in Champaign, I never was apart of the crews who would come in at 3am and much away.

Naturally, when visiting for the summer, I had to go back to Merry Ann's with a few friends and grab hangover brunch. This time, we went to the Merry Ann's on Neil street. The diner on Neil is definitely smaller than the one in Urbana and was much, much more busy/crowded. Still, the waitress was very friendly, and I know I enjoyed my meal! We didn't feel rushed at all to finish, even though the line was out the door and we felt bad if we kept staying around just to talk/ get more coffee. 

Unless you're looking at somewhere like Le Peep to get brunch with your parents, I highly suggest Merry Ann's since it is a staple at U of I."}
{"text":"Classic Diner - great diner food, classic feel....tradition!   A lot of late night college crowd after 12m to 2am and mix of all ages on Sunday mornings.  Grab a Sunday Newspaper and a cup of coffee and order from the menu of \"breakfast classics\" - something for all ages, all YUM!"}

{"text":"Breakfast was quick and efficient. They were pretty busy when we arrived, but service was attentive and our food arrived quickly. 

Pretty basic diner food that's super affordable. The food was decently good, nothing fancy. Overall, a good spot to grab a quick, cheap bite."}
{"text":"The food there was ok. I live very close to it so I go there a lot. There is this one old woman as cashier with glasses, who has such a bad attitude towards customers. She never smiles or communicates with customers in the the way that shows welcome or hospitality. She sometimes doesn't even look at the person she is talking to. And every time I said thank you after paid and got my food, she never replied anything. Instead she just turned and walked away as if I was not there! It is like she was having a bad day EVERY SINGLE TIME. I mean it is she who is providing service. It is the most basic manner to at least pretend/appear to be less rude. Every time I bumped into her, it makes my experience extremely unpleasant. And my friends have experienced the same attitude from her too. All other cashiers/waitress are fine. But this one person really damaged the good impression Merry Ann has left me."}
{"text":"Horrible service, OK stack.  I wish the hash browns were a bit more crispy, but I guess you can't complain when it's $4.50!"}
{"text":"This place was so good. Almost reminded me of the Waffle House back at home. It was clean and the service was so nice. Our waitress kept asking if we would like refills or if there was anything else she could get us. It's always pleasant to find a good greasy American breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"Greasy spoon and all day breakfast served with an attitude. Entertaining hangover crowd. Night staff needs serious motivation.

Service is rather quick but I should have lowered my expectation or read more reviews."}
{"text":"Much cleaner and inviting than the other location. Coffee is kept warm. Can't beat walking downtown. Does a breakfast right bottom line."}
{"text":"Yes. It is a diner/waffle house; it's the least original thing that can be said about it but no less true. Comfortable and relaxed, the perfect place to go when you need to ignore the angels of your better nutritional nature and just pig out on things slathered in gravy.
If I were in college, lived in Champaign, and needed a late night place to haunt, this would be it."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  The service was great and very friendly.  We went for early dinner and had cheeseburger, fries, shakes, and biscuits and gravy.  Everything was really tasty, although diner-y, so you know it's probably not the best thing to eat every day.  Very well-priced (under $20 for all this good stuff) and close to campus.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"What more to expect for a diner--great food and a relaxed ambiance. I can sit there for two hours with my buddies and have some coffee after our bar hopping night, or  I can scarf-down some delicious breakfast. An old-school diner that is exactly where it should."}
{"text":"The definition of three stars. 


Fine, ok, decent diner food. Maybe an extra star for being open 24 hours. Kinda slow but not excessively. Generally nice staff. Definitely a nostalgia/convenience kind of place. If you're up late and hungry or don't want to wait in line at Pancake House/Le Peep, you can come here and be somewhat satisfied. 

Egg dishes, burgers, grilled cheese, diner stuff. If you live in the Midwest, you've been somewhere similar, I'm sure."}
{"text":"It is located right by the campus. Food is tasty. I really like Harvest Burger and Hash Browns. Best part about this place: cheerful staff anytime I go there to eat.

Great choice for a late night or early morning meal."}
{"text":"Good old-fashioned American diner.  The service was a lot friendlier than \"kiss my grits\" level, so kudos for that, but the kitchen had a hard time handling my request to put out my short stack a little while after my main meal.  I ended up waiting ten more minutes after we had finished our other food.

They have some great cheap specials here, but I went with steak and eggs for $9.  One friend got the \"mega omlet\" [sic] for $7 which was pretty tasty.  The food was mostly plain and bland; I mean, it's hard to screw up scrambled eggs and hash browns, but it just wasn't that great.  Even the toast was more flavorless than regular toast (how is that even possible?).  But the pancakes were delicious--fluffy and wonderful.  The orange juice was terrible.  We saw the waitress mixing up a big jug of it from concentrate and water out of the soda machine.  It was room temperature when she served it.  Yuck.  

Good times, though.  It's a diner.  Word of warning to you U of I students--there is a one-hour table maximum from 9-3 (that's a.m. AND p.m.)."}
{"text":"We went around 1 am.  It was pretty well filled in there.  We got a table right away and service came and was very nice.  I ended up splitting a diner stack which is hash brown, eggs, biscuit, and choice of sausage or hamburger.  I got the eggs over easy and sausage.  It was really good!  It was smothered in gravy and was a bit over peppered but it really added to the taste and did not overpower it at all.   This is one of the most expensive at 8.25 ish.  But well worth it.  The rest of the food is in the 6 ish range.

My other friends were happy with their fries, chili, and root beer float.  The chili was salty but that could have been the crackers that were put into it, I didn't try it myself.

I must say, I have NEVER had service this fast.  We got water right away, the food was on the table 2-3 minutes after we ordered.  She kept making sure we were good on water and clearing plates.  She was VERY Nice, never made us feel hurried.  I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Decent food, horrible service. 
My friend and I went here on a Saturday morning. It was pretty busy but we were able to seat ourselves and find a table. The menu looked like normal diner food and I ordered the mega omelet with two pieces of wheat toast and my friend ordered a waffle with 2 scrambled eggs on the side. The food came out pretty quickly but my toast was not even toasted but instead just warm and soggy from the amount of butter they put on it. After cutting into my omelet it oozed with grease and I think they were using slices of American cheese inside?? Despite the grease and cheese it wasn't the worst omelet I've had and it was stuffed nicely with veggies and meat. The hashbrowns were also decent. My friend said she enjoyed her waffle but when her \"scrambled eggs\" came out it appeared to be a flat not fluffy mini omelet with nothing inside.. Definitely not anything close to \"scrambled\". 
After we finished our meal we walked up to the counter to pay and there was a long line that didn't appear to be moving. After a couple minutes of investigating for myself, I realized that the credit card machine system had crashed. The girl working at the counter didn't feel the need to let the long line of customers know what was going on. After 20 minutes and missing our bus, she started just writing down the credit card information of customers and saying she would charge us later?? After the person in front of me she said \" if anyone can pay with cash please do that so I don't have to enter these all in later\" with an extremely rude tone. When it was my turn, she took my card and had the nerve to ask me to leave a tip. I left a 2 dollar tip and left. Definitely not a great last impression. 
This place is probably amazing when you're drunk with the amount of grease and poor customer service you'll get. But it's cheap and just don't get your expectations too high."}
{"text":"I'm generally not picky, but Merry-Ann's has become a disappointment for me.  You might say \"well, it's just diner food,\" but even for that it's kinda expensive.  If you stick to biscuits and gravy you're pretty safe, and their fries and hash browns aren't bad.  However, everything is a couple bucks more than I would like to be paying for greasy diner food.

I think the final straw with me was when I ordered a chicken tender plate only to receive chicken nuggets that definitely came out of the freezer: uniform inside texture, only vaguely reminiscent of chicken.  I'm pretty picky about mechanically separated chicken.  Maybe that's snooty, but I just hate it.  In any case, for how much I paid I expected something a little better than that.

For late night food, you're better off making it yourself or even going to Steak 'n Shake."}
{"text":"I feel bad for giving this place only 3-stars because it so beloved by U if I students. Perks are that it's open 24-hours, but I really wouldn't go unless you're drunk or hungover.  The milkshakes are thin and had ice pieces in them and the fries aren't anything special. The corned beef hash is pretty good."}
{"text":"Drunk food at its finest! You can't go wrong with breakfast food and drunken folks. It's easier to go here and get grub than drunkenly go home and try and cook. The service is solid, quick, and the food is affordable.  HOWEVER, I've never been sober, because I'm afraid that my view of the joint well go south."}
{"text":"This was our first trip to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and we ran across Merry Ann's. There are a number of these franchises on campus and they are very nice for a quick bite to eat...especially if you are in the mood for breakfast. Breakfast is served all day and is made to order. If you are not in the mood for breakfast...you are in luck. Merry Ann's is a diner in every sense of the term...good food, expansive menu, everything served fresh, and all day long. Our food came out hot and ready...we were very pleased with the breakfast food. Breakfast has all the usuals...and that is a good thing. Give Merry Ann's a try."}

{"text":"Arrived on a Thursday night, group of four friends. Ordered 2 burgers and 2 diner stacks. Waitress [long curly hair, long nails, heavy set] comes up 25 minutes later says she forgot to put in our order. Apologizes, says our order will be the next one made and retakes our order. This time I change my order to 2 eggs and hash browns with wheat toast, my friends order the same thing. I was hungry so I figure mine would come out the quickest. After a period of time, We see other people's food getting made whatever. The waitress Comes back 20ish minutes later and asks us what are we going to do. She says and I quote \"are you going to just leave, cause I don't want her(the chef) to make your food for no reason.\" Not understanding where this was coming from we say no we  want our food we will stay (I mean we ordered it). ~5 minutes later, the 2 burgers and the diner stack comes out but not my 2 eggs. Waitress says they are just waiting on the toast coming right up. ~15 minutes later, my friends are done eating and I never received my food. Waitress was just making excuses for the mistakes she was making , staff needs to be retrained. In the end, my food order was never even given to the chef."}
{"text":"The food and service are great during the morning, average throughout the day, and absolutely awful during the night. We came here around midnight (all of us completely sober) and ended up having to wait almost 15 minutes just to be acknowledged by the overweight waitress with one of the worst attitudes we've ever encountered. After another considerable wait for our food, and another considerable wait for our bill, we were thoroughly dissatisfied with the waitress who seemed to be doing absolutely nothing while we waited. Finally, we pay and leave, but as we are walking across the street, we hear the door open and that very waitress scream at us across the street, \"Are you f*cking serious!? You tipped me 36 cents?\" Admittedly it is kind of a dick move to tip anyone in change, but I have never met any waiter/waitress with the audacity to yell at me for it. This was by far my worst experience at this place, but I'll be back in the day when the waitresses aren't overweight goths with a bad attitude."}

{"text":"More of a 3.5 stars.  My friend and I stopped in here for breakfast.  We were unsure if is located on campus and just off campus.  It is open 24 hours and was not really busy.  We had planned to go to another location near my rental car drop off but their was no parking.  We ended up at this location.  Service was qucik and efficeint.  Food was pretty good and of decent proportions.  I did not experience any probles with my service, unlike other other reviews have mentioned.  Overall, it was pretty good.  It is nice to know it is open 24 hours as some times I like to eat super late at night."}

hashbrowns, two eggs, sausage patty, and gravy....all on top of each other. I also got a biscuit to go with it. I am pretty sure this might be one of the worst possible things to eat health wise, but damn was it good!!! I dont think I had lunch that day since it was such a huge meal and great hangover cure. 

The line can get long at this place for breakfast, but it moves pretty quick and it worth the wait IMO. Service is your typical diner service so not bad."}
{"text":"The worst place I have went into in a long time.  I ended up walking out after seeing the cook throwing egg shells and having a temper tantrum for some reason.  

Dirty, nasty, hole in the wall.  And I literally skated my way to the bathroom on the slippery floors."}
{"text":"Merry Ann's is a great place, a true down home American diner.  They have great breakfast food, which is all I've ever had there.  You can sit as long as you want, the waitresses keep bringing you refills, and there is a good mix of locals and students.  My boyfriend and I used to always go here to study, or for late night munchies.  I definitely recommend it.  It's not the cleanest, or healthy by any means, but if you're looking for a good American diner, this place is it!"}
{"text":"The stack after 1am is the only thing I ever really came here for.  But it sticks out in my memory.  Ah the goodness.  I also went to the other newer location in downtown Champaign.  But its almost too new and clean to enjoy properly.  This place is dingy and small, but it gives it character.  At either rate, if you in town and awake late at night stop by and order the stack.  You'll be amazed you ate it.  And more amazed you loved it."}
{"text":"I was curious to try this place from the reviews and from what I saw in the pictures so I ordered take out. I am a big breakfast guy and I heard about the diner stack. It was everything I wanted with hashbrowns stacked with sausage, eggs, an optional biscuit, and a slathering of sausage gravy. I also ordered the short stack of pancakes and it was delicious; it reminded me of IHOP's pancakes. Overall, this local diner was a great choice and the wait time was short and food was great. My only complaint is that there is limited parking because it's on a corner; but other than that everything was great."}
{"text":"Found this spot in Champaign. I'm a old diner freak so this was right up my alley.  Been there many yrs, cook was talkative and gave me the history of the place.  Had a Patty Melt w hash browns and a garden salad. Everything was tasty and good. Would definitely recommend to all Diner Lover's.  Great Hash Browns!"}
{"text":"So let me start by saying I love this place...after a night of drinking downtown this is the place to be. Generally there is a lovely gentleman here taking care of everyone...he is so thoughtful and caring it makes me wonder why I feel so jaded in the restaurant industry. Tonight on the other hand has been a different experience all together. This is the first Monday night I've ever been here and even the atmosphere is different. Every time I come here I play music on the \"Touchtunes\" jukebox...tonight tho...I bought $20 worth of credit on the jukebox and knowing that we were going to be here for a while I played a significant amount of music, at my expense, on the jukebox. About 2 minutes into the second song I play I hear the waitress, who I have never seen before, starts speaking poorly of the music selection to other diners...very loudly and completely conspicuously thinking that who ever played the music had already left...completely rude. The wonderful cook, a very polite young lady, was the star of the night making sure our coffee stayed full and thoroughly apologized for what happened. Don't get me wrong, I will be back, I just hope I don't have to put up with the overly judgmental opinion of a late night server who clearly wants to listen to the phone playing music in her pocket more than the tipping guest playing music on the jukebox."}
{"text":"The Merry-Ann's at Neil and Kirby is a standby.  I use to live near there and my neighbor and I would go there every Sunday morning.  The regular waitress was awesome and knew what we wanted.  It is the typical greasy spoon and I love it for that.  Got the t-shirt.  I've moved and have yet to find that certain place that gives me the warm fuzzy feeling that a omelette or diner's stack from Merry-Ann's can provide.  Forget your calorie-counting conscience at the door.

I think the one downtown is okay, but because I heart the original so much, the dt one will never compare."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. The food isn't anything special. The price is a little high for the food you get. The ambient, well it's a diner. Somehow, my friends seem to love it. I feel like I only go here either after the bars or in the morning after a night out at the bars."}
{"text":"I can't help but feel that the foodies who love this place only do so with a kind of hipster irony.  

When ordering at Merry-Ann's, \"Occam's razor\" applies: go with the simple choices.  See a particular dish on the menu that you'd consider ordering?  First, imagine yourself cooking it at home...now count all of the potential steps where poor decision-making or lack of skill could result in disaster.  Choose the dish where there is little room for error and you're set.

On my first, misguided visit to Merry-Ann's, my youthful enthusiasm (and naivete) led me to order the Mexican omelet.  What was I expecting?  Maybe an egg-licious concoction with chorizo and peppers.  Instead I got something akin to a burrito with scoops of taco meat, where the thin skin of egg acted as a wrap.  I openly and unashamedly admit that I am a snob in this regard--due to early childhood trauma involving Taco Bell, I simply refuse to consume oily ground beef cooked with packets of \"Mexican-flavored\" seasonings.  The meal didn't make it far past \"Go\" before it had to take a few steps back...  Err.

With that experience behind me, I still gladly stop by Merry-Ann's, but now I stick with those simple dishes, like eggs, breakfast meat, and hash browns.  All the breakfast combination plates are pretty reasonably priced and the serving sizes are more than adequate.  I don't recommend the dinner items (remember Occam's razor?).

The overall ambiance of the place is above average.  Compared to campus-town's IHOP, Merry-Ann's is bright and clean.  The kitchen isn't in a separate room, which allows you to observe that a good deal of the food items are microwaved.  Maybe those people who have food industry experience wouldn't be surprised or bothered, but most places aren't quite so brazen about the nature of food preparation.

For standard breakfasts, Merry-Ann's is a solid choice, especially as it's the only real 24-hour game in town and within easy walking distance of all the downtown bars.  Still, I'd recommend keeping your expectations low."}
{"text":"Went there once. very basic, taste is normal. Reminds me of waffle house"}
{"text":"If I could give the server here a rating, it would be the that of a negative one. Went here with my friends as a late night snack and ordered a total of one fry, an omelette, and French toast. After waiting an hour we were getting ready to ask if our food was coming. When the table of 7 that came in after us had received their food we got up to leave. When the waitress whom seemed crabby as it as asked where we going we responded that we had been waiting well over an hour for 3 items and we were tired at that point she decided to tell us to \"get out and go cry\". Good late night spot for food however HORRIBLE employees"}
{"text":"Merry Ann's Diner is pretty chill. I'm not mad at it. There's honestly nothing much left to say about the diner. A lax joint to just hang around and converse in conversation with random people and enjoy a cup of coffee. The atmosphere is casual and friendly, and the staff is down to earth as well. The food was decent and generously portioned, but can easily be made at home. Overall rating: eh."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much but it was perfectly suited for our needs. Rolling through the area at 9:00 pm doesn't give much option for food but this place hit the spot. The service was great and the food was better then expected. Bless this 24 hr food joint."}
{"text":"A perfect old school, 24 hour diner.  Comfy booth, friendly waitress, and just the right amount of grease to make you happy after a late night.

We got there about 8am on a Sunday and it was mid-level busy but by the team me we left it was packed"}
{"text":"Merry-Anns is best in the wee hours of the night, (or morning) when your judgement is down and a huge greasy plate of fries, a burger, and milkshake no longer sounds like a bad idea.  Or just when it's 11PM and you decide you need an omelet and pancakes.  Or when you are out on the town and simply no where else is left open to feed your poor, wandering, hungry soul.   It's 24/7 diners like this, that while never your first pick when deciding where to eat, you realize are vitally important to life when the above conditions arise. 

The food is super greasy, comes out super quick, and costs the right price.  The food tastes good, but really people, most things that are greasy are going to taste delicious.  You definitely get enough for the price you pay as well.  

Service is hit or miss.  The restaurant is set up so you can actually grab your own extra silverware, condiments, or napkins if needed.  Despite the closeness of the waitress, she pretty much takes your order, brings food and drinks, and then throws your check on the table and that's the end of that.  You don't go here for the service though.  It is midnight on a Tuesday night and you want scrambled eggs and waffles damnit."}
{"text":"Props to being an on campus, all night diner. Where else are you gonna go for late night pancakes? Food is decent diner quality,  prices are a bit high. Went once with a co-worker who ordered the BLT. When it arrived, there were no tomatoes. When he said, \"This BLT is missing the T\", they looked at him like he was some kind of bug. But he did get his tomatoes. Not too many good breakfast places in this town, so going here is a decent choice."}
{"text":"You'll find a diverse array of people dining here. This Merry Ann's isn't nearly as pretty as its newer sister location, but the food is the same. Sometimes you'll see students studying here.

It's a 24 hour place, and there's one of those \"use the claw to grab a stuffed animal\" machines in the back if you're interested."}
{"text":"The second Merry Ann's. It gets crowded here when drunken people come out of downtown Champaign's bars, but outside of that it's easy to grab a seat. I think I'm addicted to the cheeseburgers here. Also, the place is 24 hours."}
{"text":"We came in the morning after Unofficial for a hearty breakfast.

There were a lot of people there at about noon on a Saturday morning, we waited for 5 minutes before we squeezed 5 people into a booth, plus an extra chair.

I started with a coffee. The coffee here is standard diner coffee.

Most of us had some kind of breakfast item. I can only comment on the waffle and the patty melt. The waffle wasn't bad, but didn't taste like anything spectacular either. I opted to get blueberries on it for a $1 upcharge, which was worth it. It was fruity, sweet and satisfied my breakfast craving. I also finished a friend's patty melt and fries. This wasn't bad either but again, nothing special. 

The service was fine. It's nice that they split the checks up by person so we can all pay individually.

Overall the quality of the food is not the best, but the cost is very low and the portion size good. If you're looking for local, cheap fill, Merry Ann's is a good option."}
{"text":"I would normally rate this 3 stars, but considering my behavior the last couple times here, I suppose I owe them at least an extra star in asshole tax. An average diner with good service (by this I mean they dont kick people out who clearly need to be put to bed). I suggest the Diner Stack with Lipitor for dessert."}
{"text":"Service is great. Food is average for a diner. Coffee is poor. The scrambled eggs are surprisingly bad- do they use real eggs or Sysco refrigerated liquid egg product? Next time I go, I'll be watching. Or hammered."}
{"text":"The workers here have grown jaded from having to deal with university students on a daily basis. We sat a a dirty table for awhile before someone came in and finally cleaned it. I ended up getting a breakfast burrito which was fairly average. It's a place to go if you don't care about lazy service and want average diner food."}
{"text":"This is a great place for late night food, but it's your stereotypical diner fare. I'd recommend the breakfast burrito. It was pretty sad seeing some worker sitting down on the floor behind the counter just texting on his phone the whole entire time."}
{"text":"Only tried breakfast here; extremely convenient when the conference dorm food palls.

Had a basic breakfast combo with scrambled eggs (easily identified as actual scrambled, not made from egg goop), sausage patties that were not too greasy, and for no extra charge the toast was French toast, which was a great idea and the best food on the plate."}
{"text":"Good greasy spoon diner.  I enjoyed their country fried steak.  This is actually one of the better breakfast places in C-U."}
{"text":"Exactly what you'd expect from a greasy little breakfast joint. Cheap, good, reliable breakfast food. I can't speak to their other meals as I basically only come here for breakfast. 

The breakfasts are always fast, tasty, and cheap. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"We used to eat here all of the time - but since last summer, it has gone downhill so much! We went in yesterday for pancakes, bacon and a drink, and it was $15 with tip! The front door had greasy finger/hand-prints ALL over it. When I pointed it out to the waitress, she just shrugged. So disappointed in the whole experience."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I haven't written a review for this place! Often my last stop on the Long Night Out Express, this particular location (there's also one on campus and Neil St) is my favorite. Their complete acceptance as a drunken hub for the genius and moron alike is admirable. I can always find a table here, sometimes a stool, without the danger that IHOP used to threaten, and be plied with a steady stream of eggs, wheat toast, and bacon while I rethink that third whiskey I ingested not long ago. Lighting is exceptional so you may want to avoid this place after a sweaty night dancing but it's good, solid breakfast food at cheap prices ($6 for pancakes, eggs, hash browns, and bacon). 

Thank you Merry Ann's for existing in a world of late night cravings and endless shenanigans."}
{"text":"Pancakes were very salty, bacon was raw and they wouldn't discount our meal!  Even though the manager said she would discount the meal, it never happened even after we reminded them. We will not go back!"}
{"text":"Grabbed burger from here like once, and it was acceptable but never felt compelled to go back since there are great bars and whatnot around the area to go to instead."}
{"text":"Flame food. Definitely the best spot off breakfast on campus hands down and arguably the best place to eat from 2-10 am 

Waitresses are always quick and friendly and food always comes out promptly and delicious."}
{"text":"Just okay food. I can make better food at home for cheaper."}
{"text":"Just okay food. I can make better food at home for cheaper."}
{"text":"Super awesome food that's totally affordable. They're open 24 hours & with 3 locations... totally see why. It has been awesome finding y'all & great to find something like this with the move from New Orleans to Champaign."}
{"text":"If you like greasy, unhealthy, but wonderful tasting food, this place is like coming home. I have frequented the diner during grad school and liked the fact that they are open 24/7. Budget friendly too!"}
{"text":"The stacker plates are a beast! Screw all the haters, this place has feed countless hungover and drunk bodies that went through it and has fueled the UIUC machine during its drunken escapades. Great dive, fat food, just like momma prescribed."}
{"text":"Been here a few times so far and the shakes are delicious and thick, reasonably priced too. Friendly service. I've had the burgers, breakfast food, shakes, and smoothies. Everything is good, shakes are a great deal since they're huge and thick. Other food options are relatively small portions."}
{"text":"Garish lighting, hard plastic seats, and mediocre diner fare.  On the other hand, open 24/7, fast service, cheap, and very very tolerant of loud, obnoxious, uncooperative, and drunken clientele (which, admittedly, my friends and I were last Friday.  Correction: my friends were; I, as DD, unfortunately (?) was not).  Final assessment: Excellent place to sober up (or not) after a prolonged night of drunken debauchery in downtown Champaign.  Probably wouldn't go there otherwise, because being the lone sober one at an otherwise mediocre diner sucks =P"}
{"text":"I first went to Merry Ann's the night I craved The Home Stretch Haystack. Merry Ann's version paled in comparison. I gave them another shot a few weeks later, this time for lunch.  I ordered a blue plate special, country fried steak, mashed potatoes and gravy, and peas. The country fried steak patty was chopped formed, deep fried, and covered with a gravy dry mix, which also covered the potatoes. The peas were from a can. Haven't eaten there since."}
{"text":"I've been here more times than I can count ranging from 6am before finals when I studied over breakfast to 3am pie after leaving a show at canopy.  Maryannes always comes through.  It's a 'greasy spoon' diner so don't expect anything fancy but the prices are so cheap you can't beat it.  They're always serving breakfast and have some lunch/dinner items as well.  Waitresses are always great.  Sunday mornings are really busy and there are no tables that seat more than 4 people so keep that in mind"}
{"text":"Well, this is more of a 2am type place but heck why not try it at 5pm!  Well we were the only people in the place but!  I ordered a Veggie Burger that was just delightful for a dinner!  

It was a huge patty pouring out of the bun!  Threw some Ketchup on it and was completely satisfied for the evening a head of me!  I bet this would have tasted even better at 2 am after some drinks!  

This place is open 24 hours a day and is set up perfectly like an old dinner from the 50's or 60's! 

The staff was very polite and took very good care of us!  Like I said we were the only ones in there but they could have ignored our empty glasses of water but they did not!  They treated us like Dinner KINGS!  Probably the cheapest place to eat in downtown Champaign for sure and it was great!"}
{"text":"Awesome little throw back in time. Breakfast was great and prices are extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"This was the first diner that I've been to but I was not impressed at all. The food was just okay, nothing to rave about. You can find your regular grease-laden favorites here. As far as specialties go, I'd say, the diner stack? If you're looking for a fast track to a heart attack after a game at the Assembly Hall, look no further."}
{"text":"I'm drunk, I'm hungry, I'm in a hurry... LET'S GO TO MERRY-ANN's!!!
whooo hoo!!!
The lady and I stopped by Merry-Ann's on friday. I'm not sure what time it was, we had sort of been at a couple of places, I remember being at Radio Maria (had the fried artichoke, it was delicious); I think we then went to derailled. I hit the devil boxes, put $60 in, took out over $300 whoo hoo. I kind of recall going to quality... then it gets kind of fuzzy. I do remember \"let's go to merry-ann's\" I don't think I would ever say no to that suggestion. 
I don't remember what she ordered, but I'm pretty sure there were pancakes involved. I got what i always get, steak and eggs. 2 eggs over easy, steak medium rare, hashbrowns and wet white toast. How wet, i want it friggin soggy! On friday, the toast was limp it was so soggy. It was amazing. 
One time, I was so hungry, that I got 2 of that order. Do you want that to go? NO, GIMME BACK MY FORK! I considered doing that again on friday, but didn't. 
We then went to the City Center (more like the country center... amirite) for my son's birthday. 
Great, now i want Merry-Ann's for lunch."}
{"text":"Wonderful food choices, great prices, welcoming staff. I love this place. It will forever be in one of my favorite memories!"}
{"text":"Awesome traditional diner. Great breakfast anytime. Love the diner crew as well. A thousand times better than BIG GROVE and 1/3 of the price. 
Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Going to a diner at 2:30AM is always a risk. Most places are overrun with drunken a**holes that think they are automatically VIP because they own the local skating rink. 

This is a place that is smack dab in the middle of downtown Champaign, IL. The staff is great. The food is great. Our cooks name was Robert Johnson. He seemed so professional and fine-tuned in his position. 

This place is great because you are able to watch your food being made and are able to anticipate it's delicious arrival. 

Do yourself a favor and drink a lot of delicious alcohol so that you have an excellent excuse to treat your stomach to their greasy delicious fare."}
{"text":"Restaurant review
I so wanted to like this place, but the food just falls below par. I would have to say that the wait staff is top notch. Very attentive friendly and helpful! This is a classic nostalgic diner where the server comes right to the side of your table to take your order. The menu itself is quite limited to basic breakfast items such as eggs, hash browns, sausage, burgers, sandwiches, and salad. I went with the house specialty dish the diner stack that has (hash Browns topped with cheese, hamburger or sausage patties, two eggs, and then smothered with delicious sausage gravy) I missed the part of the menu where it said smothered... The dish had so much gravy on it that you could not make out the food underneath. The hashbrown were oily, no real crispy to it. The sausage and eggs were good without complaint. Overall with the oil and salt, it was somewhat difficult to eat. I think if they changed some of the options to other more contemporary diner foods they maybe better off. I had high expectations, but the food just as other reviewers wrote falls flat.

Pros: friendly service, clean

Cons: the food really is below par, salty and very greasy not in a good diner kind of way

{"text":"Merry-Ann's Diner is the definition of mediocrity when it comes to diners. Unfortunately, Champaign has a lack of diners and 24 hour restaurants.  I usually get the Diner Stack or the Hangover Stack if I go in past midnight. Both are pretty average with the sausage gravy masking the rubbery taste of the hamburger and the hashbrowns tending to be the best part of the meal. I don't necessarily think that Merry-Ann's is bad, but there are better breakfast places (Sammie's Pancake House in Champaign is much better/cheaper in my opinion) and late night places (almost anything on Green Street). It's definitely better than the IHOP on Green Street, which is terrible in every conceivable manner."}
{"text":"Pretty plain and bad. Not a lot of options at 2am but I would recommend getting a microwaveable burrito from Seven Eleven before stopping at this place."}
{"text":"I have some pretty fond memories of this place, since this is where we USED to go before the new one was put downtown. This is a total drunk-food/hangover spot for sure. The food is by no means phenomenal, and the method of just walking in, seating yourself, and being casual about it definitely doesn't appeal to some people. But being that it's 24 hours (and there are few of those places in Champaign) this will always be a favorite of mine."}
