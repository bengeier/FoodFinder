{"text":"Pranksters Too, where to begin. Been attending with friends for 20 years. Last Saturday noticed the bar was warm and there where portable swamp coolers with what was suppose to be A/C. You can't mix the two defeats the whole issue of cooling. After two pitchers of beer ordered a pizza and was told the pizza oven was broken. Two weeks before they where out of Pizza dough at 7 pm. Always some sort of excuse for the owners who make no  attempt  to fix anything, lets see if the Health department can't make that happen. I was glad to see the Volleyball courts where going in 115 degrees. Ordered sliders which where usually awesome, This time they had freezer burn taste and not cooked through. The draft beer could definitely stand to be colder 34 degrees is acceptable in AZ. Servers are always great think perhaps it is a Management ownership lack of concern that the health department being on there tail end might teach them to give a damn. Henry Becker"}
{"text":"Liked the food but the service leaves a bit to be desired. Tough to get your server back for a second drink. Mottzerella sticks were great and nachos were big and tasty."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended so thought I would give it a try. Pretty typical for a dive bar..clean enough or maybe because its so dark you cant tell. Good size bathrooms. Friendly staff. Pizza was good..fresh with generous toppings. Went there sunday for open mic. If you're a musician looking for an audience of your own, dont bother. Good local band hosts and makes you pay for requests that are only beatles and says its for charity, which it might be. Im ok if they just want to promote themselves but unless you play their classic rock hits, stay seated. Not likely to go back but just because I wasted time with false advertising of open mic. Will say the place seemed safe for a dive bar."}
{"text":"They took our order quickly, but it took 10 minutes to get our drinks. Then we ordered a pretzel that took an hour to get. The pretzel was under cooked and greasy. The cheese was cold. Have been there many times and I keeps getting worse"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. Normal beer selection and prices, but never tried the food. Played pool and lots of tvs. They have another room to this place which had a live band the night I went. Seemed like an older crowd having a good time. They also got a volleyball area with a large crowd every time I run by. I may come back again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for YEARS and the \"jester room\" kept me here..there's a bartender named KELLY that is a total pro with a beautiful smile and service that is always ON POINT... their live music and excellent service keeps me coming back!  Their food is good if you order the \"right thing\"...bar food yano...."}
{"text":"We used to go here fairly often, but will never be back. On a recent visit, mid meal and sitting at the bar, my beer glass had been empty for 15 minutes and I simply could not get the attention of any of the several employees behind the bar. They were all too busy talking among themselves. I finally just started waving my arm trying to get someone's attention, and this prick behind the bar 20 yards away sees me and shouts back at me \"ok, yeah, we'll all just drop everything and attend to you\" and then ignored me and it was another 5 minutes before I could get another beer from another employee. They were not busy at all at the time.  This is how a business loses customers and reputation."}
{"text":"I was craving a burger after  a long day of bar hopping and the bacon cheeseburger I had for lunch the next day, Hit the spot. I ordered it medium and it was one of the best burgers I' ve had in five years."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and was pleased it wasn't busy. Food was good but the customer service was some of the worst I've experienced. In fact, the only reason I'm being generous with two stars is because the food was decent. I'm almost certain the woman serving us was completely wasted too. All in all, the experience here was garbage and I won't be back here again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food and service are usually very good.   Stopped in tonite around midnight for a late meal and it happened to be \"reverse happy hour\". Very good prices with most items under $5.   Ordered the French dip, chicken fingers and potato skins. Waitress came back after 10 min and said \".. sorry, no French dip, out of roast beef\". Told her \"No prob, I'll be fine with the other stuff I ordered.\". Sheesh was I wrong..  Anyway, long story short.. Service was crap, drinks were dilute and the chicken fingers tasted fishy (so did the accompanying fries).   Potato skins were so over cooked that no amount of sour cream was enough lubricant to choke down those leather-like turds.  Oh yes, the waitress forgot to remove the $9.99 charge for the French dip that they ran out of. Okay, whatever.  My advice is avoid eating here after 8p. It's fine during lunch, happy hour and dinner but try to stay away from the food after 8p. Ask for a bag of chips (or a punch in the stomach) if you're hungry.  Blah."}
{"text":"I go here with the fish forum and they always take care of us...even if we are pains in the butt. Bar food but still good"}
{"text":"I've patronized Pranksters Too for several years, primarily to attend live music. In fact, I think I've only sat on the \"sports bar\" side a couple of times. I moved away for a few years and just moved back several months ago. It's my understanding that there has been a change in ownership, and in reading other reviews, apparently not everyone has been thrilled with some of the changes. For me, as my wife and I attend the live music jams, the biggest changes I have seen is an apparent drop in attendance, enthusiasm, and energy, both by the performers and the patrons. I'm not making a judgement or pretending to understand the reasons for those changes, but I do definitely feel it. The Sunday night menagerie jam used to be a pretty big event with multiple musicians performing a high caliber level of music. Well, the Sunday night jams were canceled a few months ago. Fortunately, the Wednesday night acoustic jam is still there, but even that is not the same. I kinda feel sorry for Chuck E Baby, as he always does his best to entertain and is genuine with his audience. But the last jam I attended this past week had to be disappointing for both the musicians (all 5 of them, including the 2 who \"sat in\" towards the end of the gig), and also for the management. The crowd in attendance was interactive, but very small.  To his credit, Dave, who I understand is the owner, was as engaged as he possibly could be. He was not only the host, but also the server, and he was right there monitoring the entire night. He didn't miss a beat when it came to providing excellent service to all in attendance, so kudos to him on his engagement and service.  I've seen some complaints from others about prices. Well, I don't see an issue there at all. I'm not saying the drinks are the cheapest, but the prices are not bad, especially when the bartender makes the drinks well, as we have experienced. I guess my take on that is, if you have to pinch a few pennies when you're supposed to be out having a good time on a night off from work, then maybe you should just stay home and save your money. I know that personally,  I work hard, so when I'm out, I'm trying to relax and enjoy the moment, so I'm not going to sweat paying fifty cents more for a drink. I mean, seriously? This is especially true when the live entertainment is free with no cover. And on that note, if you're still reading this, please make sure you tip the musicians when you're in that environment.  As far as the kitchen and food is concerned, I have always received the food properly prepared and promptly delivered. I especially like the thin crust pizza! (And the popcorn is great if you just want a snack). So, I'm giving the current business status 4 stars, as there is room for improvement. I hope that management is able to get a handle on whatever it is that needs to transpire to return the energy and enthusiasm to the previous levels. If that happens, I'll gladly update my review and bump it up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I was not too satisfied with the wings this time it seemed like they were definitely overcooked... was a real bummer to my wife but they did not serve Blended margaritas oh well... ended the night with the waitress totally screwing up the bill... Next time I'll just go to Spokes it's in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Wings are small and overpriced.  $8.99 for 10 wings. With tax comes to $10 and change.  Then the obligatory $2 tip because it's not the SERVER'S fault this is such a shitty deal. The servers are excellent and I like the place. I craved wings and paid DOUBLE what I would pay at Casey Moore's for better wings. GRRRRR!!!"}
{"text":"When I used to live in the Scottsdale ghetto, I was just around the corner from Prankster's.  Love love LOVED the place....cheap beer, friendly staff, TRIVIA!  What's not to like?  I did have one bad experience here though, but that was due solely to my accidentally double-booking and having 2 dates (one on each side of the bar) at Prankster's at the same time.  'm fairly certain I got caught early in the night, but was drunk enough I just kept denying!  Oopsies!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Me and my roommate are regulars here (Marco and Ryan - the guy with the hat on all the time haha) and we love how we can walk like 2 minutes to get there.  The staff is great especially when they have Bryan back there cooking up the food.  They have great food for being a little dive bar.  Some nights are super dead, but there's usually a nice crowd on volleyball nights and friday and saturday."}
{"text":"Awesome support of local music! Yummy food, great drinks! I have many times for musical performances legends of the valley plays are often they are now expanding and opening the Arizona music and entertainment Hall of Fame Museum right next door is going to be incredible don't miss it!"}
{"text":"I love that there is a locals place right within walking distance of my apartment.  I've been drinking there for a couple weeks now and I love the good beer and cheap prices.  I just ate there for the first time last night and the chicken sandwich and curly fries are delicious.  The service is reasonable, the atmosphere is friendly, and the patio makes for a great hang out."}
{"text":"As a Scottsdale local I have been going to Pranksters Too for about 4 years now. If you are anything like me and you want to avoid the bull sh*t Scottsdale yuppy scene this is a great place to start:  -Awesome friendly service  -Awesome prices and happy hour  -The waitresses aren't Playboy looking stuck up skanks, they're mostly hot, personable and like to bull sh*t and talk to their tables  -Food is way above average for a \"dive\" bar if you choose to call it that. In fact the food is decent for any type of bar. The loaded Nachos are gigantic and for $8 bucks you can't go wrong   -They have lots of Tv's and a variety of things on them, mostly sports and they are great at changing chanels to the game you want  -2 pool tables and a full size shuffle board  -sand volley ball out back  -small pitchers of beer are $3.75  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"always a good time here with a variety of local bands and plenty of room to drink, dance and socialize.  the sound system was awesome and I like to search upcoming local acts to see who is playing.  thus was not my first time here and I enjoyed it again."}
{"text":"For a bar with a private party- its a great place. Good bar menu and the food they served as a buffet was decent and plentiful. Nice local bar to experience on a trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I have been here and Pranksters (1?) many times.  My buddy Pete and I would go after working at MDS all evening, and it was needed.  We would just order pitchers and drink, and eat wings, and drink, and eat more wings, and drink, then finish off with a little pool.  The booze and food are cheap here, at least they were in 2007 (I've been lazy in writing this review).  Depending on the night, the women were cheap too, but not easy!"}
{"text":"Ho-hum. Not awful, but not great.  Good things: 1. great service 2. Really nice waitresses 3. They have a veggie plate  That's it for good things.  Not so good things: 1. Food was average, I could have gotten the same or better at most bars. The veggies on my veggie plate were probably fresher a couple days ago.  2. I could have probably made better nachos at home, and I can barely cook. Does making nachos count as cooking by the way? For me it does, but I wonder if most people consider it cooking? 3. Patrons seemed a little downtrodden...it was depressing.  Anyway, I guess what was missing from Pranksters was that certain something. Charm maybe? It was just ehhh, I didn't feel like I was hanging out at a fun place. It was big, mostly empty, and boring. I like to go to a place and meet people who are interesting to talk to and that has nice atmosphere. This place and the people in it seemed like they were beat down by life. I wanted to get out of there before I fell down that hole.   I need to find a fun place to bike to on Sunday afternoons where I can have a couple of cocktails and something good to eat cheap. Does this place exist in South Scottsdale?"}
{"text":"Came here a few times because some of my friends are on a pool league that plays here once in a while. So we sat down and a waitress took our order and that was the last time I saw her that night. WTF. Other waitresses brought our food - which seemed to take a really long time. I just ordered a simple burger not a five course meal from a French restaurant FFS. Anyway, my friend tells me \"I love the service here!\" \"Really?\" I asked, quite suprised that he'd say such a thing. \"No\" he said. And we both laughed. Because the service really WAS a joke. We did finally see our waitress a few times that night but she managed to come by when we DIDN'T need anything because some other waitress took care of us. I wouldn't really give a darn if she hadn't introduced herself to us as \"the waitress who will be taking care of us tonight.\" I suppose I'll be back one day but just for the sake of hanging out with those friends - not because of anything compelling about the bar itself. The pool tables aren't bad though - there I did it - I said something nice about the place. Amen."}
{"text":"I've ridden by this place on the greenbelt trail for a decade now. Walked right by it on my way to Fresh and Douchey for years. Never stopped in until today. Always got a vibe from this place that it wasn't worth my time.  Dark as hell inside, which seems like a true feat mid afternoon in AZ without a cloud in the sky. Maybe they need some more shit on the windows to finish the job and block all natural light from penetrating the dankness.   Its certainly a divey shit hole inside, but the prices don't reflect that. Way too much for a drink that may have contained 6 molecules of vodka, and even that's a generous estimate.  Service was meh, but even if it was stellar, I wouldn't stick around for another boozeless cocktail.   I came, I saw, its not for me, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place when it's busy and I'm power houring it. The food here is not your reg sports bar food...  its really really good. I was so surprised. Just don't order onion rings... you get three. There are certain days to go into the Jester room and if you glance in when you arrive then you'll know if its right...."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and the food service has progressively become worse. Their prices used to be reasonable, but recently I noticed they upped the price $1 on every menu item. I came here a night ago and i waited a half hour just to get a soda. Never going back"}
{"text":"Not a bad place, and... errr... Not really a good place either. There's nothing distinguishable about this place, but it seems friendly, and their prices are decent. Bonus points if you have to live in that south Scottsdale/Thomas rd. corridor. Its very spacious there too, for those that are somewhat claustrophobic!"}
{"text":"Pretty empty on a Tuesday night, but that just means faster service and less strange characters at the bar. The only decent conversation was with a 75 year old bar regular, not exactly sure if that is how I would spend my golden years, but too each his own. They still have good size mini-pitchers of Bud light at $5.50 and the food special was very tasty on this night. It was a chicken parmesan sandwich on a round bun. The cutlet was breaded perfectly and it was just a great tasting meal with wedge fries (one of the better sides). Someday, they also will replace the TV sets, but it might not be in our lifetime."}
{"text":"So upsetting how this great place went to crap!  Food is below average.  The last several times I have been here the sandwiches have been lousy but the wings were always pretty good.  So after giving up on burgers and sandwiches went to get wings tonight and the prices are now beyond ridiculous.  More than a buck a wing even when you order 24 and 48, for this place!  It's not even clean inside, it's a dive bar.  Sorry guys I'm done!"}
{"text":"Heading to a dive bar you think it's unlikely you could be disappointed...  Short and sweet... no rant...  mediocre food, once they get it right that is...  food and drinks overpriced...  Maybe the 99¢ store next door should have been a tip off.  Great potential...  just has a creepy abandoned amusement park feel to it..."}
{"text":"If it's good enough for #fuckinjay it's good enough! That little bastard sips jim beam from a dirty ashtray while suspended from the ceiling in a birdcage"}
{"text":"This place is an energy-drain.  It used to be a wonderful local jewel, yet has fallen short with abrupt waitresses and patrons who embody rough living.  I now understand the comment in the reviews which stated \"You shouldn't eat in an establishment if your feet stick to the floor.\"   The last time I went to this place, someone was throwing up in the parking lot as the regulars laughed.  The few times I went back, I felt like I was reliving the 'stairs' scene in Poltergeist --  https://youtu.be/lN8G9Wsnb6s  A group of wandering souls haunting the people with great life-force.  Spending too many evenings in this plagued pit will age people 5 years."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were here today for a FRAG (reef tank geeks) meeting and lecture. I know. In a bar. Called \"Pranksters Too.\" The speaker, who had come in from California, was amused by it as well.   That said, I was pleasantly surprised by the extensive menu (someone at our table likened it to the Cheesecake Factory) which included salads, fried apps, burgers, sandwiches, croissants, pizza-pan sized heaps of nachos, soup, and quesadillas.   We shared a zucchini and mushroom appetizer which was breaded (in-house, I believe) with something light, crispy, and nicely seasoned. They did not taste greasy at all. I had a delicious and perfectly cooked sourdough burger and Hubby had a croissant sandwich which could have been better (the croissant was not crisp and flaky and he could not taste the avocado very well).   The service was very good for as chaotic and packed as the group made it. Let alone all the styro containers of coral frags that people had all over the tables to show and sell. It's like a drug smorgasbord, and there are deals being made at every table. I'm telling you, unless you are DINKs, I don't recommend getting started in this hobby...   But I digress. Pranksters Too is a large venue with friendly staff that handled our group very well. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"A dive bar with many different things to do!  Check the board for specials."}
{"text":"After a long morning of fun at Big Surf we were looking for a quick place to stop for a drink and late lunch. Pranksters Too came up, so we went ahead and tried it. It was really spacious inside, and is located along the Scottsdale Greenbelt- I've seen it from the Greenbelt before.. Tons of TVs, pool, games and upside down beer signs. They had a bratwurst special for $3 including a side. Seemed like a good deal, but I went with the hot dog because I was in the mood with the potato salad. The potato salad was pretty good, and the drinks were poured well. I liked the kiddie games they had, we did the claw game and I didn't win anything as usual. Had my eye on the elephant plush.  Overall, it was a nice quick spot to grab a drink and grub and get on with our Saturday. I will probably go back. (:"}
{"text":"I used to live behind this place, and it is pretty awesome.  Pranksters is great for a neighborhood bar.  The food is good for what you would expect.  Don't come here if you want super fine dining, but if you want to get solid bar food, and a good buzz, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"One of the bars in the South Scottsdale Dive-Bar circuit.  Prankster's is the go-to spot when day drinking at the San Tropez pool just isn't enough - I usually (100% of the time) regret my decision to continue the festivities but always have a great time doing it!  The thing about Prankster's too is that you have to have the right mentality when going there.  Don't expect one of those 'looks divey on the outside but it's probably nice on the inside' bars!  This is one of those bars where you can play pool, toss a game of video bags, drink 32 oz beers, catch a local live band, or just sit at the bar and wait - because ineviteably someone interesting will sit down next to you.  Note that I omitted the following things from that list:  1.  Feeling cool wearing designer jeans 2.  Feeling cool with hair product in 3.  Feeling cool really at all 4.  Picking up chicks 5.  Impressing chicks that you've already picked up  If you live in the So Sco area and don't want to drive very far and just want to get drunk, head on down to your local Prankster's Too.  You'll probably regret it in the morning but at least you'll have a good, inexpensive time that night."}
{"text":"I give this place a 5-star review because of the Jokester Room. Every Thursday night they have a free bues concert by Hans Olson, who is an amazing musician. He can play any song you can throw out at him. I really wanted to hear Me and Bobby McGee, and he did a beautiful job.   The beer is cheap, good specials, and the pineapple bacon pizza looked very tasty. I'd recommend checking this place out if you're in the area. If I lived in Phoenix, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now.  The first time I met a few friends here early on New Years Eve and ordered the chicken strips with fries which were surprisingly above average as far as fried strips of chicken go.  There aren't really drink specials and this place is way bigger than necessary.  It has a lot of stupid jokes about it being ZANY and KOOKY cause it's called PRANKSTERS, like backwards letters and stupid puns.  Get it?  They're NUTS over there, totally OUT OF THEIR MINDS with KOOKINESS.  A comrad of mine ordered the \"Irish nachos\" which were similar to nachos but instead of chips they were fries.  While he seemed to enjoy them, I personally think that's fucking retarded and gross. Like how Filibertos and similar 24 hour Mexican drive thrus offer fries with cheese and a SHIT LOAD of other unnecessary grease for your disgusting fat ass pleasure.    On New Years Eve my comrads and I ordered some Irish car bombs which, as I recall, were reasonably priced, maybe six bucks each which is not bad for an instant buzz.  Also, the server was talkative, comfortable and friendly which made the experience nice and lighthearted.   I convinced my boyfriend to come here a second time and try the food to see what he thought.  He got in touch with his inner chubby jr high kid self and ordered what they called \"pizza skins\" which were half potatoes covered with pizza cheese and pepperoni.  These, much like the fries, were total over kill.  Potatoes with a bunch of mozzarella and pepperoni can never be a good idea, Pranksters.  I took one bite and wanted to get in touch with my inner bulimic jr high kid self.  There is a reason you don't usually find potato skin pizzas at other places, it's not cause Prankster's is original, it's cause they seem to just throw shit like meat and cheese on anything and call it something presentable like \"pizza skins,\" which sounds tasty in theory.   Despite the potato pizza with grease-meat and fat-cheese, we got a pitcher of their seasonal beer for five bucks and it was mellow and not too filling and not a bad beer for the price.    Ironically, much like their pizza skins and Irish fries, the service is a little over kill.  We had about 17 servers come over during the course of our meal roughly every 6.5 seconds to make sure we were doing okay.  We had two come over and ask us if we wanted the check after we'd already paid it.  I'm curious as to who got the tip.   In retrospect though, Pranksters Too wasn't a horrible experience, the atmosphere is dreary yet unpretentious and there is something to be said for the charming ignorance (or maybe it's the ZANY KOOKINESS) that comes with, you know, just adding cheese and meat to everything."}
{"text":"Decent food good service. They have two volleyball courts and a large patio. I really enjoy the fried zucchini."}
{"text":"excellent time on new years eve.  az/dz and van halen and scorpion tribute bands were all very fun!  GREAT SERVICE and people enjoying their food as well.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Very diverse and friendly crowd staff is always problems and friendly good bar to sit back relax and have fun with friends."}
{"text":"Their bartendar's, clearly think regulars run the show!...well if that's how you want to run your business that's fine, my tab after 2 hours was $190...generally I would tip $60 off of a tab like that but after the abuse of a regular and zero back up from your management I will NEVER visit your establishment again!...Unfortunately for you I work @ the casino down the road and I will encourage my coworkers to go elsewhere!...good job folks!"}
{"text":"ehhhhh....... If your not here for live music or cheap drinks then why are you here? ITS NOT FOR THE FOOD. Good lord, they must have a monkey cooking at this place, it's just awful. Chicken strips and a patty melt. Chicken strips were rock hard. We ordered the patty melt medium well, it came out basically raw. We sent it back. At this point we're not upset, no big deal. 20 minutes have passed and our burger isn't back yet. We are the ONLY ONES IN HERE!! WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG?? But the cherry on top, the Xmas decorations were going up, employees bumping our table, bumping into our chairs, come on!!!!  We're the ONLY ONES sitting at a table in here!!  We had enough and asked for the bill. The waitress was great, she was going to comp us the burger, but we declined. Then she was going to box it up and give it to us, we declined again. We just wanted to go.  Pranksters is Live music and cheap drinks......thats it."}
{"text":"I love this bar, everyone needs a place they can go in their pajamas and get a jager bomb at 10:00 in the morning with no judgment. Not saying I do that, I am just saying it's nice to have the option."}
{"text":"From early on in the day, I had it planned out that this was the bar that I was going to come to.  It's a nice ride from my house to here, right along the Green Belt.  I was pretty stoked to try it out because I'd passed by it a million times but had never been inside.  My girlfriend said that she'd been inside before and thought it weird and depressing and wasn't sold on it, but finally I was like, \"C'mooooon...\" and she gave in.  Fuck my ass, she was right.  I kind of wish I'd listened, but I'm also sort of weirdly glad that I did end up going because now my curiosity is sated.  When we came in, we grabbed a seat and the waitress asked us what we'd like to drink and we weren't quite sure yet and asked to see a menu and to just have a couple waters for right now.  Before we even got the waters, she asked me to start a tab with my card, which I thought was weird because, I don't know, what if I ended up not getting anything?  She also asked me really shitty, too, like she had some weird (and incorrect) sixth sense that I was gonna rip her off.  Oh, well.  So, we were chillin', my girlfriend and I, just waiting for her to come back to take our drink order and she just... she never came back.  We saw her walking around and talking to other people and bringing them pitchers of beer but she, like, literally never came by to take our drink orders.  I'm not sure how long I waited, but I smoked an entire cigarette and listened to an obnoxious and terrible Guns and Roses ballad that was particularly cocaine-inspired (and someone inside turned the goddamn volume up from a 3 to an 11), so maybe 11 minutes?  I ended up going inside--I really wanted a beer then and there--and taking my order from the bar.  The bartender was busy and didn't get to me right away, but I understood.  She looked very busy.  I saw my waitress come inside and go behind the bar and I expected her to jump in for the bartender and be like, \"Hey!  What can I get you?\"  Instead, she spent something like a solid minute just drinking from a styrofoam soda cup.  I had my wallet out as a signifier of \"look! money!\" but she just, uh... it was really weird.  I looked right at her, and she at me and we made eye contact while she was sucking on the straw and it was a battle of wills.  It was a staring contest.  I finally broke away and lost because I felt weird.  The bartender came up to me and asked if she could get me anything.  Two beers please!  She helpfully told me that a small pitcher'd be cheaper and I get a little bit more.  I told her I had a card on file and my waitress was like, \"He's at [service industry code for a table I'm at that went over my head].  I'm helping him.\"  \"Oh, you're helping him?\"  The bartender asked.  \"Yeah,\" The waitress responded.  She looked at me and back at the bartender and just shrugged her shoulders and motioned toward me.  \"I... I don't know.\"  Like I'm the fucking asshole for waiting enough of a long goddamn time and getting the drinks my fucking self... well, not myself, but from the bartender.  You know what I mean!  I will award this place two stars because I liked the bartender and because that was one of the most refreshing beers I've ever had.  It will live long in my memory.  When I'm old and senile and running around the yard like Willy Lohman, I will be recreating that beer in my mind.  \"Ah, delicious!\"  I'll say to no one.  \"What a beautiful day in Scottsdale!\""}
{"text":"4 bars in one! Love the LIVE music in the Jester Room side of this place!. Volleyball outside; huge patio with TV's: huge spots bar ..... affordable food and beverage and they serve late every night of the week."}
{"text":"Any bar thats within stumblijg distance to my house is okay by me.  I've always passed on Panksters Too because its in a strip mall and sounds like some sort of prank/joke store to me.  So when my Nebraska friends wanted to watch the game there yesterday, I was excited to try someplace new.  The inside is bigger than it looks outside, and basically its your typical sports bar.  Good (big) TVs and plently of seating, especially since the place was barely half full, and a shuffle board table which I love.    You could walk in here in your pajamas and no one would care, which is great, but at the same time there wouldnt be anyone in there that you'd want to impress, so take that for what its worth.    Pitchers were cheap, food was good bar food (we had the chicken nachos...HUGE portion for about $8) and my other friends really liked their wings and quesadillas.    Plenty of seating for me and my 20 closest football fan friends, a great alternative to the more popular (and thus PACKED and pricey) Scottsdale sports bars."}
{"text":"Went for my friends birthday and it actually was a pretty cool place. Has two sections, one for comedy and entertainment, the other side had pool tables. Nice selection of drinks, people are very welcoming. I heard theres another location with a Pranksters so, I gotta go check that one out too :)"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since college, and every time I am over in the east valley I try to swing by for a beer. This is more of a sports bar and grill then anything else. They have more TV's then I can count, so at some point during football season you will probably find me checking in here again. If you are a sports fan of any kind you should check it out because they will have something that interests you on one of the TV's.  They also have outdoor seating, which is not always nice for Arizona weather, however their patio area is right on the golf course. It is actually nice to sit out there with the misters and see who comes by on the course.  The beer is always cold and they have specials everyday. Most of the people that work there during the week have been there a long time and super friendly. If you go there a couple of times they will most likely remember your name or at least what your drink of choice is.  The food is actually not bad but it is kind of just bar food. They do have a full menu, so you have a nice selection to choose from. My personal favorite are the chicken strips. They are oversized and the chicken is still moist and tender even though the strips are obviously fried.  I almost forgot to mention that they do have live music most weekends. It's a cool place that you should go check out. It does sit back in the corner of the shopping center but it's there. If you do go check it out, don't worry your not drunk or seeing things, a lot of the items on the wall are up side down on purpose."}
{"text":"Great bartenders.  Drinks are reasonably priced and can deliver some kick.  Was there to see some shows, great acts.  The downside is that the \"Jester Room\" where the acts perform would be a great venue (close to stage, lots of fun etc) but there were continual audio problems.  I felt horrible for the bands who clearly were frustrated.  I wish the bar had a decent sound system/sound guy who was in charge and more attentive. Warning:  The bathrooms are horrendous.  Several people commented that they have seen bathrooms in 3rd world countries that were kept in better shape."}
{"text":"First time here. Absolutely loving the wings! I'm out here celebrating my little girl's 21st birthday. Watching her play volleyball and eating potato skins and wings. Great outdoor bar and excellent service Really good place to spend a Friday night. I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Do Not Give Them Your Credit or Debit Card!!!! The waitress \"Eden\" took mine 2 weeks ago @ the beginning of the night, and then gave it to someone else.  She left for home at the end of the night after giving me the news.  Eden left the Mgr Sean Kenyon to deal with with me.  Oh yeah, they lost my card on my Birthday & didn't give a hoot. I have placed many, many calls to the owner Perry Bolster... He is not returning any of my calls. Will I go back?  NEVER!!!"}
{"text":"OK... so i think i have a thing for bars that are parted into multiple rooms... lol Just like the light house, long horn and so on this bar is separated into the Jester room and Pranksters too....   The Jester room is amazing... It has a full stage... *kinda tiny but it works lol* Tons of seating and a full bar... and some pool tables in the back... the Bands that played were fun, entertaining and it was seriously just a great time :) every night they have several bands signed up to play... and some regulars from what i take it...   we ordered some potato skins... fully loaded... soooo goood!!! the atmosphere was great! not to lite up and not so dark you cant see your own hand in your face... i liked it... the waitresses/bartenders were sweet... didn't really talk to them too much... i was only drinking water.. **DD**    i didn't really spend too much time on the other side... except for the bathrooms... wish i give a 4... they weren't all ritzy or anything but they were clean, with paper in the appropriate places ; ) if ya know what mean....   i am looking forward to going back there asap!! maybe check out the other side while I'm at it :)"}
{"text":"Very large sports bar that has just about everything you would want including sand volleyball with it's own bar and a horse OTB, sadly no dog racing. Plenty of TVs and they have all the games on or will put on whatever you want . A lot of diehard sports fans go here. The music room has live bands, occasionally there is a cover,usually way too loud. They have poker two nights a week.The patio is mostly smokers. The place is a fun  dive bar with plenty of regulars . Food and drink prices are very low with daily specials . Sandwiches are good but the pizza leaves a lot to be desired. All of the staff are very friendly except for this one blond waitress who finally left,she was in the wrong profession. There is parking in front and back. Bathrooms are kind of dumpy,they definitely need to be revamped. People of all ages go in here.it is not a trendy hipster Scottsdale club like you see in Old Town thus most of the people are very friendly and not there to impress anyone. This place is a lot of fun worth checking out.One of my all time favorite bars."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a casual dive bar for a couple of cheap drinks and to watch the game, this is your place. I had two Hi-Lifes for $5.50, and while it's not the champagne of beers, it's still pretty dang good with a lime.  Those around me had ordered wings, nachos and sandwiches. I'd caution you on the wings as I heard they weren't very good, either bone in or bone out. The nachos were big and looked delicious. If you're looking for a simple snack to go with your drink, get the chips which comes with a ranch dipping sauce. Made for a nice salty pairing to my beer.  Our waitress was super organized and gave us all numbers so that she could keep all of our bills separate. I love when people do that, especially when we have groups of 8 or more people. Overall, this is a dive bar so set your expectations accordingly, but I thought it was great."}
{"text":"My review was to be posted the week before they closed... So not surprised it finally did close. Ugh!"}
{"text":"Great, friendly staff, really good food for a bar, and decent drink prices. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"We stopped for a nice cold beer around 3 on Friday afternoon and was so disappointed by a semi cold draw. Nice size bar plenty of seating inside with a lot of TVs plus cute outdoor area but smelled of grease. It really would've been great with colder beer, nice friendly bartender and no grease smell!! Maybe she was having a bad day-I'll try it again hopefully just an off day. It really has potential to be a great hang out if it was cooler inside, cold beer and better fan system in the kitchen."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. I will never come back to this establishment again. I ordered a sandwich that came out on a sesame seed bun?? When I asked the bartender/server if this was right, she just smirked at me with a nodding gesture. I received the worst sandwich ever. It had two thin layers of turkey (most likely from fry's) extra lettuce and tomato (to hide what should actually be on it) and an untoasted sesame seed hamburger bun.  I had two bites. And asked her to take it away. She didn't care about the fact I didn't enjoy it. Or the fact I didn't even get to eat. She just took my full plate away, and brought me the entire bill. ABSOLUTE WORST! Never again."}
{"text":"This used to be a great dive bar...Not anymore.  The owner has decided to keep raising his prices and now the prices are at the range of a higher end Scottsdale bar but its still just a dirty old bar. The service is not spectacular... go ahead and try and figure out who works here and who is a patron. No special shirts of any kind... no uniform... nothing. The place is not exactly really clean either.  I am not saying its gross... but nothing special.  Its just a dive bar with high prices..  It has lost its way.  Drop the prices and become a dive bar again.  You were great then. now...nothing to go there for!  Please don't think I'm just cheap and complaining.  I am happy to pay the price for good food and great atmosphere. This place has neither. If you read my other reviews... I rarely complain or give negative reviews. I usually can find something positive about most places....  As far as Prankster's Too.... if they would go back to being the dive bar they were good at and lower the prices to what a good dive bar should be charging.... I would be back.  But I'm not gonna pay premium prices at a sub prime bar!"}
{"text":"This place is a dump.  The broken.  Out of everything.  The unprofessionalism, the fact the staff didn't care to help, staff chasing staff out of the building, and the waitress specifically, was a shame.  Waiting for 40 minutes for food.  This bar could use a bar rescue. I dare the guy who runs this place to go to yucca tap room and order their nachos.  What they have versus this place...well..."}
{"text":"After a nice dinner at Carlsbad Tavern, I was in the mood to shoot pool....since they didn't have a pool table at Carlsbad Cavern, they suggested I drive down the street to Prankster's Too.  I made the short trip and was pleased to find what I would describe as a Sports Bar style joint.  There were 2 pool tables and a full sized shuffleboard as well as some random video games and plenty of plasma TVs.  I was disappointed though to find nobody playing pool.  So, I saddled up to the bar and ordered a Beer and decided to wait and see if a game would start up.  After 20 minutes or so a few guys went over and started playing pool.  I went to the table next to them and was about to rack it up when a couple of guys stopped by and asked if I wanted to play a game of cutthroat.  I actually hate playing that game, but wanted to play and agreed.  After a few minutes I realized that I was getting Hustled.....one guy was acting like the sucker and the other was the ringer.....this wasn't my 1st Rodeo and knew I was getting played....so I decided to play along and pull the rug out from under them.    After letting me win the 1st 2 games, I could sense that they were about to pounce and start making wagers on the games....I laughed and told them I was going home.  They were pissed and wanted to know why I was taking off....I told them that I don't play games for money with Hustlers and they laughed.  I told them I knew what was going on and pointed out what they were doing.  They both laughed and said \"Alright, you got us....\", then said....if you were that smart, then I was probably good enough to beat them straight up.  I told them....they will never know.  Then I left....ha!  Will I return?  Hell yeah....next time with my sticks and will find those 2 for a real match."}
{"text":"I love this place. The happy hour from 3pm - 6pm is very excellent. 1/2 price appetizers and wonderful booze specials. How could you go wrong? i'll tell you how...buy not visiting here.  Plenty of TVs for watching your Judge Judy or Sports, your choice.  -will"}
{"text":"We love a good dive bar. The atmosphere is unique. When you walk in thus place you are instantly confused. Pranksters Too can't make it's mind on what is wants to be.   A live music venue? The Jester Room is a cramped little area to watch live music. Cool. But 'tis a dump. A sports bar? Yeah, TV's are everywhere, but I think they were purchased in 1995. HD...ever heard of it? A dive bar? Normally dive bars make up for bad music and out dated TV's with service. Not Pranksters Too. I finished my beer, asked for another round, and waited 45 minutes. Did I get a teeth cracking cold brew? No. My check. Easy to tip on that service. It was a Tuesday night.  If you have options, venture down to Dukes. Don't bother with Pranksters Too."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the live music. Which is why I'm giving them 2 stars, instead of 1 star.  I came with a good sized party of drinking people that would have ordered significantly more alcohol if it didn't take over 40 minutes to get shots... 40 minutes  and counting as I type this review...  The waitress/server, is totally inattentive. The only person to come over and ask if we needed anything, seemed to be intoxicated and I'm not even sure if she actually worked for this place or not. When she asked if we were \"ok\" she didn't even notice that I said, \"no.\" She was very pleasant though, whoever she was. Another reason for the second star.  The server just came over again after 46 minutes... no mention of the shots or the food that we ordered.... SMH...  Over 45 minutes for fried zucchini and 2 shots... At least I know that next time I need to eat and probably drink before coming to watch a band here...  And in the end, we asked about the shots she clearly had forgotten they were ordered.  Food finally came and it's good. 1 more star, so 3 stars total."}
{"text":"Big fan if the atmosphere of pranksters and the menu and beer selection.  It's on the greenbelt so you feel like you are in a park. They also sponsor vball teams as well and it. Feels like a great neighborhood bar every time you walk in.  Trivia and board games are available and their staff all seems to mix well like family."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar with all of your greasy dive bar food. Damn good coconut shrimp and cheese fries though. Beer is cheap and food hits the spot after too much day drinking."}
{"text":"Local bars.. this is my favorite. We made a song about it. \"we prankin prankin prankin\". There is a little arm movement that goes with it - untranslatable by the written word.  Is it bad I am giving this place 5 stars mainly because i can ride my bike there?    trivia is fun. food never disappoints. blue moon pitchers. yay. happy hour prices are lovely.  the jukebox is usually ours.  I also love how the name of the place have become a verb in our everyday vernacular: \"well we were prankin thursday night and...\" or just a simple text: \"wanna prank?\"  they have stand up comedy on tuesday nights.   yes. this has been the spring/summer of my now favorite strip mall bar. i will love that place forever."}
{"text":"I don't usually remember what happens here because every time I go in I come out a different man. Hahaha. Totally fun place to come in with a group.  Pool tables, darts and specials everyday. The staff is friendly but the bathrooms could use a revamp and perhaps some professional cleaning.  Still it's a place I treasure because of the memories and its pretty rad that on the other side you can watch a show from time to time at Jesters."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for a good dive bar, so I'm pretty fond of this place. That being said, I RARELY go INSIDE of Pranksters. Alllllll about that patio. First of all, great view of the greenbelt and the sunset and stuff. There are booths and picnic tables outside so it's fun to go sit with a group. I've played in a volleyball league here before too and that was a LOT of fun and I definitely want to do it again. They bring a bar out near the volleyball courts which is awesome because you can grab a PBR in between games or sometimes they will give you a free shot if you have to wait a while to play- wooohooo! The bar food here is good to munch on. The nachos are INSANE. They are served on a pizza pan or if you're out by the volleyball court, in a large pizza box. They are the largest platter of nachos I have ever seen. Great drunk snack and great for a big group. I like to come here and sit outside and get pitchers of Kilt Lifter. If you go with the right expectation, I'm sure you'll like it. Also, I live basically right across the street now so it takes two seconds for me to walk over on the street or greenbelt...star for convenience!"}
{"text":"I used to live down the street from this place and it was always the easiest place for me to go watch a game or have a drink after work.   If not for the \"Turkey in the Slaw\", I would probably would not have gone very often, but that thing was awesome.   Other than that, typical sports bar with decent prices."}
{"text":"Do not call them wings. DO NOT. So overcooked they were stewed.  And besides the small child sitting at the bar beside us, unattended, the place was looking like an ad for AA. Old ppl staring down thier PBR. Okay they do have some redeeming qualities....great bands in THE JESTER ROOM, attached but not inside, and great volleyball tournaments outside. That's where the pre-AA crowds hang. Their bar pies are passabel when you need something to soak up the stale beer. Yes, they have TVs for you sports fans. It's okay if everything else is closed. or if the band is good. I don;t know how they stay around to be honest. I guess volleyball makes you thirsty."}
{"text":"If you're not local or a regular, save your money.  This is a dive bar, pure and simple.  The bar counter is too high for the bar stools,  the floors are cement, things just look dirty.  We came to play trivia, but the trivia boxes don't work.  Didn't have high expectations, and they weren't even met. Go 4 miles to Dukes."}
{"text":"I just joined a volleyball league at Prankster's Too in south Scottsdale.  The outdoor volleyball area is very nice.  Good sand.  Nice lighting.  Full outdoor bar.  If I were only rating the outdoor part of Prankster's, I would give it a 5/5.  The inside of the bar needs to be updated.  Its kind of dark and outdated and just needs some attention."}
{"text":"Live music is great. The food and drinks aren't so bad either. Great atmosphere every time I've gone."}
{"text":"I have to say that while the band I saw at Prankster Too's Jester Room was fantastic, the venue I was not all that fond of. Mind you, I can only really comment on the Jester Room as that is where I spent my entire visit.  I think my biggest issue was the layout. It's longer than wider, which isn't really appropriate for a music venue. While we decided to grab bar chairs and move ourselves up in the middle of it, I'm sure people in the bad could not see the band at all. In my opinion, that ruins a small intimate show.   Additionally, the service was slow. The waitresses seemed to get confused and it took us a good half hour after we sat down before anyone stopped by to see if we would like anything.   I'd go there if the band was worthwhile, but that is pretty much it."}
{"text":"Super place for football watching, trivia, and volleyball extravaganzas.   Food/Service: The tuna melt is actually AMAZING and I would go here just for that. Staff is attentive and friendly, will likely call you \"hon.\" The chili is good. Beer prices are awesome. Other than that, the food is very mundane, no-frills kind of food.   Atmosphere:  A strange thing I love about Pranksters is that I can always count on going here in sweats and no makeup, and not caring about what I look like. No one in here is judging you. It's a different crowd than you'll get in Oldtown. Expect an occasional shit-faced tenant who is too loud, harassing the waitresses, and spitting on the floor. It's all part of the magical experience that is Prankster's Too."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a comedy show there on a Wednesday night. Perry and Tracy provided excellent service to us.  The fried mushrooms and zucchini weren't well done. The cardinal potato appetizer was also appealing.  The ambiance and the environment with surrounding cases included celebrity memorabilia, and a nice dark brown bar area.  There's another room with pool tables; we didn't check those out, but they exist for those who'd want to play.  Interesting place; I'd only improve if by offering a hefeweizen beer or Modelo Especial. Other than that, a good time."}
{"text":"I was soo disappointed.  We went to watch football and for pool league scoring class.  The food was cold and the service was terrible.  The bar tender was amazing which is why they are getting the rating they are.  We waited more tham half an hours for service from our waitress.  They have plenty of televisions which is great but service is lacking.  We will not return."}
{"text":"Great food!! We rode our bikes here and sat outside on the patio. We weren't sure about this place because the patio furniture was kinda iffy. We ordered drinks and appetizers. Fried cheese, mushrooms and zucchini. It was so good!! We shared an order of chicken nachos that were really good too. Huge portion! The waitresses were really friendly. The prices are reasonable. I think we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Nice beer selections, daily drink specials, food is not so great. Wouldn't recommend eating here at all. Plenty of TVs for sports and there are two volleyball courts in the back which are usually occupied by leagues. Patio was recently expanded to fit more tables. All in all... This is a spot to go for sports and if you're not looking for anything fancy."}
{"text":"Went to see a concert at \"The Hall\" -interesting place . I didn't eat there - I just went for the concert . As you go in the concert hall bands had their merch set up in booths on the right and a bigger spot on the left . The bar is on the right side of the hall and restrooms were in the back on the right .  There's a lot to see once inside . They had quite a lot of collectibles and memorabilia dedicated to music . It took at least 30 minutes to soak it all in . It showed a lot of Arizona music culture .   There are a lot of tables for plenty of seating - the room is large and without tables could hold a decent crowd if it was SRO . The concert stage is in the left corner - kind of different than the usual middle . Decent sized stage . Sound was crisp and clear . Lighting was ok . I did notice they tried to get a fog machine going but some fans dispersed it . Also there was a passageway with a black curtain showing the goings on behind the stage - it'd be cool if someone closed it earlier for better stage ambiance. Maybe angle the fog away from the fans ....small things that didn't stray away from the great night of music . I'm nitpicking I know ...it's those little things that can help \"sell the drama\" of the performances. The bands were all great .   Ordered a Lemmy (jack and coke) . On special $4.50 . Definitely be back . Bar staff and security staff all cool !"}
{"text":"Service is beyond sub par.  Brunette waitress who appears to be pregnant acts like taking your order is inconvenient.  My food sat in the window while the cook rang the bell over and over and she walked up and yelled \"how many times are you going to ring the bell\".  Not surprisingly food was lukewarm but not poorly prepared.  Feel sorry for the kitchen since cold food and long waits clearly aren't their issue.  Several people in the bar were overserved to the point of a drunken stupor (illegal in Scottsdale).  Fight almost broke out between two men next to me.    Needs real management.  Likely a candidate for the show Bar Rescue."}
{"text":"Huge patio which is nice but only four TINY TVs. And I mean TINY (30\" and 22\") as well as a 18\" tube TV which is off (not that it matters).  Live music is nice.  Had the chicken teriyaki sandwich. Small and tasteless."}
{"text":"Please reopen my neighborhood bar i miss the tweeters scattered amongst the volleyball players amongst the rockers. Favorite bar in Scottsdale aside from Gillian's"}

{"text":"for a neighborhood bar the food is good. prices are reasonable and the service is really good"}
{"text":"Common! No one wants your crappy Breakfast!   I love Pranksters Too. It is the perfect local dive sports bar. At night you have your faithful barfly's challenging you to a game of poker or pool. There is loyal Suns and Cards fans yelling obscenity's. When Steve Nash throws the ball into the stands during the fourth quarter of a playoff game because he can't run anymore because the Suns never gave him a backup (Thank you Rajon Rondo trade), the Pranksters people start breaking things.  One night about four years ago there were about forty Sorority girls there. It is a night we will talk about for ages like it happened yesterday.  Celeste is a great hostess type bartender to the establishment and always makes me feel welcome. There is a guy bartender (whose name I can never remember) who also makes Pranksters a home.      I stopped by this morning taking my Mom out for the Michigan football game. I am starving and want some good football food. The bartender hands me some crappy breakfast menu. COMMON! No one wants your crappy breakfast ! The eight people at the table in  front of me refused the breakfast  also.  It is not only Pranksters pulling this joke on the consumer. (Pun intended)  Other bars try this crap on us while attempting to watch an early morning football games.  Give me a hamburger, a Ruben or some Nachos .    I will return. In fact, I left my Mom there while I do a load of laundry and post this review.       It is now 11 and I can order some real food."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place is called \"Pranksters\", but the joke was definitely on me. After being whisked here by an older crowd, I opened the door and thought I was at the wrong place. This could have been an AARP meeting! The vast majority of customers appeared to be senior citizens.  But it wasn't uncomfortable at all. I played some pool and had some appetizers. Hot wings were decent, but the mozzarella sticks were questionably soft, probably so their regulars could gum them. The waitress was good, and managed to keep making her rounds even though the place was packed.  We jammed out to some covers of 60's music. I was then informed that I had seen only half the bar...  ...the other half looks like a completely different place. You can't really hear the live music, the crowd is much younger, and it looks more like a sports bar than a music venue. Why the larger side wasn't used for the venue is a mystery, but I guess having two bars in one makes for interesting times. Just not interesting enough for me to go out of the way. If you get stuck in Scottsdale, do check it out though. It was cheap!"}
{"text":"While on a family bike ride (girl 10, boy 4) along the green belt yesterday  (Sunday) we decided to stop in at Pranksters Too for a bite to eat and some refreshments. While this isn't necessarily a family establishment as there were no kids menus nor did I spot any highchairs I wouldn't say it was wholly kid unfriendly either (daytime hours only that is).  Mardee was our server and she was not only a sweetheart but incredibly attentive workout being annoying.  The kids got Shirley Temples and they were thrilled by the large cups they came in and by the multiple cherries adorning those big cups.  The Mr. and I shared a pitcher of Blue Moon that came with cold glasses and plenty of orange slices. For food we ordered cheddar jalapeno poppers, loaded potato skins, 6 honey boneless wings, 6 hot boneless wings. I saw they had a few different salads avaliable but just as I don't go to a Mexican restaurant for a cheeseburger I don't go to the bar to eat pretty much anything that's not fried.  The food was on point for what it was.  Fried hard without being super greasy. There's also off track horse race betting which the Mr.  enjoys but unfortunately didn't get lucky at this day.  And lots of tv's with various sports which also made the Mr. Happy."}
{"text":"The best bar in the valley to see live music.  The food is good, the drinks are reasonable, and the bands ROCK!"}

{"text":"This place shut their doors, the food probably was not great at all. Service was not good anyway from people I know that went there. Business is Closed"}
{"text":"Such a great location for me and a fun little sports/dive bar. They have cheap pool, darts and video games and a nice little outdoor ghetto patio. They even have live music. I just wish you didn't reek of pee, rank beer and bleach :( I usually show up drunk though so the initial shock of the smell reeks havoc on my senses but then curls up in my nose, gets comfortable and I get used to it. The food is food, and I liked the sliders on mini croissant rolls. I've had a lot of fun here and would definitely recommend it as a last stop on the way home or for a game."}
{"text":"This is a large sports bar and a great place to hang out during the week or for happy hour -- grab some pub grub, play trivia, or maybe golden tee... and watch a game!  They have several pool tables too. Expect a very casual, blue-collar crowd for the most part.  This place gets busy if a big game is on. They have another bar in the back which seems to be closed most of the time - I think they use it for special events like live music, karaoke, and poker tournaments."}

The waitress and bartender know me by name (maybe I shouldn't brag about that)  I go here some Mondays and alot of Thursday's to play a round of free Texas Hold 'em Poker hosted by Pioneer Poker.  It's a great way to meet people and play some cards without being under the pressure of gambling.  Try it out sometime.  Also the stage is pretty good.  They have a good blues man who plays traditional blues on Thursday nights.  I saw a comedy show here once too and it was decent.  At least is was something new."}

{"text":"Ewww.  This place is pretty gross.  I've been here once, and hope to never have to go there again.  Their 'patio' area is just a big smokers den - with ashes all over the seats and tables.  The interior smells funky and I had to wait at the empty bar for about 10 minutes to order my beer...not sure what took the bartender so long since I was the only customer at the time.  My friends lured me here in order to watch a volleyball game, promising cold beverages while watching some fun tourney action (there is a vollyball court out back).  What they failed to mention is that it's not actually part of the bar, so the frosty beverages were enjoyed(?) by myself within the barred enclosure of the patio while my friends sat on the grass about 50 feet away.  Good times I hope not to repeat."}
{"text":"Had the Philly sandwich here and was remarkably impressed for a local place. A bit \"divy\" looking but the food was good"}
{"text":"It's hard for me to review this place because I've never been to the first one, only the sequel.  I went here for a Seahawks game once.  They were able to get my game on one of their tiny TVs, meanwhile the 49er game was on two GIANT TVs. There was some Patriots fan there that kept yelling and clapping for his team, but he was the only Pats fan there.  I think they have a strange system for their waitresses- we were constantly asked if everything is okay and if we wanted food after we had already ordered.  Usually places assign one waitress per table.  We had four."}
{"text":"We went here to watch the Kansas/North Carolina game a few Sundays back. Everything was okay until it came time to leave. The credit card I'd given the waiter to start the tab was nowhere in sight, nor was the waiter. He'd actually slipped out earlier so we'd had spotty service most of the time we were there, but I just figured it was a shift change. I immediately called my card provider and learned that my card had already been used for a fraudulent transaction.   The waiter that had taken over our table let me know that they would be discounting our bill 50% to account for one of their staff robbing me. I informed him that was unsatisfactory and requested to speak with the manager. Someone claiming to be a \"manager\" arrived with a lackadaisical attitude and an unwillingness to actually try and fix the situation. I told her to get the owner. Someone claiming to be an \"owner\" also arrived with a lackadaisical attitude, but after raising my voice to him I thought we'd reached an agreement that nothing would be charged to us. I left without signing any credit card slips and made it explicitly clear to him that any charge from Pranksters Too was unauthorized.  Somehow the account for the stolen card posted a charge from Pranksters Too, however.   It goes without saying (but I'll say it nonetheless) that if a patron can't trust an establishment at such a fundamental level, the establishment needs to evaluate its own existence. The management and owner clearly need a refresher course on basic customer service skills. On the other hand, though, if they don't understand that stealing is wrong perhaps going back to preschool would be more appropriate."}
{"text":"I haven't been to pranksters in along time. I use to visit quite frequently when I lived in the area years ago.   My friend and I were hungry, and since we were in the area and reminiscing about all the times we have had at pranksters we decided to stop in.   First off, the decor hasn't change. Still a very large dive bar with plenty of places to sit. They have added on site betting which is kind of cool but we didn't par take.   I'll start with the good, the guy and girl (she came on a little after us being there) working were actually really nice, I didn't catch their names though. The food is still awesome like I remember it would be so def an A+. Mozzarella sticks are soooo good, and still fresh salads.   For the bad.... well when you come into a place you kind of want to be greeted in some sort of a reasonable time. I think we sat for about 15 mins before anyone came out from the back. I actually walked around trying to find someone thinking maybe they were outside or in the back room. It's just frustrating when you are hungry, thirsty and there's no one there. I get that maybe some of the regulars don't care but with other places to choose from in the area I guess it makes you question where I'd go next. His excuse was his was talking to the boss. If you only have one employee on working the front maybe talk to them out of the way of guest but still can see them? Also, he kept pushing more beer about 4 times when I said I live in Mesa and he remarked\"I'm trying to upsell.\" Well, you might be trying to upsell but I'm trying to get home safely.  I can't give this place anything less than a 4 because it's still somewhere I love to go."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food! I wasn't expecting much from this divey bar but always friendly service, cheap drinks and tasty food!"}
{"text":"We were riding our bikes today and stopped by to do some off track betting. We walked in and the 1st thing to hit you is the smell....omg....what is it? I mean, we almost turned right around and walked out. There's a dead body rotting in there, I think. But....otb was calling so we stayed. Drinks were strong, cheap and the staff was friendly. We didnt eat but the menu is extensive and they have daily specials. That smell though...."}
{"text":"NO AMBER ALE??? NO AMBER ALE!!!  Wow, okay. And you call yourself a bar. Your Web site boasts all these beers you offer, on tap or by the bottle. What a f'n joke. Oh, I get it. Is this another prank? Seems to be the worst one possible. I mean, sure, you offer plenty of make-me-puke domestics to satisfy any obese truck driver, but what about little ol' me who's just looking for a nice amber to enjoy during HH?   I was snubbed.   This place is pretty large, I'll give 'em that. There's plenty of TVs to watch, while you nosh on cheap (and I do mean cheap!) apps during HH. My friend and I split the veggie tray (huge!) and Cajun chicken sliders on mini-croissants. (Good but kind of plain and dry.) The RED SEOX game was on a huge TV screen. Very cool! There wasn't any sound on during any of the games, until it was time for the Suns to play. Then most of the TVs went to that game and the sound came on. So, NOTE TO SUNS FANS: This could be a very good place to watch a game, while enjoying traditional bar food and a brewski (or several).  The patrons are what I'd call mostly \"blue collar.\" Nothing wrong with that. They are some of the hardest working people, who are friendly and offer the best tips. I grew up around these kinds of folks. I felt pretty comfortable here, but I was with a friend. I highly doubt I'd venture here solo, for nothing screams \"open hunting season\" like a young, pretty girl sitting at the bar by herself. And I couldn't say, \"Oh, I came for the amber ale...\" Blue Collar Chilvary isn't the same in Phoenix as it is in Oklahoma... (trust me on this one)  Moving on...  Service was great. We had three attentive servers check on us during our short HH stay. My friend and I split a mini-pitcher of Blue Moon for $5. Yeah, I told you this place was cheap. If we had a DD, I'm sure we could have polished off another $10 worth!  Between 2 apps and 1 mini-pitcher AND tip, I spent around $13 here. Maybe that makes me cheap? I'd prefer to think of it as frugal.  While this place offers TVs galore and even a separate area for games (arcade-style included), I didn't find much about this place that would warrant a return trip. It would be a fun place for a group of friends to hit up during HH (if you're frugal like me and want to get alot of bang for the buckaroo) to order mini-pitchers ($5!), while challenging each other to various game competitions. Will the Real Big Dog please stand up?   I can't believe they didn't have an Amber Ale... They did offer two Hefs and an array of others, including Kiltlifter for those who like your local red ale. But - GASP - while the place was decorated with all types of beer merchandise and empty 6-pack boxes adorned the tables with condiments, Prankers Too did not offer any Sam Adams. NONE!   There went Plan B... (grumble, grumble)  So, no Amber Ale. No Sam Adams.   One more strike, and you're out of here!"}
{"text":"This is a great dive bar. It's in a strip mall, so there's plenty of parking. There are tables and TVs everywhere so if you want to watch a game, you should be able to get a good view.  Drinks are reasonably priced. It's bar food, but it's decent. Frings basket is a safe way to go (onion rings and fries). Nachos are a bit greasy; I would skip them in the future. Chicken sliders were pretty simple but safe enough in terms of flavor. Wings were better than I thought they would be. I would order wings again.  The staff are friendly, and there's a room where they play live music. I'd be willing to see a show there featuring a local band. Also, someone had mentioned the bathrooms were scary. It wasn't the most beautiful, immaculate bathroom I've ever seen, but it was definitely better than I thought it would be.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the back of a little strip mall and looking like a sports bar - yep, that's what it is. There are TV's along two sides of the big bar area, and a patio as well. Breakfast on Sunday mornings for football goes pretty quick, so get there early. They stop serving at 11:15 am. Saw the steak and eggs across the table and they both looked good. I tried the hash browns and they were awful. I ordered the Frisco burger and couldn't have been happier. Great juicy burger with lots of flavor and delicious fries on the side. Hubs had the wings and said they were amazing. Pizza was also on our table but didn't get a lot of love. People said it was just okay. The service was okay, not stellar, but not bad either. San Tan Brewery's Railslide was the beer of the month and that's pretty amazing too. Try it."}
{"text":"Relaxed, laid back and never rushed.... Food is really good, especially the NACHOS oh wow super good...! Great prices, huge portions, comfortable, fun atmosphere can't beat that....!!!!!!!!!!"}
