{"text":"This was such a pleasant surprise!!!  Being from Houston and spending a lot of time in Louisiana, as well as having family from there, my standards for yummy Louisiana cuisine is pretty high.  This place was YUMMY!!!!  The staff was very friendly and helpful, the decor was cute and clean, and the food was full of flavor and spice. The bread on the poboy was flakey and fresh, and the red beans and rice was delicious!!!!  I will be back to try all the different items they have and look forward to feeling a little bit of home here in Vegas. Great job!!!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches were delish! We got catering for our hike at Red Rock Canyon with The Mill. Yummy and great on the go."}
{"text":"Food was really good.  I suggest the turkey with onion rings.  Delicious.  Customer service was great too."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I were looking for a new luncheon place.  What a find!  The eatery is small, but quaint.  It is definitely a casual place. You order food at the counter, and staff delivers it to your table.  The tables are painted doors with an acrylic poured top, and you sit on medium height stools.

The menu is small, but has sufficient selections to fit most eaters.  We both ordered the catfish po-boys.  A combo comes with a side and drink.  Once again, we both ordered onion straws.  The po-boy comes wrapped in a foil wrapper, with a paper dish of straws and ranch.

The catfish was nicely cooked --flaky with a light cornmeal dusting.  No grease detected!  The mayo is a tad spicy, and there is lettuce and tomato to top off the sandwich.  It comes on a light, flaky, fresh bagette type roll.  It is rather large, but so tasty you decide to throw caution and calories to the wind and eat it all!  The onion straws are like getting them at any other place, although they added extra allure to the sandwich!  I encourage you to stick then under the bread.

The staff was great.  The greeter/order taker was pleasant, and checked on us at to satisfaction and drink refills.  On the way out, the owner thanked us for checking out his restaurant.  

I have no complaints, and I recommend this place.  Next week, I can't wait to try the \"dirty\" po-boy, which is shaved roast beef cooked on site.

Check this place out if you are up for a super casual eatery in downtown LV!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go.. Never will do that again. Had there brisket sandwich and gumbo. Sandwich bread was all soggy when I got home so I only ate the inside brisket was good not great. Flavors were typical. The gumbo was very meaty which I liked but I've been to Louisiana I've ate on Bourbon St and the flavors here are very bland compared. Gumbo had no spice in it I ended up eating all the meat inside and throwing the rest out."}
{"text":"I myself am from Louisiana and have been searching for some amazing Louisiana cuisine and I have found the spot. From the Decore to all the amazing food options, this is the place to eat downtown."}
{"text":"Great po boys. Bread is amazing, seasonings just right, shrimp are crispy yet tender.  A real gem."}
{"text":"Not a bad lunch spot in Las Vegas, it is different and tries to hit the south Louisane cajun palate, but for anyone from that region, I feel it fell slightly short of the real deal."}
{"text":"We spotted Zydeco on our way to the Container Park and couldn't wait to give it a try. The counter-man let us know that they'd only been been open a week so we were happy to give them a try. 

We sampled the Cajun Turkey and a Fried Shrimp Po-Boy with Cajun Fried and Onion Rings. 

Beer, Hard Cider, Frozen Daiquiris were on the menu, but we stuck to soft drinks. 

Service was good. It's counter service, but they deliver to the table when the order is up. 

The sandwiches were really tasty--taken \"up a notch\" with the jalapeño mayo. The turkey was cut in a generous slab and was juicy. The shrimp was good, not overly generous but not stingy either. 

The fries were shoestring, hot, and perfectly seasoned. The onion rings probably came out of the fryer first, so the temperature just missed, but the flavor was good (I couldn't stop picking at them).

The restaurant is new, clean, and unique. We really enjoyed it. The total check for three sandwiches, three drinks, one fry/one ring was just under $50+ tip, which we thought was fair. 

They just miss a fifth star for the rings, shrimp portion, and the fact that we were the only people there (which could really go either way...) Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing poboys!! Authentic south Louisiana cooking, Cajun music playing, and love the decor. The poboys are even better than most places in south Louisiana. We will definitely be back - hopefully many times!"}
{"text":"Laissez les bons temps rouler!!! This place was AMAZING!!! Walked in and felt like home! Service was amazing, food did not disappoint! Gumbo was just like we were back in Louisiana! Please do not pass up this gem right by Freemont! It's worth every bite!!!"}
{"text":"What a little gem! So cute, and delish! And Abita beer!! Thanks so much for the much needed gumbo on a rainy day!!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Zydeco since it opened last month! I have had the potato salad and shrimp po-boy for lunch more times than I can count and each time it gets better and better! The vegan gumbo is delicious, too! 

They've recently updated their menu and the prices are great! $10 for a po-boy, side and a drink. 

I love the atmosphere and it's nice and quaint inside. The staff is very friendly and always full of smiles. This is one of my new favorite spots in Downtown Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We stopped by before our flight home - catfish and the sausage Poboys were both amazing.  Get the Cajun fries too - the spice is just right"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! Wonderful service and such a cute, quaint place. Will visit EVERYTIME I'm in town."}
{"text":"I am very upset i have to give this place 1 star.  I was very excited to try the po boy sandwiches and the gumbo but in the end it did not taste good at all.  No what I expected coming from a restaurant that specializes in Cajun cooking

First sandwich I order was the zydeco special.  To be honest the whole sandwich was dry.  The turkey meat was dry, brisket had no flavor the mayo and mustard helped a little but did not make up for the sandwich.

Second sandwich was the turkey cajun.. overall the sandwich did not taste good at all. Very very dry

Third sandwich was zydeco special but I ask them to add fried shrimp.  Cost an additional 6.00 wow.  The shrimp did not have any flavor at all.

Lastly the gumbo.  I have to say this is the first time ever I had gumbo that was very dissapointing. I only took 3 spoonful and had to throw away the rest.  The broth was bland... yes I said broth it did not have any gumbo type consistency.  The sausage and chicken had no flavor.  Overall the gumbo was HORRIBLE.

I might give this place a second chance but it will take a lot of convincing in order for me to go back."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for the awesome suggestion!  After tiring of sucky, expensive food on the Strip, we hit this place on the way to Downtown. Holy moly, were we glad we picked this spot! So good.  Flavorful, authentic, tasty, big portions, awesome service, and great prices make this place an all around winner.  So if you are ever near the top of the strip or Fremont St, this place is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"BEST po-boys! Just came back from having lunch at Zydeco's po-boys. We used to live in the South and these are the real deal! My son ordered the shrimp po-boy/fries and I had the debris po-boy/onion rings. Both were delicious -especially with the jalapeño mayo and the fresh bread brought in daily from Louisiana. The food was so good, we had to order both desserts: the banana pudding was amazing yet the peach pie with the whipped cream was my son's favorite! The atmosphere was authentic with zydeco music playing in the background, Louisiana college pennants on the walls and tables made out of doors (loved the tables). We will definitely be back! Thank you fellow Yelpers for the recommendation!"}
{"text":"Have visited and eaten my way around New Orleans many times and have to say that this place captures 85% of the charm, feel and flavor of that great city. I tried the special just because it has a variety of meats in it and I thoroughly enjoyed every last bite; from the tender brisket to the tasty turkey all covered in an addicting jalapeño mayo. My whole party really liked the onion rings: there were only crumbs left in the baskets. The place is on my radar and will definitely return next time I'm in town despite the place being surrounded by metered only parking."}
{"text":"I like everything about this place,  slightly off the beaten path. They did a nice a job decorating. The staff is nice.  Shrimp Po-Boy was tasty,  plenty of shrimp and a great bun. Prices are fair.  I will probably eat here a couple of times while i am vacationing."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked and was in the area. It was a cute, small place and in the middle of the afternoon, so no one was there. That was fine because I needed some alone time. The red beans, sausage & rice weren't bad although I've had better, including my own. It was on the salty side, but I like salt, so it didn't bother me. I also got their brisket sandwich, but I didn't like it. The flavors were there, the bread was decent and the meat was plentiful. The big problem was that the meat was so dry. I just hate dry meat and it seems to be a common thing at these restaurants.  People stop overcooking the meat!  I really can't see myself going back."}
{"text":"Got there at 350 pm.  Asian guy who takes orders and delivers them outside smoking. Go inside he doesn't wash hands
 GROSS....
IVE eating there many times. This guy just don't give a shit. Gal who works there usually at lunch PLEASANT and grateful for your business
 So the question is did I eat there today
 FUCK NO."}
{"text":"Yaaaaaaaaasss! Got my gumbo fix! The service was southern, warm, and I felt like I was back in Nawlins. Owner will make sure you love your food. Will definitely be back. Prob once a week."}
{"text":"In town on vacation and tried this place for the first time. 
I'm from Mobile, Alabama, so I'm familiar with authentic Gulf Coast seafood cooking. This is true Gulf Coast seafood cooking.
I picked the fried shrimp po boy. It was greatly dressed with just the right amount of messiness. 
The bread was the perfect type of bread that you want for a po boy. It was the perfect blend of hard and soft.
The shrimp were fried perfectly. However, I'd prefer a little lighter hand on the spice. It definitely opened my nostrils.
Also, had I known that the onion rings were actually onion strings, then I would have picked French fries or potato chips. The menu reads \"onion rings.\" 
This should be changed to make it clear to the customer.
However, this place has great food and service. Thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Chef Brandon really cares about his food and his restaurant guests. I'm still obsessed with the Cajun Sausage Po-Boy, but EVERYTHING he makes is DELICIOUS!!!  We added the wings onto our usual order today, and they didn't disappoint!  Boudin balls are always great when he is offering them as a special!  Every time I leave there, I spend the rest of the week thinking about the food, and planning my return!  It's really great to have such a high quality po-boy place like this in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is traditional New Orleans spiced and flavored to perfection. The daiquiris are on point, certainly better than on Fremont St., and priced just as they typically are in New Orleans. The red beans and rice, potato salad and po-boys are excellent! The decor is beautiful and the music will transcend you to the Bayou"}
{"text":"Went to try this place out before hitting up the Pride Parade because of the Yelp reviews I read, plus the food looked scrumptious! 
Yup... The majority of the reviews that praised this place was right! 
Going in, the boyfriend and I were greeted by friendly staff. The decor was cute, and suited the food theme, but it wasn't obnoxious. Hahaha... I felt tinier sitting at their tables, but it was still nice and clean. 
I asked for a recommendation on which Po-Boy to get, and I was not disappointed with the flavors in the least. Plus I think I got my money's worth ($28 with a tip) for getting the meals my boyfriend and I ordered, especially as combos. 
Let's see... I ordered the Debris Po-Boy with Cajun Fries and an Angry Orchard, and the boyfriend ordered a Ham Po-Boy with Cajun Onion Rings and a regular soda. 
I have to admit that I liked the Cajun Onion Rings better 'cause they were sliced super thin and weren't overly battered. Although the Ham Po-Boy had nice chunks of ham, the flavors in my Debris Po-Boy was amazing! Hahaha... If you're a messy eater like me, beware of the sauce that's going to drip down from the sandwich!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place for lunch! The po boy sandwiches are consistently delicious. The Debris (brisket) and catfish are my favorites, but Chef Brandon's shrimp, ham, and turkey are also excellent. The gumbo is tasty, and the potato salad is the best I've had. You can tell that this food has quality ingredients and is made with great care."}
{"text":"Debris po boy and gumbo are on point. Best I've had in vegas. I'm in here at least once a week. Worth driving for."}
{"text":"My husband was looking for a po' boy sandwich, and 5 of us (adults and teens) looked at the menu and agreed there was something for all of us. Very unique, eclectic, fun decor. Very affordable (especially in Vegas, although $5 for a bottle of beer was a bit much). We all enjoyed our food. Dirty fries, yum! Gumbo and sausage po' boy, fries were good. Shoestring onion rings too salty for us."}
{"text":"So far everything I've tried has been DELISH!  Be sure to try the in-house-made sausage on a Po' Boy or in the Gumbo! If you get a Po' Boy be sure to make it a meal (with drink & a side) for only $1.25 more! For real downhome Louisiana/cajun food get to Zydeco (Look for the multi-color sign above the door!)"}
{"text":"One is kinda limited for good Cajun food here in the west.  Not any more now that Zydeco's is open. Defiantly the best Debris Po-Boys around. You can't leave without a take-out of Gumbo. Check them out, right across from the Container Park downtown."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch this weekend, a group of us were at Fremont street taking a short break from the strip and wanted something delicious for lunch, found this place on Yelp and it did not disappoint!  Po boys were so flavorful and authentic and the owner was so friendly, he came and out and chatted with us.  The Debris Po boy and shrimp po boy with Cajun fries were fantastic!!  Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Me and hubby just enjoyed our lunch together, while recharging our Tesla across the street,  we walked in to Zydaco and was greeted warmly.  the menus are very easy to understand. It is true Cajun food. This seasoning is perfect. I love their shredded onion rings, and I had the Shrimp Basket which was incredible with a spicy cocktail sauce. Jay had a po boy and it was so juicy. thay use actual meat .... huge big chunks of fresh juicy meat. And their own seasoning and sauce the atmosphere is fantastic. the owner came over and spoke with us he custom made all of the tables and the interior is so stinkin cute. If you've never been here you need to try it."}
{"text":"This is the THE place to be if you're into paying $10 to eat a huge loaf of bread *lightly* speckled with catfish meat. Very lightly --maybe 2-3oz.

Portions / pricing is grossly out of whack. Won't return until I hear this has been corrected."}
{"text":"What better way to beat a hot downtown summer day than with a hot bowl of gumbo? The spice is just right, not too bland, and not overpowering. Need to try the po-boys next time."}
{"text":"I hope this place makes. I was never really into gumbo but now the craving strikes weekly and it was all because of this spot."}
{"text":"Tons of good reviews but I couldn't find all these amazing flavors?! Got the shrimp and sausage po boys as well as the gumbo. 

The gumbo was like water... It made me immediately regret my decision to not go to Lola's instead. The po boys were so drenched in sauce and salt my meats were crying for help! Poor guys were drowning. 

I get that everyone has different tastes, but this place wasn't for me."}
{"text":"I love all the great new restaurants popping up in this part of town! Stopped in on opening day for a poboy and was pleasantly surprised by the modern-country interior. The colorful stick-on letters for the menu and signage felt a little cheap, wonder if they're still waiting on more permanent signage?

In any case, service was polite and suggested the shrimp poboy or their daily special (today's was turkey, ham, and brisket)- all sides are extra and sandwiches range from about $10-13. Large sandwich easily feeds two, and the meats tasted fresh-cut, but the bread was ridiculously dry and falling apart. 

Wish I'd opted for the classic shrimp or debris version, as the special lacked any sort of Cajun sauce or Louisiana pizazz. Next time I'll have to add on a side of gumbo or Cajun fries. Sides are a bit pricey and sandwiches are huge, not a great place to fly solo."}
{"text":"Saw this place on a top restaurants downtown list and decided to give it a try. The po-boys are large enough to split. We got the debris(brisket) and fried catfish both tasty and worth the try! Red beans and rice were tasty and tradition. The fries were WAY too salty and soggy but the onion rings were awesome! Good batter and super thin and crispy. Staff was nice and accommodating and the restaurant itself was clean and inviting. Only about 9 tables but we came at a down time and it was just fine. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I have been thinking, and this is the worst sandwich I've ever had.  They call it a cajun link po'boy, but as there was more tomato and lettuce than meat, I'm just calling it a sandwich.

Two stars because the service managed to be excellent despite the loudest awful music I've ever heard in a restaurant.

I had three burnt pieces of meat in a sandwich that was so tasteless I would not have known there was food in my mouth except for the fact that I was chewing.

Hail to the knawl."}
{"text":"Was in town for the weekend staying at the el Cortez and stumbled upon this place, I have to say I was impressed, ordered the fried shrimp po boy, it definitely had a unique taste that is different from other sandwiches, the sauce and the cheese combination was great. I don't normally like tomato slices on my sandwiches but it is a must in this one, docked one star because it's a little pricey and I could've used more shrimp, but I was high satisfied with my meal."}
{"text":"I am not usually on this side of town, but decided to give it a try. I am so in love with their cajun fries! I did not want to stop eating it. The po boy was delicious! It was a little messy, but in the good way. I was just thankful no one watched me eat because I devoured it, but still enjoyed of course! Mmmm"}
{"text":"Based on the recommendation of a coworker from Louisiana who said it's quite good, I decided to give this place a shot. 

I took a group of friends with me today for lunch and we all really enjoyed. I went with the catfish basket, probably against my better judgment. I likely should have tried the Po boy which is what this restaurant is famous for. In any event, it was very tasty.

The catfish basket came with Cajun fries and was $9.75 plus tax. It was seasoned very well to had plenty of taste. 

The restaurant is very clean, the staff is very friendly. It's new and it's got that cool, trendy, hipster feel.

And I found out Zydeco is a type of music. 

If you haven't been, I suggest you give it a try. There isn't a ton of seating so go early if you plan to go at the lunch hour. I'll definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They actually have \"REAL\" po-boys! That means they use French bread from New Orleans. I had the shrimp po-boy with Cajun fries and my wife had the debris po-boy with potato salad. Let me tell you it was a taste of home. The food was fantastic the service was great and the Chef/ owner came out and spoke with us what a great guy. The atmosphere was nice the music right the food was authentic.The whole experience was awesome. I look forward to my next visit and will recommend Zydeco Po-Boys to all my friends."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Po boy I have ever ate.   Catfish Po boy won my heart over. The fries were perfect and the price was right on.  Please try this restaurant out.  Haven't tried everything but today was my first time and I'll be back for sure for sure. Be ready to nap after your meal because it will put you in a food coma 

So went back this afternoon after giving a cook a ride and tried the Gumbo and Potato salad.   Mind blowing!!!   Please try this place out. Small business and great people.  High quality food and great service always."}
{"text":"One word...WOW!!!!!
Definitely a taste of home...Highly recommend.
Great excuse to come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Shrimp po'boy is my favorite! I love the decor and the cute menu board, I hope they keep it that way."}
{"text":"Tasty and authentic Cajun cooking served with a smile. Great gumbo, beans and rice, Cajun fries and shrimp poboys. Very clean and quite stylishly decorated for a Cajun restaurant. And for you Tesla owners, it's right around the corner from the supercharger! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Everything is fresh and homemade. I ordered the cajun turkey po-boy with cajun fries and my friend got and my friend ordered the debris po-boy with potato salad. Eveeythong was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Most of my po boy knowledge comes from
mothers in New Orleans. I can't stop eating at Zydecos. I think it's better than New Orleans! I love the debris po boy and banana pudding. It's perfect! This place is absolutely worth coming to!"}
{"text":"Purse hanger under the table, how cool is that!!Very friendly staff, quiet atmosphere, great food  what more could you ask for.  It was great. Clean friendly, great food. Awesome lunch spot. Very cute place, nice and clean.  Will definitely be. Sick. Catfish plate awesome,.po boy zydeco my husband said was delicious. And there is a purse hanger under the table!!!! How cool is that."}
{"text":"Love the food! Very fresh and tasty. An added bonus......a purse hook on the tables..awesome!!!! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Tried to get a seat at Carson's, and they wouldn't give us a 4 top even though they were not at all full.  Serendipitous Luck!!!  We went down to Zydeco and LOVED it.  I am a foodie, my wife, not so much.  She said it was the best sandwich she ever ate and kept enthusiastically commenting on the flavors.  This is not my wife's normal reaction to food!!  I am always the excited one, good or bad.  This may explain why she is fit and I, not so much.  

She had the Turkey Po-Boy.  Really nice mix of flavors, spicy and sweet perfectly balanced.  I had the Cajun Sausage Po-Boy and one bite in, I knew this was special.  Again, a perfect balance of flavor.  Why so great?  The chef makes his own sausage on premise!!  For just $1.50 more we each got the combo which included free refills for the soda fountain and a generous portion of either Cajun Fries, Onion Straws or Cajun Potato Salad.

I couldn't resist adding a small Gumbo, which we shared.  Again, this guy knows how to balance flavors.  Wonderful!!

It's rare one gets generous portions of great food.  This place does it!!  I cannot recommend this place enough!!  It is a wonderful sandwich shop with lots of extras!!"}
{"text":"Great food! The catfish po-boy is very good, fresh, crispy catfish. A little spicy but well seasoned. Onion rings are sweet and delicious. Heading back to try the Gumbo but definitely going to be a regular for lunch."}
{"text":"Discovered by accident and LOVED it!
Had the Cajun sausage. One of the best things I ever ate.
Owner is very personable, too. Really enjoyed our conversation with him."}
{"text":"Authentic Cajun Cooking! Love to get my Poboy on! Try the catfish, onion rings and a daiquiri!!!
You can't really go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Zydeco Po-Boys is hands down one of the best Cajun restaurants in Vegas. Their gumbo, po-boys are legit. If you want authentic tasting food from South Louisiana then this is your place. FYI, they are now open on Sunday's."}
{"text":"Awww, closed already? This was a sparkling clean and modern venue just off Fremont Street that, while appearing just a tad spendy on the surface, served excellent, super-stuffed po-boys, like the fried shrimp that I had. They also had a handful of other Southern-inspired offerings like gumbo and sausage, beans, and rice platters. 

But gosh, those po-boys were super good and well worth it. RIP, Zydeco."}
{"text":"When you crave a Po-Boy, this is the place to go. I was downtown the other day and have been wanting to try this place. I was by myself so there was no debating about where to have lunch. I ordered the Shrimp Po-Boy with onion rings. The shrimp were nicely fried, loaded onto a roll with lettuce, tomato and remoulade. As for the side... I thought I would only eat a few to find out I wish I had more, thin, crispy and loaded with flavor. 
There were many other items on the menu that I am looking forward to on my next visit."}
{"text":"The best fried shrimp po-boy I've had outside of New Orleans! I've been super excited for Zydeco to open, and I'm so relieved it not only met my expectations but surpassed them! The menu is small but expertly curated, and offers a selection of po-boys and delicious gumbo, including a vegan option! 

The bread is PERFECT- doughy, fresh, not too thick, and the shrimp was seasoned expertly and fried to a crisp but still juicy inside. I loved the spicy mayo, and was delighted to see a bottle of crystal sauce on the table. The sandwich comes with a pickle, and for a small surcharge you can add Zapp's chips (bbq or jalapeno) and a drink to your meal. 

The decor is really inventive and hip, but still comfortable. It's not huge, but a small and relaxing place to escape for a nice lunch. I love it so much!!!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are very good and unique, love the shrimp and cat fish sandwich, the onion rings are thin and full of flavor the best in town, the place is ultra clean and new!!"}
{"text":"Great service!! Great food! Fast! 
Ordered gumbo, & po boy, Cajun fries, onions rings to go. Guy was friendly my food was packed perfectly! The food smelled delicious! Tasted even better!!!"}
{"text":"This place has best chicken and sausage gumbo in the city hands down nothing even comes remotely close. His Cajun sausage is homemade."}
{"text":"It's all about the bread! 

Zydeco Po-Boy is a fairly new spot added to the food frenzy that is Downtown Las Vegas. This place has the look and vibe of eating on the bayou, well I'm just assuming this because all I really know about the \"bayou\" I learned from, \"All Dogs Go To Heaven\". 

The menu is filled with all sorts of Southern dishes; two types of gumbo (sausage and vegan) seven types of po-boys, and of course red beans and rice. Right as I walked in, the smell was intoxicating, I'm pretty sure a fresh batch of fried something had just come out and hooked me. I went with Fried Shrimp Po-boy with a side of Cajun Fries.

The sandwich was a little on the small size, but along with the fries it was the perfect lunch. The fried shrimp were plump and crispy, but I could have used a few more on the sandwich. The bread was ridiculous, super soft with a slight crunch that and seemed to almost melt in your mouth. I did some research and found out that this bread comes straight from a New Orleans based bakery that's been in business for over a 100-years and I can see why. The sandwich was loaded with flavor and is definitely worth trying on first trip here. 

The Cajun fries were good and had a slight spice, but I still covered them in hot sauce. Next time Dirty Cajun Fries are in my future. Zydeco offers great service and a welcoming place to hang and eat some of the Bayou's best!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place. The PoBoys are really good. Make sure you get the onion rings with your order. Menu is simple and nothing is too complicated."}
{"text":"Was walking by catching some Pokemon LOL, and we decided to stop. The Debris (pot roast po boy) was amazing!! The meat is so juicy and tender. The potato salad was fantastic! Great place for a quick work lunch if you're in that area. Service was wonderful!

Will be back!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Zydeco during a slow time. It was really quiet and the owner was in the dining area working on his laptop. We each ordered a sandwich, gumbo, and one of the slushy drinks. 

The food was really great, especially the po boys. We got beef and the meat was seasoned really well and the portions were plenty. I spent a few years in the gulf area and have been to Louisiana and this food tasted really authentic. The drink was tasty and strong. It wasn't too syrupy and definitely a nice touch to have those on tap. There is also a wall full of different types of hot sauces for you to try. 

Towards the end of the meal, my husband decided to pop in next door for a haircut and I finished my meal and drink alone. The owner struck up a conversation. He was incredibly nice and approachable. We chatted about where we were from and our favorite local restaurants. He told me about his past experience as a chef in other restaurants and about how he was actually from Louisiana. He even made a few recommendations of other local places to try.

The food here is delicious and affordable, the location is central and the owner is really kind and community oriented. Definitely think about supporting this local small business. We need more places like this to stick around!

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Super place. Went to a play at Art Square and looked for an inexpensive place with good food nearby. What a find. The ladies had salads- with some jalapeno bits thrown in, I thought a nice touch. Had the spicy ranch dressing with is great. Guys had gumbo and both thought delicious. Shared an order of Cajun fries. Delic.
Next time would try vegan gumbo and spit a salad or try the po boys and share a salad.
The eating area is small with nice bright yet cozy feeling.
Met the owner who really takes pride in his food and his restaurant.
Will come back for sure.
The area on Carson is all revamped and really nice."}
{"text":"What an awesome Cajun restaurant. I had the shrimp po boy and chicken sausage combo and exceeded my expectations. The spice and flavors were perfect and looking forward to my next visit to try everything else on the menu! You can instantly tell the chef cares about his Louisiana trade as soon as you take your first bite. Coming back soon with friends so they can enjoy as well"}
{"text":"Omg!!! This food was fucking amazing!!!! I got the shrimp poboy and the loaded frys with all that cheese and sausage seasoned to perfection with a lil kick of heat. Fuck me. I will be stopping here everytime im downtown. My friends will love this place. Very clean. Great service. Outstanding food. Perfect place."}
{"text":"Good service and pretty awesome food! Catfish po-boy was pretty good! Excited to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"The owner personally came out to greet us and gave us the run down of the menu and prep..what a great guy! The decor is hella cool and super clean! Our food was terrific! Best gumbo and vegan gumbo EVER!!! I've tried alot of gumbo and yhey always have that canned tast to them this is not one of those ! Hoooeeey! It was yummoh! We will definitely be back! And those onion \"rings\" loved!!!!aa"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place totally by accident. Wow! We were both blown away. They make their own sausage and the gumbo is so full of flavor. I had the shrimp po boy- shrimp was fresh and crispy, bread was toasted perfectly, sauce was light and flavorful. Potato salad had a nice kick to it. My guy got the gumbo, which was amazing, and he also got the dirty cajun fries, a must try! Everything was full of flavor and spot-on delicious. So glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food....the best Poor Boy we've had since visiting New Orleans.  You really need to yry the dirty fries, they are amazing."}
{"text":"Its a quick fix for some creole, but I wish they had my favorite Ettoufe. Nice location and nice area, also a great downtown!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch super yummy the po boy was yummy and the dirty Cajun fries were bomb a little small but super cute inside"}
{"text":"While shopping at the outlet on the Northside, I worked up a craving for a po boy! Yelped a few nearby places, and found Zydeco's. 

Considering its location (downtown LV) I didn't know what to expect. Nonetheless, I still wanted to give it a try. 

Upon entering Zydeco's, it was very clean and welcoming. They had a limited selection of po boys, which was good because their overall menu wasn't overwhelming. My wife and I order a shrimp and a catfish po boy...and boy were they good! They well well seasoned, and very fulfilling. The price was very reasonable for the amount of food you get. To be very honest...the po boys here tasted way better than the ones I had in New Orleans!

I had a brief moment to chat with the gentleman who appeared to be the owner, and he was also a very nice guy. He made sure all of his customers were well take care of.

I'll definitely be back again, whenever I'm in town. I'd highly recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"The best Po boy shrimp sandwich I had ! Love the veggie gumbo too! Will come back with friends!:)"}
{"text":"After going downtown for another restaurant for lunch I ended up here (other place doesn't say when it closes so I'd already paid for parking when they were closed at 415pm on Saturday:/ apparently DTP restaurants are hit or miss across the board)
Zydeco was good but room for improvement 
Agree with reviews of the place and chefs charm, also that pricing and portions are substandard for Vegas however that seems to be another DTP restaurant thing? I had turkey sandwich and found it pretty bland except for the mustard which wasn't Cajun as expected rather typical spicy brown. My bread was good.
What blew me away in flavor was the vegan gumbo I sampled and the full order of beans with sausage and rice. Hope they decide to expand on their beans to include vegan too. Will definitely return for those items if looking for quick bite for lunch in area again, however that's likely less and less between outrageous parking fees and traffic/tourists there's too many more convenient options for locals"}
{"text":"What a great lunch break from a working lunch working at The Mill in downtown las vegas. The sandwiches are amazing and hearty with a sauce that is very reminiscent of actually being on Bourbon street. Stop by and get some of their great food, It's a great addition to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Fantastic Cajun food! Catfish basket is the best buy.....have it once a week!"}
{"text":"This is a great cajon sandwich spot a block off Fremont St. the po boys are awesome. The bread is just like in the south. I had fried chicken po boy and it was crispy and served on the great bread with mayo, tomato, cheese, and lettuce. It was a crunchy and delicious experience. The red beans and rice and gumbo are both good. Pro tip: Look for a pickle hidden in your sandwich wrap. 

Good service and clean place."}
{"text":"10 dollars and some change for a po boy drink and fries is a really great deal and this is also really great food. i got a catfish po boy and the catfish was crispy and moist. im a huge fan of cajun/Louisiana food so its always cool when new restaurants open up. give this one a try and support local businesses"}
{"text":"Great little place in downtown and really great food. Chef is the owner and he knows what he doing. Gumbo soup is something you really have to try. Like the texture and the taste. All the sandwiches has rich bold taste. Specially fry catfish sandwich is my favorite. Highly recommended.  Decorations in the place are very contemporary."}
{"text":"Nice surprise!  Visiting with friends in Vegas - what a great local place.  Friendly, helpful owner, tasty food.  Wish  I could get an order of onion rings right now.  If I  lived in Vegas I'd go there often.  A hidden gem for sure."}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch at Zydeco.  We had come once before on a Sunday to find they were closed Sundays.  This time, we picked a Thursday and met a 1 PM.

We each ordered a po-boy planning to split and share so we could taste more than one kind.  I chose the cajun sausage and my friend chose the fried shrimp.  The woman taking our order wanted to know if we wanted that as a combo which gets you onion rings, fries, or potato salad and a drink.  We chose the combo for the extra value rather than ordering the items separately.

We took our drinks to the room adjoining the ordering area and waited for the po-boys.  It wasn't long before a server brought the sandwiches to us.

I liked both but my favorite was the cajun sausage.  It had some heat to it.  The shrimp was OK but they were small fried shrimp with a bit of cajun like flavoring on them.  The fries and onion rings are OK.  The standout here is the bread.  It's Leidenheimer's bread and it makes the sandwich.  Without it, the sandwiches would be less than OK.

Zydeco is an OK place if you're in DTLV but it's not a place I'd go out of my way to get a sandwich.  There are other better choices albeit they won't be po=boys."}
{"text":"Prices are high, and sand which was a little dry. Still an awesome concept for downtown. The fry basket is HUGE. Had the shrimp po boy and friend had the cat fish. Maybe specials would be a good idea."}
{"text":"I had the debris po'boy and cajun fries. I'd read that \"debris\" is \"shredded roast beef that's been moistened with pan drippings and/or simmered extra long\". Well, the sandwich was very beefy and flavorful, and the fries were nice and spicy. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This place has heart & soul. The aromas alone will  make you feel like you're in New Orleans. Gumbo is epic. The menu isn't large but everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"This food is authentic and delicious! Good prices, great flavor, and the decor is really cute. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went here the other day with little expectations. I was blown away by the food! The debris and catfish sandwiches were amazing, let alone the new prices for the combos. Don't leave without getting the Cajun onion rings. If you're familiar with Lucille's BBQ, it's on another level. And ask for Kelvin he gave the best service ever and he's such a cutie heheh. I don't normally write reviews but I had to go out of my way to write this one. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This Gulf Coast girl is proud to say that this place is legit. Once you step through the doors you forget that you're in Las Vegas and immediately feel like you're back in Louisiana. Zydeco music, the hot sauce wall, and pennants from every Louisiana college help set the scene. (Even one from my alma mater Southern University in Baton Rouge. Thanks!!) This place is small but cozy and the food is delicious. Across my 2 visits here I tried the banana pudding, gumbo, red beans & rice, and catfish po-boy. All of them were delicious and reasonably priced. The po-boy was probably my favorite. They also make their own sausage. Definitely worth stopping in!"}
{"text":"Had the gumbo, tasted good. Thought prices were a tad high but it was close to Work In Progress. Also, comes off the stove boiling so a huge first bite is not recommended."}
{"text":"Best fast food Cajun spot in Vegas! After being open only a couple days I'm hooked. Try the chicken and sausage gumbo. Yummy!

Chef Brandon is a great chef and courteous host. 
All of the employees there are professional and accommodating.

Their decor is original and really neat!! Great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Nicely spiced catfish po-boy with hearty red beans and rice and gumbo. Paired with an Abita beer, we had a great lunch at this unpretentious spot downtown.  Staff was pleasant and helpful.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best gumbo I've had in ten years! I've tried all of the so-called \"best gumbo\" all over California (LA/OC/SF) and it's all glorified chicken soup with rice thrown in. 

GUMBO: This place has smokey sausage that infuses the bowl. The chicken is tender and the broth is rich and brown, but not thick.  

POBOYS: We had the tender, juicy brisket. I appreciate that they use high quality provolone that you can actually taste the flavor. They also use a very subtle and tasty habañero mayo.

Great comfy, Cajun atmosphere. Everytime I come to Vegas, I'm coming HERE!"}
{"text":"Experience:  Came with a group of friends to try this place out. I've been holding off to go with my friends, but being a Louisiana gal, I was itching to try this spot since it first opened. It was 6pm on a Thursday. 

Facility: This place is pretty small. It has about 12 seats in the front room where you order, and maybe 12 more in the second room. It has some cool Louisiana decor, including the colleges' banners and even some of the interstate signs. They even have a Tabasco plant right on the counter. Brought me right back home. And I LOVE they put purse hooks under every seat! 

Service:  When you enter, you order from the counter, and then they bring it out. Since I was a bit early, I was asking a lot of questions, and Brandon the chef/owner came out and talked to me. He was super friendly and you can tell he takes pride in what he does. He had me taste a few things and talked to me about his journey to this particular restaurant. What a nice guy!!!

Food: There was so much I wanted to try, I was thankful one of my friends decided to order with me and split stuff so we could taste more. 
My standout favorites was the: 
Catfish Poboy - 5/5 - which was crispy and moist inside, which a nice flavor on the batter. 
Onion Straws - 5/5 - they were thin, slightly sweet and salty, and fried to perfection. 
The other things we tried...
The Chef had me try some of the Vegetarian gumbo (4.5/5) and I was surprised how much flavor it had. Not sure that it tasted like a traditional gumbo, but it was a damn good soup. 
Regular Gumbo - 3.5/5 - it was good, lots of meat and veggies, but I'm used to a gumbo with a darker roux. 
He is from an area Southwest in Louisiana, so he admitted the flavors are a little different from some of the New Orleans flavors. 
Sausage Poboy- 2.5/5 - unfortunately the sausage was overcooked and very dry. The flavor was good.  The chef makes this andouille from scratch. 
Dirty Fries - 3/5 - so these were covered in cheese and sausage. They were good, but the sausage was overdone again. 
Potato salad - 2/5 - I did not care for this much. Not saying it's not good, but I'm a southern, eggs, mayo, relish, etc kinda potato salad girl. This has a heavy brown mustard flavor. Just not my thing. 

Overall: I will come back to get a catfish Poboy and some Onion straws!  They were Yum!  Definitely the best catfish I've had in Vegas so far.  Plus I like being around Louisiana folks!  LOL!"}
{"text":"I came here Friday for an extended lunch with some coworkers and loved it! 

I ordered the Cajun turkey po' boy as a combo with the onion rings. The sandwich was HUGE! I only could eat half and saved the other half as leftovers. It came with a spicy mayo and I also added some of the house hot sauce. Delicious! The onion rings were great too. They're the small delicious stringy kind. 

The service was outstanding! They constantly asked if we needed anything and offered drink refills. Very small business homey type feel.

I will certainly be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Really good all the way around.  We tried the red beans and rice, the gumbo, the fried shrimp and the banana pudding.  All was terrific!  Super happy this place exists, great southern/Louisiana cooking in Vegas."}
{"text":"Tried the gumbo.Being from New Orleans. Well it was pretty bad. They were pricey for what we got and it didn't taste good. We there half of it in the trash. They seem like good people but the food we got really sucked. I don't think well be going back there."}
{"text":"If you're in the area and looking for reasonably priced food with a little Southern touch, this is the place to go. Theres a little something for everyone on the menu, the food is good, the atmosphere is relaxed and the staff is friendly. The tables have little hooks underneath to hang your purse or coat and you can even catch a game on the flat screen."}
{"text":"I wish I knew about this place before it was getting ready to close down. I read an article that Zydeco was closing, so I made it a point to give it a try before it was too late. The menu is simple, the dining area is small, and the food is the superstar. I normally prefer jambalaya (which isn't on their menu), so I had to settle for gumbo. The gumbo had so much flavor and kick. The heat didn't overwhelm the dish and the flavors had great balance. It was simply a great meal."}
{"text":"Their Po Boy is excellent, I've had the Sausage and the catfish and they are delectable!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch with a few friends. We had turkey, catfish, shrimp, and sausage poboys around the table. Everybody was happy with their sandwiches. I had the Cajun turkey and it was very tasty. Great fresh turkey brined in house with what looked like some spicy rub crust. Spotless place with very friendly staff and great service. Zydeco music playing at a perfect volume so you could still talk. Combo was a great deal. Didn't get to have one but they had a few tasty Arbita beers available. We will be back."}
{"text":"My coworker and I tried this for lunch today and it was really good. I got the Shrimp Po'boy with a side of potato salad and she got the Dirty Cajun fries. Everything was seasoned really well and had a little kick to it. I am always very skeptical about potato salad but theirs was amazing, it didn't have a ton of mayonnaise and it had some spice too. We are always looking for new places within walking distance to eat and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my mother in law. Cute and comfortable and pleasant young lady behind the counter. Great lunch and worth the drive if your craving a  shrimp po-boy! Will be back!!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and absolutely fell in love with this place. We moved here from Louisiana 3 years ago and have been looking for a place to find \"GOOD\" Louisiana food. Well, today we did. We had the Chicken and Sausage Gumbo and the Boudin Balls and both were simply amazing. A perfect taste of home that we were looking for.  The staff was great and the chef came out and even answered a few questions we had. He also came back out to make sure the food was to our liking once we got it. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"I went to po-boys with friends. We ordered to go and walked nearby to eat. One friend mentioned that her po-boy was on the cold side. I didn't think anything of it. She cut into the catfish and asked if anyone thought it looked undercooked to her. I didn't think much into her statement but was secretly relieved that she got the bad one and not I. 

Next, I opened mine. Sadly, I came to the same conclusion. The po-boy was cold and clearly undercooked. It is alarming that we received two separate orders with under cooked catfish. 

I'm going to play it safe and stay away. I paid $12 for catfish and $4 for fries when I could pay $10 for both at Lola's. There's no way I can go back or recommend after such an experience. I hope others have the opportunity to read before wasting your money, stomach, and time."}
{"text":"I was so excited to discover this little gem downtown. I LOVE po-boys but have yet to find any good places here in Las Vegas until I stepped foot into Zydeco on Saturday this past weekend.  The restaurant is pretty small, but everything in it was designed and handmade by the owner and chef. The tables are doors that he sanded down and painted. It's just super cool to see all the detail that was put into every inch of the restaurant, including the food!

I ordered the shrimp po-boy, and fiance ordered the Zydeco special. We also got a small order of dirty cajun fries.  My po-boy had an abundance of golden fried lightly breaded shrimp with just a hint of spice. The bread had a nice crispiness to the outside and tasted so fresh.  It was like heaven in my mouth with every bite. The Zydeco special was almost as delicious. The combination of ham, turkey and brisket with the delicious jalapeno mayo was amazing.  The fries are skinny cut (similar to Mickie D's) and come smothered in cajun sausage, carmelized onion and cheese. I mean, need I see more?! You would also expect that maybe they would get soggy under all of that, but they were stayed fresh, hot and crisp. The size small is also not so small. We couldn't finish it because we were so stuffed.

I could eat here every day if I was closer to downtown (I'd also probably have to work out a whole lot more). The food is on point, the atmosphere is bright and cheery, and the staff is so nice and friendly. You may even get a hello from the chef if they're not too busy."}
{"text":"\"Jambalaya, crawfish pie, and filé gumbo...\"

I came across this cool little eatery during a 5K in downtown Las Vegas. I couldn't wait to share the news with my friends and family considering I was born in Louisiana and remember my mother referencing Leidenheimer French bread often.

I dined in 3.28.16

*I ordered a Shrimp Po-Boy and it was pretty delicious. The shrimp were seasoned great and the sandwich was even better after adding some mayo.

*Shrimp Basket

*Gumbo was decent. The sausage in side was tasty.

*Red Beans were hands down the best item of all things ordered. The flavor reminded me of my mother and that's a good thing!

**The Catfish basket definitely deserves some improvement. I did not care for the small extra crunchy awkwardly shaped catfish pieces at all. The flavor was okay but I honestly felt as if I was eating the left over pieces that you usually toss after frying a fresh batch. The onion rings were pretty amazing though!!!! ***
 

Nearly $80 later;I probably wouldn't  return but I did enjoy my daiquiris and the overall experience. The owner was very pleasant and my folks enjoyed conversing with him!"}
{"text":"Stopped in just because we were walking by. Enjoyed the atmosphere very clean, cute decor.  Zydeco special po boy, cajun fries, and a small gumbo between 2 people and we were stuffed with some left over.  Gumbo was great only suggestion is it could stand to be a little thicker. Po boy was great,  flavor was on point."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was pleasant and friendly. I enjoyed the shrimp PoBoy and chicken gumbo also talking with founder Brandon. Great experience also awesome location when already enjoying Fremont Experience go to Zydeco PoBoys for lunch or dinner baby."}
{"text":"Zydeco delivers with flavorsome Louisianan Po-Boys, in Downtown Vegas!!!   

They have a vast menu of tasty sandwiches, I don't like to use the old cliche term \"everything looks good\" but it really does. Po Boys are filled with turkey, shrimp, catfish, or ham. 
All sandwiches come dressed with lettuce, tomato, Swiss, provolone and mayo, jalapeno mayo and/or Cajun mustard.

I ordered the \"debris\" which is a trifecta of delectable meats turkey, ham and brisket.
For starters, the quality of the bread was excellent crackly-crisp on the outside, and soft from the inside along with tender, well-seasoned meat. The Jalapeno mayo held everything like glue, it's the perfect dressing for the sandwich. I took it one step further I dipped part of the sandwich in the Louisiana hot sauce it was absolutely delicious. 

The service here is great, very nice and welcoming. 
Zydeco's has a nice the Louisiana decor, with rustic, casual seats in a counter-serve area with brick walls and large windows. They even used old wooden doors and made them into tables. 

Zydeco is one place downtown I'll be happy to return."}
{"text":"Everything there is delicious!! It's an adorable little place downtown. Everyone who works there is helpful & friendly including the owner!"}
{"text":"I grew up in the south and spent many years in Louisiana. Zydeco's chef is the real deal, and Zydeco's po' boys have made living in Las Vegas feel like living at home. I go at least once a week, sometimes more, to get a delicious debris po' boy, onion rings, and sweet tea. And don't forget to ask for some of their homemade spicy ranch!

More importantly, as a local I'm always looking for good food that isn't priced for tourist. Zydeco's po'boys cost the same as Louisiana po' boys, making it an affordable and delicious option for my downtown lunches.

Service is always above par and the staff are super friendly. Make sure you introduce yourself to the Chef. Great guy."}
{"text":"Zydeco Po-Boys is located Downtown las Vegas around the corner from Container Park and next to A Cut Above barber shop and vegenation. I don't eat southern Louisiana Cajun type food very often. When I did eat at these types of restaurants in Las Vegas, it was very High End like the Commanders Palace or Emeril's. I was excited that an eatery like Zydeco opened that is more casual, affordable and located downtown Las Vegas. When I arrived at the restaurant, the first thing I noticed was the sign, which I really like. You tend to notice neon signs when you live here. The place is very clean and well decorated. The seating is almost picnic style with long tables and steal high chairs. Each table has a hook underneath for your purse which I really appreciated. A series of hot sauces are also available as well. I ate here with my foodie group of twelve, there was plenty of room for us to sit and eat. When we arrived there was another group of about 10 before us, I thought maybe we overwhelmed the staff, they handled a crowd well and we all got our orders in a reasonable amount   of time. I enjoyed the food I ordered, the chicken and sausage gumbo and the Cajun fries were very good. I also tried to Vegan gumbo, which was also very good as well. Everyone seemed to enjoy the catfish. We were also able to chat with Zydeco's friendly, personable owner. I am happy to support this new downtown restaurant that is unique and affordable. I will return."}
{"text":"I had the chicken and sausage gumbo, and it was very flavorful ..with the cajun fries. .."}
{"text":"We got the catfish and shrimp po-boy. Pretty good, the fries are great. Loved the interior decor and the music."}
{"text":"Yummy gumbo and shrimp po boy.  I've also had their dirty fries to, and its all fabulous."}
{"text":"Louisiana has finally come to Las Vegas!!  Zydeco Po-Boys is what I needed to help me get over my cravings for some good old souther style Louisiana food.  This was my first time here and I truly enjoyed my shrimp po-boy with fries.  My po-boy was cooked to perfection.  They did not skip out on the shrimp nor the flavor.  The shrimp was lightly battered and fried a wonderful golden brown, while still containing it's moister.  The fries was cooked golden brown, with a lot of spicy seasoning, but still great.  
Overall, this place is very small and one could miss it, but it is located in a great spot.  Meter parking is located directly in front of the restaurant or across the street.  The food is amazing and you will return."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place and it met every expectation I had! The Cajun turkey po-boy was so good and to make things even better, the jambalaya and potato salad was delicious too. They carry \"abita\" brand beer which is awesome because that's from Abita Springs, Louisiana so you get even more culture with the food you're eating. I will definitely be back there soon!"}
{"text":"Such a cute environment. When you walk in, it feels like you're back in LA. I had a shrimp PO boy combo. So good and so much food! The owner was there and was so nice. Loved it! A must try."}
{"text":"As an avid food lover and supporter of the growing DTLV small businesses, I had been eyeing this place since it's construction! I only knew of one other place that served po-boys so I had high hopes for this place.

Upon walking in, I was so charmed by the ambience and design of the restaurant. The place was colorful, eclectic and earthy. I could feel some of that Southern Charm emanating from the walls. The staff was friendly and accommodating and the place was pretty busy. I even got to meet the owner Brandon who shared a charming story about how he built the custom tables in his own garage and how how he picked some of the wall designs for his ideas. But he expressed he was way more passionate about food than decor. That made me excited just thinking about how good the food must be!

I finally got my food, took a bite and was sorely DISAPPOINTED. Now, I know a thing or two about catfish, having fished for them a few times and cooked it myself. Biting into my catfish po-boy I realized my fish wasn't COOKED COMPLETELY. Deep-fried catfish is meant to be light and flaky but what I bit into was chewy, rubbery and more like eating nigiri sushi! It was TERRIBLE not to mention FLAVORLESS. In order to spare my intestines, I had to pull out most of the uncooked fish from my sandwich leaving me with just bread which was subpar. The fries we ordered were also UNDERCOOKED and not crispy! Those aren't fries those are soggy potatoes! My other friends also had undercooked fish and soggy fries. Sad to say that looks can be deceiving. 

Not to mention, the place was ridiculously overpriced. Spare yourself and go to Lola's instead for a DELISH po-boy."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The food is just average, but my biggest complaint was that I ordered a catfish Po Boy for $10, and it barely had any catfish on it. It didn't even have a whole filet but just a few pieces of what seemed to be scraps. For a $10 sandwich I was expecting more. Very disappointed. Will not be going back"}
{"text":"For being a New Orleans restaurant, and me being from New Orleans... The Red Beans and Rice was not worth it at all.  Unless you want to pay top dollar for a rice bowl with no meat. Majority of the bowl content 85% was rice.  That's not how the dish should be severed.  More beans than rice,  with some sort of meat. 

The Gumbo had chicken and home made sausage.  The chicken was good,  not enough of it. The sausage tasted like deer sausage.  It should be a pork sausage. But once again, more rice e than any thing else... With gumbo it should be more like a soup. Less rice!!!! 

On the upside,  the Shrimp Po-Boy was good and the potato salad was good as well. I would go back... My be for the shrimp Po-Boy and the potato salad. But that's if there is not another New Orleans style restaurant around. 

They are definitely over charging for what they are selling... Unless you like spending top dollar on rice. The Abita beer is ridiculously priced. For the size of the Po-Boy it's over priced. If it was bigger.  Then definitely pay the price. 

Not going good to lie,  the staff was really kind."}
{"text":"My husband and I wandered in after we finished up a teacher workshop at LVA nearby. I had the debris poboy and my husband had the shrimp poboy. Both were delicious, and so were the onion strings that came on the side. The decor was super cute and the music was fun. The tables were beautiful and so was the ambient lighting. It was super clean and spotless inside. The employees were so nice and it was apparent that they all take pride in their work. We would definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"This overpriced ass food I ordered a Red Beans with sausage and there is no damn sausage I am truly pissed and disappointed!  Never again!"}
{"text":"For the money, this place is great!  I went for lunch on a Friday and got there just in time to avoid the noon-time rush - the place was packed. I got the Debris po-boy, a nice bread roll filled with juicy, tender beef brisket, shredded greens, and a lovely sauce. You can \"Combo\" it for $1.50, giving you a soft drink and side. I chose the french fries, and they were deliciously seasoned, crispy, and bountiful. I got a very high-quality and tasty meal for under twelve bucks. Nicely done, Zydeco people!"}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviewer. 

These sandwiches are all bread sprinkled with a small amount of meat. And I mean VERY little meat. 

I had the $12.50 shrimp po-boy with a few sad and lonely shrimp. Where are their shrimp friends!!! :(  Seriously though - not coming back here.

You can go across the street to the restaurant called E.A.T. and their shrimp Po-boy is HUGE!"}
{"text":"Had the fried catfish po-boy. Definitely the best fried catfish I've had...ever. We all enjoyed the onion rings too - yum! 

The inside of the restaurant is clean and inviting, and the prices are reasonable ($10 lunch special - drink+side+sandwich). More review to come after a second visit :-)"}
{"text":"I had been dying to try this place out for a while now. I wouldn't say I was let down but it def wasn't what I was expecting. The sandwiches did have good flavor, we had the shrimp and the brisket, but the sliver of tomatoes they put on the sandwich and the tiny bit of lettuce was to light for my taste. The gumbo was good but not my favorite. Onions \"rings\" weren't rings at all but onions strings. Service was good and prompt. Cashier was nice and friendly. Place he really cute decor."}
{"text":"Zydeco was recommended by a friend & it didn't disappoint. I got the Debris and found it to be surprisingly flavorful! I plan on making this place a regular stop when I'm here in Vegas. 
Well done, Zydeco"}
