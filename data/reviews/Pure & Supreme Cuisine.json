{"text":"This is a little Caribbean/African place in the Colonial Marketplace that serves up some great food. Now I'm not a vegan, but I always leave here very satisfied. The ground nut (peanut) stew and plantain curry are both delicious, but I've gone back for the Live Salad Plate the most times. 

This salad plate has a lot of different flavors for the price. You get a salad with nice greens and veggies with a delicious creamy garlic dressing, a sliced avocado, and 3 small plastic containers of other things. These add-ons rotate occasionally. They've included an absolutely amazing kale cole slaw, plantain curry, hummus, and Carrot Supurb, a delicious carrot puree. 

The only thing I've been less than excited about was the corn muffin that comes on the side of some dishes. Since it's gluten free it's a little dry for my taste. 

Also, the people that work there are great. They are very friendly and are obviously excited about the food, and that mood is contagious. They're glad to tell you about the ingredients in any dish you ask about.

There are still a bunch of things I want to try there. The menu takes up a good sized page. In fact, I think I'll go back again today."}
{"text":"I had the salad, chickpeas, greens, muffins, and tahini shake. All were excellent.  I took away one star because the service was somewhat slow.  I thought the price was reasonable for fresh, tasty food."}
{"text":"A hidden gem!  I am a vegetarian and these guys are by far one of my favorites.  Every dish I've had, to date, has been phenomenal.  However, the kale side is truly my favorite.  I've never been a die hard kale fan - I would eat it if came in a dish, but I would never go out of my way for it - not so now.  I would eat it everyday, if I could.

I second the other comments - the plantain curry is a nice pairing of sweet and hearty; the ingredients are always fresh; the staff is very friend and definitely happy to answer any question you may have, and they really strive for low environmental impact - their containers and utensils are all biodegradable.

While the corn muffin is gluten free and a little dry, as a vegetarian, I've come to not mind it so much.  I quite enjoy breaking into smaller bite sized pieces and combining it with the other ingredients.

I'm really looking forward to trying the ground nut stew!"}
{"text":"Vegan soul food restuarant in the Colonial Marketplace food court in downtown Cleveland.  Excellently prepared, fresh offerings with daily specials.  Be sure to try the African Ground Nut Vegtable Stew and the Okra Vegetable Stew.  Both are excellent."}
{"text":"It's fresh, delicious and good for you! Let me emphasize the delicious. It was food I would be very proud to make at home, the service was quick (daily specials are usually ready to go), and I felt happy to be able to eat take-out without feeling guilty. I will make special trips to the 5th street arcades just to eat here."}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland for a 3-day conference - we went here for lunch all three days.  The people were very friendly (we were traveling with a 7-month-old baby and they made a special off-menu concoction for her, gratis), the food was excellent, the prices were low.  We tried several days worth of specials, and all were excellent.

While considering whether to eat here on the first day of the conference, a gentleman walked over to where we were staring at the menu board and started extolling all the virtues.  He showed us his meal and described each dish (that day was a peanut curry, collard greens, muffin, homemade habanero hotsauce).  We asked \"Are you vegan?\"  He said, \"No... I'm trying to eat healthier... but this place is just great.\"

We trusted him, and were quite glad we did : )"}
{"text":"This is the most phenomenal little secret in Cleveland. Each mouthful of whatever you order is a taste explosion. From the addictive taste of banana smoothie to the live salads which I also describe as a picture of beautiful colors to the daily special that Amira prepares daily. Since I am usually under time contraints I call in my order. The quality of the food has not changed since they opened. Everything is organic, fresh and devine!"}
{"text":"By far the best lunch you can get down town. It  doesn't matter if your not vegan, the food is simply fantastic!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best vegan food in Cleveland.  You can't go wrong with any of the daily specials especially Monday's joloff rice, Wednesday's curried plantain stew, and Thursday's African nut stew.  Each of these specials comes with brown rice, cooked kale, a vegetable (usually cauliflower), and a corn muffin for $7.  This is a ridiculous amount of food that most people cannot finish in one sitting.  My favorite sandwiches, the tofu philly cheese and two vegetable gluten gyros are also only $7, on whole grain pita with fresh vegetables.  I also recommend the banana tahini shake.  It is rare for a place to make delicious vegan food using such high quality and healthy ingredients for such an affordable price.  I have had most items on the menu and I love all of them... except maybe one or two deserts they don't normally have, but no place is perfect.  As far as Cleveland vegan food goes (and probably beyond), Pure and Supreme Cuisine comes closest to attaining perfection.  And yes, sometimes the wait can be longer than expected, most of the  time it isn't, but for those days that it is, I think the food is way better than most things you can get quickly (or not so quickly) so, I don't see how that can bother a person too much."}
{"text":"i went to a raw food expo in ny on 5/31 and had the food was to die for wish they were here in ny"}
{"text":"I\"m not a vegan but I like the food here the tofu  sandwich is good  and also the cheese steak is excellent you can't  believe it's not meat with there vegan cheese, grilled mushrooms,onions avocado oh it's very good I'v tried almost everything and it is all good and pure, the people that work their are nice and you can tell they put love in what they do , the wait was a about 10 min but well worth it , I was told everything here is organic, and made fresh daily  from the dressings on down to the hummus. I enjoyed the live salad plate with the tabouli and other side containers. I give this place 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"The name says it all.. so delicious, nourishing, and satisfying while feeling clean. This is one of those places that will convince you that vegan does not mean flavorless. 

The lunch special is a huge portion (2 meals for me, tastes great reheated), and is usually some sort of stew, brown rice, steamed kale and cauliflower, and a corn muffin.

Regarding the service-- if you're in a rush, opt for the daily special; the stew is already prepared. Anything else is typically made to order, so if you're pressed for time, save it for another day. But, all of that time and love definitely goes into the food... it's SO good."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious! Be forewarned, if you are going here for lunch, it will be a very long wait."}
{"text":"I've been back a whole lot. I now only order the daily special, because they have it ready and on hand. I've not had issues with the wait since my last review. 

Pure and Supreme is without a doubt the best tasting, most healthy, and best deal in down town Cleveland for lunch."}
{"text":"Okay, maybe I ordered wrong, but I'm not sure I understand the fuss.  This is a good stand in a crowded food court with limited seating. I ordered the special, which was a Dominican okra stew with kale over brown rice.  It was decent and fresh, but I'd hoped for more adventuresome flavors. The kale was well seasoned and perfectly cooked (though there were some super crunchy bits that felt like grit or something that shouldn't be there), but the okra was just meh. A bland stew without sufficient heft--it tasted watered down. It made me wish I'd ordered okra from the Indian joint across the hall.The corn bread muffin that accompanied was terrific.  Sure, the prices are reasonable, but this isn't a 5 star food stand--at least not judging by their okra."}
{"text":"Healthy feel good food! amazing holiday special Amira! the best potato salad of my life, the vegan mac and cheese is always the first to be eaten. 
Everyone must try the tahini shake! how do you get your muffins so perfect? and the yams and cranberry sauce; so delicious! Greens are perfect and the vegetables in the sateen (sp?) roast is great as well as the fluffiest mashed potatos i've ever had. The soup was so sweet and tasty; Wonderful Christmas dinner!
 Thank you so much; I am lucky to have a vegan, organic, sea salt, eatery to frequent. slow and low with organic unrefined oils; I am so happy Pure and Supreme exists! it's the only cooked food place i go out to eat. 
I wish I could cook like Pure and Supreme. The chickpea marsala is my favorite special. Go out of the way to make a gluten free menu, like qinoa tabuli instead of bulgar wheat for celiacs... Everything, just everything, including Joe, is just amazing"}
{"text":"I'm excited about food again. As a vegan, I was exhausted with my downtown Cleveland lunch options: I couldn't do hummus and pita again. \"Maybe,\" I thought, \"Maybe there's a chance of vegan General Tso's somewhere if I look hard enough.\"

I heared a voice call out and I stumbled up the Pure & Supreme counter, where a menu was pushed my way. VEGAN? Vegan food?! Delicious, fresh VEGAN FOOD? \"I've been looking for you!\" I excitedly said. With a chuckle, the guy at the couner says, \"We've been looking for you, too!\" I watch a few people order some things, making sure there really wouldn't be meat in my cheezesteak gyro (oh my, the okra special with kale looked like heaven!) and put my order in. 

My order did take awhile - a little over 20 minutes - but I can honestly tell you: this sandwich rejuvenated my love of food. Their menu described my sleection as: Vegan Cheeze Steak Gyro - Vegan roast, onions, pepper, baby bella mushroom, tomato, lettuce, avocado and house prepared cheeze. It was better than any real-meat-steak version of the sandwish I ever had. Very filling, very reasonable price [$6] and super-nice-counter-service (introducing himself, asking my name, apologizing for the wait).

Joy."}
{"text":"The first day they opened I went over to check them out. They did not have a menu available and only had two options to choose from, a $6 option and a $12 option. I didn't know what either of the two were but I like to try new things, so I picked the $6 one. Once I got my food I was told they did not accept credit cards yet... BIG disappointment. I asked the lady what it came to after tax and she said just $12. I walked away kind of in shock wondering how that got messed up? I looked in my bag and there was a plastic container about 9in. x 9in. and it had about 2 cups of what looked like salsa, and a little pinch of lettuce and hummus. I thought this was kind of...... expensive.... and showed multiple people in the Marketplace and at my job. I did not even find it that satisfying. I never went back and I did not intend to pay for what little food I received. I was highly disappointed with what I got. A few weeks later the guy who works at the counter actually came INTO my JOB and asked me to pay him. Talk about bad business, right?! I was very unhappy. I gave him the $2 CASH that I had on me and told him that is all I think it was worth. Now every time I walk by he stares at me or makes weird gestures to whoever I am with while looking at me (shaking his head, his finger, ect..) Definitely not a pleasant environment for me, but it may be different for you now that they have been open for a few months? Good luck!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place for the first time today, and while I was a little apprehensive of trying \"something different\", I am so glad that I did.  The dish I got was one of the best meals I have eaten in a long time!  I ordered the plantain stew over rice which came with a side of kale.  It was seriously delicious and I am excited to go back and try all the other menu options they have there.  It is reasonably priced, the people are friendly, and the food is terrific."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this little place in the Colonial Arcade.  I ventured into the area seeking other lunch options other than Jimmy Johns or cafeteria food and viola- I stumbled into the line next to this place!  Originally, I was turned off by their somewhat boring looking menu.  However, I saw someone else chow down on their Salad Plate and I immediately became entraced...

AND BOY AM I GLAD I DID!  Pure and Supreme focuses on raw and vegan food and normally, I am not a huge fan of raw and vegan.  I got their amazing Salad Plate.  The salad was so delicious with plenty of fresh spring mix and with a yummy scope of kale mix (its flavorful kale mix with raw olives) on top.  It doesn't even taste vegan- it's a delicious non-health food tasting salad.  The plate comes with amazing hummus (one of the top 5 hummuses I have ever ate!!).   I think the most interesting/tastiest part of the salad were the curried plantains!! let me say it again CURRIED PLANTAINS- it's a nice mix of spiciness from the curry, sweetness from the plantains, and a lightly salty bite from what appears to be a lite sprinkling of seasoning salt.  The salad also includes this white puree that I cannot distinguish- that I could do without (not bad, but not great). 

I will definitely seek out more superfood/healthy salads from this lunch place.  As good as this salad was, it was also quite expensive.  That lovely delicious super food Salad Plate was $10.00 (no meat with an adequate portion).  I get that kale is expensive, but holy cow does that much kale go into that little scoop on the salad.  The high price of the salad is a huge turn-off, along with the white puree, but everything else in that salad was so tasty!!"}

{"text":"Weird & Delicious.  

I never quite know what I'm eating, but it tastes great, and it's hearty.  And I usually feel pretty good after I eat it, which is more than I can say for Chipotle. 

I always get the daily special, which comes with their greens.  And their greens are the best thing I've ever eaten.  I don't know what kind of \"greens\" I'm eating, and I can't figure out all the flavors, but they sure are tasty.

This seems like the kind of place that would take a while to get your food together, but no!  I've never waited more than 10 minutes.  

The woman at the counter is sweet and soft-spoken, but, even if she wasn't, I'd still go here, because this food is MAGIC."}
{"text":"Holy delicious. Although downtown is packed with lunch spots, sometimes it's hard to find a place that's on the lighter, healthier side. Well I no longer have to worry, I've found my go-to spot. 
Pure and Supreme is in the food court of the 5th street arcade. It could easily be overlooked while walking through, but I was looking for it so it wasn't too hard to spot. The woman that works the counter is also the owner, and quickly informed us of the daily specials. Although we didn't get any specials this time, they sounded delicious and I will definitely try them on future visits. 
I ordered the Pure and Supreme Cuisine salad, which is a garden salad with carrots, onion, cucumber, tomato, and avocado, and served with an amazing garlic dressing. I'm not sure what was in it, definitely loads of garlic and maybe tahini? Regardless, it was awesome. I'd love to buy a bottle of that and take it home with me. I also got a corn muffin which was seriously the most moist, cakey, delicious corn bread thing I've ever had. And I washed everything down with their ginger drink- a spicy, refreshing juice they make in house! 
My boyfriend ordered the falafel wrap and he was pleased with his as well. The wrap was huge!! But was so delicious that he ended up eating the entire thing. And our whole meal was under $20... That's some serious cheap eats. 
Prior to visiting I did read a few comments about the long wait time, so I made sure to pay close attention to the clock. Our food took about 15 minutes, a little longer than some might expect, but we did not mind at all. I noticed a lot of people that had apparently called ahead and placed their orders, so I'd definitely  recommend doing that if you're short on time. 
Overall, a great lunch. Awesome food, great prices, giant portions, and the best part- feeling good about eating some organic vegan food! I have a feeling I'll soon be a regular."}
{"text":"True to its name,  the food is pure n supreme in taste and quality.  Everything was freshly made, including the falafels. The juices were great tasting and amazing fresh.  I was glad to see a menu full of veggie n vegan options!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, fresh, flavorful and wholesome food. A true treasure. You would never guess that this is vegan - no substitutions- all real food - hearty and so tasty. I got the plantain curry - absolutely delicious, and a great portion - they didn't have the kale so they made me a huge full salad with half a beautiful avocado in it and a delicious  garlic salad dressing. I also got the beet, ginger, lemon, apple juice and it was incredibly fresh and gingery. I paid 12$ total for a big portion of plantain curry with rice, a big salad, a corn muffin and a fresh organic juice. Unreal. This is my new favorite spot in Cleveland. Not to mention that they use eco friendly containers, paper straws and their open kitchen is minimal, clean and beautiful. Everyone is friendly and genuine. Everything on their menu looks incredible. I love this place."}
{"text":"This place has been on my short list of places to try, based on Yelp reviews. I'm always looking for something, light but filling in downtown Cleveland for lunch.  This fit the bill. I stopped by after the lunch time rush, and ordered the Quinoa Tabouli salad....wasn't' quite sure what to expect.  I was kind expecting a more traditional tabouli....parsley, tomatoes in lemony garlic dressing.   This was much different, but tasty.  The meal included a base salad which consisted of a nice selection of mixed greens, grated carrots, chopped tomatoes, onions, cucumbers and a 1/2 avocado.  There were separate containers of a tahini based dressing and quinoa/parsley,  I sprinkled the quinoa mixture on the salad base and then drizzled with the dressing.  This was pretty good.  Everything was fresh and the portion was just right, the price was $7 and was worth every dime.  I was a bit bummed that there were no to-go menus, but other than that, I had no complaints.   I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Similar to others' experiences...freshly made food, no problem to have to wait a few extra minutes for this. Huge veggie gyro, loaded with avadados too. Had the homemade ginger/lemon/agave water, served in a cool glass jar. Super refreshing. Love the location in the Arcade too. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Yes, it may feel like it is taking a bit long to make a salad, but what that kitchen produces is worth the wait!  I came in for lunch after the rush to try the raved about food there, and I wasn't disappointed.  I ordered the falafel salad, and what came out was filling and more than plenty to eat for lunch.  The quinoa \"tabbouleh\" was spicy and delicious, while the hummus was also remarkably fresh, though it had more texture than the super-creamy Sabra brand in the grocery store.  I skipped the dressing and just used a bit of the hummus and tabbouleh for toppings, and then dug into this fibrous feast (sorry, couldn't help it).  There was a variety of vegetables: onion, tomato, cucumber, shredded carrot and half a sliced avocado on romaine, though the star was definitely the falafel.  Oh, the falafel.  I was never the biggest fan before, but now I can admit to being a falafel lover.  These, when warm, were crispy on the outside and soft and slightly sweet on the inside.  Unlike those at some other places I've been, they were light and ungreasy, perfect to accompany a salad.  I wish I could recreate them, but my inability to do so (I don't even have a blender or food processor) and the fact that the salad did not come with a corn muffin might just call for another visit."}
{"text":"Pure & Supreme Cuisine features healthy and delicious vegan food.
The people who run it are so nice! When my girlfriend and I came here, they offered us free juice samples while we made our decision about what to order.  When we weren't sure about which soup to get, the solution was to give us a taste.
We had the vegan Cheeze Gyro sandwich and the pure and supreme salad with breaded tofu. Both meals were delicious, and pretty unique. The dressings accompanying the salad were so good I was dipping my fork in them just to taste more. In the end, all I had left from the salad was onions ...and I even ate those with the dressing!"}
{"text":"Wonderful vegan option for downtown with friendly service... I think the owner remembered me as a \"regular\" after only a second visit. 

I typically get the daily special, and that is enough to split for a couple (unless you're super hungry.) My favorite is probably the mac and cheese.  Highly recommended, but I suggest showing up early because they will to sell out of the staples by the end of the lunch rush. There can also be a long line, but just plan on showing up early and taking your time and you will be in for a treat!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!  In love this place!  Got the Monday special with adzuki beans, African rice, side of cauliflower, side of kale, and a gluten free muffin. Organic and local. I live in NJ and the food at this restaurant beats anything in NJ/NYC."}
{"text":"I don't miss meat at all!! Had a falafel salad... It's one of my favorite salads now! So fresh! Light and yet filling!! Will come back again and again"}
{"text":"Very unique, delicious, with wonderfully fresh ingredients.

This is a stand in a nice food court in the middle of the 5th Street Arcade building.   

All the daily stews and soups are extremely flavorful, with brown rice and many spices - I believe African or West Indian recipes.  The Live Salad platter is very satisfying and healthy.  The vegan \"cheeze steak\" is much healthier than it sounds, with vegan meat and avocados in place of cheese. 

A wonderful place - I just wish it were open on weekends and evenings."}
{"text":"This place is not for the hangry or impatient. 

I dropped by around 1:30 pm on a Friday hoping to pick up some grub before a 2:20 appointment elsewhere. No dice. Well, no dice for me. I was with my mom and left her behind to get my food after I left at 2:00 to go to my appointment. It took about 45 minutes for us to get our food - a salad and a sandwich.

Maybe their food is better hot/fresh, but once I got home and ate my vegan cheese steak I was underwhelmed. The pita was fresh, but I thought the seitan was salty. My mom's falafel salad was pretty good, though. 

I appreciate this place for providing vegan options in the 5th Street Arcade and I respect that they make everything from scratch. I'll just need to go back another time when I have plenty of time to kill and can afford to wait around. I'd definitely like to try some of their daily specials.  (it seems like those are dished up right away, too)"}
{"text":"As someone who's trying to add more vegetable matter to her diet, Pure & Supreme is a godsend for lunch downtown. When I want vegan food, I don't crave meat substitutes- I just want vegetables that taste really good. This place does that very well. The owner is from Senegal, and that shows in the Afro-Caribbean notes to the dishes. The flavors and spices are bright and interesting, and the veggies are perfectly cooked. I'm only dinging a star for speed, so make sure you're not in a hurry if you visit. The wait will be worth it, though."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a better review, but the wait times are HORRIBLE. I even knew this from my fiance's prior experience and called an hour ahead, but still waited 45 minutes after getting there! It made me late to get back to work.  Judging by the eye rolls of others waiting at the counter, I'm not the only one a little dumb founded by this... get it together cause youre only open at lunch!

The only reason I'll give this place a second try is because of how delicious the falafel salad was. But next time I'm calling ahead and telling them I'm coming right then, but won't show up for another hour."}
{"text":"Yep.  Best vegan food I've ever eaten.  Fresh ingredients, not bland, obviously prepared by experienced chefs.  The cheesesteak gyro was huge and the \"meat\" was really tasty.  And nice people too."}
{"text":"Bit hard to find if you're not looking for it, this place is a small organic and vegan kitchen that's part of the Euclid Arcade. The lady at the counter who owns the eatery was very hospitable and motherly, and opened the kitchen back up for us even though we reached just after they had closed. 

I ordered the Tofu Philly Cheese which came with good sized pieces of tofu (cooked to perfection with the right amount of chewy), grilled veggies, tomatoes, and their vegan tartar sauce. The wrap was kinda messy, and though I wasn't blown away, the food was simple and wholesome. I definitely want to revisit to try the other things on the menu. 

Food was fairly priced, and I think it's a good place to pick up a quick healthy lunch, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food quality, although it really takes TIME to prepare these individual meals. You will receive generous portions of delicious and healthy food. Be prepared to wait and it's not the best place to go if you're in a hurry. This is not vegan fast food joint. It seems they are improving all the time though so I can only imagine that the organizational issues they have will be worked out in time."}
{"text":"I agree with everyone's comments. This little place is amazing - the food is wonderful and so is the staff (seriously, this is probably THE friendliest staff I've ever come across). I am so happy to have found this place. The ground nut stew is amazing and is a great portion for the price. It comes with a side of kale that is wonderfully cooked and spiced. The cheeze steak gyro is also incredible. If you're not sure what you want to try, the staff is more than happy to give you a suggestion."}
{"text":"After yelping for places we've never eaten at downtown, we settled upon Pure and Supreme, based on the wealth of good reviews.

And we were not disappointed! Located in the Euclid arcade, this little restaurants has delicious home cooked food. And it's vegan too!

We ordered the special of the day- for ten bucks, we got a plantain tomato stew, curry cauliflower, Mac n cheese, and collard greens. All of it was delicious- I especially liked the sweetness and tangy-ness of the plantain tomato stew. It even came with this homemade corn muffin which was moist, not too oily, and just good.

We also got a side of hummus (with warm whole grain pita) and a salad with some homemade dressing too.

All in all, if you're around the Euclid arcade, this place is definitely worth trying out. They take a little while to prepare the food, but it has that homemade taste to it, which makes it all worth it."}
{"text":"Five stars for food, negative ten stars for the comically long waits to pick up your order. Every single time! The menu disclaimer says something along the lines of \"Please be patient, we are lovingly making your food from scratch.\" As lovely a sentiment as that is, I just think 40 minutes to get a take-out order is too much, especially when it's a raw salad...

I always say \"Never again\", but who am I kidding? I freaking love this place. 

I have loved everything I've tried. Unlike The Flaming Ice Cube (probably my fave vegan place), most of the dishes here are presented in as close to its whole, raw food state as possible versus vegan versions of something else. Try the guacamole with pita. It's the best $6 lunch ever. They make the guacamole from scratch (see above, LOL), and it is served over mixed greens and tons of chopped veggies.

From now on, I'm going to try calling ahead first and see if that works."}
{"text":"Very helpful staff, Server explained every dish that was asked about in detail. The Food was surprisingly delicious, the favor combinations were amazing. Sure to be a New favorite of mine. :-)"}
{"text":"Located in the connector between the 5th St and Colonial Arcades (the ones between Euclid and Prospect), this food stand provides very fresh lunchtime options. 

I ordered the Vegan Cheese Steak Gyro which comes with Vegan Roast, onions, peppers, baby bella mushrooms, tomatoes, lettuce, thin avocado slices and house prepared cheese sauce. I'm not sure what \"Vegan Roast\" is, but it was good. There was a bit of a spice throughout the entire dish and the veg definitely tasted fresh. 

The Vegan Cheese Steak Gyro can come in a wrap, or not. I got it in a wrap, but the wrap was wrapped so loosely that I ended up eating it with a fork anyways for the most part. 

I definitely enjoyed the food and will keep this place in mind for a cheap, healthy lunch ($7)."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while looking for a healthy lunch. Ended up trying the curry plantain stew which came with kale greens and a muffin. The food was fresh and delicious, and the owner was friendly and sweet as could be. It warmed me up on a very cold Cleveland day. Can't wait to try the other specials here."}
{"text":"I've noticed this place multiple times when I've had a day off and have gone to Kabob House across the way for a falafel. But, today, I finally decided to give Pure and Supreme a shot, and I am SO glad I did.

For the most part, I am a vegetarian, and like Jessica I. said- it's nice to have a flavorful and nutritious meal without the overuse of meat substitutes! 

I talked to the sweet lady at the counter, Amira (I'm sure I butchered the spelling), for a bit when I first got there about the different items on the menu. I went around 1:30pm and there wasn't a rush and it wasn't chaotic or disorganized like one of the reviews mentioned. So, I must've picked a good time. After hearing about a few dishes, I settled on the Vegan Cheese Steak Gyro - Amira said that a lot of the regulars tend to order this every time (tho she's not sure if they just enjoyed it the first time and haven't tried anything else or if it truly is the most popular item). I was told it would be about 7-8 minutes since they make it from scratch, which I was MORE than okay with! A few minutes later, she asked if I wanted to sample their red beans and rice while I waited - of course I said yes, expecting a small sample. She prepared a full bowl of their red beans and rice, complete with cauliflower and some greens on top. It was SO delicious and hearty! As they packed my meal, they gave me a corn muffin as well (delicious, soft, wonderful).

The gyro was phenomenal. Similar to Mary F., I have NO idea what the protein part of the Gyro was made of, but what I do know is that it was DAMN delicious!! Super flavorful with lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, and grilled peppers and onions on top. The vegan cheese was also amazing! I always have said I could never be vegan b/c I love cheese (and ice cream) way too much, but I didn't feel like I was missing anything in this meal!

For all of this food, I paid 7 dollars. Super cheap for a super filling and delicious meal (I have some leftovers for later, still).

I'll definitely be back to try some more things on the menu when I have days off!! I was also told that in about 2 weeks they are changing some of the menu and adding breakfast - they are going to start opening at 8am."}
