{"text":"Deserves less than one star! Super slow service and mediocre food. Ordered three dished and it took about an hour to servered even after we were finished the house soup. Save your time & money and eat elsewhere"}
{"text":"Love coming here for dim sum! Service might not the greatest, but good quality food and decent price."}
{"text":"Where do I start??
I've been frequenting this place for the last 5 - 6 years for dim sum only and have always left satisfied.

Call ahead to book and go with a large group. They wont take reservations for less than 5 ppl.

If you've their 'membership', tea is free and 10% off on every visit. It's definitely worth it. 

In winter, wear warm yet not too bulky jacket because you might end up sitting near the entrance and you've to put on your jacket while you eat.

But...today's (Jan 17, 2016) visit has left me questioning whether the chef has changed or the ingredients have changed ...Because the beef tender wasn't as 'red' or saucy, beef ball (with chestnut) wasn't as dark colored and texture was different, sweet yellow bun (with the egg york filling) was kinda dry.. Like it was frozen too long and not steamed long enough.. 
OK enough of my complain.. I'll go back again and give it another chance.. Maybe after 6 months :)"}
{"text":"Came to this place for dinner, the service was really bad, food was nasty had a really bad stomach ache after. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here before with my family and the food is pretty good. What isn't good is the service though. In my experience, waitresses and waiters will do everything to ignore you. Also, wait times are really long when you come in during peak times, but that's expected. Prices are also affordable at $2.58 per dish on weekdays and $2.78 on weekends and holidays. They also have a column for dishes that are $2.99 and sort of like a chef's special that's $4.99."}
{"text":"BEWARE of this ?? restaurant. I was beyond shocked how horrible the service, food, and also in an attempt to scam customers on the bill. The waiter had called us \"dumbass\" when we refused to order their promotional lobster meal. We waited over 1 hour and 40 mimins for our food. We told the staff if they can check on our order.  They ALL brush us off with  attitudes. When the food arrived, it was cold and the fish was incredibly stinky. Just as I though the dinner  cannot get any worst, they are able to escalate the situation to \"RESTAURANT IN HELL\"!!! The rude and unprofessional waiter throw the bill on our table while we didn't even call for the bill. I checked the bill and realized they oovercharge us by $59 CAD. When we raised the issue to them, they still provide a revised incorrect bill with an overcharge Of $23. It is definitely not a careless mistake. The overcharge was input under a stamp in attempt to conceal the overcharge by having the number blur out. STAY FAR FAR FAR away from this restaurant.  You will be way better off eating at a food court or instant noodle at home."}
{"text":"I went here for dim sum just the other day. As a Vancouver native, I've learned to lower my standards when it comes to food here over the years. With that being said, this place is pretty standard. Dishes are relatively cheap and decently sized for the price (except for the Feng zhao aka. chicken feet). 

The most important part for me is the MSG levels. I did NOT get that thirsty feeling that is so very characteristic of high MSG levels. 

Service was slower than I would have hoped. Some dishes took almost an hour to come. Not so good if you're looking for a quick dim sum fix."}
{"text":"AVOID this restaurant unless you don't mind eating with COCKROACHES. We just had dinner at this restaurant and the food isn't spectacular or all that good to begin with. However the worse part was when we were leaving there was a cockroach crawling on the wall behind where we were sitting. So grossed out and will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Went for dim sum today for Father's Day weekend. Dead cockroaches fell out of some of the dim sum bamboo containers onto the table when the lady put it down. The manager immediately took it away and decided to make up for it by giving us free dessert. Found cockroaches inside the dessert. We left immediately."}
{"text":"Agree with some of the other reviews, in that if I could give less than one star, I would have. I literally just got back from having dimsum here. Unbelievably crowded to the point where you can't really walk between tables comfortably. I've always had a problem with the types of people that frequent this place for dimsum (imagine Chinese people that are literally fresh off the boat from China...it seriously sounded like a shouting match at the table next to ours). Biggest problem was that after handing in our order, it took one hour before our first dish of dimsum arrived. We followed up with the waiter, and he claimed that there were just a lot of people, and that they hadn't left out/lost our order somewhere. I'm not sure what's more concerning...the fact that they potentially lost our order and blatantly lied to us when we asked, or the fact that it takes an hour to get the first dish out. Totally unacceptable when all they have to do is put together the necessary ingredients and steam them. I have NEVER had to wait this long for food at a restaurant EVER (not even going with a large party of 12 people to a non-Chinese establishment where all the mains etc. have to come out at the same time). Service was totally unacceptable. Add to this, the fact that they preferentially let regulars get tables first (fine, I don't have a huge issue with this), but let their regulars just walk deep into the restaurant and just awkwardly stand next to tables of people eating (I do NOT need you to stand right next to me when I'm eating my rice noodle rolls, thanks), I will never go back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Dim sum is cheap but only certain items are good. I usually order the shrimp dumpling, siu mai, shrimp rice noodle roll, chicken feet, char siu pastry, their desserts.

Their congee is horrible

For dinner my 4 star rating goes to their lobster. We always order the salty egg lobster, a veggie dish such as watercress, fu Yu tong choy, or GAi lan. Their mushroom with beef tenderloin chunks is tasty and their hand shredded chicken or half a free range chicken is good too. Fair prices."}
{"text":"I like to come to this place with my man for dim sum. Good food, nice service, quite cheap. With a VIP card we even get a discount of 10 percent!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!! Went there on CNY eve for a family dinner.  Beyond disorganized, have never been to a restaurant with a bunch of idiotic service staff.

Made a reservation for 7:45pm and arrived and was seated fairly promptly.  Ordered a set meal and was informed 10 minutes after they do not have a certain dish. We were asked to have it substituted at an additional cost.  Which is BS!! How is it my problem you don't have the dish avaliable.  After the order was modified we recieved a order receipt on our table and the time was8:09pm ..............................................................................................9:00pm rolls around and we still don't have any food!?!  After numerous attempts to ask where our food is nothing came.

Needless to say we left and went somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"Ever since I introduced my mom to eat here, this has been our go to dimsum restaurant every Sunday :) one of my favourite restaurant that never fails to disappoint me. I especially love their ride noodle roll, so fresh and soft!"}
{"text":"A favourite for dimsum. It's a good neighborhood Chinese restaurant for a dim sum. Its a favourite for my coworkers and I, and we are a diverse cultural group!  Limited parking by the door for those with accessibility concerns. For dim sum, this place provide some of the biggest bang for your bucks.  My coworker lives in the West end, and after introducing him to this restaurant, he now makes routine trip with his friends from west side Toronto to this place on the weekend!


Came for dinner this time, meals are good value. There are MSG involved in the food here during dinner service."}
{"text":"Food 2.5/5 (50% of final grade)
There was nothing particularly special with the dimsum, to be honest. Some foods erred on the bland side (like the congee), and some foods were slightly above par (like the har gao; translucent steamed shrimp dumplings). All in all, the quality offset each other. 

Ambiance 2.5/5 (15% of final grade)
We went for morning dimsum brunch, and it happened to be a nice day, so the interior was lit well. However, there wasn't anything particularly noteworthy in this establishment. It was simply a typical dimsum place. Not too clean, not too dirty, not too broken, not too refined. Basically, a normal dimsum place.

Service 2/5 (15% of final grade)
Although there were some people waiting to be seated, it wasn't THAT busy, so I didn't understand why most of the service was so rushed, even for a dimsum establishment (usually quite fast paced). I went with 4 other friends, so we were to split the bill at the end of the meal, but when we went to pay they told us that we should have informed them beforehand that we were splitting, and we can't split now, so we'll have to \"figure it out ourselves\". No sympathy for our circumstances, not the slightest apologetic tone at all. I firmly believe that when it is unclear who is to pay for the bill, that the person who seats us at least informs us of the bill-splitting procedures.

Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade)
At-par with other dimsum restaurants of its calibre (the at-par calibre).

Other 0/5 (10% of final grade)
This category is the brownie points round. No brownie points were garnered. 

Final Grade = 43.5/100 = 2 Stars

TLDR: It's not an I-won't-be-back-ever-hasta-la-vista place, but it's difficult to see why I would be back on my own accord. If you ever do venture here though, try their har gao (translucent shrimp dumplings), those were the highlight of my venture in contrast to everything else.

{"text":"I've been to a lot of Chinese restaurants, but I've never tasted such bland chinese food before... ever!

Mind you, it was dinner for Chinese New Year so the restaurant was packed and I mean PACKED!  People were waiting upwards to 90 minutes to get a table!  So maybe because they were so busy, they had to bring out the food fast (and they were decent) and sacrifice quality.

Back to the bland food, the soup was watery, the deep fried shrimps were tasteless, the fried rice and noodles at the end were completely saltless.  

Maybe they ran out of salt?!"}
{"text":"We are visiting the area, craving Chinese food and spotted this place from the highway. Despite the mediocre rating (3 stars) we decided to give it a try. The place wasn't busy (we went on a weeknight around 8pm) but as the evening progresses more and more patrons arrived. 

This place deserves a much better rating! Service is prompt, friendly and attentive. Food is very delicious. We ordered Peking duck, crispy chicken, gai lan beef and choy sum. We enjoyed every dish. Will definitely return when we visit the area next time!"}
{"text":"- average and service-able dim sum joint
- incredibly cheap (which means it's rammed by 1115am on the weekends)
- so cheap that 13 dishes plus tea charge plus tax was on $34. stellar yo."}
{"text":"The food is good here I like it.  Not the best selection but the staff were nice to us. We always come alot though."}
{"text":"Cheap eats and fast service for dim sum. A bit of a wait but the place is spacious so I expect turnaround time to be short.

For parking, may be best to go a little bit further away than the entrance as space is limited

Be aware that some of the food that they serve as they walk around may not be the freshest. Often, best to wait for another fresh round of pastries or dishes to come out.

We had a VIP card so it was $45 before tip for 6 people!"}
{"text":"The food is decent for dim sum but nothing spectacular nor is it inventive - one star. The décor is blasé at best after renovation - no stars. The one thing I am really peeved about is their shady business tactics. We bought a member card from them a year ago; at the time the manager said it can be used for life and assured us there would be no further charges as long as the restaurant is still around. THIS IS FALSE! We were told they upgraded their computer system and now that card can't be used and need to pay for a new one. They raise the card price every year so how is this a lifetime card? Why not just call it an annual card instead of misinforming people? I feel they take advantage of the many elderly people here. I'd give negative stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Personally feel this is a good tasteful dim sum restaurant. For casual and everyday going ! 

My family and I come here 5 days a week mostly for breakfast tea/lunch. Their food is fresher and more tasty than most dim sum opened in Markham right now. They have alot of the classics like PorkBlood and Chives, Squid tentacles, Sui Mai, Cheung Fun, Harr  Gow, Lai Yao Bao, etc. The 11am food selection gets bigger with more interesting dishes to eat. 

The service is fast paced and casual, dont expect them to be around all the time but for the price point they are very efficient and have a nice serving staff. ! 

I recommend people to have this as the go to casual Dim Sum dining spot !! 

After 11 it can get busy so try reserving a spot before you arrive."}
{"text":"Came here for a dim sum lunch today and did not have a very good experience.  On one of the hottest days in Toronto, the air conditioner was either broken or not turned on.  I normally add chili oil to most of my food, but because it was so not, I didn't even bother asking for chili oil.

As for the food, it was decent.  The har gow (shrimp dumpling) had great flavours but the skin was a bit on thick.  The sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf was great, but be aware that there are peanuts in it.  We ordered the pineapple BBQ pork bun and it was weird.  For those of you that are familiar with Chinese pineapple buns, it's just a bun with a flaky top that resembles a pineapple.  This pineapple BBQ pork bun had an actual piece of pineapple in the BBQ pork mixture and I didn't feel that it was a good combination.

Overall, the food at Da Fu has decent flavours, but don't expect any nice presentation.  Unfortunately, my experience was not great due to the heat."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our dinner here. I came here with my family on the Winter Solstice. IT was a bit of a trek, but this was the only place that had any seats for this apparently super popular festival. We ordered a 10-course lobster meal (the standard for my family) and the dishes started coming out. FAST. At one point, we had to tell them to put a pause on everything, we couldn't eat it fast enough. I thought everything was very good, particularly the lobster. My brother loved the crispy skin chicken. The fried rice and noodles were also good, as was the fish. Best of all, instead of the dreaded red bean soup for dessert, we had the taro dessert soup. The meal even came with pop.

The damage came to roughly $33 per person (there were 10 of us) with tax and tip. Considering we took boxes of food home and were absolutely stuffed, I'd say that's one hell of a deal.

There wasn't a dish I didn't like here, I'd be glad to return, despite how far it is."}
{"text":"The dimsum is spectacular! Some items are very unique and tasty. It is very affordable. The portion size is generic and traditional. They do not push carts full of food rather they place the paper menu on the table and you can check- mark as many plates of food as you wish. Best of all there is English translation below the Chinese characters. The noise level and ambiance is the same as any other Chinese dim sum restaurants in the GTA. You get what you paid for and sometimes even more. It is very clean and the food is prepared very well. 

I go there almost every couple of weeks with my family and no complaints. Although parking can sometimes be a problem but the food and service makes up for it. I have been there since it opened and the chef, quality of the food, and taste factor is still the same if not slightly better."}
{"text":"Review on the run...

Wow talk about blah.  Crappy service, crappy food.. But it was cheap.  Me and my extended family went out here on a weekend, and everything was just bland, greasy and meh.  It took forever for them to take our order, then forever again for the food to get there.

Forever and ever, and never to part, forever and ever we two.. (Consider yourself Rick Roll'd)

Conclusion: Eat Here ? Heck no."}
{"text":"I come here for cheap dim sum. cheap. I didn't not say it was top notch hand crafted pieces of art so don't expect to come here and get a meal made by a
Michelin-Star chef LOL. They have all-Day dim sum specials for a flat price (unless marked otherwise) which they serve until 2-3ish..? (Never pushed it later than that) 

I mean for what I usually pay it's pretty good. I come here almost once a month sometimes twice and dont see any reason why I should stop coming unless they jack up the prices and stop serving the generic frozen dim sum that every typical Chinese restaurant gets from the same supplier that I have grown accustomed to.

Place is dated and looks pretty half-ass wanna be banquet \"Chinese-wedding\" style looking. 

Service isnt too bad here actually but I only come when there's like 2-3 tables TOTAL."}
{"text":"Service slow and not always friendly. The food is good during down times. When the place gets busy like Chinese new year, the food quality plummets. I find a lot of Chinese cuisines do this during holidays or special occasions. They probably prepare the food in batch.. So sad. Won't be coming back, unless parents go."}
{"text":"'We come here for dinner, once in a while. Tonight we got sashimi propellor clams. We got some steamed ones too. Food is quite good here and portions are big. Would recommend you come for dinner. They serve dim sum in the mornings but I've never tried lunch. Service is ok, for a chinese place."}
{"text":"Affordable dim sum? Look no further. However only some of the regular staple of Chinese dim sum are up to my \"tasty\" standard. Tasty: ha gao (steam shrimp dumpling), siew  mai, fung jow (chicken feet), ngao yuk (beef ball) and cheung fun (rice roll). The rest are ok; better at other dim sum places. 

If you don't want to wait for a table on the the weekend, come before 10am. After that it starts filling up!

The free homemade soy milk, is a nice touch. Always get myself a cup."}
{"text":"I've yet to try its dim sum, but the few times I've been there for dinner I thought the food was fresh and flavorful. The place has recently added a VIP points-reward system where you purchase a lifetime (Does any Chinese restaurant in Scarborough/Markham lasts more than five years?) membership card (for $18) to receive a 10% discount on regular menu items and other perks. On our most recent visit, we took the opportunity to try the six-pound lobster in maggi sauce for $5.99/lb and it was quite delicious. We also had a braised spare ribs in hot pot, a sesame & garlic beef tenderloin, and a mixed buddha vegetarian platter - none of which was spectacular, but still tasty. One of the floor servers was very attentive in bringing us new plates and removing our dirty ones throughout the meal. I did also notice the runner-woman who brought the food to our table was acting only friendly towards regular patrons she recognized, and was less than cheerful with us, so there appears to be favoritism and inconsistency with the overall service. 

However, based on food quality and value alone, I would definitely recommend giving this place a try (if you're ever up in that neck of the woods)."}
{"text":"It's alright. Probably your best bet for dim sum in the area. But portion sizes are small, taste is good, value is not great...

What We Got: beef tripe, rice bowl with preserved meat, and an assortment of other traditional dim sum dishes
What I'd Get Again: ...??? 
What I'd Try Next: ...???

The beef tripe was actually good, but it's now a specialty item ($$$), which is crazy to me since it's such a staple.

The rice bowls were woefully small.

I mainly eat those two things (AS A CHILD, I WOULD ORDER JUST THREE RICE BOWLS AT DIM SUM... so I'm uniquely qualified to judge a dim sum rice bowl.)

The veggies were alright. The fried goods were decent.

(Yeah, I am admittedly not a big fan of dim sum to begin with.)

Temperature of the building was quite hot.
Parking is a bit challenging - it's in the area of the plaza that has fewer spots.

And yet, there's something to be said that it's still here.
As smaller shops around it in the same plaza come and go, Dafu stands the test of time, remaining packed even on weekday afternoons. The combination of convenience in the area and the tradition of dim sum makes this a hot spot for families (seems like all the seniors in the surrounding condos come here) - though not necessarily for the best reasons."}
{"text":"I have only been here once for dinner, so this review is based on a one-time experience. Maybe I had very low expectation going in (as I had read some bad reviews), so I thought the dinner was... fine, or even exceeded my (low) expectation.
 
The Lobster combo dinner that we got at $218 (see picture w/ translation):
 
1) the chicken was clearly the winner, you know how sometimes the chicken can taste so chicken-less but not here,
2) they did not \"steal\" too much lobster meat (you know what I'm talking about!) which was very much appreciated and the meat texture was firm,
3) the fish tofu soup was surprisingly tasty and don't think they put in MSG (or not that much cos none of us was thirsty after),
4) the fried rice was great even as a leftover lunch the next day, BUT,
5) the oysters had too much batter and a bit tasteless
 
All other dishes were done fairly well with decent portion.  The service was surprisingly good as well. 
 
To sum up, the portion from the $218 combo (actually had to add one or two more dishes so +$25) is good for 10 adult eaters. If you don't expect too much, this place could be a good choice for semi-casual family dinners in Markham."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Seafood dishes here hits all the right notes from delicate steamed eel, sashimi geoduck to fried lobster in pork fat and garlicky goodness. I've only ever been here for seafood dinner and the food has always been good. I must say I have noticed that some customers who come here sometimes look a little bit more casual / or even a bit rougher around the edges, but it helps if you want to eat a bit more casually and slurp on claws if you want to :) 

 food is good
 prices are reasonable
 their specials and deals are great had peking duck once for $18.99. 

Love their seafood the timing is insanely accurate. It is almost always precisely cooked to just the right doneness."}
{"text":"The dim sum here used to be REALLY good, our go to spot - 4 star worthy, but it's sadly not the case anymore. Most of the dishes aren't simply the same and that happened sometime within the last 6 months. They're smaller, more pale, less juicy, and less tasty. What has happened?! I'm so disappointed. I just can't see any reason to come here for dim sum anymore.

We got pretty much everything and the only thing I considered average was the chicken feet. The meats were terrible. They're pale and tough. They used to be so incredibly juicy before. The beef balls are so small and nearly white in colour and so was the sui mai. The shrimp and rice items are still pretty decent here, so that's still a good thing to order. BBQ pork buns are also okay. Pretty much everything was rather small in size, but the price reflects it so I guess that's okay. 

It used to be PACKED here and you would have to wait a long time to get a seat but we walked right in with a party of 10 to a table (but that was 10am). I don't know if other people has caught on too.

Service has always been questionable here, it's Chinese service in the purest sense but they are very timely bringing out the items, refilling teas and taking away plates. Another positive is the price, it's still one of the cheaper dim sum joints. It's still a decent place, dinner isn't bad based on past experience (but I can't say if that has changed either), but considering how good it was before, it is truly a shame."}
{"text":"Came here this morning and they changed the dim sum sheet. Some items are eliminated and some items got a little bit more expensive. There are less items now."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner for my bro's birthday and generally, it was a meh experience. Nothing in particular about this restaurant stood out to me honestly.

To be honest, I thought this place looked quite attractive on the outside. When I went in, it was another story. It's like they are trying to be fancy...but it doesn't necessarily come off that way?!? 

The staff and service was ehhh. One of the ladies working there kept talking to us which personally I find annoying. I felt like she constantly tried to have a conversation with us... like gorl pls stop. I kinda don't want you spitting over our food ... lol. I don't know what happened but somehow a family that came way later than us got their food before we did (they ordered the same thing as us) like ... um ?!? wut!? why!! WHAT DID WE DO?!?

Food wise. Nothing stood out really. Some tasted alright while others were a bit questionable. The only notable thing was the complimentary peanuts they gave out. They're nothing special but I kept scarfing them down. Low key they were the star of the show LOOL YOU GO PEANUTS !! 

**note: they give out complimentary soup and desserts (some kind of papaya, white fungus soup dessert and mango pudding)"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my go-to dim sum places, until they recently renovated. The place looks more dull than it used to, and the staff seems to have changed. The prices have also gone up by $0.20. The quality in the food seemed to be lacking, and not as consistent as it used to be. The Chiu Chow Dumplings used to be my favourite here, as they don't skimp on the ingredients, however this time it just wasn't the same no more. Service was definitely not the best either, as the servers were quite rude. Sigh....this place is close to me as well :( I guess I will drive the extra mile to Landmark Chinese Cuisine, because I find their dishes taste much better."}
{"text":"Come here a lot for dim sum and dinner. It's not the best thing in the world but it's comforting and homey tasting and I think it's still delicious! My family has the card and it's free tea and 10% off I think. If you come here more than a few times a year it's worth it! Servers are OK, in my opinion it's really the manager who saves the day. She's incredibly friendly to my parents. Also to note that the prices are quite good--my family of 5's bill came to $45 with tax and tip. Will come here time and time again!"}
{"text":"Food is great here. We had our Chinese new years dinner here and they definitely do sea food well! I wish the Peking duck came earlier though. We got ours at the very very end of our meal and had to get two orders because the one duck wasn't big enough. 

Service is average. They were friendly but really pushy and messy. Our server kept talking over us and then taking to other people while we were taking to her. General rude behaviors, but hey, we got the right orders. 

Not much else to comment on. Bathrooms could be cleaner but they weren't awful. Average place, OK service, good food. :)"}
{"text":"Came here for Dim Sum this morning. There was a line and finally got seated after 20 minutes wait. The food was ok - typical of any Dim Sum restaurant in Toronto. The waitress were practically running because it was so busy. The decor were showing signs of age and the ambience loud. This also is most typical of any Dim Sum restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Went there for dim sum.  Overall the dim sum was good except the wait was horrendous. Especially when the waiters give priority to their friends!  The last time we went we waited over 90 minutes and saw over 10 tables that left and friends of the waiters got the tables without waiting. because of this we chose not to go here anymore."}
{"text":"I've been her before for dinner, and I remembered it was good.

However, recently, I went there for dim sum with my parents, aunt, and cousin.  We ordered the following: har gow, siu mai, eggplant, congee, chicken feet, turnip cake, bbq pork rice noodle, shrimp rice noodle, beef balls, chiu chow dumplings just to name a few.

I was quite impressed by the har gow, siu mai, and shrimp rice noodle.  The shrimp was large and tasty.  The chicken feet was delicious as well, however, it might have been that I was craving for chicken feet.  The \"chiu chow dumplings\" were good as wel.

I never had a chance to try the bbq pork rice noodle, beef balls or eggplant.

I was very disappointed with the congee.  It was suppose to be a vegetable and fish slice congee.  It just tasted like plain congee with a few chopped vegetables in it.  No fish taste at all!  The steamed turnip cake was bland as well.  Had no taste at all.

Some things were really good, but I've had better dim sum at other places."}
{"text":"Came here at 10:30am on Labour Day and I waited 45minutes for a table of three.  I asked a combination of different and same servers five times for three plates of hot sauces.  They acknowledged it by stating okay and/or nodding.  They finally gave us one hot sauce after the frequent asking.  I had to continue to ask another server again for two additional hot sauces since I didn't get enough.  Of course, I didn't get it.  Since my food was served and I didn't want it to get cold, I went to the cashier and waited for the hot sauces (that's where they prepare the hot sauces).  I understand that they were busy but their customer service could have been way better.  Their food is standard compared to other dim sum places.  You order on a sheet and they bring the food to you  (usually fresher than the traditional cart).  Everything was hot except for the congee."}
{"text":"Under new management! I have to say that this place has gotten a lot worse within the past few months. I'm saying this service and food wise. Normally I wouldn't expect much from an Asian restaurant, but  the service has gone down by a ton since the new owner took over. Servers were unfriendly and were in denial of our complaints about the food. We ordered a stir fried morning glory plate that was partially raw, underseasoned and nearly impossible to chew. About half of the vegetables was the \"old\" part of the stem that you would normally throw out. However, they decided to throw it on our plate and charge us. We also ordered the seafood in bird's nest. This dish was $18.99, but absolutely not worth the price. There were only 4 shrimps and the rest were mediocre vegetables and chewy squid. Lastly, the taro soup dessert was completely bland! They probably forgot to add sugar, and that is unacceptable! I won't be back again any time soon."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner on a Sunday. We got there at around 5:30pm. There was only one other table that was earlier than us. An hour later the place was pretty full. Since we were one of the only ones there the service was quite fast. Within 5 minutes of placing our orders, food began arriving.

The meal starts off with complementary soup. I thought the soup had great flavour and a hint of sweetness. 

Sweet and sour pork with pineapples - cooked well with nice outer crunchy batter but there were some pieces of pork that had way too much batter. Wish there were more pineapples.

Beef and onion dish - not sure why the beef was chopped into such small cubes. I would have rather them be in larger chunks. The sauce was a sweet BBQ type flavour. Beef was somewhat tender but hard to tell since the pieces are cut so small. 

Snow pea leaf tips - cooked very well and good portion. The leaves were fresh and harvested young so they tasted very good.

Mixed seafood dish which had shrimp, scallop, squid and mixed veggies. I thought the amount of seafood was generous. The seafood also tasted very fresh - squid was soft and easy to chew, shrimps had good bite to them and the scallops were large and tasty.

Meal ended with complementary dessert: sweet glutinous rice soup and also jello cubes.

Overall, a very good Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"The food to me wasn't that great & a little more on the expensive side for dim sum considering it's quality. The service is not great during busy times, as the restaurant is pretty big. Found myself neglected by waiters many many times, even for things as simple as asking for water. 

Now the biggest issue I had with this place was when the meal was finished. We had asked for 3 cups of water which they had charged us $1.00 each for without notifying us.. they added a service charge to our meal and we gave a very little tip simply because we didn't enjoy our service, food or the way they were treating us. 

After paying the lady had noticed our tip wasn't 10% and gave us all dirty looks and said we live in Canada... demanding that we give tip and are rude for not doing so. If you are not Chinese, I don't recommend this place found it very very disrespectful."}
{"text":"We've been here for dim sum and dinners for many times. This is well known for affordable food. For the price you are paying, the food taste much better than anywhere else that has similar price range. So If you don't want to spend too much yet want to have some tasty food, then you should definitely try out this place."}
{"text":"We waited over 30 minutes for our fried radish cake. We also just realized they used plastic plates for hot food which isn't the most appealing. The table arrangement is very poor. Customers and staff have difficulty getting around the tables. Lastly, the service was only good around Chinese New Year (in the hopes that they'll get red pockets). Can't say I like this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went today for dim sum. Even though the place seems to be busy, they must be coming there for the price point; because the food quality was mediocre. I would rather pay more for better quality and tastier food! There are a lot more good dim sum places in Scarbrough/Markham area for me to return here again."}
{"text":"This review is for dim sum only.  We came late around 1:30pm on a Sunday afternoon.  Wait wasn't too long as I believe dim sum ended around 3:30pm.
Was very surprised at the value of dishes as all the standard dishes (ie. S/M/L) were all the same price of $2.68.  Dishes that were more was indicated on the order form.

Food came out quick and hot so that was a plus.  All the items were very good quality including the har gow, siu mai, etc..  A great surprise was the fried taro root cake which was made with small slices of taro and carrots! 

Staff for the most part was good and friendly....only negative was the greeter who seemed to have an attitude when we asked for a bigger table to fit our large group.
Washrooms weren't the cleanest either so that was a negative as well.

Other then that can't complain as we all enjoyed the food.  Will definitely come back again for dim sum!"}
{"text":"I definitely think this place deserves more then the 2.5 stars it says on Google.

I've been to a few Chinese Style Giant Lobster restaurants and a few of my friends recommended i try this one cause the food is good and the price is cheap.

Made a dinner RSVP for 8.  Didn't order the set courses.. instead we ordered 2 x 6lbs lobsters, 8lbs of king crab, and a geoduck.

The lobsters were $115 each, which is really cheap, both were cooked differently. The garlic stir-fry tasted ok. But still a great price for live seafood.  The other lobster was cooked with the duck egg yolk and that was pretty good - definitely recommend!!

The $350 King crab was cooked 4 ways, two of which were steamed crab legs.. the meat was super tender, the noodles underneath were delicious. The stir-fry cage was super tasty! These probably being the highlight of the night. The fried rice with the crab was just a plate of fried rice. Nothing special at all.

The $125 Geoduck was probably 2lbs.. we had it sashimi style and stir fried in a batter..  both dishes were pretty disappointing.. wouldn't recommend.

Beers were $2.80 each!!!!!!

Overall, I would recommend this place for lobster stir fried in egg yolk batter. And I would recommend the artic king crab.

Decorations were pretty bland.. just go here for live seafood."}
{"text":"My in-laws love coming here ( because of the great price for dim sum), but I find things are getting worst. The wait can be long and it is very crowded where you wait. When the host calls the number she is not very loud and only in Cantonese (I had to ask someone how the number was pronounced). The quality of the food does not seem as good as before. I also sometimes felt rushed by the staff to finish because they needed a table for all those people waiting. The only reason I will go back is because it's my in-laws favorite place. I will have to introduce them to other good and cheap dim sum places."}
{"text":"Aesthetically this place isn't the best, however it is good bang for your buck. Prices are very reasonably priced and the food is never overly salty or greasy. The salt and spicy pork chop is very good and, surprisingly, so is the seafood egg white dish which is lined with brocoli. 

One of the servers was extremely rude both times i've been there, however most of the others are okay."}
{"text":"It had been quite a while ( maybe 2 years) since I last ate here and it was apparent the place had undergone a fairly extensive reno so it looked clean and brightly lit. 
  The dim sum, while not the best I have ever tasted was certainly right up their with my favourites. The beef cheung fun ( rice roll) was perfectly cooked ( it is often served a little too pink for my liking). Ditto the shrimp roll. The turnip cake was good, not great and the pineapple buns, which I don't normally order were a pleasant change.
  Overall, a very positive experience- far different from the very negative reviews on TripAdvisor ( several of which I would presume were fake) and I would certainly recommend to anyone seeking a good dim sum experience."}
{"text":"Came for dinner and it was pretty good overall~ Got free soup and two kinds of desserts and the waiters were friendly!

I wouldn't mind coming back~ but I didn't looooove anything in particular so I guess I would have to give it a 3 for pretty good but not blowing my mind amazing. Maybe I didn't order the right stuff :p"}
{"text":"Low quality; a lot of filler in the food.  Pan-fried taro cake was mostly rice flour, with no taro or even taro flavor.  Left a funny, oily aftertaste.  Fish congee had small fish bones and fish scales mixed in with the big bones and fins; hard to eat, even for someone who likes bone-in fish."}
{"text":"It is an average restaurant.  Nothing is outstanding here, but food is very reasonably priced and most of it tasty.  I come here with my Grandma on occasion as it is close to where she lives and so travel is minimal.

Parking is kind of weird here as the restaurant is located at a narrow strip of parking spots that are almost always full, so usually you'll have to park further out.  

Last time I came it was very noisy as they were renovating and I believe are expanding.  Maybe that will mean a better menu as well!"}
{"text":"I'm quite surprised to see so many negative reviews for this place, as this is our go to place for dim sum every Saturday for the past 4 years. 

Every Saturday we order the same dishes. 
- Steamed beef ribs
- chicken feet 
- har gow
- either the beef rice roll or olive and ribs rice
- deep fried shrimp with mayo

The food is always flavourful and delicious. Not too salty like some places, but also not tasteless. Occasionally they have lunch specials for their lobster noodle. Omg so delicious and full of flavour!! -drools-

When it comes to chinese dim sum, this place meets all three expectations : cheap, delicious, and good quality. 

For dinner - I've only been here once and we only had the Alaskan King Crab (3 styles), which ended up costing $300 for the both of us..it was amazing, but costly :'("}
{"text":"had dimsum at this place recently.
it's pretty standard. the one dish that stood out i don't even remember what it was called, my friend ordered it since he had been here before.
it was some sort of dumpling with pork and chives? not on the dimsum order sheet. it was a special $4.99 order."}
{"text":"Not too shabby for $2 dim sum spot! 

Da Fu improved a lot from what I remembered last year. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the dishes. The portion was fair, and the food was not overall greasy like every other $2 dim sum spot.  The service wasn't slow, everything came out pretty much all at the same time. 

It's like a zoo in there during the weekends though. so come early for a spot!

They serve cold soy milk while you wait - sweet...."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant that opened in the same plaza as T&T at Middlefield and Steeles.

They have set dinners for a resonable prices. From $38.99 is a choice of 4 dishes with soup and dessert. I think the best value is the one for $88 that includes a 4-5 lbs lobster that can feed 6 people.

Since we only has 3 of us, we ended up order the $38.99 specials. The deep fried shrimps was the best with 12 big size butterflied shrimps. We were so surprised that there were so many shrimps. The hot pot with fish and tofu was good too!

However, the sweet and sour beef they over marinated it in baking soda. There were no texture at all left in the beef.. I really not sure if those are beef anymore!

They do serve dim sum during the day, I might drop by and try it one day.

CASH only!"}
{"text":"This dim sum restaurant is pretty good for the price. Most of the items are $2.58 (S/M/L), it is pretty cheap for a dim sum spot in Scarborough. I would give it a pass for this place, because I only like certain items. The rice roll with the fritter dough (Youtaio: ??) in the center is really fresh and tasty, It goes really well together with the soya, hoisin and peanut sauces that are given on the side. Another favorite at this place is their mini egg tarts. They are small, but each bite I take brings me to flavour town. It is flaky and the egg is cooked to perfection, whenever I crave for egg tarts I would go there in the morning and order two orders (3 mini egg tart per order) just for myself. I can never get tired of these mini delicacy.

Food: 3/5
Environment: 3/5
Service: 3/5
Cleanliness: 3/5

Overall: 3/5"}
{"text":"really only giving 3 stars for the price and value of the dimsum.  

the wait for the dimsum here is one of the worse things you can experience.  Prepare to wait 45 minutes in the most cramped quarters ever.  they put a giant table in the front for no reason that makes the entrance even tighter.   they have a tea station which is always empty or people cant even get to because its so cramped.    

but you do get what you pay for... its cheap dim sum which usually means its super packed.."}
{"text":"Went here on a mini road trip to T&T Middlefield. Ordered three dishes: shrimp in salad, pan fried taro cake, and ham sui kok. 

The taro cake tasted blah and when it cools down it is even worse. 
Their crispy shrimp with salad is excessively oily.  I had to take out the skin.  

Their ham sui kok had a weird smell for their meat.

MSG levels are off the roof at this restaurant as well.

Never coming here again on my own next time."}
{"text":"Food is decent, some items are hit and miss (sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf, thousand year egg congee... both big misses) // but the honey beef ribs and standard dumplings were good.

Overall 3/5 stars, I would say they are the average or just slightly below average for Markham/Richmond Hill dim sum food quality."}
