{"text":"Forced to go there for a birthday party, and it was even worse than the first time.

Pool tables so crammed together you cannot shoot a decent game.  Other pool tables pushed up the windows so we had to move all the tables and chairs out of the way.

Did not have food the first time, but others in the group did not think much of it.

Wings this time were some of the worst I have ever had.

Parking is a laugh.  Park and walk for a very, very long ways.  All parking in the front blocked off.

Too bad, since this place pops up on Groupon $10 for $20, but I guess they need to keep cruising for new customers.

Service was OK, but the rest of the place needs so much work and affects the server's tips.

Will only go back if forced....pool league or birthday party.

Tried to post with NO Stars, but it would not let me."}
{"text":"Honestly this place has the best burgers in town! I come here just for the burgers I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I generally don't write poor reviews, but I have been here several times and the service is always painfully slow - even when it is empty. Tonight, we watched our bartender socialize at the end of the bar with her coworkers. When we finally got her attention, she gave us attitude and barely took care of us. She looked at us like we were a waste of her time and just said \"what do you want?\". She wasn't personable at all. She didn't even give us her name. This is the third time that we've had a deathly slow server, but this one was downright rude."}
{"text":"Can you say DER !!!! I went to this place for the first time on Friday with some friends from work. A word of advice \"Dont hit on the waitresses\" or someones jealous boyfriend that works there will have you escorted out. Seriously!!  I wont return to this place merely on the fact that if you cant have some harmless bantor with the staff whats the point. Only your tips suffer. There are plenty of other places to spend my money."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I haven't sat on the inside, just the outdoor bar.  Maybe the inside is better but I have such a bad taste left in my mouth that I'll never know because I'll never go back.  There were about 10-12 people smoking outside. They have no rules or designated areas to smoke so people hover over the bar and anyone sitting there trying to enjoy themselves (or trying to eat the terrible food), are smoking right in your face. The smoke is so overwhelming that I felt sick to my stomach. On top of that, the very young bartenders were over-serving a group of about 8 or 9 people.  Three of the guys were so drunk that one was walking around barefoot, and the other two were slurring their words trying to fight each other. They were completely ruining the experience of every other guest there, drunkenly chain smoking in everyone's face and being obnoxious.  One of them almost burned me with his cigarette because he could barely hold himself up yet the bartenders kept serving him (shots of Fireball!!!).  I would never ever go back to this trashy, drunken, disgusting place again.  The drunks were over-served to the point of barely being able to stand, the bar-top hadn't been wiped since the place opened, and there was a $5 cover for all this.  No thanks, I'll go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"We have had great times on Saturday nites, dancing to country music with a DJ, but are now told \"No More Country except Thursdays\". Bummer."}
{"text":"Service not so great on New Year's Eve. Place practically dead. Little black dress contest and one of the contestants who won with no crowd recognition is dating the dj. Low crowd and the dj barely played top 40 until like 1am. Also, when we called in they said last week they would be giving away multiple prizes like Coach purses. They didn't. At this point I could think maybe the staff kept any \"prizes\". Watched the bartender pour me a double of a $7 shot that was barely dripping out of the bottle. It was barely a shot let alone a double, and then when I said something she just walked away. Bartenders were drinking on the clock, cut waitresses with no one to take over our table of 10 people trying to drink, and the ones working were hanging outside. Owners should look into their shady employees. Walked out on New Years SOBER!! 1st and last time here."}
{"text":"Bad service, food is average bar food and they treat their bands like they are disposable. Will never spend another dime in this place."}
{"text":"Bartender seemed inconvenienced to serve and was not social and rarely checked on us....This is the third time that the service was poor......we decided to go next door to the other bar."}
{"text":"Had been here in the past and was definitely disappointed.  My last visit a week or two ago was a welcome improvement.  They still have a few things to improve but are seemingly coming around.  Now, a little more attractive HH and you'll see me more often."}
{"text":"If I wasn't dragged here on an assignment, you can more than believe I wouldn't be seen within a mile of the place..... literally. I loved the girl in pajamas who tried hitting on us. I also loved the mean mugging Indian chick who called me a pretty boy because I was wearing a button up shirt. Her missing teeth were real attractive. The drinks were sugar heavy visions of diabetes in the future, I think my legs went numb before I left! Sadly, if you could take everything that stereotypes Mesa into one room and add a dash of homelessness, this was it. I will scratch my eyes out before I ever go there again!"}
{"text":"Food sucks. Chips stale. Shrimp taco unetable. Frys were good. If you want to eat don't come here. They have a bar and tons of tvs with sports on them if u only want to drink and watch a game"}
{"text":"Don't go there on a UFC fight night!  We got there 2 hours before the fights started and, they were \"supposed to be preparing that is why it took over 20 minutes for the waitress to come to us.  At this time it was slow.  As it got closer to fight time the place is packed.

 They were not prepared for this even tho when we called we were told to get there around 5 because it will be busy.  They had to close the kitchen because they couldn't keep up with the orders.  If you got there at 5 and ordered ate they take away your plates but, do not ask if you would like anything else the rest of the night,  Water down soda..yummy. 

Had to ask for the check at 9 since they were not going to wait on us anyway.  Watched the waitress maybe 10 minutes before the main event take the bills to tables.  Wow! so people are suppose to wait around with such horrible service.  Wonder how much they lost on people just walking out with out paying the bill."}
{"text":"I will not ever go to this bar or any other Graham Brothers venue.  Here's why. I was in this bar on Thursday Jan. 19 for a quick bite and a beer or 2.  It was a quiet night as there were almost as many staff as patrons at 6:30 or so. The atmosphere was ok & the service was good.  I was with my 27 YO daughter who had a sandwich that needed some Mayo.  It quicky arrived.  I was appalled however when the bill arrived & we were charged 25 cents.  It was a tiny portion of the bill but I could not get the manager to reverse the charge.  She said it was required to charge the Mayo fee by the kitchen, whatever that means.  What is next?  A ketchup charge (somebody needs to bring the bottles to the table), a napkin charge (it costs money to wash the cloth ones or roll up the paper ones), etc.  For not reversing the fee I will not go back, and if you need condiments on your meals encourage you to go elswhere."}
{"text":"A group of us went there for Free Poker with the Dream Dealers.  The servers greeted us and made a couple of suggestions.  Each of us tried something different and all of us were happy.  The fried zuccini appetizer was delivered so fast that I actually burnt my mouth!  By the end of the meal, the server knew all of our names and made us feel like regulars.  Every time we wanted a refill, the server was there and we couldn't have been happier.  I highly reccomend the Chicken Club or any of their salads."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time on a Saturday afternoon.  The place is huge and there were no people other than our group.  The burger was awful, the wings were great and the French dip was marginal at best.  We decided to go back on Friday.  BIG MISTAKE!  It was absolutely awful!  If you want to go have a beer or a drink and play some games, go for it!  Don't eat the food any of it!"}
{"text":"this is one of my fav spots bc its just that BAR... some  times u need good bar food TV/DRINKS nothting fancy but its clean so go rather then spend $100 on nothing."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs. Waited way over an hour for our order which never came out. Walked out of a restaurant for the first time ever."}
{"text":"Business closed. We tried to go here, but they were moving all the tv's and furniture out."}
{"text":"I had one of the most disappointing experiences at Cactus Moon in Mesa az on Sat night. From the time we stepped in the door the service was below average. It was like pulling teeth to get our first order in. This set the tone for the rest of the night. Finally after getting fed up and deciding to leave, I get home to see that they charged my card 5 times for my order. Not over charged... or even an extra drink. No, they overcharged me 500% above what I ordered. I will never return to this place and I would suggest you never do either. But IF you do, please check your bank account to make sure these thieves haven't stolen from you too!"}
{"text":"Cool place- lots of pool tables, but service was TERRIBLE. Absolutely horrible. Can't even tell you about the full menus because out apps were messed up, and the waitress just took them away- didn't attempt to replace them at all. Will come back for one more visit to redeem a gift card, and that's it. Will NEVER go back. Get your shit together."}
{"text":"I asked for extra crispy hot wings and received soggy, rubbery, undercooked chicken swimming in a pool of buffalo sauce. Spent the rest of the night and the following day in a fetal position as my stomach wouldn't stop hurting. I would never suggest this place to anyone. Ever."}
{"text":"Food was not good, service was either worse. Should have looked at the reviews before I went in. I could have gone to Cracker Barrel or Chili's instead."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever received! We came before a spring training game and the server forgot 2 out of 6 of our orders, there were no utensils, no refills or napkins without asking at least twice. We later came back after the game and while our last guy of the group of 6 was deciding what to order the server literally clapped in our face and said \"Guys can we please focus and order drinks? Youre NOT my only table of the night\". We had to ask for a different server to finally receive acceptable service."}
{"text":"we went out to this place because the web site stated they had dancing on fri and sat nights after 10pm....nothing...big dance floor and nothing...they said sry we don't have a dj....
service was good....nice pool tables but I came out to dance..."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend just had such a great experience at cactus it was a pretty big establishment for the amount of ppl in attendance,  but that didn't matter nikki went over and above her job as a server and was completely attentive and just had a great attitude we will definitely be back just due to this experience!!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place this week. My first experience was awesome. I came back the next day just to make sure my first visit was not a fluke. I ordered BBQ wings....best I ever had! The sauce was spicy and had quite a kick. I will be back!!! Great happy hour! See you guys soon!!!"}
{"text":"I went here at 8PM alone to watch the Coyotes last regular season game of 2011 - I'm a huge fan. I ordered wings, and they were really really good. Better than Zips, which is my go-to place for wings. The Bleu Cheese Dressing could be a little better, but eh, whatever.

The server was delightful and quick, especially considering how busy it was.

After 10, the place gets a little too bump and grind for me, with loud hip hop music and obnoxious fraternity and sorority people. 

I'll go back, a little earlier in the evening, for some awesome wings."}
{"text":"Tried this place once on a Saturday afternoon (between 2-4pm), it was dead. We sat at the bar and waited close to 15 minutes to acknowledged by a waitress and get a drink ordered. The drinks were good, but it took another 10 minutes to get our check. If it wasn't for the awful, slow service we would have probably stayed longer or purchased more items - but that didn't work out. 

Pros: 
- Location: Close to Cinemark to get a drink before a movie.
-.Mixed drinks: Their vodka drinks were delicious.

Cons:
- BAD SERVICE

The bad services was just too much to take and I will NOT be visiting this place again. I'll try other places nearby than to try this place again."}
{"text":"Want to wait an hour for a dozen wings?  Come to Cactus Moon on Wednesday night. The excuse for the ultra slow service? It's Dance Night and all the dancers order at the same time.  It takes 30 minutes to get a beer!!! My advice....avoid Cactus Moon on Wednesdays"}
{"text":"We used to go here all the time. Was never too crowded and played good music. Went a week ago and the 6 people we brought doubled their clientele. 

Bar tender refused to close our tabs. Like he was too busy to close the tabs. There was less than 30 people in the building on a Saturday night! Management was apologetic but doubt they took me seriously. I stopped and talked to the bartender who actually apologized. Ruined my night. Won't ever return."}
{"text":"Anyplace this big with this many TV's automatically gets three stars, but the Mesa crowd even a weekday was getting kind of sketchy. We wanted to play pool, but you can't play one game at a time and it is now 10 bucks for unlimited play. They have a few other games inside, but mostly alot of TV sets and they did have the volume on for Thursday night football. Cactus does not feature any food specials during happy Hour, but plenty of drink deals were available. Beers were about $2.50 or 3 bucks during football games. The only other issue is the urinals which are all child sized and offer no protection from the next dude (see photo). Invest in a divider, I know it's a Mesa bathroom, but at least invest in a divider."}
{"text":"Great place to get drunk, shake that ass, and shoot some pool. One of Mesa's hidden gems. Food doesn't suck either."}
{"text":"Nikki is awesome. Hands down some of the best bar service I've ever had!  The place is big and has a lot of games and a dance floor, good for big parties!"}
{"text":"I was in there on 5/17/14 at 6pm the male bartender was changing the Patron Chiller with 2 Big bottles of Patron. One side would not take anymore tequila so he jams his fingers into the hole on top of that machine were the liquor goes. If you want Patron that has had dirty fingers in it this is your bar. Then I called to speak to a Manager and the Girl who answered was extremely rude asking me why I wanted to speak to a General Manager. She said they were busy. So from the time I left to 5 minutes later when I called a tour bus must have stopped by and dropped off a bunch of people cause it was dead when we were in there 5 minutes prior to the call. So I will just let everyone know my experience instead of the General Manager. Would not recommend.."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! Great drinks and appetizer specials during happy hour, lots of tvs and a huge dance floor!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place. The food is terrible and pricey, The staff is pretty terrible and ticket times run slow even though there seems to be a lot of them there. The dance floor is nice, but I don't like how they play hip hop or as they call it \"Top 40.\"  With a name like Cactus Moon you think it would be straight country. The one great thing about this place is the pool table, they are great."}
{"text":"I have been here on three occasions so far, two to slam a few and once to eat and play pool. 

During happy hour they have the pool table for $6/hour, appetizers for $5/$6, and $2 domestic pints. I don't really care for their appetizer deals however. Oh yes, one can get a dozen of wings for $6 bucks I believe during HH as well. 

I did enjoy their chicken club sandwich, the bun was fluffy and not dense like some buns I hate. Waffle fries are pretty good too. 

As for the crowd, it was older than your average college crowd. (ASU is only like 4 miles away). It's an ok place, I'll only be back if I'm being dragged and someone else is paying."}
{"text":"This is a good place to catch a sport on tv.  Food is fair and prices are ok as well.  Service in my opinion is so-so.  After 10 p.m. on the weekends the place tends to attract a more ghetto crowd (drink specials maybe?)
If you've ever been to Graham Central Station on Elliot/10 then you've been here."}
{"text":"I am basing my review on everything but the food. I met a few friends there for March Madness. The place is huge! Definitely the largest Sports bar in the area. They have pool tables, shuffleboard, darts. Lots of T.V.'s. The waitress gave my friends coupons for the wings they ordered, which ended up being free. I thought that was nice. After we gave her a  generous tip (which she deserved for giving the coupon), she came back up to our table after taking our tab and thanked us again. Those little things are great for customer service. We will definitely try Cactus Moon again!"}
{"text":"This place sucks! I drank here more then enough times to be \"drunk\" but as soon as I go there to celebrate UofA's PAC 12 championship 2015, they decide to cut me off on drinks, along with all the shots I tried to buy for the entire bar. I don't believe they even comply with the Arizona compact, less the Arizona state lottery requirements. This place is bogus and prejudice to the university of Arizona."}
{"text":"There is nothing really great about this place.... The only reason i give 2 stars is because it's huge, which makes it a great place to watch multiple games! We went there for the fight (no cover) there must have been 7-10 bartenders working however my boyfriend and I were still ignored. We had to ask to order food drinks ect... Some of the bartenders were obviously beginners and seemed to lack training... Unfortunately I'll probably be back for football season, but I'm not going to beg to spend money. There are better quality places closer to my house."}
{"text":"Horribly slow service and average food. Wasn't even crowded and we could see from our table that bar wasn't busy, but drinks took 30 min .. Won't go back"}
{"text":"This place has some great music, awesome buffalo wings and excellent drinks - cheap! I have never had drinks made so well and been so inexpensive. The staff is awesome and this place is great. They have a full dance floor, plenty of pool tables and good times all the way around. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place has so much potential but didn't live up to my expectations. We stopped in on Saturday night and the first impression was walking in the door and the bouncer and cashier asked for a $5 cover.  The bouncer said \"Or you guys don't have to pay cover if you give her a $5 tip\".  Seemed a little sketchy but we agreed.  Then we went to the bar and watched the bartenders walk past us like 20 times without asking if they could get us anything.  There were a few people at the bar but they weren't that busy and could have noticed we weren't helped yet.  I finally flagged one down and she took my order.  We noticed the fussball tables in the back and decided to go play.  I was pretty excited since I hadn't played since I was a kid.  There was no change machine in sight.  Kind of weird to have tons of pool tables and fussball tables and not have a few change machines in plain sight.  So we had to ask a server for change because we knew we weren't going to be able to get the bartenders attention.  Put in the change and only 8 balls pop out. So the final score was 5-3.  Fairly uneventful.  We then went over by the dance floor and there are two couples who look like they should be on dancing with the stars out there.  It was fun to watch for a while but then I realized everyone else was way too intimidated to go out there and dance when you have professional dancers spinning around the entire floor.  I know they can't do much to control that.  So we decided not to go back to the bar to pick up another beer and just head next door to Toby Keiths instead.  That place was packed and had great service.  Cactus Moon needs to stay competitive and straighten some things out."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential it's a shame they are running it into ground. We have tried it a handful of times now since it is close to my new home. Very much of a disappointment. It seems to get worse and worse every time we go. At this point the DJ that they have playing won't take requests and the manager refused to change the music. There was no one dancing and the place was almost empty. You think they would make some changes to fill this place up. It doesn't make any sense. The waitstaff is horrible but the bartenders seem to be very nice and on top of things"}
{"text":"Their burgers are tasty. Not the best I've had, but good for the price. Our server was friendly and dropped by to make sure we were happy on a regular basis. I wasn't a huge fan of the atmosphere, too much country music for my tastes. They have lots of pool tables and a few bigger games like free throws and boxing games, and plenty of TVs showing whatever games are on.

The one real gripe I have with the place is that nobody seems to clean the tables, there were crumbs and old drips of ice cream that I had to clean myself."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and after last night, don't think I will be going back.  The waitresses were very busy...sitting at a table shooting the breeze while our food sat in the window. Ordered hot wings. Thêse were mushy, overcooked (imagine that) wings. Supposed to be buffalo. More like a semi spicy rub. No sauce. Then our \"entrees\" came. He ordered a Burger with coleslaw on it. The slaw was so runny, it had the bottom bun mutilated by the time it got to the table. I ordered a French dip. This was hardly a French dip...chopped up beef brisket on an undercooked but overgrilled bun with a teaspoon of cheese. The only thing that wasn't screwed up was the fries and beer. Last time we were there, the waitress knocked over a draft beer which proceeded to run all down the table right into my lap. No offer of a towel or napkins.  The only thing I do like is all the TVs.  But getting them to put on your game is like trying to pull a tooth from a bull!! Seems only one person in the whole place knows how to use the remote....good luck finding that person....will NEVER go back again..."}
{"text":"it's funny- i try and not make the mistake of reading reviews while im at a particular restaurant because i dont want my view to be skewed going into it.. but these reviews were pretty spot on, it is kind of a trashy place and my food was well.. just not good. i ordered the queso dip and chips, which really, i dont know how you can screw up, but the queso was gross and the chips were burnt. left a bad taste in my mouth. i will say in their defense, $1.50 beers can't be beat."}
{"text":"Wow...I'm not quite sure how this place stays in business. The single star is not a reflection of the quality of the fare or the drink selection. I actually am not in a position to review the food or beer. Because I was never served. I was never even approached by a waitress. Oh, that's not entirely true. At one point in the twenty five minutes that I waited before giving up, a waitress came stumbling by carrying beers asking \"Did anyone order a Bud Light? Who ordered the Bud Light?\" I was half tempted to take one, knowing that the poor sap who ordered it probably left an hour earlier. Seriously, with all the places to watch games in the Valley, there is simply no reason to waste your time with this place..."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I've ever been here and seen more than 30 people in the whole place. I'm a little surprised it lasted longer than Toby's next door.
The service is just fine and the drinks aren't stupid expensive. It's also nice to have a billiards place near by. But what about the dancing they advertise? Last time I came for it and the server said they \"were coming\" but by midnight... no dice. The food was also greasy and disappointing, but hey, it's a sports bar what do you expect? If I want to play pool and have a beer then sure, but besides that I'll pass. 
I also hear they play the UFC fights, so if that's your sort of thing, then maybe it'll be better for you!"}
{"text":"Good food and the waitresses are nice expedite. Poker on Tuesdays make me a constant fan. 

Really enjoy the chicken ceasar salads!"}
{"text":"Good happy hour. Great place for fights. Terrible parking situation since the beginning of construction on new buildings."}
{"text":"This is my go to laid back bar. Bar tenders and bouncers are friendly. Easy to get a pool table. Good drink specials. Fried pickles are killer...UPDATE.. the shrunk their menu WAY down and no more fried pickles :(."}
{"text":"Can you say ghetto?  In grad school, my friends and I went to the Cactus Moon on Tucson all the time.  It was a great mix of upbeat country music and the latest fun dance tune and a little hip hop.
The Mesa crowd is thuggish and rough.  The back of the bar has games, foozeball tables, pool tables and lots of tvs.  Tvs are everywhere.The drinks are reasonably priced.  No one dances at all during the country songs (I think those that like country should just go to Tobey Keith's which is right next door).  When hip hop was finally played, the dance floor was pretty crowded.  The place is kept a bit on the warm side, and all was good until literally a fight broke out.  Not just any ol little fight, but a beer bottle throwing (there was so much glass one of my girlfriend's had her legs totallly cut up), chair/stair throwing melee.  
I have never ever seen so many people want to jump in on a fight.  The police were called and the entire bar was evacuated.  Ridiculous.  There is nothing redeeming about this place.  Save yourself the experience and go to Scottsdale.  (Never thought I'd say that in a million years, but seriously skip this place!!!)"}
{"text":"Worst place!!!  Surprised has not been shut down yet. Servers are completely clueless, they ignore you and are more interested in talking to friends and having fun.  I asked for a cheese burger and the next question I was asked was; do you want cheese on that?  Even when the place is not busy you can walk in and sit at a table for nearly half an hour before a server even takes a drink order.  

On top of that management does not know what they are doing either. Avoid this place at all costs as you will be very disappointed in the service, food, and simply the overall experience."}
{"text":"Came here after a spring training game to watch some more sports and get some grub. Our watiress was nice, but no refills and our food never came after an hour. The manager came out and we thought she would apologize, but instead she tried to explain to us how a restaurant works (we've all worked in restaurants.) She was unbelievably rude and didn't try to remedy the situation at all. Still no refills. Still no food. So we went across the way to Matta's Cantina & Grill. We were immediately greeted and given waters and chips & salsa. I can't believe this place is in business. I can't believe people can just be so flat out mean-spirited. Don't go here. Ever. Go to Matta's next door. Or even Chili's. Or McDonalds."}
{"text":"Great opportunity to be something special. Came for Arizona elite 8 game. Place wasn't packed, plenty of open seats. 

We ordered nachos 3 minutes into first half. With 12 minutes left IN THE GAME the food still hadnt come. The manager came out with excuses and was extremely rude. We asked if we could just get some chips and salsa while we waited for nachos and she snooted, \"no because our business works in order of who ordered first\" ....

the waitress was sweet but had zero training. One of our waters had some kind of soda in it as well. I'm sure if you just order drinks (which we did have drinks as well) the experience could be better, but the bathrooms were disgusting, the kitchen only had 12 tickets visible and we didn't get food for over 1.5 hours, and management doesn't look to solve problems but instead show muscle. 

We watched the last 5 minutes of game across street in Mexican restaurant. We got drinks, food and our tab before we knew what happened. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place. One of the TVs is even polorized and everything has a blue tint....wtf?"}
{"text":"The owner's of Cactus Moon are self destructive morons.

Friday nights have been developing a good country dance scene. Lots of people show up for a free lesson and dance afterwards. They have fun, buy food, drink, and have been telling friends how wonderful the place is (despite bad Yelp reviews). 

So, last Friday the owners waited until everybody arrived for the Friday dance -- and then announced that for now on they will only play hip-hop and top40. People that came here for their Friday night dance were furious -- and most of them stormed out.

Count on at least 60 people to tell every one of their friends how callous and unfriendly Cactus Moon is. The owners could have made an announcement the previous week, so that people's night wouldn't be ruined, but that would have shown too much respect and consideration for their customers. CM owners wanted to be sure to let everyone there know that their loyal patronage isn't needed or even wanted.

Oh, and the owners justified their actions by saying that dancers don't generate enough revenue. Of course it couldn't be that the food and service sucks!

Businesses that treat customers with such disdain usually go out of business. The Phoenix market is just too competitive for idiots like this to survive. I cannot imagine that a bunch of oblivious young hip hoppers will save the day for CM, but we shall see what we see!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was because I visited this place for the first time on a Tuesday. I wasn't a big fan."}
{"text":"*  Hostesses are children trying to act like adults
*  Service is slow (painfully slow)
*  Employees all have an attitude and not a good one
*  Mediocre food
*  Watered down drinks
*  Expensive drinks
*  Overall dirty and sticky
*  Restrooms on one corner of the structure which is about 100 yards from some tables.
*  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"It was a ghost town. The menu was one small page, very few options for lunch or appetizers. The service here is really lacking. I went for lunch with my wife and we split a salad and an appetizer. The food was not good, the salad was only lettuce. The server was rushed and rude. We continued to have to ask the bartender for forks, ranch a refill on our water... I would not recommend this place for lunch. The reason for the 2 stars though, is the atmosphere may be fun with a group of friends to play pool and go dancing."}
{"text":"We were becoming regulars at Cactus Moon.. thought we found a great dance / Eating place. lately not so much. went in twice this week both times what we ordered off the menu they didn't have. We were told dancing is Wednesday - Saturday around 8pm - 9pm. We went in Thursday night when we were seated we asked about the dancing they said it would be a little later due to March madness. We had dinner waited around (9:30p) We were then told it would be 10p... We went across the street to Toby Kieth's.. great band.. great dancing...We left at 10:20pm, Cactus Moon still had no dancing. A little more consistensy would be nice. Seems like they are trying to be everything to everyone. Sports Bar/Night Club. Until they choose don't see them building either type of Clientele. Too many other places to go right in thier own back yard, literally."}
{"text":"I am obsessed about whether or not I can ride my bike to go hang out with friends. This is my \"hop on the bike and go\" place. There's pool tables, delectable wings and pulled pork sandwiches, and a billion TV's. My favorite bartender is Nikki.

Friday nights at Riverview is Bike Night and Cactus Moon is in the middle of it all. Have a drink on their patio while listening to live music and admiring motorcycles, or drive your own and put it on display.

You can bring your kids if you like, but realize Friday nights are Ladies Night, so leave the kiddos home on that night. I love this place to watch sports and meet up with friends."}
{"text":"This place is a joke- their service is TERRIBLE. We sat and waited for 40 minutes for anyone to come check on us (by that time, we just wanted to see how long it would take them to notice our presence) and when our server finally got there, she informed us that they hadn't realized they were missing a server. What manager has his head so far up his @$$ that he doesn't notice when his staff doesn't show for a scheduled shift?

My favorite part? Constantly noticing servers gathered chatting by the POS systems at the bar, including the bartenders! No wonder their service sucks- they're too busy having meetings of their social club.

The food? Meh. Nothing great. Not awful, but really, I can get this stuff anywhere. 

Save your time and frustration and go to Toby Keith's across the way."}
{"text":"The place is wallpapered with big screen TVs and has nice pool tables. The atmosphere is only tolerable at night because of the way the light comes in during the day... you just can't see anything around you. I've only had one meal there and it was just average, but the kicker was that when I saw on the menu that I could \"Add a side salad for $1.99\" and apparently it replaces the fries when you do that. Yes, you read correctly! I even spoke to the manager to confirm that the french fries that were supposed to come with my meal were no longer included since I added a side salad for an additional cost of $1.99. I couldn't believe it, but the manager insisted it was so. I shan't eat there again!"}
{"text":"Added a star for effort, since the manager messaged me about the experience and seemed legitimately concerned. They'll have a chance to make up for the last visit when football season rolls around again, but not before."}
{"text":"first time here and was an \"ish\" experience... the bartenders were just standing around not doing a whole lot when i came in, so i sat at the bar... it then took aprox 5-10 minutes before one of them walked over to ask what i wanted... once i got my beer my friends got there so we grabbed a table... our waitress was great, no issues there... after a while i walk by the bar and decided to get a couple of shots and again it took too long for a bartender to even recognize i was there... its just not acceptable! maybe if i had a set of double D'd i'd get served faster........."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!  Will never go there again!  My fiance and I have been here numerous times for lunch and it was always nice and service good.  Tonight being a Friday night we went for dinner.  We are senior people and the place had only young people in there and wasn't busy at all.  We walked in and were not greeted by anyone so seated ourselves at a dirty table and after a bit a waitress came up and asked if we wanted to sit there or be seated at a clean table.  We chose the clean table where we sat for 15 minutes and completely ignored.  A group of young people came in and were given their menus even before they fiished sitting down!  Not happy here.  After about 4 more minutes a waitress asked if we wanted something to drink.  My fiance ordered a rum and coke and I ordered a glass of chardonay.  When she brought it my glass was NASTY dirty and sticky!  My fiance asked for a new glass and we ordered but were still completely ignored the entire evening.  We will NEVER and I mean NEVER go back there again and seniors of Arizona I warn you, stay away!"}
{"text":"Will only give one star. Went this past Saturday for ufc was told over the phone no cover before 6 so all 8 of us went over there about 5pm we were already at a pretty big tab, we were then told we all had to pay a cover for the fights talked to the manager they didnt seem to want to honor what we were told on the phone......so beware when they tell you no cover before a certain time we will never be back....."}
{"text":"The food is okay, best thing on the menu is easily the Wachos (nacho style waffle fries). It's a solid bar with plenty on tap and good selection of mixed drinks. The service is spotty though.

There are plenty of televisions and the staff is pretty good about changing the channel to a good game. The pool tables aren't cheap, but make for a fun night. They also have a shuffle board table to spend a couple of hours."}
{"text":"I have made a point of visiting Cactus Moon for football Sundays frequently over the last football season. Service, while friendly, was often slow, and the food, while good, was never outstanding. This past Sunday, I went in right after the morning game started, wearing my team colors, to play pool and watch my game. I asked for pool balls and got them right away, then set up at a table. There were only two other patrons playing pool at the time, and all other patrons were watching games in the bar area.

All the pool tables were damaged in some way...some had tears, all had stains from spills. I was never approached by a waitress even though there were probably 8 or 10 servers in the establishment. Once I got a server's attention, she brought me a menu and the water I requested. Then I noticed that my chosen game was on a tv far from the pool tables, but two of the tvs in the pool area were tuned to the same game. All were marked for particular games, but at least two were showing games other than what was marked.

I asked my waitress to have one of the duplicate tvs tuned to my game, since literally no one else was in the pool area besides the other two guys, and all other patrons were in the bar area. I was told that \"It might be a while, the manager is getting a lot of requests to change the channel, and these tvs are already marked for certain games, but she knows about it. It might be a few minutes.\" I had been answered in a similar way last year...in fact, it seemed the manager at that time was even a little hostile about being asked, according to my server that day.

I waited ten minutes for the change that wasn't coming, then decided to pack up and leave without ordering. I won't be back. This is the second year in a row that I have been given excuses about changing the channel in a dead bar with minimal patrons in it, and it is the last time I waste a football Sunday on this place.

It troubles me that so little attention is paid to the paying customers at Cactus Moon; the servers either are not trained to approach, or don't care for some other reason. No patron should have to track down a server in a place that isn't even half full, and changing a channel should have been no problem, especially considering the lack of customers in the place. My game could have been on all but one screen (the one the 2 other guys wanted to watch) in the pool table area and disappointed nobody. But instead, they lost a customer due to plain old neglect.

I wish Cactus Moon would get its act together. I really like the format, the size, and the number of pool tables and tvs. It's sad to see it waste away like this. 

I hope it gets better, but for now...no thanks."}
{"text":"Overall my experience was pretty negative here. Walking in the atmosphere and wait staff were all pretty inviting which saves the night. However the appetizer was bland (we got the sampler) and took over 25 Mins for fried food that was only ok. We ended up ordering our food to go because it took so long. Overall I would suggest this place if you have a lot of time to kill or are only looking for beers an a pool table, the dining service is definitely secondary to the staff."}
{"text":"No specials on Sunday.

One TV on west side of bar is broken (color is way off). One TV on patio broken. Some of the others have shadowing and others are fuzzy. Decent sound though.

No paper towels in bathroom (air dry only).

Lots of bar games.

No HH food.

This could be a really cool place..."}
{"text":"Service sucked. Was handed a menu to look at, but the bartender never came back to see if I wanted to order from it, had to flag her down when she was bringing someone else's food in the area, then I hate that I sat there with an empty beer glass for about 10 min wondering where she had gone. Then when I wanted to pay my tab, that was another wait. I could have easily walked out. Then I let her know I needed my tab, waited some more while I watched her stop to get someone else their beer, check her cell phone and have a brief convo with another patron all with my tab in her hand. I can honestly say I will not ever go back. I hate that I spent more of my time waiting on service than enjoying my beers. I had a friend come pick me up and offered to buy him a drink. He said no we will go somewhere else, that place has horrible service. Lmao... all before me telling him of my experience."}
{"text":"I'm alumni of the University of Florida and the Desert Gators alumni associating hosts the gator football games here.  For a sports bar is not bad at all,  never a line for drinks either.  I never ousted food here abs I stopped doing that at bars.  They usually aren't any good and I don't want to give them a bad review for trying things I normally don't buy. Defiantly enjoy this place a lot."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times now, and I think its A-Ok.  I like coming here for a variety of reasons, as its a fun place to hang out at for just about anyone.

Its a sports bar, with lots of TV's hanging from the walls, waitresses dressed nicely, a bar and an outside patio.  They have plenty of pool tables you can rent by the hour for $6, which is awesome! Plus, since they have so many tables, its not like you have to wait for anyone to finish thier game to get in a game yourself.

The food here is medicore..I mean, they have a decent menu, but the food isn't going to blow your mind away.  Typical bar food, like nachos, wings, sliders and all that stuff. I like it here because even with all the TVs, dart boards and pool tables, you can have a conversation and not be drowned out by noise.

They usually have decent drink specials and a full bar, so thats pretty darn cool.  Service is quick and efficent, so no worries there.  I will be back in the future for more, trust me!"}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday for dinner during Spring Training.  I was very surprised that there weren't more people, considering how packed the nearby hotels were.  The space is very large and has an industrial feel.  Despite that we felt very welcomed by out lovely server.  

We ordered the wachos, a delicious nacho-type appetizer (substituting waffle-cut fries for the chips).  The turkey club was a hit too!  We had three meals,  a desert, and a few beers for about $45."}
{"text":"Visited twice in the same week during a business trip. In each case, the service was great, we split the bill 5-ways since we had a per-diem (you're awesome Brooke!).

The food was good for the price. Pool tables, Foosball, & TVs everywhere!

The brisket Philly cheese was different and tasty!"}
{"text":"This is my first bar out in Arizona since it was my first time visiting this state. Me and a friend snuck out the backdoor of the wedding reception we were at to check out the UFC193 fight. This place was really packed. It was hard to order a drink from the bar but of course that's understandable. Once I did order a drink from the bar, I never received it til 10 minutes later. Apparently the female bartender thought I was given the drink. She went to pour me a drink and brought it to me. I didn't bother going back to the bar after that. This place is pretty big. A lot of T.V.'s throughout the establishment and a good amount of pool tables to play with. 

There's a few thing's that I wasn't too fund about. The bartenders not being as friendly and not receiving my drink when I paid in full. And they only accept cash at the front for cover charges?. It's 2015. We are in the digital world. I shouldn't have to pay a fee to retrieve some money for their ATM. Any who, I do want to visit this place again next time I'm here. 

One thing that I did really like was that they had a menu with specials which majority of places don't have during special events like fight nights. Discounted selected food items and drinks which is always good."}
{"text":"Giant place - it'd be interesting to see it sometime actually filled with people."}
{"text":"10 dollars for eight wings....sports bar that won't turn the sound on instead to play terrible country music in the background....and the waitress lying about their satellite \"being broken\" for the reason the sound on one of their 100 tv's couldn't be turned on with sound...not to mention I heard the conversation between or server and the manager who clearly stated no with out explanation....just don't like getting lied too...we used to go here all the time for UFC with the two dollar beers at the outside patio with no cover...now...shitty country music...overpriced food as lying ass wait staff....count me out"}
{"text":"Had some Honey BBQ wings. The wings were great, but it took some time for them to get there, and one our party didn't get in time as we play poker out there. They should not promise delivery of food that you can't eat while you are playing. Now, they made up for it, even though they wanted to serve he re-heated. The margaritas are $5 during Happy Hour and are mighty tasty. Will report again as Tuesdays pass by.."}
{"text":"I fail to see any redeeming value in this place, which sucks, because it's super close to my house and I would love to have a kick-ass sports bar within 1/2 a mile.

because i don't want to write a novel, I'll do this in bullet-point;

  - Waited 5-10 minutes to be seated, and they were not even half full. 

  - Waited another 20 minutes to see a server

  - No pitchers of beer. Even though they're a sports bar. Wha????

  - Took so long to bring drinks / take our order, my brother went up to the bar himself, got a beer, and was halfway through it at our table before the waitress returned with our original drink order.

  - Food was gross. Buns for sliders half-stale. \"Buffalo chicken\" looked like it was a flat, frozen Tyson pattie. Sweet Potato fries were obviously from frozen as well; no taste, crunchy on the outside, and way too gooey on the inside. I couldn't even eat 3. And i love sweet potato anything. 

  - got a mixed drink at the bar after our meal, and it was ridiculously weak. And we ordered top-shelf, so it wasn't cheap. My Sapphire & Tonic was basically tonic with a lime... for like $7. 

Bottom line? Avoid. Run far, far away and don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where all the negative reviews are coming from.  I'm a foodie but not a food snob....  Hubby is neither.  Surprisingly, we were both satisfied here!  We came in on a groupon that allowed us to order appetizers, entrees, drinks and desserts.  We were seated very quickly and greeted by our waitress, Heather, within minutes. We ordered the tri sampler and it was great, (BBQ wings, fried zucchini & mozzarella sticks) totally typical bar food. Next came our drinks, 2 margaritas, and this is the only place where we knocked a star. They were so weak I order a shot of Patron to add to mine...and I am not a drinker. Our entrees came quickly.  The grilled mahi-mahi with guacamole was perfectly cooked, just a little salty for my taste. The steamed veggies were yummy too.  Hubby's French dip was good and the sweet potato fries were crisp and fluffy.  Dessert was a cheesecake - typical, but yummy.  Heather, our server was stellar.  We would definitely go back for a casual night with friends.  Oh and on Saturday nights, there is a car show that happens right outside Cactus Moon - with live music.  And the misters keep you cool. :)"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and had 2 different experiences. The first time we liked what the menu looked like so we had lunch here.  Food was good, standard bar food so nothing overly special but good. Service was decent, it was not busy so we were checked on regularly.  We found out they have the UFC fights so we wanted to go here to watch them. Fight night; we show up and it is $10 per person! What!?! Every other place in EV only charges $5/pp. We were already there and they were just about to start so we stayed. Next our waitress informs us that she needs a credit card or id as a security for the table. What?!? We are a 40 something couple, you think we are going to dine-and-dash...really. After a bit of discussion, I reluctantly give up my card. Then the fights start but because it is March Madness, not all the TV's are turned to the fight as they said they would be. So I have to crank my neck in order to watch them, even after the game ended they still did not turn the tv's. 
The food again was ok and service was good so we will go back for food but not to watch a fight, I will stick with Old Chicago or Tilted Kilt for my UFC viewing."}
{"text":"I don't know about this place.  I like that it's big, and has HUGE flat screen TVs at the bar, but it's actually TOO big.  It's like being a wharehouse.  It's definitely packed on the weekends, and if you live in Mesa you'll probably end up here or at Toby Keith's or both.  Glad I don't live in Mesa.  I'm curious to see what's it's like for watching football on Sundays.  Tons of pool tables too.  I'm just not sure they can do enough business mid-week to justify paying the rent and utlities on a giant wharehouse for a bar."}
{"text":"I went here last night and it was a pretty fun time. I went with a bunch of friends at around 9 oclock and it was busy all the way until we left at around 1 am. This place is huge! It is in a good location (close to my house) and has plenty of parking. It is a really big bar with a dance floor and a bunch of pool tables. My party of 7 easily got a table, despite it being busy, due to this place being really big. They had a mardi gras party last night that was pretty fun. All the servers were dressed up and they had a free king cake and gave away prizes for people that found the babies in the cake. They had great drink specials, 3$ long islands, hurricanes, and you call its. The first hurricane I got was really good... just enough alcohol to where it still tastes good. The second was terrible.... tasted like cheap rum.... way too much alcohol (and maybe i'm the only person in the world that would complain about that but... yuck). Some people got some food and said it was not so good. They got chicken skewers, queso dip, and an appetizer sampler. I would say that this place is not really a place to eat.... The music was pretty good, a mix of country with line dancing and whatnot and hip hop with regular club like dancing. I thought the place was fun and I would definitely go back.... just not for food."}
{"text":"Ok, I gave this place THREE chances.  I am not very judgemental on restaurants because I am a former server and I tend to look on the bright side.  However, I HAVE to comment on this place.  The first time I went, it was for the Bears game.  They had just opened and hadn't even had their \"grand opening\".  Service sucked, but we gave them the benifit of the doubt because they JUST opened.  

Second time I went was after a Cubs spring training game where they were being advertised a lot.  We actually had to ask the manager for service.  Then we were not taken care of at all after that, probably because she was embarased. 

Third and final time was for a final four March Madness game.  Once again we had to ask the manager for service!! 

Each time I was there we waited at least 20-30 minutes before someone served us, and that was only because we asked.  Then once we were served, the service sucked!!  Each time I was there, it wasn't very crowded, yet the service was so slow!  

The food wasn't very good because it was sitting at the window so long, it was turning cold.  To top it off...the waitress got my brother to order a big brownie thing with ice cream and the brownie was cold!!! 

Nice try Cactus Moon...you could have been a great place to watch games, but you loose!!!  Train your waiters/waitresses better PLEASE!!"}
{"text":"Really nice people...manager gave us free brownie samples that were incredible!  Tons of tvs!  Awesome dance floor!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. Bar, pool and Foosball and dancing for the ladies. The price was a little expensive but it was nice playing pool with my buddies while the girls were off dancing across the room. I would go again for sure."}
{"text":"Went there on Friday night, food was ok but waitress was nice and personable.  Music was good but no people were there to make it more fun.   I was soooooooo glad there was no country music."}
{"text":"I have been to Cactus Moon a few times, and it is now time to rate it.  Cactus Moon is definitely one of the biggest Sports Bars I have been to size wise.  Even though its a Sports Bar, it has a dive bar type of feel to it as well.  Cactus Moon is quite popular on Bike Night, which is Friday nights.  Half of the bar is setup with some bar tables near TVs to watch games.  This section late at night kind of turns into a mini dance floor, which is cool if you want to get your groove on.  The middle of the area is a large bar, and the wait time is very reasonable with bar attendants very attentive to their customers.  Lastly, you have a myriad of pool tables on the second half of the bar.  

Basically, you can definitely find something fun to do here between watching sports games, dancing, drinking, or shooting some pool."}
{"text":"This place sucks, service sucks, music sucks, mixed drink was ok, but not worth a return visit. Why in the hell would you put a country themed bar right across from another one?"}
