{"text":"This is our 3rd time coming here which is a compliment in itself. Most places we only go to once and never come back. The tacos are the best we've had in this area. They're on the smaller side but have good flavor. The service has been great every time we've visited."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant if you can call this place that I have ever been to. When you go in the cashier was super rude and the menu has the wrong prices on them. My friend and I ordered two breakfast burritos with bacon egg and potatoes no beans and rice first thing she does it write it down and still gets the order wrong. And when she brings it out she says the two burritos are different and I said they should be the same and she then starts saying you never said that and just stood there. And when she finally brought the right burrito out they made it half the size of my friends which we had gotten the exact same one. When I got home she gave me beans still in the burrito. NEVER EVER COME HERE plenty of other good restaurants near by that have good customer service and actually give you what you pay for. Also the food took 20+ mins the first time and 10+ mins the second time. Recommend that everyone boycott this place."}
{"text":"They charge $.50 cents if you pay with a card. That should be illegal.  It's their business and they should pay for the responsibilities of owning a business. Merchants agree to terms when they decide they want to accept credit cards as payment therefore they are they ones paying the fee and shouldn't pass that fee down to the consumer. Are they paying taxes on these fees they charge?.plus is the 21st century WwhoTF!! carries cash this days!! Plus this restaurant does not have AC they have a cooler which is hot and humid. How cheap can they get!! I'm not coming back bad experience. Speak up people and I hate that this happens most of the time in areas where most people earn below the poverty level."}
{"text":"Not recommended /no recomendable 
We came back home very disappointed with our take out after 40 minutes waiting for our food. I honestly don't think it takes that long to make two tacos and three gorditas when there is only us and another family in the whole restaurant, what really upset us is that after that long waiting they tell us that they got something wrong with the order and that we had to wait more. We just took what they had and left. I wouldn't recommend this place anymore the food taste great but the service is very poor.
Regresamos a casa con nuestra orden para llevar muy decepcionados después de esperar 40 minutos para nuestra comida realmente no creo que tome tanto tiempo para hacer dos tacos y tres gorditas con solo otras tres personas en el restaurante , ya hemos venido aquí antes y la espera es casi lo mismo lo que realmente nos molesto fue que después de tanto esperar nos dijeran que el cocinero se había equivocado y que tendríamos que esperar más, nos fuimos con lo que ya estaba hecho. La comída es buena pero el servicio es malo muy tardado para siempre estar vacío
No lo recomiendo para nada me hizo pasar un mal momento ."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood so we decided to try out the new restaurant. You can tell it's a new restaurant as soon as you walk in ... and it has a peculiar smell. It's not a bad smell but not an inviting one either. The salsa was very very bland and they only have one main green liquidy one . We asked for hotter salsa and we got some plastic squeeze bottles with what seemed to be a hot version of some sort of more green something .. maybe avocado but maybe not ... shrug. we ordered carne asada fries and a half chicken half chorizo huarache-- Very thin version of what I consider a huarache. I can say best was the chicken the chorizo and the carne asada was a thin shave so i didn't have all the chewy fat. Other then that the food was bland. The beer needs to be colder. I'm thinking breakfast burritos might be good here. The waitress was great ! Very friendly and very accommodating."}
{"text":"I usually come to this place at least once a month but I think this might be the last one, I had to wait at least 30 min for my food, plus awful customer service. (The employees are just on their phones and talking/laughing to each other) not happy at all."}
{"text":"Wow. I will be back. Wandered into this place when shopping @ frys electronics. Great tasting homemade food, large portions. Very friendly and helpful server. The lamb menudo was excellent. Entrée were large, very tasty and clearly made fresh to order. Can not say enough good things about this place. Yummm."}
{"text":"The pork in red sauce quesadilla was recommended by the server, and was amazingly delicious! Like an inside out enchilada, with giant homemade tortillas. The salsa is cool and refreshing, flavorful and not spicy- just how I like it! 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Disappointing 

We stopped into Machete Azteca for lunch and we were  seated immediately. Our server took our drink order and a hot basket of chips and salsa were brought to our table as we looked at our menus.

The chips and salsa were not the best. I like salty chips and spicy salsa. These had neither.  In fact the salsa tasted just like crushed tomatoes poured directly from a can.

For the main course, my lunch companion and I ordered the rolled tacos, rice, and beans. We waited about 20 mins and our entrees were delivered to the table. As we began to ate our lunch, we both realized that our food was cold, really cold.  We asked our server if our entrees could be heated, she said no problem.  About 15 minutes later our entrees were brought out and once again the food was lukewarm at best. 

Even if our entrees were hot; it would not have made a difference the food was bland and tasteless. The beans snd rice had little to no flavor, however, the rolled tacos were okay.  To enter a positive note the wait staff are helpful, friendly, and accommodating. However, the food, far below average."}
{"text":"After spending an hour at the electronics store, I was hungry.    Asked Yelp were the nearest Mexican restaurant was which led me here.  It was between the lunch hour and dinner so it was pretty empty.

I ordered the Horchata for drink and it made the grade.  How a humongous burrito which was good I needed to make sure I finished it!

Service was good and they kept our chips full."}
{"text":"Friendly service, busy but she kept up just fine. Great music had me dancing in my chair. Ordered two street tacos, pollo and carne asada. A bit greasy, but delicious, small just like from a cart on the side of the road. Given two squeeze bottles, green and red. Red is SPICY, I love it. Green not so spicy but its tasty too. Bowl of Menudo is HUGE, served with dry spices and chilies. Had to take most of it to go. Horchata is a little on the sweet side, but good. They have both english and spanish menus, accidentally grabbed the spanish but she answered my questions readily. I'll be sure to drop in when at Christown/Spectrum."}
{"text":"Wow what a surprise!! This place is good. Nothing fancy but great authentic flavors. Had the pork quesadilla.... life changer. Lol. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"By far rhe best Mexican food in town...great beans and rice definitely homemade just like there corn tortillas. ..everything I've had on their menu has been amazing I strongly suggest getting the steak and onions quesadilla and the grilled beef tacos and always get the rice and beans...the meat is tender and so flavorful and juicy it's excellent. .....the only flaw is that the waitresses don't speak very good English so I recommend no SUPER SPECIAL orders and you will be very happy...the foods as good as you would get in Mexico if not better!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here the other night for the first time, the guy and girl working were amazing, brought us out samples of meats to try and customer service rocked!!!! Will be back"}
{"text":"Lovely and friendly service, over all giving this place 2 stars for physicaly sick employees , waitress / cashier coughing AS they hand you over your food, when it came to pay our total bill for the food. She cashier almost even pushed my hand down towards the counter when she gave me my change back. I get it we all have some bad days at work, don't take it out on us."}
{"text":"I finally found a Mexican food restaurant that is authentic and is on MY SIDE OF TOWN! now i can drive 5 minutes down the road for my hang over cures instead of 30 minutes! They serve delicious chips and salsa while you order and wait for your food, but save your stomach space because you will need it for the delicious food that awaits you! I tried Their Menudo and Cauldo De Res!  Their soups are very concentrated(most soups are watered down) and their soups have really flavorful meat, and they balanced their soup portions well, for the first time i ordered Cauldo de res and i didn't get all a little meat and all carrots or menudo with all harmony! it was all balanced out and portions are pretty big! Our server was fast and attentive! Our Drinks were out of a bottle(gives you that full mexico feel) they have Delicious Agua Frescas, variety of flavors. I Can't wait to go back and try new things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Came here on my lunch and the service was fast and our server was very attentive. The burritos are huge!!!  The good was very flavorful and authentic. I will recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"This is a newer restaurant in our area. This is our first time of coming here, food was excellent, place was very clean, server was courteous and nice, always smiling, and prices are very reasonable. My wife and I had a steak and onion quesadilla. It was 16 inches long and was really good tasting. We also had a chicken tostada that was piled very high. We both really liked it. They bring you chips and sauce when you come in and sit down. Our bill for both items came to $13. It filled both of us up and we had to take some home.

The prices are along the lines of going to a Berto's type restaurant, but this place is much better. Their food is more along the lines of food you would find down in Mexico.

They homemake their items there. The 16 inch homemade tortilla was fantastic. We really enjoyed the salsa also that they home make.

Only con you need to know about is that they do not have soda machines. So if you would like a soda, you can buy it by the can for $.99 or they have bottled pop also. We had water and it tasted great, nothing wrong with that. It's nice and roomy inside and we were comfortable and enjoyed ourselves.

Consensus was between my wife and I, that we will go back again. It was very good."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Went there hoping to have a decent authentic Mexican meal. No vegetable (vegetarian friendly) dishes. Only meat dishes. I had to settle for a cheese quesadilla. It was a tiny one with a small bit of cheese. It came with a tiny bit of plain refrained beans and plain Spanish rice and all of it was lukewarm not even hot. None of it was fresh. Even the chips were average, stale & the salsa was super watery. The waitress was pleasant but when I mentioned the food wasn't good and hot she just apologized but didn't offer a way to make it right. My Dad ordered a chicken burrito which was large but came plain with no sides. But it must have been microwaved because the tortilla dried out right away and it seemed pre-made not homemade. Seems like a fast food place with tables. The TV was on, outside was a speaker blaring some music and it appears they have a good selection of sweet drinks. Anyway my meal wasn't even worth the cost. I could have made my own at home for less. All in all I doubt we will go back or recommend it."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here on a Wednesday, they have Menudo on special, I love menudo! In I went, staff was friendly, except for the male manager all he could is smile and not say any words of welcome or how is you food etc.  My Menudo was very flavorful, but I wish there had been some hominy as all I found in the whole bowl were three kernels of hominy, the rest was tripe, and the tripe was a little more chewy than I like, but like I said it tasted really good. The sodas are in a bottle and they had no beer. sigh! The food took awhile to be served which seemed like a long time because there is nothing to look at since the place is not decorated at all, even the floors are just plain like they look after you scrape up old tile or carpet, boring."}
{"text":"The food there is good my wife likes the tacos from there. I had a really bad experience with one of the employees over hot sauce, really? I ordered tacos to go and the sauce they give you is too spicy for my wife, so I asked if I could get a small amount of the salsa they use for the chips which is really mild so that my wife could put on her tacos.. and the girl refused just because. She couldn't even give me a good explanation to why. I have been there a lot of times and everyone else that I buy from always provides the salsa. So I just don't understand why she didn't want to give me some witch is kind of dumb and she was also rude and didn't even hand me my drinks which I had to go and get before I left out of their fridge.. Just thought I'd share my experience. Not sure if I will go back."}
{"text":"Everything tastes like homemade Mexico City Style food. The beef is high quality. The service is friendly and considerate. The Tlcoyo with beef and nopales was unique and very delicious for only $4.99 and definitely a full dinner size. The Nopales are tender and not waxy, just the way I like them. I am glad we found this unique place. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is where I go when I'm craving my new favorite quesadilla: pork brain. Before you make a gross-out face, give is a try. It's quite lovely.

At their 35th Avenue location, I've had the pork brain quesadilla as well as their namesake, the red chile machete. Both are filling and delish!"}
