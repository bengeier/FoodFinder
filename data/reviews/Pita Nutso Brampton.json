{"text":"Not sure why this place has only 2 stars. I ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich and it was delicious. Would definitely come again. 

I've been to many pita nutsos in the GTA and this one is my favourite."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars

I ordered the hummus plater which included beef. An enjoyable meal, but they could do better with more flavour overall. The hummus could've used more lemon and garlic, and the beef with more seasoning. I also wish they had another spicier hot sauce available. That said, it was still pretty good and quite fresh. I also like that they freshly grilled bell peppers and added it to it.

Nice interior, clean, and friendly service."}
{"text":"$4.25 for a tiny square box of plain rice. Are you kidding me? These guys are brutal. . Only place I've ever been to, in the history of restaurants, that charges less money for French fries than plain rice.  

Chicken shawarma wrap had the least amount of chicken I've ever received in a shawarma, and it was $7.99

Hope your extreme cheapness was worth the 1 star rating"}
{"text":"Now I know why theres no shawarma in their name. 
This place is not a shawarma joint. 
Just like any other shawarma point that's not owned by Arabic people this place too has their \"so called\" shawarma diced up and kept in a bowl just to be reheated and served tasting like crap. 
I understand doing that on lunch time when it's busy but at 7:45 pm when the place is not even busy there should be no excuse for that. 
Cook the  shawarma like a shawarma. On a spit."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious for being a chain restaurant. Not as many toppings if you get a shwarma plate like at other restaurants such as Shwarma Queen or Villa Madina. Price is on par for wraps and plates. 

If you ask for anything extra you usually have to pay whereas other places would just give it to you for free especially if you are a regular.

Taste is good but there are better offerings out there."}
{"text":"The food is awesome! I always order beef shawarma.
Small place. Not good for large group.Long lineup every lunch time but it's worth a wait.
This is my favorite Pita Nutso branch so far."}
{"text":"Have 2 for 16.95 deals advertised on their menu and directly on the cash screen but yet \"doesn't offer it anymore\" uh...but then why is it still up? It would help to keep customers if you clearly write somewhere at least saying that the deal is no longer available so that people don't waste their time standing in line asking for the deal. It's no excuse to simply blow me off without even any eye contact with me saying they didn't change the screen yet. Never coming back. Not because the deal is no longer available but because of lack of respect from them."}
