{"text":"Food is delicious, price is kinda high for breakfast place but the service is excellent & the ambiance gives an uplifting mood."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots the have pot of bread that you can get instead of toast get it ! So amazing it's like a cinnamon bun without the frosting soft melts in your mouth. My family enjoys the red velvet pancakes intense chocolate flavor almost don't even need syrup. The omelets are so fluffy and packed with flavor and the crispy hash browns will knock your socks off. I would recommend anyone to come here bring the family and a plus the service is wonderful Amanda I believe is her name pretty girl with green eyes very attentive our drinks where always full"}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday brunch and had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated, but it was well worth the wait. The French press coffee is AH-MAZING!  The chicken and waffles, Chilaquiles, and bacon wrapped filet with eggs were so good!  Service was great too. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  BUT, what happened to the pot of bread?!?  The last FOUR times I've been in they've been \"out\" of them.  If you keep running out of them over and over, wouldn't that be a sign to start ordering more?  The food is great, but for the price you pay, they should have it more together."}
{"text":"Came in with a party of 8, our waitress Kris was extremely friendly and very helpful with menu options. Food was great, and I highly recommend for big groups. Ask for Kris if she's available!"}
{"text":"Great place. One of my favorite breakfast places in Vegas! Extremely reasonable, great food, and great service"}
{"text":"Man i love coming here the staff are friendly and make it a priority to get to know you. The food is amazing and the prices are fair....."}
{"text":"Their service absolutely stinks.. Food is always brought out cold. The Biscuits that come with gravy were HARD as a rock. I didn't enjoy the breakfast because the entire time everyone else was eating and I was waiting for something that shouldn't of been hard and cold in the first place. Really not the best breakfast and its false advertising to say so. Two thumbs down..."}
{"text":"I had to give at least one star,,,  deserves a quarter of a star!

Apparently you can just seat yourself if you don't want to wait...  Service already is stressful.  Our service was extremely slow.....our server actually walked away in the middle of ordering and then came back.... WHO DOES THAT!???  Had to flag waitress down for more coffee and creamer.  Took forever - 30 minutes to get our food... Eggs, pancakes and waffles should not take that long!  After I received my waffle I realized it tasted just like bisquik... So did the pancakes.  Food was below average ... Service sucked!!! But the syrup was good. That's it... Good syrup! 

This restaurant's management needs to step up and manage... Total chaos..will not be back here!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Will be coming back before we leave Vegas. 
The iced mocha was yum! Waffle platter and French toast platter were also very yummy and filling! They give you fresh whip cream, sweet butter, and warm maple syrup that just melts in your mouth!! If you want to try something off the strip then check out this place. 

Our server Amber was very friendly, fast but not pushy, and she just made the experience that much better!"}
{"text":"Too good! I tryed the bacon wraped steak medalions the steak was top notch and I must admit so were the eggs and potatoes..the only bummer is that this place did not serve beer...I love steak eggs and beer!...MUST TRY THIS PLACE PPL..DO IT!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Location can be busy and staff seems overwhelmed at times. Not sure why they have to wear the pajamas..."}
{"text":"What a great find for breakfast!  All four of us enjoyed our choices of pancakes, waffles, salad and homemade cornbeef hash.  The only thing that topped the food was the excellent service from our waitress Lisa, kitchen and staff.    We'll be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem. My first time here. This place is great. I had the small 8oz ribeye steak eggs and hash browns. The steak was seasoned perfectly and the hash browns were great. Service was quick and this place was busy, constant traffic of people. I was 100% satisfied. 
I will return for breakfast here again and again. My only issue even though I gave them 5 stars is that they didn't have any of their signature \"pot o bread\" ,gives me a reason to come back. Enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"I'm so glad my boyfriend is a yelp junkie he found this hidden gem. We hate eating on the strip!! Amazing food!!"}
{"text":"This was an excellent brunch place. Good portions of hashbrowns, eggs, and ribeye steak. I asked for the eggs over medium and the ribeye steak medium rare and they came out perfectly. The biscuits were good and the coffee was refilled often."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for Mother's day brunch. We didnt have a reservation, but the wait wasn't too long(considering it was mothers day). The food was really good too. I had the ham steak and eggs with hash browns and my wife had the Texas French toast. Prices were reasonable and the staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I so want to love this place. The decor is whimsical and colorful, and the servers being in their pajamas is a fun touch, but after eating there twice, the food and the service just aren't worth the price. My first trip, about a month ago, I ordered the Ham-N-Eggs Benedict, and it was just OK. The entire dish was barely warm, the english muffin was barely toasted, the hash browns were really nothing special, and the overall dish was just mediocre. I took my friend there for her birthday today, and I was so disappointed in the food and the service that I probably won't be giving this place another chance. I figured that since they call themselves a \"steak and egg place,\" I should probably try their steak, so I ordered the Bacon Wrapped Tenderloin Steak. The description on the menu on their website says it comes with \"dijon brown butter onions atop a swiss cheese open-faced omelet & hash brown potatoes\" for $13.50.  The waitress asked me how I wanted my steak cooked, and I ordered \"medium.\" The dish had not one onion on it, so I politely asked the waitress if it came with brown butter onions, and she said no. I asked her to get the menu, we looked at it together, we could both see the word onions in the description, yet she pointed to the little yellow squiggle of sauce on the omelette and said, \"that is the dijon brown butter there on the omelette.\" She then asked me if I wanted a side of onions, and I said no, and I reiterated that the description said it came with onions, yet she flat out ignored that fact. I felt like I was in Bizzaro land. I wasn't rude in any way, I just wanted what the menu described, and she acted like we were reading two different things. Seeing that I took my friend there for her birthday, I was trying to be very nice and low keyed and not draw attention, so I moved on. Next comes the bacon wrapped tenderloins. They were cooked \"well done\" and dry, even though I ordered them \"medium.\"  The potatoes were the same as before, really nothing special. They're like thick flat potato shreds with not much tasty crust, so I consider them undercooked and just not my style. So I ate a couple of bites of everything, decided it needed help, so I put some ketchup on the potatoes, hot sauce on the omelette, and A1 on the steak, but nothing helped. It just was not a good breakfast, certainly not a $13.50 breakfast, so I stopped eating at about 1/3 of the way into it. Again, not wanting to draw attention, I figured perhaps the waitress might put two and two together, see that I didn't eat much of it, and ask for some feedback, or see if I wanted anything else, but no such luck. The best thing about this place is the decor and the hope of having a delicious breakfast, but alas, 'tis not enough for me to give them yet another chance."}
{"text":"When someone doesn't care how far they have to drive to eat your food, you know you have a FAN! This place Rocks! From the moment you step in the door, it looks cool, it smells awesome, the staff is wonderful and the food.. OMG. Rise & Shine Chilaquiles and the Steak and Eggs Benedict are about as IT as IT's gonna get! As far as a breakfast/lunch spot goes, they just nailed it! I can't possibly imagine how it can get any better! (Unless of course, they build one in Summerlin.)"}
{"text":"A little overpriced but the food is definitely good. I had the hams teak and eggs with hash browns. Nothing left on the plate but the gam bone."}
{"text":"This is a great place, I've been there many times. The Crunchy Cinnamon Raisin French Toast is my favorite."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could! Horrible service! Food came out in 5 minutes or less???! Eggs Benedict was raw and smothered in hollandaise (soogy and uneatable) My Granddaughter's eggs and pancakes which where served on top of each other?! had a long black hair under her food...GROSSSS!!! Will never go back"}
{"text":"The 25 minute wait was so worth it! The food was amazing and we will make stopping here on our way out of Vegas a tradition;)"}
{"text":"Cute breakfast spot.  The food quality and taste here is excellent.  The chicken and waffle is awesome, fried chicken - juicy on the inside and perfectly crispy outside.  Can't go wrong with anything here.  The potted bread is so also a must, so yummy.  Wish they have a place like this in LA.  Definitely a must stop when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great costumer service!. The servers looked cute on their pajamas hehe. The food is great! I had the chilaquiles with steak and it was delicious!!!. OJ is fresh squeezed. I also try the cinnamon French toast, which had real pieces of cinnamon french toast!. Overall this place has really good breakfast. I would definitely stop by again. Until next time!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast spot been coming here atleast 2x a month i can honestly say the best PANCAKES in las vegas  !"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but after 3 times I'm done. There is no sense of urgency at all as far as being seated or getting your food. They would rather have you wait 15 min while they wipe down every dirty table instead of have a busser to clean up the mess. Because of the nonchalant service and the fact that they just don't seem to care my family won't ever be back"}
{"text":"Just in Vegas for vacation and found the place on Yelp and was pleased with the food and service. I would definitely recommend and come back."}
{"text":"Perfect friendly service, ideal breakfast spot with easy parking and an oasis for the steak and eggs crowd. Worth visiting to get away from the strip and casino crowd. Great coffee. Work of art ceiling. Five stars at this price point. Oh, get at least one buscuit to share."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite restaurant in all of Nevada. If you want sweet, get their cinnamon French toast. If you want savory, get their crispy fried chicken wrap. You won't regret it! My mouth is watering just thinking of this place."}
{"text":"Food was good.  We shared the chicken and waffles with a side of the sausages.  The pot of bread is like a soft cinnamon roll and is tasty. 

Our server was a bit slow and the server at the table next to us started taking care of us.  

There seemed to be a lot of screaming children and crying babies.  So if you are trying to socialize your children it may be a good place to hang out as the food is quite good and I mostly just knocked it down for our server and the noise."}
{"text":"We love to go to the Rise and Shine on Southern Highlands Pkwy. The restaurant has delicious food and great coffee and juices. The price is not super inexpensive but not too pricey either. There is coffee cake that comes in a little cup and it's really cute and very yummy. The restaurant has a nice, laid back atmosphere as well!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite place to go for breakfast. Everything is flawless. From the adorable bright, comfy, clean decor to the friendly staff and you guessed it amazing food! 

I am an eggs benedict fan - and they most certainly take the cake with their selections of eggs benedict and NY steak. 

I have dined at Rise and Shine about 3 times, usually after the morning rush and was always pleased with the service. 

Did I mention the fresh homemade lemonade!? GO!"}
{"text":"waitresses in pj's, attentive management, and damn fine food.  the only thing disappointing about rise and shine is that it's not closer to where i live.  the perfect solution to a hangover morning or a lazy sunday."}
{"text":"What can I say great breakfast. Good lunch options.  Large portions and good coffee.
Don't skip the pot o bread it is yummy.  Steak chiliquilles (sp?) Is very good. Breakfast burritos are large and tasty.

Why only four stars you ask.  
Well the salsa looks feels and tastes like pace brand salsa
The chicken fried steak.  Well this is hard for me because I am from Texas and have grown accustomed to good chicken fried steak.  The one served here looks like a chicken fried steak. The cream gravy is good but every time I've had it here they didn't trim the fat.  Nothing worse than cutting a piece off and the first bite bieng oddly chewie.
All in all if you live nearby you must try the rise and shine.  Just stay aeay from the chicken fried steak.... unless you just don't know any better."}
{"text":"Great food, a little pricey for breakfast but the food is truly amazing. Have had everything from chicken & waffles to simple eggs over easy with a pancake. Let me tell you their waffles are to die for, and they bring you warm syrup with cinnamon sticks in it. YUMMY!!! Plus they have French pressed coffee. If you want to treat yourself to an amazing meal for breakfast and don't mind a little higher price tag- go here! Also be prepared for a wait when you head here in the morning, they are usually packed."}
{"text":"I had the same experience as someone who posted here 7 days ago.  Asked for eggs a certain way and was told \"no\" especially since it was a Sunday.  Got me thinking is this not cooked to order restaurant?  We didn't wait to find out."}
{"text":"Wow this place was perfect for my family. The food was great. The pot of bread was so good. The service was top notch. Lisa our waitress was probably the best waitress I've ever had."}
{"text":"Good food, fun atmosphere. The servers wear pajamas. And people are constantly checking to make sure everything is OK. If it were cheaper, I'd be there all the time. But I don't suppose quality is cheap. You've got to try the 'pot of bread'. Just sayin'."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in the staff greets you and is very friendly, I LOVE that the servers wear Pj's for their uniforms, it makes you feel comfortable and welcome!
I ordered a Ham & Cheese omelet, very yummy and a very large portion!"}
{"text":"Service has gone down hill I used to love going there but now they suck they there popularity has gone to there head. Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  The service was top notch and the food was great!  Loved the pot bread among everything else we tried.  We loved this place so much that we had to repeat!"}
{"text":"Horrible service by the hostess my party as well as another just stormed out. There was a large party of 7 in front of us and it took a while to get that set up which is fine. The problem came after that when all the parties that waited for the 7top to be seated were completely ignored so the hostess could go bag up a to go order who just walked in. We brought it to her attention (there are empty tables and people waiting to be seated for a very long time maybe you could sit us then help the to go order) her respinse was ummmmm yeah uhhhh. We wont be back"}
{"text":"Consistently good food and friendly service.  Slightly pricey for your average breakfast, but we keep going back because it's good, and close by."}
{"text":"I spend a week each summer in Las Vegas.  This year, I googled \"best breakfast in Las Vegas\" and discovered this gem which was only about two miles from my hotel (South Point Resort and Casino).  All the superlatives you've read in the other reviews are absolutely on the spot true.  The décor is cheerful, the service is absolutely wonderful, and the food is very, very good.  I agree with Google that this is one of the best breakfast (and lunch) places in Las Vegas.  Twice I had the rib eye steak and eggs plus the \"pot of bread\".  Once I tried the chicken fried steak and eggs.  Both were great but I liked the rib eye even better.  I always order my steak medium rare and I was pleasantly surprised to find it was perfectly cooked to my liking.  

Playing on the name of the restaurant, all the waitresses wear (modest) pajamas and each one is cheerful, knowledgeable, and attentive to your morning repast needs.  My friend and I ate here three mornings in a row and each time we were seated in Callie's section.  Waitress Callie is a sweet young darling who knows how to keep all her customers content.  Each time I visit Las Vegas, I will make a point to start my day at Rise & Shine - A steak & egg place."}
{"text":"Happened along this restaurant and was pleasantly surprised. The food was excellent,  service was awesome, location ehh a little far from home but its all worth it in the end.. we had the bacon wrappped steak and the ham steak both were cooked perfectly.. the little pot of bread was cool and a great twist on a cinnamon roll.. this place is great can't wait to visit again and try more items from the menu.."}
{"text":"First time visit and the food was great!!biscuits and gravy were so great! Hostess Jessica made sure everything was wonderful. She is very customer oriented. The waitress Cari was energetic & fun!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday around 930 ish had like a 10 mins wait for a table...had good service ...the food was good but a pricey ..57 bucks for a 3 person breakfast"}
{"text":"I live right off of Valle Verde, so on my morning drive to get Starbucks, I noticed that this place had opened up. I decided to take the time out to stop in since I'm always on the lookout for good places close by. 

As I walked in I immediately noticed the decor, which is very bright and colorful, with pretty patterned umbrellas hanging from the ceiling, which I found to be a nice atmosphere to start my day in.

The two women at the front counter greeted me warmly and sat me immediately, and told me my server would be Maria. 

Maria asked if I'd been there before, then explained the menu to me when I said I had not. I decided to go with a ham steak breakfast with a pot of French press and some OJ.

Maria brought me my cup of bread, which comes with the breakfast and is apparently a specialty of theirs. I was a bit skeptical as to whether it would be any good, but it was basically like an extremely fluffy cinnamon roll inside of a cup, with the sauce/icing on the side, and I enjoyed it a lot. 

When the ham steak came out I was also surprised, as I was expecting a normal sized, 6-8 inch around, half an inch thick steak. The steak they brought out was at least an inch thick, and probably a foot or so around, a good pound or more of meat. I wasn't sure if I'd even be able to finish it, but it was so juicy, tender, and smoky that I managed to eventually, although I sat there for a good hour or so. 

The eggs and hashbrowns were a bit above average, tasty with a kick of seasoning that isn't usually included, and added some extra interest to the dish. 

The French press is touted as Lavazza, which I've had before at other restaurants. Although as a coffee snob I'll say it isn't the best cup of coffee I've ever had, it is better than the coffee at 90% of other restaurants in Las Vegas, and having a good cup of French press to go with the steak made it much easier to digest. 

The OJ tasted fresh squeezed and had a slice of orange as a garnish, which I was happy about as concentrate at restaurants bothers me. 

The entire time I was there Maria was very attentive to me, always making sure my water was full, if I needed anything else, asking if I liked everything, and joking about being proud of me being able to finish the ham steak. 

As I left I asked for the manager, Gilberto, who I met just so I could tell him that Maria and the front and back end staff were all great. He was very polite to me, asked me what I had, introduced himself, and made me feel like a valued customer.

All in all this seems like it will be my new favorite local breakfast place, and I'm glad they opened up right across the street. The one qualm I have is they need beds in the back, because after you finish one of their steaks you really feel like rolling back into bed and not getting out till after 12 or 1."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the staff is friendly. My wife and I  enjoy eating here. However, I have two issues eating here. The first is that they do not have pancakes as a side.  I could never eat just pancakes for breakfast. I normally like to get two pancakes to eat with my breakfast,  but that is not offered here. I did, however, find out from our server that you can substitute toast for a pancake. Note that this information is not on the menu. A compromise I suppose,  but I like my eggs runny, and everyone knows that requires toast. The only other option is to order 4 or 5 pancakes. 

But the biggest issue is that many employees touch the areas of dishes and silverware that you put in your mouth. For instance I've seen an employee prepare silverware settings by touching the knives on the blade part,  with bare hands. I've seen many,  many instances of a server ring up an order on the wall mounted IPad and then bring your drink to the table by holding the glass at the top where your lips go.  I have also seen servers grab toast out of the toaster and put it on the plate with bare hands. This is all done without hand washing. I would like the staff to be more aware of where their hands have been before they touch my silverware or glass and more aware of where to touch the dishes."}
{"text":"We just love this place. For us it's a neighborhood gem-a short walk from home. The consistently friendly and good service, the great food and colorful relaxed decor make this well worth a drive to get here. I've enjoyed every breakfast I've had. But only go for the chicken and waffles if you're seriously hungry. Kids and Senior options too -which is nice."}
{"text":"I was sooo impressed with this place. I hate that it closes so early but I will make sure I get to go there at least once while I am in town. Everyone got something different at the table and everything was great! Can't wait to go back and get a biscuit"}
{"text":"Was passing through town, looked this place up on yelp. Much better than one of the buffets on the strip. A little out of the way in a drip mall set in a sleeping area , but work it. Service was good as was the food, will definitely stop again if given the chance"}
{"text":"Sadly what was once one of my favorite spots for breakfast and lunch has declined in service and food quality to the point where I'm unlikely to return. Since their expansion I have been in 3 times and each time the service was slow, our servers seemed distracted and sometimes downright rude in pushing us to order something from the new juice bar. The food portions have been reduced and the quality of ingredients seems to have declined as well. My last visit was not at a particularly busy time but multiple tables were left uncleared and dirty. All in all the charm of this place has gone and it's a shame because this was once a true gem of the southwest valley."}
{"text":"Outstanding omelet, hash browns, coffee and service.  One of the best breakfasts I have had."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for breakfast after looking on Yelp for a breakfast place away from the strip.  What a pleasant surprise!!
Great variety on the menu.  I had an omelet but the Red Velvet pancakes looked interesting.  But I did try the pot of bread.  Imagine a cinnamon roll baked in a small flower pot.  It was delicious and very unique.
Service was great.  Got seated immediately and servers were quick to refill coffee and water.  It was excellent.  
Best part, the servers were wearing pajamas!!!"}
{"text":"First time at rise and shine, first review I've bothered to write for a restaurant.  Had the chicken fried steak and it was delicious.  Will be back again, I only fear writing this review will make it slightly more crowded"}
{"text":"Ate there 4 times with only one good experience.  We ordered eggs benedict on a visit and the eggs were runny and gross.  The waitress agreed.  The Chef at that place reminds me of the Soup Nazi guy on Seinfeld.  He began to argue out loud where customers could hear with the waitress about our order. She handled it very professionally and told him that she is not there to argue with him.  This does not serve the restaurant well and made us feel that the food he prepares is his way or tough shit.  Today, we went there to give them another chance.  We ordered a Cobb Salad.  The Salad came back with FRIED chicken strips on it and should have been grilled chicken strips.  We thought, here we go again.  The Cobb salad comes back and now there are diced pieces of chicken on it (not strips as before) and much less.  We questioned why the salad did not have hard boiled egg and blue chees crumbles on it as is stated in plain english on the menu that the restaurant hands out to customers to order from.  I showed it to the waitress and she said we were right. At that point, we had been there about 1/2 hour and decided we had to leave to get back to work on time.  The waitress then takes the salad back to the Chef and the Chef says IT IS A COBB SALAD.  I told the waitress that perhaps the Chef SHOULD READ THE MENU that customers order their food from before he prepares meals.  I gave this restaurant the benefit of the doubt and hoped the next time we went there to eat they would get it right.  Well, no such luck, this place sucks due to the Chef's attitude.  I will never go there again because of it.  I recommend that if you go there, read the menu and see if they get your order right and that you receive what you paid for.  They can't seem to for us.  A complete waste of tiime which should otherwise be a nice and enjoyable experience.  Note to Management:  GET ANOTHER CHEF.  Your currfent chef is not doing you any favors. In Fact it is because of him, we will not recommend your restaurant to others.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"We come to rise and shine every Sunday most servers know us by name. After today I don't think we will be back. The server forgot to put the order in for one of the people in my party. We got lousy sorry from the waitress no manager approached our table and no one even offered to take it off the check we had to tell the cashier to take it off cause we never relieved it. Not the way to treat loyal customers we had to go to Ikea so my husband could get something to eat 

Update: 
We returned to our usual schedule and had breakfast this morning.  The welcome when we first walked in was enough for us to know they made a mistake last time and they were glad we have them a second chance.  We love Annalisa the manager and our server Sara as well.   They made us feel welcome again and gave impeccable service.  Food was amazing.  Thank you for having us back again.  We will be back next Sunday."}
{"text":"Best steak and eggs ever! It's fairly busy on a Sunday but they generally do a great job with getting you in. You will leave this place feeling more than satisfied. Seriously, best breakfast EVER!!!"}
{"text":"Yelp pays off again!!!! A 15-20 minute wait is nothing on a Sat afternoon! Well worth it, delicious coffee, the pot of bread to die for and fab service!!! I had the eggs Benedict, one of the best I've ever had!! My husband had the rib eye (have to try the steak when it's in the title). It did not disappoint! Love the Sunflower decor and the waitresses in pjs!!! Service is 5 star and fast!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Not a fast-paced dining experience, so plan on a hour. Highly recommend the French press coffee!"}
{"text":"Very good food and fast! Kids menu is very good sized for a 7 year old and 2 year old to share (they both don't eat a lot). Very polite staff. Would definitely recommend it if ur looking for a quick service breakfast. Can't wait to come back to try their tomato soup with grilled cheese for lunch."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for a nice sit-down breakfast, and the experience was so pleasant! When you walk in, the ceiling is covered in upside-down spinning umbrellas, immediately creating a light and whimsical atmosphere.

The service was excellent! Our servers were attentive, quick, very happy, and everyone was dressed in pajamas -- if the staff dressed in pajamas isn't awesome, I don't know what is.

I went simple and had some oatmeal with pecans, brown sugar, milk, and raisins; the portions here are HUGE! I swear there was about 3 servings of oatmeal in my dish. My fam had the chicken and waffles, red velvet pancakes, and benedict, which they all enjoyed.

Even after my family stayed a little longer talking at the table after having paid, they still brought us fresh coffee every couple minutes. Major thumbs up to Rise & Shine!"}
{"text":"Food was very good but kind of pricy for a small strip mall restaurant. Portions were big, service was excellent and the place was very clean. I would highly recommend but warn about the $$$."}
{"text":"Just got done eating breakfast here with my boyfriend and must I say we are so obsessed with this place and will definitely be coming here for breakfast every time we visit Las Vegas. Our server was Ashley, whom was so friendly and accommodating. We ordered the ny steak with spinach eggs Benedict, and the buffalo chicken breast w/ eggs. And you must try their fresh juices!! It was so good I had to take one to go."}
{"text":"I have been to this breakfast place when I am in the area and I have enjoyed every visit. Sometimes, it can take a minute to get seated because I have seen the host also bus tables. Other than that, the food and service have been great. The first time I got the Cinnamon Toast Crunch French Toast with real maple syrup. It was delicous. The second time I got the Chicken Fried Steak. Now, they are known for their steak and eggs so I would stick with that. My sister got the omelette which just seemed like any average omelette. My mother got the waffle which was soft and tasty.But the Chicken Fried Steak was THE BEST and the gravy was amazing. I was in heaven.They also serve illy and French Press coffee. I loved the French Press myself. If you're in the mood for steak and eggs, I would come here. :)"}
{"text":"I wanted some breakfast but woke up late today, and I had bookmarked Rise and Shine in my Yelp. Bruh! This is an excellent breakfast spot. The portions, The pot of bread , the staff was very nice. served till 3:00pm...I don't always do breakfast but when I do I prefer Rise & Shine first time in here but it won't be my last."}
{"text":"I never leave reviews on Yelp.... But this place was AMAZING!!! From the moment we walked in the door there were two very nice ladies who greeted us and didn't waste any time to seat us!! My breakfast was everything I hoped for. Your classic American egg cheese ham bacon and sausage bagel with a side of hash browns! My boyfriend went big and got the country fried steak and I had to steal a bite! This place seriously so good. And our server was amazing! I wish I remembered her name. She made a joke that I couldn't take my leftovers home and that I was held hostage till I finished everything on my plate. I honestly believed her hahahah great food and great morning spent here!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Ate here this morning! I can't believe some of the negative reviews! The food was delish, the French press coffee was so good! I was super happy that my oatmeal came out with pecans & raisins & brown sugar! The bacon was delish..... Our server was a sweetheart & I loved that they wore jammies!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd check out the \"New Place\" in our neighborhood. Always anxious to find a good Breakfast Place especially one so close. Being close was the only Good thing about Rise & Shine, Valle Verde Location.  I realize flavor is a personal thing, so I shouldn't complain about how things tasted. I had ordered the Two Eggs, over medium, Hash browns, Sausage, and the 'Cup of Bread'. The two eggs were perfect. The Hash Browns were more than the normal hash browns. They had \"spruced\" them up with spices and the texture felt like they were \"Freeze Dried-'just add water' and heat\". There wasn't any \"skillet type\"  items on the menu so I created my own. I also asked for a side of Gravy, noticing they had 'Biscuits & Gravy' was on the menu. The 'Banger\" sausage had a good flavor, but it is not a breakfast sausage, in my opinion. The Gravy was flavorless, except for the black pepper. The 'Cup of Bread\" was too doughy and the \"dipping sauce\" wasn't very tasty.  I usually eat less than half of my meal, taking leftovers home for a future meal or snack. So, I realize that the waitress may have thought I wasn't quite done, but it took her a very long time to see if I was done, and if there'd be anything else.  She  dropped off the bill and said \"I can take that up for you, but take your time\". Placing my credit card on the bill, I feel, indicates I'm ready to pay. I waited at least 15 more minutes, with different wait staff passing me by  numerous times. I was NEVER asked if I needed a \"BOX to GO\" and if there may be something I didn't like about the meal, due to the amount I hadn't finished. Like I said previously, taste is a personal thing,and I wasn't going to take this breakfast home for later. So, I just got up and went to the front reception desk, and paid my bill. One good thing I noticed was that the Wait Staff was dressed in Pajamas. I thought that was very clever. But, I won't be going back, just to see the pajamas."}
{"text":"just had the rib eye steak and chilaquiles....it was a religious experience!!!!! I will be back every weekend!!!"}
{"text":"Rise & Shine is one of my staple breakfast places, if I had to guess how many times I've been here I'd say 50+. Unfortunately, I have recently had to start eating gluten free and when I went to Rise & Shine yesterday I was super disappointed to learn that the chips they use in the chilaquiles are not gluten free! This would be a very easy fix for them. And as they do not have anything else gluten free friendly if you want a \"bread product\" with your meal it would expand their menu a bit. Also, the beans they use are not vegetarian (they have lard in them) another easy fix but not something I would complain about alone, I could just leave them off, but since I can't even eat the chips.... 

I will update my rating if they ever decide to update their menu with chips that are gluten free!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. All the servers are friendly and so accommodating. I have a hard time deciding between breakfast and lunch items, everything is just so good. I'm a regular and the food is always perfect. Great with kids too!"}
{"text":"Attendant is very unfriendly.  Her demeanor and attitude she showed when we walked in made us walked out and choose another place to eat."}
{"text":"This place was good not bad but not great I will still go to one of my favorite spots for breakfast on my days off which is MIMI'S. I live in Southern Highlands and I was hoping this place was going to be my spot when I don't feel like going to MIMI'S, but no I'll go to Rise in Shine if I don't want to drive far.When I got there it was busy and we had to wait about 45 mins. It was a Sunday so it was expected didn't mind... we waited outside because there is no place to wait inside, what I think they need to do is get some chairs outside or put a bench so people can sit while they wait. When they called us to be seated the hostess was very friendly and so was the server. But what I didn't like is that when I ordered my glass of orange juice it SUCKED and that's what the customers are looking for,especially if your eating breakfast!!!! The orange sucked because it was diluted with water to save money. It tasted just like water and the color was not even orange it looked yellow. From the moment I saw it when the server brought it to us I knew something was up. I wasn't the only person who notice that it was others too. Then what I ordered to eat was chilaquillas, I was expecting the traditional way but I was wrong, the server explained to me what it was and she explained what I thought it was going to be the traditional way. But NO it was more tortilla chip than anything else very little sauce, very very little eggs, and two slice of avocado, overal it sucked. If you never had the original chilaquillas before u wouldn't know the difference then I guess.... But I think the owner should not call it chilaquillas and call it Chips and Egg; and yes I said egg because it was only one egg.So overall to conclude my review it was OK I had better before. I hope they read this and hopefully change what I wrote just so I and others can go there for breakfast!"}
{"text":"We live about 4 blocks from this restaurant. Over the last 3 months this place has fallen a part! We waited about 25 min to be seated, the fat boy seating people appeared to be more interested in making sure his friends sat down before the customers.

We are huge small business supporters but in this case we spoke to the ladies at the register, expressed our frustration and walked out.  The attitude at this place really sucks! We weren't even acknowledged , no apology, no can we fix it for you.  The only thing they had was a dumb look on their face.

To the business owner: your poor trained, unprofessional  staff is driving out your local client! You will need to hire a professional to manage the staff.  While at the restaurant about 6 tables where dirty with dishes and about 3 parties waiting for a table! Finally people started leaving. We did the same and went to the M casino hash house a go go. This restaurant is now our replacement."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant on a couple of occasions and it's never disappointed me. It has a neat decor and the staff all wear their pajamas. 

I ordered the Country Fried Steak and eggs and it's amazing! The steak is cooked perfectly and has a great tasty crunch. I got the hashbrowns on the side along with the \"pot of bread\". The hashbrowns were good, but nothing too special. The pot of bread was awesome though! It was incredibly fluffy with cinnamon baked in. They put some butter on top and it's perfect!

This is the best breakfast place I've been to in Las Vegas and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"A great breakfast place with friendly service and well trained cooks.  Omelets are fantastic, and they have nice touches like a mound of cinnamon bread served in a tiny planters pot (pot of bread).  I had a spinach, bacon, and cheese omelet which was delicious.  Very well prepared and the portion was a good size.  The hash browns are well prepared and tasty.  Menu is a little on the  small side, and $2.50 for a cup of coffee is a little steep.  Expect to pay $17-$20 per person for breakfast which is a little steep.  I tried the banger sausage and found it just okay - the bacon was better.  Seems to be a hickory bacon that's well seasoned.

I can't give it 5 stars because of the price.  A limited menu is okay for me.  It's impossible to make 200 things very well, so focusing on making 20-30 things increases the quality.  Definitely worth a trip to check it out, but for my family and I, the total bill was $62.  This is a little pricey for 3 adults and a child."}
{"text":"This place has jacked their prices up to where they are now just as expensive as the Peppermill. Unfortunately they don't even come close to the Peppermill in any area, from the quality of the food to the waitstaff to the overall ambiance. I hate driving to the strip but I hate being charged tourist prices when I'm off-strip even more. Bye-bye, little overpriced breakfast joint."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin. The decor is whimsical and fresh. The staff is friendly and there uniform is pajamas- freaking brilliant. The menu is reasonably priced, and the food is incredible. I had the chicken and waffles, season perfectly and very filling. It also came with the bread in a pot I thoroughly enjoyed. This dish also reheated well when I decided to finish it for a late lunch. My friend had the blueberry peanut butter pancakes, also delicious. I will be revisiting, just haven't decided if it will be every weekend or make a once a month thing so I don't over indulge."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots in Vegas! Love the chilaquiles and the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Absolutely amazing food and service! Always a good experience and a great time for my family and I to come have a delicious meal together. Place is deforested sooo cute also, looks like they put a lot of time and effort in to making it the way it is! Keep it up rise and shine!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service, and great uniforms (they go to work in their pj's)!"}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times. Today I wanted a simple tomato or vegetable juice. 

They don't have it!!! Sure they have a fancy juice bar to make gross concoctions loaded with sugary, sweet stuff but not just regular juices.

Oh and those juice bar drinks are expensive to top it off. One expects a certain minimum basics when a breakfast location..."}
{"text":"I found this wonderful spot using yelp. The high stars are not deceiving.  The place is not to big and not to small. It's conducive to large groups as well as like myself a party of 1. They have bar seating if your a party of 1 or 2 and dont want wait for a both or table. The waitress staff works really hard and fast to make sure your experience is a good one. Ask to be seated in vanessa's area. She is, fun, attentive and empathetic to your dining experience.  She gives you options along with your order that might not be on the menu or something you just didnt think of.  I ordered the ultimate steak breakfast.  It came with an 8 oz. Steak, 2 or 3 scrambled eggs, hashbrowns and your choice of bread. One of the bread options is called a pot of bread.  The title is deceiving because it comes in a little cup. But if you like a warm ooey gooey cinnamon roll, then you'll love this. I like to judge a breakfast establishment also by their hash browns.  this place to me has great fresh hash browns.  The steak was medium and was tasty. Not too much pink and still pleasantly juicy. You will not be disappointed.  I ate every bite. -- jeryl, aka Randy"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend just got back from Las Vegas this past weekend and tried new food spots we never did. We decided to try the Rise and Shine place that was near my friends house that lives in LV. Wait time was only 10 mins or less for us and our waitress was very helpful (which everyone seems like there). My girlfriend got the corned beef and hash (around $10), and she loved it because of its authenticity of real corned beef. I got the steak and eggs ($12) because I figured that is what they're known for. I got the medium rare steak and it was so juicy that I did not need steak sauce, only tobasco. Great portions for its price. Only downfall is that there are other steak and eggs spots in LV that are only $3.99. But I guess this is quantity and quality in the same time from my opinion."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Once you have delicious rib-eye instead of a crappy sirloin or eggs with herbs instead of just cooked in oil or a crispy chicken cutlet with real buffalo sauce (which tastes delicious with all kinds of things on the plate), it'll be hard to be happy with the typical Valley breakfasts."}
{"text":"Simply amazing food, me and my gf are vacationing good is outstanding. And everyone is like they said In pajamas!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't mean to make a stink, but I did a take out order today as I was doing a smiths run. I ordered chicken and waffles to go and got home and had raw chicken and waffles. I just threw the plate away as I am super paranoid."}
{"text":"Ok so I should have waited to give a review until after we had finished eating. Our server was not very attentive at all, we had to flag her down to ask for refills, the food was just ok but they do give hefty portions. The decor of the place was pretty cool but we  will not be returning here as the overall dining experience was just ok."}
{"text":"We stop by every once in awhile when craving country fried steak. The food is good but in my opinion pricey. The staff is always very nice, my kids love that they wear pajamas. Of course we always get the flower pot bread, great flavor and reminds me of the home style restaurants from the south. 

The place is usually super busy so be prepared to wait for awhile to be seated."}
{"text":"This place does breakfast right. Food is great, portions plenty, salads amazing. The staff takes pride in their workmanship (from the kitchen all the way to the hostess position) and they're friendly to boot! Awesome family breakfast place and I can even wear my jammies if I want to (the servers do every day).
Ryley and Colleen always take good care of us. We bring our dog with us too and they set up a nice table for us outside in the shade complete with a doggy water bowl. They're always willing and seem to be happy to accommodate. Rise and Shine rocks!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time for Valentines day breakfast at 10am and as expected had to wait 35 minutes for a table, but they had enough chairs outside to accommodate the waiting. I ordered the Belgian waffle which was nothing special, but they made the best overhard eggs I've ever had and the thick, crispy bacon was amazing. My husband got the best omelet he has ever had, with a side of hashed browns that we ended up sharing and I wish I could have more of! The ambiance is cute and we will definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"It was fairly good came with the family only problem the pancakes were half cooked but they kindly took them and brought us new ones"}
{"text":"I wasnt impressed. Service was slow...like slooooooooow. I ask for medium steak it came out well done my hashbrowns were just soggy potatoes on my plate . Thw omelette was great ill give them that and the french pressed coffee was amazing also but I might not go back."}
{"text":"Cute cute place. Servers in PJ's, flowers on the ceiling. Amazing food and service to match. I had a made-to-order bagel sandwich, but we also ordered omelets and kids meals. Everything was outstanding. To top it off, service was prompt, friendly, and helpful. We will absolutely go here again.  

Recap: great ambience, food, and service. A short car ride from the strip that is well worth it."}
{"text":"Get there early to avoid the crowd. My favorite meals are the Steak Chilaquiles and the Chocolate Velvet Pancakes. The pot of bread with cream cheese sauce is a must."}
{"text":"I love breakfast restaurants. This place definitely shot atop of my list of best breakfasts. I had the chilaquiles with a steak. I'm used to traditional homemade chilaquiles but what I got was a little different. Once I started eating I couldn't stop. I didn't leave a morsel. Very, very good!!"}
{"text":"I will say we went here for Brunch on Valentines Day. This place is AWEFUL! The food is so salty like it was soaked in the Dead Sea before they served it to us! The crispy chicken sand which was so over done to the point there was no longer any chicken in it anymore. The server brought it out any way and piled all the fixens on top in hopes I wouldn't notice. I sent it back and ordered the grilled chicken sand which instead. There was a salty sliver of chicken smothered in cheese and once again all the fixens were piled on top. The French fries weren't fries as we know them they were smothered in salt basil and lime. Yuck! It took over a half hour for my new meal to get to the table and it wasn't even busy! The owner had sat exactly two other tables since we had arrived. When the server came over to tell me my order was on it's way a half hour later I just asked for a box. She seemed shocked. I made them take my order off the total of the bill. The other people with me seemed to like their food but they all had breakfast items. All in all I will not suggest this place to anyone nor will I ever go back! Oh and I would have felt guilty feeding this to my dogs (as it would probably kill them being so salty) so I put it in the trash where belongs. YUCK!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Rise and Shine off and on since it opened and it continues to disappoint. Merely by virtue of being the only non-bar breakfast place in the area it lasts despite mediocre food and terrible service. I have yet to eat a meal there that was not lukewarm and the victim of bad execution."}
{"text":"This is a simple review: best place for breakfast period! But you have to ask for Amber...truly the best server here...you have to have the best service with the best food...just makes sense"}
{"text":"this is my favorite place to eat breakfast,the service is exellent, the food is fresh and juicy and perfectly cooked. I recommend that they will not repent of this wonderful place.
the pancakes and waffles are the best i have ever eaten, the menu of the lunch time it is very healthy, don't forget this place to share with your family a good breakfast and a good lunch."}
{"text":"I have been going there for 4 yrs and its been real good.  This past year it has gone down hill.  The waitresses have all left and the new ones are rude and unfriendly.  It takes forever for our food to arrive at our table after its been sitting on the counter waiting to be delivered.  The food is drowning in butter and the bacon is swimming in grease.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place! I'm fussy about the way my eggs are cooked and they get it right all the time. I'm not a fan of hash browns but I manage to eat it all up here which tells you that it's really good. My favorite has to be the pot of bread. I'm never disappointed at Rise and Shine and the service is excellent!!! The friendly servers are dressed in comfy p.j.s I highly recommend this great breakfast restaurant for family dining."}
{"text":"A great place to eat breakfast, and an even better place for great service. The food is phenomenal. It does not matter what you get to eat, it is all delicious. The service is even better. Everyone is friendly, and they are always willing to go the extra mile to make the customer happy!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Every time we visit Vegas and stay off the strip, we have to eat here. Chilequiles are very good, and the chorizo burritos are good/filling. The portions are large though prices have gone up more than 15% this year."}
{"text":"This was the second time I have been to this place and again was not disappointed. The two fisted turkey bagel sandwich is one of the best I have had. Includes eggs, bacon, cheese and avocado. Pretty delicious. Top it off with a side of cheesy hash browns and French press coffee and you're good to go. Service was a bit slow but definitely a four star experience overall."}
{"text":"Not one complaint here! Will come back again when we come back to Vegas! Everything was delicious! Group of 4 ordered Chilaquiles, French Toast, Belgium waffle, biscuits and gravy and patty melt everything was the bomb.com."}
{"text":"Lisa is one of the best servers I have ever had. Not only was she responsive to our needs but she has a little flare to her wording and her kindness! She should be praised for her above and beyond efforts. The pot of bread is a must!!"}
{"text":"Hard night at the bar? Looking for a real breakfast that has not been sitting under a heat lamp? Well Rise and Shine is the perfect place, awesome service, french press, and great chicken fried steak, need I say more? But have taken bites of the french toast from my wife plate and it delicious as well. A must for those like myself that enjoy a great breakfast"}
{"text":"I found my new favorite breakfast place! I started with the yogurt parfait w/ honey, granola and bananas, loved it. I had a hard time deciding what to order because everything sounded amazing but after consulting with our server she suggested the eggs benedict and I was not disappointed. My boyfriend ordered the steak omelet and I made him get the pot of bread, so good!

Great food and service, check it out"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor. Friendly and efficient staff wearing pjs. Great food, fresh juices, and espresso!  This is as if someone took my wish list and created a business! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food; terrific service and reasonable price. Love it!"}
{"text":"Small little spot in Southern Highlands. Great location for breakfast but I recently ordered food for carry out and was a little disappointed. Definitely didn't meet up to the taste and flavor of eating at the location. Still my breakfast spot just not for carr"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to have a hearty breakfast.  Best diner coffee I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Food is great! Customer service every time I come is okay. Not the friendliest. But I got APOLLO this time and he is AWESOME. I will defenitly be requesting him as my  main server from now on. You rock!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing breakfast. Wonderful server, super cute atmosphere! Try the pot bread, red velvet pancakes, chicken fried steak, the ultimate and eggs Benedict. We loved everything!"}
{"text":"NEVER EVER EVER GO HERE! This place is ridiculous I am not sure if it is bad management or greedy owners, but the service here is awful. There are only a handful of employees which equals a long wait for expensive mediocre food.  The first time I came here was on a Sunday morning so I chalked up the wait and the mediocre food to the fact it was Sunday morning. Today I arrived at 12:00 and waited for 20 minutes to be sat. I was rushed to order as soon as I sat down so I ordered and after an hour of waiting for our food I left the money for my drink on the table and left. I will not be returning and will stick to blueberry hill when  I'm craving breakfast food. If you have two hours to wait then go here but if not I suggest you go SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Damn! Really good. I had chicken waffles w/ eggs biscuit and gravy it was on point. Havent had chicken waffles in years. Will come back when i visit vegas. Ultimate steak and eggs was just as equally as good."}
{"text":"Finally I got to try this place. We walked in and the friendly service sat us down to enjoy the the beautifully decorated place. Everything from the pot of bread to my own customized omelet was amazing. I would highly recommend Rise & Shine to anyone who likes quality food and great service. Now I need to go back to try lunch!;)"}
{"text":"Average at best! WAY over priced for the quality. I got the cup o bread with my breakfast, over baked then over microwaved tough and chewy.... yet crunchy and dry on part! Had the ham steak and eggs, eggs were fine, ham was ok. Hashbrowns were cold and over cooked, and the green onion in them were burnt black. Coffee and breakfast with tax was $17.43 for one. And that was with the regular coffee. The French press coffee is almost $6 for 3 refills. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"RATING: B +

SERVICE: B

AMBIANCE: B 

OVERVIEW: Great variety on their menu. The presentation of the food was one of the best parts of this spot. Nothing too special about this place. Definitely a great breakfast spot to check out. They have a wide array of different coffee options. I will definitely return if I am in the mood for a breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I can't think of a better place to eat breakfast.  The menu is great and the service was friendly and fast.  Will certainly be returning to this spot.  Good job"}
{"text":"Rise & Shine is a local breakfast place by our neighborhood.  We've frequented it a few times and the service and food has always been on point. Yesterday they really showed their 5+ star service.  My family had our reunion this weekend and we had trouble finding a place that could accommodate our large party.   At last minute i thought of Rise & Shine and Liam the manager was able to book us @ 9:30am (busiest time on Sunday morning) As we filtered in more and more of my family showed that we hadn't expected. never did it throw them off.  We were a total of 52 people.  Our server Vanessa and the rest of the staff rocked it.   There was a couple of missed orders but to be expected.  Overall all 52 people enjoyed and were happy (hard feat to accomplish) Wanted to give the last shout out to the gal that passsed tickets out and made paying easy (sorry didn't catch your name).   Thank you again for such awesome service and ending our reunion with delicious food."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends here for brunch. Ordered: chicken and waffles, cinnamon crunch French toast platter, corned beef and hash, steak and eggs, and pot of bread. My friend got his chicken and waffles and the chicken was undercooked. The staff was nice enough to change it quickly. I ordered the cinnamon crunch French toast, it was pretty good, nothing special really. I love the warm cinnamon syrup they serve. The pot of bread is basically cinnamon bun in a cup. It got hard quickly so I kinda didn't like it. Banger sausage and hash brown were so good. I usually love my hash browns well done, crunchy, and we'll seasoned. And of course, steak and eggs were on point."}
{"text":"HUGE portions!!! I thought Omelet House portions were huge but this place puts their portions to shame. Food was good, nothing overly special about it for me. The value is there and that's what matters. Wish they opened at 6am instead of 7am, but oh well. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The decor was bright and wonderful.  Our server looked totally comfortable in her pajama uniform which reflected in her excellent service.  The French pressed coffee was delicious especially next to the yummy pot of bread.  The place misses the mark in the steak and eggs.  They were just not cooked to the way I ordered but still good.   I will totally come back try more on the menu."}
{"text":"The staff here was friendly but the food was sub par. There were a lot of weird twist to the breakfast plates that weren't explained on the menu when you order. Pancakes were probably the highlight on this menu after trying the spot out 4 different times."}
{"text":"This restaurant has turned into my go to place on the weekends. The staff is friendly and the place has a good atmosphere. Food is all around great, pancakes are yummy, the chicken and waffles are delicious, and the side sausage is like crack for breakfast meat lovers."}
{"text":"Visited this wonderful cafe for the first time today! Absolutely loved the atmosphere, the service was spot on and the food was delicious! It was busy so I know it is here to stay! Will be taking the family there soon!"}
{"text":"Concept is cute.  Decor is fun and waitresses uniforms consist of pajamas and slippers.  The food was pretty good, but prices seemed a bit expensive.  I do like that they offer French press coffee, it was a nice surprise.  I have been there a few times and the service differs every time.  The waitresses are always very nice but it seems as though they are taking their time.... This morning we were sitting at the table waiting to put in our order for 15 minutes or so while the waitress was rolling silverware.  Menu was kind of small but they have a few fun surprises such as chicken and waffles and pretty yummy oatmeal.  I'll go again because it's close... But wouldn't venture out of my way to dine here."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, moderately priced fantastic food. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Yum! This place is our new favorite breakfast spot! Everything on the menu is awesome! The prices are a little high for a breakfast joint- but totally worth it! The staff is super friendly and the decor is very cute!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are creatures of comfort.  Our breakfast options usually consist of either Egg Works, Babystacks, or burritos at Roberto's.  We were out and about last weekend and had a hankering for some waffles.  Straight-forward enough, but surprisingly hard to find.  This place pops up on Yelp so we give it a go.

Daaaang.  The service was phenomenal.  Our waitress was on the ball, making sure our coffee was topped off and that we had anything we could possibly want.  The Lavazza coffee was ok, though not as mind-blowing as I would have thought from hearing people talk about it.  It's no Douwe Egberts, that's for sure.  My wife got the Nutella latte, which was ludicrously delicious.

The waffle and cinnamon french toast were fantastic.  Do not miss out on the pot of bread with a side of some outrageously addicting sugary dipping substance that should probably be outlawed.

I sure wish this place wasn't so far from where we are in Henderson.  It's a heck of a trek.  Also, be aware that this location does not feature all of the items pictured on the menu.  I would have loved to have tried the Oreo Butterscotch Pancakes, but that will require a trip to the other location."}
{"text":"This place was great, really. It was on a Sunday morning and had to wait about 25 minutes but it was totally worth it. We went to the bar next door and had a drink or 2 while we waited. Service was awesome with friendly staff wearing pajamas. Nothing on the menu jumped out at me and I went for the waffles and made it I a platter with bacon and eggs. As basic as that sounds, it was amazeballs. Everyone I was with loved their meals as well. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and helpful. Fresh juices and smoothies are delicious. Food is good - sometimes items might come out incorrect but they are always quick to fix the problem! Large portions so I normally order from the children's menu !"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town! Great service too! Food always come out perfect!
French press coffee is awesome! And you cant get enough of the pot of bread!"}
{"text":"I took my 1 yr old grandson for breakfast and he fell in love with the French toast. My rating would totally be 5 stars, and I would be here a couple times a week, but the prices are a little high. I loved the decor, my grandson loved the umbrellas hanging up, and our server. I forgot his name, but he was amazing. Loved the syrup, of course the container was really hot and I'm glad I didn't let my grandson touch it, maybe a warning that it's hot, wouldn't had let him hold it, but when I poured it, he would try and touch. Bottom line, I Love it. Just wish it was a little budget friendly."}
{"text":"Since I visited the 9827 W Flamingo Road location, my review will be on there :)"}
{"text":"My go to breakfast joint. They just opened up a new location, been there, but I prefer the one in southern highlands. But it's getting to busy, my secret spot not so secret anymore..lol. My favorite is the house made corn beef and hash, quality meat! I love there pot of bread but these past years they turned it into an espresso cup, more like a bite, no good and with there success I would like it to go back to a pot, please."}
{"text":"Great food. Definitely a good \"local\" spot that's away from the strip. Most importantly, great friendly service. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast place in the southern highlands area.  Had steak and eggs was cooked perfect  all the food at the table was awesome."}
{"text":"They are lucky to even recieve one star , but I wanted to make sure this posted. When a person orders a steak request medium and recieves something they can not put a knife through is absurd. I do not believe the cooks even know the difference in temperatures,or whether or not it is even cooked. Case in point order a medium receive a well done piece of rubber where a hacksaw could not cut through. or recieve on a second request fatty plate that has blood in it. DO yourself a favor not only avoid the non fully cook hasbrowns avoid recieving a belly ache , save your money at 12+ DOLLARS A PLATE AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE ... THis place sucks and will never see my money again"}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved in to this part of town and when going shopping to Smith's saw this place and have been wanting to try it. We finally went this morning and it was reaaaally good! My husband got some eggs and steak and he inhaled the plate in no time! I got a classic eggs, bacon, hash b. Potato and there was nothing left on that plate! Both dishes came with option of biscuit, french toast or a bread roll in a cup, since my husband and I could not decide which one to choose, the lady that helped us just got them all for us! They also have fresh squeezed OJ. I asked if it was really fresh OJ or the tropicana (bottled one) and she told me she squeezes the oranges herself! Too bad they run out of it! I'm definitely coming back and getting it!."}
{"text":"I really like this place since it's so close to my home.  The food is good, the people are friendly.  However, when you see all the servers handling dirty dishes and then grab the toast out of the toaster with their bare hands, that just won't work for me.  I quit going there about 2 years ago for this very reason.  Then a friend told me they had quit doing that so I went back about 2 weeks ago.  Unfortunately they're still doing it.  I brought it to my servers attention and he said \"Oh yeah, we're not supposed to be doing that.  I'll get you some more and I'll use gloves this time.\" Obviously, what goes on behind the scenes is probably much worse that this, but when they do it in front of you, it just makes you wonder how bad it really is behind the counters.  I'm done.  I wonder how many others observe this activity and just don't come back rather than saying anything."}
{"text":"This place hits the spot.  French pressed coffee is excellent, fresh squeezwd oj and delicious food.  This place made me a member of the clean plate club."}
{"text":"I used to love this place and the service. I come in here this morning the manager or owner is arguing with a couple. We finally get seated and the server is rude and they don't have what I want on the menu. I'll never come here again. Worst breakfast place ever I'd rather go to egg and I there service and food their is great. And they actually do have coffee cake unlike the pot of bread here."}
{"text":"Went for the first time this weekend with some friends and loved it. I had the Loco Moco and it was terrific. The gravy tasted like a brown gravy/teriyaki sauce and it was delicious. Eggs were cooked perfectly, the ribeye beef patty was tasty on it's own and combined with the rest of the dish it was perfect. I ate everything on my plate. I also added a cup of bread, which was basically a cinnamon roll in a mug with a sweet and tangy cream cheese frosting served on the side. I left full and happy. I want to go back and try the S'mores Waffles. This place is kind of far from where we live, but I will make the drive to go back again."}
{"text":"I travel for work and have ate at a lot of places this one is definitely #1! Great food and fantastic service"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we're going to stay away from this location after our last time here. We both ordered the steak & eggs, cooked medium... and both of ours came out looking burnt. And not surprisingly, both steaks were very well done. We're usually not ones to complain, but when our server came by to ask how the food was... well, we brought it up and she offered to have the kitchen cook up another steak. So okay, cool.  Sadly the next steak she brought out was even more well done than the original. How that was even possible, who knows. She offered another time to have another steak cooked up medium. 

How it was possible who knows, but each steak brought out was progressively cooked more and more well done.  There was absolutely no hint of pink in the middle or the sides or anywhere for that matter. The server was getting exasperated herself and kept apologizing profusely, and we didn't blame her at all. It wasn't her fault. But even after all that, the most they could do was take 15% off our bill.  That was a little disappointing. They failed to deliver an edible steak, and it felt like the fair thing would be to take one of the steak&egg orders off the bill. Especially when it was their kitchen staff's fault for messing up so badly, four different times. We didn't think it was a fair gesture, but we weren't going to make a big fuss over it. We're simply not ever going to return to this location.  

Sad because we enjoyed the first couple visits here."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Came with a group and Ry our server was awesome. Service was great and food was wonderful. Have to try the Chilaquiles. Yummy! Coffee was excellent."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat.  We ordered: the banana and frosted flake pancakes, the cinnamon crunch French toast, the steak omelet, and the ultimate steak and eggs..... All dishes were excellent.  Above all else, the food was top-notch.  We were seated quickly, and the waitress was friendly.  The food is a bit pricy, but it's all well worth it.  Highly recommends it!"}
{"text":"Came in with my wife and friends for breakfast. It was our first time there. Menu had a wide selection of menu items. Our server Chris was so happy  and cheerful. Asked us if this was our first time here? Suggested some of her favorites. Went with Steak and eggs one of her favorites,  and my wife went with the servers suggestion  Veggie Benedict. Server told us about the pot bread she was so excited about us trying it. Food was quick and we loved our food. Server was attentive asked how we were doing. My wife and friends loved the atmosphere.  All the servers wore pajamas. Prices were fair. Chris was one of the best waitress we had in a while. Definitely well be back for the food and to see Chris again."}
{"text":"Food and service was great. Place was busy but we only had to wait 5 mins. Portions are big. I had the s&s burrito (see pic)"}
{"text":"This place is great! Breakfast is made to order and perfect every time! Clean, spacious and a cute gimmick with the pajamas. Love living close to this spot!"}
{"text":"Won't ever visit this place.  I ordered TO GO.  Yes, they were busy but after 25 minutes my food was not ready.   My daughter asked about our order and they had the nerve to try to give me my order that was sitting on the counter for at least 15 minutes. Made them give me a new order.  I will just eat on the northwest side of town from now on."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on Yelp!  I'm glad we came for breakfast. Friendly and wonderful service...food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite breakfast place.  However since the expansion the prices went up and the portions got smaller.  They're trying to be more fancy with slimmer cups so the milk you get is half of a regular glass.   I had a 3 egg meal and I know what I was served was not 3 eggs.  
It's sad because we came here frequently but now I think we'll find somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 15 times in the past 4 months and I have to say this is the very best place I have ever ate breakfast. Everything on the menu is great with plentiful servings, the place is super clean, the waitresses are all very friendly they make you feel good as soon as you walk in the door and their dress code is pajamas \"how cool\", this place also has a very nice decor. 

Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"Loved my breakfast! Prepared just how I like it, good service & clean premises. I could do without the waitresses in their jammies, but that doesn't downgrade my rating. Thanks!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant meal. We enjoyed the egg white and grilled chicken omelette, sunrise burrito, and silver dollar pancakes with fresh fruit. Everything was fresh and top quality.  We loved the cup o'bread too!  The cute servers in PJs and flower umbrellas above. I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"I order the biscuits and gravy to go.  I love 3 minutes away from this terrible establishment and by the time I got home I tried to cut into the biscuits and they were harder than a rock.  I even tried a steak knife to no avail.  I proceeded to call them back and the lady asked me if I want them remade.  I said absolutely not but u can refund my money since I couldn't eat what I just ordered.  Then I was told that they can't and won't do that.   By far the worst breakfast I ever had.  Was not even edible and the fact that I couldn't even get my money back is complete BS.  I will never patronize this place again and I'll make sure non of my friends do either.  Terrible food and service.  You've been warned....."}
{"text":"Awful service, waited 35 minutes to be seated. I asked if we could sit outside and was told the wait would be just as long but a group of younger African american women came 20 minutes after us and were seated IMMEDIATELY.. Why? After we finally were seated it took our waitress 12 minutes to take our order and in the middle of taking our order she walked away!! WTH? She then came back to finish taking our order. The food took 29 minutes and was below average at best. The pancakes tasted like flour or bisquick mix. The eggs were okay, bacon was a bit crispy for my liking. The best part of this restaurant is the maple syrup. Management needs to hire a more friendly and efficient staff. I do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"It shouldn't take 10 minutes to be seated (as a single diner) at an empty bar. Nor should it take another 10 minutes  before someone greets you and offers coffee...which never happened.  So, I got up and left."}
{"text":"Great local breakfast spot!! Staff is always friendly!! Love that they are all in pajamas! Food is great and I love their fresh juices!! Do yourself a favor and order fresh oj!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THE FOOD HERE!!
The service is slow every time, they take forever to seat you but its worth it. I love the chilaquiles & the Salsa Verde burrito is good too. I try something new every time and never disappoints. Try the Bagel Egg & Steak sandwich!!"}
{"text":"once again.. satisfaction! if y'all havent tried this place.. its a MUST! awesome food and awesome service.. i would totally recommend this place to everyone. 

I tried the chicken and waffle today and i must say, the best i ever had. better than Roscoe chicken and waffle in hollywood. kudos to the chef!"}
{"text":"Wow! I live in NYC and have had 50 dollar steaks not taste as good as this place! Super impressed with the quality vs the low price, totally worth skipping the normal ihop, Denny's, etc and trying something new and delicious. Get the spice rubbed rib eye steak chilaquiles!"}
{"text":"It was my birthday and my boyfriend offered to take me to breakfast. We yelped breakfast places and saw that Rise and Shine had gotten some harsh reviews about service, but the bf had been there before and said he didn't remember poor service being an issue. 

We decided to chance it. When we arrived, the hostess (the girl with nose ring) didn't welcome or acknowledge us. We waited and she finally just asked \"how many?\" and then didn't say anything like 'alright just have a seat' or 'it'll be just a minute please' which was awkward. 

Great, I thought. My boyfriend even commented about how awkward it was.

But I have to say that was the last of the disappointment because we were seated in about 5 minutes and our server (girl with glasses) was amazing! 

She was upbeat and kind and always there to keep our waters and coffees full (they serve Illy coffee which is THE BEST). And she was very attentive without smothering us. 

I got the cinnamon toast crunch french toast. It was actually a little burned. But it was still yummy. I ordered it as a platter so it came with sausage and eggs. 

Boyfriend ordered corned beef hash and liked it. It came with a pot of bread which really is like a little roll. It's cute but my guy was like \"uhh do I just pull this out and eat it?\" It's nothing too special. It has a cinnamon swirl in the middle which he shared with this birthday girl ;) 

We saw the owner, who has been mentioned in previous reviews, running around the restaurant seemingly doing stuff, at least very active, wearing slacks and a dress shirt. 

In summary:
If the french toast wasn't a little burned it would've been AMAAAZING. Although it was still enjoyable. 

Maybe the owner should have a talk w the hostess about how she's the first impression anyone who comes in gets of the establishment. 

Order their coffee because Illy is the best!!

Overall, my boyfriend and I felt that it was evident that they read the yelp reviews and make adjustments accordingly. We thought this was great."}
{"text":"Just sat down and ordered. I always start a review with 5 stars and work down from there. 

This place has an awesome menu - I had a hard time deciding, so I went for eggs eggs Benedict because it's my fave. Doug and the baby had pancakes and Doug had bacon on the side. He also ordered watermelon strawberry juice, which he didn't like. I took a sip and can see why - it's an all natural juice with no added sugar. Not really a kids beverage; I, on the other hand, loved it.

They brought out warm syrup!!! That wowed me. But the pancakes didn't need it. They were fluffy and light and had their own sweetness to them that made them delicious plain. The eggs Benedict had an unexpected but interesting balsamic reduction drizzled on top that made me an instant fan. I didn't get to try Doug's bacon because he devoured all 5 pieces before I got a chance but it looked great. Sightly thick and cooked perfectly. 

The decor was cute, umbrellas for lights and fans and the servers wore pjs:) LOVED IT!!

If I lived in Vegas, this would be my go to breakfast place!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has 4 stars.. It should clearly be 2-3 due to the lack of service. They are so slow!!! They wear pajamas and the pajamas fit their service. I don't even want to talk about the food bc no matter how good or bad the food was.. The service made it all taste terrible!!!!!!!! Bad bad service I can't stress enough. They are so slow it blows my mind. Only come here if u hv a 2 hour breakfast window. And it wasn't even busy when this whole meal was happening."}
{"text":"I love this place! My husband and I come every weekend :) good food, great servers, great atmosphere! I love the servers in pjs and the umbrellas on the ceiling.  restaurant with personality!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's going on with this place. I used to love it. Becoming complacent perhaps? 2 attempts at a ribeye to make it rare and it was well done every time. Then I was still charged almost the same when they added the eggs and hash browns a la Then the audacity to charge me $3 for gravy too. Very disappointed here.."}
{"text":"We had the homemade corned beef and hash, steak and eggs chilaquiles, the ultimate steak and eggs which came with cup of bread. Definitely come back again"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great atmosphere, great service, and most of all great food. You must try the French press coffee."}
{"text":"This place is rad... Their steak omelet is on point. Also try the jalapeño hot sauce on the rack it's so good."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood breakfast place. Cute staff dressed in PJs. Heard they are expanding which is good because there's always a big line..."}
{"text":"Few times I am surprised when it comes to brkfst. Eggs are eggs. This place really rocks. Stopped by on the way home to LA. 

Best steak & Eggs for the hubby. Kids loved the pot of bread. I recommend the corned beef hash extra crispy. The french press coffee a plus! 

Take the family. U won't be disappointed. Ask for Lisa. Just the sweetest waitress ever. The pjs are a cute touch."}
{"text":"Food was good, atmosphere was cute, but WAY overpriced for just some breakfast. Small place so a little crowded. Overall, not worth the wait or price."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice so far and both times our meals were excellent. The staff is super friendly and the service is top notch. 

The first time I was there I got the steak and eggs with the pot of bread. I absolutely loved the hash browns. 

The second time I got an egg white omelette with spinach, avocado and salsa.  The salsa is delicious. 

Overall, this place is a great value with delicious food and wonderful service. A++"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! From the umbrellas hanging from the ceiling to the servers in pajamas. The coffees were yummy and they have a juice bar!  Between the six of us we had practically everything on the menu, and everyone loved their food. Chicken & waffles, biscuits & gravy, Crunchy Cinnamon French Toast, and Bananas Frosted Flake Pancakes were all totally over-the-top good! It was one of my daughters birthdays and they brought her a \"pot of bread\" with whipped cream, sprinkles, and a pink candle. She said that, and the servers in jammies made it her favorite 
Wonderful food & great service. We will definitely be back any time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast I had in Vegas. Unbelievable food with great prices. Such a refreshing break from the food on the strip. Definitely have to go back for more."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.  Nothing great.

Server ruined the dining experience.   I was trying to explain the menu to my elderly father and the server insists on speaking over us to get the order in at her convenience.  

Also, she had the nerve to sit where we (my father, sister and I) were seated to take the order of the table next to us.   This happened 7-27-2014.   She (server) was obnoxious in behaving that way.   Aside from that, she refilled our drinks quickly."}
{"text":"Best place to come when you are visiting Vegas cheap great service and very very amazing food"}
{"text":"Over priced for mediocre  food. Almost everything on the menu starts at $12.99 per dish. Plain old breakfast with waffles/pancakes/eggs shouldn't  cost $12.99 an order. The waffles came out soggy and cold. Service was really really slow."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Everything was amazing. We had a big group and got some breakfast and lunch plates.  Everything was bomb from soup to pancakes....staff was friendly and helpful.... thank god I live close so I can be a regular from now on.
Ps try the chicken wrap"}
{"text":"Ultimate breakfast place.  Delicious food, great decor, awesome service!   I had the cinnamon toast crunch French toast.  I couldn't stop eating it...to die for!  Friends had the hash browns and omelets and loved it.  Will be back to try their other menu items!"}
{"text":"New place for us, tried it because a friend recommended it.  Servers are dressed in PJ's, ours was prompt and polite.  Smaller menu, a little more pricey than most breakfast joints.  The kitchen is open air , so with the radio blasting, cooks singing along to the music, and the constant shuffle of the plates and silverware it's a bit noisy.  Distracting from the nice quiet breakfast we were expecting.

 I ordered the Steak/Spinach Benedict and she ordered the Ham and egg Benedict  My plate has a good sized portion, but once I cut into the steak I find its mostly gristle and fat. The hash-browns were good. 

 The Ham and egg Benedict was missing hollandaise, and the  aged-balsamic sauce.  Requested from our waitress and promptly received. 

Probably will not be returning to dine again, the noise was a big factor."}
{"text":"Had Breakfast there this morning.  By the way we've been going there since it opened and still like their food.  Husband ordered Chicken Fried Steak and I had Biscuits and Gravy.  Tasty as always, but as always I had to send it back because it comes out Luke Warm. 

We were disappointed to find out that when my husband asked for additional gravy because the gravy that comes with Chicken Fried Steak does not cover it.  To get more it costs $3.95 for that small small bowl. 

 Not good to start charging for something you didn't charge for before.  Give enough to cover the dish that is ordered so that you customers don't feel slighted."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd attempt to try this restaurant,...and the last!  Standing in front of the hostess stand for 10 minutes,...with hostess on other side of stand,...empty tables available, and hostess never once looked up!  When I asked how long of a wait,... She still basically ignored us.  There was at least 2-3 additional parties forming A line, waiting to be acknowledged!  Another waitress. Also came by and returned menus, but also ignored everyone!  Horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"In Vegas for a week vacation and went to Rise & Shine for breakfast.  I have been to many great breakfast locations in the U.S.; this is truly one of the best and they have reasonable prices.  I had the Chicken and Waffles...the chicken was battered prefectly, it was juicy and tasty.  The waffle was delicious and they used real maple syrup with cinnamon sticks inside the bottle.  I also had an excellent banana smoothie.  The service was fast and delivered with a smile.  Overall, very satisfying.  A must when visiting Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Food was good and plentiful and the staff were great. Loved the PJs each one wore and the t-shirts worn by the bus people (\"spooning leads to forking\") were fun!  I had the breakfast burrito and my husband had the stack of 4 pancakes - both were excellent. Always had hot coffee and wait staff seemed to really like their job. Made me happy to be there."}
{"text":"Chicken Cobb Salad is the best I've ever had. Only breakfast before, but my Realtor and I had lunch there today. Get a to go box. Can't eat it all even if you try."}
{"text":"My fiance came here about a month ago and could not stop raving about it.  So today we tried it with some friends visiting from out of town.  For starters, service was great!  Most of the employees looked happy and comfortable in their pj's. Which is a great concept accept when you can see lint balls on the fabric.  Not very visually appealing. 

So, 3 of us ordered some kind of steak and asked for it to be cooked either medium or medium-rare. They all came out well. For a place that is advertised as a \"steak and eggs\" restaurant one would think they can cook steaks correctly.  

My friend did say this place is a \"hit or miss\" place.  Today was a miss."}
{"text":"Wow I can't believe all these good reviews for this place! I was so excited when this place opened cause I love breakfast spots and this is literally a block away from my house. Went about six months ago and had the worst experience. There was only two other tables occupied and couldn't believe how slow the service was. ordered basic breakfast of eggs over bacon home fries and toast plus fresh orange juice. The eggs were overdone and the potatoes were so strange. Consistency and texture of glue! Yuck!!! The only thing good was the fresh squeezed juice. Was so damn dissapointed. Chalked it up to another crappy place in Southern Highlands. Wonder if something has changed in the last 6 months... Maybe I will try it one more time. Did I catch it on a VERY off day?? Hmm"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.  The staff serves you in their pajamas.   Feels like home!  Food is great.... have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went back gave them another shot after the gm responded to my post. They did not know I was coming in and the service was great food was good again. 

This place does care!"}
{"text":"First time here for, Natasha (wife) and I.
The place is very nicely decorated and the kitchen; which you can see into, is very clean.
We sat at the bar and had a clear view of the action in the kitchen. The cooks were all in a good mood and suggested a couple of dishes. We ended up ordering the chilaquiles, and chicken and waffles. 
They were big servings. The food was crafted with care and prepared fresh before us. 
The kitchen staff was also very entertaining.

Overall the food is fresh and very tasty, it is prepared with care and attention to detail. The place offers a nice atmosphere for small and large groups. The wait staff was also attentive but never overbearing. 
 
Great place, so don't be shy and give it a try."}
{"text":"This is our go to breakfast spot! We absolutely love Rise and Shine! The eggs benedict is ourstanding!"}
{"text":"After coming back a couple of times, we kept getting really disappointing service. 

They also have too many bad table locations with zero ambiance. Especially if you come in after the morning rush since multiple tables stay dirty for long periods of time. 

There are important factors other than food that make a cafe a good one, in my opinion. 

We tried their Summerlin location but that one has even worse customer service. It must be a chain thing. 

Save yourself some money and time. 

There are way too many great breakfast places in this city to go to a mediocre one like this one."}
{"text":"First time here recommended by one of my friends great coffee great pancakes awesome biscuits and gravy worth the 15 minute drive from the strip"}
{"text":"I am so happy we found this place!! We were leaving Vegas and wanted some breakfast outside of Vegas and on the way home to CA.  Found this cute place off Yelp.  

Hubby ordered their Ultimate steak and eggs which comes with a ribeye, eggs, and hash browns.  I ordered their special which was Southern friend chicken breast and biscuits with eggs.  I was so happy when it came out, I couldn't wait to dig in.  I fell in love at first bite!  

We definitely will be stopping by again whenever we make it out to Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have had breakfast (biscuits and gravy) and lunch (French onion soup and California salad-I think).  Service was good the first time (lunch) and great the second time."}
{"text":"I don't EVER get out of my downtown and China town bubble, but I was diggin on this chick that lives right around this place and we went there for breakfast one day. The outside doesn't make it look very appealing, but once inside the wait staff and management were super friendly and attentive to all of our needs. I ordered the chicken fried steak ( which was an actual breaded steak! ) the scrambled eggs and the pot of bread which were absolutely amazing!  I loathe going to the suburbs even for a hookup, but I would go that far this food. ( that says quite a bit about the food if I wouldn't drive there for a hookup, but I would drive there for this food)  I hope they open one close to downtown, so I can leave The Egg and I and go to this place!!!"}
{"text":"Me and the wife were getting tired of the old chain restaurant breakfast places like Denny's and IHOP. As well as the mostly crappy casino breakfast buffets In our area of Anthem Highlands.. Green Valley ranch buffet is just garbage and the M is a little better but still tastes like casino breakfast buffet food.. 

So i simply went to google and typed in best breakfast las vegas and Rise & Shine showed up on yelp with a solid 4 star rating, So we decided to give it a shot and i'm glad we did!!

 We showed up on a saturday morning around 1030am and were seated right away. The place seems clean and up to date with ipad registers.. The waitress came to our table within 3 minutes of us sitting there and took the drink orders and asked if we need a few minutes to look over the menu.. Upon her return I Ordered the Ultimate steak&eggs breakfast with the optional 3 eggs with a Pot of Bread\" I didn't know what it was either so i just ordered it,.. Its basically a cinnamon roll baked in a small pot,.. The wife ordered the Belgian waffle platter with a side of hashbrowns.. The food came out piping hot after only about 15 minutes. 

The food was very delicious and the portions were decent. The ribeye had a very delicious spice rub that made the steak hardly require any steak sauce and it was very tender., Our drinks were also filled very promptly without even asking.\"A Pet Peeve of mine\" I'm only knocking a star because the ribeye steak was a little on the thin side and i asked for Medium and it came out Medium Well. Also i asked for Over Medium eggs and they came out Over Easy. But Overall the food was Fantastic and we left full. $34 not including tip. We will definitely be returning.!"}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas this weekend on our way out of town we stumbled across this gem. The Waitress was lovely and the food delicious with quick service. The only thing that would make the place my go to spot when in town would be some gluten free options! Hope to see that in the future!"}
{"text":"Place was okay, food items were wayyyy overly prices and food was sub par honestly, dont care to ever come back here breakfast failure"}
{"text":"The food is great!!! Tried a lot on the menu. the best is probably the spice rubbed chilaquiles. It's out of this world! They have really good coffee and juice selections. It's a must try if your in the area. Oh and the wear their PJ's super comfy place."}
{"text":"The hostess in the pink and black polka dot pajamas was bitchy rude seated people before us when asking about it got snotty attitude   The food was sub par eggs Benedict came hard boiled. As the waiter he was sorry and was told they were short staffed. Not into excuses.  They did give  a small discount on the Benedict. 2 bites of the Benedict and was done."}
{"text":"I should have written this review a long time ago. We HAD been customers of this establishment from the day they opened their doors.  In the beginning, it was great! Great service, Great food, etc... slowly it all started to diminish.  Our last visit was HORRIBLE, we waited forever for the not so busy waitress to take our order, then waited even longer for our food. Never received a refill of coffee the entire time we were there.  I asked the manager when we were leaving if it had changed hands, and he said no.  I wrote a comment card requesting the owner call me. never received a call. When I received their monthly email, I replied to it asking that someone contact me about the HORRIBLE service we received and still never received a call.. Instead they removed me from the email list, because that was the last time I received an email from them

There are MUCH better options in Southern Highlands, this place is WAY WAY overpriced for what you receive... Take your money some place else!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is our favorite meal of the day and we were so excited when we found this local breakfast spot.  The wait is long on the weekends but definitely worth it.  I love eggs benedict and their steak and eggs benedict is delicious!  Don't forget to get the pot of bread with your entree."}
{"text":"We love this place!! The service always quick and friendly and the juice bar is to die for! The open kitchen concept makes it fun to see how the kitchen runs and works so hard! The wait staff are dressed in PJs which is exactly how you wish you were really dressed before the coffee and first meal of the day, (or last;))They offer a variety of great food for both lunch and dinner. Breakfast meals set the tone for the day and we always leave here highly satisfied, thank you to all the staff!! We will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict with balsamic is amaaaazing! Great customer service and low wait times for seating and food delivery. Check this place out for a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast, cute decor. The breakfast options are very good and the prices are reasonable. The service was not bad either. When I am in town I would come back here for breakfast."}
{"text":"So the first thing you notice are the floral umbrellas on the ceilings. The servers uniforms are unique are wearing Pajamas. The staff is friendly. 

The \"must try pot of bread\" was alright. It was a little hard. The presentation was cute. However, it is messy to eat because of the sprinkles of powder. I got a biscuits instead it was a little crispy and toasted too much. 

The ultimate steak and eggs was good. 
The side of bacon was too crispy.

Overall this place is alright."}
{"text":"I took my wife here after reading all the reviews on Yelp. This is officially our FAVORITE breakfast place EVER! -- FAIR WARNING: Once you eat here it's going to be hard to eat at places like Denny's and IHOP again, it's that good!

My wife had Chicken and Waffles with Pot of Bread (Cinnamon) and iced tea.

I had Steak and chilaquiles (just a fancy word for nachos) with eggs over easy + French Pressed coffee to drink -- I also ordered some extra gravy with the biscuit that came with my meal

Our whole meal was about $35... not too bad.

Everything tasted PERFECT -- The coffee had me on 10,000 hyper mode and my appetite kicked in... and the added surprise was that the \"nachos\" had this BBQ beans on it -- you let that egg run + avocado + bbq beans + sour cream and the blend is CRAZY GOOD

My wife said it was the best fried chicken she's ever had and the batter they used was to die for. The waitress was sweet enough to give my wife some FREE cinnamon cream cheese stuff (that NORMALLY goes on the red velvet pancakes) for her pot of bread because the waitress tried it herself before and was basically suggesting we try that. Love tips like this."}
{"text":"I consider myself a connoisseur of corned beef hash, finding myself ordering it almost every breakfast restaurant I go, often being greatly disappointed with the dog food-like slop I am frequently served which is lacking in color, flavor, and texture.  

However, my trip to Rise & Shine a steak and egg place provided me with one of the best corned beef hash entrees I've ever had. The pulled corned beef had a great sear on it with a nice malliard browning along with some caramelized onions, red skin potatoes, and two eggs over easy and I was in corned beef nirvana.  The owners really spent some time perfecting this simple yet amazing dish.

The place is quaint with a creative decor and spinning umbrellas line the ceiling, a friendly homey staff and lavazza coffee, fresh pressed orange juice made fresh daily make it a breakfast spot not to miss!  Rumor is they are opening up another one in summerlin.  Can't wait to try it!"}
{"text":"Wow! Talk about generous portions, this place was very good.  We found it on Yelp and the other reviews were right on. From the pajama clad servers, to the pleasant atmosphere, I'd return here again and again. The prices were not inexpensive, but the food was tasty and ample. From pancakes to French toast, OJ that tasted fresh squeezed (I don't know if it actually was) and coffee that was satisfying, the experience was good and worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"This place was a little more unique with servers wearing pajamas as their uniforms, and cool decorated parasol lights and fans hanging from the ceiling. We got seated right away although it was busy. It was nice being able to get fresh squeezed orange juice and other juices there. The food was overpriced though and honestly not as good as Ihop omelettes and hashbrowns. Eggs seemed a little overcooked and not as seasoned and fluffy as Id like and not enough cheese in the  omelette. The cup o bread is unique and like a fluffy fresh baked tiny bread roll with frosting to dip it in. I recommend it. Servers were nice and got us everything we needed. Overall it was ok, but i wouldnt miss it if I never went again."}
{"text":"Took my daughters for a late breakfast and because I had eaten earlier, I opted for a cheeseburger. Man alive, I couldn't believe how great it was. 

Burger was great... cooked perfectly, tasty and hard to finish. Fries were crispy and season perfectly.  I've eaten burgers all over town, including on the strip.  This burger is now toward the very top of the list. 

Only negative? $30 (plus tip) for a kids meal, an order of pancakes and a burger."}
{"text":"Just had our first experience here and we were very favorably impressed with the food and the service. The hostess and cashier were super nice and seemed genuinely happy that we were there on a busy Sunday morning. Our waitress, Maria, did a great job explaining the menu and providing attentive service. Our food came out hot and delicious. I tried pancakes and eggs and was really surprised how delicious the food was. It was a conservative first try but I feel if they get that right other options are worth checking out next time. My wife really enjoyed the salmon and Lox omelet. I highly recommend this spot for a nice breakfast experience."}
{"text":"In every way, this place is 5-star. The menu offers a wide variety of sweet (the cinnamon crunch French toast was the best French toast I've ever had-no exaggeration) and savory (country fried steak and eggs-yummmm!!!). Our waitress, Laurel, was friendly and informative without being intrusive. And the decor was well thought-out with plenty of room for each party (i.e., you're not elbow to elbow with the table next to you). Definitely coming back...and
bringing friends and family with me!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place with amazing food. Bright and airy atmosphere and sevice was terrific. We will be adding to our favorites!"}
{"text":"it's not \"Chicken & Waffles....\", but it's \"Chicken & Waffle\"!  and oh my lord is it GREAT!  Freshly Squeezed OJ hit the spot too.. This place is so worth the drive to Southern Highlands.  We went on a Saturday just before noon, and a party of 5 of us only waited less than 10 minutes for a seat.  This is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Service very friendly. Interesting menu with red velvet pancakes, French press coffee, real maple syrup and fresh baked-bread. Southern food offerings like fried chicken & waffles, which comes with homemade cinnamon rolls --what I ordered. In a large shopping center, so tricky to find with just address."}
{"text":"Place is really cute and love the theme of wait staff wearing pj's but the meals were very over priced and the kids pancakes were a joke there were 3 tiny pancakes and the kids' meals don't include drinks.  Glad we tried it but won't go back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  The service very pleasant and fast.  Loved the pajamas the the staff wore."}
{"text":"this place was great, everyone was super friendly, and I was a little jealous that the servers were running around in PJ's and I was wearing normal clothes. 

the food was really good, I got the French Toast, it was super delicious. definitely want to go back and try the other stuff on the menu"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Sweet or savory they have the options. Waitresses are very nice and adorable in their pajama uniforms."}
{"text":"I used to love his place but I am so disgusted by the prices and the service. I have never had a waitress (Amber) be so cold and rude for absolutely no reason. My food was 27 dollars for one waffle, 4 slices of French toast and probably about 4 bites eggs. The ONLY thing that was good about this place was the young girl at the front. She was so busy but still so kind. I gave her more of a tip than the actually \"waitress\" because she actually deserved it."}
{"text":"I ordered the N.Y. Steak and Eggs it was tough and dry.  The eggs were under cooked and the cook took away part of my eggs. Our server never checked back with us to see if everything was ok or to see if we needed refills drinks or coffee."}
{"text":"I'm going to start out by saying that I've been to the Southern Highlands location probably a dozen times, and love it. 
Yesterday my friend and I were out in Henderson, and decided to stop  because he had been to this one before, and enjoyed the loco moco that they don't serve at the SH location. 
I ordered an egg white omelet with chicken sausage, mushrooms and onions, and he ordered the loco moco. I received my \"cup o' bread\" rather quickly, and just like SH, it was fantastic, and thank goodness because that's pretty much when I stopped eating. 

Our food arrived, and I went to put some Tabasco sauce on my eggs. Big mistake! You know how you do things out of force of habit? Well, I foolishly turned the bottle upside down, only to find out the hard way that they had removed the stopper that regulates the pour, resulting in about 3 tablespoons of hot sauce dumped on my omelet. I started to soak it up with napkins, both on top of the omelet, and underneath. figured it would be fine now, so preceded to eat. After a few bites, I lost my appetite. Even after using napkins, there was an absurd amount of butter at the bottom of the plate, and in the omelet itself. I love butter just as much as the next person, but this was a disgusting amount. The other part that disturbs me is that generally when an order for just egg whites is placed, the kitchen usually knows that the person is trying to go the healthier route and doesn't want their food soaked in half a stick of butter (heck, they even have a healthier section on their menu with egg whites listed as the primary options). I finally ended up just picking out some mushrooms and sausage, and quit. 
My friend was struggling with his meal too. He asked me if something was wrong, and I told him it was just soaked in butter, he said his was as well, and that he was getting a little nauseous from it. 
Our waiter came by about 30 seconds after we first received our food and said, \"I know it just got here but is everything ok?\" we foolishly said yes prior to even trying anything. When he returned about 10 minutes later, he didn't even ask if something was wrong considering our food hadn't been touched, he just refilled my friend's drink, and we asked for the check. For a regular brewed coffee, a soda, egg white omelet and loco moco, we ended up with a $35 bill (without tip). We left our 90% uneaten food on the table, paid up front and left. 

Needless to say, I will stick with the SH location from here on out, but honestly, I'm so mad that I wasted $41 including the tip for a meal I didn't even eat, that I might not be going back to that one for a long time either."}
{"text":"Ham steak breakfast is the best I've had in years. Good atmosphere and friendly staff. Will make it a ongoing spot when we return to Vegas for breakfast."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst breakfast place in Las Vegas, the food is disgusting and the service is horrible. I tried it twice due to living only a mile or less away, and I have to say that the second time was even worse than the first. This is perhaps the slowest, rudest, and most offensive place to a foodie palate. If you want a good bite in the morning check out DW Bistro or even EggWorks."}
{"text":"While at a basketball tournament we stopped here between games and it was a very good choice (thanks Yelp). Portions were huge and the breakfast was great. If in town again we'd definitely be back"}
{"text":"Best Corned Beef Hash I've ever had. Soooo good. Also, the eggs were cooked perfectly. The French press coffee was really nice. The bread in a cup was better than I thought it would be. Perfect portion sizes. Off the strip, so not crazy busy, which translated to virtually no wait time. Now I know why this place has so many good reviews."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp last year and couldn't wait to come back. The cup o' bread is awesome! Great breakfast and very nice staff."}
{"text":"Came here on A Saturday for breakfast...  Outstanding food, fun atmosphere (servers are dressed in Pajamas) and pancakes to die for. Love this place...  Will certainly come again. 
The upside down ceiling umbrellas are so creative---"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The moment you walk in, you'll know that you're inside a breakfast establishment as the employees are still in their pajamas. There are also umbrellas on the ceiling which adds a nice touch to the room. I tried the chicken waffle and it was amazing. It's not spicy but the spice in it is really good. It gets your senses going. It came with biscuit but I got charged the gravy on the side and I was not told. If you want a satisfying breakfast, you cannot go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"This was probably the best steak and eggs I've ever had, amazing service. I tried the freshly squeezed orange juice they have, and let me tell you it's taste like you're bitting into an orange. I don't know how else to explain it but it was the best!"}
{"text":"I usually come here because it is around my neighborhood.  Today was really bad.  We had to wait so long for our food which are just eggs and waffles.  The coffee I was given was not hot.  The eggs were overcooked and my son did not get the bananas on his waffle.  The waitress did not even check on us!  I felt like we were being discriminated because we were Asian! I am usually patient and forgiving but I just wanted to walk out.  I will not come here again!"}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast... Perfect service, quaint, clean restaurant. I simply can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"It's too bad I can't leave negative stars. 3 of us saw the great yelp reviews and decided to come. It's not an understatement to say EVERYTHING went wrong: it took a while just to get ice water (no lemon as requested), when the coffee finally came there was grandma pink lipstick predominantly displayed which was replaced with no apology, I ordered the daily special to which the server had no clue what I was talking about and went to check the board himself while telling us the board was new and no one tells him about anything there, I ordered the lox bagel--a few mins later the server came back to ask what bagel I would like--about 10 min after that the server comes back to tell me that the special isn't available until tomorrow. He says the other 2 meals will up out shortly and will bring a menu back to me so I can order something else. We decided to just leave without the food...
This doesn't include the server calling me \"sir\", telling us about how cranky he is in the morning and sharing about how he wrote 'iced' for our waters and couldn't remember if it was tea or water. Fail!"}
{"text":"Was in on September 1st and had server Ashley Silva, the service was excellent and so was the food.  We were visiting from Arizona and she was very polite, helpful and talkative with my guest and I (she at first said she was afraid of my shoulders haha) but she was a great server and started our trip off well.  I would highly recommend this breakfast establishment and A+ service to any local or out of town guest."}
{"text":"First time here. It was great. Our waitress was Laura. She was the best. Even the busboy was a great assist. Try the cup-o-bread!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!!! Friendly and food is ridiculously good..every time we come here or we make it a point to try something different on the menu and everything has been excellent!!They seem to have their own little twist on their menu... food is good and fresh to order flavorful and fun to eat!! Portions are huge so come hungry!!! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place after all of these great reviews and the look of the menu but Rise and Shine fell short of my expectations. I have to say that the atmosphere was nice and we were seated very quickly. The waitress took our drink orders immediately and the service started off great. I was vey excited that they served Illy coffee being a huge coffee fanatic but they ruined a terrific bean and rather expensive one by burning it. This is by far the worst cup of Illy i've ever had. 
The menu look fantastic and my wife ordered the croissant French toast with blue berries and I had the chicken fried steak. The French toast was nothing like advertised and actually should of been called bread pudding since the consistency was equivalent. The mound of fresh blueberries on top was a nice touch. The wife was not to thrilled about the dish probably because mentally she was prepared for something else, I thought it was just okay. My country fried steak was disappointing , extremely chewy with bits of tendons everywhere, the gravy was good and the hash browns was the best part of the dish. Dont be fooled about the picture of the pot of bread, although it appears fancy, it had no taste and was cold. I will give this place another shot someday but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great coffee, Good Food and Friendly wait staff. Solid all around off strip dining."}
{"text":"This place was so delicious! I had the omelet and my boyfriend had the chicken and waffles! Both so good. We loved our server Amber! She was so sweet :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Breakfast was amazing the bread in a cup was delicious, Maria was our server and she did a great job! Great customer service this place is one of my favorite breakfast restaurant."}
{"text":"Really cute breakfast place! Brightens up the morning to see wait staff in PJs and the cute flower \"fans\" dangling from the ceiling and other whimsical decor. Service was friendly like a family diner. This is the place to go for a large breakfast. We tried the steak with poached eggs and bread in a cup. I ordered some extra sides (avocado, eggs, etc.) and there was definitely enough food for two people. The prices are on the higher side which is why it's 4-stars, but it's a nice place to have a family breakfast. They have outdoor seating for nice days or if you are bringing a furry companion."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!!! Great service and atmosphere. Will be back again. Everything is from scratch. Hash browns and chicken fried steak was ridiculously amazing! I had the bagel sandwich with bacon, avacado and turkey. The boyfriend and had chicken fried steak and in a content food coma!"}
{"text":"No complaints about service or attitude.  The place is stripped down diner decor, but neat and clean.  I ordered eggs Benedict and, as an almost after thought the server asked if I wanted Worcester sauce with it .  I said \"yes\" - big, big mistake.  It came with so much Worcester sauce that I could hardly see the eggs.  I'm sure that neither the server nor the cook has ever eaten Eggs Benedict plastered like this.  I tasted nothing but the sauce.  To those who don't eat Worcester sauce:  a little goes a long way.  

Note to management: If you want to offer Worcester sauce, put a bottle on the table and let the customer help himself.  In short: good food (I suppose) ruined."}
{"text":"Such a great breakfast place. I love to go to different restaurants in different cities to try their eggs benedicts, and their's doesn't disappoint. They take a classier approach to the breakfast staple; the classic elements are still there, perfectly toasted English muffin, runny, poached egg, and a creamy hollandaise sauce. But then they top it all off with a balsamic drizzle that is tart and compliments the hollandaise sauce perfectly. It comes with a side of crispy hash browns and don't forget to try their pot of bread! Their pot of bread is a fluffy, lightly sweet, hot piece of cinnamon bread that is served with frosting. Amazing place!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times, and it's always satisfying.

I have been to the Southern Highlands branch and both restaurant have great decor and a lovely staff. 

Today I had the Cup O'Bread and the Rib Eye Steak Chilaquiles and boy, was it tasty. I asked for a medium rare steak and did they deliver! The steak was juicy and nicely charred on the outside, giving it an authentic smokey taste. Though this may have been the main part of the dish, the ranchero chips may have slightly outperformed the steak. Their chips are housemade and seasoned with a multitude of spices, with a basis that seems to be paprika and cayenne pepper. The chips laid on a bed of refried beans and was topped with eggs (any style you choose), avocado, cheddar and cotija cheese. The chips were still crunchy and was served with a side of sour cream and salsa. I recommend getting overeasy eggs, so when you break the yolk it adds an extra sauce to your chips.

Overall a very wonderful experience and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Food and coffee were sooooo good!  I had the eggs Benedict but wanna come back and try their namesake steak & eggs!  I totally need to bring Rick here!"}
{"text":"For a great place to go the morning after a late night of fun, Rise & Shine is the best little secret in South LV.  The ribeye chilaquiles is the perfect cure to that hangover!  

As soon as you walk-in, the air is filled with cinnamon-spiced potted bread that smells and tastes delicious!  The staff is friendly, attentive and will serve you in their PJ's.

If you're coming to visit Vegas and want to take a trip into town, I highly recommend to get yourself down to Rise & Shine! 

Absolutely yummy!"}
{"text":"Updating and Upgrading my Review.

Had a wonderful breakfast here the other day.

In addition to great food, what made it really fantastic was our server, Cary.

Cary made us feel like we were her special guests and certainly her favorite table. Every visit  - whether to take an order, serve a dish, or just to refill coffee, came with a friendly smile, a quick chat, and a laugh. The place was super busy on a Sunday morning, but we felt really taken care of.  We couldn't help but notice that she seemed to be treating her other tables equally well. 

My date is a bartender at a high-end restaurant in town, and his comment was \"She's a serious pro!\". 

This kind of service and attitude - and not just by Cary, but by everyone on the staff that we met - makes it worthy of a five-star review - makes it worth the slightly higher than average prices - and assures that we will be regulars here.

Thank You, and Well Done!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!! Great service and even better food! Huge, home made delicious portions. Very family friendly. Manager is great! We have a 2 yr old and they go out of their way to make every trip fun. Vegas needs more places like this! One of the best breakfast places in town."}
{"text":"Delish!  Loved the crunchy cinnamon French toast.  The bacon was great also.  Portions are HUGE.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"My friend and I have visited this wonderful breakfast place several times and will be back several more. The waitstaff is wonderful always taking care of the customer. The food is excellent. I have nothing bad at all to say. Go visit and try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Trust me when I say get the Chilaquiles! It's a side of sour cream ;) Nothing else even compares to how good things are. The oj and the green go-go juice are my fav drinks."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and feel the service is getting worst each time. Slow service and the orders were wrong. The menu is great and the food just ok."}
{"text":"My kids and I enjoyed our breakfast very much at the Southern Highlands location. Portion sizes are great and we loved the fresh squeezed oj. Ashley was our server and took great care of us. The kids are already asking if we can come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Our last day in Vegas so we hit up Yelp for a suggestion for Steak and Eggs, one of the best meals of the trip, just a few minutes from South Point, open for breakfast and lunch only, great service, fair price, small local place."}
{"text":"Had no idea this place would be as good as the pictures looked. When always reading ratings most people are four stars and rarely fives anymore. This place deserves a 5 or close to it. Great service, interesting choice in attire where the servers where pjs lol but it's cool. Beautiful inside and even more amazing to eat outside on a beautiful morning. 
Besides the appearance and feeling you get being in there comes the food! When going through the pics on here everything g looks good so here is what we found out..... EVERYTHING IS AMAZING AND FRESH AND MOUTHWATERING!!!!! From basic eggs, hash browns to the chicken and waffles and fresh squeezed oj. You got to save room for the bread in a cup thing which should be eaten first or maybe have the waitress wait to bring it out so it's super warm and more amazing. But yes love this place and will be coming here every time we stop in Vegas. 
Oh yeah wait time for party of two was a minute if that so don't worry it's worth it. Thank you for being amazing we love your establishment."}
{"text":"We are new (two years) to the LV Valley, and live in the Seven Hills area of Henderson. There is no lack of restaurants in the area, so we've been doing our best to try new places we've never been before. Sadly, we have tried a few breakfast spots and none have wowed us. Until now. We finally found a decent place with good food. Rise & Shine is a bit far away in Southern Highlands, but at least it's easy traveling time, not near the strip. It's in a outdoor mini mall area with an Ace Hardware store and a supermarket. We had to go to Ace early Sunday, and decided to try the place. It was decent size and cute decor, and the servers wear their pajamas, which took a second to register at first, but cute idea. Big menu, with lots to choose from. My husband had the daily special chicken fried steak and gravy, and loved it. I ordered the chicken and waffles, and was blown away at how good it was. Even better, in my opinion, than Roscoe's in California, but I'm sure some will disagree.

The chicken breast was flattened and fried, but the flavor was rich and deep, and the batter was so crispy and flavorful. I asked, and the server said it was just salt, pepper, and flour, but it must have been dipped in buttermilk, because it really was exceptional. The waffle was light and fluffy, and their logo was stamped in the middle. The piece of chicken was huge, which was good because I took half home and ate it for breakfast the next day.

They have something called a pot of bread, which is a hybrid of a cinnamon roll stuff in a cup. We didn't try it, but will next time.

We were there at 7 am when it opened, so the crowd wasn't big, but they obviously had regular customers with whom they were really friendly.  Only downfall is that it's a bit cher...Our two meals with coffee and a hot chocolate came to about $40. So not something to do everyday, but for a nice Sunday breakfast out."}
{"text":"I was on my way out of town and I wanted that last great meal before I was subjected yet again to horrors of the menu my trainer has had us on for the past 2 months.

This spot is tucked away in a residential neighborhood and if it wasn't for Yelp, I would have missed this breakfast gem.  By the looks of it, it's a locals favorite and a great family restaurant. 

While I waited 20 minutes I reviewed the menu via this wonderful app. The consistent review was the Chilaquiles (Chi-la-key-less) for those non latin tongues. Equally for those who know what traditional Chilaquiles should taste like, these are not it. Although don't discount this dish out. This version is more of a Tex-Mex spin but it's worthy of my taste buds.

Before I started the meal I ordered a good ol' cup of Joe served generously in a large mug fit for the most caffeine frenzied freak. Trust me avoid all offers of carb delights and only order the pot of bread.  This simple but yet inventive cinnamon roll served in a juxtaposed mug of coffee is a must have. Paired with a cup of coffee it reminds you why you woke up this morning... to enjoy life with a slice of sunshine.  Just with this simple start, this establishment lives up to its glorious name. 

Onto the main dish, spiced rubbed ribeye steak chilaquiles. I thought it was served with strips of steak. Oh no my friend, you get a grade cut of steak worthy of any red blooded carnivore. The Chilaquiles are more chips that true tortillas, again more of a Tex-Mex flair. They are layered with refried beans at the base, then layers of cheddar cheese, chips, topped with sour cream, pico de gallo and avocado. With a sprinkle of cotija cheese on it and you are in breakfast heaven. 

The steak was phenomenal and I would gladly have a steak here over Gordon Ramsey's \"Steak\" located in Paris Hotel.  The steak is a fraction of the cost but more importantly it's better tasting. Granted it's not American Kobe beef but it doesn't have to be. The rib eye was seasoned to perfection. 

This is not a light hearted breakfast and if you are like me, you won't have a need to have lunch.  The high ratings is not all hype and is definitely worth checking out. This joint has a cool and laid back atmosphere great for the family. If you want you day to start with a slice of sunshine make sure it starts here."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday, there was a lot of people waiting but the great news is they seat you quickly. We had a party of 3, and got seated with in 10 mins. Our server was extremely nice, tentative, and made sure we were satisfied. The food came out quickly, and it was delicious. Ask for the hash browns to be crispy and they'll make sure they are. I got the steak omelet and pot of bread. Quality of steak was good, cappuccino with hazelnut Nutella did not even taste like coffee tasted like a yummy hot chocolate, and pot of bread was crisp on the top and soft in the inside. Overall good way to start a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is average. Went to exit out a door and was told \"that door is always locked.\"  Sign on the door says \"this door must remain open during business hours. Not sure how I feel taking my son somewhere where safety of customers is ranked below convenience of the staff."}
{"text":"This place is super cute and definitely pleasing to the eye. The decor in there is so cute and the way the servers wear pajamas is adorable. They have an abundance of good breakfast items on the menu, even beyond their steak and eggs. I decided to try the red velvet pancakes because of my sweet tooth, and they came with a side of bacon and eggs. It was all good but nothing to write home about. I still enjoyed them tho and they were very fluffy. It was a giant serving tho with just two pancakes and my sister and friends helped me eat them. 
I tried my sister's steak and it was delicious. If I ever decide to go again I'd probably get that instead. I guess that's what they're known for since it's in the name! 
Besides the food that didn't really blow me away, the service is what is making me take away stars. Wow, our server was acting so strange in a way. I work in the food and beverage industry and hate saying things like that. But seriously in my 21 years of life I have never had such weird service... 
One of our girls asked for butter for her waffle and our server (a girl, don't remember her name) looked disgusted and pointed to my other friend's butter and said \"there's butter right there.\" Acting super confused. ew?? She wanted us to share butter? That's so gross...she had dipped her used knife in it obviously! Then my sister asked for water and once again the server pointed to someone else's water!! Is this like a communal place where we all share food? Then my sister orders salsa for her steak and eggs, and it's put on my plate of pancakes. Good combo. Also, my pancakes came with a special syrup, and it was delivered 10 minutes after my pancakes were. Oh, and that \"fresh\" butter my friend ordered? Came when she was halfway done with her meal. Okay so our server was very unfriendly and acting odd but once the bill came, she asked us how we were for the first time, asked if we were visiting, etc. I get it, you want a nice tip lol. After that experience I really have no desire to return."}
{"text":"The food is delicious.    I loved the biscuits and gravy as well as the chicken fried steak.  The staff dresses in pajamas. Lots of fun."}
{"text":"Went there this morning for the first time... What a cute restaurant all decorated up with flower umbrellas and the servers are wearing pajamas as their uniforms for the \"Good Morning\" feel! We had an amazing experience! Gilbert took care of us and gave us great menu recommendations. When the food came out, we were very impressed with the presentation as well as quality and taste! Overall great food, great staff, and great atmosphere! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"First visit to this restaurant. Decor is bright, lively and comfortable. They make good use of the many windows, and there's an outside eating area. 
Staff uniforms are pajamas - very cute and different. 
Food is delicious. Went with the basics - eggs and pancakes. The syrup is real, heated with cinnamon sticks - a unique twist but not overpowering, just a hint. I use these basics to judge - if they can't make a good pancake, not worth the bother. Not true here - light, fluffy and delicious. Also like they offer full and half stacks!  Next visit will be more adventurous. 
Service was friendly and attentive. 
Only minor complaint - coffee drinkers don't get a saucer, so have to improvise for my spoon."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here and it was our first time in. The food was good but our server really sucked. Her name was Kristie. I thought she had a bit of an attitude when we order water for our beverages because she walked away without saying anything to us, like she was ignoring us & not acknowledging us. But no, that's just how she was. She dropped off my fiancées bagel, I said thank you and she ignored me. Same when she dropped our food off, the check- everything. She charged us an extra $1 on our check, which we usually wouldn't complain about but we didn't have a good experience with her. So we told the host who was ringing us up and I think the manager had her apologize but she only apologized for the extra dollar charged- not her shitty service. When we told the host how she treated us she gave us a friends and family discount- which we weren't looking for a discount but it was a nice gesture. Hopefully Kristie leaves the hospitality industry soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing Food. Gelato our waitress was amamzing. Definitely a Must go to for breakfast when in Vegas"}
{"text":"Great variety of food from healthy to not so healthy. Great options and substitutions available as well as I preferred low-carb meals. It's a must try breakfast restaurant! Great staff very friendly and reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Surprised the hubby to a Vegas trip for his birthday and of course he wanted to find a steak and egg spot. Naturally we would've gone somewhere on the strip but being the yelpers we are we found this spot and content with the results. I'm such a foodie but since I'm also trying to watch my portions I was hesitant on what I would order. I ended up ordering the steak omelette (egg whites only) which came with the sauce and hash browns. Went with the bread in pot as my side bread option which was PERFECT for me since I'm watching my food portions. I enjoyed every bite of the perfectly cooked steak and the omelette was fluffy. I will say that they put a little too much cheese in it but overall great flavor. I was full and didn't even touch the hash browns but my hubby said they were yummy. He ordered the bacon wrapped tenderloin which he said was just perfect. This will be a must breakfast spot next time were in Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Really nice waitress (dressed in PJs) and good service. I ordered a short stack with bangers and my friend got the infamous chicken and waffles. Both were great and we totally finished it all. I highly recommend their pancakes--crisp around the edges, fluffy in the middle. Thin but not too thing. Their bangers were delish too, I'm pretty sure they were in a natural casing. The chicken was tender and spiced just right.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"- excellent place to stop for breakfast if you are passing through Vegas 
- located off the strip so easily accessible without dealing with any of the madness of LV Blvd 
- freshly made OJ
- I ordered the chilaquiles which were delicious and a great value at $10.95
- ample variety of hot sauces available at every table including chipotle cholula.
- charming PJ style waiter / waitress apparel 
- very friendly and competent service staff

Came back again on our way to Lake Powell.  This place is 3 for 3.  Tried a three item omelette (avocado, cheddar and jalapeño) with the toast and hash browns.  Was delicious; huge portion could not finish.  Manuel ordered the bone in ham steak which was massive and very good.  Keep up the great work team."}
{"text":"Wonderful new breakfast place! My boyfriend and I stopped in today for a bite to eat. The environment is warm and friendly (with lots of windows). Felt good inside. The woman who waited on us, Maria, was kind and knowledgeable with the menu. I ordered the cinnamon crunch french toast w/ sliced bananas. It was amazing! He ordered an omelet with chicken & avocado. Also very good. We will definitely be coming again."}
{"text":"The food is super good and the place is very original. The servers wear pjs because that's part of the Rise and Shine ambiance."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place negative stars because I would!! We waited for over 15 minutes then left, but before that we where never asked if we wanted something to drink or even greeted by a server,  horrible customer service, what makes it even worse is they weren't even busy. I would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"While in Vegas, I was laying in bed from a night of drinking, searching Yelp for breakfast options and stumbled upon Rise & Shine. Immediately, from the combination of pictures and stellar reviews, I knew we HAD to have breakfast there before we left town. I ordered the chicken and waffles, the bf ordered the steak and eggs benedict, the nephew ordered the red velvet pancakes, and the FIL ordered some thing that I cannot remember for the life of me. They all knocked it out of the park!! The chicken and waffles is a must try!! I recommend everyone ordering something different and sharing because there are sooo many good things to try. 

First of all, the portion are enormous. Which is wonderful because the food is so stinking good. Which is bad because if you have little to no self control like me, you cannot stop eating! Ahhh!!!

Tips: order the pot of bread. Cutest little cinnamon roll I have ever seen. Also, get there early. They are busy, so expect a wait. But let me tell you-- it is WELL worth it."}
{"text":"This is the second time my daughter and I have been to this restaurant and both experiences have been great. The food is good but the service is phenomenal! I love food but I'm a stickler for service. I don't care how great the food is if the service sucks I will not be going back! This place by far exceeded my standards of service , Emily and Riley rock! 

They were very accommodating to my picky style of ordering and very patient with my 7 year old daughter, I always let her order for herself....

This place gets 2 thumbs up from me! We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"It was good but nothing to write home about.  I gave it 3 stars because everyone was very nice and they asked us to write a yelp review."}
{"text":"I use to go to the southern highlands location, then the summerlin location. lucky for me this location is a 5 minute walk. Easily one of the best chicken fried steaks you can get anywhere in this country. Been all over the south but this place does the steak right. The gravy is sometimes a little hit or miss. but always good enough to make this one of my favorite meals."}
{"text":"On this visit I came alone and a bit later than I would have liked. There is no denying that the food is great... but I am back to concerned about the service. My waitress who I have had several times was awesome. But the bar was empty,  several empty tables and I was told a 10 to 15 minute wait. It took the hostess a very long time to seat the empty tables and my wait was closer to 25 mins... bar was still empty when she took me there. I was served quickly. However the plate looked like a train wreck. No grapes as I have come to expect here, they obviously haven't scrubbed the grill between orders as there was much grainy char on the plate. The servers seem to use the bar area to drop stuff on (menus, unwanted table items etc) and the buckets that have silverware and napkins at the back of the bar had a layer of dust on the back edge. Seems like a loss of revenue to not have the bar full of payomg customers instead of empty and full of mislaid items. My suggestion... either a) assign a waitress to the bar that can handle it and a table or two or b) maybe get a bus boy or hostess who is maybe interested in becoming a server to take just the bar. You lost 4 tables of 2 to 3 people while I waited and probably more as I ate. Again food is really tasty but the inconsistencies will lose customers.  Cary runs her butt off to make sure customers are taken care of."}
{"text":"First time here and was disappointed! One of my daughter lives near this shopping center and suggested this place. My other daughter and I we're on our way out and wanted something quick and togo. I ordered a burrito which they customized since there was only about 3 or4 items for there burrito selection. Also asked to cut burrito in half and they said they couldn't do it since it would fall apart. Not true, for what I had asked for I know for a fact  it would not! A $14.50 burrito, bacon, hash browns,eggs and cheese. Had maybe 2 small stripes of bacon, very very small amount of hash browns. Tasted more like an egg burrito. Maybe they don't specialize in burritos but quality should be in all there items. Again very disappointed"}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly staff. Good service. Moderate prices. Great local spot."}
{"text":"Super yummy and they are willing to personalize their dishes for your taste. Super casual and the restaurant is really cute ! The servers also wear pajamas!:),"}
{"text":"They always have fast service and amazing food. They are always friendly and give suggestions."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles were amazing! A perfect combination of spicy, crispy battered tender chicken breast atop a hot Belgium waffle with cinnamon infused maple syrup! SO good!! And our server Laura was fantastic as always. Can't wait for their Green Valley location to open!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Our server Gilbert was very informative and helpful! We would definitely come back! The food was YUMMY GOOD!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE NEVER EVER EVER EVER DISAPPOINTS! And I'm not even a big steak eater. The atmosphere is fun and friendly. The servers wear pajamas and it's super cute! The food is delicious. Definitely get \"The Ultimate,\" it's a ribeye with two eggs, hash browns and your choice of bread. I come to this spot every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I have to say I love this place...breakfast is always wonderful...and best part is everyone is so friendly. I had breakfast here this morning and had to sit outside cause I had my pup...and I have to say they were accommodating to us...and even brought out water for my pup....and even with sitting outside they still took care of us promptly.  We will be here all the time"}
{"text":"Love the friendly service and the relax feel of the restaurant. Food is great, my husband and I got back all the time!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken and waffles, probably one of the better ones in town. The pot-of-bread was tasty but it picked up a clay-ish flavor from the pot. The bread itself was very good. The french press coffee was outstanding and reasonably priced. For the chicken n waffles, they used a chicken breast that is scalloped meaning, cut in half but still connected which gave it some size and helped it cook quicker. It was crispy and well cooked. The waffle was nice but kinda soft, and that is something common for most the waffles in town. I like the  crispy style waffles at Bread and Butter or Bouchon. But solid place"}
{"text":"Spinning umbrellas hanging from the ceiling, servers in real out of bed PJ's, hip gourmet chef.... yeah, just your typical suburb local mom and pop place!

\"Like say what?\" It's all true. The food is GREAT, but they serve it with a lot of SWAG. Go, let all your senses be awed in an Alice in Wonderland like way. Only in Vegas my friend, only in Vegas. 

Thumbs way up, but as always let me know what you think.

{"text":"Awesome food, good people. Love steak and egg. Steak and omelet is awesome with the sauce on the side. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The food and service are great. The food took a while to come out, other than that it was great.... will be back agai n"}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! The service was one of the worst ...our server 
brought out toast 20 minutes before our meals.....We where a party of 6, she brought out 3 breakfasts 10 minutes later 2 more and a few later mine..... but yet I counted 16 employees they have more employees than customers no excuse.... the food was greasy and the Chicken fried steak was spicy hot ,the only thing we liked was the cup-of-bread . The glasses were they serve the fresh juices were dirty . July1st at 1:40
Don't know servers name they don't wear name tags."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I was at the tale-end of a weekend in Vegas, but this was not the best way to cap off the trip.  It has \"Steak & Egg\" in the title, I so of course I got steak and eggs (specifically, the bacon wrapped tenderloin steak).  The bacon was very fatty, the steak was dry.  It came with an open-faced omelet which had way too much mustard on it (why put mustard on an omelet anyway?).  

We also got the pot of bread, which was a gimmicky idea, but not really that special in the end.

The service was very nice and friendly (which is why I'm giving this place a 3 rather than a 2), but I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"This breakfast place is so cute! The inside has a broken mosaic tile look and flower umbrellas flipped upside down as lights. Such a cozy and warm feeling for breakfast. And the servers wear PJs! :)

No, I didn't get steak & eggs. But I did get a breakfast platter with pot of bread. Pot of bread is like a dinner roll and a cinnamon roll mixed in one. It basically tasted like bread with some cinnamon... It wasn't AS exciting as I thought it was going to be, but the presentation still gets a 5 star rating from me. The hashbrowns were thick cut and so tasty! The bacon was done perfect and they use real eggs! 

I was very impressed with this cute breakfast spot and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The servings are huge. Prices are little high, but you can feed two people with one dish if you like, so that helps. Service is really good. Last time we were there they had changed their menu and added way too many things, keep it short and simple I say. Worth checking out for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! All I can say. For sure try their \"bread in a cup\". I will always make this a stop on my way out of Vegas. Love the staff wearing pj's."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in July and twice in August.  I love this place because of the food.  The place is a descent size, cleanliness is average, but the food is awesome and the people are great, and that is good enough for me.  Price is average, not too steep.  Love the ceiling decor, great location, tons of parking.  My favorite brekkie place in VEGAS."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast stop. The wait can be annoying but it's popular so what can ya do. I order the Salmon Benedict it's my fave. Oh and I gotta have my orange juice maybe a coffee. The waiters wear pajamas there and I don't know why I don't either??"}
{"text":"This is the best place for breakfast. They get pretty busy because they are good at what they do, so expect that. But overall everything is killer. If you read any other reviews that contrary to that, they're crazy. These guys really have hit a homerun especially thriving in a strip mall plaza style.  I try to eat here at least a few times a month. Everything is good. Great choices for kids, like silver dollar pancakes (with chocolate chips!)"}
{"text":"Though there isn't many choices, this place does not need a ton of entrees to be a great place for breakfast/brunch. 

The food was really tasty and flavorful. I never expected it to taste so good! I ordered the Homemade Cornbeef & Hash with eggs with the Pot Bread, my other half ordered the Buffalo Chicken Breast with Eggs and Hash browns and a side of Pot Bread, and then we had a side of the Original Pancakes. 

The corn beef hash was different from what most places offer, and was not heavy or bland. The dish was light and included a perfect amount and my eggs were cooked exactly as I had ordered. 

My other half's plate, the Buffalo Chicken... Was excellent. The checkin breast was super moist, easy to cut (even with a fork), tender, juicy and definitely delicious. Side note, the buffalo sauce that's drenched on the chicken is a bit spicy but it does add a great kick to the chicken. The hash browns were great as well. 

The pancakes, so soft and not mushy. 

The pot bread was very light and not too sweet. Best dipped in the sauce that accompanies the dish. 

I definitely recommend coming here if you want something a little different than your usual breakfast place."}
{"text":"Really a 2.5 but always round up to benefit business. I called this morning to place an order for pick up, while taking my order, the lady seemed very distracted and kept making me repeat the order. She told me the order would be ready in 15-20 minutes. I arrived after 15 minutes and waited another 15 minutes. This doesn't bother me so much if they are making the food fresh BUT it does bother me when they forget items. If you need 30 minutes, you better take one extra minute and double check the order to make sure it's correct. 1st, we ordered original eggs Benedict and they forgot the hollandaise sauce. This makes the dish what it is!!! 2nd, we ordered an omelette with toast, but there was NO toast. How do you forget something so easy. 3rd, we ordered a yogurt parfait that included NO granola. 

The sad part about this, is the food was delicious. It's a shame that a business makes such dumb mistakes when it shouldn't be. Luckily for them, the food was good enough that I will try them again, but not take out.  I will adjust my review then if deserving."}
{"text":"I gave this place 3 stars because of the host. The food is excellent and the waitress is great, but the host was very rude. There's no word to explain how rude this lady was. It made the whole experience of eating here a very bad one. It's too bad because I did like to come here to eat but I won't be back"}
{"text":"Gonna be coming here again next time we're in town for sure!!! Pancakes were nice and fluffy. Chicken fried steak had a nice thin crunchy batter! And our server Laura was super sweet! Nice little set up inside and the servers and in pajamas... loved it!"}
{"text":"We love the decor of the place; it's bright and cheery.  Love that the servers wear flannel pajamas.  The restaurant is clean and so are the restrooms.  The servers were friendly.

We were worried about the size of the pancakes so our server let us know we could get a half order.  That's great because we didn't even finish the half order!  I had the banana pecan and Frosted Flakes pancakes and hubby had the regular old fashion pancakes with a side of scrambled eggs and bacon.  I really enjoyed the combination of bananas, Frosted Flakes and pecans and the fact that they serve warm maple syrup.  The issue for both of us is that the pancakes were dry/overcooked.  Now that's better than being undercooked as extra syrup can help with a dry pancake.  The eggs were overcooked as well.  Bacon was good.  

We got the French press which was pretty good.  It was a dark medium roast.  

We would come again if we're in the area because based on the reviews, we suspect the chef just had an off day."}
{"text":"I hate writing a bad review because this place is consistently good, and because I myself work in the food and beverage industry. Unfortunately today we had a bad experience. We ordered to go over the phone. It was a corned beef hash, a salmon Benedict, and a bagel with cream cheese for my mother. So, now we're home with our food and the bagel we paid for isn't there. I guess that's our fault for not checking the bag. The corned beef hash is fine. The salmon Benedict is bad. Not that any particular ingredient is, just the dish as a whole was bad. I Never send food back but had I been in the restaurant I would have asked to change my meal. So I sit at home now with a dish I cannot eat and my mom doesn't have her breakfast. I guess we will just get dressed and go out to eat something :("}
{"text":"Been to this spot twice and will be regulars soon enough!

Food is great, atmosphere and location is great, and you won't find another place like it in town. The servers dress in pajamas, which makes you feel relaxed. Each time I've come to eat here, my friends and I go in our pajamas as well. They fit groups of two to eight and more if needed. I've ordered the chicken and waffles, the french toast, the hash browns, and omelets, and everything is exactly what you expect it to be and then some. Food comes out fresh and hot, they work well with substituting items, the french press coffee is a must, and their prices reflect the quality of food.

First time I went there, it was with my boyfriend and we just wanted a nice breakfast spot nearby. We yelped this location, and gave it a try. We were greeted at the door, and were sat immediately. The place wasn't that busy a little after noon. The server was friendly and knowledgable. She explained certain items on the menu that we weren't familiar with, and gave our order. They brought us complimentary fresh cinnamon bread in clay flower pots that were amazing, and we ended up ordering another, which was a mistake because when our food came out, the portions were huge. We were so full, everything tasted wonderful, and the server didn't bother us too much but checked on us often enough. She gave us our check, and we paid when we were ready to leave. Between the two of us, the bill came out to about $30 not including tip. Which I think is fair for the amount and quality of food we had.

I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Get some grub. They do get busy at times. Feel a part of the family and fill you stomachs. Nuff sed!"}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise. We had breakfast on our way out of Vegas, away from the strip and its traffic. Awesome food quality, quick service, and all our dishes tasted exceptionally well. We ordered:
Red velvet chocolate chip packages - super chocolatey and yummy 
Chicken Avocado egg white omelette - Excellent 
Fancy steak omelette - Amazing 

All egg sides and kids' dishes were excellent as well. Even the Cappuccino was a high quality taste. 

Definitely, this place is going to be a staple to our future Vegas trips."}
{"text":"This is the go-to breakfast spot for my BF and me.  Conveniently located right down the street from his house, yummy food, and waitresses in PJ's make it worth the sometimes short-ish wait.  I'd for sure give it 5 stars, but I sometimes want a bloody mary or mimosa with my breakfast....especially on an early morning, after a late night...but alas. There is no booze to be had.  The coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice has to get me by, and they do so pretty well, being super delish.  Service is always awesome. Sometimes I think I'll wear my jammies to fit in, but I always forget.  Next time!"}
{"text":"I don't hate it but I don't love it. Their coffee is awesome, and they have a French press as well that can be done at the table, it's amazing.  Their juice is fresh squeezed and brought promptly to the table. They have this bread in a pot.  So good! I HAVE to have one every time I go! Now the bad stuff... Occasionally my steak is over cooked and it doesn't taste right, and personally I don't like sending things back.  We did that once and didn't see it for another 15-20 min.  By then our whole party was done.  It has its good days and bad days but the good overweigh the bad.  Definitely worth a try, but at least you get a heads up."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Food sucks. Service sucks. Drove all the way from aria for breakfast and I had to wait 35 mins for egg whites and avocados. Could have gotten a better deal at Mcdonald's which I should have gone in the 1st place. Horrible."}
{"text":"Let me just say the food is amazing and portions are plentiful! My waitress today was the best i may have ever had. I like my coffee to stay hot and am normally let down with slow refills but I had to tell her no thank you a couple times which totally impressed me!
  On the negative, I was seated at the bar and for the entire 45 minutes I had to look at two of the three chefs inappropriate and disgusting attire. One cook was young with a backwards skater hat on with pants halfway down his backside showing off his grey underwear while wearing a short tee shirt. The main chef was older in what looked like his 40's and was even worse. Biker bandana, biker chain to wallet, short shirt, and pants that were BELOW halfway down his backside with all to see his black boxers with gold designs on them??? Are we supposed to be impressed by his \"ganstaness\" or disgusted? Why do I pay good money to eat great food and have to look at two cooks butts the entire meal? Looks like there's no overseeing by management to prevent such a business mishaps. If you go to eat and want to enjoy your food without seeing someone's backside the entire meal, DON'T sit at the bar!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat..  Friendly staff, need a bigger place!!  It is so beautiful and calming in their."}
{"text":"Yet another great breakfast here. Got the Banger Sausage omelette with the requisite Pot Of Bread. Amazing service and quality!"}
{"text":"The ultimate place for comfort food, especially when nursing a hangover or leaving Las Vegas. Off the beaten path but not inconveniently located far off the 15. Worth it.  Come here. Excellent service, very reasonable prices. Oh, and bring your jammies. Totally okay here."}
{"text":"Ordered the Three Little Pigs bagel sandwich. It was delicious! The service was...eh. Saw our waitress once ten minutes after we'd sat down, for a quick \"Everything okay?\" right after someone else had helped us & brought our food, & another time to bring the check. Had to ask a bust guy for a refill & some napkins. Then again I only saw 3-4 waitresses with a full house & a 10 minute wait.
Did see/hear our waitress do some weird stuff at the next table. She literally picked up their kid to get him off the booth that was about to fall apart & also blew raspberries over their table before a laugh. Probably a bit of spit..it sounded gross.
Anyway, good food, eh service. Maybe catch them at a better time than a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Everything was so good!!  The pot of bread is delicious.  Red velvet pancakes, steak and eggs, French Toast, and Chicken and Egg White Omelet were all really good.  Service was actually really great.  We had to send a dish back and she was so nice about it."}
{"text":"This place is expensive, but they have excellent service with very good food and generous portions. The drip coffee was good as was my build your own omelette. The hash browns were excellent as was the gravy for my biscuit. My spousal unit had a ham steak with her meal and the ham was very tender, and tasty. The waitresses wearing pajamas, my wife thought the concept was really cute and unique(yes they were all decent pj's), the wife loved it! And her and my sons pancakes were light and very tasty & the syrup was piping hot-yummy!!"}
{"text":"This is a good breakfast/brunch restaurant. I've been here numerous times and have been happy each time. 

Ive had the 3 little pigs Bagel sandwich that was delicious, it had plenty of ham and bacon. 

My favorite is the steak chilaquiles.  OMG, this is yummy. Tortilla chips are just right, nice and crisp. Not soggy at all. Just enough toppings. The steak comes on the side. The steak is good by it self but I personally cut about half of it and put the steak pieces over the chilaquiles. I would say I've had it about 3 times and each time is just as good. 

Each I've been there the service has been pretty quick and the people working there have been nice. The staff wears pjs which is kind of cool. I do have to agree with another reviewer that the fans should be dusted but its not a deal breaker for me (:"}
{"text":"So,  after having gone to Rise & Shine at least a dozen times and introducing many friends,  I will no longer be returning. I ate there a few days ago and saw that they had knocked out a wall and expanded. I thought, oh good for them, because they are always busy. Then I started looking through the menu and realized it had changed, but not for the better. The prices of everything had gone up and toast or a pot of bread that was included with dishes before,  was no longer. I ordered a chicken and waffle which I've had a couple times before. The other times, the chicken,  which is always huge,  sat atop thick waffle...not this time. The waffle was thin as a pancake and had not been poured with enough batter to be whole. Our server took our order and brought us the check, but nothing in between. The thing that got to me the most about the whole visit was the fact that this place has had loyal patrons in the community and then they jack up the prices & give you less, like they are on the strip serving tourists. Way to ruin a good thing."}
{"text":"Came here this morning with my office , and let me just say from the service to the food it was great , Ryley was so nice ! We will definitely be coming back :) !!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome! The service is great and the food is amazing with generous portions. Definitely a go-to spot for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"How can I start with greatness and delight in the morning?  Let's go to Rise and Shine in the Southern Highlands Marketplace! 

The wait was a short 10 min followed by overly cheerful pajama wearing ladies that would be a colorful start to any day. It was for us. 

Sat down and was immediately greeted by our bubbly waitress and my husband and I knew from the menu description that we wanted to share an omelette and picked the FANCY Steakhouse Omelette packed with juicy steak, mushrooms, onion, cheese, spinach and bearnaise. Can we just say ABSOLUTELY YUM!!

Besides the pot of bread (extra yum) and the potatoes filled with onions (that were perfect)...Rise and Shine is the place to be. They do serve breakfast as well as lunch. Simply Wonderful!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Our server was not though. I've been to multiple breakfast places in Vegas and to me, service is everything. Go for the food but be aware of the server who acts like she's on something. You don't refill coffee and pour it on place settings without even apologizing or replacing them. You shouldn't let guests wait 5-7 mins for their check. Last, if you help a guest switch a meal, switch the price. Don't wait till after the guest has paid only for him to realize he was charged extra. The restaurant shouldn't be charging for something a guest didn't eat even eat in the first place."}
{"text":"First, this used to be the our favorite breakfast place. Since they opened their other location this one has gone down the drain. The service is super slow, the food is subpar and the people managing do not have a clue. We ordered our food at 10:57 and by 11:57 we still didn't have our food."}
{"text":"I just happened to be on this side of town running errands and the group was getting hungry.  Not wanting to hit any of mainstream eat spots in the area, we basically stumbled onto this place.

Upon entering Rise & Shine, one might think they have stepped through the looking glass.  There are upside down daisy light and daisy fans.  The windows are surrounded by mosaic tiles.  The smell of sweet cinnamon lays heavy in the air.

Everyone from the manager to our waitress, April were unbelievably pleasant.

The menu though basic in it's appearance contains some very interesting items.  Some of which we were able to sample today and look forward to sampling some others in the future.

The meals consisted of a Steak Benedict served on your choice of a plain or everything bagel.  Another plate of goodness was the French Toast coated with Cinnamon Crunch.  It normally comes on a raisin bread but we opted for Crunch coated Texas Toast...Awesome!

My only negative remark was that the poached egg on the Benedict was was not runny.  I addressed this with both the Manager and the Waitress who apologized and offered to make it right.  I chose not to make a big deal out of it and continued eating.  The steak by the way was Awesome!

I highly recommend the \"Bread Pot\" it was absolutely delicious and a fine addition to what ever you might order.

This is indeed a classy breakfast joint that I would not mind in the future making the drive to all they while passing about a dozen \"greasy spoons\" to get to."}
{"text":"Nasty cook.
I have eaten here before and have always liked the food.
Today I decided to bring m daughter for brunch. 
The issues started with the waitress scratching her head and then making our toast.
Then as I was about to put food in my mouth I cought the cook wipping his nose with the back of his hand and instead of washing his hands, he continued making the food.
I was unable to eat and my stomach turned sour.
Spoke to the manager and she then decided to tell me they have had this issue with the cook before, that really makes me wonder as to why continue to have this person around."}
{"text":"The negative aspects:

The food is bad. I ordered their ultimate steak and eggs. This place is named for their steak and eggs, so I was expecting to have a stellar breakfast before my drive back to LA. What I got were disgusting eggs, a very low quality cut of meat, and hash browns that looked and tasted like badly cooked shredded potatoes with a bunch of oil splattered on them.
I brought it to the attention of the waitress, who in turn brought it up to the manager. The manager spoke with me, insisting that they only buy the best type of meat. I knew better, as I've had steak and eggs in many different places throughout LA and SD. The only thing that tasted right was the toast, but it's pretty hard to screw that one up.

The positive aspects:

The customer service was on point. I was seated immediately, and the staff was very nice. And by nice, I mean they greeted me very warmly, and even expressed sympathy that I was not happy with the meal. I've seriously never been greeted this warmly by any restaurant staff member, so props to them.

Seeing as this was a one time occurrence, I will consider coming back here and trying out other dishes. Stay tuned for updates."}
{"text":"My husband choose this place for breakfast and I am a very happy girl, service was excellent and the food is good!! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Steak is fantastic. Definitely get this with the pot o' read. Pancakes are fluffy and airy. Good portions"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place while in Vegas, very cute and comfortable. The staff wears pjs so you don't feel underdressed when rolling out of bed to get some steak and eggs."}
{"text":"It was good. Felt the price point is a touch high. Can get just as good of breakfast for less at several places close by. The balsamic glaze that is on the Ham & Eggs Benedict ruined it I felt. I love balsamic & put it on many things but what they used had a bite to it like pepper. Back of my throat burned after a couple of bites & throughout the meal.  Service was great from the waiter but the busboy that kept trying to take our plates that contained food & we were still eating which was annoying. Giving it 3 stars as there are other items on the menu I wouldn't mind trying & over all experience was ok."}
{"text":"I have only been to Rise & Shine once before. My boyfriend and I went here for brunch yesterday, and our experience was lovely!

I thought since it was a Sunday, there would be a whole lot more people, but we surprisingly got seated right away. We looked through pictures on their Yelp before we got here, so we already knew what to order.

I got the Fancy Steakhouse Omelette while my boyfriend got the Ultimate Steak & Eggs! Both came with a side of hash browns and your choice of pot of bread, toast or biscuit. Of course, we chose the pot of bread and as expected, it tasted heavenly! I could honestly keep eating their pot of bread forever!

As for our main meal, it definitely did not disappoint. I loved my omelette along with the strips of steaks on top; it was just a great combination overall! The only thing I would suggest is for them to go easy on the pepper.

Our server and the rest of their staff were very friendly. I'm actually jealous that their servers get to wear pajamas to work, so lucky! Anyway, I would highly recommend this place to everyone and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing!  The table next ours was left with food and paper all over the floor for the entire time we were there to look at, until I mention it!
The ribeye steak was over cooked and tortilla chips on the breakfast menu with eggs was overwhelming so many chips and where very hard and hard to eat!
Would not go back!"}
{"text":"A Great Morning Spot! Great service from Amber & Ryley, both were very attentive and helpful! Food came out fast and correct!! Presentation was excellent as well! Delicious food at a decent price."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today. Friendly staff. Servers all wear pajamas, which I thought was an amazing touch. Was told I had to try the \"Cup of bread\" and our server was nice enough to surprise us with a complimentary dose of the sweet cinnamon favorite. It was pretty darn good. I love bagel sandwiches and my husband can never turn down chilliquiles, so when our waitress recommended the two, we instantly knew what to order. 
He had the Steak and Chilliquiles and his steak was cooked as asked. I had the AvoVeggie Bagel Sandwich with fries. The shoe string fries were well seasoned and delicious! My only complaint was that the big selling point for me was fresh mashed avocado on my bagel... and instead it was not fresh, but more like whipped and browning... the flavor was a bit old and masked the flavor of the entire sandwich. I did try a bite of my husband's Chilliquiles and that ranchero flavor was grand! We shared a French Press Coffee that averaged a little over 3 cups of coffee. The decor of the restaurant was very bright and fun. I think we will try this place again, but will stay away from the avocado."}
{"text":"We didn't get the memo but apparently you can come in your PJs! Pajama party coming soon!

It is a fairly large and colorful place with upside down umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. Although a pretty atmosphere there is definitely nothing stuffy about this place with all the staff in their pajamas going around serving coffee like you never left your house. 

They have an extensive menu selections so good thingd our waitress was really patient while we made our selections! We split the Fried Chicken Breast and Waffles and The Ultimate Steak and Eggs Plate, with the potted bread accompanied with some fresh squeezed orange juice and delicious coffee.  Two xx large chicken breast  was juicy and well-seasoned along with the crispy, light waffle which we drizzled with their cinnamon infused syrup. The ribeye was cooked perfect medium rare as requested, and the hash browns were to dance for. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. 

The potted bread was the only item left to sample but came until the end which actually worked out great since it comes with a cream cheese glaze we treated this as dessert"}
{"text":"The server was the best part of our meal. She was very friendly and helpful!  We ordered the chiliquilles and the eggs and corn beef hash.  The chiliquilles are basically a small doll up of vegetarian beans (which I had to dig for) and two eggs with a plate of cheese nachos for $10.95 and the hash was basically 3 eggs over a little bit of corn beef mixed into shoe string potatoes($12.95) and then I asked for jalapeños on the side. Which when we got to the front to pay the cashier said your check is wrong because  the jalapeños we're not on your check. And added $1.00.  So basically 2 breakfast with water to drink was $25.50. I think for what you got here that was steep. But no need to go back and find out."}
{"text":"Going out for Breakfast can be hit or miss. This place has consistently been AMAZING!  The staff are extremely friendly and the service is top notch.  Their quirky takes on dishes such as Eggs Benedict and Chicken and Waffles are incredible. They offer Illy brand coffee which tasted great and even have a French Press if you're into something a little stronger. 

If you are looking for a great, relaxed, delicious Southern Highlands Breakfast spot then look no further."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch today with my fiancé. We sat down was asked what we wanted to drink. I ordered the chicken fried steak and she ordered the salmon Benny. When the food came I seriously thought the chicken fried steak was going to be dry but I was wrong. My fiancé's food was good too. Our waiter was very attentive and was always checking on us. I like this location better than the southern highlands location."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years and was the worst experience.  The place was filthy.  The customer service was lacking and the food was plain.  What happened?  The hostess asked how was my breakfast and was told the truth but she just said sorry.  Rise and shine,  victims of your own success, will never go back. Bummer."}
{"text":"Looks like they expanded!  doesn't help much though! Waited for a little over an hour only to find out that the girl that took our names didn't actually write our names down! (The really nice waitress sat us down, no questions asked)  Lol the food is ABSOLUTELY amazing... But the front of the house... Tsk. Tsk. Every single time we come. BUT  the back of the house is quick & efficient and the food is, once again, AMAZING. If the food wasn't so good I definitely wouldn't even bother coming ever again."}
{"text":"Cool and casual vibe with the servers dressed in pajamas. Food was excellent. Ambiance is okay and service seemed perfect overall except for our server who may have been a little annoyed about having to work during 4th of July  weekend. Steak was super tender and I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"We came back here because we loved the food the first time around. Unfortunately our second experience included an array of issues that really weren't handled with the appropriate level of care from the staff. Our waitress, when taking our orders, did not write any of it down. There were 4 people in our party and we had a good amount of substitutions/additions to our orders. When she quickly repeated our order back to us before putting it in, she made atleast two mistakes. Not surprising, our food arrived and 3/4 people's orders were wrong in some type of way. They were corrected in a relatively timely fashion besides one friend who waited too long for her order to be corrected. Throughout the order corrections, the waitress did not express any sort of apologies to us. Good food, but a poor experience due to how the staff handled our orders."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. We went there for lunch. The food was delicious. I had the best Tuna sandwhich of my life! Hubby ordered steak and was pretty happy with it as he is usually picky with steaks. The servers were in their PJ's, not sure if it's their standard dressing or just for the weekend. Very nice servers, super friendly. And the deco was so creative, they have umbrellas hanging of the ceiling which look like big sunflowers. Price is ok, it's not too cheap and not to expensive. I would go again."}
{"text":"Visiting friends in vegas from Sydney, and have been blown away by the service and food here.  Have been back multiple times and tried various omelettes and other sweet breakfast items and would highly recommend this place ^_^"}
{"text":"Love every bite! Chicken and waffles melt in your mouth and they even keep the maple syrup warm for you! Hash brown are so tasty!!! You gotta go!"}
{"text":"Been here three times. First time was perfect. Our server was fast and effecient. Food was hot and delicious. The last two visits have been mediocre. Todays visit specifically was the worst. It wasn't nearly as busy as we have seen but we still had to wait to be sat when the host could've easily put some pep in his step to get us sat sooner. Once he was done forcing small talk in the patrons who were paying he sat us and the waitress who we've had previously  (and was fine) didn't acknowledge us just keep looking extremely busy. I don't mind waiting but at least touch the table so it is not awkward when you finally do stroll up and act like we were just sat and hadn't been waiting for an extreme amount of time. 

Now for the food part....each time I have tried something different. This time the steak was over done and the bermais (sp) sauce was sour. The woman next to me ordered the same thing and got salsa with her steak omelet and I am not saying it is the waitresses fault but I would've enjoyed it with mine but its my fault for not paying attention. My husband's chicken fried steak was burnt. Everything else like i said previously was just mediocre. 

All in all good place. Just inconsistent."}
{"text":"Breakfast is hard to screw up but also hard to make really great.  Rise and shine has done just that.  Taken breakfast to a whole new level.  
Steak and eggs seems to be their signature dish and it is excellent.  The steak is as well done as the eggs and the hash potatoes are like nothing else you have ever had.
Even their bread choices are a step above the average breakfast place.  You can get a special bread they make in house that is soft, gooey and filled with cinnamon goodness.
You must eat here.  You must eat here every chance you get.
Also... Great service!"}
{"text":"Worth the 8 minute detour from the interstate of you are looking for a brunch time meal away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip.

There is something about places that beg me to leave a good review on Yelp!. Bus boys wear t-shirts that say \"Help us...Yelp! us.\" A sign hangs in the window advertising that people like them on Yelp!. Then,  at the end of your meal,  a 20 question survey is handed to you with another Help Us,  Yelp! us advertisement.  I don't need your constant reminders to leave a good review, just quality service and great food. Also,  if you want me to leave a review,  provide me with free wifi since your network shows up as the strongest of the many networks in the area (3 of which are free).

That said,  we received quality service and great food.  My fiancé and I shared their Country fried steak and eggs,  hashbrowns, biscuit,  and a side of corn beef hash. The steak was prepared in a great batter;  very crispy,  not hard,  thick,  but not overwhelming.  Gravy was served on the side and was very tasty.  Hash Browns are more like a mix between hash browns and home fries... home fried hash browns, maybe? The fluffy and crispy biscuit came out late,  but it was topped with sausage gravy at no charge... nice! Also,  the corned beef hash was a very good addition to this meal. We left very full and ready for a nap,  to bad we have a 4.5 hour drive ahead of us. 

The food was matched with great service from the time we signed in to paying the bill.  Good job,  now lose the Help Us, Yelp! Us shirts, it's tacky and unnecessary given the quality food and service you have. You'd receive 5 stars if you didn't have the Yelp! requests everywhere."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot, came here for the ribeye steak and was not disappointed med rare as ordered. The french press coffee is absolutely superb and theres no shortage of breakfast items should you choose to eat something other than steak and eggs. Our server Ashley was great. Only note I have is that I had to fetch our utensils as they were not provided at the time of our seating. Other than that had a great experience! The cup of bread is delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place to have wonderful meal. Went with my family and everything we ordered was delicious. The pot of bread is a fun little starter. I ordered the ultimate steak and eggs and it was cooked just the way I asked for it (medium rare... Yum) the chicken and chorizo burrito is huge, but taste great. If u are not a fan of spice be careful, it's loaded with Jalapeños. we did get a kick out of the waitresses wearing PJ's. All the staff was very friendly. The one thing I did find quite funny was the POS system that was mounted on the wall... It's mounted so awkwardly high.! Hahahah"}
{"text":"A friend from our church (The Rock A Christian Church) recommended this place and he highly recommended the fried chicken and waffles. The first chance I got, my brother-in-law and I both order the chicken and waffles. Let me tell ya...It's REALLY (No! It's REALLY Good.) The spice in the batter and the tender chicken breast (boneless) on top of melting butter and old fashion maple syrup and powdered sugar...It's heaven with every bite.  The chicken breast covered the entire waffle, so every bite you take has a piece of chicken and a piece of waffle. It's uber good stuff! And the portions were massive. I should have cut the portion in half and saved it for later. Because when I finished the entire plate, I was feeling the food coma effect. To top it off, our server Christine from Chicago was amazing. She was fun loving and had a great sense of humor. By the way, don't let their dress code (PJ) fool ya, they are very professional and serious about what they serve. I will definitely return here for another fix of Chicken and waffles and maybe try something else too. If you are in the area, you gotta stop by and try it."}
{"text":"Stupendous!!!

Great referral from friends knowing my quest to find the best corn beef hash. I was a little skeptical but was nicely surprised.  It was a great experience. 

Such a fun place away from the crowded strip.
The restaurant was clean and playfully decorated. At first glance the menu is a little overwhelming but with excellent instruction from a pajama wearing waitress I was able to find what I wanted. This place has a little bit of everything including it's very own juice bar. 

The homemade corn beef hash was fresh and very tasty. It was served with cubed hash and three well prepared over easy eggs. In lieu of my normal side of toast I opted for a cinnamon roll called \"Cup 'o Bread\". Very creative presentation. It was served in a cuye coffee cup and packed full of flavor."}
{"text":"Was in the smiths parking lot and saw the simple stand sign for some steaks and eggs and thought I would give it a try. Well let's just say I wasn't disaapinted. 

First thing i noticed was the cool apparel they were selling which was comical. The waiting staff was dressed in their PJ's,  which I think is great. The place was very clean and the staff was friendly. 

Now I went to a steak and egg place so I had to try their specialty which is their ribeye steak and eggs. I have to tell you it was really good, I got my steak medium rare and it tasted amazing. Then you couple it with eggs and hashbrowns, you just can't go wrong. Their Hash browns were very good and different bc they don't season them like a typical breakfast joint does and you can tell they are made with care. 

The other interesting food item that came with my meal that they are known for is their \"cup o bread.\" It's like a mini cinabun with a cream syrup that's like a sweet and salty combo that is amazing, it's a must item. 

Their omelets are amazing as well, from the ones they have on the menu to your own custom creation. All in all the menu is great bc they have a little bit of everything that they make very well. 

Oh yeah and when you go ask to sit in MARIA'S section, she is extremely nice and very friendly."}
{"text":"Rise & Shine! It's Breakfast Time!

You can't help but notice the adorable decor immediately when you walk in.  The colorful umbrellas hanging from the ceiling and the pj wearing waitresses give it such a fun vibe.  We were greeted and seated with our waitress over in a flash.  She was friendly and attentive.  My coffee was always full of their wonderful Lavazza.  Mmmmm. Coffee.

I felt I was a broken record always ordering the same thing.  So to change it up, Blueberry Pancakes it is!  Was it a good choice?  Absolutely.  The blueberries were sweet and abundant.   The pancakes were thick and huge.  I couldn't finish but about half of my plate.  They had a light dusting of powdered sugar with a dollop of whip cream on top.  My husband happily ate the cream for me.  I realize it is a steak & egg place but their pancakes are just as good.  

My better half ordered the Grilled Steak & Chorizo Burrito.  Of course I had to try a bite.  It was really stuffed full of ingredients.  Along with the grilled onions, beans, egg and chorizo~ the jalapeños gave it a nice kick.  I love spicy so it works for me.   

They have so much more on the menu that I would love to try.  Thanks for great start to my day!"}
{"text":"Decor is one of a kind just like the server attire
Food is on point... Cooked in just the right amount of time. Coffee is great.. Staff friendly. In a location you wouldn't expect to find. All in all it's great. Definitely give the place a shot, it'll impress.
The country fried steak is wonderful"}
{"text":"Over priced place. Food is mediocre. Servers wear pjs which Is cute I guess. Some waitresses really look like they just rolled out of bed though."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd review I've given to this cute and charming hideaway, and they certainly deserve it!  

Their food is fantastic!!! I love the presentation, wait staff, hostesses, and their little clay pot of cinnamon bread is mouth watering! The last time I posted, the new girl Shannon has now settled right in, and we love her! 

I would like to post a photo of one of my breakfast platters on here, but not sure how. The portions are generous, food is fresh, and their coffee is the bomb!!  

When I see someone who writes a negative review for something so little like they had to \"wait\" oh my, have you ever been to Hash House A Go-Go? I mean come on folks, that's the reason why people wait because it's that freakin good! What what the heck do people expect? Restaurants have bad days once in a while too, sometimes things don't go perfect everyday, and NO, the breakfast doesn't come on a silver platter for all you snobs out there! This is the real deal, real food, real people, and it's a 10 Spot!! Just sayin... : )"}
{"text":"My husband and I came to this place with some friends because of the great Yelp reviews, but we were very disappointed. We came for brunch and asked to be seated at the barstools (since we wanted to get in and out fairly quickly) and one of the hostesses Kelly denied us and said it would be a 30 min wait. We proceeded to wait 45 minutes to an hour and nobody was ever seated in the barstools. There was an empty table for 15 minutes and we still had to wait to be seated (we needed up sitting there. Why we couldn't be seated earlier? I have no idea). All of the hostesses were rude and looked like they hated their job. The only saving grace was our extremely sweet waitress and the food, minus my husband's French fries which tasted very old. On our way out there was a couple who asked how long the wait was and the hostess responded 30-35 minutes, even though there were 5 empty tables. I would not suggest this place unless you have some time to spare. Also beware of the rude staff."}
{"text":"Food was good service was OK definitely took to long to address people at the door along with food being delivered ordered a smoothie that took eight minutes when It came out it was Runny, very average at best and way too expensive"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast. As usual the food was excellent. Filling   Although this establishment always shows live for the military.  We were surprised to find that a special consideration was bestowed upon us for Veterans Day.  Love the food will definitely make this a favorite breakfast stop"}
{"text":"ambiance//****
what cute decor! this upside down dangling & swirling umbrellas from the high ceilings transform the place! there's also outdoor seating available to enjoy the nevada heat

everyone works in jammies~~ as in the server uniforms are pajamas! except for the one kid that wore a \"YELP US!\" shirt ;p

service//*****
arriving at the end of first seating for breakfast, we had the luxury of eating at our own pace! the line was LOOOOOONG by the time we left; early bird gets the worm!

our server was this lovely lady that kept checking on us and brought us some biscuits to compensate the for \"pot of bread\" not being available when we ordered
then she brought us another round of \"pot of bread\" once it became available!

food//****
everyone seemed to enjoy their orders
eggs benedict 
steak & eggs
eggs & pancake

and my CHICKEN & WAFFLES! =9
deliciousness! i normally don't like white meat but they fry it well!
PLUS their maple syrup is legit, as in the maple stick is no joke
be careful because the WHOLE GLASS bottle is hot syrup

and what about that pot of bread? it's a cinnamon bread served within a cup
while the concept is cute, it's a bit dry for my taste
~*~
if you're in vegas and don't mind going off the beaten path for some normal breakfast at normal prices, this is your stop!"}
{"text":"A little bit out of the way but worth the drive.  Slight wait due to the cozy size.  Phenomenal servers dressed in pajamas; awesome French Pressed coffee and the food exceeded expectations.  Bucket list material!"}
{"text":"New fan. Visited twice. 

First visit, Rise and Shine Chilaquiles, portion is enough for two to share. Taste wise, the tortillas kind of tasted like I was eating Doritos, so if you're into that..and we tried the Crunchy Cinnamon French Toast, LOVED. Also, their syrup with a cinnamon stick in the bottle is awesome as well. 

Second visit, California Bagel Sandwich, delish! Again huge meal. I only ate half. OH and those hash browns, sooo good. And we also got the Crunchy Cinnamon French Toast again. 

Fast service even with how busy they get during \"prime\" breakfast hours. I know it's kind of strange, but the freshly squeezed orange juice is my absolute favorite part of my meal here, ha!"}
{"text":"I have visited this business twice and I must say I really do owe them a review. 
Is it about the fact that the servers all dress in their pajamas and looked so homely or that the food is amazing. Oh wait did I mention that it's gigantic too. It's fairly pricey for someone like me but it's worth every cent. The omelet plate comes decorated with orange slices just for fun. The juices are bomb with a slice of fruit of whatever juice you ordered hanging on the side. 
I love that they don't bother you while you dining by asking every second \"are you okay?\" Just because there is a line (unlike most places I have been). Eat your fill and take the rest to go. There's no contending that I won't be visiting again"}
{"text":"I am so happy that a valet guy from the M hotel in Vegas told me about this great place to eat had a orange and carrot  juice so yummy and the best chilaquiles and steak that I  ever had I am definitely coming back next time. When I came to Vegas again I am my family I am a picky eater so that's why I loved this establishment thanks everyone you are doing a awesome job keep it up"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  We ordered the New York Steak Benedict Bagel and the Crunchy Raisin French Toast. What an amazing breakfast. It was delicious! We also had the pressed coffee pot and we were coffee buzzed all day! Go check this place out. It's awesome. They even have cute umbrellas hanging from the ceiling and the servers are wearing pajamas! So adorable!!"}
{"text":"Every time we go its around 1-2pm, and although we love the food the service is below par.  We always have to ask for refills and then wait an undertermined amount of time before we get them, and remind our waitress of any condiments that we have requested."}
{"text":"GREAT food and service! This was off the trail from Vegas to pahrump and totally worth it."}
{"text":"We tried the iced coffees, bananas Frosted Flakes pancakes, Chillaquilles, the Go Go juice and turkey Kielbasa & eggs & everything was super delicious"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and everything about this place was unique and charming! Staff dresses in pajamas and are super friendly and enthusiastic! 

The ambience and decor is so cute and colorful. 

The food was wonderful - their signature pot of bread and ultimate steak and eggs were delicious! I also loved the hazelnut Nutella coffee - I personally liked the latte better than the cappuccino but that's because it was sweeter. The cappuccino was stronger and more coffee flavored. 

Definitely a gem in vegas and will be going back!"}
{"text":"Love it here !! You guys are excellent with service ! Extremely friendly, feels like home !! 
Everyone keeps a smile on their face and that's what I love to see !"}
{"text":"I have a feeling I'll become a regular since I can walk here for breakfast.  Located on the corner of Paseo & Valley Verde, it's convenient and easy to find.  

Like their other locations, the cute decor is complete with open umbrellas on the ceiling and wait staff in their jammies.  It's fun and creates a comfortable setting for dining patrons.  

Now since it's still fairly new to the area, weekends can get very busy.  But if you have time during the week, you can get a seat immediately.  The hostess staff have all been very quick to greet and get you seated.  The wait staff have also been the same.  The servers I've had have been friendly and attentive.  

When I find something I enjoy, I stick with it.  That's why I've had the 3 Little Pigs Bagel a few times. It's definitely a large breakfast sandwich piled with bacon, ham, banger, egg and cheese.  Some of the meats have a distinct smokey flavor that soars.  When you put this on their 'Everything' bagel, it's a complete package.  I've split this sandwich with someone and still walked away full.  Shoestring fries accompany the bagel but you can always get hash browns if you prefer.  

I'm happy to have such a close breakfast place.  See you again soon!"}
{"text":"I live nearby so this is becoming a regular breakfast spot for me. My go to is the avocado cheddar egg & veggie bagel sandwich. It's huge and filling.

Today, Monday 5/28, Maria was my wonderful server. I was greeted immediately, my food came out super fast, my coffee stayed full, and I was even offered a coffee to go. Not much more I can ask for when eating breakfast."}
{"text":"Not sure why breakfast restaurants are always chaotic. Probably a combination of hungry hungover adults and hungry little wild children. This place is no exception. The check out is in the front door walkway. Kind of bazaar. This place is always extremely busy. It's very easy to get stuck and lost at the entrance."}
{"text":"Very cute breakfast place. Amazing food!

I'm sitting here drafting this review as I watch my son finishing our breakfast. It makes me a bit sad that this place is so far from my home. I drove here from Henderson, its located on Southern Highlands Pkwy & Cactus. If it was close, I'd be the Duchess...fast! And weigh much more, probably...

I was a waitress back in the day at locally owned restaurants like Rise & Shine, and as I giggle watching these ladies serve food dressed in flannel pajamas, all I wondered was \"Why didn't I work at a place where pjs were the uniform?!?!\" How much more comfortable can you make it, right?! So you can imagine, it definitely has a warm feeling. The smell of French toast and coffee and cinnamon gets your nose up as you walk in the door. 

The menu - you can order your standards. Omelets, pancakes, bacon & eggs. Then you see Crunch Cinnamon Raisin French Toast and Spiced Rubbed Rib Eye Chilaquiles, Fried Chicken and Waffles, and homemade Corned Beef Hash. 

What else? Most egg plates come with your choice of toast, biscuit, or the ever popular pot of bread. Very adorable little round loaf of slightly cinnamon gooey deliciousness seem to be on many tables during my visits. 

The drinks - freshly squeezed orange juice is always a favorite of mine I share with my son. But I had to try their French press coffee after reading about it. A generous serving is brought to your table, accompanied by a sand hourglass, with three separate colored sands. You decide which sand to follow to determine how strong you want your coffee. Love it!! (see photo if you can't picture what I'm saying)

I haven't dined here for lunch, but I slightly glanced at it while drooling over the breakfast choices. If you're not in the mood for breakfast, like their current special, Baked Blueberry Pecan French Toast Casserole or my personal favorite, Make-Your-Own Yogurt Parfait, you can choose from burgers, salads, panini sandwiches, and daily specials like meatloaf, fish & chips, and chicken broccoli pot pie, served until they run out. They also offer a few kid's plates, however, if you have a toddler like me, the generous portions they serve is more than enough to share! Prices are decent, the service I've received have been warm, inviting, and prompt. 

I think if the next few visits are as awesome as my previous ones, they definitely warrant a 5-star review. For now, it is far to drive to, and I do wish they offered lighter healthier options, too. Do I end up ordering them? Not much. But I like having the choice when I'm feeling weight-conscious on those rare occasions. Nonetheless, I'm a big fan of Rise & Shine's yummy breakfasts!"}
{"text":"This place is friggin AMAZING!!!!!! I've been back a few times over the past few weeks cuz everything on their menu is super fire!! The spice rubbed steak & chilaquiles is by far my favorite. Get the pot of bread w/ that (and ask for a side of the cream cheese sauce if you're feelin kinky)! #cinnabunstatus!! The vibe in the restaurant is pretty dope too. The servers rock their jammie's & are super friendly. If ya got a hankering for some killer steak & eggs, this is a no brainer!!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years. Although the food is good, the service has gotten worse and worse :( 
I had to ask the server to pick up our food that had been sitting in the window, after she delivered it she never returned to our table. And it wasn't busy. I got my own to-go box and as we paid at the front I wanted to express how bad the service was, but the woman who rang our check was rude and didn't get eye contact with us once. No smile No thank you, nothing. So sad to see a great place go down hill"}
{"text":"Good breakfast.  I have been a few times and the space is nice, the pj's are cute and the food is good. It isn't my favorite breakfast place, but a good option. My only issue is it seems they are always a little unprepared. I have gone on weekdays and there are seats open but we have to wait for them to clean off the tables. Like they were short a staff member.  

On another note the white chocolate coffee is DELICIOUS! !"}
{"text":"Ex and I went Dicing 2 Eat (Dice Living).     I chose the restaurant because I had heard that they wear their Pajamas when serving and it sounded neat.    I was right!    They do and it is neat!

Once there we were seated in the nearest booth to the door because I walk on a cane from a broken ankle I sustained in December, no fun!    but that was very nice of the waitress to do for me.

The restaurant was clean and surprisingly empty-very few people were there and i had heard to come early and be prepared to stand in line so that made me wonder....

I had to try an item off the menu from a section chosen by The Die.   ~The Classics done better~ was chosen for me and then my Ex Don got to choose an item for me to try from that section (want to go Dicing with us yet?    we need a 3rd  :D )    Chilaquiles was chosen for me (that may be the incorrect spelling though)   It was basically fried Tortilla chips covered with Refried beans, cheese, sour cream, salsa, avocado and topped with 2 eggs.   YUM!!    

I chose the section for my partner and I chose beverages and then I was to choose his item and chose a Mocha Iced Coffee.   He did not like it, he said it was watery and weak, I decided to order the Vanilla Mocha and had the same results and we love Iced coffee, Ihop seems to make the best from what we have had so far and this is the ONLY reason I have to give this place a 4 instead of a 5 star review.

The service was excellent and because I told the waitress that we were new, she brought me a Pot O Bread for Free, its a cinnamon roll in a cup served with a kind of sweet and not sweet dipping sauce-It was excellent.

Highly recommend this place!       They even have spinning umbrella lamps!       We will be going back next time The Dice chooses it of course!"}
{"text":"Oh my deliciousness!  We happened upon this little gem on the way to LA.  The steak was cooked to perfection, cup of bread was a sweet little taste of a yeasty cinnamon roll with a yummy dipping sauce.   Serve was AwSoME!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best breakfast place I've visited since moving to Las Vegas. If you enjoy a good breakfast, it's worth dropping in. If you're not in the southern Highlands area, it's worth the drive. 
Ambience: this is a smaller restaurant, which gives a great feel for breakfast. The wait staff is in pajamas, which is a nice touch. If you make a trip alone, I recommend sitting at the bar and watching the cooks work. These guys are on top of their game  
Food: the portions are big! You definitely get your money's worth. As far as taste, the food is flawless. The pancakes are perfectly fluffy. I had one of the bagel sandwiches and I was thoroughly impressed. 
Staff: everyone from the hostess to the manager is very friendly. The waitresses are very attentive and are always around, but not in an annoying bothersome way. 

Overall, a great little restaurant. I will be back many times for sure."}
{"text":"Yum! I believe this place has been around for awhile and I've been meaning to try it. So glad I did. I LOVE breakfast but it's hard for me to enjoy at most places because I don't eat beef or pork. Despite the fact that they are a \"steak n eggs\" place, this place has more then a few options for people like me. Although not very healthy, I love their chicken and waffles.... The portion size is large but it is great to take to go for a later day snack. I am also a huge fan of the fact that they serve coffee in a French press which is my absolute FAV way to enjoy some joe. The only complaint I have is that they do seem to run out of things frequently. Especially the infamous pot of bread. Other then that, service is always fast and friendly. Food is good. Wait is never as outrageous as some places (but we don't go on Sat). Nice job Rise and Shine."}
{"text":"Love the chilaquiles from here! I've always had a good experience when I've dined in. It does tend to get busy in the mornings (like all breakfast places), but the wait is worth it. Portions are pretty large, too -- I usually end up splitting an entree with the hubby and that's plenty for the two of us."}
{"text":"Alright place for a steak and eggs breakfast. The steak that I got wasn't the best cut, it was full of fat and eggs were bit overcooked. I'll definitely try to place out again to see if it was fluke or not. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"As a frequent visitor of Las Vegas, I don't know how I could've possibly missed this super awesome and delicious eatery!!

My friends and I had arrived into Las Vegas, and I just just arrived from New York, while my friends were recovering from a long night, and we were clueless as to where to go for some good lunch/breakfast.  We yelped on our phones, and when we came across chicken and waffles, we thought well, could they possibly be better than Roscoes?  Well, let me tell you...

The Staff & Service

Impeccable, supremely dedicated to customers, and so friendly, I thought I was in another planet!  Seriously, everyone's smiling, and so welcoming.  Customer service is super important to me because I work in this field, and when I don't receive supreme customer service, I ain't happy!! We didn't know what to order, so we asked the nice waitress, and with her recommendations, my friends and I ordered our dishes.  She gave us enough time to order, and she was spot on with her recommendations.  To summarize this area, the word to be used is: perfect!

Rating:  5 out of 5

The Food

My friend and I ordered the original Chicken & Waffles.  Let me tell you...it's far better than Roscoe's.  The fried chicken wasn't dry--just perfect and crispy.  The waffle was delicious--no flaws for sure.  The portions were just about right--I was super hungry so I ate it all.

My other friend ordered the Rib-Eyed Chilaquiles.  The steak was juicy, and the chips that were layered beneath the steak was to die for. 

The \"pot of bread\" was a first for me.  It was delicious--not too sweet like cinnamon buns, but just perfect.

Overall

I will most definitely be returning to this restaurant from now on, every time I visit Las Vegas.  This would be place for me to get a hearty breakfast without a doubt.

Rise and Shine: If y'all are reading this, thank you for your awesome and delicious meal!  You guys are awesome!!"}
{"text":"I've been here only once but my first impression of this place - I love it already. One of my top favorite breakfast places in town now. I've been wanting to try this place out for like six years and FINALLY just got to try it today. I wish I tried it sooner ! There was no wait when we came in this morning too.

They have an extensive menu and everything sounded so good for breakfast but I finally settled with their crunchy cinnamon french toast. They have the BEST french toast in town ! And I'm not just saying that because I came in starving lol. I really enjoyed their variation of french toast. It wasn't too sweet either. It's a must try. I also ordered my french toast w/ egg whites and turkey sausage and my friend shared some of his hash browns. Loved every single part of my meal. One of their other highlights is their pot of bread. Presentation is cute , it comes in a small mug. It's like a cinnamon roll and you dip it into their cream cheese icing (or whatever the deliciousness is). It's also served w/ butter on the side but it's that good on it's own so it doesn't need it. 

Love the theme they got going on too - they have twirling flower umbrellas on the ceiling and all the servers wore PJs. I would love to come back here again if it wasn't so far from my house. If they could open another location in Henderson that would be perfect :)"}
{"text":"Here visiting Vegas and steak and eggs sounded good so we tried this place out...SOOO glad we did!!! It's delicious, made from scratch goodness. It changed my life, it was that good!! Order the ultimate steak and eggs or the chicken and waffles, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the food, 1 star for the coffee 

This is an above average breakfast spot. I highly recommend trying their fresh-squeezed OJ and an omelette or the banana pancakes (although the pancake batter is noticeably sweeter than other breakfast spots). 

My only complaint is the coffee! The regular coffee is weak, and the french press is barely drinkable. I always order OJ and then go to Starbucks after (located in the same plaza) for my coffee fix. Several other locals I've talked to do the same."}
{"text":"Best breakfast diner in town HANDS DOWN.

Your best breakfast options are not located in the heart of Las Vegas (the strip, spring valley, etc). Rise & Shine is located on the far Southside off the 15 freeway of Silverado Ranch Blvd.

At this joint, they offer some serious quality breakfast in exceptional presentation. I have already visited this place twice in less than a week. All for good reason.

On my first visit, I tried the Ultimate steak & eggs breakfast which consisted of a massive and juicy 8oz rib eye steak. Along with my meat was hash browns and 3 egg whites. It's about $14+ but you get what you pay for. This is one massive meal and a quality that you can't find at South Point or wherever the hell you go for your midnight steak & eggs.

On my second visit, I tried the Ham & Eggs Benedict on a English bagel. Though I'm not much of a Ham & Eggs Benedict type of person, it was tasty as well! Served with your standard hash browns.

Already came here twice and looking forward to a 3rd time to see how the corned beef hash is. Apparently, it's made fresh from scratch so can't wait to give that a try.

Service was great as well! Servers were all attentive and courteous. They even wear pajamas to resemble an early-day atmosphere."}
{"text":"5 stars is not enough for this place. Food is amazing, service was excellent and a very relaxed atmosphere. Place was very busy wait was about 20 min. The eggs benedict and the kitchen and waffels were great they are a must have. If your in the south valley this is best breakfast place."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service, delicious food and great prices! Everything on the menu looked so good, I can't wait to be back in the area to eat here again! It was nice to have normal sized portions as well."}
{"text":"The service is great. Seated fast, and very happy. The coffee is great with choices vanilla and half and half. That's what we came for, then it happened. The waitress said the potted bread is good and cinnamon toast crunch French toast. We had this for two, off the hook!! I wish there was a place like this where we lived. Brads recommendation: hide the waitress Serice bar out of site. Everything else great!"}
{"text":"My first time here.  The service was great from Maria.  I had their new breakfast burrito..the green chili and pork carnita.  Very tasty...although had to much pork and not enough eggs.  Spoke to Maria about it and she let the kitchen know, so they can fix it in the future.."}
{"text":"Cute place, great food and descent prices.  I had the chicken fried steak and it was one of the best I've had in Vegas.  The pot of bread was amazing.  Staff is very friendly and place is very clean. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I live a few minutes from restaurant so is convenient but it's really overpriced. The food doesn't impress me but we usually meet with family so it makes it better I guess. Last time I went the workers were not having a good day. There's no manager walking around to make sure everything is fine.  Based on last time I went I will not be going back at least for a long time. Hopefully they improve their food and service. I don't mind paying more for good taste and great service. Good luck if you like your steak medium rare.  I like their fresh juices."}
{"text":"Can it get any more fun? Staff serves in their p.j's. Decor is a blast and menu is endless. You like it, they make it.
Best of all... A+ RATING WITH HEALTH DPT!!!
must go to place!"}
{"text":"Just go to Rise and Shine, you'll give it 5 stars too! Great service, quaint environment, and delicious food. Beware this little cafe is a hot spot for Sunday breakfast and brunch so plan accordingly. Well worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"You just lost a regular customer. Come every week. Bring every visitor I have. Came today with my dog, on a gorgeous 70 degree day,  but today I am informed  you aren't serving outside. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Huuuge selection! I've been here a few times and I've always had a great experience. Ashley took great care of us, she was super sweet and down to earth. I love that they all wear PJs! How cute is that?

I got the salmon and bacon bagel ~~yummy  and my bf got an omelette and hashbrown~~yummy.. you really can't go wrong with anything on their menu here."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever. Service, decor all A+
Highly recommend 
Steak was killer (ultimate)
$$"}
{"text":"We went on Friday Memorial Day weekend 2017. Went in at 10:30 sit down didn't get our food till like 11:45am. Le They were really backed up on the kitchen. It's a cute place but we waited a long time for our food. The service people were wearing PJs as uniforms. Food was tasty but I would go back another time. I got the all white omelet with chicken, spinach, cheese, mushroom."}
{"text":"Omg!  What a gem!  We found this place on our way out of Vegas. It will be one of our usual places now that we've found it. It was very cute with the wait staff wearing pjs.  They have several types of Benedicts, yogurt parfaits, and do many other dishes. Everything was delicious!  I had an avocado Benedict which was amazing. My husband ordered the buffalo chicken breakfast that was fabulous. Can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"A good thing, just got better! Rise & Shine has expanded in more ways than one. The original restaurant in Southern Highlands was recently remodeled and not only seats more folks, but it now features a specialty juice bar/latte station. No need to stop my Starbucks before entering here. Additionally, a second store is now open in Summerlin; although, I have yet to visit. What can I say, I like to stick close to home in the mornings."}
{"text":"Great service, we got our food quicker than expected, the only downside was what my friend ordered. She ordered a corned beef hash, but there wasn't really enough corned beef on her plate, it was mostly potatoes. She was upset to be eating eggs and potatoes on a \"corned beef hash\" plate. That's alright, we'll try other things on the menu next time!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: We walked in and were immediately seated by the very friendly host. My husband and I both immediately loved the decor and the color scheme. We especially appreciated that it didn't smell rank and was nice and clean. My 2 year old did his part to rest the patience is staff by throwing his silver dollar pancakes and breaking the plate. The server assured us that it was ok and without our asking, brought us a fresh serving in a kid friendly dish. 

Food:  I had the Ultimate Steak and Eggs. My husband had waffles. Everything was seasoned to perfection, tender, fresh, and wrapped in the taste of home. The Green Go Go fresh juice drink was delicious and didn't taste like grass like one would assume. Don't visit Vegas without leaving the strip to visit Rise and Shine!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and boy was it good. Our waitress was Maria. She was nice and super helpful. I wanted to order the sourdough hamburger which isn't available until 11:30am according to the menu. But Maria said she could ask the cook and he happily made the burger for me. Yum!! It was cooked to perfection and very flavorful. It came with seasoned fries and they were tasty too. My boyfriend ordered the Ribeye steak and eggs and he ate every bite. My Mom isn't a very big eater and they have a menu for kids and seniors which has smaller portions. She had the grilled cheese with fruit and ate the whole thing. We all had the best food and excellent service. Even though it was busy here she still made us feel very welcomed and satisfied. I recommend Rise and Shine for delicious food and Maria will take great care of you."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Nice pleasant atmosphere and friendly staff. If I could give it more stars I would. The best steak and eggs/chiliquiles ever.. I mean come on a rib for the steak!! The whole meal was awesome!! Can't wait to go back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING FOOD AND SERVICE!! Great friendly neighborhood restaurant! Everything is yummy!! The ambiance is geat with jammies and hanging umbrellas. Potatoes are amazing with a hint of rosemary. The french toast- and I would recommend the addicting crunchy selection is always served with whipped butter and a bottle of warm syrup! The pot of bread with a touch of cinnamon is is offered with a spot of jam and whipped butter. A wonderful selection on their menu. They always wish to have your feedback for any improvement and the owner comes around to talk and ensure it is a pleasurable experience. Very personable. This is my first review and I eat out for almost every meal. Worth the time.. Hope you enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service!  Maria is a wonderful server, and the food is excellent every time we eat here!  My favorite place to eat breakfast in the Valley!"}
{"text":"I want to pick zero stars, but yelp made me pick something. 

Went to breakfast this morning and I thought I saw something in the kitchen....sure enough, the bread was FULL of mold. Told a worker and they were mortified. I'm sure they were very sorry, but my question  is this.....with all the people working there, how come NONE OF THEM SAW IT? Why isnt the kitchen staff aware of the food they are serving? Was a nice place to go to, but knowing they are serving up any old thing, won't go any more!"}
{"text":"The food was good, (i had the egg white and chicken omelette. So fresh and delicious!) and the only reason this place didn't get one star.

The wait was \"15 min\" when we got there and we weren't seated for 30 min. The hostess was rude, but the waitress was lovely.

Unfortunately the food came out veryyy slowly and the place was not \"packed full\" to support how slow the food came out.

To top off the \"ambiance,\" the restroom was a mess (there was no hand towels or toilet paper.. But that's not the end of the world).

Lastly, there was a lot of tension between all of the employees (especially the hostess and the wait staff). It was very unprofessional, and if I was the owner I would be embarrassed that the negativity is so strong that it bleeds to the customers' experience.

I may order take out from this place some day because again, the food was great, but I do not want to be around the employees."}
{"text":"Today was my wife and I first time, and boy did we enjoy ourselves. The food was amazing the the service was even better. Ashley was amazing and she actually made conversation which we both love since are both in the same industry. My steak and eggs were amazing and cooked perfectly and my wifes country fried steak and eggs was amazing too. Lots of flavor and cooked just right. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  My husband loved his pancakes.  The coffee was exceptional."}
{"text":"May just be the best breakfast place in vegas! Highly recommend the chicken and waffles. Chicken was perfectly crisp on the outside, and juicy on the inside. Waffles may just give roscoe's a run for their money. Don't forget the little pot of bread! Baked fresh, and super scrumptious. We did have to wait for around 25-30 min, but it was during the weekend, so I bet most breakfast places would have been busy anyways. Would definitely come back again! :)"}
{"text":"So disappointed. Horrible service and the glasses were extremely dirty asked for new ones and the second time around the glasses were even dirtier and this with food stains. Can't even imagine how that kitchen looks"}
{"text":"Went a group of 11 for breakfast. Every member happy + service great prices reasonable. Would return."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, servers in pajamas and cute decor. The service was great and the syrup pourer was drip less. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this new location since hubby and I enjoy their Southern Highlands location.  Was very disappointed here.  Cold, hard biscuits, thin, lukewarm gravy.  Hash browns overwhelmed with green onion.  We spent $40 for breakfast for two and felt ripped off.  Avoid."}
{"text":"Wanted to find a nice, quiet breakfast house off the strip. We found Rise and Shine purely by accident but we were impressed as soon as we walked in. Bright, cheery and clean. We were sorted very fast and had our coffee immediately. Our waiter was Gilbert in his cute checker board jammies who was always willing to make our meal a success. Very attentive and obviously has many years of experience. Food....OMGOSH! You don't need to add salt, pepper, ketchup or anything. All the food has good flavor. We will definitely hit this establishment again the next time we're in Vegas"}
{"text":"Cutest little breakfast spot EVER!  Servers wear PJ's - all were friendly and welcoming. 

Came in around 9:30 on a Saturday morning and had to wait about 15 minutes - Grab a Vegas & Seven magazine next to the hostess stand to pass the time. This place is worth the wait!

I opted for the Pot of Bread, the omelet and hashbrowns.  

Pot of Bread - excellent, medium sized with the perfect amount of cinnamon twist.  

Omelet - My go to is usually egg whites with spinach & onions - I saw kielbasa for an option and my polish heart just couldn't resist.  Perfectly cooked & great portion sizes.

Hashbrowns - now i am VERY particular when it comes to my hashbrowns - I despise breakfast potatoes & am a huge fan of crispy.  These hashbrowns were not your normal thick breakfast has browns, but instead thin and crispy.  Probably the best hashbrowns I have ever had.  

All & all i will be adding this to my list of favorites.  Very nice to actually sit, eat and visit in a home-cooked setting.  Not in a casino - not in a bar, but in a great neighborhood."}
{"text":"I found this place by accident when leaving Vegas with the hubby.  I searched and search and drive the 20 off the strip to eat here twice. This has to be one of the best places to eat in Vegas for breakfast. Pot of bread is great. Plus 13.95 for rib eye chilaquilas!!!! Love it also cinnamon toast crunch French toast.  Both worth braking paleo"}
{"text":"I went on sunday and it was crazy!  I sat at the bar so i could see the cooks and man are they efficient!  Chicken and waffles are to die for.  This place is a well oiled machine. Good food, good service, i will definitely be back.."}
{"text":"Great food at a decent price but I did not feel like our waittress was very good. My table had empty drinks and for some reason she was outside the restuarant for a while. I plan on going back may have just been a fluke or she was having a bad day, which is understandable."}
{"text":"We just moved into the area & this has now become our regular breakfast spot. Their french press coffee & pot of bread is a must to start out your day. Their omelette is my usual go to because their ingredients are so fresh. You really can tell the difference. Texas toast French toast is excellent & their original pancakes are my step daughters favorite. They serve them with warm maple syrup with a cinnamon stick steeping in it. There is a large outdoor patio & inside seating. The prices are a little high for breakfast but the quality of the food is worth it. Oh yea you can go in your pjs bc the servers are in theirs too."}
{"text":"Great little joint. For a holiday weekend and only having one server for the entire restaurant she did a great job. Poor management for only scheduling only 1 until 830."}
{"text":"Red Velvet Pancakes with Cream Cheese syrup matched with ribeye steak chilaquilles and filet mignon bagel sandwiches all done to perfect flavor.  That's just the food.  The servers are amazing, the environment friendly and the menu diverse. What more can you ask for with a local family style breakfast/lunch diner.    (try the pot of bread)."}
{"text":"Its a really busy place which is good because the food is awesome! Big portions and great service. Definitely coming back. The red velvet pancakes were oh so goooood"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The service is great and the food is delicious. I had the Chilaquiles, which truly exceeded my expectations. My mom used to make the dish for me as a kid so I am really happy to find a place that makes them and they're tasty!! 

I can't wait to go back and try new stuff!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with G/F after I got off shift. Very festive inside, we were greeted at the front door by the hostess and was sat immediately.(Since we were the first customers of the day). Server was very friendly but kind of slow on the service side. I ordered the country fried steak and eggs and g/f got 8oz ribeye and eggs. The ribeye was very tasty along with their hashbrown, which are shoestring. The only gripe I have is that they do not put enough gravy on the plate, it comes in a separate portion cup (3oz i believe) I like my stuff smothered!!!!! Also its kind of on the expensive side."}
{"text":"Food is good, but pricey. $38 for 2 people for breakfast ! Hummmm"}
{"text":"Astonishingly amazing food, nice, quiet location, and incredibly friendly staff who go out of their way to provide exceptional service. If I ever come to Las Vegas again I will absolutely return. Exceptional!"}
{"text":"Living (trapped!) in the hospital with my son who has leukemia for the past month... he is SICK of nasty hospital food.  Finally able to eat, we Uber'd breakfast to share with my son, my husband and myself this morning.  We ordered from Rise & Shine earlier in the week and it was fantastic!  Told my husand how good they were, so we ordered again.  BUT, appears may have a consistancy problem here!  We ordered nearly $50 in food and had missing items, and no condiments.  Sadly, one of the items missing was supposed to be MY breakfast!"}
{"text":"Being a breakfast fan, this is my favorite breakfast spot ever.  Pleasant staff, dressed in pj's.  A nice touch.  A good place to take anyone.  I've been probably a dozen times and have tried something different each time and have not been disappointed once.  They also serve illy coffee which is the best.  

One very minor complaint.  Some of the booths are a little beat down and not the most comfortable.  Time for an upgrade.  The food and service make up for this though.  Not really a big deal"}
{"text":"Love the waiters in pajamas and the flowers on the ceiling. Location is convenient if you're near southern highlands and food is good. Fresh pressed juices available which is a pretty sweet touch and decent servicing sizes. Yummy options but nothing that specifically stood out. All in all a place I would stop without second thought if I'm around the area!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with my husband and Father.  Everything was so delicious.  Staff was wonderful. My Dad loved it so much that he took
My Mom there later that day."}
{"text":"Really good food service 
Very good very impressed with the whole experience
Awesome will be back very soon
Found my new normal place for breakfast"}
{"text":"Really great neighborhood spot. Cool joint good home cooking food. Just get there early to get good seating or the pot of bread \"Yum\" it gets pretty busy on the weekends! Must try plenary of options and ok price."}
{"text":"Yelp never fails to disappoint! Yelped breakfast spots and this place magically appeared! We dropped in on our way out of Vegas. I asked our waitress what she recommened and she said the chicken and waffles...I took her advice and let me tell you...IT. WAS. WORTH. IT!! My friend got the steak and bagel eggs benedict which she loved as well, but we both agreed that the chicken and waffles was AMAZEBALLS! We also got the pot of bread...which was so cute and good! Oh and the service was great...waitress was so nice! Definitely will visit this place when I'm visiting Vegas again!"}
{"text":"The reviews here seem to cover the bases pretty well, so I will only add the key points.   Foremost. this restaurant should seriously consider adding a newspaper machine outside or sell newspapers inside.  It seems like that is a must for any breakfast place.  Also, the prices are a little more expensive than I would expect, especially for a local neighborhood joint.  Overall its a good breakfast."}
{"text":"I visited for Sunday brunch and the place was slammed.  During my fifteen minute wait I watched various delicious looking meals go by, and noted the satisfied bliss of those receiving them.  I was seated at the countermand was attended to promptly my one of the many pajama clad waitresses.  My bacon wrapped pork tenderloin and egg breakfast was awesome!  I shall return to try more of their delights!"}
{"text":"A bit salty for my liking...but portions are huge and tried their chilequilles...it was good.  The pot of bread was aeesome.  The only odd experience was, our waitress served us caffeinated coffee when i specifically asked her for decaf. And the only reason we found out it was caffeinated was because I had asked for another cup since the coffee was lukewarm!! Lukewarm at 730am?! I've never been served lukewarm coffee!  When i questioned the coffee and asked her if it was decaf for sure,  she was hesitant and had to ask her manager...So this 3 star review is more for the experience with the waitress and coffee fiasco rather than the food...i will not be returning."}
{"text":"I'm just going to start off with I'm never coming here again. It's not that I had some atrocious experience, but this place just really isn't that great - especially for the price. I've had much better food at much shittier restaurants and that's saying a lot considering the value. They play country music, which to me is mind boggling since the number one response to \"what music do you listen to?\" is \"anything but country\". The service is mediocre I went an hour before closing and the server made me feel like I was inconveniencing her for having to do her job. The interior is surprisingly tawdry as well, it's like they substituted everything in a Greek restaurant for even tackier decor. Plus they sell a bunch of crap that could only be categorized as \"Things grandmas buy their nephews after going to Church but before they have brunch\". Do yourself a favor and go to Kitchen Table or Served."}
{"text":"Love this breakfast place!  It's cool that the waiter's and waitresses wear pjs to work!  I always get the eggs benedict..it has balsamic vinegar on it which is a really yummy twist to the traditional!  Hubby always gets the chicken and waffles which are great too! Service is always great!  Rise and Shine is our favorite place for breakfast when eating out!"}
{"text":"I just wish to post an update regarding my latest review which unfortunately discussed some potential health issues and shortcomings of service.  I can't update without giving a star rating.  So for now, I'll revert to my 4 star rating.

I received a personal message from the new general manager, Davilan, who was very apologetic for the shortcoming of the restaurant.  He has assured me that that level of service throughout our visit was not acceptable and not at the level expected of staff  and has been addressed accordingly.

My wife and I only expect to be treated as all the other guests, nothing more, nothing less.  

In all fairness, and based upon the very timely response from Davilan after the review posted, my wife and I will return in the near future.  I'll keep you posted."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and loved the first two times. It's a cute atmosphere and friendly staff. However, the third time they ran out of pot-of-bread, which was one of the things that made this place special. The fourth time, they had pot-of-bread but were no longer offering the awesome homemade jam that used to come with it (another thing that made them special). All in all, the food is pretty good, but nothing different from the other tons of breakfast places in Vegas. They do have warm maple syrup, but I wouldn't be surprised if they soon got rid of that too. It's the little touches that can make places like these successful, but is seems they are moving in the wrong direction.

Note to the owner(s): bring back the homemade jam!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service !
Laura took care of us and guided us through a very interesting menus with tons of variety 

Will defiantly return.
Maybe even tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Came in here on a Sunday morning for brunch. My bff Ame and I were able to walk in without any wait. This restaurant is located in Southern Highlands, a super nice, relatively new neighborhood in Vegas. 

We each ordered the short stack of pancakes platter with the choice of bacon, banger sausages (what we both got), or turkey kielbasa and two eggs. 

We decided to get a side of tomatoes to get some veggies, as well as a pot of bread to try. I also ordered a cup of coffee (they brew ILLY coffee - THE BEST!).

I had no idea what a pot of bread was, so this was the best way I could describe it: It's like a cinnamon bun, without being sweet, and served with preserves. I thought it was delicious and appreciated that it wasn't terribly sweet. Also, it comes in a little flower pot. SO adorable. 

Also, our waitress was kinda amazing. One of the nicest servers I'd ever seen in Vegas. She kinda reminded me of Shania Twain (random I know). She seriously kicked ass, and did a great job of taking care of us. 

Just a couple of minor things I would have Rise And Shine work on:
-My banger sausages (DELISH) were warm but not hot
-The prices here are a little more expensive 

A few things on my list to try next time:
-2 cup French Press Illy coffee
-Steak and Eggs -- this is their signature dish
-Hash Browns - seems like everyone had this and I had major food envy"}
{"text":"The staff was not sitting guests in hopes for the kitchen to 'catch up'.  Also, while whimsical pajamas day for the staff only remains funny when the restaurant actually has efficient service.  Don't try to be funny if you can't make your guests at least sAtisfied."}
{"text":"Really good food. Coffee presses available but poured coffee is also good. Quick service and very interesting menu."}
{"text":"not what it used to be! if your vegan they will still give you chicken and get mad when you complain about it. terrible customer service, the owners don't like to cater to \"ethnic\" people whatsoever. owners are also very rude smh"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile because it's always just been ok. It's close to us, so thought we'd try it again. Went around 10am and it was busy. They told us it was a 15 minute wait but was less than 10. We both ordered omelets which were good, not great. One was fluffy and the other was almost too done, should have a little consistency. The breakfast potatoes are bland. The pot of bread is good, cute idea. Service is really good, servers wear pj's as their uniform and are all sweet. Two omelets, a hot tea, and oj was $34 before tip, seems a little high for what it is. I'd go back but mainly for the convenience that it's so close."}
{"text":"This place is legit, if you are super hungry this is the place, food is hughe, very tasty, the service is great and right on time. Definetely a place to go and spend some time."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing here.  No wait, cute atmosphere and the prices were good.  Forget those high priced buffets when you can eat here!  Service was great!"}
{"text":"Wow.... The food here is AMAZING. I ordered the steak & chilaquiles to try it out and they give you a whole steak cooked/seasoned perfectly! Fresh watermelon& strawberry, orange, or green juice. Our waitress was really friendly as well. If you're in Vegas this is a MUST try. I look forward to coming back & im so excited I found my go to breakfast place in Vegas. You cannot beat the quality of this food."}
{"text":"Bagel with cream cheese cucumber and tomato cost me 7.50. Ridiculous pricing. Only reason it gets two stars as oppose to 1 is due to the fact the food was okay"}
{"text":"Loved the concept from the reviews and it sure was busy on a Sunday morning. The menu is interesting and the pot of bread is a winner. Perhaps didn't order the right item and if I come back may try to be more original, but the omelet was nothing special and light on filling and any type of seasoning, but the hashbrowns were so peppery that almost rendered them inedible. There were peppers in the hashbrowns but the peppery flavor was a heavy pepper shaker. The too busy atmosphere almost made the pace seem frenetic so didn't enjoy the experience that I was expecting to."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Yelped and found this gem. It's a cute little cafe with daisy umbrellas hanging down from each light fixture. Servers wear pajamas!! It was just a little hot because it's 100 degrees outside and we were sitting on the window table, and drinking strong hot coffee with my fav French vanilla creamer. 

I ordered the ham n eggs Benedict with spinach. Delicious! Hollandaise sauce was on point, better than most other breakfast places and it's also drizzled with balsamic. ;) The BF ordered the roasted turkey, bacon, egg, Swiss, tomato on an \"everything\" bagel. Wow is all I have to say!!! Super huge with lots of cheese and delicious. We will definitely be here on the regular!!"}
{"text":"We love this cute restaurant for breakfast!! The food is so good and the service is great too. Kris was our server this morning and she was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great waitress (funny, attentive, quick)

Fun atmosphere (music, temperature, vibes)

Great coffee (no nasty creamers at the table)

Amazing food (perfect steak of course, vegetarian and gluten free options, large portions)

Not too pricey.  $40 for two + tip."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite breakfast place. The only thing that I dont like is I always order medium rare steak but it ALWAYS comes in well done. French toast is great! Fresh orange juice is great!"}
{"text":"BEST STEAK AND EGGS EVERR!!!!!!
Great service, great vibe, great food!
I recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to rise and shine for about 3 years, for a while it was our Sunday breakfast spot and we would go every Sunday. We always get the same thing, country fried steak, the Texas French toast and a side of bacon. Slowly the service and \"friendly\" atmosphere turned to crabby and sloppy. I understand that breakfast places are usually packed on the weekends but that is no excuse for the lack of customer service. When I say \"thank you\" as you put down my food I don't expect a lot but maybe a \"you're welcome\". Last week we went to the newer location on Valle Verde and because the food has always been Phenomenal we will take the drive and go to that one. We will miss our regular servers but the new staff that has been hired needs to be trained in basic manners at the Southern Highlands location."}
{"text":"Service is very friendly. I had the cheesequila with steak and it was a great breakfast combo. Lots of gluten free options but still pancakes and toast if you want to have the traditional breakfast stuff."}
{"text":"It's a wonderful place! Love the food and the staff are always warm and friendly! We try and make it once a week. The portions are large and delicious. Kinda pricey but that is because SH rent is so high. Two  thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Food and service were awesome. 

French press was to die for if you need something to kick start the day. 

I ordered the chilequiles and steak. The chilequiles was topped with shredddd cheese, cheese cojito, beans and eggs. It was delicious! The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly. It was very moist and tender. My hubby ordered the chicken and waffles. It's not often that restaurants know how to properly cook fried chicken but this place made the chicken very moist with the right amount of batter. I'd also recommend ordering the pot of bread as a side. It's yummy cinnamon bread. 

Also our server was very friendly and attentive!

If you're looking for a quality restaurant I would definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"This is probably going to be my new favorite breakfast place. Absolutely amazing food, awesome service, festive atmosphere. I highly recommend the fancy steakhouse omelette and the bread in the cup."}
{"text":"The Chicken and waffles were surprisingly very good. I was against the whole chicken/waffle thing, but I finally decided to try. And I'm happy to say I was able to try them here for the first time. Theirs so many flavors while chewing it in your mouth. Well done! The coffee was also delicious. The only down fall to this place is that it's so hot inside the restaurant! I was sweating and not just because I was having a coffee, but seriously hot in there from the minute I entered."}
{"text":"Been here a few times before leaving Vegas. Very cool vibe and food has been good everytime. It is a local spot but still expect a wait if going on the weekend."}
{"text":"The food does not disappoint. The patty melt and fries with the added rosemary on the fries were delicious. The chicken and waffles were some of the best I have had and I go to roscoes chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"The smoothie and coffee bar is amazing! Very busy on weekends, but what breakfast restaurant isn't? Waiters in pj's, comfortable atmosphere and family friendly. Add great food and u got a great place. 

This is my second time here and I ordered cinnamon French toast platter with scrambled eggs and bacon. It was so good and reasonably priced. 

I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"It's good, not the greatest, but good. I wish they would do a traditional country fried steak instead of the fried NY steak that they do. The last time I went I ordered the ham steak and eggs, the ham was great, not over salty and very tasty! I asked for sunny side up eggs, when I received my plate they were sunny side up but basically cooked all the way thru with hard yolks. The breakfast gravy here is better than most places in town and the cup o bread is amazing!"}
{"text":"First I have to say I went here when it first had opened I had so much fun the food was amazing. Now a couple years later craving the food the menu is different food was good but not what it used to be didn't get greeted as I walked through the way everyone was dressed was very sloppy and not as uniformed as used to be. They over charged me for French toast you can go to Ihop for half the price. I asked if I can have blueberry French toast and the server Vanessa says \"sorry we took the off the menu\" and offers something else, comes back with the food and said \"sorry that's the best I can do for you\". Turn off right there if I could I would have walked out of that place immediately, but I didn't want to embarrass my family. Moral of the store is I will not be returning and very disappointed, because that was the place I recommended to eat."}
{"text":"food is always great and good service. perfect place to start your day...try the french press coffee!"}
{"text":"This place has never done me wrong. Staff is friendly. It's a chillax vibe with the pajamas. Good good. It's Beene great experience! I've taken my friends here and multiple occasions and always recommend getting the cup o bread no matter 

Second review! Had to just share my second experience here! This plAce is just amazing. It's high quality food and the portions are huge. It's a country fried New York steak and eggs, not that bottom round shizz. Gabe has coincidentally has been our server both times at the same table. The dude definitely puts the word shine in the restaurants name! Keep killin it Gabe"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple of times now. The food is wonderful & the ambiance it's the best. My only reservation is that the wait staff seems to run around a bit haphazardly. I will return."}
{"text":"Food in my party of 6 was okay except the homemade hash! Greasy and now appetizing. I had the specialty dish Mexican which was good, however I got something real chewy in my mouth! Plastic about 2 inches long by 1 inch wide. Must have been off the chorizo mixed in with beans, chips, eggs, avocado,  salsa, and sour cream.  They didn't charge me for it. I would go back. My group wore our pajama tops to fit right in withe wait staff. Outstanding service!!"}
{"text":"This was the best part about my brief stop in Vegas. Service - very friendly, our waitress was new but had the perfect suggestions. She also accidentally brought us a bread-cup, which was tasty (no charge). French press coffee was perfect for 2, strong flavor. The ribeye chilaquiles were outstanding!! The meat was cooked just right (med-rare), even the fat just dissolved in my mouth. The chilaquiles themselves were just crunchy enough and not soggy at all. The décor is fun and I love the fact that the servers get to wear comfy PJs and be themselves, tattoos, piercings etc just make everything more genuine."}
{"text":"First time checking this place out, I'm pleased. The food was delicious and beautifully presented! My friends loved the bacon! I loved their hash browns and pancakes! Their decor is interesting and unique. Seems like a family owned place. It took me a little while to realize that the employees wear pajamas, I think it's a cute idea! Overall, I had a perfect experience. The food, service, and atmosphere was all really great! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The best breakfast EVER!! Our new \"going home\" breakfast place:) Food was A+, Service was A+, very pleased!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place with reasonable prices. I just wish they had a changing table in bathroom."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for a while now and finally i did yesterday! People are friendly. I love the menu! They have a great selection for lunch as well! Small place, goof thing there is also out side seating. I ordered the crunchy cinnamon raisin french toast and i made it a meal, The eggs were really nice and fluffy and the sausages were nice and tender! My boyfriend raved about his ham and cheese eggs Benedict, it came with potato hash browns on the side. The hash browns were soooo good! We also ordered the pancakes , regular ones. The pancakes were super fluffy and almost melted in my mouth! Best pancakes ive tasted in a while, but it didn't beat the yummy french toast i got!! Can not wait to come back, its all ive been thinking about. Service was okay, could be better."}
{"text":"If you live in Southern Highlands, it's a great little diner to eat breakfast at. I always worked mornings, so I couldn't go as often as I liked. I just ate here this morning and it is still as great as ever! Plus, I think they extended the hours. They're open until 3pm now. The waitresses are cool. I ordered an egg-white omelet with tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, and swiss cheese. It was PERFECT! It also came with hash browns and toast. I ordered it like that, but there's loads of other choices as well. The portion was just right. I adore the spinning flower umbrellas on the ceiling, too. If you sit at the barstools you can watch them make the food. It all looked so amazing. The place is really clean and there's lots of light. If you want to see some pictures or their menu check out their website and Facebook. Definitely go here!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in Vegas so far. I have been going here for over two years. Previously was close to my place (it's just off cactus and Decatur/southern highlands parkway) but now I happily drive there. 

The wait can be long sometimes and no reservations. So go early! It is a small place. But worth a wait (never too long anyways) if you are a late-comer. 

The menu is great. Lots of options but especially great because all the food is amazing! My personal favorite is the New York steak spinach and Benedict bagel. I opt for the everything bagel. The hollandaise sauce with the balsamic flavor on top of perfectly poached eggs and fresh spinach and a steak is nothing to complain about. Their hash browns are delicious too. Shaved yet thick... And have a buttery crispness to them. Love!

They also make these little cinnamon breads in clay pots \"pot o bread\" that is wonderful. Now... This used to be more wonderful when they made homemade jam with chunks of strawberries... But it's still delicious with butter or the packaged jam. OR I have been known to get a small side of the cheesecake icing or something they have so it is cinnamon bun like :) (recommended a while back by a waitress there)

The next best thing here is their coffee. IF you're a coffee fan they have an option of French press or regular brew. I always go for the regular brew which is ILLY coffee. This is one of my fave roasts :) so I usually take a cup to go since it's hard to find in the city. 

You can tell the staff enjoy working there. I always see the same servers. Great atmosphere and great food means happy customers and happy staff :)

The next best thing would be... That mostly anything that can be split in half you can order a half order. The price is somewhat changed (half or so) and is nice because the portions can be way too big! Or in case you're split between two dishes... It isn't written on the menu BUT they are so accommodating. You'll see!!

Try it! You won't be disappointed. And IF by chance you are --- let them know and in a jiffy they will correct it... That you'll forget anything wasn't perfect and still leave there smiling!! 

My only downside would be the price.  Somehow I would like to see somewhat smaller portions and a slightly lower price. That is what makes me not go there as often. I feel breakfast should be max 10 per person. Not 15... But that would be my only complaint..

YUM! Salivating writing this... Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place. Everything is really good. I love the eggs Benedict. Everyone is super friendly and we get great service. I also love the French press coffee!"}
{"text":"Just had our first experience here and it was amazing. The carnita chilaquiles were excellent and my wife normally doesn't care for pancakes loved them. They use sweet cream pancakes instead of buttermilk and I guess that's what the difference was. Thank you Laura the recommendation and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"**Updated Review **
This was my first time back here in years, and my rating sadly has tanked. 
Came in on a Monday morning and the place was pretty empty (to be expected for a weekday). 
We sat at the counter. 
I had some questions to make a veg or vegan breakfast, and the waitress was not helpful in the least. Okay, I get it, the name may say it all..but you can be helpful ...right??? Wrong. 
I asked about the breakfast potatoes being cooked in oil or butter and she said it was butter... imitation butter. Wow, a place that charges $10-$15 per plate and you're serving fake butter? Regardless I wanted my potatoes cooked in oil. It was a no go. So I ordered a juice... sucked it down...and will not return."}
{"text":"What a find! Thank you Yelper's. Before we left our Strip hotel we wanted to find a local place on the way home. Just a couple of miles off the freeway was this gem. 

Whimsical decor and fun waitstaff. We ordered the pot of bread as recommended and were not disappointed. Just the right serving size in its little teacup. 

Someone else suggested the corned beef hash and eggs. Not my go to breakfast but I haven't had it in a long time so I gave it a try. So so good.

Our waitress Cary was delightful and attentive, always filling our glasses even half full. 

We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"1st timer, busy breakfast place in southern highlands- everything was delicious. Full coffee and juice bar. Chilequiles and chicken and waffles were delicious."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. A wide selection of food and everything is cooked to order.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Pretty Good palace . My plate was $15 . Only down fall is they charge $1 for cheese on both my eggs & hash browns  .  But they everything about the meal was really good ."}
{"text":"Crunchy French toast is amazing. I also like their green go juice. I eat here on every trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Being a huge fan of breakfast food, I wish that I could say I loved this place and that I'm excited to go back, especially since it's locally owned. But, unfortunately that isn't the case. 

he service was great. We were greeted right away and seated. Soon after someone took our drink orders [they serve illy coffee!]. Soon after, our waitress came up to see if we had any questions. 

I'm on a mission to find the best chicken fried steak in Las Vegas, so it was an easy choice when I saw it on their menu. I'll admit, once the food came out and I saw my order, I wanted to drool a little bit. It was a nice big portion of the chicken, scrambled eggs, gravy, & hash browns. 

The eggs were cooked well enough, but lacked any taste whatsoever. A little salt would've gone a long way. The hash browns seemed a little undercooked. Potato was still kind of starchy, and they were missing that nice golden brown color on top. The gravy was actually quite good, and was probably the highlight of the dish. Moving on to the main item, the steak. I liked the fact that it was a thick steak with a thin batter on it. Unlike the eggs, it did not lack in flavor whatsoever. Unfortunately, the ONLY flavor it had was of black pepper. Apparently what they lacked in salt in the eggs, they made up for with an excessive amount of black pepper on the coating of the steak and on the steak. 

One of my fellow diners ordered the chicken & waffles. His chicken had the same exact problem as my steak. All we could taste was the black pepper. It's unfortunate really, because both the chicken and steak were tender and cooked well. 

The pot of bread that came with my order was sub-par. Like the eggs, it lacked taste. I don't usually like to but butter on my rolls, but this bread definitely needed it to get some flavor. 

So, all in all - great service but lacked a bit in the food department. The food was cooked well, but needed better execution in my opinion. Hopefully, I just went on an off day. Maybe next time, if I so happen to be on that side of town during breakfast hours I might give it another chance. But it's definitely not worth another 20 minute drive for the sole purpose of eating there."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! Great food, great service and the prices are very reasonable. It's pretty cool that all the waitresses wear pajamas."}
{"text":"When you put a cold dinner roll in the microwave do you know what happens? It becomes warm and hard as a rock. It's very obvious that the few orders of cup of bread we received were reheated in the microwave. They were super dry and after about a minute or two they were hard as rocks and completely inedible. Wouldn't be such a big deal but at $3 a pop I expect something edible. Very disappointing. Everything else was fine. It's just aggravating when restaurants make poor choices in hopes to save a few cents, cuz in the end they're losing a lot more by inspiring us to find a different breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Some of our friends said this place was really good so we decided to give it a go; it also had good Yelp reviews and, being the Yelper I am, I try and put faith in my fellow Yelpians (is that what we're called?  I dunno).

Unfortunately, it was a little less than what I was hoping for.

We arrived and were seated immediately.  The restaurant was maybe half-full and it looked like most people were eating or had already finished, enjoying cups of coffee and talking amongst their parties.  We expected pretty quick, efficient service due to this, and did not receive it.  Everything was slow: ordering, getting things to our table, the check - it was really disappointing since it was obvious we missed the \"big rush.\"

The hash browns were definitely nothing to write home about and tasted starchy - I tried some of my fiancé's.  And their coffee was like watery mud oil.  I ordered a signature dish because I really like to try those from places.  So, I got the blueberry and cream cheese stuffed french toast (I believe this was the name).  It came out and was HUGE!  They definitely don't skimp on portions, hence the extra star.  When I tried it, though, it was way too processed sugary.  I picked at the blueberries and the french toast for awhile but got full super fast and ended up sharing it with the rest of the table.  French toast doesn't really make good leftovers.  Pretty sure I should have gotten a heart attack from that, but the overall taste WAS decent.  Another downer was they didn't have low-fat cream cheese as an alternative, which is probably why I felt so full so fast as well.

Overall, definitely not impressed.  Perhaps everyone else just got lucky and had better food / service than I did.  Considering the above plus the prices, I'd rather just go to IHOP."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised and happy that there is another breakfast place near my house.  The décor is very friendly and colorful which I love.  They have upside down umbrellas hanging from the ceiling which is pretty unique and indicative of a street in England.

I ordered a lot so I could try a bit of everything:  

I got the cup of bread which is essentially a cinnamon roll cooked in a coffee cup with cream cheese frosting to dip.  It was good but needed more cinnamon and I would've preferred a glaze to dip.

I got a side of biscuits and gravy which again was good but too pricey for what it was.  Also, my biscuit was hard as a rock, luckily they replaced it for free.

My main dish was the chilaquiles which was very tasty.  Chips, with ranchero sauce, cheese, refried beans, salsa, sour cream, two eggs, and avocado.  

They have so many different types of dishes, many that are not seen elsewhere that I really want to try.  Guess I'll have to go back!"}
{"text":"I think I'm going to have to drive back from LA just to come eat here!!! The chilaquiles and rib eye steak plate was AMAZING! Absolutely delicious!!! Very well priced and the staff are dressed in pj's!!! My type of place. I fit right in with my messy mom bun lol. Def going to be our go-to for breakfast when we're in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I love eating here but this time I ordered for take out. Food was ready in 15mins but everything was just so wrong. The burger I ordered was really plain, no mayo and came with onions which we did not want. The chilaquiles I ordered were okay just had to take the eggs off since they were extremely runny. Totally killed my appetite. The pot of bread was yummy as usual. Next time I'll eat there instead."}
{"text":"This is the second time at rise and shine. The first time I ordered the chilaquiles with the steak. It was different than most that I had. But still very good and a good portion. The steak had a good seasoning and was very tender. The second time I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was very very good , nice and crispy , and the waffles tasted like fluffy cake batter. It went well with the chicken. Orange juice is squeezed fresh and sweet. Not bitter at all. And you get a little pot of bread with a side of cream cheese syrup . Also very tasty! Service is good and it's adorable inside!"}
{"text":"Quick Sunday Brunch! The concept of the restaurant is cool. I really like that the waiters were in pajamas and twirling umbrellas on the ceiling. I ordered the steak and eggs medium rare with the bread in a cup. The bread in a cup was the best part for me. It was sweet and the bread soft.  Unfortunately my steak left much to desire. The steak was well done instead of medium rare. I told the waitress and they fixed it immediately. The meal for me was nothing special. My friends on the other hand enjoyed their food very much. They ordered the chicken steak and Hash. I also ordered their Kale and apple drink it was really good! I just chopped it up that I picked the wrong thing on the menu. Also their cutlery and cups were dirty. The good out weighed the bad so I will probably try it again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  they are great for both breakfast and brunch. It seems to get busy in the morning, but worth the wait.  Any time I'm in Vegas I make an excuse to swing by here now.  Nothing but good memories and great food. 

The red velvet pancakes are amazing.  Super rich and very delicious. The omelets are good too.  I recommend getting both something sweet and something savory, then sharing! 

The service here is spot on.  Very friendly and they seem to actually enjoy being there. All the servers wear pajamas. Maybe it's due to the comfort of the uniform or the people at work, but everyone there seems to really enjoy it."}
{"text":"Love this place.   GREAT breakfast.   You must try the cinnamon pot of bread...Delicious.   they are known for their steak which I believe is butchered in house.   Try the steak and eggs."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place more stars but after two mediocre experiences, I have to settle at three. Both times the food has been good (the French press coffee is very nice), it's very cute inside and I love that the staff is wearing pajamas. It's the service that has been the disappointment. This last time we got in right after they opened and had zero wait getting seated. But then we had to wait more than 40 minutes for our food (a long time with a hungry 2 year old) our server didn't even make eye contact when she was talking or supposed to be listening, we had to consistently ask for refills, toast that was supposed to come with breakfast, creamer etc. and the bathroom was in a pretty dismal state.
Also no biggie but would be nice if they would add non fat milk to the menu. 

Lastly, we went on Mother's Day and they handed out roses to every mother but me! I didn't want to ask, \"hey, can I have a flower too??\" I had the damn baby and I want my rose! ;) I'm pretty sure our waitress just wasn't paying any attention but I felt like the black sheep, ha. 
I might give it a third go to see if it's the charm but honestly, I left feeling like I'd have had a better experience at an IHOP and would have spent less."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!  We live around the corner so it's very convenient to stop by anytime.  If you come to Vegas and want to get off the strip and enjoy good atmosphere and food, check this place out!!  I would say it's more of a breakfast place but they do serve lunch as well, I have tried many items on the menu and have yet to have a bad meal!  A must have is the pot of bread, even if you order it separate, delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a Fantastic place we found by Google-ing breakfast on maps.  Such a wonderful surprise.  Stop in before 3 pm."}
{"text":"Our family is always on the hunt for great restaurants. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner places. Loved the atmosphere. When we arrived the place was packed had to wait for 20 minutes to get a table.There was three in our party and we ordered three different things so we could all sample different dishes. 
The chicken fried steak is gigantic, enough to share. The breading was awesome. Order extra gravy. 
The steak and eggs were delicious not too big or too small. The steak was very flavorful! 
The corned beef hash was good. Had better.The corned beef was diced into big pieces prefer it the traditional way.  
Wanted to try so many other dishes that sounded great. Will definetly be back!"}
{"text":"Cappuccino was okay but the steak was delicious. The ultimate ribeye steak and eggs is delicious. Service is okay."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at this  establishment and I was very pleased with the staff and the level of service. The menu could be a bit more diverse but nonetheless the food was great. I had the chicken and waffles and was blown away. The portion was huge it actually made 2 meals for me. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Customer Service=Excellent 
Food: AMAZING
Cleanliness: Flawless 
What I recommend: The red velvet chocolate chip pancake... and try the bread in the pot."}
{"text":"Without a doubt , the worst breakfast experience I have EVER had .. All started with flat Pepsi , staring at our food under the lights for 15 minutes , bringing us liquid butter,toast that could've broken a window , my wife's omelette brought 10-12 minutes after mine, and the refusal to bring the manager over, and then charging us like everything was normal.
I'll make sure that all of my friends that frequent this place are well aware of the utmost lack of compassion that was displayed today.."}
{"text":"Delicious reasonably priced food served by friendly and prompt servers in a clean and comfortable restaurant. Your breakfast/brunch/lunch experience here will be exceptional.

We stopped by on an early Sunday afternoon for some brunch. It wasn't, fortunately, very busy so we were seated quickly. I'm not sure how we missed the opening of this restaurant. We love their southwest location.

The restaurant is clean and comfortable like their other location. The servers are prompt and friendly, like their other location. Basically, another very nice Rise & Shine location.

We had the meaty egg white omelette and a bagel sandwich of some kind. Both dishes were very tasty."}
{"text":"Ok so if you go here you have to ask for Riley because her service is awesome. 
The food is absolutely amazing. Everything from scratch and just good clean food. 
The pot of bread... oh my goodness. Not overwhelmingly sweet so you can enjoy the uniqueness of the cinnamon roll baked in a espresso cup 
This is definitely my new favorite spot for breakfast when I'm in town. 
Been twice already and want to go back for more."}
{"text":"Awesome delicious food.  Vents make it a little cold.  The organic coffee was outstanding. Every plate of foods that would come out looked spectacular. Will definitely come back!  Have perfect waffles. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles and it was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The wait time to be seated is always long since the restaurant is so small but they do have good food. Southern Highlands needed a breakfast place in that shopping center and Im glad they opened it there. It beats driving all the way to go to Ihop or Dennys on Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"I've tried two Rise & Shine locations and both times I've had issues.

Southern Highlands location - Once seated, it took close to more that 15 mins to get our water,  30 mins for the server to take our order and another hour to get our food. We've seen people get seated, eat and leave while we were seated. Totally unacceptable.  We spoke with the manager but did nothing about it.

Henderson Location - Thought I'd try this new location out. I ordered for pickup. Low and behold, I had a very long piece of hair in my food. We called and spoke with the manager and requested for a refund but we needed to go back to the location. Once at the location, the manager was no where to be found.  Got the refund from the host but WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.


I DO NOT RECOMMMEND GOING TO THIS PLACE.
THIS PLACE IS A JOKE. I HAVE HAD BETTER SERVICE AT DENNY'S."}

{"text":"I tried our new breakfast place but was little  disappointed with all the high rating they have. The location was perfect, the waitress was very nice but the food was very average, you can pretty much have it any place in the city. Maybe I order the wrong thing, next time I'll have the rib eye steak with eggs, will see if this improves. The prices were 15% higher than most places."}
{"text":"WOW what a fantastic find, the food was fantastic, very fresh.  The service was top notch, thank you Riley for the wonderful dining experience.  We will definitely come back next time we are in Vegas..  #fighton"}
{"text":"The first time I had the food it was brought home to me by my husband and it was amazing. The second time we went in and ate. Let me start by saying the environment and decor is amazing. It's so cheerful and bright. I could stay there all day and be in a great mood. And yet again the food was amazing. The service was great and our waitress was so sweet. Our friends steak was over cooked the last time we got food from here so he was hesitant to come back. The waitress was so sweet about it when we told her and kept telling us if anything is ever wrong please tell us we will fix it don't worry. I would highly recommend this place. I can't wait to have family or friends visiting and bring them here."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible! Takes forever just to get seated even when there are plenty of open tables. They have 1 moron waitress wearing dirty pajamas,no busser or hostess. Food is marginal at best. They mess up the order and don't even care. And theres also some huge fat slob (I think the owner) who just sits there an eats and doesn't help seat people or do anything about the fact that te place is totally understaffed. Looking at the owner alone is enough to make someone lose their appetite. I'll never go back to this place!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place and was not disappointed.  The food was made to order perfectly, brought in a timely, friendly manner and was proportionately perfect for the price! I recommend this little place to everyone.  Great brunch menu! Awesome breakfast menu! I can't wait to try everything on the menu!  We came in at almost closing and were there up til close and we were treated with respect and kindness!  Love this place.  I wish the fancy shmancy restuaraunts were even close to the friendliness of this place! way to go! we need more here!"}
{"text":"Standard American breakfast place. Ordered the press coffee, had to return the press because it had seen better days and we we were getting grounds through the filter. Food was ok."}
{"text":"My husband and I always comes here for breakfast when we are in town we always seat by the counter and watch the cooks prepare the awesome meals. Service is excellent the staff are friendly and very attentive. Food is served large portions we always spit the Steak  and Eggs Which is perfect and delicious. Can't go to any other breakfast place except here has variety of plates to choose from the menu don't forget to try the Biscuits n Gravy and pressed coffee excellent."}
{"text":"Awesome new place for breakfast in the Southern Highlands area, we so needed this place! Amazing food.. only downside is they dont serve alcohol so no Sunday morning bloody Marys or Mimosas!!!"}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place and went a few weeks ago and was disappointed to say the least. I thought I ordered the wrong thing and tried it again today and it was worse then before. The service and environment is nice, however the food is subpar at best. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.

PS 3 hours after eating there I feel sick!"}
{"text":"Rise & Shine is a perfect breakfast spot if you want to try something outside of the high priced tourist areas of Vegas. Located in the corner of an unassuming strip mall is this high quality breakfast spot. 

While the steak and eggs is the go-to (and they sure looked delicious), we went with a normal pancakes, eggs and bacon breakfast combo. It was so large that we ended up sharing it for the two. Awesome bacon and fantastic pancakes.  For the amount of food and the price, you really can't beat it. 

Nice and quick service as well."}
{"text":"So first and foremost, I'd like to say thank god for this breakfast place in Southern Highlands. It makes my heart smile, I love breakfast and hate the drive all the way to \"The Cracked Egg\" all the way on Rainbow. So about the food......my new favorite is the stuffed blueberry french toast.....it was deliciously warm and very satisfying. You have to try that plate!! My boyfriend loved the steak and eggs, his words the steak was to die for!! I was very impressed with not only the food but the cute and quaint decor.......the hanging flowers from the ceiling was a nice touch and I have found my new found breakfast place and would recommend this one to everyone who is deciding or contemplating on coming in to try this place....not to mention the prices are perfectly priced for the food...great job!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, great service,  and amazing food!! Get the French press coffee :)"}
{"text":"omg..the best breakfast place in town for sure..i seriously recomend this place...i would give them an award if i could..amazing service too by jenn who was wearing leopard pjs..so cute."}
{"text":"Food was very good, but had to wait an hour to be seated.  I would give this restaurant five stars if it wasn't for the wait, the poor organization, and horrible level of customer service by the hostesses."}
{"text":"Went in today,  the day before Thanksgiving, and the service was extremely slow.  In addition,  this place has an obsession with beans.  Beans in their breakfast burrito and an extra side of beans.  Country Cafe is 10x better than this place and I would never recommend it to anyone.   Sorry just NOT good at all."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the dirtiest restaurants I have ever been to. They DO NOT wash the coffee cups

This place is right by my house in Vegas (Southern Highlands). The first time I tried them, I had to send my coffee back because it had LIPSTICK ON THE COFFEE CUP. When the server brought back a \"new\" cup it had a DIRTY COFFEE RING on the inside (like coffee had been sitting in there, but not washed) I finally just asked for a to-go cup.

Decided to give them another chance since they are so close. The second time.......THE EXACT SAME THING. Coffee cup with dirty coffee ring on the inside, AGAIN!!!!? We IMMEDIATELY got up and walked out.

If you go here, make sure you inspect the cups / dishes.  Something is very wrong here."}
{"text":"My husband and I live in the area and always drive past this restaurant everyday and so finally we decided to give it a try on a Sunday Morning ! Wow it was awesome ! Seated right away, our waitress Laura was a doll and was excellent and very attentive to us. The atmosphere with the umbrellas hanging from the ceiling was so cute I was obsessed lol and not too mention the food was delicious, Definitely will be back again ! :)"}
{"text":"I love right by this place so I come here at least once or twice a week and I can safely say I have experienced the worst as well as the best. They revamped the menu so there are more food choices than there previously were. I love the steak and eggs but sometimes the steak will be over cooked or under cooked depending on the day who is making it. I would stay away from the poached eggs as they are normally undercooked as well. All in all if your meal is prepared right it is a great spot to grab a bite at. The manager doesn't share the wifi password which I find kind of odd, but to each their own. All the good servers usually get better jobs and move on so this place is usually stuck with the bottom of the barrel so to speak. Don't have high expectations coming here and you won't be disappointed, unfortunately I am stuck with this breakfast place until we get some competition on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Found this place a few weeks ago. We've been here EVERY weekend since.

Everything we've had has been absolutely amazing. Chicken fried steak is out of this world. Pancakes are to die for! Word to wise... Each pancake is huge, south short stack will likely be more than enough. :) Don't even get me started on the hash browns! Without a doubt, the best I've had!

Well be back again next weekend! :)"}
{"text":"The pot of bread was a really cool idea but wish it was a bit sweeter though. Also the steak omelet was the right size for me. Not too big that I would be blooded and not to small that I had to ask for seconds. Just big enough for me to be satisfied."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The chicken fried chicken & biscuts with sasage gravy was amazing! The wait staff is too cute in their \"PJs\" and everyone was super friendly and interested in our opinions if the food. My hundband loved the crunchy French toast. A definite must when we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"SUPER cute place, staff was friendly, food, Ultimate Steak and Eggs, fantastic!  Can't ask for anything else except delivery in bed!"}
{"text":"It is truly an early bird who catches a worm as the saying goes. My guess is that they've consumed some of the amazing eats from this gem of a restaurant while on the prowl.

On a recent visit with my Dad we ended up here back to back days during the trip and our only complaint was that the food was so scrumptious here that it pained us to leave the remains of the unconsumed on the plate. You certainly can share without embarrassment here as the portions (on most items) are enough to feed an army!

Before I get into the main attraction I do want to point out from top to bottom the staff here. Once again they are beyond inviting and the genuine care they portray to each table of patrons is a staple that they are well worth the 5 star rating from not just myself, but the other masses as well who choose to dine within those walls. I really feel so at home there and that is a special gift!

For day #1 I had my heart set on trying something different so I went for the red velvet chocolate chip pancakes. Those are a MUST if you have a craving for a \"short\" stack, but there is nothing short about that stack by any means. I was served 4 huge battered circular halos and with literal chunks of chocolate chips how can you go wrong? They were quite fluffy overall and the after taste of chocolate in each bite partnered with the cream cheese syrup it comes partnered with left me feeling like I was sharing a sunrise with Willy Wonka in the chocolate factory!

For day #2 I scaled it back a bit and devoured the pot of bread and the three egg breakfast with bacon on the side. It was simplistic in nature with just eggs, hash browns, and bacon however even in a simple form the food is still on point. The bacon (being the high point) was crispy and had a slight smoky tint to it that elevated it to a whole other level. I actually had a full on body shake because it was so amazing!

With top notch consistent hospitality, this is by far my #1 breakfast destination when I am in the area and it's been fun to watch the growing cult following they are getting as time goes on. To keep it simple, people know what's up!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken egg white omelette and it was amazing!!  Maria was my server and she was friendly and kind! My food was ready before I had a chance to finish my cup of coffee. I would recommend Rise & Shine Steak & Egg to those looking for a local breakfast spot in the Henderson area!"}
{"text":"Food is terrible, food over cooked and greasy. 
I have gone many times tried the so called home made corned beef hash, it was thinly sliced deli meat, the worst I ever ate
Eggs Benedict sauce too salty and they put so much on the muffin is mush. 
Went today ordered eggs over easy bacon and hash browns. Eggs came crispy had to return them, bacon looked cooked but wasn't and the hash browns were greasy over crispy. 
The cost for this and coffee 17.00!!!!
Never will eat here again.  Better food from McDonald's for 5.00"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here today for breakfast, we both got the smoked salmon eggs Benedict and we also shared the bread in the cup . Both were very yummy !! Our waiter was Vanessa, she was super nice and had a great personality! We recommend to come here !! And we will be back :)"}
{"text":"Great new breakfast spot!! Super friendly staff, excellent service & delicious food!!"}
{"text":"I was totally hyped to check this place out because I love love love chicken and waffles and really that's the only reason why I came here. I placed a to go order since the boyf wanted something else. We were greeted by this woman who either didn't want to be at her job or didn't want us to be at her job. I couldn't tell. Nonetheless, this brief and short interaction wasn't pleasant. 

I ordered chicken and waffles - both were bland. The chicken was a breast filet that desperately needed seasoning. The waffle although is a waffle, was nothing special either. Hey at least it wasn't eggo frozen waffle right? Ugh. I also had the breakfast plate of biscuits and gravy with 2 eggs and hash browns. Again, nothing special. The gravy was almost too salty and the hashbrowns were just meh. 

These 2 dishes were just MEHHHH!  

This place is overpriced and overrated. That lady needs attitude improvement (not necessarily everyone's service since this was a take out order I wouldn't know the general service). Go back to bed crabs! I will most definitely not return."}
{"text":"I read good reviews and so I went.
First impression restaurant packed with people inside and on waiting list, your seated quicker than served.
They are extremely busy and not able to help seated guest in a timely manner.

However, when you do get your food, it is wow with fresh ingredients and their bread in a cup yummy!

If you have the time to give up than I suggest."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Vegas! Great venue and amazing food. Came with a party of 6 and everyone loved their food. Ashley our host was amazing she was also very friendly and engaging.  Definitely will be coming back here again."}
{"text":"We were a bit disappointed with the food quality today. The coffee tasted burnt, but it turns out they changed the brand. We went for the French press the second round and it was better. The chicken on the chicken and waffles was almost burnt and same for the chicken fried steak. Over medium eggs were also over cooked. Also found the kitchen won't take the time to split the order on to two plates any more. It was a busy day for them, and our waitress was absolutely wonderful as always. We will be back and hope it was just an off morning."}
{"text":"Tried the steak and eggs with a glass of OJ. The OJ was freshly squeezed and amazing. The steak and eggs was also delicious. The cup-o-bread was sweet, warm and tasty."}
{"text":"Tried to place a to go order this morning. First the girl who answered kept saying Sienna Heights which was really confusing. She apparently is from a different location. When I tried to order they apparently need a cc on file. I don't want my cc on file. That's how people get scammed. I tried to get them to wave it so I can order a to go order, but they refused. They just lost a customer due to this. Either I pay $5 to deliver this or I have to risk the chance of them getting hacked and my cc gets stolen. Tacky way to handle business. Will not be coming back. Rise and shine prices are high as it is. I don't like to deal with places that refuse to service their customers. Wow."}
{"text":"I had the chicken and waffles and I loved the chicken but the waffles were doughy. My husband had the chillaquilles and that was really good and I think I'll try that next time. Service was nice too."}
{"text":"A wonderful place for breakfast or lunch. The decor was nicely done with colorful umbrellas etc. Our waitress Maria was dressed in PJ'S which was cute, she was pleasant ,accommodating & explained everything on the menu. Our food ( Breakfast) was excellent and enough of it. We can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"This would be my third time eating breakfast here.  Each time has been wonderful.  Quality of food is great.  Staff is very friendly.  I always order my steak well done and each time has been consistent.  Very tender.  Best breakfast place Ive seen in the valley. Beware this place gets pack fast.  I always go here at 8am and it's already full of people.  By 9am there is a waiting list.  My boyfriend and I waited for 30 minutes to get a table. Since they were very busy I thought the quality of food would not be as good.  I was wrong.  It was excellent.  Go here.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I am on a Vegas foodie adventure, and this spot hit a line drive right over the fence for a breakfast home run.  Professional juice bar, open kitchen, LavAzza French press coffee, waitresses wearing pajamas, just a fun place.  First up were the amazing homemade popovers with a maple infused cream delicious dipping sauce.  Main course was the well seasoned and properly charcoal grilled rib eye steak with 2 eggs over and nice crunchy hash browns.  Clearly a 4 star plus breakfast winner, will return for fried chicken and waffles tomorrow."}
{"text":"I would give it five stars, but my husband's utensils and plate have arrived dirty, which was a turn off for him. 

Overall, we love this place. Saturdays and Sundays are usually their busiest time, and weekdays are a breeze to get in. We live down the street, and so we go here frequently. They recently opened another location in Summerlin, but we haven't been there yet. They used Summerlin as sort of a \"test\" for their new menu, tweaked it there, and then changed their menu at this location. We've had everything there...and I mean that. We used to go there basically every weekend. The french toast and pancakes are to die for, according to the kids. My new \"super bad\" food addiction is their fried chicken breast and waffle. They bring their syrup out in a warmed bottle and you can see the fresh cinnamon inside. Yum. The servers are very kind and they all dress in pajamas, which is a neat vibe. They also have hanging flower/umbrella decorations, and the walls have neat colors and decor. Their portions are huge, so that accounts for the average $15/per plate (that is an estimate on my part), and you have plenty for leftovers. 

Oh, and the part I wrote above about the dirty utensils/plate? It happened once, and has never happened since. 

Like I wrote, this place is really worth a try. You'll be glad you made the trip."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast place on our drive home from Vegas.  The wait staff are dressed in pajamas which is super cute, the coffee was great and the food was excellent.  Everything is fresh and portions are decent.  Each traditional breakfast dish had a twist to it that separated it from the norm.  I'll definitely be back on my next drive to or from Vegas."}
{"text":"I visited this spot after Yelping the highest-rated breakfast restaurants in Las Vegas.  I was really excited about the \"bread in a pot\" which was reason enough to visit.  The decor is cute, slightly weird, but cute.  The servers wear pajamas and it took me a minute to realize it!

As for food, it's pretty underwhelming.  It's not terrible, but I was not impressed- no bold flavors.  The \"bread in a pot\" was bland and the chicken and waffles were pretty bland, too.  I won't ever be returning because I like a little more excitement when eating carbs and other foods in general.  

There are so many better breakfast places in Las Vegas, skip this one!"}
{"text":"The chilaquiles are by far one of the best items on the menu. Everything is made fresh and has been consistent every time we stop by."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to go to when Im in vegas. Their bkfast is great, and its really filling. The waitresses are in pj's and the place is pretty lit up with decor. Its a great place away from the strip."}
{"text":"Horrible! Service was terrible and the food was even worse. Ordered a steak dish with hollandaise sauce and potatoes. Steak was ordered medium rare, it can almost burnt. Eggs ordered over medium and it can with super runny whites. The potatoes tasted like they were cooked three times and put back into another container. I would of asked for a new breakfast but my server only came to my table twice, to take my order and to give me my check. She wasn't even the one to bring me my food. This was around 1pm or so and the place had two other tables occupied. Overpriced and definitely not worth going back"}
{"text":"Been here 3 tomes and each visit has been wonderful!  Steaks are cooked to perfection.  Love it!"}
{"text":"This marks the 10th time I have been there and I leave with the same impression every time. That is for the very mediocre food they are sure expensive and service is just plain bad!  OK so what is the problem? well two people for breakfast one being oatmeal was $35!!! My bagel with steak was overcooked and soggy hash brown and overall tasteless. They had to come out 3 times for my wife's oatmeal cause first trip they forgot the milk and fruit, then came the milk and forgot the fruit...mind boggling incompetence and they did this every single time we have been there so she can't start her breakfast and just sit there sometimes for 5 minutes! oh I ask for a large orange juice with two straws so the waitress decided to change it to a carafe and charged us $8.8!!! We are not complainers but this time like one time a year ago we said something and did anyone did anything? NOPE! what they do is to hand you a discount coupon, not write off the juice or anything , so the moral of their customer service is  TOO BAD BUT UNLESS YOU COME BACK, YOU MEAN NOTHING TO US SO HERE IS A COUPON FOR NEXT VISIT AND IF YOU DON'T COME BACK, THEN WHO CARE! That is the message, perhaps I should have left a note for the waitress, and say SORRY FOR NOT TIPPING BUT IF YOU DO IT RIGHT NEXT TIME I WILL TIP YOU!  Wonder how they would like that. I handed back the $5 coupon and said we won't need this as we will NEVER be back. we left a tip anyway, not that she deserve it cause when you can't serve oatmeal, you really need to think about a different profession!"}
{"text":"Normally I would give this place a 4 Star review, but on Sunday May, 3 2015 that all changed.  Granted this place is packed on the weekends and to keep pace with the knashing carnivors waiting anxiously to get in and get there feed on, the staff in nasty pajamas has to be on point with the kitchen.  This seems obvious right?  Well on Sunday there was a line out the door, normal, and the experience started like this:

The hostess, a girl I had not seen before and unfortunately did not get her name, asked us how many and told us that there would be a 15-20 min wait.  So I looked to the Bar which no one was at and asked if we could sit there.  First she eye rolled me and then said I don't know.  I asked if she could check and again the same exasperated eye roll that she might have fallen backwards from, \"Ill check,\" she said.  I waited 5 min while she talked to severs, played with her pen and gave the general I could give a rats hind end about you as a customer look and finally I asked if she even asked any one (of which she didn't because I was watching like a hawk with a caged animal in my stomache ready to leap from its depths and attack on site).  Also, I wasnt the only annoyed one as all the people were talking about how rude that hostess was.  She is definately not the face any owner would want at the FOH.  Lazy, non-caring, and rude.

While sitting waiting for Griselda the Mean to get back to me, I looked around and there were 6-8 four tops sitting with dirty dishes on them which would have acomodated most of the people outside waiting.  Those table stayed dirty for exactly 15 min before they started to be cleared.  This whole team led by there Manager Jessica, who didn't lift a finger to help any one and simply walked around with a face that could sink a1000 ships and then complained about the customers attitudes only a few feet from me.  Maybe its just me but the Manager should be the buisiest person in the restaurant, cleaning making sure that customers are taken care of, smiling, greeting, not hiding in corners and avoiding the crazy crowd that had acumulated outside the door.  Jessica only became interested in us when we asked for a comment card.  Then she couldn't stop walking behind me and my girlfriend looming over to get a peek at what was being written.  So unprofessional.  She was training...if you want to call it that, a server by the name of Cali for management, who was AWESOME.  She was sooooo weeded and still she took the time to come by and make sure that we were ok at least 3 times.  Great job on the floor Cali, hopefully you will be replacing Jessica so very soon!!

Food...well it was satisfactory this time.  My steak came out mooing at me, way rare (I ordered medium), and the hashbrowns were raw and I think if I equated it to a measuring cup I got a bout 1/3 of a cup of hashbrowns and the eggs over easy were dripping with oil, saturating everything on the plate.  The open air kitchen was getting slammed, plates were being thrown on the floor by the line cooks, (Seriously?) the cooks were openly swearing at the servers and calling them horrible names behind the line only 2 feet from me and I was able to hear everything.  Sloppy plating and the list goes on.  My girlfriend said here omlet was good but the pot of bread she ordered was raw about an inch down in the cup.

Sorry Rise and Shine, normally you all are so on point and friendly and look so comfy in your designer flannel pajamas.  Please understand people normally this place is the bomb, but under the horrible leadership that day it all came crashing down."}
{"text":"Delicious food and top notch costumer service.,Amberly was our waitress and she was exceptional , we are currently in our way to Vegas and already talking about what we are gonna have this time around .:') .. Give it a try ,you won't regret it ."}
{"text":"I went to this place when they opened their original location in southern highlands. Good then, good now.They wear pajamas and serve a mean breakfast. The French Toast is excellent. My wife had the chilaquiles. They had a spicy rub,   not that saucey. French roast coffee, they brought out sand timers to distinguish how bold you wanted it. That's different. We sat down immediately but the place looked pretty full, food came out quickly. I woukd come back. Welcome to Hendo!"}
{"text":"I'm very picky when it comes to Breakfast and most importantly eggs and how's certain people make them. I chose the ribeye and 3 eggs with cheddar and I had zero complaints!!!!! Will definitely return the atmosphere is nice and our server was definitely cool to."}
{"text":"I'm still annoyed about our wait. When you quote someone a wait time, your estimate should at the very least be within a ten minute window, not over three times as long as your quote. 

They also ran out of potted bread that day, which I was excited to try after reading other Yelp reviews. Our server told us that it would be another half hour wait for that menu item. Obviously, since we waited over an hour doe our table, I passed. 

That being said, the food and service here were both excellent. I had the chilaquiles, and my boyfriend opted for a standard breakfast dish with pancakes and bacon with eggs. Both dishes came out hot and delicious and in a prompt manner. While I'm glad we stayed to try this place out, I really do think the door staff could use some training on estimating wait times. Even after I complained to the hostesses that we had waited for over an hour, a manager never spoke to us to apologize. As I've worked in the industry for over fifteen years, I thought this was pretty unacceptable."}
{"text":"We love this place. I've had the Steak and Eggs Chilaquiles breakfast and it was soooo good. Their steaks are so tender and juicy. They also make fresh juices which I love."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat breakfast. The food is always delicious (the mug bread with the sweet cream cheese butter is my favorite). Three service is always wonderful especially Maria. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"A very cute brunch place! The waitresses wear pajamas and the restaurant is colorful with a friendly atmosphere. Our waitress was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. I had a bagel sandwich that had turkey and avocado with coffee. Service was fast and everything was very good"}
{"text":"AMAZING! they have great food & customer service, I had red velvet pancakes with eggs and sausage on the side, it was my first time trying red velvet pancakes, I was a bit skeptical but they were amazing very warm and they were just soooo fluffy and delicious! A little pricy but honestly well worth it. I would eat there again and again and again"}
{"text":"Good food, but very rude service.  Not accommodating with my 3lb chihuahua which is a service animal whom I bring everywhere with me.  They said she needed to be on a leash when she was in a baby carrier.  Stupid and not the law.  Won't go back ever again.  They don't like people with disabilities I guess."}
{"text":"First time visit this restaurant since it was close to our home, they tottally IGNORED US!, they have like 10 people who they're supposed to be working on tables (server/bussers), restaurant wasn't busy at all, they'are just standing, chatting, walking on circles, we read the entire food menu, wait for 25min without someone even asked us what do we like to drink, saw a busser just walking and playing with a rubber band, person making pastries without a hair net and looking more like a hair stylist, hostess uniform looks like she's been wearing it for a whole week without washing it.
This place seriously needs a new managment, looks like everyone is in a playground and don't care at all."}
{"text":"an excellent brunch experience! the name steak and eggs place is the tip of the iceberg! with top shelf cuts available with your eggs! 
we shared two succulent  dishes. the fried and  battered buffalo chicken breast breakfast is a brilliant switch on the typical country fried chicken and gravy! a medium buffalo sauce with hashbrown eggs and toast was tasty. 
our second dish was the Mexican twist on a rib eye steak breakfast! eggs placed on savoury bed of beans, cheese and chilaquiles! a rib eye! but wait there's more, salsa, sour cream and avocados! 
the place was busy yet we were seated in served in less than an hour! well worth the short wait. the staff has optional uniforms pajamas or company gear. creating a fun ambient."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while leaving las Vegas. It was out of the way but seemed worth it. The wait was 45 minutes which was kind of long but it was fine. The decor is so cute in this place very sunshiney and bright. I loved it. The staff wore pajamas and was very friendly! I ordered red velvet pancakes which was delicious! I loves this place!"}
{"text":"WTF. Seriously. This is the fourth time I've come here. And only ONE time was I treated nicely and fairly. Hence this review. Hoping a MANAGER OR OWNER MIGHT SEE IT!!! I'll just discuss today's debacle.  It started off great. No wait!! Even got a booth!! Waitress shows up... looking annoyed, disinterested in general. I felt like my entire visit went downhill from here.... 
I asked her for a large OJ... and I get a CARAFE.... is that large? Um. Ok. I asked for for a 1/2 order of French toast... which I got, yet... they were \"less fluffy\" and basically looked like I got the welfare white bread version instead of the Texas toast version. My 12 year old daughter asked for chocolate chip pancakes and eggs/bacon....this is where it gets \"interesting\". She's 12... not 15 or 20... ya think the waitress bothered to ask me 1 question? Or tell me sizes or maybe whether we want the adult or child or just completely ala carte? Nope not a word. (Let's \"pad the check\"...huh). So when she brought out my 12 year olds breakfast... you might has well thought she's a LUMBERJACK!!! Because that's what the waitress ordered for her. 4 supercalifragilistic ginormous god damn pancakes. And a small side of some crappy tiny eggs and burnt bacon. I sat there dumbfounded. When she finally came back around, I had already finished my \"French toast\" and asked her what this was... POINTING to my daughters meal. I asked her why she didn't tell us it was for a lumberjack. Why didn't she steer us to something more HER SIZE?? Basically she was speechless... then with an attitude she said \"I can take off 2 pancakes\"... but the look on her face was right out of the movie \"waiting\"... (ummm... ya know...yikes... like I'll take the food back and spit on it.) So I declined. Of course my daughter didn't finish the Paul Bunyan meal. So we go to leave to pay the check. She rushes up to hand me the check and says nothing. The cashier asks me how everything was. I complained. Did anyone get a manager. Did the cashier apologize or offer any assistance. NO. NO. NO. NADA. NYET. NOTHING. It's not like I'm looking for a free meal. I paid the whole $35 god damn dollars for a senior size French toast, a lumberjack meal and 1 \"large\" OJ. $35 dollars. THIRTY-FIVE FRICKING DOLLARS FOR BREAKFAST. Way to pad the check. I am so aggravated at the bullshit. At the LACK of assistance and LACK of service, as well as the LACK of common decency. Yeah I said that. Because who in their right mind gives a child a big ass ala carte sized meal. That's completely ridiculous. And I even gave that jerk waitress a tip. I do plan on calling and \"trying\" to speak to a manager or owner. I just don't know if they will have the same attitude as their employees. Ugh."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Bring family here all the time. Affordable breakfast!! Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Love the potted bread! outstanding service!! If you ever have Lisa as your waitress , she's absolutely amazing!!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing! Food was amazing! Prompt service! Clean atmosphere! Great hostess! Great start to our trip!"}
{"text":"The food there is OK but overpriced. No matter what I seem to order my breakfast always seems to come out to $25. A little high for three cent egg."}
{"text":"This is our go-to breakfast spot on the weekends. We always request to get sat with Riley - because she's awesome and so on point. It's always so nice to walk into a place where there's good food and friendly service. I always try to mix it up with what I order but lately I've been ordering the chicken breast and waffle - and I haven't been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"This place was good! Very crowded but the wait wasn't too bad. Our waitress Rylee was amazing and always around if we needed something. The pot of bread is to die for and a must order. I want to go back just for 5 orders of that. The only thing that wasn't amazing was the steak, it was dry and tough. However it could have been an off day. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"First time eating here..we've lived here for 3 years. Our little hood..lol. Super crowded on Saturday morning, we didn't wait long. We were gonna leave, but the aroma was so good, smell of waffles and bacon..We had to wait. It was worth it..Ed had spinach, Avocado, and swiss Omelette, with home potatoes. I had the fat kid breakfast..Pancakes..Real warm maple syrup. .Bomb!! Bomb!! Wait staff was super curtious, and in thier pj's. Lol.."}
{"text":"Great little find on the way out of town, I will definitely put this on the rotation when I'm in Vegas. I had the eggs benadict and it was amazing best part was the hash Browns, perfectly seasoned with the right amount of crisp. Waitress was great also."}
{"text":"Found this away from the strip spot,so worth the drive!

With three in my group we enjoyed the decor and friendly helpful service. The coffee was best so far, since being in Vegas 

The waffle combo was absolutely delicious,  fluffy and great flavor. Strawberries on the side and crispy perfect bacon!

We didn't get to try the bread in a cup but it looked amazing, a must revisit spot!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located for us. We love the ambience. My kids enjoy it here too. They think it's kind of cool how the waiters are in PJ's. Their fresh squeezed orange juice is a must here! As well as the bread in a pot. All the entrees we all order, we all enjoy and continue to re-order whenever we come back. 

Sunday's have loooong waits. Don't go hungry."}
{"text":"Delicious food and good service! Definitely should try it out, won't regret. The service is fast. The portion of the meal is huge. Loved it here."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best breakfast places we have ever been to, hands down and we don't live in this state. The restaurant environment is so welcoming and happy. The servers even wear pj's as their uniform! How cool is that! Also, you should definitely try the cup-o-bread and hash browns... You will not be disappointed :) So, so tasty!"}
{"text":"Rise & Grind is a really cute place to grab breakfast with family/friends, or you can choose to go alone and sit at the bar. They serve my favorite coffee (illy) and offer these cute little plant pots of cinnamon bread. (FYI; you need to arrive early to receive a pot of bread. They only make 100 a day) The prices are a little high for breakfast but you do receive a good portion of food. There's a variety of items on the menu to choose from. I will definitely visit again to enjoy my illy coffee and try something new."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! Definitely a must when in Vegas! Big portions and great service. I highly recommend the rise n shine chilaquiles!!"}
{"text":"They still struggle with how to make eggs over well.  This is not good for a place that has breakfast as a focus.  Their eggs are horrible and I was again disappointed with the lack of ability to actually make french style eggs over well, crispy on the outside,  firm and not broken yolk.  The pot of bread is good, but the lack of specialty coffee just is not enough for a place serving breakfast.   A year later and no improvement is not acceptable.  I hope to give them more stars next time because I love local egg breakfast places.  This place makes me want to stay home and cook my own food.  Woah, did I just say that?  I hate cooking."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this place!! Wish we could buy a franchise. Really!! That's how good it was. The staff was very customer focused. The food was delicious with a great variety. Everything we ordered was good. This review is being written long after we ate there; but, it is a place we will make a point to get back to the next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very cool place. Staff is courteous and friendly. Portions are large and prices is an average of $11 a plate. Food is tasty and the decor is fun and quirky and a great place for family breakfast. A must visit when you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great because it's close, food is good and prices are fair. They serve Illy coffee(yay), I get the chicken and waffles or rib eye chiliquilles. By 9am is busy and wait is 30-45 min on weekends, we usually go past brunch time. Thats when i wake up anyway on weekends.So it works out perfectly....hehe"}
{"text":"The staff wears their PJ'S to work in. I like the upside down rotating shape umbrellas in the ceiling."}
{"text":"Our second time here. We were satisfied with food and service. We ordered the buffalo fried chicken steak and eggs- the proportion was a good amount, the coating on the steak was well seasoned, the meat was tender and delicious. We also has the steak and chilaquiles- the chilaquiles topped with an egg had good salsa and was very good. To my surprise the steak was very good. It wasn't chewy or fatty. It was tender and well seasoned. The coffee was good too. We will be back."}
{"text":"The first time I went there it was one of the best breakfast I have had in this town I went with their ultimate ribeye and egg breakfast...Sense then I have went back twice each time to only get a steak that was so fatty and grizzly that you almost couldn't eat it.... has quality really dropped out that far... I mean At one time I would have recommend this to everyone I know and now I would recommend it to no one....Who wants a steak that you have to push half of it to the side because they're is so much fat.... Unfortunately their quality has declined immensely but that's only for them to decide what kind of customers they really want..."}
{"text":"Very cute local breakfast spot, all the servers wear pajamas. I was very pleased with the service I received last time I visited. My server's name was Vanessa, and she was the sweetest!!! Very attentive, pleasant, and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Woke up Easter morning a little late and was a little frantic to find a place to eat. Luckily, we found Rise & Shine. The atmosphere was light and happy, especially with the waitresses in their pajamas! The food was just as enjoyable as the experience. The food presentation was incredible and the service felt more than just a generic \"nice to meet you\" vibe. Overall, I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone that wants to have a fantastic breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Place has really gone downhill... Using cheaper ingredients and still charging same expensive prices... Very disappointed. Food was terrible"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here for breakfast when I'm in town.   The food is always good and the price is decent.   I'm not as big of a fan of their lunch menu but I could eat their breakfast for lunch and dinner (if they were opened for dinner).

My favorite is the Corned Beef Hash and Eggs and also the Ribeye and Eggs.   Both are cooked well and very tasty.   

I also like the hash browns here,  they have a nice crisp to them.   They used to give you little pots of bread but stopped doing that.  That was a nice touch I wish they would bring back.

Service from the waitresses is typically very good and service prompt even when busy.   

Seems like the primary hostess is not always happy to be working early in the morning.  She rarely has a smile on her face."}
{"text":"It's the best kept secret in Vegas.  Located in the Southern Highlands area, a lot of locals end up here for breakfast on weekends.  Staff is friendly (dressed in pajamas) and service is quick.  I have liked everything I've had on the menu. Fun place to have breakfast and relax."}
{"text":"Found this breakfast spot on yelp based on the reviews. After waiting for an hour for a table, the waitress told us that they were out of pot of bread. The one reason I wanted to try the restaurant was for that bread. Disappointed, we ordered peanut butter and blueberry French toast and a steak Benedict. The food came out quickly and the steak was prepared pretty close to perfect. The food was amazing the coffee was quite delicious and the service was excellent. As we sat around chit chatting after our meal, the waitress brought out a fresh and hot pot of bread! She surprised us all and created a WOW moment! The bread was delicious and perfect even though we were stuffed, we made sure to eat it all up! I would definitely return and recommend this little gem of a breakfast place! There is no doubt why they were voted a best of the best!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day. They have EVERYTHING including GF stuff if someone in your party has dietary restrictions. Try the Green \"Go Go\" Juice."}
{"text":"I dined here for the first time last Sunday.  It was absolutely delicious.  They have a huge assortment of food and a fun ambiance.  They are very busy in the weekends but seem to get people through fairly quickly.  I enjoyed the green juice to start and then ordered the classic steak and 2 egg breakfast.  The steak was cooked perfectly.  My friend ordered the biscuits and gravy and he loved it too.  Go give it a try!"}
{"text":"We came here 2 weeks ago with our children.  They cleaned their plates and asked if we would come back.  Which says a lot in our family.  My husband loved his steak and eggs.  I had a Bloody Mary.  It was a meal in itself.  I also got a side of biscuits and gravy.  It was just the right size.  

We are back again this week.  I got an avocado Benedict.  It was great.  Our friend got the s'mores pancakes.  They smelled delicious.  Our server was attentive.  She noticed that the pancakes were missing something and fixed it before we could ask. 

We  definitely be back a third time."}
{"text":"This breakfast restaurant has been in the southern highlands plaza for awhile and I've never had a bad experience here other than maybe a 10min wait at most because it can get busy. The fresh squeezed orange juice and freshly baked pot of bread with powdered sugar are amazing. I've ordered many items in the past among those the corned beef hash, ribeye steak and eggs, salmon lox bagel, steak and spinach eggs benedict, chicken fried steak and all are good."}
{"text":"Ooh! I love this place! My husband just discovered it and we've been twice so far. We went to both locations. Great food! Steak & eggs are delicious!! Fresh squeezed orange juice! I also tried the omelette and my daughter had a waffle one time and pancakes the next time. Everything tastes delish! My daughter is super picky but she loves this place, especially because one of the food servers gave her a nice side of whipped cream. Oh and the style inside is really cute. Big flowers hang from the ceiling. Very colorful."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast spot. I had the pancakes with the 2 egg and turkey keilbalsa wich came with real maple syrup and cinnamon. Great customer service and I was very impressed by the presentation and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!  We dine in here on a regular basis and the food, service and fresh squeezed juice is always on point! Yesterday we placed a to go order with Chris and she was awesome!  Only reason they don't get 5-stars is they are a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Very good for our family of 7 on our way to the lion habitat! Bagel sandwiches were huge. 3 little pigs version- Hungry teenagers couldn't eat it all! Omelettes were nice. Chicken and waffles very good. Pleased with waitstaff all in jammies! Very attentive."}
{"text":"The boyfriend finally agreed to go out for breakfast and this made me beyond happy. The place: Rise and Shine in Southern Highlands. Very quaint, family-run breakfast/lunch spot.

We arrived just after 11 and had a 20 min wait. Thank goodness for the gorgeous Fall weather.  Our name was finally called and a 10-13 year old brought us to our table. Normally, the idea of children working in a restaurant annoys me. Restaurants is a serious business and throwing your underaged kids in the mix is more distracting than it is helpful. But at R&S, this little one was very mature and informative.  Pleasant surprise.

The wait staff are garbed in PJ sets to match the name of the restaurant. Clever. But the food...not overly complicated and that's how I like my favorite meal of the day.

-Corned beef hash with eggs: yum! Not my typical choice but happy I did this time.
-Peanut Butter and Blueberry jam French toast: this was a buffer dish in case the hash didn't work out but then I just ended up way stuffed.
-Spiced Rib eye steak and eggs: this was the bf's meal. Served with the egg atop nachos instead of the meat was odd and looked very heavy to me. He said it wasn't bad. The streak was seasoned well as I had to try at least one piece.

There are no TVs for distraction so it's a great place for families with kids. Can't wait to go back to try their pot of cinnamon bread as they ran out this time.  Food was good but service will make me a repeat guest."}
{"text":"There isn't a better place in town for Ham and Eggs Benedict. Staff is always friendly and the food just delivers every time."}
{"text":"First time here.  Certainly won't be my last! Had the Steak and Chilaquiles which was amazing! The Pot of Bread was really yummy too! Other things I had a taste of were the Red Velvet Chocolate Chip Pancakes and the Cinnamon Raisin French Toast which I highly recommend since my kids pretty much cleaned their plates.  Overall, food was great, service was great, a definite new favorite place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.  Everything I've had has the little touches that makes it better.  The oj is fresh squeezed and the coffee is good.  I've had the steak chilaquila a couple of times and I think that's the best thing.   The cinnamon raisin French toast is also a winner.  Only thing this place lacks is a bar. I really like a bloody mary. Another minus is the wait sometimes an be quite long."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Waited more than 15 minutes to be seats. food was okay. The owner had a rude attitude when I spoke to her about an issues. Would never come here and eat again."}
{"text":"Great experience here yesterday with a girlfriend of mine! We went bright and early for breakfast and catching up. The food was great, it was a quiet Monday morning at rise and shine which allowed for us to catch up. All the servers were super sweet and friendly, we will certainly be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"The service here is very spotty. We arrive and or our name in and notice 3 table available. One party gets sat and the other two are left open and we continue to wait. All the while the rest of the patrons start to clear out were kept waiting now with multiple tables open. We get sat in the back by the kitchen and service station. How annoying, why would you sit a patron in the back by the service station when there's other tables available? When I worked in the service industry I would apologize to patrons for them having to sit there. So now all the traffic of running food and imputing orders is right in my face. The waitress is barking orders at the cook and complaining about her station and another server.... Very unprofessional if you ask me. Also the table that was used as the bus station was the table we sat by. Pretty disappointing to experience this when I make it a point to drive all the way here when I'm in town. Not sure if I care to come back."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new brunch place so I clicked on the nearby icon and this place popped up. Why not? Walked in and the place was really open and inviting and we didn't have to wait at all, even at 12:30 on a Saturday. Pretty simple menu, and service was great. I'll admit my hash browns were undercooked, but now that I know how they come I will just tell them well done next time. And I will definitely be back. Make sure you check out the t-shirts and socks. My favorite one said \"spooning leads to forking\" lol. Also the wait staff wears pajamas. What a job!"}
{"text":"The place has an amazing menu. My friends and I each order different things and share. The chicken and waffles has to be my favorite. I also enjoyed the french toast. I think we ate here atleast three times while we were in Vegas. Large portions and the prices were decent."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast joint in town. Their Chicken and Waffles is to die for. Everything on their menu is deliciously homemade from scratch and all the ingredients are fresh. The staff is very helpful, friendly and fast. The atmosphere is very fun and casual.  I have ordered carryout from them a couple times and all were pleasant experiences."}
{"text":"This place is delicious . They have great customer service... but everyone has pajamas but MIKE... MIKE deserves pajamas... LET MIKE WEAR PAJAMAS NOW!!!!!"}
{"text":"Was in the area on a weekend and decided to try this place out, its tucked in a corner of the plaza, where Smith's is located. Large selection of breakfast items, lots to choose from. We did ask the waiter what he recommends. Items we ordered were the country fried steak and the salmon benedict. Both very delicious! Country fried steak was not dry at all and the gravy was very tasty. If you like bendicts than the salmon benedict is definitely worth trying! Very yummy!!!! Looking for a causal breakfast brunch place here's the place to try! will be coming back here soon to try their other dishes on the menu!"}
{"text":"Very busy place - the staff does a good job at keeping on pace and keeping everyone moving through . The food and menu isn't anything above average but it's good fills the purpose. The PJ uniforms and Umbrellas are a bit off putting, I get the concept but at least provide your staff with some quality PJS instead of making them work in paper thin see through pjs they just look sloppy ."}
{"text":"This place embodies the phrase, \"Rise and Shine.\" Waiters are in pajamas, merchandise have breakfast puns on them, and decor has floral print all over. I actually enjoyed it all. 

I ordered the Rise & Shine Burrito, which was amazing. I love large portions of food and this burrito satisfied that. It came covered in Ranchero and Green sauce (half and half). The burrito came with refried beans, which I asked to substitute for something else. For whatever reason the waitress said that wasn't possible, so I just went along with the beans. Ultimately, the refried beans were actually really good too! I also ordered a coffee, and the staff made sure that the coffee cup never became empty. 

The one thing that bothered me was that the menu had A LOT going on, but that's just me being picky."}
{"text":"This has turned into my absolute favorite breakfast spot! The service is great, I love the pj theme and how laid back yet respectful the employees are. The food never disappoints! The portions are great. I always get the chilaquiles w steak or without, either way they're scrumptious. They come with avocado, beans, sour cream. Sooo delicious. I've also tried the veggie egg Benedict with balsamic vinegar, overall it was good. The juices are fresh and amazing. I love waiting outside and the waiters never forget about you. I've been recommending this place to friends and family. Every time I post pics of the plates I get sooo many messages asking where it's from. You guys have a loyal customer here."}
{"text":"A breakfast place where the waitresses dress in pajamas is sort of neat. A breakfast place with no Wi-Fi? That ain't good..."}
{"text":"Great bfast spot!  Typical American style menu with some added variety. Smoothies are awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is really convenient and nice to have around. If you have the time to actually go out for breakfast it satisfies. Its a small place though so going at peak times you can wait. The servers all wear pajamas, upside down umbellas hang from the ceiling and its very quirky in decorations.  The service was good with her continually asking if we need anything and bringing drinks. only issue was he ordered a biscuit and got served sourdough toast. 
There aren't many healthy options on the menu so I got a cobb salad minus a few things. They were good about putting my bacon on the side for him.  It was very good with a nice balance of all the ingredients and not too heavy on the dressing.  It was huge though and I couldn't finish it all so we switched plates....lol.....he got the bacon wrapped steak and eggs and he enjoyed it, only thing left on his plate when he gave it to me were the hashbrowns.  The bread is simple bread as not a fan of the pot of bread as not enough cinnamon gooey-ness if I am going to splurge. 
The guy who you go to in order to pay wasn't sure what to make of our sense of humor but he was very polite and efficient.
Last time I was here I got the fruit which is nicely cut up and a nice size portion.  I would go back as convenient and good options for kids too."}
{"text":"Four weary adults were leaving Las Vegas, in search of breakfast.  We found this place on Yelp, read the reviews, and figured it was worth a try.  We were not disappointed.

A variety of food filled our table, from omelets, to pancakes, bacon, eggs over-easy, hashbrowns and sausages.  Everything was fresh, HOT and delicious.  The coffee was exceptional, and the pot of bread and biscuits were warm and satisfying.

Service was extremely friendly, without being overbearing, and there is no doubt that we will return to Rise & Shine!

One important thing to add.  There were no TV's in the place, which is such a welcome thing in any restaurant these days, but especially after the sensory overload of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to have a brunch while casually celebrating my husband's birthday. There was going to be a total of 8 family members, varying in age from 23-86, so in other words, a variety of palates to please. Since we all live in town, but not all in the same area, I wanted a place that was easily accessible for those that lived further & not too far, for the senior drivers. 

When I stumbled upon Rise & Shine in my Yelp search, and saw the huge quantity of great reviews, I knew, that we had to give it a shot. I knew in advance that they didn't take reservations, so I warned everybody that we could have a possible wait, a 15 minute average on the weekend mornings, I was told. Everybody, whether via phone or in person, was delightful, and the service was just as good at our table. I don't recall our server's name, but she handled our table of 8, no problem. The food was great! Almost everybody ordered something different and not one complaintThe prices were very reasonable, for the quality & quantity of food."}
{"text":"Perfect for when you're hungover and probably just as good when you aren't. I hardly had any money so I just got toast and peanut butter because I was in dire need of carbs in my system and it made me feel 100 x better. Can't wait to actually try the real things on the menu next time!"}
{"text":"I've noticed a difference in the quality since the last time I came, unfortunately I forgot to take a picture before the review. Their portions are WAY too big for one. And secondly the eggs benedict I ordered were drenched in a pool of sauce and the hash browns next to them turned out soggy due to it. There wasn't as much spinach as I'm used to there being. The consistency in quality should be upheld, there shouldn't be fluctuations. Their juices and smoothies are always amazing though."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best customer service experience I've had in a while. Great service! Maria, our waitress, was  amazing! Had us all seated down in less than 5 min with our waters and menus ready to go! Mind you we were a party of 10( including 2 kids) The food was excellent, coffee was nice and warm, and the bread in a cup was tasty! Would recommend this place for sure! Also, everyone that works there wear pjs, how cool is that."}
{"text":"Omelettes are a very simple item to make. Eggs, cheese, and some fixings.  The omelette I had was off the charts. Never in my wildest dreams did I think an omelette could be as magical as a leprechaun flying on a unicorn. This place is great. The pajama wearing staff are the friendliest bunch of people I have encountered all day.  I will be back. A"}
{"text":"Our second time here today and like the first time, it was splendid.  The server we got today Jennifer was very nice but lacked the service we got last time. Thankfully for Seth he saved the day. He is awesome and from our hour visit, he sat us down, checked on us, got our second drink order and evem saw him
cleaning the outside windows. We will definately be coming back."}
{"text":"I love how cute this restaurant is. The wait staff wear pajamas and there are adorable upside down flower umbrellas that adorn the ceiling. 

I've tried a few things on the menu but today I'll focus my review on the Chicken & Waffles. The batter for the Chicken comes off as really spicy and peppery (if you don't like spice it will be too much for you) and it's paired with your usual waffle. The trick though is to smother it all with the maple sauce and voila! The sweet off sets the spicy perfectly for the right amount of salty, sweet with spice. 

The tables are placed really close together so if you're not into that kind of thing, this isn't the place for you. It can get really busy, especially on the weekends. The open layout leaves you to view the kitchen and the cooks like a diner so the atmosphere is really casual. 

Overall, if you're in the area I'd say definitely give this place a try. They're only open for breakfast and lunch though so if you're trying to go there in the late afternoon, I'd call first because they're probably closed."}
{"text":"We came here about a month ago based on ratings and were not disappointed. Staff was good and food was great. It's cool that they wear pajamas. Will come again for a third time next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Our first few visits were great. The service was efficient, the food was well prepared and made with quality ingredients (fresh & flavorful). We have been bringing visitors to Rise & Shine telling them what a \"great place\" it is. Unfortunately, our experiences of late have not been great. The service has slowed considerably. Drinks are empty before refills are offered. Butter or syrup come well after the meal is served. The food is room temperature and the portions have diminished. Tomatoes are yellow and scarce in a dish, eggs are dry and overlooked, toast is barely brown. The fruit waffles are just a plain waffle with fruit in a cup on the side. There are a lot of restaurant options for Southern Highlands area. It is disappointing that Rise & Shine isn't maintaining the original level of service & quality needed to keep my patronage."}
{"text":"Okay so I'm reviewing 1 star because of the awful service I always receive. It never fails. I've been here over 10 times and I can't ever seem to get good service. I am a server myself so I know the drill. The hostess gave better service and I have tipped her before tipping the server. I live down the street so it is convenient and the food is so amazing! The pot of bread is to die for! But it takes the server about 5-10 minutes to even greet me. Then I don't see them again till I get my check. This place has so much potential but it is sad that I am starting to do take out because the service sucks ;("}
{"text":"Immediately walking into Rise & Shine we were greeted by the smell of cinnamon...the interior is delightful, and the staff is amazing!  This is mine and my husband's second time here..we brought his brother to show off the abundance of food served and the delectible flavors!  Our server April was genuinely nice and friendly.  I ordered the short stack which I didn't finish because it was more like a full stack!  They were all very attentive, never had an empty glass.  By far the nicest staff and the most delicious food!  My husband and I plan to make this place a ritual in our weekly outings!"}
{"text":"Made this choice because of other Yelp reviews and to get OFF THE STRIP ITS ABOUT A 15 minute drive huge portions fun atmosphere wait staff wear pajamas and the ceiling has colorful umbrellas hanging from ceiling"}
{"text":"Chilaquiles were amazing! I have to respond to some of the Yelp reviews, first of all the one customer that was complaining about the Chilaquiles, do you even know what they are? The tortilla chips are supposed to be soft, they are soaked in enchilada sauce before making, and are made with eggs, it's a mexican breakfast dish. I thought they were so good. Next, the complaint about the chicken and waffles, my friend had them & they were equally good, the breast was tender and flavorful. I've been here a couple times and had a couple different items on the menu, I have never had anything disappointing. Customer service has always been top notch. Love the French press coffee and the pot of bread & fresh jam. They also have a patio, people bring their dogs, comfy table & chairs with umbrellas."}
{"text":"No complaints what so ever! 

Staff is amazing and very friendly. 
Food is very new & refreshing. 
the ' pot-o-bread' is adorable & very delish.

Great place for families!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. The country fried steak taste like real steak. Big portions and good food, everyone who I bring here leaves happy"}
{"text":"Good food! Def expensive for breakfast food! But the quality is there. The chicken fried steak
Taste like real steak, which was a nice surprise and good size portions."}
{"text":"Menu changed. Service is inconsistent. Some days are ok some days bad. Some servers there don't understand concept of service. Some are ok. Also tried to order pickup for the family (7 people) couldn't get through when I did I was hung up on 6 times. Oh well even if it is walking distance from me I won't be back. I shouldn't have to feel like a bother when I'm there or when trying to give my business away."}
{"text":"OOMG...sat at the counter and got to see the magic firsthand.  Chicken fried steak  never before seen by these mortal eyes.  Chicken and waffles fit for a giant with culinary tastes(the chicken must have been from a Nevada A-bomb site- it was HUGE).  Panko breaded fresh chicken strips for the little ones.  Hand cut fries.  Ecletic breakfast menu- \"One of each please\".  My first time was today and second time will be tomorrow."}
{"text":"First time in this place, the atmosphere is family friendly. I had Buffalo boneless chicken  and eggs and pot of bread, my wife had the rib eye steak and eggs. They were both cooked to perfection, very tasty and we loved that they give you big portion. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Our family of 5 waited patiently as the rude staff kept seating parties of two than parties of four who walked in WAY after us. We asked if we could pull a table together and they said NO. A military veteran and his family being mistreated like that was uncalled for. We walked out after being left standing for almost half an hour and what a BAD rap this location gives to other locations who are more respectful and accommodating.. Shame on you!"}
{"text":"Rise and shine chilaquiles are the shit, better than my abuelitas. Amber is the best server here, tip her the big bucks!"}
{"text":"Not worth the price. Their food is good, but not great. Service was a little slow and I was sitting at the counter. This place seems to always be busy so maybe I was there on an off day or maybe I was just not feeling it. Suggestions to the owner: check your pricing. Your not on the strip."}
{"text":"Crunchy Cinnamon Raisin French Toast - DELICIOUS. Coated in Cinnamon Toast Crunch, this was the best breakfast item out of all the things I ordered. They gave you a good hefty serving too.

The steak - really quite terrible. My medium-rare steak was super thin, dried out, under-seasoned, medium-well, and tasted mostly like char. It was super disappointing.

At least they had real fresh squeezed orange juice, a staple of any brunch place. Too bad it wasn't good enough to wash away the taste of burned steak from my mouth. For a place that has \"steak\" in the name, they sure know how to serve a half-disappointing brunch."}
{"text":"i got the ny strip benedict bagel and it definitely was tasty but also a mess to eat. oh well! while i won't complain about the food the atmosphere and pricing weren't great. $3.50 for a cup of apple juice. the dining room is pretty small and there's no waiting area so everyone was crammed in the doorway."}
{"text":"I'd love to give this place 5 stars for their GREAT SERVICE and DELICIOUS food but it's just a bit OVERPRICED. $9 for a single waffle is ridiculous. But it doesn't stop me from dining here and ordering the buffalo chicken and eggs special."}
{"text":"We've been to the other locations before and it never ceases to impress or satisfy our hunger. We decided to try the Henderson location this time around.

Definitely was not disappointed. If you're familiar with the other locations, it's the same menu besides the specialty drinks. Started off with the cup o bread. One of my personal favorites. With a hint of cinnamon it's definitely reminiscent of a homemade cinnamon roll with a sweet and slightly tart and tangy icing that goes perfectly with it. Also started off with a single biscuit. This is where it goes from five stars to four. Biscuit seemed a little W. Not as crisp and as flaky as I remember it from the other locations.

I want to hadn't had the biscuits and gravy with two eggs and hash brown. Grady is very rich, chunks of sausage and I believe him add a decadent taste to the silkiness. I couldn't tell if these biscuits were not as flaky as the one I had previous because it was drowned in the savory gravy. Two eggs over medium cooked perfectly and hashbrowns golden perfection and of course the green onions inside the hashbrowns always add the extra kick. Gave this is Danny five out of five. I added the side of bacon to give it a little bit more of that salty savory taste.

We also had the chilaquilles and went to head and splurged and got the steak at it with it. Basic chips over beans covered in red sauce and we have the eggs scrambled. The sauce poured over the tortilla chips is a simple red sauce, very reminiscent of an enchilada sauce. The beans at the bottom were a bit overcooked and dry. The steak was cooked medium as requested and had a very simplistic salt and pepper taste to it which we love.

Had the French press coffee for a stronger coffee taste. 5.95 for a press that served about a cup and a half each for 2 people.

This location is a tad bit small so you tend to hear everything that goes on. There was a Chef or a cook in the open area where the runners and servers go to pick up the food who we could hear on the phone. Not very professional especially when you're using profanity. But other than that Maria, our server was top notch and make sure we were plenty well taken care of."}
{"text":"Stopped here with the family yesterday and the food was pretty good until I got a hair in my pancakes. I told them I didn't want them any more and just ate part of my wife's food since I wouldn't be able to eat pancakes thinking about the hair after that. They took the pancakes off the bill but charged $4 for the sides. Seriously, you ruin my meal and the whole family's experience and then you don't even take my personal meal off the bill? Good food, weak customer service. If they had been reasonable I might be back but that's just too little to resolve a problem, especially when breakfast is $15 bucks a plate. Everyone knows you can get a hair anywhere but anyone who works in or owns a restaurant knows you can't charge for the plate that had the hair in it. I didn't expect anyone else's meal discounted but the one with the hair should have been taken off. Get real.

It seems they responded that sides weren't included in the price unless you made the meal a platter...which I did so their point is moot."}
{"text":"What happened?? I've been here about 3 or 4 times in the past and it was my favorite breakfast place. My last visit made me realize that I am no longer a fan. 

My favorite breakfast dishes of all time would have to be chicken n' waffles and corn beef n' hash with eggs. And by far the best place I've had them was at Bouchon inside the Venetian. I know I can't compare a local place like this to an upscale fancy casino spot. However, I've had those two dishes at other places that were by no means fancy and it was still delicious. So I know I'm not being picky. But I was truly disappointed with what I was served on my last visit. 

The corn beef n' hash I ordered was a total disappointment. First I ordered the eggs medium. When my food arrived, they weren't yolky at all. It was cooked completely through. The hash was complete mush and the corn beef was sparse. I hate wasting food, so I ate as much as I could, but I still left some on my plate. The cinnamon bread they serve in the pot was my fave. 

My bf ordered the chicken n' waffles. This was a lot better than my dish. The chicken was crisp and the waffle warm. The chicken was a bit on the dry side so I just smothered it with syrup even more. I love that the syrup is served warm with a cinnamon stick inside the bottle. 

My bf is a huge coffee drinker during breakfast. He will probably go through 3-5 cups. He said that the coffee tasted like the coffee you get at a hospital, so when he only had about 1.5 cups, I knew there was something off. 

3 stars for being seated quickly, our super friendly waitress Shannon and the cute decor. I was really excited to bring the bf to a new breakfast spot, but I'm sad to say that I will not be returning. I will miss the pot of bread though."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 5 stars because the food is just so delicious! Everything I have tried has been amazing but the prices are a bit ridiculous, sadly mostly everything is overpriced and the portions are just ok."}
{"text":"Great family eatery.  Cool decor, tasty food for us and the kids and our waitress was awesome (April).  Will definitely return and take out of towners for a treat.  I might even wear my pajamas."}
{"text":"Every time my parents are in town we have to come here multiple times. My dad says he doesn't know why we would risk anywhere else when we still haven't had everything on the menu at rise and shine... 

I'm not really a huge fan of breakfast restaurants in general and even I like this place. The chicken and waffles, bagel sandwiches, and anything with steak are always reliable. Also, try the pot of bread, it's yummy and adorable!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for Sunday morning bfast. Love the menu, service and everything. Waiting sucks, restaurant is small, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Went to Rise & Shine today for breakfast. We were very disappointed!!! 
Our cinnamon French toast was very dry & very well done! Burned!!! Fruit was not fresh. Rotten strawberries & bananas! Brown in color. Avocado was brown! The owner & our favorite waitress was not there. I'm really surprised the standards have drop. The fresh orange juice was water down! I'm truly sad because this was one of my favorite breakfast spots."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast this morning at GVR Rise & Shine! Delicious! Loved the green juice. I had a Cheese omelette with avocado & fruit. Excellent service. Our waitress was very pleasant and attentive. 
The family was pleased and ate every bite and cleaned their plates. They serve lunch as well. 
Clean and cute. Love the umbrellas on the ceiling."}
{"text":"We sat for 15 mins and weren't greeted/ acknowledge AT ALL by our waitress. I get that it's busy, but a simple \"I will be right with you, thanks so much for your patience\" would have sufficed! Not even asked for anything to drink... I made sure to tell the host (a man in glasses) that we left for this reason. I was really looking forward to eating here."}
{"text":"Wow, everything I want in a breakfast and more.  Staff was really friendly and fun.  Wish there was one of these back in LA!"}
{"text":"Rise & Shine is a fun family restaurant to dine for breakfast or lunch. The servers and hostesses are kind and knowledgeable. They have great novelty items for purchase at the front which are one of the best I've seen at a restaurant. I ordered the chicken fried steak that came with a side of eggs and hash browns. The eggs were done well and the chicken fried steak was flavorful. The only critique I would give is that the breading was a bit chard on the edges."}
{"text":"Not only do they have the best steak and eggs in town they also have the best ice coffee's and fresh juices ! The staff is awesome I try and go every Saturday and the wait time is usually pretty decent 10-15 mins max! The waffle is also beyond amazing !!! Love this place always come back !!!"}
{"text":"I put in a pickup order for a spice rubbed steak chilaquiles and a chicken breast and waffle. Ariel on the phone did not go over pricing with me just told me my food would be done in 20 minutes. When I got to the register to pay, my bill including was $31.58. 15.25 for the chilaquiles and 13.95 for the waffles. The online menu for prices reflecting 12.95 and 11.95. I spoke with Vanessa the manager to see if she would honor the price but said the web designer hasn't updated it. I was told no discount would be given. I paid my tab and off I went. This is bad business. I won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Came for Fathers Day brunch and it was amazing!  The staff is so nice and hospitable. The portions are outrageous. The quality of the food is amazing. I had the Steak & Eggs with Chilaquiles and they were to die for! Anytime in Vegas this will be my new spot."}
{"text":"Quirky and cool breakfast spot we found while on mini vacation. Our AirBnb host recommended. I thought the upside down flower umbrellas were a cute touch and the servers in Pjs was different. We all ordered steak and eggs with cup of bread. Cup of bread had a super cute presentation & was good. But if nuts were added it would have been even better. I asked for medium well steak & all of ours came out very charred...a little too much for me, but my friends liked it. I ordered side of fruit and was unimpressed with size, miniature portion, so I got unimpressive hashbrowns. We sat outside because weather was nice. Worth a try and prices are afforable."}
{"text":"Not going back. My family checked out the menu online and ordered take out. It was their online menu. When the food got home it wasn't what we ordered. I called the restaurant to let them know and the female who answered told me what I saw online wasn't correct. When I let her know they should probably fix that she stated they don't even have prices online. Umm??? Sorry. Not lying, lady. When I pay as much as we did and we overpay and get shorted on the items I expect better customer service. The short stack platter online should come with 4 hotcakes and 2 eggs and bacon. I got 2 cakes and 1 egg and barely cooked bacon. The fullstack online comes with 5 hotcakes for $0.70 more. If they've changed their menu fine. What about that other egg? Why are the pancakes in various sizes and falling apart?Sorry you were busy but if you guys can't provide quality every time why put anything out? So upset we paid so much for what we got."}
{"text":"Great service,  but the food was just ok. For a professed \"steak and egg\" place, they didn't have a t-bone steak meal. Also,  no choices for syrup,  you had to use their house cinnamon syrup if you wanted syrup.  Won't return."}
{"text":"Tasty breakfast, fast service, friendly staff, reasonable price! I'll definitely bring my family in for breakfast  or brunch  when they come to visit me"}
{"text":"Made it in for breakfast today and it was awesome. My servers name was Bruce, he was great and always there when we needed him. I had a waffle and a side of biscuits and gravy, both were delicious. Next time I'm going to try the buffalo chicken dish it sounded amazing. Thanks for everything Bruce we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"OMG!  So good. Pot of bread is fresh, hot, yeasty and cinnamony.  Chicken and waffles are huge. The cinnamon sticks in the warm syrup bottle are a great touch.  Hash browns are wonderful. Very different.  Waitstaff is friendly, attentive and fast.  Hubby had chicken fried steak and eggs. It was a huge plate of food and he said it was great. We are from CA and just passing thru and saw this on yelp and it was so worth the stop."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place to eat breakfast!!!! The food was delious and such amazing customer service Venessa was a great server! The pot of bread is a must try along with the Ultimate Steak & Eggs."}
{"text":"This place is excellent for Breakfast. I'm so glad we stopped by on our way back home to LA. I ordered the Eggs Benedict. My fiancé ordered the Steak Chillaquiles. Everything tasted delicious! I will definitely go back when visiting Las Vegas in the future."}
{"text":"This place was an absolute disgrace to breakfast places everywhere! My husband and kids ate there for my husbands birthday breakfast and the food was just awful .i got the eggs Benedict which used to be my favorite dish until this place singlehandedly ruined it , it was a tough English muffin and the hollandaise was super sour and had way too much lemon in it, not to mention the hash browns we're basically raw and had freezer burn taste to it , they tried to cover it up with an excessive amount of butter . My husband got the country fried steak which was just a piece of thin meat with breading and the breading was very chalky, to call it a country fried steak is giving it too much credit for whatever that mistake was . My kids however liked their food because they are 2 and 3 and giving sugar and pancakes to children is always a success . Long story short , you're over paying for shit food! NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"All I wanted was to place an order for pickup. Someone picked up right away and said it'd b a moment then placed me on hold. I waited for 20 mins then hung up. Why make something so simple so hard? I'm over this place."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! This was our first visit to this place. They have a very open atmosphere that is pretty welcoming. Our server, Vanessa, was very nice and accommodating. I easily will travel across the city from centennial to come here again. 

The menu itself has plenty of options, so naturally i ordered more than one thing
The NY Steak, Spinach and Benedict-Bagel, which was amazing, i finished the whole thing, along with a side order of there Crunchy Cinnamon French Toast. I am basically in a food coma while writing this review. I generally don't eat this much, but i traveled quite a bit just to check out the place so i said what the heck. It was worth the drive. I'll be back again to try more food out."}
{"text":"Huge breakfast portions but very good. You could easily split a dish with someone. We came during a weekday so it wasn't overly busy. Service was great."}
{"text":"Best Chicken and Waffles ever. Huge portions and all homemade. Warm bottle of homemade syrup with Cinnamon sticks in it..  Also tried the Homemade Corn beef hash with the local hot sauce it was also amazing.  Great service!  Menu was overwhelming as we could not make up our minds.. Cute room with flower umbrella fans.. We'll be back to try more of the menu items."}
{"text":"I am a very happy customer.  I went with my daughter and she had the kids waffle and loved it.  I ordered the ribeye steak and eggs over medium and everything was perfect.  There were many large parties with lots of adults and kids and still the service was good.  I love the French press LaVazz coffee too.  The quality of the steak was good and had an excellent flavor.  Cute and clean place! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept but overpriced in today's market. 

Weirdest thing is that the server staff wears PJ's. Yep, same thing people sleep in. Just something about being served by a dude wearing pajamas that is quite unsettling.

For those more tolerant, at least the food is good."}
{"text":"Everything was really great! The peanut butter French toast is a pb&j sandwich, dipped in eggs and cooked up French toast style. Absolutely brilliant! The corned beef hash was made with real beef that did not come out of a can and the pot of bread was just fresh and warm and squishy and wonderful. We sprung for the French press coffee, which was fun, but then we followed up with just some of their regular house brew and it was just as good, if not better than the French press. We waited for over 40 mins on a Saturday morning, so be prepared. I think it was worth the wait though."}
{"text":"Originally I had a draft for this place last month.  This breakfast place in southern highlands has been great for the neighborhood.  The only other closest breakfast place in the area is the griddle on Eastern and IHOP on LV blvd.  Which is crazy busy, because of the tourists.  My original review gave this place 3 stars because the service was very bad and I'm sure it was because they were new.  We have since eaten here 4 times and I have to say that each time has been better service.  The second time we went our waitress never came back to us.  We had another waitress tell us that she would be our new waitress.  I haven't seen that other waitress working there since.  I know I'm focusing on the service on this review, but let's face it.  It's just breakfast food!  I like it because it's close to our house.  
I have to say a little about the food.  I have ordered the ribeye, tenderloins with open face omlet, and the chiliques.  all of these dishes were great.  It's not steak house quality but it's also not steak house price.  My wife always orders the french toast.  She said the french toast is great because it is big texas toast and fluffy.  She makes it a platter with eggs and bacon.  One thing I enjoy about this place is I think they make their own jelly and maple syrup.  My wife also gets the freshly squeezed orange juice.  Overall this breakfast place is a must try!  be prepared to wait for a table on the weekend but at the end it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Outstanding place to have breakfast.  The homemade corned beef hash & eggs was amazing."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure how this place has ANY bad reviews. We've been here several times as we live in the southern highlands area. We LOVE rise & shine! The service and food  have never been anything but amazing! We refer all our friends and family here and have also got nothing but raving reviews from them. Keep doing what you're doing and we'll be forever customers!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed, best steak and eggs in town. Rib eye!!! And chicken and waffles to rival all others. The pot of bread is like a cinnamon roll in a cup. Every single thing on the menu is fantastic. **the summerlin location has bananas foster pancakes- a la mode!"}
{"text":"SOOO GOOD ultimate Ribeye steak. I can really taste the quality and just the right portion for me.  The only thing was the price ($15-still good for a delicious easy to cut-steak) compared to a $7 breakfast steak I've tried before.  

Also...though it was just a small appetizer; the pot of bread with one-of-kind-perfect sauce, was truly appetizing!  

The BYO berrysaucestrawberrypecans parfait wasn't as good."}
{"text":"A breakfast and brunch cafe that has a family-owned feel to it. That's why I prefer going here as opposed to large chain restaurants. The waiters wear pajamas and are super casual. My wait for Sunday at 10am was 15 minutes, so definitely not bad. Menu is extensive, and they're known for their bread in a cup which is essentially a mini cinnamon roll with the sauce on the side for dipping."}
{"text":"Yum! This little place was awesome! We're we're around the corner looking at granite when hunger struck. So I get on Yelp to find this little gem. We were seated right away. Hubby ordered the homemade corn beef hash and I had the turkey, ham and bacon Dijon panini. We were both really happy with our choices. Our waitress was great too. I think that her name was Amber. They all wear pajamas. Cute!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time the other day and I was really disappointed. I had the steak and eggs and French press coffee. The steak I ordered medium plus it was the worst cut of a ribeye I have ever had, all fat and tissue, no meat. The eggs I ordered over medium they came out over hard and the service was uninspired and slow the silverware was dirty. I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"First off, the main reason I took away one star was because it took 20-30 min to get seated. When I walked in there were so many empty tables. If anyone can justify the long wait, I will change my rating, but I don't understand why it would take this long.

BUT, I love how the waitresses are all in their pjs, and there are spinning flower umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. The food was good, I ordered the \"spice rubbed rib eye steak chilaquiles\" which came with a \"pot of bread\" which is similar to a brioche with cinnamon lining the creases. Think cinnabon without being really sweet. The steak was flavorful and tender, eggs were well seasoned and cooked just the way I ordered (over-medium).

I also stole a few bites from my sister's orders - the \"baked blueberry croissant French toast\" was pretty good. It reminded me of bread pudding slathered with super sweet blueberry compote on top, and it comes with extra compote on the side in case it isn't sweet enough for you. My sister gave up after a few bites because of its sweetness and large, overwhelming size.

As for the \"two fisted crispy chicken bagel and egg sandwich\".. it was really large and bland. Needs more seasoning. It came with half a plate of fries which were really good though!"}
{"text":"If you want great food...great service in a \"Mom's & Pop's\" atmosphere...this is definitely the place to come for breakfast!!! 
Try the Steak & Egg white's Benedict...it's AMAZING!! Oh but wait...don't forget to also try the Red Velvet chocolate chip pancakes!! 

Can you say FOOD COMA!?! 

Stop by here and try this place out...food is Bomb.com!! ;)"}
{"text":"First time here, it's busy but food is good.  They are not stingy, food portion is a good size and not like other places where you only see your food in the middle of the plate.  Staffs are friendly, they all wear PJ, makes you feel warmth and cozy."}
{"text":"This is a really nice place to go for breakfast . The food is great , people there r very nice and friendly. I went to breakfast with 2 of my friend there ,for one of their birthday and we really enjoy it."}
{"text":"Back for the chilaquiles. Really, really good. We split the order which was huge and we both had plenty. Like before the pajama crew was great. Looks like they are knocking down a wall for more room. Se ya next time."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes yes yes !!!!!!! Come here and eat breakfast!!!! Food is awesome people are friendly.... got the original pancakes and made it a platter  and the special country fried chicken and biscuit!!!  they keep up on the coffee refills too !"}
{"text":"We were so lucky to have Halle as our server.  Total sweetheart!  She recommended the country fried steak which was perfectly fried.  We also loved the Nutella coffee and had room for a blueberry pancake stack.  This is definitely my new weekend brunch place!"}
{"text":"Cute little local spot. I had the eggs benedict. I've never had a benedict before with balsamic vinegar drizzled on it, I think it could've gone without. Also my potatoes could've been cooked a bit more. Other then that, this place definitely has potential."}
{"text":"Love this place; awesome friendly staff, and food is delish. So wonderful to have a breakfast place like this in SoHi!"}
{"text":"I wanted you to know th experience I had here today. My husband saw this place and we decided to try it. Initial experience was okay nothing great. The waiter came to take the order and instead of seeing if we had any questions with the menu she kept asking if we needed more time like she was in a hurry to walk away. We did so she walked away and went chatting with another employee, I turned over and she was eating fries from a table nearby. What really blows my mind is that a couple walked 20 minutes before closing and she made it a point to mention to them twice that they were closing shortly and would have to order soon. Not only that but before that couple walked in she made a comment to the other female employee about the couple walking in. Needless to say they left without ordering. Again another couple walks in and she again makes a comment. They sit and she makes it a point to let them know they were closing soon. I asked for a tea refill as I was finishing my food and tells me that they are running out and will check what they have left. She then walks over with a full pitcher. The food was decent but the slaw lacked salt and is not comparable to replace fries. I would not recommend this place based on this experience. I hope this does not fall on deaf ears."}
{"text":"GO HERE! Definitely worth the drive a little out of town!! Great service, love the PJs! We had our 4 year old and the food was perfect for him. The coffee was really good! Then came the chicken fried steak and eggs...Goodness, just goodness!! It had depth, and I mean it lifted off the plate! The hash browns actually had flavor and the eggs were fresh! My hubby had really GOOD biscuits and gravy. GO HERE!! I'm considering driving back from CA 9hrs to come here again..haha...seriously"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  We go almost every weekend, the best pancakes I have had in town.  The staff is always friendly, and the service is good.  My husband and I share the little \"pot of bread\" which is fluffy bread w/ a hint of cinnamon and sugar mixed in."}
{"text":"We live nearby so we thought we would give R&S  a try for breakfast @ 10:30 on a Sunday. After a 10 min wait we were seated. My bf commented that the large crowd of patrons and the tight seating arrangements didn't make for a very private or comfortable meal. Half of our tiny table was filled with various condiments. The waitstaff was professional, prompt, and pleasant. The amount of healthy options on the menu was limited. I would say the prices for most items were a bit high. Even though it is close to the house, I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"This is a favorite breakfast place of mine. Service is is quick and friendly, despite always being busy. Coffee is great, fresh squeezed OJ is wonderful.  Get the pot of bread,  you won't be disappointed. I have tried the location on Flamingo a couple of times,  but it was slow and service sub-par and food was not great. This location is the location to go to if you want to enjoy some great food and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a friend and decided to try it. I am glad I did because my fiance and I both agree-that Rise & Shine is outstanding! The staff is very friendly and the food is excellent! We ordered the chilequiles and cinnamon raisin French toast. It was incredible! The chilequiles were very flavorful and the chips were still a little crispy-which we loved! The french toast is huge and sweet, but not overwhelmingly sweet-the perfect amount of cinnamon, crunch, and soft on the inside. Yum!

Can't wait to go back next Sunday! And every Sunday for that matter!"}
{"text":"Thirty Dollars for two people for breakfast is god dam ridiculous. I guess it is my fault for not looking at the menu price. I just never expected the amount to be that high for something we order all over the West coast for usually $9-11.
My wife had Corn Beef Hash. Very small amount that was decent tasting but nothing to let your mom know about.
My Chicken Fried Steak was tender but very greasy. The gravy was your basic gravy. My hash browns tasted like they were old and had been sitting on the grill too long. 
Now what REALLY pissed me off was when I was placing my order I asked for Rye toast and was told that I had to pay extra for that. WHAT? My dam order costs $16 and I have to pay extra for toast. What a load of crap. Of course my for some lame reason my wife whose order came with toast. 
I will never set foot in this place again."}
{"text":"It was my guy's turn to choose a place to eat (yes, e gets a turn ). Intrigued by the name, he chose Rise & Shine - A Steak & Eggs Place. Two of his most favorite things! Score!

I couldn't decide what I wanted & 'everything' wasn't an option, so I let him choose our meals! Haha. We usually end up sharing, anyway 

We got the steak and eggs with hash browns and the breakfast burrito, which was sooooo huge & came with rice, beans, avocado, salsa, & both green and red sauce. 

Everything was absolutely amazing! I want to emphasize again that the burrito was massive. Definitely enough to share. It was also very delicious. The steak was cooked as we asked (medium rare) & it was seasoned very nicely too. As a side, we got the cup-o-bread (I think that's what it's called) & it was warm & fresh. That cream cheese dipping sauce was so yum, I wanted more! 

Food was amazing, service friendly & prompt (love that they're in their pj's too!). Would recommend to friends & visit again when we come back from Hawaii!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast place I've ever eaten at plus great coffee and add-ins as well as a pot of French press! Their steak is cooked perfectly and the bread in a cup is to die for or so I've told."}
{"text":"I have to say, it is nice to have a decent breakfast place in southern highlands finally. it is conveniently located in the middle of southern highlands in the smith's shopping center. it is a quaint little place, with giant sunflowers hanging from the ceiling. the owners of the place are always there and are very very friendly and personable. 

They have a good size menu, lots to choose from. Mostly breakfast fares but there are some sandwiches and entree salads as well. The first time I was there i had the corned beef and hash with eggs. It was homemade corned beef hash with big chunks of beef and potatoes. it was seasoned well and was agood portion of food. i also have tried their egg and ham hollandaise. hand-cut ham on top of english muffin and perfectly poached eggs on top. the hollandaise sauce was a little tangy for my taste but was still excellent. I tried my boyfriend's steak and eggs and the steak was really good. very tender and well seasoned.

their food is really great and they have a special menu coming soon for daily specials like homemade meatloaf and braised short ribs, etc.
overall a great cozy place to have breakfast with excellent service and good quality food.

p.s. the restaurant owners informed me that they chose not to put televisions in their restaurant wc is amazing.. so many places now have tvs and are so distracting. wout them at least u are able to really enjoy the food and company."}
{"text":"I want to emphasize something, dear eateries--cuteness doesn't make up for okay food.  I wanted to like this place a lot, not just for the cow and egg canvas on the wall or the spinning and standstill flower lights overhead.  I wanted to like this place for the simple fact that local eateries should be supported and loved dearly.  Although I love my local places, this one just fell a bit short on taste and overwhelmed me with portion size.  

When you walk in to this place, it's like walking in to a freaky garden turned upside down.  I almost felt like I walked in to the Bug's Life section of California Adventure with the oversizes flowers above my head.  It's cute, though, and has plenty of seating.  The servers are friendly, but they aren't as attentive as they should be.  Although checking on us regularly, when we did want to hail one down it took about three minutes.

My mother and I, after going through the sections of the menu--sandwiches, paninis, waffles, pancakes, specials, omelets, steak, etc.--We landed on two dishes that we felt were different-chilaquiles with salsa avocado and chicken with waffles.  We were excited and couldn't wait for the food to come over.  Thinking it was a regular portion size we even ordered a side of hash browns and bacon.  When the food arrived, however, it was unexpected.  The chilaquiles was actually nachos with eggs on top and half an avocado sliced on top.  IT wasn't that pleasant, although at first it seemed to taste okay.  The chips were soggy and were simply covered in salsa and cheese.  I couldn't see where the chilaquiles part came in at all, to be honest.  The after taste was strong.  The chicken was a breast beat out to what I believe was a chicken fried steak-like thing on top of waffles.  The problem with putting a UFO disc of boneless chicken breast on top of a soft waffle is the oil went in to the waffle a bit, but the heat between the two created condensation that made the waffle soggy.  The chicken was well seasoned, a bit too spicy for just fried chicken, but moist.  The portions, however, were enough to feed 6 people between the two dishes alone.  Still, it was okay.  I do have to emphasize that fried chicken and waffles should be the classic fried chicken pieces with a waffle, but that's just me.

The hash browns weren't pleasant at all to me.  We did order it to have a crispy outside, and I assumed it would be either home fries type of hasbrowns or the typical shredded potato one.  It was..well..like a baked potato was roughly scooped out then patted in to a pancake like hashbrown thing.  They didn't season it either.  I gave it to my husband in a take away box with the leftovers so as not to waste it.  The bacon was nice, though.

Overall, it was okay, and the restaurant is interesting, but I think that there are a few tweaks they need to make.  Then again, I'm one palette against a full restaurant, so maybe I need to try something different next time.  I do like them, and I hope that my next experience in six months will be a more tasty one.  Still, you should try this place for yourself.  In the end, I feel that a cute eatery cannot cover the the fact that it's oversized, just eh food."}
{"text":"Love it here, great food and great service...Fresh squeezed orange juice is FRESH not from a bottle"}
{"text":"CUP O BREAD! Definitely a must. Tried the fried buffalo chicken. It was absolutely great. Everything we tried was delicious. The only downfall was our waitress. She kind of seemed like her head was somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place since our family live close by but it was always so packed that we did not get to try it until today. We wanted to see what the fuss is all about. 

If you go here on the weekends, expect a longer wait time. We waited for a table for around 45 minutes even though we were advised that it will only be a 20-minute wait. When we were finally seated, we were attended to right away. I liked the motif of the interior especially the spinning umbrellas on the ceilings. Our food came out right away, which was great. I ordered the corned beef hash - a classic, how can you mess that up. The flavor is better than most breakfast places that I have tried but I do not like the texture. It was chopped ham with onions and mashed potatoes (supposedly hash brown). It was a little disappointing. Everything else that we ordered were meh. Nothing really stands out. The waffle was too doughy. The orange juice tasted like it was not freshly juiced and it was a little sweet like it was mixed with concentrate (this is just my guess). 

I would still recommend this place. I might come back and give it a second opinion, maybe try their steak and eggs or their pancakes. I think since Rise and Shine is really the ONLY breakfast place in the area (I mean you can get breakfast food at The Lodge except it's a bar), a lot of people would be willing to wait for a table here. I personally think it was not worth the wait. They need to open more breakfast places in this side of town."}
{"text":"I find the food in this restaurant to be some of best in this price range. The casual atmosphere is enhanced by the fact that the wait staff all wear pajamas. It's a cute touch.

We always make a point to order at least one pot of bread, because they're fantastic. Of all of the breakfast restaurants in Las Vegas, this one of my favorites.

The only negative thing I can say is that the biscuits and gravy are a little too spicy for my taste."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review before I get my food as I can already tell it will be awesome. It was super busy but they still managed to seat us right away. Love that the servers wear pajamas. Yelp is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Very fortunate to live pretty much next door to one of the best breakfast spots in Vegas. The servers are all in their pyjamas which adds a fun and upbeat atmosphere. Not to mention the classic Christmas songs playing which made my breakfast even more merry. I chose to go for the cinnamon crunch french toast....it is unreal! Price is very good and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! 
The staff also wears their PJs which makes you feel like you're right at home getting a home cooked breakfast!"}
{"text":"They serve you while in their pajamas!!!

One little quirk that I found endearing was the fact that the servers here run around in their pajamas while taking your order and serving you. Nice little gesture to make you feel at ease and that you don't have to take things too seriously.

We arrived and were told that the omelets are great, the Pot'o'Bread is THE BEST, and that the steak n eggs are pretty bomb. 

Well, what was told is pretty much truth. I got a pretty hefty and filling omelet, the wife got the steak n eggs, and we all got Pots o Bread.

Now I have to say - the PoBs were a little underwhelming. Really cool concept, fun little quirk to have as a staple of your establishment... but too me, there wasn't enough cinnamon and there wasn't quite enough flavor. But still! The texture was great and it was really fun to enjoy.

The servings are all pretty big as both the lady and I had to take our food to go [and I'm a pretty hefty eater]. The steak that she got was more fatty than we'd prefer, but there was still a substantial enough amount of meat for us to enjoy.

The service here is great, everyone is friendly, and you feel very welcomed to enjoy a good time at Rise & Shine. Not bad, you guys, not bad at all.

Come here if you want something off the strip, not nearly as noisy, and a good time."}
{"text":"Very cute atmosphere, especially for a strip mall establishment. I was really impressed with the decor and attention to detail on all of the styling.  The flower umbrellas hanging from the ceiling and tile framed windows made the setting more whimsical than industrial. The waitresses all had on pajama style uniforms which was a nice added touch. (Though I also have to mention the owner was working the cash register but didn't make much of an effort to make an impression with customers). 

The food was very good - we ordered the chiliquilas and steak along with the Belgium waffles. We also got the French press coffee which is served at the table with a timer for the perfect cup. 

So why only 3 stars?  This place was good but a little expensive and they charge extra for everything! In fact, a whole column of the menu has the run down on these charges... But these items arent really \"sides\" -- unless you usually eat avocado by itself?  Also, $4 for bacon?  I got my breakfast with steak for only $3 more than the chiliquilas by themselves so I'm not sure about the math on this one. Bottom line, this place is a little out of the way, nestled in a neighborhood strip mall, and could do better on the pricing for what it is... So, I have to conclude by saying this place is probably best left to the locals."}
{"text":"The place has a good morning feel to it. The staff was really friendly, and overall nice. The food that I order came out in a good amount of time. I tried the country fried chicken and waffle. By far one of the best combinations I had and it tasted very good. I would recommend to check this place out."}
{"text":"Fast, low wait times and AMAZING orange juice! When I say amazing it's understated.  Seriously, go try it.  Oh and the food is awesome as well."}
{"text":"What a fun place! Instead of toast or English muffin, you HAVE to have the \"Bowl of Bread\", a yummy cinnamon roll baked in an espresso cup served with cream cheese topping on the side. Then came my breakfast with perfectly cooked over-medium eggs. I don't get them perfectly cooked very often but this place is meticulous. My husband ordered the Asada Burrito which was perfect! The homemade refried beans are yummy as well. Writing this review...I want to go again but I'm 5 hours away. Next time I'm in Las Vegas..."}
{"text":"Maybe I missed something. Or, maybe I just ordered the wrong food but Rise & Shine was not all that to me...at all. 

I arrived around 11am and it was busy. I drove here from Lake Las Vegas so when I was told the pot of breads were all gone, I was definitely disappointed. 

I had some coffee to start which was actually a good cup of joe. My waitress was really busy and I was in a really patient mood so it was all good. She finally came to
take our order. I ordered the Ultimate Steak breakfast which consisted steak (obviously), 2 eggs, hash browns and my choice of bread (except the pot of bread).

I ordered my steak medium but it came more well then anything. We waited about 20 minutes or more for our food so I decided to keep it. First off, this rib-eye was super thin. I have never had a rib-eye steak that was so thin. 

I ordered my eggs over medium. The yolk portion was perfect but the eggs were a little too brown on the outside and they were more yolk than egg white. It was like two big eyeballs on my plate. Not sure what happened to the egg white portion. 

My hashbrowns were okay but like most everything else on the plate, it was cold. 

NOTE TO RESTAURANT: Why is the air up so high. My food was cold in a few minutes.

I saw some other plates going by that looked pretty good but my food was not up to par. I would say it  was okay, so I won't be back."}
{"text":"It was good.  I live 1/2 a mile away so after reading the reviews I had to check it out.  Yep the servers wear PJs.  They look good too.  My server was A+ she explained the menu very well.  I had a nice three egg breakfast with the smoky bacon and hash browns.  Maybe not the best I've ever had but very good and their coffee is terrific."}
{"text":"The food and the reviews are what pulled me into this place. My husband ordered soda to drink and it tasted very flat ordered a second choice and that too was flat, thinking the food was going to taste better we went for the rise and shine chilaquiles and steak burrito. Not only did 5 customers that came after us got their food before us but the food was okay, I really wanted to like this place but the food was a 5 out 10 just like the customer service."}
{"text":"Refreshing change of pace over all the other local breakfast spots!

The decor, atmosphere, service, and food are all top notch.  You'll read many reviews raving about the flower pots of bread and their Chilaquiles and Steak and you definitely won't be dissapointed.

This is definitely my new favorite breakfast spot and you just get a much more alive vibe than the Egg Works, Egg and I, Pancake House, and other breakfast competitors.

These reviews are spot on about the quality of service and food.  This place is truly a gem and you should definiltely check it out!"}
{"text":"They know what they're doing and they're doing it right! Amazing steak! I had the chilaquiles and ribeye. Both amazing. The chilaquiles aren't authentic Mexican but they are still good! The parfait is also amazing. I will come every time I visit Las Vegas! 

My husband also had the cinnamon raisin French toast with bacon. He struggled finishing it but had to because it was so delicious. Also, don't forget to get some French pressed coffee. Will be purchasing a French press after this."}
{"text":"French press! I'm in love.
This eatery is not close to where I live, so to come here is not convenient and I need to have a very good reason. French press is good, but not something to drive across town for. I have been here twice and had a very good experience the first time, but a not so good one the second time. Service and food were on point the first time, which brought me to the second visit... that kind of just fell flat. I might return if I am on that side of town."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! I wanted to take my son and grandson to a new place for breakfast. Such a waste of money and time. First I have to say the restaurant itself is cute. I loved the umbrellas on the ceiling. Very unique and adorable. That's the only thing I could say I actually liked. 

The service was the worst I've ever had and I mean worst!!! As soon as we were greeted by the server (christine) we felt her negative vibe. You could tell she didn't want to be there. She even rolled her eyes and started looking around the restaurant while we were taking to her. I was really hoping my son wouldn't notice because he's super picky about customer service. As soon we'll she walked away he's like \"Did you see that\"!!! Unfortunately I did. Not once did she not ask us on how our food was. When they (her and another server) dropped our food she didn't even ask if we needed anything else. My son waited 10 minutes after our food was served to get sour cream. He tried getting her attention....She looked right at him and walked away. Finally he just got up and went to go ask the cooks for the sour cream. 

The food was not worth the $44.00 we spent. I had the red velvet pancakes with a side of eggs and bacon. I specifically asked the server to make the bacon well done. Didn't happen. The pancakes were hard and crispy. Really pancakes crispy!? Ugh. My son had the steak omelette I think. He said it was ok but not worth the money. 

All in all I would never go back to this establishment. The service alone killed it for us. Then to have mediocre food ugh. Honestly there's so many good places in Vegas to eat breakfast... believe me I'm a native and have been to plenty. Try somewhere else!"}
{"text":"My friend was visiting from out of town and we are both fans of Steak & Eggs, so we decided to give this place a go. We went on a busy Saturday morning, the weekend of thanksgiving, it was packed but we were seated in a timely manner. Service was good for how busy it was. The steak was alright and the eggs were, well....eggs. You get a choice of toast, biscuit or a cinnamon roll in a mug (bomb). I was a fan of their coffee and the ambiance of the restaurant is nice."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places. Recently they expanded their dining area and changed their menu. It's clear that even though they expanded their dining area by a lot they didn't expand their kitchen. The last time we were there we waited 45 minutes for our food. I ordered 1 soup and my boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffle. Really? It was a very small order and zero reason for waiting that long. 
Also, they removed my favorite lunch combo (soup and southwestern chicken salad) They no longer have the soup and salad combo and they no longer have the Onion Soup or the Southwestern Chicken salad. They also removed the delicious Pot of Bread from (at the very least) the Chicken and Waffle. 
You simply shouldn't remove items that accompanied entrees in the past. If you want to remove an entree fine but removing an accompanying item gives a bad experience. 

I will not be frequenting this place as I did before. 
We used to go almost every weekend and there's zero loyalty, they simply wouldn't budge and wouldn't allow me to order a soup and salad. I'll be taking my business elsewhere.  

This is is exactly how businesses fail. Poor management."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to eat here for months! With quite an appetite I had high hopes for the food here but my experience was off. The poached egg tasted really weird and lost all the egg taste and texture. The steak was unseasoned and the hash browns were meh. Even the plain bagel it came with was terrible. I've never found a bagel I didn't like until this place. The pancakes were ok. It was a little weird of how crumbly they were though.

Sometimes when you are hungry enough even average food tastes awesome but it didn't work here. Almost everything was terrible."}
{"text":"This place is off the strip in a plaza with other restaurants and eateries. 
We waited a while to get seated and for the food to come. 
Our waitress was nice, but did not write down our requests, so as a result got a lot of our items wrong. We had five people with somewhat specific requests, so it is better to write it down. Usually they do at restaurants I go to. We did not want to send back our items as it would take even longer to get the right items. 
The restaurant is not too fancy. Not too new. Reminds me of a Denny's. The price isn't great either, same as strip prices just about. I thought going off the strip is supposed to be cheaper.
Their most unique item is the bread in a cup. It's bread baked into a cup. That was really good. Fluffy and flavorful. 
I got the omelette with fruit, avocados, and hash browns. Nothing special. Just a regular breakfast. Won't return. Will stick to the strip next time. Closer and cleaner!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken and waffle and it did not disappoint! My only regret is not being able to finish it all. I also had the bread in a bowl and it was to die for. Like monkey bread but not as sweet and gooey and just as good."}
{"text":"We had never been here before and went off reviews on yelp and decided to try it. We had a great breakfast, the staff were very friendly and the service was good!"}
{"text":"I think the egg and I have some competition when it comes to breakfast. I love trying brand new restaurants and just having so much anticipation on how the place will turn out. 
Located in the southern highlands neighborhood in the smiths grocery plaza. We had a 15 min wait, pretty packed obviously this was brunch for us, got there at 1pm on a Saturday. Friendly staff and excellent food! Hugh portions, food came in hot. We started with the \"bread in a cup\" that was so yummy it had a cinnamon roll like texture! I had the steak and eggs chilaquiles, steak was a pretty good size and a perfect medium rare. Chicken and waffles were yummy too! Best piece of chicken I've tasted in awhile. Large piece deep fried crunchy coated chicken breast. This place does breakfast right. I'm assuming this is family owned which is great because they really care about the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh!!! This place is soooo amazing! I wish I lived in Vegas! The concept of the whole place is so neat! I had the chicken waffle and omg it was sooooo good! The red valvet pancakes were amazing as well. I love how the servers were in their pajamas and sleeping slippers. This place is a must if you're in town. It's going to be my stop whenever I'm in the neighborhood! Yummy yummy!"}
{"text":"The wait was 20-25 minutes when we came at 9:45 on a Sunday morning.  Well worth it.

We had chicken & waffles- very good, very crispy, and the syrup came warm.  Also country fried steak and eggs- excellent!  Huge, crispy, and with a little bit of a spicy kick.  I personally got the pancakes, and took the server's advice to ask for the blueberries cooked inside.  Loved!  It was fresh, flavorful berries, and a generous amount.

Best of all, everyone in my family loved breakfast, from baby to grandma.  Take it from me- this bunch is hard to please."}
{"text":"Finally found a breakfast place that we love!! My husband and I just want to say that everything from the service to the food was amazing!! Laura our server took such great care of us! She was so funny and even though she seemed to have quite a few tables our food came out quick and she still made time to chat. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We've been to the Southern Highland Rise & Shine and loves the open atmosphere. The food is great so when we found out there was one open in Henderson, we had to come and try.

This one is smaller, a little bit more closed in, and has been just open for a month. Service was good, but not fabulous. Just seem like you have to constantly ask for things like water, napkins, straws, and etc.
I ordered a cappuccino and I got whip and caramel on top thinking it comes with it. However, I found out they charge 95cents extra. Everything is ala carte here. Food was yummy except for one dish. The Loco Moco. They served it with day old rice and hard rice from the bottom of the pot. Ground beef was burnt. The waitress took it back and they brought it back with the same rice with a different patty with no eggs. By the time we got it back, everyone was done with their meal and nothing was solved. I could have chipped a tooth with the rice it came with. Waitress was apologetic and took off the check. The thing is, one person went out still hungry with an overpriced check.

Therefore, I don't think I will go back to this one because it was the manager that still approved for the meal to go out the same way the second time. Horrible. This is my reason I gave this place three stars. Or if you still go, don't get the Loco Moco!"}
{"text":"Nice yummy place to have breakfast! Awesome service as well! Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"I gave them a 2 stars only because they do not have any kind of vegan option they do not carry any other milk but cows milk.  On the positive side the service is great and it feels like a neighborhood dinner"}
{"text":"Coffee, amazing. Red velvet pancakes with cream cheese syrup, bomb. Burritos, huge."}
{"text":"Great service! Super-cute place and great food! My daughter loved the red velvet pancakes! The cream cheese syrup is incredible!"}
{"text":"steak was cooked perfectly, but was so overseasoned that it just blended with the plate.  the plate i ordered was the chilaquiles, which is basically a plate of savories.  the steak alone was probably the only saving grace.  the chilaquiles were ok.  the sauce was a little acidic but then again, it's chilaquiles.  i ordered my eggs poached, and they clearly were made with the kitchen trick of adding a drop of vinegar so the whites stay intact.  well, these eggs just tasted sour, like vinegar and SMELLED of vinegar too.  

for the money (think, a whole 6 oz steak), the entire dish, and not just the steak should be amazing."}
{"text":"Stunned. So good. Tried the chilaqilues, b & g, and cinnamon crumble French toast. French press coffee: do it. My favorite thing though? Probably the hash browns. Best I've ever had."}
{"text":"it was alright, no booze so its no longer my go to place but the food was alright and the staff was nice, the smoothies are great."}
{"text":"Read reviews and since I'm new to the neighborhood wanted to check it out.  We were seated right away but, waited a little too long for drink order.  Waitress was very nice.  Ordered country fried steak and eggs. $15.25.  Generous portion but hash browns were burnt.  Steak was bland. I was a little disappointed based on reviews. No bread came with meal. $3 for ice tea that was refilled.  Gonna have to push myself for a second time"}
{"text":"This place is on my go-to list for breakfast and brunch any day. After a few times here, I have come to find their service is plenty attentive and their food is always tasty and fresh.

Absolutely love seeing servers dressed in pajamas. The wall/ceiling decorations are also fantastic and add to the overall inviting feel of the restaurant. I love the fresh squeezed orange juice. Not to mention their french press coffee and their super delicious hash browns. I have had the chicken and waffles, eggs benedict, and french toast for breakfast so far and have nothing but good things to say about all of it.

There is a unique and charming flare to this restaurant that we don't see much of in Vegas and it's that rare quality that keeps me going back. Thinking about it, there is really no breakfast joint here that I can even compare this place to and that says quite a lot to me. They may get a little busy at times, but Rise & Shine is certainly worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. The atmosphere was cool, our server named Vanessa was really good and knew exactly what she was doing and was very attentive. The guy back in the kitchen was fast and made excellent meals. They had a wide variety on their menu and had good coffee. I ordered the avo-veg eggs Benedict and wow it was awesome. Great place! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, friendly staff, good food. Had the Ultimate Ribeye Steak and eggs and it was good. Not flavorful enough to be memorable but good. I will return to try other items on their menu. There are lots of varieties and portions are large. The Green Go Go drink was refreshing and delicious with a naturally light taste. The French toast is fluffy and well made also. I am excited for my next visit!"}
{"text":"I had the Chilaquiles with the steak. Either I was really hungry or the food was really good.  Best breakfast I've had in quite some time.....eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Oh, how I love chicken and waffles! After seeing the pictures, I had to go! Like almost everyone else, this place is really far from us in the NW but it was well worth the drive. It is kinda small and we went for brunch but I'm guessing during breakfast, you may have to wait a bit.

Of course I got the chicken and waffles...and it's one of the best versions I've had in Vegas! Even though I usually prefer bone-in breasts, they give you two huge boneless breasts that were excellent! The chicken itself is fried perfectly, crispy on the outside and super moist inside. Killer seasoning on the chicken too, it's not overly salty and even had a slight bit of spicy kick in it. The Belgian waffle was delicious, super moist, fluffy and they bring out a bunch of butter and warm syrup with the plate. My wife had the biscuits and gravy which she's normally really picky with but she loved it.

We really liked this place but I think there prices are too high. The chicken and waffles is $13 which is a huge plate but the biscuits and gravy was kinda small portion-wise and was $10. They also charge $2.50 for HALF an avocado which is ridiculous. The waitresses dressed in pajamas was a nice touch and ours was really nice. Other than pricing, we loved the food and would come back in a hearbeat!"}
{"text":"So this is my second visit.  Had the corned beef hash both times, first time service was ok, not the most attentive but adequate.  This time around the corned beef was not as good as the first time: this time it seemed like more potato than meat which is disappointing.  So may not come back for corned beef next time.  My party seemed to enjoy their food the most part, the chicken fried steak my sister in law had was very fatty and far too breaded.  Service this time was pretty bad, never checked how our food was, never bothered to see if we needed more beverages till we had to ask.  I asked for more water and only half the table got water...  So service is really lacking.  We were also very bothered that not just w our table but the table next to us when we were still eating or had food on our plate.  It was a clear ploy to get us going since they are backed up on a wait, but never rush your guests... Bad form.  Sure other people are giving 5 stars but I'm wondering they are being objective.  This place has some improvements to had if we are to come back."}
{"text":"I just had breakfast here. There was a 10 minute wait, so worth it. Made my own omelette. Comes with hash browns and your choice of bread. I got the bread in a cup which is delicious. Everything was sooooo good and well seasoned. I ordered a French press coffee, very good and makes 3 cups. Atmosphere is lively and family friendly. Customer service was great. Will definitely be back to try other stuff."}
{"text":"Waitstaff...awesome. 
Food...excellent. Great selection and all steak (even if you get steak in your burrito) is cooked to order. 
Only downside...not a big enough place...if there were more tables, we wouldn't have to wait as long on weekend mornings!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went yesterday morning for breakfast on our anniversary. The food was amazing although I did have to wait on my cream cheese syrup for about ten minutes after I received my pancakes so they were a bit cold when I finally got to eat them. The only real complaint I have is that our server a guy wasn't very friendly but the lady with glasses was amazing and picked up his slack"}
{"text":"The food was great and I wish I could give them 5 stars.  Unfortunately the juice bar guy is enough reason to NEVER return. As I sat facing his direction, I observed him cleaning the oj machine with scrubbing pads and kitchen rags, WITH JUICE IN THE CONTAINER, that was being served in the process. I was appalled. Then he continued his health code violations by eating with latex gloves over the the prep area in view of the entire restaurant. This man should be fired!!!!!"}
{"text":"Got here at 9:30 am on a Sunday morning and this place was packed! 

Service was good since we got a table right away. The waitress in her PJs was pretty attentive too.

I ordered a ham egg Benedict and it was good! The hash browns just needed a tad more seasoning. My bf ordered a ham steak that came with a strand of HAIR! I immediately noticed it while the waitress was serving it. I mentioned it to her right away and took the plate back and replaced it with a fresh new plate. The ham was pretty good too. It was not dry and you can taste a bit of the char from the grill. 

I especially loved their pot of bread. The presentation was something different (bread in a plant pot). The bread was so soft with a hint of cinnamon. Delish! 

All in all even with the hair experience, it was not bad and will be back here."}
{"text":"Consistently great breakfast, I've tried almost everything on the menu. There still hasn't been a disappointment. The size of the dishes is far more than most breakfast places. I never leave hungry."}
{"text":"Found this place via yelp reviews and tried for brunch... Not disappointed! Had to wait a bit but well worth it and it just reassured that we chose a good place. 

Food is reasonably priced and tastes great! Service was also good- friendly staff and refilled our waters/coffee multiple times. Only thing I would say is that I got an omelette with steak and some of my steak pieces were fatty- therefore I was unable to eat all of it.

Will definitely come again though- and recommend for anyone looking for a cute, local and cheap breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Tried this place based on their reviews and glad I did. The portions were generous, the food was tasty, and the waitress kept my coffee cup filled and was great about offering pointers on what to order.  Did I mention they have real maple syrup? 
Bread in a cup and red velvet chocolate chip pancakes are a must."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here over the Thanksgiving break.  Of course I ordered the country fried steak and eggs and I was not disappointed.  It is the best I've ever had!  The meat is really tender and moist and the batter is nice and crispy.  You can't get any better.  Next time I'm in Las Vegas, I will be coming here."}
{"text":"This place hits the spot... Even ran into 3 people from Utah where were from. Just ask the server what's good and you will be fine. Vanessa was awesome and her recommendation of the the buffalo chicken breakfast was right on the money. Put a little syrup on top of the buffalo sauce and I was in heaven."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!  The pancakes are to die for!  The omelet and hash browns are also delicious.  We also tried the oatmeal and that was served beautifully and tasted great.  The service is great, the coffee is yummy, and all breakfast items seem to be delicious.  We are so excited to have this place in our neighborhood.  We hope to check out the lunch menu soon, too.  My husband's only complaint is that there are no newspapers to read and not a newspaper stand nearby.  

Definitely go early on the weekends, or bring a newspaper and read it while you wait for a table."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 5 times since my first review. It's still my favorite breakfast spot in South Las Vegas. The coffee is really good and the steak and chilaquiles is still my favorite dish. I've since tried the corned beef hash among other dishes and was quite impressed. 

I think the potted bread as a side should be a little cheaper. I also think the wait staff is better than before but still needs a sense of urgency when moving around the restaurant. There's one brunette woman who I like a lot but some of the other servers seem less than alert. I'd like to see a bigger team effort when it comes to the service. There's nothing more frustrating when you see other servers standing around and my coffee cup is empty."}
{"text":"I joined a friend here for a late breakfast while visiting Las Vegas and it will now be one of my regular stops when I am in town.  The staff here wear pajamas.  So cute! Very cozy and unique.

Pros:  great location, near South Point Casino, delicious omelette, great coffee, excellent service.

Cons:  Located in Vegas and I live in San Antonio."}
{"text":"Amazing place to grab a protein filled breakfast.

I ordered the spice rubbed ribeye with the chiliquilles. The ribeye came out super tender and charred nicely. The Nachos on the side with the refried beans, cheese, and egg works so good with the steak. 

This location is the best one I have been to in regards to the service which was top notch the entire time we was in the resturant. 

We also ordered the country ham steak which was a little on the mediocre side. Do your self a favor and stick with the staple this place does. Get da steak and eggs!!!"}
{"text":"GET THE 'CUP OF BREAD'!!!! My oh my what a way to start off breakfast. Food was excellent. Rib eye and eggs perfect, coffee very fresh and best part is the atmosphere. Definitely as good as the food. Servers don their pajamas, down to earth and friendly. Worth a half hour wait."}
{"text":"First time visit and it won't be the last! Had the lox and cream cheese omelet which was a surprise since I wasn't expecting all the extras in it, capers, spinach, onion and I had avocado instead of potatoes which has never been an option in any breakfast spot I've gone to unless you pay extra for it. You'll have to try the cinnamon roll instead of toast, it has a cup of the frosting on the side to dip it in after its pulled apart out of a tea cup that it's baked in, a yummy pre breakfast treat!! The decor is cheery as there are umbrellas in the ceiling that spin and the wait staff wears pajamas."}
{"text":"I eat here often but this time made me write a review. I am a Chef, i am writing this because its probably the best breakfast I've had from here yet. I ordered the Country Fried Steak which is normal for me but to start the portion size is well worth the money you pay for it. Second it was seasoned so perfectly every time i took a bite it honestly left my taste buds jumping for more. Kudos to the Cook that made it for me i will be only ordering it when you are on shift now because i don't want it any other way. Thank you for an amazing meal and service from the FOH staff keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Their food was great and I loved the cleverness of them wearing PJ's! My kids enjoyed and I will be back!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Rise & Shine. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with vibrant colors, open windows, exposed brick, and high ceilings. Very clean and open + cute pajama uniforms for the staff that made it feel like you were having breakfast at home! Their menu was diverse, and they serve fresh juice. Upon arrival to our table, our server, Ashley was attentive, personable, intentional, and her customer service was A+. I got my go-to favorite kind of breakfast: rice, spam, and egg over medium. This wasn't offered on the menu, but I was comfortable enough to ask Ashley it was possible and without hesitation she said, \"of course!\" Overall extremely satisfied with my food, and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent service. Wish it was a bigger location, not much room for waiting."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for brunch and you seriously do not have to worry if you just rolled out of bed, even the servers are in pajamas! They have cute overhead umbrella flowers, and the rest of the decor is really homefeel like. 

Our server was really friendly, but a tad slow on bringing back our drinks when the restaurant was not busy. She asked to refill coffee a few times and checked back with us with a smile on. 

I ordered the Ham N Eggs Benedict which was very appetizing to look at, who doesn't eat with their eyes first? The ham to English muffin ratio was perfect and the hollandaise sauce was smooth and rich. The hash browns were more on the crispy side,which I prefer. Overall it was a great tasting meal. I would definitely order it again. 

I recommend to definitely get the pot of bread, if your meal does not come with it. It's like a less sweeter version of a cinnamon bun in a cup. It was delicious. Just thinking about it makes me salivate. Honestly this bread along with another side choice, & a cup of coffee would be a perfect light breakfast.

It's a little ways out of the main city/strip but definitely worth it for some good old comfort food."}
{"text":"This Place is delicious! My GF and I both got the Chilaquiles Steak and Eggs and by far that is some of the best steak I have had out to eat in quite a while. Staff is friendly and attentive and Management is GREAT. Towards the end of our meal Steve Bell came and introduced himself and asked us how our meal was. This restaurant has some of the best food and customer service in town, you will not be disappointed!! We will for sure be back!!!"}
{"text":"One of my go to places for breakfast spots because we live right down the street for it. Always a wait when you come so you know it's going to be good. Takes about 5 mins to be seated if not less and they make sure to get you started right away. The staff is in pjs and it's really cute.

Started off with their coffee and some pot of bread which is what they are known for. So good. For my meal I had one of their bagel sandwiches and it had egg cheese and sausage, can't complain it was good! My sister had a parfait, once again yummy. My boyfriend had the steak huevos rancheros and it looked amazing!

They are really speedy with their service and it's also really good food. Every time I get something different and I have no problems. Greta restaurant great food."}
{"text":"I would like to start off saying that me and my roomie showed up in onesies. This place is adorable and probably the best place in town to eat breakfast hands down."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this place and I have to give it five huge stars! I ordered pickup and stopped in the place is really cute and the people are really friendly. Even the pickup order after driving home was still the bomb! Fresh, plenty of food and so flavorful. Me and the hubs got the three little pigs bagel and the steak chilaquiles...they both were really good! Definitely the new breakfast spot for us!!!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was fabulous.. Maria our waitress was wonderful, she explained the menu and their items to us, which was helpful since it's a lengthy menu.. lots of delicious choices!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute. I love the umbrella flowers spinning about the ceiling. I love how the servers wear pajamas! Super cute. The service was great. I ordered the country fried steak it was pretty good with the gravy on the side. Only downside it was breaded a little too much to my liking. I also tried a side of the red velvet pancakes to compare with the ones at BabyStacks Cafe. I'm sorry it just doesn't cut it. These pancakes did not even look RED, it looked more like a burned pancake. It was also too chocolatey inside. The cream cheese syrup was too thick and too sweet. I guess I'll have to go to BabyStacks for my red velvet fix. Other than that I enjoyed my main dish. I also ordered the steak chilaquiles for my boyfriend togo and that looked delicious. He enjoyed it! I would like to come back and try their other breakfast items."}
{"text":"Update: They raised the prices which is unbelievable considering very few items are made from scratch. It's all add water mixes for the pancakes and the egg whites are from a container not separated eggs. The omelette was over cooked to make matters worse. I'm so over this place especially since my two favorite servers have left. The remaining staff seems miserable and it makes one wonder why. On to other places for us. 


My husband and I frequent Rise n Shine at this location. Our first experience was made phenomenal by our server, Christine! We love her and request her whenever we go. She is very attentive and professional. I think the prices are high but I don't mind paying a bit more for the great service we receive from Christine. I can't imagine anyone feeling a negative vibe from her, she is always cheerful and funny. 
I love the waffles! The caramel coffee is delicious and I don't have to order when I go in, Christine knows what I'm ordering. Lol. Go on in and ask for her!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best breakfast places! Delicious food and fun atmosphere. Servers in pj's and \"pot of bread\" cinnamon rolls are a great touch. Try the \"cinnamon toast crunch French toast\"!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience and the absolute best breakfast we have have ever had! My daughter Paris says they should put a Rise & Shine in EVERY city; then she said every corner.

I had a bacon, egg and ham omelet with hash browns and a bread cup (espresso cup filled with warm cinnamon bread). The omelet was perfect and the hash browns had this amazing taste where you knew spices were involved. 

Paris had bacon wrapped steak. Also amazing. We'll be back on every trip!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place!! The food here was Stellar and it had such a fun happy vibe to it. The decor just made me smile and all the servers wear PJs! I ordered the double fisted bagel sandwich with hash browns and it did not disappoint. Service was on point, will be visiting next time I visit Vegas !"}
{"text":"First time here. It did not disappoint. Great service and I love that the waitstaff wear pajamas. The menu has everything you can imagine for breakfast, and Some unusual ones as well. I will definitely come here again. If you're in or around Southern Highlands I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Holy Moly
Drop your forks, we all know there's only a few breakfast restaurants in Mountains Edge / Southern Highlands. Don't waste your time at any other than Rise & Shine!
The food is Phenomenal! Seriously staff usually doesn't make or break a place for me but this staff was sooo on point! Including their adorable pajamas. The chefs were voice full which made that busy kitchen run smooth.But the food the food was the knockout!! Rubbed steak & chilaquiles was Masterful!! The flavor was bursting the authentic flavors I haven't had since being in Mexico!
Great Job guys! You have a weekly guest now and I couldn't be more ecstatic about Breakfast Time!!"}
{"text":"Talk about big portions.  I couldn't even eat half of my plate.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy.  It was delicious!  If you love coffee you must try the french pressed coffee!! The service was okay, the women was really nice, but we felt a little rushed.  Other than that I would recommended trying this place out for breakfast."}
{"text":"So many times w come here and the food is great. Blueberry pancakes, avocado eg sandwich and chicken wrap all super tasty. Great service."}
{"text":"The service was great, our waiter had a great sense of humor and was sufficient at his job. We went on Wednesday so not to busy at all. The cup of bread was delecious! The most I had was just an omlet nothing fancy. It was slightly overpriced but overall a great new place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Cup o bread and ok is a must!!! Very cute place and great food!! Eggs Benedict was delicious"}
{"text":"Good food and nice seevice. The juices are great too. The chilaquiles are my favorite so far. Yum!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast place, really cute atmosphere! 3 stars because service is hit and miss & food inconsistent."}
{"text":"In my opinion you really can't mess up an egg, this was the case here. The eggs were done right, the hash browns were fresh and the bacon was perfect. Oh, they have these little cups of cinnamon roll heaven. The atmosphere, cleanliness and service was great. The food was hot, and the coffee strong.
Yes, you should give the small out of the way breakfast place a try!"}
{"text":"I Was Tipped Off About This Amazing Breakfast Spot By A Friend Of Mine. I Looked It Up On Yelp And Found All Of The Good Reviews. Me And My Wife Went And It Was AMAZEBALLZ. Our Server Cary Was Very Helpful And An Amazing Waitress. I love when you go to a new spot and they know how to help you choose the right meal. My wife got the county fried steak and I got the rib-eye. Everything was killer and I would tell anyone in the area this is a must eatery."}
{"text":"Breakfast being my favorite meal of the day - I had to try this new spot in Green Valley. Upon entering I was greeted and sat quickly. After 5 minutes of not being approached by a server, I asked a hostess for a cup of coffee and to find my server. Server appeared a few minutes later with my cup of coffee. He apologized and said they were short handed and they are still trying to work the kinks out of a new restaurant. 

Servers are  inexperienced and move very slow. If I could offer one tip for the servers that would be to treat your section as one big table vs. 4 or 5 individual tables. Stop making a trip into the kitchen each time you leave a table. Stop, make eye contact with your customers to see if they need anything before disappearing.

I found the coffee and the food to be much better than the service. Hash browns were crisp on the outside and flavorful inside. The ham steak was thick and juicy. The eggs cooked perfectly. I opted for the cup of bread instead of my usual wheat toast. The cup of bread is a bland cinnamon roll with frosting on the side. I think this would be good as an appetizer but didn't care eating it with my breakfast. 

The prices here are crazy expensive for a neighborhood breakfast restaurant. My bill worked out to be $20/person with tip. 

I would come back here for the food, but not very often because of the service and the price."}
{"text":"Staff is very attentive and friendly. Great breakfast and environment. Place was pretty cold since we were one of the few first ones in on an expected hot day in Vegas. I had one of my breakfast faves - chicken fried steak and eggs. The hash browns, gravy, steak and eggs came out perfect. I'm very satisfied with my experience bring it's my first time eating in the area."}
{"text":"went back a few times.   Food is still delicious and the chicken and waffles are always a winner.
I also enjoyed the bagel egg sandwiches, and the burgers.

It is cool seeing the waiters wearing PJs."}
{"text":"Fast service, delicious healthy food, and friendly staff! Waitresses are dressed in pj, which makes you feel like home. The design of the restaurant is cute too:)"}
{"text":"I'm so sad they're not in the San Fernando valley. I absolutely love this place and I only had one meal. I don't care about ihop, Denny's, norms, or cocos or really any breakfast place. This is my number one! My dad and I were disappointed they discontinued corn beef hash at ihop, but this place oh my god!! I swear it's like butter! Like I can taste the butter in the corn beef hash. If I could I would refuse every mashed potato meal/side and just have the corn beef hash from Rise and Shine."}
{"text":"I had a wild craving for some chicken and waffles while waking up after a night in Vegas, I started searching for nearby eateries that served chicken and waffles and also had pretty good ratings (which is always my determining factor) and came across Rise & Shine.  After looking at the photos on yelp and reading the reviews I had already made up in my mind that I wanted their chicken and waffles, but once I was seated and saw how small the waffles were, I asked if I could have pancakes and waffles instead; and indeed did I make a good choice.  Those where the most fluffy, soft, and flavorful pancakes I've ever tasted.  The chicken on the other hand, could've used a bit more seasoning but overall, I enjoyed the food and the service."}
{"text":"Again this will be short and sweet. I love coming here because my monkeys and I feel like family. I brought a fellow yelper (YAY Mackalicious!) to see what I was bragging about and he felt the exact same way. We love you Steve and crew. Will be back soon for more breakfast goodness."}
{"text":"The cinnamon french toast is great. The red velvet chocolate chip pancakes are excellent! Best red velvet pancakes I've had. The 3 little pigs breakfast sandwich is also excellent. And of course, there's the pot-o-bread which is very good. Always good service. Do not waste your time with places like Denny's and IHop. This is a real breakfast place."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers!  All of your mouthwatering pics drove me into this place!  I felt like I needed a breakfast \"do over\" after eating at Republic Kitchen and Bar for Sunday brunch.  On Monday before taking my mother-in-law to the airport, we stopped in at Rise & Shine and I couldn't resist the baked blueberry French toast casserole.   The hubs and his mom had what appeared to be the regular eggs and bacon breakfast with hash browns but the taters were so tasty and seasoned and the bacon so crisp and smoky!   I stole a piece to go with my blueberry yumminess!  I loved that the blueberry compote wasn't super sweet.  Our server was though and  we can't wait to go back and try some of the other menu offerings."}
{"text":"I love me some rise n shine! This is a quality breakfast joint and a southern highlands staple restaurant! They are always on point with their fresh pressed juices and fried breakfast meats. I usually get the chicken a top a waffle or biscuits and gravy. Today I came a little closer to lunch time so decided to try the friend chicken and avocado sandwich! And let me tell you it did not disappoint. Juicy chicken fresh avocado and perfectly cooked bacon made this sandwich almost to die for! Thank you for being the quality we need in the southern highland neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.  Good food and good friendly service!  Had the bacon & eggs.  Husband had chicken fried steak & eggs.   Mine was good ( bacon could have been thicker) husbands chicken fried steak was huge and very good.  Will be back."}
{"text":"The only reason why I gave this place a 3 star was because the customer service was really bad! The waitresses and hosts were like all in a bad mood  with each other!! On the other hand the food was delicious I had the chicken and waffle it was great! However will not go back to this place customer service is a big thing in places specially restaurants!!"}
{"text":"Great food, coffee and service. It's mom and pop places like this that should be supported."}
{"text":"I always ate here. Every time! We found a plastic piece from a bread bag in our butter and no one came over and apologized or offered anything. It was very matter of fact and no importance to customer service or value at all. It's sad because we will now need to find a new breakfast place to eat. Wish their customer service was a bit better. When we left the server didn't even look us in the face when she nonchalantly said \"thank you have a nice day\" like it was pulling teeth. We are going back to the Griddle or New Day."}
{"text":"I have visited Rise and Shine on many occasions, I live clear in the North East Las Vegas and I am willing to make the long drive to this location in Henderson for a great breakfast. Their menu selection has something for everyone in your party (assuming you don't have strict limitations like kosher, vegan, paleo and all that stuff that I fortunately don't care about. although I did see some stuff that may fit some of the healthy needs) they have sweet dishes, savory dishes. My personal choice for this trip was the corned beef hash with a pot of bread...if you haven't had their pot of bread I highly recommend it! The rest of my party all had something a bit different, Chilaquiles, some amazing looking steak bagel benedict and a dish that I can't recall because I was too busy stuffing my face and enjoying a nice morning cup of coffee. I will say that on this visit it seemed like my coffee was a bit cooler than I would like, but the service from Maria made it ok, she topped our drinks off frequently and made sure we had everything we needed on this visit. The prices are a bit above average for a sit down breakfast and lunch place, expect to pay around 14 to 18 per person, but the quality and portion of food makes it a way better choice than just swinging by McDonald's or I-Hop. Price is fair for the food period. If you are looking to have a great breakfast with your significant other or a group of friends, check this place out. The servers are all wearing pajamas, so if you roll in wearing yours, you might get asked for a refill or something :-) 

Dishes that I enjoy
cinnamon crunch french toast thing
Corned beef and hash
Steak bagel benedict thing
two fisted bagel sandwich 
Pot of bread"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in the world. Their French toast with cinnamon toast crunch cereal on it is my favorite, along with the fried chicken and waffles. Good coffee."}
{"text":"Only have had breakfast here. Food is very good with good choices. Service is pajama service and good. Cute umbrella decorated ceiling. Usually order ham steak and eggs with hash browns. The steak is huge, eggs always done to my order, hash browns could be crispier, but that takes longer. Not cheap, but good value for your buck."}
{"text":"I live in Southern Highlands and I've heard of this place and driven by it many times. A friend finally recommended it so we thought we would  try it out. It was everything I thought it would be;  overpriced the food was great and not good at the same time with the drink delicious but small and the service was fantastic.

The waitress was friendly, helpful, and had recommendations as we had never been there.  She was very nice throughout.  I had a GoGo drink that was fresh juice and id say about 8 oz for $5.  Way to small but delicious.   Then i ordered the corned beef hash with bacon.  It was nothing short of fantastic!  3 poached eggs that were cooked to perfection with this dish.  This came with 1 small biscuit.  It needed 2 at that size.  My friend ordered a steak breakfast burrito with the steak done medium.  The sauce (like an adobo) was aweful.   The meat was super well done.  And as a hole it was terrible.  (Hate to say that about any dish) but she had about 1/2 and was done.   1 coffee as well.  Couldn't tell you about that as i don't drink much coffee.  

Bill was $35 and i feel it just wasn't worth that price.  
I would order the corned beef hash again as it was just amazing.  But that's it!  Hope this was helpful for anyone wanting to come here."}
{"text":"My mother and I came visiting from Los Angeles and stayed in a hotel nearby, and found this place on yelp. Everyone else is so right! Their food is amazing! It was so great that we went two days in a row! The first day we got the fruit plate, coffee, 2 cup of breads, and the salmon omelette with egg whites. The food was great and the cup-of-breads are to die for! You have to get one! Our server was so accommodating and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Loved this place, food is delicious and everyone so attentive. Will definitely stop by when I am in Las Vegas again. The steak is a must!!!!"}
{"text":"Fun breakfast place to hit when driving back to LA. Has all the standard breakfast fair, but most with a twist, like their chilleqetas with steak.  It's made with Doritos, wrong but oh so right. The portions are big and prices reflect it.  I like that they have healther options like yougert and fresh fruit and granola parfets and fresh pressed juices.  Theur hot latte and ice latte were not that great but I'm picky.  The service was great, fast and friendly. Probably because all the waitresses are on their pajamas and their comfy.  They also have fun twirling flower umbrellas on the ceiling for lighting."}
{"text":"If your on this side of town. This place has amazing eggs Benedict. The place is clean and the service is amazing! And I hear the waffles are to die for!"}
{"text":"Every time we're in Vegas we eat breakfast here on our way home. The service is heat, the food is amazing. The bread in a cup is unique and so good! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Really long wait this morning. Orders were getting lost, customers were waiting a really long time, and there was lots of complaining from the cook.
This is only my second chance to try this restaurant and will probably be the last. To start off my experience, my wife and I were asked to wait for a seat. Normally, this is no problem but I could see at least 4 tables that were clean and nobody sitting at them. Not a big deal as we were in no hurry. 
We were seated and taken care of right away. We ordered coffee and water and needed a couple of minutes do decide on our food. My wife ordered the French toast and I ordered biscuits and gravy. For the next twenty minutes we listened to the cook argue with the waitresses and watched customers walk out the front door. Almost 30 ,minutes went by and our food finally arrived. I got scrambled eggs instead of over easy and the waitress fixed it right away. My wife's meal was warm but certainly not hot.
As I dug into my biscuits and gravy, I was greeted by crunchy biscuits and a sad excuse for gravy. The biscuits tasted like the kind you would get in a tube of Pillsbury and I needed a knife to cut them. The gravy was clumpy and tasteless. I have been cooking gravy for many years and it looked like the flour, or mix, in this case was thrown in and not blended very well. This was, by far, the worst plate of biscuits and gravy I have every eaten. Biscuits and gravy is a relatively easy dish to do well and it says volumes when a breakfast restaurant cannot do it right.
I did let the girl at the register know how disappointed I was with my breakfast and she took it off my bill. That was very cool.
My first time to Rise and Shine was pretty good and the second was less than impressive. I was told that the reason the prices were a little high is because of the quality ingredients that were used. I would disagree. It seems like either corners are being cut or the cooks are not happy with their jobs. Either way, this will probably be my last adventure out of the way to come to Rise and Shine.."}
{"text":"Wow... What a menu! They've got something for everyone! I might be one of the pickiest eaters out there! We ordered a bunch of items and everyone one in our party was beyond satisfied! I will definitely be a returning customer."}
{"text":"First choice was closed, so came here instead and I am glad I did. Although it is far, but it is worth it. The cinnamon pot bread was moist, warm and just delicious. Wish it could be bigger!! Tried chicken and waffles for the first time definitely not disappointed. The fancy steak omelette was a winner as well with the sauce. Yum yum!!! Totally satisfied and will be making the drive again."}
{"text":"Very poor service, this place used to be good.  I'm not impressed with the service or food.  I walked out this weekend after waiting over 25 min for table."}
{"text":"Everything was cold , we won't be back. The service was just as bad. This was very disappointing because there were some good reviews."}
{"text":"Have become a regular here. Small wait times and big delicious plates. I have tried almost everything on the breakfast menu, can never go wrong."}
{"text":"Came in here do to the great reviews.  Service was great and the food was delicious.  The steak had lots of flavor the eggs are perfect.  The hash brown was good but a little oily but overall I was very satisfied.  I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Rise & Shine - A Steak & Egg Place fills the breakfast/brunch void in the Southern Highlands area. It is in the same shopping center as Off the Strip Just Real Food, which offers brunch but only on Sundays. It just opened yesterday and appears to already be a hit with the locals.

There is a wide selection of breakfast and lunch options but, as their name suggests, it is all about their steak and eggs. My husband ordered the Southern Style Chicken Fried Steak ($10.95), his usual order that is usually the determining factor in whether a breakfast joint is worth it. I ordered the Crispy Fried Chicken Breast and Waffles ($11.25).  Both dishes were huge and very filling. The chicken fried steak was good but, according to the husband, doesn't live up to his standards because the batter wasn't flavorful enough. I really enjoyed my chicken and waffles. The breast was moist and the batter was light and airy. The Belgian waffle was delicious as was the maple syrup.

The décor is nice with mosaic walls and flower umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. The service was prompt and decent considering they just opened the day before. I give this place a 3  1/2 stars because it is definitely worth trying but I still prefer other breakfast/brunch places such as The Original Pancake House and The Egg & I. I do see this restaurant thriving in this area because I predict there will be regulars that will patronize this place."}
{"text":"Well executed food for adults in the vein of \"MTO\" downtown.  Not the MTO/Hashhouse experience, but somewhat that style. Rather underwhelming for children though! A five and two year old and we had to share the adults' food to satisfy them?  And they normally leave food on the plate. The five dollar half waffle (not Belgian/huge/pick your adjective) was the biggest head scratcher. So much so that we asked the server if it came with anything else to which the answer was an apologetic \"no\". So either keep the kids at home (if able) or have them split an adult entree (which is well executed). Will we come back now that we know this?  That is a head scratcher too."}
{"text":"What a concept! Steak and Eggs used to be a once in awhile treat because of the price (usually) and the calories (who cares now...!)! But, at Rise and Shine, it is BEYOND delicious, portions are just right, and the price is right! The servers are dressed in Jammies, they have Illy coffee (French Press too if you like and I highly recommend it!) fun cinnamon bread in flower pots as a choice of bread (NOT to be confused with a cinnamon roll - it is not sticky sweet like that. More like Cinnamon toast - you can put butter and jam on it). They have Chilaquilles, which my hubby who loves SW cuisine/flare, was just in love with . The perfect hint of heat, great flavor on his steak - \"Baby, most places just don't season their steaks anymore... this is perfect!\" was the comment that I got, and let me tell you, my hubby is Picky with a capital \"P\"! 
definitely recommend going early. We went at 8am after dropping a friend off at the airport and by 845am there was a wait already (on Father's Day). Love it Love it Love it and will definately be back!"}
{"text":"I see why this place comes up as one of the best BREAKFAST in Las Vegas.
I will definitely return here next time in Vegas!!
 On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it an 11!!!"}
{"text":"Completely off the beaten Vegas path, but well worth the visit!!! Loved it!!!! Do try the pot bread;)!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my toddler after my eyebrows threading appointment and we had a 10 min wait before we were sat down.

We shared the green juice and the corned beef hash plate.  Too bad there wasn't rice for me to order with the food.  They do however offer the cup o bread.  I was so full after the food, that could not eat the cup o bread.  The decor was nice, my toddler was naming all the colors of what she thought were butterflies attached to the ceiling.

It's also very cool to see all the staff in the pjs.  Different than majority of other b-fast spots."}
{"text":"Pro's
Wait for a group of 20: only 15-20 mins!
Service: far superior than some fine dining places! Staff actually looked like they enjoyed working there.
Food: Cinnamon french toast was perfectly crisped, sweet, & fresh. Steak Chilaquiles got high marks from our group as well.

Meh:
Toast in a cup: though you'd think otherwise."}
{"text":"First impressions are important to me. I really want to give these guys more stars, but it didn't meet the hype that everyone have it. We were told 30 minute wait, we waited 45 then left. Might I add, I noticed 2 four tops 3 two tops open but not cleaned. The efficiency of the place can get better, I hope it does. I started my experience like most and washed my hands, the bathrooms were disgusting. Clean it up."}
{"text":"Found this place close to home --- thanks to YELP. ::claps hands::

The flowers from the ceiling is really quaint and cute. Open lay out to where you can see into the kitchen. The servers are in jammies - which just makes you feel a tad comfortable. 

The potted cinnamon bread was a little cold - if it was warm, I would think they would be amazing. 

Cup of Illy coffee was ok. 

I had the steak and eggs while my partner in crime had the chicken fried steak (she fancies Crack'n Barrell - but it is 2 hours away!)

The steak was ok - it was moist not dry. It was good with its side kick A1.

The chicken fried steak had a piece of hair or nylon in the breading which we made sure the waitress know, but we said its ok we just wanted to bring it to your attention. Five minutes later, the server brought her a new freshly cooked chicken fried steak as a courtesy @ no charge. Well... since she was halfway through her meal we decided to take it with us. 

Overall good experience. There was a tad wait for the food, but kind of expected it in a full FOH, but we didn't mind as we were catching up on our current events. And no... that doesn't mean facebook. News!

Til next time."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but there wasn't much corned beef in the corned beef hash. The staff is very good. The pancakes were delicious"}
{"text":"Your first thought when walking in? \"Look how neat this place is!\" Servers in pajamas, upside down flower-print umbrellas hanging from the ceiling (some even spin!), and overall relaxed vibe. The wait for me is usually about 10-20 minutes depending on what time I get there. 

Like Marie T., this place USED to be my favorite breakfast place. It was also icing on the cake that it is walking distance from my abode. I keep giving them chances to change my mind, but I get disappointed every time.

My favorite thing to order is the Fancy Steakhouse Omelet. Thankfully, its taste consistency has remained the same and is always \"good.\" My second favorite would be the Crispy Fried Chicken Breast and Waffle. I was never a fan of Chicken & Waffles until I ate it at this place. The New York Steak, Spinach, & Benedict-Bagel was the worst thing that I have ever ordered. The presentation was extremely lacking.. The words Hot Mess came to mind; which made my food unappetizing. 

The Pot of Bread for a side is one of the reasons why I keep wanting to come back, but for the last THREE times they have been unable to keep up with the demand and simply say \"they're out.\" Instead, customers have to choose between getting toast or a biscuit. Ugh. If you're a server and you see that my hash browns are either burnt or undercooked then do not bring it out to me. I will say something. Also, we keep getting handed other people's tabs.. get it together guys."}
{"text":"I decided to try the chicken & waffles.   Jennifer was our waitress again.  This was only our 2nd visit.  She remembered what we ordered last time.  She's funny and professional.  When we we're getting our check, my husband asked her, so since your so good.....then she butted in and said, military discount.   (ohhhh snap)  she's good, and my chic and waffles were delicious.  I think that's my favorite there now."}
{"text":"Went here this morning $60 For crap! 
4.50 for a cup of KIDS orange juice RIDICULOUS. 
I got the avo steak egg whites omelet it was bland and the avocado was three slices the steak was cheap steak. The hash browns were bland as well. 
For the price I will not be returning I rather eat at Denny's."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just really want a huge breakfast after a weekend in Vegas served on a plate bigger than your face. Hubby had the chicken and waffles it was some of the best chic and waffs I've ever tasted with warm homemade syrup. I had country fried steak and eggs. Usually it's like a pounded out piece of mystery meat but here it was literally a steak. Maybe we just fill up fast but neither of came close to finishing our food. Waitress was nice. It's cute having everyone in pajamas. And someone tell me, do all the flowers on the ceiling spin or just some? I couldn't tell and I forgot to ask haha. Driving me crazy."}
{"text":"Today was a disappointment. I come to this from time to time that I almost know what's on the menu without looking at it. As today is the their time in a year that I've ordered corned beef, I've noticed how very different it is now. There is hardly any corned beef I see in my plate . It's probably just this meal that they have changed but breakfast being the first meal of the day, this really made me lose my appetite. I didn't even touch the meal anymore . They showed me a side order of it and it's the same. I guess they don't understand, people expect breakfast from restaurants to be better than what we could make at home. This one is worst corned beef hash meal served to me in all the restaurants I've ever been to here and abroad."}
{"text":"Place has been open for 7 weeks already. Came here with my buddy. The loco Moco and signature ribeye chilaquiles were off the hook. Our server Maria was great! She explained the menu very well and her service was on point. Hope to come back after our gym workouts again! Thanks Rose and Shine!"}
{"text":"i just wanted to say thanks to jessica the hostess. i couldnt decide what to order so she suggested the pot o bread. very tasty. i then chose egg whites only omelet with cheese, bacon. my waitress carrie made me feel at home she has a lot of energy which made us all smile and made it a fun visit. jessica and carrie your the best !!!!"}
{"text":"Didn't know about this place and happened to come across it on Yelp...so glad we did! We usually frequent Cracked Egg, Egg Works, etc and we were looking for a new place to add to our rotation. Servers wear pajamas which is really fun. I ordered an omelet and it was delish; came with the pot of bread which was very tasty and such a cute idea! My husband ordered the cinnamon crunch French toast platter....I kept stealing bites it was so good! We will definitely be coming back, there were a lot of things on the menu we would like to try!"}
{"text":"I love their creations! The food is great! Pancakes are heavenly, I love the eggs  Benedict! I love the popovers. I've seen the chicken and waffles they look amazingly! Try this place!"}
{"text":"This place is busy, busy! Choose your timing well; regardless, it's worth the wait! 

I had the steak and spinach Benedict. Huge serving (for 2 hungry people) but the meat was tender, cooked perfectly and I love their hollandaise sauce with the balsamic extract. YUM! 

The spot is clean, well decorated, and I can't speak highly enough about the service. 5 stars for the service without a doubt.

I feel their menu is slightly limited and given their huge portions (a lot of meals are pretty heavy, too) I won't make this my \"go-to\" place, but I'll get a craving for it (and their cup o' bread). We'll be back! 

Worth checking out (for you meat lovers only)."}
{"text":"We haven't been in this area since my disaster of an experience a few doors down(Refer to my Xtreme Sushi review) but with all the high ratings, I knew we'd make it here one day.

Yes, it is clear across town, yes, we're up by Mt. Charleston, Yes, I am that person who'll drive AAAAAAALL the way to Hendertucky for the best Snow Ice in town, and Yes, there are too many whiner vaginers who make a big deal because of the distance travelling farther than outside of their hood....two answers for you-1) Stay home, or
2) Make like Rhianna and SHUT UP AND DRIVE!!!!

Breakfast/Brunch is my absolute favorite meal of the day, and we're always looking for another spot to add into our breakfast/brunch rotation. I like the quirky atmosphere here. Everyone is so welcoming as you walk in, spinning umbrellas up on the ceiling, waitresses in pajamas like they just rolled out of bed ready to serve you. Puts a smile on your face..:) One weird thing was the \"Help us...Yelp us\" on the back of the busboys' shirts. Don't know if that's against Yelp policy, but its not like they need to do that....They have a great fan base, and great food!

Menu selections here are plentiful, and our waitress Riley was AWESOME SAUCE! She was very informative, personable, and offered up suggestions, popular items, and even her personal favorites. when we narrowed it down, we split the Fried Chicken Breast and Waffles and The Ultimate Steak and Eggs Plate, with the potted bread(Took a page from Jamms?) as our bread choice, with some fresh squeezed OJ(they use Navel, not Valencia) Two HUGE chicken breasteses were fried to perfection-crisp, well seasoned exterior, and the inside stayed nice and juicy and went perfectly with the crisp, light waffle drizzled with the cinnamon infused syrup, which was unfortunately Log Cabin. The ribeye was a perfect medium rare as requested, and the hash browns were not your typical out of the box type and you can tell it was made in house. Nice and crisp on the outside, soft and creamy on the inside. As popular as they are, the potted bread didn't arrive until after we were done with breakfast. No one's fault though, as Riley even offered another bread choice, we chose to wait. Its kinda like a little Cinnabon in a flower pot that comes with a cream cheese glaze on the side and was a great ending to our meal.

Definitely can't wait to come back to attack their Sweet Cream Pancakes, Chilaquiles, and other popular items.   ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. The service is excellent and so is the food. The portions are pretty filling. The staff is dressed in PJs which I think is too cute!! I have tried a few different things and there is nothing that I did not like."}
{"text":"We eat here every  Sunday after church. The food is  consistently good and the wait staff is  great! Thank you Ashley, Cary and Vanessa. You're  all amazing  & thanks  for buttering my toast!"}
{"text":"First time eating here. The line was out the door but it was well worth the wait. The staff were all very friendly, our food came out quickly and everything was amazing. The kids loved the fresh juice as well. My eggs were not cooked correctly and the owner came out herself with a fresh order and said you can't not like your eggs. We were super impressed with the customer service. Best breakfast we've had in a while, we will definitely be back! Well worth the money and the wait."}
{"text":"Ryley girl you are fantastic! She had a great personality and made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. 
The steak and eggs Benedict on an everything bagel was perfection. The BF got the ultimate breakfast and loved it as well. The chilaquiles were delicious. Bread in a pot gets an A+ from me. Oh and how could I forget the hash-browns seriously sooo good. I was sad I couldn't finish my meal. 

The decor and staff adds to the charm of this neighborhood breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Average breakfast place. Had some high expectations due to recommendations from a friend, left kinda diappointed. 

Eggs were not runny in the eggs benedict. Sad."}
{"text":"I loved this place! Food was awesome, decor was gorgeous, atmosphere was pleasant, all the employees were happy & comfy looking in their pajama uniforms, & the variety of food was perfect for breakfast! I was really impressed with the juice bar too, it's been way too long since I've had fresh orange juice & I was so happy to be able to order some! 

Def. a must try place!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place after reading all the good yelp reviews. We went in just before closing on a Monday. Our waitress wasn't the most friendly person but she was reliable and efficient. The menu is huge, however everything was a bit more expensive than I expected. For example, a plain waffle was like $9 but one with fruit was like $11. Considering it wasn't a specialty waffle or novel in any way, that seemed a bit much to me. Overall, everything was good, but not as over-the-top as the yelp reviews made it sound."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat breakfast.  My girlfriend and I just moved near here.  We've stopped by about 3 times since.  Haven't had a bad meal yet.  The service has been good and friendly each time."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Nothing negative to say. Cute idea and execution; especially the uniforms. Food is well prepared and very flavorful. Will def go back next time in town. Wait staff was awesome and aimed to please the customer!"}
{"text":"Meh...I had better, my eggs & cornbeef hash was underwhelming. Also, my girlfriend had the bagel eggs and bacon sandwich not so much flavor. It wasn't terrible, but we expected more."}
{"text":"Fabulous place. Food yummy. Service excellent. We had the county fried steak and eggs, and steak and eggs. Steak was cooked perfectly. I highly recommend if you want a delicious breakfast at a reasonable price point."}
{"text":"I was very impressed at Rise & Shine! A cute place with indoor and outdoor seating. People bring their dogs too and the staff brought them water. The servers wear pajamas! 

I ordered the NY Steak and spinach Benedict bagel. The bagel had everything on it and the steak was cooked to preference! When choosing your bread option, ask for the pot o bread! It's a little cinnamon bread in a flower pot and is yums with butter!  My friend ordered a breakfast sandwich and it looked really good! 

Good sized portions here and good coffee. Friendly service and a perfect meal after a Vegas weekend!  I hope to find a place like this in SoCal!"}
{"text":"Been here twice, my girlfriends been there about 4 or 5 times now.  This place is awesome.  If you haven't eaten here, do yourself a favor and go get some breakfast right now.  Their biscuits and gravy is addicting.  That along with some fresh squeezed orange juice (with lots of pulp) is a winner in my book.  My girlfriend is more adventurous when it comes to food, so she's tried more meals than I have.  She's liked everything she's ordered as well.  She loves the french press coffee.  I'm not a coffee guy so I figured I'd take her word for it.  Also, the staff is very friendly.  It's in a good area, not too far away from where I live, and the prices are great.  The prices for the meals are only slightly higher than what you'd pay at an IHOP or a Denny's, but the food is soooo much better.  You just really can't beat this place.  The only suggestion I have for this place is that they offer Gluten Free bread products.  

A+++ in my book."}
{"text":"Uhm, what? There's, actually, a yummy place near my house?

The waffles are gigatic. Not scary Man vs. Food gigantic but, definately better tasting than Hash House a Go Go, iHop, Denny's, even Egg and I. Their potatoes hash is really good. Not mushy and spiced just right.
The steak was made perfect. Moist but, over done like South Point's steak.

Super excited that they serve my favorite coffee ever-in-life: Illy. Yessss, ILLY IS ILL!

Love that the waitresses are all in pajamas; and the decor is just bright and makes u wanna wake up in the morning! --- I mean, besides the fact that I'm a morning person and all.

I have yet to try their lunch which has rave reviews, too.

All in all thankful to eat something other than McDonald's egg mcmuffins in the morning =)"}
{"text":"great food and service. Get the bread in a cup. Fresh juice A+."}
{"text":"I work in the \"industry\" and I would've gave a higher rating but service is major and thus we lacked. Food and portions are great but service sucked, well OUR server anyway.(For her sake I won't mention her name). She was really nice though, just lacked in customer needs. We were there a little over an hour and WE had to ask to refill our coffee, came to checkup on us once. While she stand at the prep area talking stories and just hanging out. Would eat there again, just hope we have a different sever."}
{"text":"It's a cute brunch place. The portion size is pretty big. The steak is a nice portion, very juicy n tender. I would also recommend the cup o bread."}
{"text":"Just finished eating here and it has never failed to put a smile on my face! Staff are very personable and relatable and continuously makes sure that your dining experience is awesome great start of my Easter morning!"}
{"text":"Maria was terrific! We were in a time crunch and she got our lunch out to us quickly. The food was great. The crunchy French toast is our favorite and their coffee is outstanding!"}
{"text":"This breakfast is like a great home cooked meal. Delicious food, portions are enough to share. Customer service was good .Dain our server was nice and have great suggestions on what to order. The decor was cute and I loved that the servers wore their pajamas to work."}
{"text":"Came here as we were searching for a place to eat in Southern Highlands and did a search on Yelp. Ultimate Steak & Eggs is the best breakfast I have had in Vegas for the price. Corned beef hash is amazing and service was friendly. Breakfast seem like it would just be breakfast and you can't make it any better than what it already is but these guys prove that wrong. I have now been here 3 times and everything I have ordered has been top Notch!! Thanks Rise & Shine!!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast and service! Really liked the country fried steak and eggs, waffle and fried chicken great, steak omelet was great too, along with Pressed Coffee.  Only thing that disappointed me was the common jelly, homemade fruit or better end jam or jelly would have really been the icing on the cake to go with their homemade signature bread in a pot. Get over there now!! They close at 3:00!"}
{"text":"We make a point of coming here whenever we are in Vegas. Love the atmosphere and friendly staff. Food is always great -- their waffles are crispy and delicious and the menu is fun and inventive. Tried the chicken and waffle and banana frosted flake pancakes and we were not disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a pretty good american style breakfast with nice portions and a great price.  I had the Spiced rubbed ribeye and chiliquilles.  It was very good.  My wife ordered the avo-veggie and eggs benedict.  This looked scrumptious.  They have fresh juices you can order that they make on the spot.  We ordered the strawberry watermelon juice.  This place serves alcohol, also.  It is hard to find, but the list is on the top right hand corner of the menu.  We decided to order a carafe of the Tokyo Screwdriver, which is orange juice with sake.  The freshly squeezed OJ put this over the top.  This place doesn't take itself too seriously.  All the servers wear pajamas.  It almost makes you feel like you are having breakfast in bed.  Now rise and shine, it is time to eat some breakfast."}
{"text":"I've given this place multiple chances and each have come up short. The service is always slow, even when the place isn't busy. The servers are friendly and their pajama uniforms are fun, but it doesn't make up for lack of service and sub par food. The food is overpriced in my opinion, and either too seasoned or totally bland. After many attempts to get a timely, good meal here, I have given up."}
{"text":"OMGosh- This place is heavenly! The best omelette and hash browns that I have ever had. My omelette was cooked perfectly ( not too firm and over cooked like their Flamingo location). And the Pot of Bread was a fun way to serve a cinnamon roll. Service was attentive with a smile! If you have a hankering for some good grub then this is the place to be."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what the rave is about with this place! 
Average seat time was 20 minutes, we we're sat in 30. The set up is totally disorganized, tables sitting dirty, 1 bus boy carrying dirty dishes from one table to the other to consolidate the dirty tables . 
The pajama appearance accompanied by a dirty floor, booths, table almost give the place an unhygienic feel. 
The food was ok, nothing to rave about. We have had better coffee and breakfast at sunrise cafe, brio, I hop! The oj was fantastic. We would not return. It's actually a shame considering how convenient the location is to our home."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. The food, staff and coffee are all wonderful. On a weekend morning/afternoon be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes so don't go hungry. (I made that mistake a first and last time-lol). They fall in line with the other like breakfast restaurants in town. I go here most because it's the closest to my home."}
{"text":"I came here about a year ago and the food and service were great. Stopped by for breakfast today and was instantly brought to a table. Sat there for over 15 minutes without anyone coming over, even to get a drink order. The two tables next to us had waitresses constantly checking on them. We got up and left, won't be coming back here. Customer service goes a long way."}
{"text":"This place is good if you're not on a diet. Otherwise, trying to order a custom omelette or breakfast gets VERY expensive."}
{"text":"Not great, but not horrible. It's a small restaurant with only a few staff at a time. The wait staff is awesome. Quick with refills and to clean off tables. They make them wear pajamas which I thought was a little weird... I ordered a country fried steak and egg breakfast. This thing was enormous and I was excited, but when I cut into it I realized that it was WAY over breaded and didn't really taste like much. It didn't come with gravy which is my fault for not asking but that would have helped. The hash browns were pretty good and the egg was fine. They brought me this thing called a \"pot of bread\" it was just a roll in a coffee mug. I would have rather had some toast or a pancake or something besides a plain roll. I give it a 3 because of how hard I see the wait staff working but the kids working in the back may need some more experience on preparing the food. I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Went here for a nice breakfast on our way out of Vegas. The ambiance is nice and relaxing.  Servers wear pajamas and invite the guests to do the same. The pot of bread was great as others have commented, but, the best offering, WARMED SYRUP. Such a sumple concept that so many get wrong. 

Daughter had chcken and waffles, yum, tasted kinda like pancake batter on the chicken. Baby girl ordered chicken fried steak which did not disappoint.  The gravy is served in ramekins on the side. Hb had corn beef hash which was disappointing. Had a lemony taste to it. Unpleasant.  I had the crunchy french toast, wow! Never thought I'd enjoy it, but, it was great as well. 

Overall, can only go four stars due to the lemony corn beef. Riley was a great server, best service we've had sine we've been in Vegas."}
{"text":"This was the best breakfast I've had in quite awhile! I got the rib-eye with the chilaquiles and it was OUTSTANDING! The steak was cooked perfectly, the chilaquiles were cheesy, crunchy, ooey goodness! My mom had the NY strip benedict which was delicious and my grandma got the biscuits with gravy which she is extremely stingy about her biscuits and gravy and she loved it! The hash browns are soooo good to; super crisp and golden. We also got the french press, which was pricey but very good. The service was nice too, not anything outstanding, but a definite 8/10. Overall I loved it and will be returning to try the chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"We found a new breakfast spot!!!
Amazing food but there very busy ( I guess that's a good a thing) so be ready to wait!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! I recommend the buffalo chicken & eggs or chicken & waffle. The chicken is so light and crispy.. it's like nothing I've ever eaten..so yummy..and a lot of food!!"}
{"text":"I'm usually hesitant about restaurants with a gimmick, as well as those that I've never been to. Finally decided to go there for breakfast with the family and glad I did. 
Portions are HUGE!!  Service is a bit understaffed it looked like but they made up for it in attentiveness. 
The food tastes absolutely delicious and as if it was homemade. 
The aroma of the place was very pleasing and welcoming. It's very spacious clean. Every staff member was always moving about to take care of something or someone. 
I recommend this place for anyone who loves big breakfast/brunch and flavorful food. 
5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places when we visit Las Vegas.  The ambiance is cute, colorful and quirky. Servers in PJ's give the atmosphere a very homey quality.  Food has been delicious and consistent on each visit.  Service has always been good as well.  Order the pot of bread...it's delicious and unique!"}
{"text":"I can't get a bad meal here .. True true stuff .. Our waitress was named Cary and she was wonderfully excited and attentive and funny.. I had the ny steak and eggs Benedict which was cooked to a perfect medium rare on the steak as was my preference .. The eggs were a soft medium poach and they were delicious !! Gotta say, whether you're visiting or a local like myself , rise and shine is a must for breakfast !!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint that doesn't just do a solid steak and egg plate, they also approach common breakfast items with a different style meaning you are just eating the same hash browns you could get at a million breakfast joints."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good breakfast/brunch place in the southern highlands area. I had the chicken and waffles, I'm not a chicken and waffles expert but it was pretty darn good. I liked how it their chicken was boneless which made eating it clean and easy."}
{"text":"If you're into the iHop/Denny's style breakfast you will love this place. Imagine a full breakfast at one of cheap diners and the turn up the quality a few notches and you have Rise and Shine. 

I'm not much a steak person for breakfast so I can't comment there, but I did have the biscuits and gravy, bacon, eggs over easy and scrambled, and crunchy French toast. I regret not snapping a photo of the spread. Everything came out hot and fresh at the same time. Oh, also make sure to get the fresh squeezed orange juice, you won't regret it. 

Rise and Shine doesn't have the flashy-ness of anything on the strip but the quality is 100% there. I will definitely be coming here again on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"We really enjoy going to the pajama breakfast place as my husband calls it. The waitresses wear flannel jammie's  and the service is friendly. So far We have liked everything we have tried from both the breakfast and lunch menu. Only downside is the pricing. If there were a few more lower cost options we would go more often."}
{"text":"Yelp- you once again helped me find my new favorite breakfast place (in Las Vegas anyway)!  I found this place using my mobile search app, and I must say I am damn glad I did.  First of all, the atmosphere is darling- bright sunny yellow walls, cute parasol light fixtures hanging from the ceiling, it just made you feel more cheerful walking through the door.   The servers were all on point, and maybe that is because they are extra comfy- all of the servers are working in their PJ's.  

Now for the important part- the food.    I ordered the chilaquiles and eggs. They didn't dissapoint.  Eggs cooked perfectly atop perfectly cooked tortilla chips softened in a tangy but not too spicy tomato sauce.   My Son put the hurt on a huge portion of chicken and waffles.  He was also impressed that they did little things like warming the syrup.   My daughter ordered a spinach/mushroom/swiss omelette.  She said it was delicious and not \"too\" cheesy.  My husband ordered the english banger sausage and eggs.  He said that the sausage was a bit too mild, and could have been a little more savory. 

If there was anything that I could say could improve is explaining to the customers the unique things that the restaurant offers-  The server asked us if we wanted toast, muffin or what sounded like \"powder bread\" .  None of us knew what the hell that was, so nobody ordered it.   It was only later that I noticed these cute little individual breads baked in tiny little terra cotta pots sitting in the pass.   I would have definitely ordered this just to give something new a try.  Something that could have been avoided with a little enunciation."}
{"text":"These guys are truly deserving of 5 stars. I order from Postmates from them. When I do, I order a ton of food. They have never messed up on anything or forgotten anything. The food is cooked to perfection and tasty."}
{"text":"A cute place to grab breakfast. Service was quick & everyone was very nice. I had the red velvet pancakes & boy that could've easily fed 2-3 people. Pancakes were very delicious & moist.  I didn't even need the cream cheese frosting that was served on the side. Also got the cup o bread which was recommended by many yelpers, another yummy choice if you are a fan of cinnamon rolls. The orange juice is freshly squeezed which they mention you can tell by tasting it."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!  This place is off the beaten path...  no where near the strip and thats a good thing.  The food is very very good, we ordered the chilaquiles, eggs benedict and a waffle.  The minus half star is for the waffle, too doughy and the temperature in the restaurant (on the warm side).  Aside of those minor glitches everything was great, the chilaquiles were perfection from the beans, cheese, homemade tortilla chips and salsa.  My husband raved about the eggs benedict too.  Definitely try the french press coffee, so good.  We will be back next time we visit LV because this place is legit."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here this morning and our experience here was not that great. We were a party of five and when we sat down, we asked for water and coffee. We waited for our beverages for more than fifteen minutes. While waiting, we start seeing other parties being seated. They were getting drinks... Where the hell was ours? We couldn't even find our server and we were getting agitated and hungry. 

Finally, our server comes out of the woodwork and gives us our beverages. We gave our order and that too, took forever and a day! They were out of peanut butter and blueberry French toast that we ordered, but didn't tell us until ten minutes later. While waiting, we watch getting more and more pissed with every person on the same row as us get their food while we did not - and we arrived before ALL of them! 

Our server was not attentive, never apologized, and we just felt like they could of cared less if we got up and left. After feeling like we've been there for thirty minutes, we finally get our food. I shared the corn beef hash with my sister. It was ok - I've had better corn beef hash elsewhere. The only reason I give this place two stars instead of one was their Belgian waffle. It was pretty yummy."}
{"text":"Come for the steak and eggs which are a glorious start to the morning. The french press coffee is a must. Amazing! The chilaquiles were pretty good too, but the eggs were pretty runny and Cristina ordered them over medium =(

I wanted to give this place 5 stars based on my meal, but I gotta say when you're waiting to be seated. It's kind of awkward. I mean usually someone will come up and be like \"I'll be right with you, Sir.\" Here, you kind of just wait lol. When they get your name, there's usually tons of empty booths, but it takes a few minutes for them to get set up. I'm looking for things to complain about now, but it's really a non-issue!

Definitely a great place for some steak and eggs."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh juices ! The French toast is amazing . Even just the half order is a lot for a great price. The staff is always nice and accommodating. My favorite new server is Ivan he gives great customer service . We will be back . Thanks Ivan"}
{"text":"Our server, Krystie, was super awesome and knowledgeable.  Great food, terrific service and attention to detail.  Definitely a top notch breakfast place. Exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"This is a great way to end a crazy weekend in Vegas. Best hangover-prepare for normalacy food. 

The food is great for the price too!

FOOD:
Standard breakfast foods. It's better than Denny's/IHOP and such. I try to come here to have their breakfast meals. SO GOOD. 

SERVICE:
Great. The people are in jammies and are attentive! 

DECOR: 
Very cute! Umbrellas and pajamas. 

WAIT:
You will wait on Sunday mornings.

PARKING:
Tons, free, lot

PRICE: 
Like Denny's... you get your bang for your buck."}
{"text":"What a great spot! I had the three little pigs on an everything bagel. It was huge! Ha browns were crispy.
Vannesa our waitress was so friendly and extra sweet! My wife ordered french toast (crispy cinnamon) yummy :p
All the food on everyone else's table looked great too. If I lived in Vegas we would come back here more!!! Until next time ;)"}
{"text":"I was on the border of 2 or 3 stars for this place. Reading the menu online I was looking forward to coming in. 

To preface this review, the food was good. And you get a lot of it. Customer service was...meehhhhh.

THE REVIEW: I ordered the steak and eggs bagel. The steak was cooked great, the bacon was good, and the amount of food was insane. I ordered it with a side of fries. I was munching away, actually rather enjoying my bagel sandwich, when I was unpleasantly surprised by a sharp poke in my mouth. I had bitten into a toothpick that had been left in the steak. The toothpick had been used to hold the filet medallion inside the wrapped bacon. Now, I wasn't seriously injured, but it was an unpleasant sensation at the very least. I informed the waitress who apologized, and about 5 minutes later a man (whom I take it was a chef) came out and apologized. We get the bill of $34 for our breakfast, which surprised me. I have always been under the impression that when your food isn't cooked/presented appropriately (which I would consider foreign objects left in my food \"not cooked/presented appropriately\"), that you never charge the customer for that item. I was definitely disappointed with this, but neglected to argue or contest this. To me it should have been up to the management to make that decision on their own, and it will most definitely influence my decision in the future as to whether or not to patronize this establishment again.

Would I come here again? Probably not.
Would I recommend this place to others? Possibly. Have not decided yet."}
{"text":"If a breakfast spot calls themselves \"A steak and eggs place,\" they'd better have some bomb ass steak and eggs. These guys do.

Cool, colorful atmosphere with employee's in their cute pajamas. I probably wouldn't mind working here just because of that.

I always get the ultimate ribeye plate with a pot of bread. Can't go wrong there at all. Their caramel iced coffee is good too.

Service is always good, but you'll definitely have a wait on weekends. I like to do Monday meetings here to avoid the big crowds."}
{"text":"Came from San Diego and didn't want to eat in a hotel. By chance we came across Rise and Shine and it was was FANTASTIC! Great simple breakfast served beautifully, and hot. The waiteress are all very helpfull, friendly, and very cute in there \"jammies\" (bunny slippers would also be great). Service, food, atmosphere all A++. I will refuse to settle for runny eggs and swill from the hotels and will come to Rise and Shine every time we go to Vegas."}
{"text":"Great service good food would I go again YES.! Do I recommend this for others yes It's prices are inline with others"}
{"text":"A solid 5 stars! 

How can people be so cheerful in the morning?

Amber was our stellar server!  She and the other staff wore cute pajamas and t-shirts with clever sayings!  They all greeted us warmly and checked up on us often!

The decor was so cute and fun! We enjoyed looking up at the floral parasols and tried  to figure out which ones were spinning and if there was some sort 2 pattern...

Food was great!  I cleared my plate of Salmon and Cream Cheese Omelette - so yummy!  And the Bread in the coffee cup was so fun and tasty, too!

We'll probably return if we are in Las Vegas again. It was such a pleasant experience with free parking, convenient location, and awesome food and service!"}
{"text":"Had the \"ultimate\" steak n eggs as they call it... 
It wasn't the BEST I've had but good, it may need more flavor, it kinda had a burnt coal taste? Eggs n hash browns up to par, I ordered side of country gravy for my biscuit and it was a bit bland, needs more sausage grizzle in there or salt... Either way it should be savorrrrrrrry to the tongue....
Service good as usual... Lisa was very nice.
I will have to stay with the chicken fried steak as the winner here.... Next time it's flapjacks to try!

{"text":"It had been over a year since our last foray to Southern Highlands to dine at Rise & Shine - A Steak & Egg Place.  Unfortunately, we experienced the same issues that had kept us away for so long; the ineptitude of the hostess staff.  We added our name to the list when we arrived and were given a 30 minute wait time.  At the 45 minute mark, I asked about our table and was told that there were still 8 parties ahead of us and that they were seating the larger parties first.  uh, okay...  I asked if we could sit at the counter and was told that the counter was part of the wait list, but it was empty.  At the 1 hour mark, I inquired again and was told that there were 4 parties ahead of us.  I asked again about the counter (now with one patron sitting there) and was told that it was closed today.  Weird  

Even though I was annoyed, I felt committed to stick it out after waiting so long.  We were finally seated after waiting an hour and 20 minutes, but only because two parties of 2 in front of us gave up and left.  Maybe they did not appreciate being told that larger parties were more important than they were. 

On to happier subjects:  The food!  

I ordered the Ultimate steak & egg breakfast: $12.95 for an 8oz Rib Eye, two eggs, and hash browns with the pot of bread.  The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, the eggs and hash browns standard, and the pot of bread (basically a cinnamon roll) was good. solid 4/5  

The BF had the Fried Chicken & Waffle: $11.95 for a boneless chicken breast coated in buttermilk and fried sitting on top of a Belgian waffle.   I didn't try this, but was told that it was just okay. 3/5  

I also used the Chamucos Jalapeno Hot Sauce on my eggs and saw that it was made in Henderson.  The waitress noticed that I was reading the bottle and advised that they had bottles for sale for $6, so I scooped one of those up for home use!

I can't really say for sure if we'll ever go back, but I hope they work out their front of house issues."}
{"text":"Been here on 2 visits. The first one was 3 years ago or so and I recently came here because 2 of my friends raved about how good the chicken and waffles is. The first time I don't remember what I ordered but it was something from the steak and eggs side of the menu, wasn't really that good considering I can't remember what it was and it didn't bring me back. We had the pot of bread on both visits and yes it is good especially if you smother it with butter, but hey adding butter to anything makes it taste good. So the second visit my friend I shared the chicken and waffle. It was a huge piece of chicken breast on top of a waffle. The thing that stuck out to me was that the breading had a slight spice to it, very nice touch I must say.  I also like the fact they use a chicken breast which makes it easier to eat with a waffle and place both waffle and chicken on your fork. The is definitely a sharable portion as my friend and I were full afterwards.  It was pretty good, but nothing to make me drive all the way over here considering the location is all the way in Southern Highlands. One of my friend's who recommended it said it's better than Roscoe's chicken and waffles?! I've never had Roscoe's, but if Rise and Shine is a 3.5 in my book I can only wonder why people rave about Roscoe's?! If I wasn't too weight conscious I probably would of gotten a parfait as well. Our other friend ordered the red velvet pancakes and they said it was okay compared the pancakes at Baby Stacks."}
{"text":"My husband and I were highly recommended to Rise and Shine, and were excited to try it. We went today at 12:30, after a short wait we were seated. Waited 10 minutes or so to be acknowledged by waitress, then ordered....45 minutes later my husband called over the waitress and asked about our food. She keep apologizing but no food. I ordered a smoothie and my husband ordered a wrap. FINALLY, it arrived...wrong side for my husband and a lumpy smoothie. Highly disappointed and can not recommend. Will not be back!"}
{"text":"I got the chilaquiles. It was good. I love the decor and the concept. Will be back again -after playing at south point :)"}
{"text":"The chilaquiles might be the greatest breakfast I've ever had. I can't remember if it was just a special or if it was on the menu, but holy moly. There was a lot of food and I generally don't clear my plate at a breakfast place, but this was amazing. A must try!"}
{"text":"Very cute place. The staff is always very fiendly. The food is delicious and a little different than regular breakfast places. It's always a treat for my spouse and I to go. Always left satisfied."}
{"text":"I like to give some credit where credit is due. But, there's not one thing that impressed me or even remotely satisfied me about this place. 

To say that I'll never come back is an understatement. I want the 2.5 hours of my life back with it. We arrived at 950 and were given a 15 minutes wait time, we were sat at 1041. That's right,  almost 50 minutes later. The only reason we waited was because of the great reviews. I'm willing to give some time for something delicious without a problem. Again, it was a Sunday, so a wait is expected, but I counted 3 groups before us who I overheard complain of the wait. ..one waited close to an hour! If my meal had been mildly satisfying I wouldn't be giving 1 star.

By the time we were sat, we were crazy hungry. So, you would think that because we were starving ANYTHING would taste like heaven!  There were 5 of us, and 2 ordered two meal options to share, so we ordered 7 different things. I don't even remember how long the food took, but it definitely wasn't a reasonable amount. I'll start by saying 2 ordered ribeye option and we left half of it on our plate.  I've never had such disappointing ribeye in my life. And my father who never complains, commented on the quality. I don't remember what came on the side with it because everything on that plate was a total dissapointment. The burrito my boyfriend ordered was pretty to look at, but even with the handful of ingredients was nothing but a bland mess. We get a \"dessert\" pancake that we had one bite of and didn't take home, which we always do because I hate wasting food but there was no saving that thing to eat later. 

Considering you pay about $11-16 per dish, I would think you get something well worth your money. I'm thinking now, their hope is to starve people with the wait in hopes they're so hungry at the end they just inhale everything and say it tasted delicious. 

Either way, don't take my word, eat here then drive down a bit further and try something else. There's a plethora of restaurants within a couple miles, some good, this one terrible. Also, please stop with the pajama uniform. It's not cute. I couldn't tell which waitress was awake and which rolled right out of bed. Some of those pajamas looked pretty gross. The staff looked more disheveled than the customers."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. The crunchy cinnamon french toast with hot, cinnamon maple syrup will change your life! And fresh squeezed OJ! Why have I not been here before?
My husband had steak and eggs and loved it. We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time at Rise and Shine. The whole family LOVED it!  Lorell is a fabulous server. SO nice and efficient. A definite asset to Rise and Shine. Love the Bangers. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"the best breakfast place in southern Highlands. been going here for years and have yet to be disappointed by the food or service.

I'm all about eggs benedict and the ham eggs benny is always on point. the ham is freshly sliced and not that cheap kind of boxed ham. I love the light balsamic drizzle they use on top to give it a kick to the taste. the seasoned home fries are also awesome.

if you like cinnamon rolls, you HAVE to try the pot of bread! it's freshly baked in house and served with sweet cream and butter. getting this is a must!"}
{"text":"The food is good. Variety is sparse. Wish they had cottage cheese or apples or bananas as an alternative to potatoes. Not a lot of booths but so there is often a wait for seating. Tried it for lunch too as it is close to home tomato soup is very acidic and not very good, tastes like tomato paste.  Grilled Cheese was ok."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness...jammie wearing, smiling, friendly servers....a Cup of Bread....java.....delicious and now my new fave place"}
{"text":"5 star for French pressed coffee and peanut butter and blueberry compote French toast.
4 star for service and cute bread in pot (but now that I tried, I won't wait for it next time)
3 star for the steak and egg. Our steak came out over cooked. Their saving grace is our server sent it back and brought out a much improved version
2 star for the over priced juice and milk in small glasses:("}
{"text":"I don't know if the cooks have changed or something but that last few times we've been here, the food quality has been OK at best. My wife and I moved over to mountains edge late last year and we use to eat here every weekend. I always got the chicken and waffles and it used to be great. The past few times the chicken has gotten smaller and oily and the waffle is thin and soggy. We are probably not going to go back for a while which I sad because we loved this place."}
{"text":"In Vegas, visiting family down here and so glad I picked to come here for breakfast. First of all the decor in the restaurant was so cute. We came here around 11am and didn't have to wait too long. The service was so nice. I decided to get the crispy chicken breast and waffle. It was soo delicious. The crispy chicken was just so perfect. With this meal, I had the option to pick toast, biscuit, or the pot of bread. I decided to get the biscuit because my cousin got the pot of bread for her breakfast. I would definitely come here again! Our server was really nice and gave us great service."}
{"text":"Arguably the worst service ive had in a long time. Didnt see our waiter for up to 25 minutes. The girl up front seating people had to step up and ended up doing more than our waiter. On top of that, our food was sitting under the heater for so long that everything dried out and got hard. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Best chicken fried steak we had!  The chicken waffle is also very tender and they serve with warm maple syrup.  
Kids love their kids meal, kids' price but the portion is as huge as regular meals.
It is not too far away from the strip, worth to drive down here for a nice American breakfast."}
{"text":"Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous!!!! The manager, Vanessa Lirette was wonderful, so accommodating and made our visit and trip to Rise and Shine one of the highlights of our vacation. She introduced us to menu items we loved, she spoke affectionately and passionately about her love for her job and her employer and her employees seem to respect, love and value her and the large team of employees were happy and seemed to work in harmony. Not something you often see in restaurant operations. She is a jewel and should be cloned!! and promoted!

The quality of the food is excellent, the presentation is wonderful and the portion is big and the \"bread in a cup\" is DIVINE. My girls wanted to keep ordering the \"bread in a cup\" - a wonderful sweet roll with a decadent cream cheese concoction on the side and I finally had to cut off the number of bread in a cup orders they wanted to eat!

The restaurant is spotless, with colorful and fun decorations and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an excellent meal, impeccable service and happy employees that don't roll their eyes when you receive the fifth cup of coffee so you can wash down too many to talk about bread in a cup orders!"}
{"text":"I told our waitress, Christine, that based on the reviews, we had high expectations, and that they had exceeded them. Chicken fried steak: a New York strip. Unheard of, and I've seen a lot of chicken fried steak. Perfectly done, with just the right spice in the accompanying gravy, which came in two side porcelain cups. I'm happy with my fried steak covered & smothered but it made my wife and son happy as they are not into their food touching, and the serving size definitely is share-worthy. The bacon: perfectly finished, with a unique, slightly smoky flavor, and a side is 4 pieces, not 2 or 3. Cinnamon French toast: one of about 8 carb-centric breakfast options, each of which sounded incredible, but again, better than described or expected. My wife's favorite part was friendly Christine whose bright and positive attitude left us with all feeling happier about the day.  We will make a point to return!"}
{"text":"Tried this place a second time to make sure it just wasn't what I had to eat. Had the chicken fried steak and gravy. Was a bit better, but still lacked greatness. The Chilaquiles and the French press coffee is still my favorite way to go! Great service with a smile."}
{"text":"This place is now my absolute favorite place. I went there this morning with my daughter and my best friend for the first time. We were greeted and sat immediately. We were served by Ashley who was amazing and went over the menu with us and recommended some delicious dishes. We ordered the chiliqulies ,red velvet pancakes, avocado and egg bagel sandwich and a omelette. The food was so delicious and so was the \"go go\" drink. I would definitely recommend this place and will for sure be going back frequently. I give this place and our server Ashley a 5 star review!!!! I also need to add I drove from Aliante to Southern Highlights and it was soooo worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I was tempted to give 5 stars but there must always be room left for improvement.  Great little spot, a hidden gem in Southern Highlands.  I hope not too many people find out about this place as I hate waiting for my Monday morning table.  Keep up the great work!  

First times try either the Steak Benedict or the Chicken and Waffles.

*Quick note-  Avoid Sunday's at all cost, 1hr wait at times, plus folks bring in there screaming kids, that haven't been taught how to behave in public, which ruins the whole experience."}
{"text":"WOW!  What an awesome breakfast/lunch/brunch place!  They're only open for these three meals and close pretty early in the day (I think they close at 3:00pm).

Inside this simple exterior tucked in a strip mall you'll find some excellent food.  The inside is similarly simple but with a warm, comfortable feel.  There is a small outside patio area with tables they will setup for you with an umbrella to shield you from the desert sun.  This is ideal if you want to dine with your four legged friend.

The servers wear pajamas!  It's true!  What a fun little touch.  They seemed very friendly as well, and drinks were kept topped up.

The food was awesome.  I recommend their ultimate steak and eggs featuring two or three eggs, hash browns, steak, and a bread choice.  I went for scrambled eggs.  These were just OK; the consistency was kind of... solid.  Sort of like when you scoop them out of a hot tray at a buffet.  The hash browns were very good.  Crispy, crunchy, and actually seasoned instead of just salty.  The steak... wow!  I did not expect it to be such good quality.  It was marbled but not overly fatty, and it was tender and tasty.  I ate the whole thing, and I'm not even a huge steak fan!  Do yourself a favor and try the pot of bread choice.  Think of a small cinnamon roll served in a teacup and you'll get the idea.  It's just enough for a bit of sweetness without eating a huge cinnamon roll.  Given the quality and quantity of food it's a bargain at $14.95 ($16.95 with three eggs).

Rise and Shine was awesome!  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"The spinach benny was absolutely phenomenal!!! And the hostess was absolutely amazing!  our sever Ashley gelato was so awesome!!"}
{"text":"Super cute and cozy place! The wait staff all wear jammies and the ambiance was fun. The bread in a cup was delicious too!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in all of Las Vegas. Always fast service and a great menu. Never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"If you're like me, breakfast is your favorite meal of the day. After my first visit here, I was hooked. I made it a point to plan the rest of my stay in Vegas around having breakfast at Rise & Shine. My wife and I found each experience to be more enjoyable than the last. 

The atmosphere is pleasant, the staff friendly and professional. You have the option of dining inside or outside. The place is patronized by many people, and you may very well have to wait to be seated, especially on the weekends. We were there when it seemed to be peak hour for business and we never waited more than 15 minutes.

The menu! It screams \"breakfast\", yet with many creative twist to otherwise conventional meals. Overall it's the perfect combination of quality and quantity. I had the Ultimate Steak Breakfast, oh so satisfying. A large ribeye steak, eggs, hash browns and choices of breads. All made to your liking of course. What really blew me away, was the Cinnamon Crunchy French Toast. My taste buds are still having a party (licking my lips).

A must try place in my opinion! It's hard to go wrong with a place that has people lined up to eat there!"}
{"text":"I love this little hidden breakfast treasure. Clean and so tasty. All the food looks so pretty as it comes out and is huge portions while still being flavorful and fresh. They use to give everyone this amazing pot of bread with your meal and now it is extra so that makes me a little sad. The chicken fried steak is to die for, chicken and waffles is amazing too but it's that waffle that blows my tastebuds away. I'm not a waffle fan but this is the only waffle I've ever tasted that is moist, fluffy, and full of flavor. To top it off they make their own syrup with vanilla and cinnamon inside that make u keep it dripping for more. About $15 a person so not a cheap breakfast spot but you will have leftovers."}
{"text":"The ambiance was great and our server awesome.  It's cool to come in and see flowers hanging from the ceiling, you'll know what I mean when you see it.  The servers are dressed in PJ's, just a really cool, quaint place that isn't overly loud or overly quiet.  A great place to catch up with friends.  The servers are pretty awesome too.  Come check it out."}
{"text":"I was in the mood to try a new place for breakfast and I checked Yelp and found this place.  It's a good distance from where I live, but why not drive a little to get a great breakfast, and that's just what happened.

I like it so much when menus are posted online and I had already chosen the breakfast I was going to get.  When it came time to order, I took my server's recommendation and ordered the rib eye steak chilaquiles.  I chose the pot of bread instead of toast or biscuit.  The bread was good, but I wish it had more cinnamon.  That would have made it and outstanding breakfast accompaniment.

The main action was the spice rubbed rib eye steak--there was a small amount of rub flavoring--and it was done rare just the way I ordered it.  For the eggs, I got over easy which was put on top of the refried beans and chips of the chilaquiles.  The cotija cheese added so much flavor!  The eggs were topped with sliced avocado.  Very nice presentation.

My server, sorry I didn't note the name, was quite good.  The restaurant is not large and when I was leaving around 9:30, there was a wait for tables.  I think I'll go back sometime and get my original choice and compare the two!  I am glad I gave Rise & Shine a try!"}
{"text":"Fun place, nice options for breakfast, great Lavazza Coffee (#1 Coffee in Italy), traditional breakfasts and health conscious options available.
Upbeat, cheerful staff offering great service.  Recommended.
No outdoors or pets allowed."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot! My siblings and I use to come here all the time. 

Food is good. It's reasonably priced. The staff are friendly. Cute decor and the workers also wear pajamas lol. This place does get pretty busy tho.. considering they are only open until 3pm."}
{"text":"If you are in the Vegas area this is a must stop! To quote my husband, \"This is the best breakfast I've ever had!\". He had the chicken fried steak. My daughter had the buffalo chicken and she said it was very good. And that is coming from a very picky eater. The atmosphere was great also. Staff wear PJ's like they just got out of bed. I can't remember our servers name but her last name is Gene or Jean. She was great!"}
{"text":"Service was GREAT! Food is delicious! This will be a go to place on our way out of Vegas. I wish this place was in California.  They have fresh squeezed juice(green go-go is delish), smoothies, french pressed coffee.  We had steak and eggs, cooked to perfection. The pot bread(dinner roll and cinnamon roll in a little ceramic cup) is a must.  So glad we tried it."}
{"text":"I am not a breakfast kind of girl and was not happy about going to a breakfast place when my husband told me about Rise and Shine.  So glad I did go tho!

I get the steak breakfast and it's awesome!  My picky kids like their food too!  It's a WIN for us.  We always ask for Colleen because she is totally sweet and takes the best care of us.  Did I mention that we are picky?!?!   LOL!

Can't wait to take my in-laws there when they come into town!"}
{"text":"Wanted to like the place, I really did. Cute idea with the jammies and umbrellas. French Toast was good. But my sister ordered a burrito with NO MEAT and they put chorizo in it. When we asked if there was meat in it she said no, just chorizo. Ok so chorizo is what? And she says sausage.... ummm. So cool, I haven't eaten meat in 7 years until I tried her burrito. Sweet. The server felt kinda bad but maybe she should have an understanding of what is in their menu items. Lame."}
{"text":"Reminds me of the downtown coffee shop. The staff was friendly, the service fast, and the food good.  I'm a waffle person so I don't have anything special to rave about. Next time I may venture out into the menu. There are lots of choices. We'll be back. It's in the corner of the shopping center, surrounded by Yogurt, Italian, and Japanese."}
{"text":"Arrived at 10:45 on Sunday for breakfast with my gal pal.  Surprised by the short wait.  We got a junky table right next to the open door with frigid gusts coming through.  We asked to be moved and were reseated in a nice booth within 5 minutes. Crisis averted.

Good coffee.  We just got the plain ole, plain ole instead of the french press, and it was good.

I decided, since the name says \"a steak and egg place,\" I should probably order steak and eggs.  So, I ordered the \"ultimate,\" a ribeye (my fave cut), 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and sourdough. $12.95.  The steak was cooked perfectly and nicely seasoned.   The hashbrowns were good.  A nice rustic style different from your average frozen shredded hashbrown.  Eggs were cooked perfect as well, just needed salt and pepper.  Easy to add. No complaints.

My gal pal ordered the steak and chilaquiles.  They were very tasty, and quite a portion! I cleverly coerced her into ordering the cinnamon bread so we could share.  It was good.  However; not sweet like I had anticipated.  

The restaurant is super cute.  Decor is charming.  Menu is cluttered and overwhelming.  The service was excellent.  Offered to refill our coffee 3-4 times, allowed us planty of time to chat.  Didn't rush us.

We had a lovely breakfast and I would go back anytime!  I would give it five stars if they had additional offerings such as lattes, cappucinos, bloody mary's and mimosas.  Necessary breakfast beverages in my book.

$33 for two coffees and 2two breakfasts.  $19 each with tip."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Today was my first time and I don't know how I never knew about it! The atmosphere is very welcoming and the waiters/waitresses are extremely nice as well! Must try the chicken and waffles.... Country fries steak... And the pancakes(flakey and fluffy!!!) !  So good!!"}
{"text":"Called for a carry out and waited on hold for over 15 min, hung up, tried to call back and the line was busy for over 30 min. Would love to try the place but as of now can't get through."}
{"text":"I drove over here from the southpoint so i didnt need to eat their nasty buffet, I was happy to see a regular restaurant without smoking or gambling... they also have these amazing cinnamon rolls that come in a cup. what a good idea they are delicious."}
{"text":"Wonderful choice on our way into Vegas for the weekend. Wait was about 20 min, not too bad. We had Crispy Chicken Bagel, Chicken and Waffles, Chiliquiles and Chicken Fried Steak. Everything was great! Wish we had this back in San Diego! Can't wait to go back!  Customer service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Ordered food for pick up and once I got there I had to wait 20 minutes to get my food. The service was slow, the manager was rude. I guess people that eat there are more important. I walk in and there's only 1 person at the cashier. I politely wait but the cashier was trying to save all the papers from flying(the workers would open the side door and the receipts would fly everywhere) then 3 people get in line and the manger tell me to go behind them. But I got there before them?!! That's not fair. I pay and the cashier says have a nice day. I tell him, \"where's my food?\" I loved waiting 20 extra minutes to get my foodlol...just kidding. Oh and you should see the $2.50 I got charged for a side of strawberries. If you don't believe me, look at the picture I posted on yelp. The service gets worse every time I come.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place.... nice decor and Lavazza coffee! The breading on chicken fried steak was perfectly seasoned and it was nice to automatically have gravy on the side to prevent the steak from getting mushy. Salivating just thinking of the food again!"}
{"text":"The BEST chicken and waffles I've ever had. Definitely better than Roscoes. The buffalo chicken and eggs were awesome too. My family and I went to Rise & Shine two consecutive mornings because it was just that good."}
{"text":"The cinnamon crunch French toast was amazing.  My wife had lox and Salmon omelet (keto friendly) was fantastic. If your in the area it's a must try."}
{"text":"Great local place for breakfast. I ordered the Country Fried Steak and Eggs and it was phenomenal. The rest of my family got chicken and waffles and the bananas foster waffles and they enjoyed them just as much as I did. Great service and great coffee as well. Excited to go back again real soon!"}
{"text":"It is awesome to have a Rise and Shine in Henderson, NV, excellent steak and eggs and the pot of bread is delicious. They have fresh squeezed juices and fresh brewed hot coffee."}
{"text":"We have been to rise n shine four times.  At first, we were excited to have a neighborhood place near our house.  Our first experience was good - food was delish and the server was attentive.  

The second time, we waited in line for 20 mins, then waited another 20 mins for someone to help us, then waited another 20 mins for coffee before we walked out.  

Third time, we managed to get sat, again the server was inattentive (waited a long time to get drinks) and got our very slowly made order wrong (my husband always orders eggs over hard, with emphasis and they came back runny).  

Today, we decided to give it another shot, and were seated next to a woman who was talking on her speakerphone.  It made an already loud cafe unbearable.  Management should have asked the woman to step outside for her call.  We walked out and the hostess was unapologetic and a little snippy.

We will not be going back for another try."}
{"text":"Every time we come to Vegas we are always looking for great breakfast spots off the strip. This place doesn't disappoint.  I ordered the Ultimate Steak and Eggs and it was delicious.  Ribeye was a generous portion cooked perfectly, hash browns where seasoned well.  I started off with the pot of bread and it was decent.  Decor is very nice and the waitresses wear pajamas.  The service was excellent as well.  The only drawbacks were that the water cups were dirty and the tables were not leveled so they were rocking back and forth quite a bid.  Overall I would definitely recommend and come back."}
{"text":"Cool breakfast spot in Southern Highlands! Everyone is nice and the PJ's are a great touch. Good food, tastes fresh, great for families and children. Request Amanda, she is friendly and polite! Great service! Definitely one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Try the red velvet pancakes-they are awesome.  Great omelets too. Service is prompt and courteous"}
{"text":"The corned beef hash was edible, but I would not order it again. 

The pot of bread is worth every penny as well as the fresh squeezed OJ. 

The coffee is acceptable, but not great."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I am still so amazed on everything about this location place. Amazing food and the staff is so friendly and you can really tell how well they all work together. I highly recommend this place! And the banana pineapple smoothies are the shizzz nizzz"}
{"text":"Great food and service!!!  Amber is out favorite server always with a smile and good food!!! Had the red velvet  pancakes that come highly recommended they were fantastic. Can't wait to go back next month!"}
{"text":"The servers wearing pajamas is original and the french press coffee is a refreshing option for this side of town.

We had high hopes for this restaurant, but unfortunately the menu serves up cheap ingredients to its patrons (for the exception of the Illy coffee) and the cooks fall short on preparing food properly.  

At a price point of $10-$15 for breakfast, they should know how to cook eggs properly.  Nothing irritates us more than when a cook makes two cheap/small eggs (over medium)  together on an extremely high heat using a bright yellow colored fat  (margarine?).  The plate was loaded with what appeared to be nasty refined margarine or oil.  I soaked up two napkins full of this nasty stuff.  We were delivered two rounds of this type of cooking and just gave up.  The hash browns that we ordered as golden (as opposed to raw in oil) were flash fried.  Disgusting and half hearted presentation.  Seriously, Robert Irvine would have hit the roof if he was ever served this food.  

We also ordered  pancakes that were loaded with artificial vanilla extract.  I've tasted better frozen pancakes than the chemical cakes cakes served at this restaurant.
Sorry but it's true. Very disappointing.

If money is no object and you don't care about what's in the food that you put into your body, this is your place.

If you really want to have a top shelf breakfast with amazing ingredients, visit EAT downtown.  It is so worth the drive and your body will thank you for it."}
{"text":"So yummy! Cup o bread was so good and not overly sweet. Chill and laid back location...love the pajamas!"}
{"text":"We drove from Los Angeles and we were yelping for a good breakfast spot. We came across this place and it was delicious. Everything we had tasted great!! Will definitely come here again when in town."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Love the \"bread in a cup\" which is actually a cinnamon roll baked in cup with frosting on the side! TO DIE FOR! My favorite breakfast is the ham and eggs Benedict, what makes this special is the drizzle of balsamic on the hollandaise sauce, perfect poached eggs. Sliced ham instead of Canadian bacon! Awesome! My friend had other things and cleaned their plates!
Will be back, Maria is the one who helped me decide on the bread in a cup and I'm so glad she did! Great service! Thanks Maria!"}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast. I keep getting their french toast. The syrup is just so good and the coffee is amazing. :)"}
{"text":"Good food, just a little expensive.  Almost as much as the prices on the strip.  Sitting on the weekend is a little tight, nice and clean place."}
{"text":"Yummmm!
Breakfast here was absolutely delightful. The restaurant is cute because they have sunflowers on the ceiling and the servers are dressed in pjs, which makes it the perfect lighthearted and pleasant place to eat breakfast.

The pancakes were great!

The bread in a cup was delicious!

The orange juice was so fresh!"}
{"text":"Terrific place opened up a few months ago for breakfast/brunch.  The food is delicious and plentiful and reasonably priced.  We have eaten there several times now and have not been disappointed.   There is something for every palate on the menu from voracious meat eater to vegan.   Service is excellent. Today Maria was a star holding down the fort almost single handedly and taking good care of our 3 person table.

The menu is extensive and full of tasty choices.  I've eaten the Salmon Bagel (egg, spinach, salmon, cream cheese, capers, onion on The Works bagel) with outrageous french fries.  We ordered watermelon strawberry juice - squeezed fresh. Pancakes that melted in your mouth. Benedict that sat ontop of a hunk of perfectly cooked thick and juicy steak. 

Service is attentive, engaged, courteous and funny as the waiters wear their favorite pajamas taking and delivering one's orders.  The seating is comfortable and the decor is light and happy feeling.  Shirts and other merchandise that will bring a smile to your face is available for sale as well.   Rise & Shine has become one of our \"go-to\" breakfast and brunch restaurants.   It is hidden away in a small \"strip mall\" area, but well worth discovering.  We commend Rise & Shine to you - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just due to the cleanliness could be better come on this place rocks breakfast and service but if that Fifth star I know breakfast places are busy, we've owned one but first impressions??? Ya know, defiantly a staple morning spot and I love the service and speed. Just buss a little betters all I'm saying"}
{"text":"Must have - pot of bread and the French press coffee. Food is always tasty, service leaves a little bit to be desired. Think the service in pajamas makes the experience a little too casual. Go with patience as there will be a wait on weekend mornings!"}
{"text":"This was a pretty good restaurant. Portions were very large and offered a good value. Everything tasted good, but not great. The waffle was the best thing we ordered. The chilaquiles were decent, but we've definitely had better."}
{"text":"New fave breakfast spot!!!! Steak and eggs, pancakes, French toast, bagel and lox, biscuits and gravy, breakfast burrito, Bloody Mary w/ bacon?! Whatever you want, they've got it AND YUM!!!! Amazing service from all. Maria, Sharon, and Lauren are awe-mazing. Atmosphere is friendly, a great way to start any day!!!!"}
{"text":"After reading about the wait most people have at Babycakes Cafe I decided to give another breakfast place a try (I'll try Babycakes one day...). So I Yelped a spot and was instantly intrigued by Rise and Shine. It was the location-not far from where I live- and those darn cute flower umbrellas that they have hanging from their ceiling.
It was busy but with a ten minute wait on a Sunday Morning I'm not complaining....The flower umbrellas were so cute and everytime the door opened the air spinned some of them around-Whimsical I tell ya!!!
Anyways, I did also enjoy all the mosaics on the walls as well-Artsie!!!

The food= An option for bread is a cinnamon bread baked in a flower pot with a knife stabbed in the top served with butter and strawberry jam. Let me tell ya one is not enough- It was so good but I wish those flower pots were fatter for more darn warm yummy bread. Cute idea though...
I loved reading that the Chicken in the Chicken and Waffles was a chicken breast-YAY!!!!!! So I picked that and it was really good. The breading was pretty tasty and spicy as well and the chicken breast was pounded flat so you got a pretty big piece. My daughter got a short stack of pancakes-So fluffy and good too...Now on to the grumpy BF who already was having attitude-He got eggs,hash browns and bacon-He was not impressed and hated his bacon-Oh well, so sad....I tried his food and it was fine he is just too particular about his bacon but like I told him thats why you have a voice use it and request what you like!!!
I will be back and the BF can wait in the car...."}
{"text":"On December 8 we came in at 2 o'clock. 

Expectations were extremely high as I have heard of this place for years and their pot of bread is infamous in this area of town. 
We felt neglected by our server as we had to ask Passer- by servers for silverware and refills. 

My wife ordered the biscuits and gravy with Hash Browns lightly cooked and they came burnt. I like crunchy and dark, but they were burnt. 
She also asked for hot cocoa to be X X X HOT, came out hot,  Maybe it's a legal issue, wish they would've microwave that. 

My waffle had excellent flavor just a little mushy, but the biggest disappointment of the whole meal was
The pot of bread had been sitting on the shelf for a while, and we watched the server take it from the shelf to the kitchen and microwave it. You know how bread gets chewy after the microwave; that's what it tasted like!   I would've rather had it at room temperature.  Very Disappointing. 

The server did without hesitation refund the money for the biscuits and gravy and the bread. I truly want to believe this was a server issue and not a restaurant issue, the problem was our Extremely high expectations."}
{"text":"Delicious food that is worth the long wait. We have tried everything from pancakes to biscuits and gravy and their dishes have all been winners. 

Check out the cute little gift shop. Fun stuff!

Also, there is a fresh juice bar. Yum!"}
{"text":"We tried this breakfast place finally and we all are highly impressed!! The food was actually pretty good!! I highly recommend to try their freshly squeezed juices!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is on a downhill path and they need to fix it. Based on the recent reviews and my recent experience everyone seems to agree. The wait time are out of control. Really waiting over an hour for breakfast!  The wait times are caused from poor table management. There is no sense of urgency. Tables are left dirty, servers are not moving the flow and customers are left waiting.

This was a very disappointing experience"}
{"text":"We just ate at Rise and Shine for the first time. We plan to make it a regular stop. All 7 of us loved the food. The pancakes were incredible. Same with the steak omelette. Our server, Maria was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast this morning. Will NOT be going back. The food was very good and the service/staff was amazing. But breakfast for 2 adults and a 1 1/2 year old was $50.00!!!!!!! Unbelievable!!!! Belgium waffle the thickness of about 2 pancakes was $8.00 and to add maybe HALF a banana was $2.00. Omelette was $8.50 and to make it with egg whites and add bell peppers was $5.00!!!!! And the bell peppers were MISSING and there was very little egg. Babies food was 1 pancake, 2 eggs and 2 pieces of bacon for $6.00. Not bad. That's about average. Again, the food is amazing. But the price is WAY to much for the little that you get. Will drive all the way to Jamm's for something almost as good and A LOT more food for a reasonable price (even with paying for gas we will be ahead of the game)."}
{"text":"My husband, son and two friends flew into Vegas Sunday night.  We had a hard time trying to find food late and had to settle for a wing joint.  I opted not to have any food there and so by morning, I was starving.  Looked on Yelp and found this place.

Really cute decor and wait staff in PJ's,, very charming.  We had an excellent waitress that took very good care of us, always very attentive.  I would say the table ordered just about every type of breakfast for the table.  From pancakes, omelets, oatmeal, bacon/eggs and potatoes.  Everything was delicious and filling.  My meal came with the pot of bread which I loved.  Half cinnamon roll and half dinner roll.  Yummy, although is wish it was bigger.

My only negative is that I was a little pricey.  This place is in a shopping plaza not anywhere near the strip (which was our intention).  I felt I was a bit expensive for what I perceived to be a local place to dine.  Since we did eat late for breakfast we were good until, dinner, no lunch required!  Very filling!

If you want to splurge order the fresh squeezed OJ.  Pricey at $3.25 a glass but tasted fresh and it was fabulous!"}
{"text":"This place is nice. It doesn't feel like how you see it from the outside. When you get in you already feel comfortable. It is clean and most of all we had a very friendly server - Lisa. Each of us tried something different and everyone were pretty satisfied with what they had. Overall it was a great atmosphere, great food and great experience. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Was kind of disappointed that they had run out of corn beef hash at 10:15 so I had to order something else. But I ordered the build your own omelet and it was great! Also their old fashioned pancakes were great. Very family-oriented. The wait for my food felt like forever though, but it was probably because I was really hungry haha. I got my food like 30mins later so idk if that's typical."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm a fan...As we walked in I noticed the worker wearing pajamas which I thought was different and cool at the same time...The menu was can be a bit overwhelming at first, but thanks to our server who was so kind to go the menu, which made it easier to narrow the selection down. A must to order cup-of-bread and be sure to eat while it still nice and warm."}
{"text":"The food is adequate for the price, not worth waiting more than four minutes for a table though.  GIven the service, you might be better off grabbing grub from the supermarket and/or starbucks across the parking lot.

The service falls squarely in the I-have-more-important-things-to-do-so-just-deal-with-waiting-and-be-happy-when-I-eventually-pay-enough-attention-to-you-to-drop-the-check category.

Three visits: cumulative duration of 90 minutes
 - I ordered coffee immediately each time when the waitress finally found a moment to greet me, total pricetag: $8
 - I drain my mug immediately - in 3-5 minutes.
 - I spent a total of 70 minutes with a totally empty mug on my table
 - to make a point on the final visit, I left the mug overhanging the far/waitresss-side of the table
 - On 2/3 visits the mug finally got refilled when they dropped the check - the definition of a minimal effort at service
 - On the final visit, no refill at all."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in southern highlands. Fresh food, decent service depending on how busy it is but the fact that the food is amazing makes up for the mediocre service. Its hit and miss with service I have been there 10 times or so and I have had good and bad service but always amazing food. Its a way better ihop or dennys is the best way to describe it. My family and I always come here for breakfast. Its way better quality than dennys or ihop. Becareful going to late because it can get very busy. My family and I go early so its usually never too busy."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We usually go to the other rise and shine. Our server was MARIA! She was so friendly and awesome server.  We got our food right away. And it was perfect and delicious. We will definitely come back soon"}
{"text":"It's my second time here, and I think everything is delicious. The blueberry pancakes are fluffy and buttery to perfection, and the eggs Benedict is absolutely divine. 

The service is good, but it's definitely an area for improvement. They're quick, but a few times the waitress forgot my order and didn't refill our drinks. Overall, I'd say this place is a thumbs up."}
{"text":"Maria's service was impeccable!! Everything was delicious!!!! Mimosas on a Saturday morning is the way to start!!! Be back soon!!!  I would love to go to work in my pajamas!!! Everyone was really nice!!!"}
{"text":"This was our second time coming here. It is a bit unique as everyone knows that the wait staff wears pajamas. Okay, that is cute. The upside down umbrellas hanging from the ceiling are cute and colorful. 

We decided to split a Steak and Chorizo burrito and Corned Beef Hash. Our waitress was really nice, and brought waters to the table before we even placed our order. 

The burrito was huge and looked amazing. We cut into it and began eating. The steak was perfectly cooked at medium-rare. The more we ate though, we did not find any chorizo. There were eggs, but no chorizo. We figured that maybe we got the wrong order, but I didn't see any other steak breakfast burrito on the menu. So that was a bummer. it was still tasty, but not what we were looking forward to having. The Corned Beef Hash was good. It was seasoned differently than any other we have had up to this point, and because of this it kind of threw us off somehow. 

It was very loud in here for breakfast. The entrance is very awkward and cramped as well. Immediately inside the door there are benches on either side. There is nowhere to stand, only to sit. While paying, people are coming in and being led to their seats. I went to wait outside because I was constantly having to move out the way of incoming customers and the wait staff. Behind the register is the door that leads out to the patio. It is just a very small area, with a lot going on all at once.

Although the food was decent, the experience itself was just okay."}
{"text":"I'm so sad to give two stars :( the only reason I gave two stars is because some of the staff are really great (: but every time I order food from there they seem to get annoyed if it's over the phone, even sometimes in person. And I feel like something is always wrong with the order. For example, I don't understand how rare and well done can get confused. It's just a bunch of stuff that has added up that gets them a bad review from me. And some of the stuff scares me to know if it was true or not.

To add;
The last order I got they didn't give us a receipt that told us the break down, but If the steak and eggs are really as much as they say on the menu, they charged us 15$ for a simple salad with lettuce, chicken and a poorly sliced tomato. :("}
{"text":"As good as it gets in Vegas for breakfast!  Breakfast joints in Vegas are hard to find let alone good ones especially of the strip, so when I found this place a little over a year ago I was pleasantly surprised!  (They only serve breakfast and lunch here, by the way)
Simply put, EVERYTHING is GREAT here!  
I recommend this place all the time!
Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Customer service was amazing! The food was pretty good. I wish I would have ordered the red velvet pancakes though."}
{"text":"Piss poor management when you only have TWO servers on a national holiday...line out the door...and you tell us its only a 20 minute wait.  Crock o shit"}
{"text":"This could be a 5 if not for our server, Amber.  We found this restaurant on Yelp, and with the near ease of our Navigation system, managed our way to the restaurant.  We were seated almost immediately, which was great since about 20 people showed up in the next 15 minutes or so.  After waiting far too long to be greeted at our table, I walked up and asked the hostess if there was someone assigned to our table.  She said yes, and that she would go find her.  She returned in just a couple of minutes to say that the server must be in the bathroom, and offered to get us started with coffee.  We told her that we were in a hurry to order because we were trying to get out of town and back home (who'da guessed we were in for a 6-1/2 hour traffic jam all the way back to San Diego) to our kids.  She suggested that she could take our breakfast order and get everything started until our server was able.  And she did.  Amber appeared on scene a few minutes later.  We knew it was our server, because the hostess was going over our order with her, and because we hadn't seen her before.  She was either sick or just unhappy to be there, and her demeanor when she did finally come to our table reflected that.  Her energy, or lack thereof, was the counter balance to all the other busy bees.  In fact, she even dropped one of the pots of bread on an adjacent table.  Our food was served by another server - who we are guessing was either the owner or manager.  She was extremely pleasant, and the food was delicious.  We asked Amber for our check - again, because we were trying to get out quickly - and it took her several minutes to drop it.  I was just about to go up to the hostess stand to request it when she dropped it on the table.  When she noticed I already had cash in my hand, Amber did offer to go to the register and cash it out for us.  We didn't take her up on it, but that was something.  I would have just liked to have seen some degree of service before we were on our way out the door.  This was our first trip to Las Vegas in more than 10 years, so it's unlikely that we will be going back soon.  But if we were in town again, I would absolutely return for breakfast.  The food was delicious, and with the exception of our one service experience, everyone else seemed very accommodating."}
{"text":"If you are not a local and you rely on taxi to get around, then you might be better off renting a vehicle for the day. If you stay at the Mirage hotel, parking is free. Otherwise, you will come off the pockets for taxi because it is off the beaten path from the strip. 

We waited for a good 39 min (which is a good sign) and glad we did because the red velvet pancakes were delicious!!!!! Comes with 4 pancakes so it is a shareable plate. The breading on the chicken (chix & waffle) was sweet. 

If you don't have a microwave in your hotel room, the pancakes still taste amazing without heating it up."}
{"text":"I'm from California and love going to breakfast places. The food was amazing, it has flavor! Our waitress was kind and funny. The only reason I don't give this restaurant a 5, is because it took them almost 30 mins to get my food."}
{"text":"Best breakfast brunch place!  Their chicken and waffles is to die for, and I love decor and service (who wear cute pajama uniforms). It's like a modern diner feel, and everyone is so friendly. Get their early because by 8:30am it starts getting pack!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for breakfast in Vegas. Love the service, love the food! Chill relaxed environment!  Our top pick for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast and brunch place, with cool decor and friendly staff. On Sunday afternoon around 1pm, my fiancé and I were in the mood for some breakfast, so we decided to try this place.

The food was delicious and it didn't take long after we ordered to receive our food. We both ordered the massive chicken and waffle. I also ordered a side of potatoes and he had a side of biscuits and gravy.

I liked how the maple syrup had two or three sticks of cinnamon inside, and the great choices to choose from on the menu.

When I have visitors in town, I am defiantly bringing them here for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere! The waitresses wear pajamas and they sell funny shirts and socks in the front. Also the decor is definitely original. The food is absolutely amazing. The steak is tender and cooked well. No complaints here, I'll definitely be coming here again soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing for people lactose intolerant or non meat eaters. Super unhelpful staff trying to find something, anything on the menu to eat. Super expensive to get a 1/8 cup of strawberries for 2.50. Overall terrible experience."}
{"text":"First and last visit nothing to come back for.
The coffee is bitter the hasbrowns are soaked in grease 30 min wait with tables available for the entire hour I was there. I can get this poor quality anywhere."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place after seeing all the good reviews, but sadly this was not the case. 3 of us went today for breakfast-1 got the Cinnamon crusted french toast,which was gross tasting-1-got the Red Velvet pancakes-those were okay, had better- and 1 got the NY strip steak and eggs, the steak looked more like a rib eye that was super thin. If your going to say your a \"steak & egg\" place your meat should be better quality especially when you are charging $13.25. The first 2 cups of coffee were warm. The pot of bread was okay-too much of a yeast taste for me. Service was okay, even though our waitress got our order mixed up with the table next to us-which might explain why the steak was not right. For 3 of us it cost over $40 for breakfast-definitely was not worth it. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Better bring an extra shirt for breakfast because this place is deeeeeeeeelicious.
Great service, all you can drink coffee, comfy seating!"}
{"text":"We love this breakfast place! We eat here every weekend. The food is consistently tasty. Everybody is friendly. The servers wear pj's and are friendly and efficient! The host, hostess, and cashier are nice! The upside down spinning umbrellas are super cute! We try to get in before the lines start (after 10:00 AM). Our only complaints are there are (1) only 2 bathrooms for such a big restaurant, (2) it can get a little noisy with the radio on a high volume in the kitchen, and (3) the location of the register is a little awkward when checking out. It is right next to the door and is a combination register/hostess desk. So, when it gets busy and a line starts forming for incoming new customers and the exiting customers checking out, it gets a little hectic and jammed. They've recently expanded, and could possibly put the register and exit at the new door. This way the entrance (main door) is just for the hostess and the exiting door could be designated as the register/checking out area."}
{"text":"I think we found our Vegas morning spot! Red Velvet pancakes were insane! Only drawback being that the whip cream wasn't homemade, but from a can. Be what can you expect at that price? Great service as well."}
{"text":"I was hoping this place would be good but sadly no. My omelette was very runny, my husbands breakfast sandwich was very small and flavorless. Nothing special about this place and overpriced. Go to Egg Works instead."}
{"text":"oOoOoh so good!

My son and I split the bacon wrapped filet w/ egg and cheddar cheese. I'm not a big meat eater but I sure did enjoy myself when I ate this plate of goodness!

Lots of flavor and nice atmosphere. We've returned twice since this particular visit. Try it, you'll like it ;)"}
{"text":"I would recommend this restaurant. The service was very good. Our waitress, Laura is an adorable brunette , very personable and very efficient. She had us in absolute stitches .Our food was very good, price was fair. The restaurant itself is cute, as far as atmosphere goes.  I'd come back if she was working."}
{"text":"FRESH SQUEEZED orange juice, great selection of food, get the \"cup of bread\" for your side. If you hate Ihop and Denny's you'll LOVE IT HERE!"}
{"text":"Our party of 2 arrived Sunday morning around 10 AM. We were told 20 mins for a table and got our table exactly 20 mins later. 

Service was ok, not overly attentive but there when it was needed. 

Had the Texas French toast  and chicken and waffles, both were just ok and average. 

For the price and service it was all just ok."}
{"text":"Their orange juice is freshly squeezed, thats one of the things I really liked about them. The restaurant has a cute theme, the pink flowers in the ceiling were rotating. The staff are all wearing jammies lol 

The restaurant is clean except for a few tables that weren't cleaned, probably because they didnt have enough people for that big place.

I'm not one to complain- but the service sucked. Also, they had 3 wifi connections and they cant even share it. Lol food is ok, nothing really special about it. We had corned beef hash and biscuits and gravy. Maybe next time I'll try their steak and eggs."}
{"text":"1st timers here. Food was excellent. Best toast ever. Laura our sever was outstanding and friendly. Always checked up on us. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Great find.  On our way out to Zion and stopped off the freeway and found this gem.  Lots of healthy options and incredibly sized portions. Vanessa was attentive and nice and very helpful. The cooks in the back that you could see were doing a great job throwing it down and not taking any shortcuts. Will definitely come here again the next time we drive through."}
{"text":"GREAT breakfast,  and the pressed coffee is wonderful.  

We come from southern California,  and always have breakfast at Rise and Shine.  Best in Vegas"}
{"text":"My go-to breakfast place! I love the Bagel Sandwiches, they are huge, so it'll probably be your breakfast and lunch. Also, the Cinnamon French toast Crunch is the bomb! I get a half plate of that and make a platter with some eggs, so I'm not too sugar-carbed out for the day.

Noise level is decent as long as they keep the radio down a bit. When it's too loud, the patrons get louder to talk over it... it's a never ending cycle. But it's very RARELY too loud, maybe 1 in 20 visits :P Only brought this up after going through the survey questions.

Also, would love to see them move the checkout register over to the door in the new wing to keep the Check-in crowd and check out crowd sperate. But it's worth the line, even if they don't. :)"}
{"text":"I was trying to find a reason to give this place less than 5 stars, and I couldn't! (It's Nov 17, and they already have Christmas music playing. I love that sort of thing, but maybe those who think it's too early for all this festive cheer may dock a star.)

Shannon our server was so sweet!!  Almost as sweet as the freshly squeezed OJ. (You have to get a glass of this stuff!!)

We ordered the biscuits and gravy, which tasted great!  The biscuits weren't too doughy, and they were covered in that quintessential Midwestern gravy.

Also had the double fisted crispy chicken bagel sandwich.  They weren't kidding when they named this thing. It was giant, with a tender piece of friend chicken, scrambled eggs, melted provolone, spinach, AND bacon!!! I got it on an everything bagel. 

If you want a satisfying and flavorful breakfast off the strip, this is your place."}
{"text":"Today was a Horrible Experience!!! We were not even served because our Service Dog (for none of the waitresses business) was told he's not a service dog!!! I will be telling everyone to not come here due to this!! I have 1.6 million followers on Instagram soo this is just a start!!! Not Veteran friendly"}
{"text":"This place was delicious and fun. The servers were dressed in pajamas. I ordered the eggs Benedict with hash brown. It was yummy. Their coffee is great and it's a cute place to get breakfast. Portions are pretty big so I think it's shareable. Next time I'll come back in pajamas as well. Haha"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp on our way home from Vegas.  So cute, great service and delicious food. Super fun menu."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Food is great. I had the ham and eggs Benedict. Hash browns are very good too."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened and I must say today SUCKED!!! The only positive thing is that the food came out fast. The servers look and talk unprofessional and extremely unkept. I didn't get offered anything as my side besides hash browns no fruit or anything. Didn't get checked on the entire time I was eating. I'm just mad cause they jacked up their prices so much I expect better service not worse service."}
{"text":"While I gather their food is good it is still just breakfast. You can make most of what they sell in your own kitchen for a 10th of the cost. 

Nice restaurant decent food but the prices are way too high. 

Me my wife and 2 boys. Almost $70!!"}
{"text":"Cute place always busy.  Always our pick when we have a large group, very big menu everything comes out fast!   Wish they would have more vegan choices tho"}
{"text":"I thought I had a great CFS yesterday and I did, but today I had an even better one at Rise & Shine.  The steak's breaking was very flakey and light.  Not too heavy.  The gravy was served on the side with the eggs sunny up on the steak and hash browns.  The steak looked nice and crispy without the gravy smothering it.  The hash was crispy and the portions are huge.  They also serve French pressed coffee, but I brought my own Starbucks.  I think next time, I'll try their French press coffee.  They also have a thing called bread in a pot as a substitute for toast.  It's literally some bread in a flower pot.  It's combo of various breads/rolls.  I opted for the plain biscuit which was very good, but small in comparison to what you get in a bread pot.  I didn't finish my meal, so the biscuit was just fine.  The only complaint I could have is the sunny up eggs had a bit too much raw whites, but that's okay. It's just more gravy for the hash browns when mixed with the yolk.  I would rank this CFS right up there with Maple Tree."}
{"text":"This place is awesomeness in its entirety, minus it's tucked away. That could be a good thing though. The decor is delightful (pics to follow) and the staff is wonderful! Usually they have a wait but today people must be bbqing. One thing that stands out
about this cafe as opposed to others is that it's family owned & run and they wear pajamas while serving you. Love it! Riley was a fantastic server. She was helpful with suggestions and a joy to have. I'm a fan, this place is consistently on point. If you're in the southwest side of town, you must give them a try. Definitely in Vegas' top brunch spots!"}
{"text":"Had the ultimate steak breakfast.  Ribeye, eggs, and hashbrowns. It was very good. The steak wasnt as fatty as I usually like when I grill myself, but still very good. The hashbrowns and eggs were awesome. Fresh squeezed oj was great."}
{"text":"Henderson just can't get enough brunch spots. They have been popping up like crazy over the last couple of years and I love it.

We stopped in around noon on a Saturday and to our surprise there was no wait for a table. Our waitress was over quickly to greet us and take our orders. She was friendly and continued to check in us during our meal.

The Pot of Bread sounded intriguing so we shared that to start. It is a combination of a cinnamon roll and a roll. The combination of a sweet and a non-sweet is perfect. The frosting to go on top was delicious. 

I had the Spice-Rubbed Rib Eye Steak Chilaquiles. This was very good. Their presentation was like a deconstructed chilaquiles and while I wasn't a fan of the presentation I did love the flavor of everything. The steak had a great seasoning and enough fat to additionally flavor the steak. The chips also had a nice seasoning and the perfect amount of cheese coating them. 

My husband as always ordered the better of the two entrees, the Southern Style Chicken Fried NY Steak. The fried steak was perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. The gravy on top was delicious. I would definitely order this entrée on a return visit."}
{"text":"I've been to both locations; both are a great way to start the morning! Today I ordered the fancy steak omelette and tried the Lox Bagel special. The steak was cooked Med-Rare. I was very impressed by the Lox bagel, which has capers and perfectly cooked bacon. I also ordered a side of fruit, which was probably the most disappointing part of my meal (only because Mr. Mamas and Egg Works have such a good portion with no up charge.) I left very full and satisfied."}
{"text":"This place was such a delight, from the decor, food, and the service. Lisa was awesome. I felt like I was eating in her kitchen. The bread pot was delicious. They have the cutest lights that were daisy umbrellas. I would definitely come back. It was a lot of food I'm sad I didn't have a place to store and reheat my chilaquiles because I was staying in a hotel."}
{"text":"The food at this place was delicious! The portions were huge and the price was reasonable. Our server, Ashley (look for the girl with the pancake printed pajamas) was super friendly and very attentive. It was our first time there and she answered all of our questions and made recommendations. She made conversation with everyone at the table and made sure we had what we needed. I recommend coming here. Friendly staff and delicious food. Plus they have a variety of freshly squeezed juices."}
{"text":"First impressions lasting impressions.
The place is decorated whimsically with soothing colors and hanging umbrellas. 
The wait staff are wearing pajamas! ...very clever.
The wait on this particular Sunday morning was reasonable with a sunny outside patio.

The menu choices were abundant and varietal. 
I'm having pancakes \"plattered\" which adds 2 eggs, meat, and something else.

This place specializes in steak and eggs by the way, which my three companions ordered and took great delight in. I ran an obstacle marathon (Spartan Race) and am craving carbs something terrible.

Side note: this neighborhood is gorgeous, you'll notice all of the trees as soon as you are here; very beautiful."}
{"text":"Rise & Shine is very cute! The wait staff looks like they just rolled out of bed (they serve in pajama attire) and it adds to the overall charm and theme of this place. Interior decor is very cute as well.

Service was exceptional from the hostess to our server - no complaints here! 

Why 3 stars? 

Corn beef hash was a very small serving size and I've had better. The breakfast burrito was huge but tasted okay. One thing to note is that the retried beans were EXTRA salty. Maybe it was just a bad batch but it was horribly salty and the part of it that touched the burrito made my burrito super salty. I'm usually a fan of breakfast burritos so I was disappointed here. 

We got banana pancakes as well - this was delicious! The pancakes were the highlight of the meal, but otherwise the food was okay. 

Prices were a little on the high side in my opinion, especially for mediocre food (with the exception of banana pancakes).

My overall experience was good, but the food - I'm not sure if I'd come back because I didn't have anything that stood out."}
{"text":"Open up around the corner so I thought I'd try it. I know the food was excellent because I wasn't that hungry and I ate the eggs benedict in about 5 minutes. Delicious... the service was good the food even better the only negative thing it's a little pricey for breakfast. Too bad because I'd be here every day."}
{"text":"Food was so good! One of the best breakfast meals ... and the service was amazing ! Will definitely come by next time in Vegas"}
{"text":"The flavors just did not work,  had to send back my bloody Mary,  was not good.  Had high hopes,  but will not return."}
{"text":"I come here rarely when I absolutely refuse to make my own eggs. I have eaten here several times, but the most recent one to date... I ordered a special egg white omelet with specific ingredients. I came about 35 minutes after I ordered the food. I was fine to eat the food... But they had thrown it away and offered to just make a new one no charge. I was very appreciative..(I just always have a fear of cooks doing something to the food in orders like these.) but I accepted and it was quite delicious. Maybe a little runny. But sizzling hot and I guess as good and as exciting as an egg white omelet can get.... 

One thing I'd like to note... I know it's 'their thing' to run around in their PJs. All the servers etc... But when I come in there sometimes it looks really messy. I see people in their PJs. 3 tables that still haven't been bussed and crumbs everywhere. Just something they might want to take note to. Also, the cooks and servers are always shouting to one another from across the room... Because the cooks station is open to the restaurant. (You'd understand this layout I'm mentioning if you've actually eaten here).  

BUT.... It you are in the area, they have consistently good breakfast food and always seem to be pretty busy. All servers I've ever had have been nice... Some of the hostesses make me nervous... Like I have to be reallyyyyy nice to them because they're having an 'off' day. I know we all know what I'm talking about here. K hope everyone else enjoys !!"}
{"text":"This place is very spacious. Me and my aunt went on a Sunday and had a little bit of a wait but the food makes up for it. It's reasonably priced except for the drinks. The oj is about $5 a glass. My aunt had the French pressed coffee which she says is the best coffee she's had in her entire life. A must go"}
{"text":"We came to this place with our son and d-in-law, and wow! The staff is so cool - friendly, helpful, offering suggestions to newcomers. When you come, ask for Lisa or Riley. But heck, all the staff seems great. 

The decor is incredibly imaginative. The ceiling fans all have umbrella-like covers that are large flower prints - dahlias, chrysanthemums, others. The wall colors are vibrant. Located in a strip mall, the restaurant is modest size. It's also quite popular, so don't be surprised to wait for a table.

However long your wait, it's worth it. The food is sublime. Rise and Shine bills itself as a steak-and-eggs place, so I ordered steak and eggs. My half pound ribeye was perfectly done and just great flavor. I asked Lisa the secret. She said the steaks are seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and coffee grounds. She said the delicious hash browns had the same seasonings except substitute shallots for coffee grounds. 

Your order comes with a choice of breads: get the \"pot of bread,\" as unique an offering as there is. It's a cinnamon roll baked in a coffee cup. Tip the cup and out comes the roll; apply butter and enjoy!

Chicken and waffles is also on the menu; the waffle is light and terrific with the cinnamon-infused syrup. The chicken breast is pounded thin, breaded and flash fried to a crispy delight, moist and tender and not greasy at all. 

How about the coffee: choose from an Italian blend, or French press. The French press comes with a three-tube hourglass that allows you to gauge the strength of your coffee. 

An important part of the dining experience is your server. He or she can make or break your meal. The servers here are clad in pajamas which are colorful and clearly comfortable. Lisa was an integral part of our experience. She engaged with us, laughed, joked, teased and was teased in return. She took excellent care of us. 

In a city full of great restaurants and celebrity chefs, this small family owned and operated restaurant is a gem."}
{"text":"Maria was a great server loved her pajamas very attentive and the food was great came out quickly.  Great place to try on our visit to Vegas :)."}
{"text":"The food is the best.  We were here for 3 days and ate there every morning!  Amber was a Really good waitress!! Salmon eggs Benedict.... Wow!!!!"}
{"text":"Pot o  bread and servers in pj's. Good for breakfast or lunch. Always have the fresh squeezed juice and french press coffee.  Food is always good. Gets very busy on weekends but they have a nice spot to hang outside."}
{"text":"The breakfast was excellent! The service was awesome, Vanessa is the best! We always request her to be our server. 

Our favorites are the country fried steak and 2/3 egg breakfast but can literally recommend any of it!"}
{"text":"Bomb bomb bomb! Uploaded pictures. My boss used to eat heere when they first opened and said it used to be better but idk. Pretty bomb. I've had the eggs Benedict before and today I have the bacon wrapped tenders with eggs. Twas uhmazing. The waitress today wasn't as nice as my last but everyone else was super friendly. Older people tend to be judge me and my friends but it's whatever. It's her tip. Other than that the resteraunt and food itself is clean and bomb."}
{"text":"Sometimes after a weekend in Vegas, you just want to get out ASAP especially if you have a long drive home. We all have our exodus go to spots. Many of us want to cure our hang-overs so we head to Chinatown for Pho. Some want to get that steak and eggs for under $10 at smaller hotels. Few of us want to load up at a buffet before having to sit in that strenuous car ride and hoping that we can make it home before we have to drop the kiddies off at the pool. On the most previous occasion out to Sin City, I suggested something a little different to the crew. Let's check out this place called Rise & Shine, a Steak & Egg Place which is kind of south of the strip and sort of in the path back to LA. It seemed like the majority of the people who dined here were regulars and/or locals. 

This little restaurant is open daily from 7am-3pm only. They serve breakfast items the entire time during their hours of operation and lunch menu kicks in at 11:30am. We arrived right before noon on Sunday. For our party of seven, it took nearly 20 minutes for them to get us a table. The place isn't really big to begin with. I would say that 4-5 people max per table is ideal. There is a dining counter and you can also eat outside if the weather permits. Take notice of the waitresses' uniform; they're catchy because they are wearing pajamas. An awesome concept and it looks very comfortable. The bus boys have black tee shirts on that say something along the lines of help them by visiting Yelp.

We all ended up ordering hefty breakfast dishes on this morning because we were all mc-fatties ready to go to town. I went with the Crunchy Cinnamon Raisin French Toast - cinnamon crunch coasted, served with a warm glass bottle of maple syrup ($8.95). I made it a platter by adding two eggs and a turkey kielbasa (bacon or sausage is also avail) for an extra $3.50. It was a big meal indeed. The French toast was soft but not mushy and full of flavors from the cinnamon and tang of the raisins. The big turkey kielbasa was a nice compliment with the eggs. Surely French toast by itself isn't sufficient. I was definitely a happy camper.

A couple of my friends got the Crispy Fried Chicken Breast & Waffle ($11.95) which was a hit on the table. A thick piece of battered chicken breast sitting on top a fluffy waffle. Juicy white meat and far from dry. It's nothing like Roscoe's Carol C. Special but it should deserve recognition of its own. Before you start bashing me by saying, \"I've had better fried chicken Smitcha!\" All I'm saying is that it's pretty good and never did I claim it was the best I've had. 

Another friend ordered the Southern Style Chicken Fried Steak but from what I heard, he wasn't too impressed and felt like he should've went with the fried chicken and waffles.

Service was on point and like an oldskool coffee shop, I took my tab and paid at the register. I regret not trying pot of bread that everyone seems to be rave about on Yelp. Bring your appetite to this place because after this meal, I was seriously full until later that night. Plus, there are many options to choose from their menu. I will say that it was a great meal but it also made me feel like I was good on a typical American breakfast for some time. Once in a while a 1500+ calorie, single serving meal is okay but just not too often or else Dr. Chen will start chewing me out about my weight and high blood pressure."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, generous portions, and friendly service. The decor and personality of this place is refreshing. A place I'd visit again and again."}
{"text":"Help us...Yelp us!! WILL DO!! And DONE! Always excellent service and  love that it's close to home. I even got my birthday coupon in the mail and I am SUPER excited to use it!!"}
{"text":"There food is good, service is excellent- price is average.  But there bread in a pot is to die for... I could go there and only eat that and be a happy camper!"}
{"text":"Good food but just way way too expensive for breakfast. 1 breakfast and 1 child breakfast with drink and 1 iced tea, $28! Plus tip."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. I have never been disappointed. The waitresses are super friendly and personable. Even the young lady at the register was very social. Great atmosphere and good off the strip location."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT . 
The flavors were AMAZING & I'm picky because I cook a lot . Our waitress Vanessa was great . She's very sweet and bright . 
I am impressed , we aren't locals and I really chose the best place on yelp. Yummy yummy . 
I got the waffle and chicken . The chicken was JUICY and moist!!! I was skeptical because I hate dry meat but this was SO PERFECT !!!! 
The pancakes were SO good too"}
{"text":"I'm so sad about this. Was very excited for this restaurant to open as I live a block away and after 3 attempts I'm going to have to give a thumbs down. Food is greasy!!! Very greasy. As in my veggie egg white omelette was greasy? Why? How? Tried to change it up but still had an overall bland oil taste. Restaurant appearance is cute, no wait times (though I understand why) and super cute merchandise though!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place for breakfast and brunch!
Everything was wonderful, food, service, cleanliness and decor!
Little busy but hey it was a Sunday AM in Las Vegas and busy means great place!!
We will be back and glad it's a neighborhood locale not on the strip!"}
{"text":"After hearing from my sister that this place was good we decided to eat here while visiting Las Vegas. So glad we did. The quality and staff were soooo good. The prices were reasonable and felt like one of the highlights of our trip. Will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place it's beyond cute inside, food is yummy portions are big staff is nice... you'll smile as soon as u walk in."}
{"text":"One of the best places I've been to in Nevada. Hands down. I love everything about it, the service is great, the food is amazing. Don't even get me started on the bread! I will definitely recommend this place to all my friends before they go to Vegas."}
{"text":"Very delicious. Breakfast sandwich was huge. I hope to return. Staff shirts were funny."}
{"text":"The food was great and service was the cherry on top. Christina made us feel like we were having breakfast in her home. She went above and beyond."}
{"text":"Without fail when you walk in the door there are smiles all around. Right away an experience begins with all the cute decor on through out the restaurant all the way down to the servers uniforms! PJ's! So very cute!!

Food!! I've had a few different items here but down to it all the crunchy French toast as a platter is the best thing every with banger sausage!! Mmmm!

Not only was the food amazing at each visit. But you can see it all being made in an open view to the kitchen! Nice and fresh no sitting in the window for 10min! From griddle to plate to my table. Yum!

I drive out of the way past eggworks and all that to go here simply for service and over all quality of their food(:

See in about an hour Rise & Shine. 
P.s. Coffee is so yummi and strong definitely my morning pick me up."}
{"text":"This place is so over rated that it's not even funny.. the people rating this are not foodies just locals living in the area with nowhere else to really eat. Vegas has top notch spots in this town and this one doesn't make the cut.. the food isn't that good and the price is way over board for what you get. The employees look like they are shipped over from the hood. Southern highland residents should be embarrassed of this place.. I know I was when the bill came after that long wait to be seated,get served and then to have a meal that I didn't even want because it was shit. I can't believe I payed for it..  but hey don't take my word for it, you go wasted your money."}
{"text":"The first thing you notice about this place is probably the floral umbrellas on the ceiling. It's the first time I've seen a set up like that. It was pretty cool.

You can tell this restaurant is very laid back as the waitresses were all wearing PJs. It kind of threw me off when I first saw it but I suppose it's their uniform and it goes with the breakfast theme.

The service was okay nothing too impressive about it.
The food was okay too.

I got a Belgian waffle and a side of fries. Yeah, very healthy breakfast. The waffle was the only thing on the menu that interest me. It was too soft for my liking. It just felt like I was eating a pancake but in a waffle shape. I did like that they put the butter on the side in a separate container and also asked me before hand if I wanted whipped cream. I order fries because there's this other brunch place my boyfriend and I like to go to and their fries are so amazing that whenever I visit I always eat there. Sadly, the place is on the other side of the town so I decided to curb my carvings by getting fries here. The fries here are very thin and didn't really impress me."}
{"text":"We were staying at the M resort and wanted a local breakfast spot. We yelped and found this place. Chicken and waffles were fantastic, service was impeccable... A great break from the crazy of Las Vegas. It's worth leaving the hotel for this place."}
{"text":"We ordered breakfast for pickup on a Saturday morning. We used the menu available online, called in our order, and were told to pick it up in 20 minutes. When we arrived, the hostess told us a total of over $40! We ordered a bagel sandwich, French toast, and 2 orange juices!!! We were shocked at the price because the menu we ordered from had completely different prices. It stated $2.85 for an orange juice, and we were told they raised the prices and it was now $5 for a small orange juice, the size of a kids cup!! They did NOT update their menu or prices online, did not give us a total over the phone, and really expected us to pay $10 for a few sips of orange juice? The food was decent, but the hashbrowns were mushy and flavorless, instead of crispy and salty. The bagel sandwich was okay, but nothing worth $15!! We will never be back here again. The prices are insane and the food is not worth it."}
{"text":"1st time to eat this place, hubby & I ordered Ultimate Steak & eggs....
Food is- delicious
Place- clean and nice
I can't give 5 star, coz the service is no good..
Don't expect the staff to be all happy, coz no smile ont their place... most especially the person, that stays by the door....
Poor customer service."}
{"text":"Red Velvet Pancakes?! How original, I've never seen those on a menu until I dined at Rise & Shine. Unfortunately due to the 24 hour buffet pass I was only looking for a salad or something green. I'll have to try the red velvet realness on my next visit. I ended up getting a most delicious grilled chicken cobb salad. It was HUGE! It was one of the best cobb salads I've ever had it comes with ranch dressing and I did SOS sauce on side. Usually cobb salad comes with blue cheese which I thought was good until I had R&S grilled chicken cobb. My friend devoured the chicken wrap. He said it was very similar to McDonald's chicken wrap, which is discontinued, but better. Wish I had taken photos but we were all super hungry and had to eat and go quick. 

Rise & Shine is a local breakfast joint where waiters and waitresses get on with their day in PAJAMAS! Wild. It's very family friendly, reasonably priced, and best of all the menu has a little something for everyone. There's a large variety of breakfast items as well as \"afternoon items\" which we had at 11:30am so I guess it's just what they call that section but doesn't mean you have to wait until noon. The interior is big and cool with a fun surprise on the ceiling. Everyone here has a great attitude, very friendly and attentive even when they're busy. You can call ahead of time and check out the wait time, it'll most likely be 5-10 minutes. 

Parking is plentiful, but not really shaded... there are tons of other stores located in this shopping center such as a grocery store and other restaurants. Will definitely be returning next time I'm headed to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I agree with a few of the other posts, it is off putting walking into a restaurant, and no one says hi, or comes up to you for a while. It was good to expect that before I went, because I probably would have cursed and stormed out had I not been expecting it. The first time I went, I got the chilaquiles (not sure if that is spelled right), and I won't be ordering those ever again. They were way to salty for me, but my husband liked his chicken fried steak, and eggs benedict the last couple of times we've went. We'd come back, but it's not my number one breakfast spot in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Wonderful options for the kids and adults. 
Love their omelettes and Nutella coffee drinks."}
{"text":"I have one word, CHRISTINE!   We are tourists and she went way and far beyond the call of duty. She gave us so much attention for eight people at one table. 

She did not do it for personal gain but  because she genuinely cared about us and catered to our every need. My husband and I highly recommend her for promotion in your organization. 

I am a human resources professional of over 40 years and to me she is the epitome   of customer service"}
{"text":"I am so happy I found this breakfast spot. I always get their ultimate steak and eggs. I am really picky about how my steak is cooked. They make it perfect everytime! It's always so juicy and and soft, it just melts in your mouth. The servers are always nice, and they wear these cute pj's. Me and my husband come in often for Sunday brunch, there's always a little wait, as it's always packed. Great place, I recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are here for breakfast before leaving Las Vegas.  It is a nice place, and it is decorated with cute umbrellas hanging upside down from the ceiling.  All of the wait staff are in their pajamas, and everyone was super friendly.  

I was happy that they had enough healthy and vegan items to select from the menu.  I just had the Go Go Greens Juice, a fruit plate, and potato hash.  They were all delicious.  I could have ordered oatmeal but decided to go with the potato hash for my carbs in the morning.

My husband had the eggs and corned beef hash with sourdough toast, and he enjoyed his meal.  I would come back here again if I am in town.  It is in a quiet neighborhood, and it is very close to the 15 S Freeway south of the busy city of Las Vegas.  Lovely place."}
{"text":"Best service and wonderful coffee and well prepared delicious breakfast food. Bigger now with more tables. Love the waiters in pajamas, cute touch"}
{"text":"I went there today with a business partner. I ordered a build your own omelet with 3 choices, bacon, avacodo and cheddar. The omelet came to me without the avacado, scorched egg and tiny tiny bits of bacon- GROSS. My business partner ordered 3 item omelete
Egg white spinach cheese and avacodo, received without the avacodo and spinach . Chef sent it back without the actual order corrected. I do not recommend this restaurant . We should have went to Metro Grill"}
{"text":"I came here this morning with my son to have breakfast because we had time to kill before his haircut appointment across the street. Glad I did. 

Cheyenne was our server and she was so patient with me. I normally don't take my son out to eat without my boyfriend, so I was kind of nervous. But she let me take my time and always checked on us.

I'll def come back :)"}
{"text":"A cute, locally owned brunch and lunch establishment that serves good food. Living in Southern Highlands is great, but I have to admit that the community is detached from many places. The area was in need of a brunch place and I'm glad Rise & Shine filled that void. 

My family was immediately greeted and promptly seated. We got our orders and food quick. Selection and prices were reasonable. I ordered corned beef hash and eggs with a pot of bread. I've never heard of a pot of bread so I ordered it. What came was a dinner and cinnamon roll baked together served in a pot and it was served with jam and butter. Surprisingly good and I wanted more! Service was extremely friendly and attentive. Our waitress was clad in pjs and TOMS. Stylishly comfy and charitable. We left satisfied and will come back.,"}
{"text":"Five stars due to service, presentation, and food quality! 

The place was recommended by my fiance's grandmother, and was his late grandfather's favorite place to eat. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very bright and relaxed. We loved how the servers were all in their PJs! Our waitress Halle was very sweet and energetic, and made our experience that much better.

Their fresh orange juice is definitely recommended, and their \"dinnamon\" rolls (a mix of cinnamon roll and dinner roll) were amazing. I personally got the smoked salmon eggs benedict which came with hashbrowns and was topped with hollandaise and capers, and was very happy with the food. My fiance got the buffalo fried chicken with eggs and hashbrowns, and couldn't finish all the chicken since there was just so much! All in all we both were happy with what we got, and definitely plan to come back next time we're in town.

Hopefully next time I won't accidentally forget my sunglasses!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this breakfast spot! I don't know how they cook their pancakes but they were so delicious and the service was great. It's so cute that the servers wear pajamas and I loved the decor."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I'm so sad it's so far away! You walk in to see the coolest artsy/colorful umbrellas on the ceiling, the waitstaff all wear their \"pajamas\" & you get huge portions..everything we got was delish! I'm craving it now lol. Crispy bacon,good omelet & try their pot of bread! If I'm back in Vegas-I'll def be back-2 thumbs up! I may wear MY pjs next time lol Open one here in San Diego you'd kill it! Heck is even work there"}
{"text":"This was such a pleasant surprise. It was a Sunday and our group included seniors down to an 18 month old. We were greeted with smiles, seated immediately with coffee. 
The breakfast menu was extensive. We placed different orders, we were all please with how delicious everything was. They handled the needs children well.
My husband's waffles were the best he'd  ever eaten and he's tried a lot of them. My red velvet pancakes were excellent and a large portion.

We will return again when we visit vegas, this hidden gem located in a quiet neighborhood off the strip."}
{"text":"Great hospitality.  The wife and I had our 3yr old son with, who has a lot of energy and the waitress was great.  
I had the 3 egg breakfast that I enjoyed. Hash browns a little dry but the eggs and Turkey kielbasa was great. 
Wife had the chicken and waffles that she seemed to enjoy."}
{"text":"Its not often I give 5 stars, but this place definitely deserves it.  Plus, I love breakfast.  If I'm paying for breakfast, it better knock my socks off.  This place does!  

Its located in my neighborhood (Southern Highlands), WHoooo hooo for me.  Sometimes this place gets really busy, so there may be a bit of a wait.  When its nice outside, you can be seated in the outside area.  

Great atmosphere &  friendly staff (dressed in PJ's).  I've been here a couple times and dishes with steak...super awesome.  I have yet to try waffles and pancakes.  But I've just been so successful with their steaks, I just order it every time. 

Recently I realized that they had my ultimate favorite combo.  Ribeye steak & Chillequiles.  Wooo woot!  I like their bread in a pot & fresh squeezed orange juice to compliment my food.  I like to pull out the whole bread and pour the cream cheese frosting all over like a cinnamon roll.  Mmmm Mmmmm

Prices are major for breakfast, but their portions are rather generous.  So, yup, split the plate and bill with your breakfast/brunch date."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast place in Vegas. Great coffee, great eggs, and the steak and eggs are incredible."}
{"text":"Really liked it alot.  Lots of interesting things on the menu.  Steak chilaquiles."}
{"text":"First time I've been disappointed in Rise and Shine.  I usually go with the steak and eggs, with the pot of bread.   Today I went with the corned beef hash and eggs.  It's not even corned beef.  It was bacon hash and not a single piece of corned beef.  It was ok but definitely not what I expected.    Eggs ordered over medium.  Came out over hard. And the toast?   It was ok, but I will never understand sending toast out with hard butter on the side.   We asked for them to soften it, however the toast wasn't hot enough to melt it.  Seriously?   I will stick with Mary's Hash House for my hash.  And no, not the over rated Hash House a Go Go."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Great food and great staff!! The place was very busy but staff still maintained a great attitude!! Will go again and again!! Coffee was great too!!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service. Must have the cup of bread! Ashley S. was attentive even during a busy time."}
{"text":"The hubby and I had a great breakfast here but I would have to agree with Michael U., a most conscientious and loquacious Yelper, that this is probably not the best breakfast in Las Vegas. Still, it's good food and very reasonably priced. And I do think it is cute that the waitresses are all in PJs... it goes with the whimsical décor.

Hubby is a huge steak and egg fan. That is his go-to breakfast order. So, it was fun for him to have some different options. He settled on the spice rubbed rib eye and he said the steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The chilaquiles were not that great, but I do give them props for making their own (some places just use store bought tortilla chips and enchilada sauce, bleh). Since we had about a 30 min wait for a table I had plenty of time to look at the menu and spent most of it deliberating between ordering French Toast or eggs. I am not a huge fan of eggs but we were about to get on the road back to Phoenix and I knew I needed some protein or else I would get hungry on the drive. Fortunately our waitress pointed out that if I ordered the French Toast I could add 2 eggs and a meat (sausage, bacon, or my choice turkey kielbasa) for only $3.50. So, that is what I did. It proved to be too much food for me but all of it was yummy so I didn't mind.

They were very short staffed that day but the service was still friendly and efficient. I would say the food was probably only 3 and a half stars but the cool atmosphere and staff rounded it up."}
{"text":"Our family came here for the first time today and seriously can't see us going anywhere else in the valley for affordable and delicious breakfast/brunch/lunch. The food was flavorful, well-made, and the pot of bread will literally melt in your mouth. We ordered:

Rib Eye Steak and Chilaquiles: I have never had chilaquiles before and I seriously feel like i have been deprived my entire life. My steak was cooked perfectly the way I liked and the tortilla chips that were bathing in refried beans, scallions, and cotija cheese were the perfect accompaniment. 

Chicken and Waffles: savory & sweet at its finest! The chicken was not dry at all, it was not overly battered and the waffles had a slight crunch on the outside but soooo soft and perfect on the inside. The maple syrup that they served with them was warm and had sticks of cinnamon in them! YUM. 

Silver Dollar Pancakes with Strawberries: Our little guy devoured these. He especially loved the sprinkling of powdered sugar over top! I had a bite, and I must say, they are some of the best pancakes I have had. Perfectly light with a little bit of crispness around the edges. 

Our food was absolutely perfect and if they only served these three things, we would STILL come back on a regular basis. Although the food was delicious, our absolute favorite part of this place was our server, RYLEY!!! She has such an amazingly genuine and kind energy about her. She complimented us on our parenting and how well behaved our four year old was. (she is a nanny herself, so knows a thing or two about kiddos) In a world where there is so much negative criticism, she is such a breath of fresh air! Our food came out in a timely manner and i LOVED that she brought out our little guy's food first, which in the parenting world is a God-send. Even our little guy liked her. He drew her little hearts on the comment card that we turned in! We left there feeling so lighthearted and truly lucky to have been helped by such an awesome person. We CANNOT wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"I had the ultimate steak and eggs and it was perfect!  I ordered it medium rare with my eggs over easy, everything came cooked to perfection. Our server was Riley, super nice and attentive!  The atmosphere is awesome as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Voted the best of las vegas 2014!
Friendly staff, excellent service.. and of course.... great food! !!!!"}
{"text":"Great place, fun staff and the food was yummy."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food great service! Love the pot of bread and French press coffee!!"}
{"text":"Love the openness of this place. Their exchange is very high for the price and their coffee (Lavazza) is delicious!!

Service is excellent and the food is a notch above due to the spices they use. At least I think that's why. I'm not a chef."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a customer. And on fathers day my wife gave me a choice and I decided to try something new and I'm glad I tried rise n shine.

I ordered the chicken n waffles and my wife ordered the rib eye steak n eggs. Both were very delicious! The food alone was 5 stars. The service was exceptional. 

I love Roscoe's chicken and waffles in la but we hardly ever go there and I found a chicken n waffles place that rivals Roscoe's!"}
{"text":"We're STILL regulars thanks to Analise. She is amazing! Always very courteous, so accommodating! Also, Desiree is amazing as always."}
{"text":"Just great steak and eggs in a cute lil breakfast joint. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We just moved to southern highlands and decided to give this place a try. The food was excellent, but two out of the three times we were there we had really slow service by the same server. If we return, we will make sure that we don't have her again. It really gives this restaurant a bad name."}
{"text":"The 1 star  for our waitress and our waitress ONLY. She was still training . So we had some compassion for her.

We have come here twice before but the service and food has always been mediocre. Its been about 8 months since our last visit so we decided to give it a go because of location convenience Came in this morning, ordered a kids breakfast and two adult breakfasts. My side dish of eggs and bacon, they eggs were WAY smaller than the kids eggs. Found that odd. They also forgot to put the cheese on them. Mentioned it to our server and she offered to have it fixed and I declined since we were on a time schedule because my husband was having breakfast with us on his work lunch break. I go to pick up a piece of my bacon and there is hair on it.... I also noticed the cook having a long beard and instead of them making him shave it due to health violations and cleanliness and professionalism, they made him wear a net over it ..... really?

Our waitress was very apologetic. They removed the $4.50 side plate. Hair in someone's food is disgusting and should absolutely never ever happen. The fact that the manager sent her back with a $5 coupon and our discount check, and he didn't even have not only the balls or the respect to come over and apologize to us shows their lack of care and customer service. But really, what would he say? There's no excuse for hair in someone's food because the bottom line is that is a result of the not so cleanliness of their kitchen. And as a server myself it's just unacceptable the lack of customer service as well. 1 stars for our server being sweet and professional, I feel bad that her manager had no balls and made her continuously apologize to us. We gave our coupon to the table over. I will also be notifying the health district . As well as never returning

Edit : the beard guard might be up to code with the health policy, but hair in my food is not ."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go out to breakfast this morning, after reviewing several restaurant's in the area on google we choose - Rise and Shine in Southern Highlands. Our server Gelato was absolutely wonderful! She promptly came to our table and took our drink order answered any questions we had and was very attentive filling our coffee and water glasses throughout our meal. We will definitely be back and request to sit in her section! The food was excellent too."}
{"text":"Big parties not welcome. Don't come here if you have a big party where more than person is paying... they don't split checks more than two ways. Per the cashier this is a restaurant policy. They don't warn you verbally, but apparently it's somewhere on the menu. Hope you see this owner and change this unfriendly policy.

Edit: The waitress and the cashier played this fun game of \"maybe the other can do something to split your bill.\""}
{"text":"Sad to write this, came on a Wednesday morning, we were immediately seated, 20 minutes later no one came to our table. After watching three other parties get seated, and attended to, and  have a waitress and busser walk by our table multiple times without service we decided to leave.  We love to support local places, but we will definitely tell our friends and family not to support this place."}
{"text":"I came here today for breakfast ..... Omg!! It was absolutely amazing. It was super busy.... Which has to tell you something!!! I mean this is the spot!!! There was a wait for 25 minutes.... I hate waiting but it was worth every minute that I waited!!!! the entire staff here was great!!! My waitress was the best!! I got the ultimate steak and eggs with a side of red velvet pancakes! I can't tell you because there are no words to describe to you how awesome the steak was.... Then the red velvet pancake ..... That was heaven in my mouth! It was just an overall great experience I was talking to the table right next to me they said that they have had a rise and shine addiction for 2 years now!!!  I totally see why! Great job rise and shine I am your new biggest fan!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best places for steak and eggs. Depending on which server you get, the service is either real good or real slow. However, I did notice that when I went to the bathroom some peoples food was under the heat lamp and then after I came out from the bathroom it was still there waiting for someone to pick it up. I then sat at my table and the food was still under the heat lamp probably a total of 10 minutes which is long in food time to be fresh."}
{"text":"My panini was good... it was nothing special but my boyfriend loved the steak and eggs.  He ordered his steak medium-rare and it came out moo'ing but we were too hungry to send it back, the wait was atrocious.  They say that they are a \"Steak and Egg\" place so if you want variety, you're SOL.  On a good note, I loved the atmosphere, the staff wore pajamas and the decorations were so creative with the umbrellas and all."}
{"text":"Love love this place. The atmosphere, waiter and waitress in PJs! They are friendly.  Service is great. Food is amazing!! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is place is soo good! Best breakfast place in town!  Their bread in a pot is to die for!"}
{"text":"I LOVE breakfast! And Rise & Shine far exceeded my expectations that fellow yelpers have laid out for me. Thank you once again Yelp for showing me a true gem in this hot, chain ridden unforgiving desert. Now on to the details...

At first glance Rise & Shine looks to be a very small nook of a restaurant at the corner of a nice new strip mall in Southern Highlands. And that's pretty much what it is. But don't let looks deceive you! This small nook has so much to offer. 

We were greeted by a tall gentleman in a blue striped shirt who sat us promptly at a booth facing the open kitchen. It almost seemed as if he was welcoming us into his home, so I assumed it was his establishment in some form or another. 

Our server followed to take our drink order, and say hi to the little mama, and we decided on the French Press Illy coffee (do not pass this up!) and some waters. She returned very quickly with our own personal French press, two mugs, a sand timer with three strengths, and some real cream (hallelujah). She explained the timer, took our order of Steak Chilaquiles, a Spinach Swiss Avocado Omelet, and two pots of bread, and whisked away in her cute paisley pjs. 

The coffee was divine after letting steep until just after the yellow timer ran out, then pressing with much anticipation... fresh, aromatic, strong!, and ours to pour as we wished. 

The pots of bread came out first as little mama was hungy, and was getting antsy, and the three of us shared in a blissful pulling and devouring of the light fluffy just barely there cinnamon bread with fresh jam and real butter. I could have eaten five of those pots by myself!

Then came our meals. I wish I could have taken pictures, but they lasted a whole millisecond after our server set them down before we dove in like hungry hyenas. The smell of fresh ingredients was overwhelming, and we were all foaming at the mouth!

Hubby's Steak Chilaquiles were unreal. Fresh tortilla chips smothered in refried beans and a slightly spicy sauce, with cheddar and cotija cheeses, then topped with two over medium eggs and avocado, and a whole dinner sized rib eye steak that was PERFECTLY seasoned, with a side of salsa and sour cream. Heaven! 

My omelet, while simple and unassuming, was perfection. Not too overly huge as some omelets in this town can be, not too overloaded with cheese, or grease from cheap cheese (uck!), but beautifully fluffy and balanced, topped with creamy green avocado. Fabulous! The potatoes were fantastic, and again perfectly seasoned, and didn't even need ketchup or hot sauce (as I usually drench restaurant taters in). 

Each plate was accompanied by a fresh fruit stack of strawberries pineapple and oranges, which little mama enjoyed so much, the tall man in the blue striped shirt came by and offered her more of, which she gleefully took and crammed more in her sweet face. 

All in all, this place was so pleasing, it is now our favorite breakfast joint in town hands down. We will be returning (more than likely next weekend!), often! Hurray YELP!"}
{"text":"Excellent food
Cute atmosphere
Wait staff wore pjs :-)
Laura was our waitress 
Super fast"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places we ate at on our trip to Las Vegas. The food was fresh and recipes well thought out. My family was extremely happy with the fun ambiance and great service from Laura our awesome waitress. Try the cup-o-bread!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Food was great and the service was top notch!  My favorite breakfast place in Vegas."}
{"text":"So I've been. To the location on flamingo and I wasn't happy with the timing of the service and the food was subpar. I figured I would give rise and shine one last chance but noooo.  I got my order to go and purchased a orange juice that they charge $5 and it was half filled in a small cup. Second purchased the pancakes.  Extremely dry . Must say they were huge but barely any syrup to go along with it.. never again"}
{"text":"Such a great place - with such a great menu! Ashley was our waitress and she was fantastic, super friendly! Large portions and the cup of bread was a great treat. Will be coming back for sure!!! Love the coffee options too."}
{"text":"This is our first time here and it was great! Marie was a fantastic server and the food was delicious. I had the salmon eggs Benedict and it was out of this world!"}
{"text":"Came here for bfast based on reviews and was somewhat disappointed by the food. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing - I went with the smoke salmon and eggs Benedict. I'm always a huge fan of eggs Benedict but I wasn't a fan of this dish. The spinach didn't come cooked and that was a bit odd because everything else was hot. My friend ordered the ham and egg Benedict, and he said that his was delicious. He ate everything and the hash brown. He also ordered a side of sausage but was not a fan of that at all. 

The customer service was great! Our waitress was very kind and checked in with us often. 

Cute place but wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"This was highly recommended by some friends. Our expectations were high. Everyone lived up to it! The food was excellent! Service friendly and professional. We were a group of 11. Everyone loves bed their food. I had steak and eggs. The GoGo juice. Steak was ordered MR they nailed it. The hash browns were crispy. Make sure you get the bread in a bowl. Yummy!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place. This is our go to place for breakfast. Best pancakes in town. I would have given this place five stars, but sometimes customer services isn't always the best."}
{"text":"Fantastic family owned restaurant tucked away near the South Point casino. The breakfast was great, but the service was exceptional. Many restaurants in Vegas seem to rely on their name recognition or posh environment. This place though maintains it's charm while delivering a satisfying meal. I got the Chicken & Waffles and it was delicious. The Chicken was crispy but also very tender and juicy on the inside. Couldn't get any better than that. My mom got a panini and she said all the ingredients seemed very fresh. And the waiters/waitresses are constantly moving, working, providing exceptional service. Can't thank then enough for a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!! It's officially our new favorite breakfast spot !!!
All the cute girls that work there run around in pj's !! Not to mention the ribeye steak and eggs were amazing !!"}
{"text":"Fun new breakfast joint ! Great food! So fun how the staff wore pjs too! Great service and amazing food. Would definitely come again for a savory option!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this place!  Walking in we were greeted immediately by very friendly employees. The decor is very cute and it kept my daughter entertained. Food was good and our server was great. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"BS +++

COT DAMN! I finally found  a breakfast spot here in LV that's worth  reviewing.  Coming from NYC breakfast is important.  This place is as good as it gets.  The hostess is super nice and cool.  The waitress is super nice and very attentive.  I ordered the XTRA protein breakfast.  The  cook kills it! Everything about this place is good.  I checked out the restroom and it's clean and  it has a slimming mirror.  Pajamas! They wear pajamas! How chill is that? 

I recommend to visit this place whether you are a local, a tourist, or just hangry like I was.  I saw check out the website before you come  so you can  set your target on your food and order ASAP!  And lastly, there is a big cock by the door and I'm not talking a rude  guy either.  It's so cool!

Food is BOMB
Restrooms are CLEAN
Tables CLEAN
Table wait time NONE
Take out wait time is QUICK
Mood is CHILL AF
Customer service is GREAT (super friendly and huge  smiles)
Ambiance Super hipster like with upside down umbrella
Kitchen SUPER CLEAN

BS = it's just O.K. (experience)
BS+ = Yo! I like this place.
BS++= That's Whoa! This place good.
BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!"}
{"text":"First of all, I think it's important to say I have been a customer here since the restaurant opened. I am glad it is in our neighborhood, and I think it has the potential to be a cornerstone business in our area of Southern Highlands. I typically order breakfast to go for my family...the same things each time, as we aren't to adventurous in the morning. I really enjoy the selection, location, customer service, and portion sizes, but I have had problems with the consistency in the preparation of dishes from day one.

Some times, our meals are spot on, and other times they are a complete miss. It is a mystery ever time I open the containers as to what we will get. Don't get me wrong...if I order biscuits and gravy, that's what will be in the box. I just don't know if I will have three-day-old microwaved biscuits or fresh. Also, tossing 4 slices of banger sausage into gravy does not a sausage gravy make. Southerners beware, this is pretty far from authentic. Chicken fried steak is pretty awesome every time. Good crunch and spice...huge portion!

I will continue to eat here, because let's be honest...my hangover is not going to feed itself."}
{"text":"First time here was a decent experience. Service was great. And food was good. I had the classic steak and eggs. Steak was pretty flavorful. Only complaint is that the steak was overcooked. I ordered medium rare and it came out well done. The rarest part of the steak looked medium well. Although it was over cooked. It was a pretty tender piece of steak. But if the steak is the main part of the meal, the cooks need to be more attentive to that. Selling point is the steak. Not the hash browns, biscuits, eggs, etc.... service wasn't too bad either. Although they could've done a bit more than walk away after I let them know about the steak."}
{"text":"Came here before I went to Daylight :)  
Ordered the bagel & egg sandwich, 3 Little pigs.  Bacon, Ham, and banger with American cheese on an Everything bagel.  Pretty appetizing!  I wish I had asked for a slightly undercooked egg to break the yolk and let it smother my bagel though!  The \"fries\" are like hash, so don't expect the type of fries you get with a burger :)"}
{"text":"Great place for a breakfast or brunch. Their bread is delicious and freshly
baked.

The chicken and waffle is really crispy, soft and spot on. I'd go back here
for a breakfast or brunch anytime!"}
{"text":"Been here twice.  Both times were excellent and we recommend this place to anyone in the south point area."}
{"text":"very good cooked and quality steaks. between the brothers our new go-to for steggs when in Vegas/Henderson, Mariah was very welcoming and attentive. great first impression for a fairly new restaurant of the popular flagship locale."}
{"text":"The restaurant was cute with colorful umbrellas hanging down from the ceiling.  There was a short line upon entering, but it took us an unusually long time to be seated though we could see a few tables that had been prepped and empty. 

We decided to share a full stack of pancakes plus strawberries. The sliced strawberries were served on the side and our 5 medium sized pancakes were nothing to write home about.  Overall we were underwhelmed by this dining experience.  

A rating of 2.5 would be most appropriate."}
{"text":"Super friendly helpful staff!  Immediately seated, quickly offered coffee or other beverage, menu items explained pleasantly, food was very good and just as we ordered. Cute theme has the staff wearing pajamas.  A little pricey but worth coming back again.  Nice to have in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love this place everyone is friendly service was fast and wonderful. Food was delicious, they have a great variety of food as well! Love their fresh squeeze juices and smoothies !!"}
{"text":"Found a new breakfast and lunch spot on Yelp and it delivers in service and flavor! I'm all for pancakes and waffles-the usual, but sometimes I'm craving for a hearty breakfast without all the floury carbs. Rise and Shine centers their breakfast go-to with steak and eggs, but they have all the classics favorites too. Our server, Maria, was a ray of sunshine friendliness. Even the host, was cheerful when seating us.
 I ordered a coffee with cream and it was smooth and strong. I had to order their popular rib eye with eggs and potato hash. Just a note, Maria did let me know the hash brown has green onions in it, but you can request your hash plain if you like. I don't mind green onions in general, but next time I think I will have my hash plain, but if you do want it more savory, go with the green onions. The rib eye steak was tender and well seasoned with pepper and not too much salt. The poached eggs were perfectly runny inside and flavorful. The Build Your Own Burger was definitely home made and was delicious. It wasn't densely packed together like frozen patties and tasted fresh. They also serve alcohol here if you want to get your brunch on with something bubbly. I also was wowed by the bread in a cup. It's like the center of a cinnamon roll in a little cup with a cream cheese frosting dipping sauce. It was steaming when I tore into it. Sometimes a little flour carb is ok and when it's this good, it's a must try.

All in all, this place is a hit for me. The service is excellent and the food can back it up. The place is very clean and I think it has enough charm to be a local favorite. Definitely will be back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"First time here everything was delicious. My 10 year ate a big burrito filled with steak and chorizo. The service was also great!"}
{"text":"Always solid. Big portions. Best restaurant in SoHi. On weekends the wait can be excessive."}
{"text":"Fun restaurant with waitresses dressed in pjs. They have a great smoothie and coffee bar. My eggs Benedict and kids' pancakes were slightly over cooked, but the ambiance and experience were great. Thank you."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Visiting from ca and found this place on Yelp.  Excellent food, service and friendly atmosphere.
Will definitely come back next time we visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is so cute. The staff wears pajamas and the whole inside is decorated adorably. The food is pretty good and customer service is amazing ! I have been here about 4 times now, and am excited for them to open up their new location. I will definitely be returning to this place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I never give 5 stars but this place is close to getting a 5 start rating soon. I have been here twice and both times the food was FANTASTIC!!

Busy!! Be prepared to stand in line. Food is worth it! 

Food: everything that I have ordered has been perfact!! Hot, fresh, better then expected. Cinnamon French toast highly recommend. Freash cornbeef in the cornbeef hash, eggs made as asked, sour dough bread toast was good, jellies was average, butter was great, diet soda a smidge flat, grilled steak & chorizo burrito was fantastic!! 

Service: is ok, servers are super friendly,  but difficult to get your water topped off or keep your beverage cup full, They were pajamas *smile*,  fast service (not including drinks service), they give great recommendations. They are always busy helping people people or cleaning something.

Parking: lots
Dinning area: inside-large, ok clean, they wipe each utensil after it's washed and dried, they clean all condiment at the end of day, a little loud, lots of talking, if you are trying do romantic, maybe sit outside (but can be windy at times). Cute flower umbrellas hanging from ceiling (some are twirling)
Outside: lots of umbrella tables, big open spaces, very clean. Outside is nice.

Highly recommended for food!! If you are a princess the service here is not for you *smile* but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend and I'm glad he did. This place is about 8 miles from the strip but we'll worth getting out of the hustle and bustle of the Vegas Strip. Once there you're greeted by servers in PJs. The stay open only until 3 so go early. I had the chilaquiles and rib eye. Amazingly good and affordable."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here this morning. It was difficult to choose from their large menu. I had an omelette with a side of corned beef hash and my wife had the Benedict. The food was amazing. Best hash I've ever had. Add the table side French press coffee and the kids pancakes and waffle and we have a new favorite breakfast spot in Vegas must check it out."}
{"text":"Nice staff. very vibrant decor to the place. My steak was cooked a good mid rare, hash brown were mighty tasty, biscuit was delectable . Good quality in steak, but I wished with was more seasoned."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. Wanted to get some breakfast on our way out of Vegas. Service was outstanding. The waitress was very sweet and always attentive. 
Food was good. I think it's a bit better then other places you'll find in Vegas. Definitely get the steak and eggs if you are really hungry. 
Pictures attached"}
{"text":"Not sure if I already reviewed this place already not, but I stumbled across this location because my navigation system gave me the wrong directions to go pick up a friend early in the morning... And I thought it was funny how the everyone who works at this location wears pajamas and I think it's adorable! Our food came out quick and our server had so much personality... Needless to say it was a great experience as a whole. The food was mouth-watering and I'm definitely coming back next time I get the chance, and the money for it. The menu is great with SO much to choose from. I highly recommend this joint if you want to start your day out with something awesome!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good however service is very slow. I know they just opened but wait time for a table is long and even longer for food to come out.  The first time we went our server kept disappearing and never came to check back on us. Had to ask for water multiple times.  Second time they dropped off an iced coffee in a tall glass with no straws. I had to flag down another server to get one.  The food took over 45 mins to come out and bc of that the manager (I think he was the manager) came and apologized and said he would take off our beverages for us.  We got the check and the drinks were still on there. By now we just wanted to leave so we didn't say anything and went up to the cashier. Our bill was $51ish and she said our total was $70ish.  We asked to check and told her there are some mimosas on there that wasn't ours.  She insisted it was our tab.  The manager came by and we had to tell him and he said sorry and took off the alcohol but still didn't take off our coffee he promised.  Again, beyond annoyed at this point and now running late to our soccer game bc we didn't realize breakfast for a party of 3 (2 adults and 1 child) would take 2 hours.  Like I said, both times we came to this location the food was great but service is not up to par.  Unfortunately we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Best Breakfest Joint in Southern Nevada! 

The Breakfest Checklist:

Corned Beef and Hash: Check! Homemade and you can  tell! There are nice big pieces of meat and potatoes and a great helping on your plate!

Baccon: Check! Crispy and never overdone! 

Pancakes and Waffles: Check! Big and Fluffy served with warm maple surup!

Pot of Bread: Never in my life have I seen this! absolutely delish! It is a must get when you go here, and it usually comes with your meal! 

The atmosphere in a nutshell: Breakfest in Bed! The waitresses wear pj's and are so friendly! The ceiling is decorated with sunflower umbrellas, tres chic! 

There are day's when it's super busy, and there are days when you're the only table in the restaurant! But that would be the norm with all restaurants. I'm just saying don't get upset when it's jammed pack on a sunday... because it almost always is!"}
{"text":"Came here for some brunch. There was a short wait and the service was friendly. The waitress told us our food was delayed because there were large parties before us. It took a while for the food to come out but they kept filling our coffee while we waited which was nice. I enjoyed the avocado Benedict and my boyfriend enjoyed the rise and shine burrito. The decorations were also very cute and unique. A good brunch place."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The coffee was excellent and offered frequently. The meals came quickly and were made to order. Very yummy! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"OH LORD!!!! THIS IS THE BOMB PLACE EVER!! I was walkin with my friends to find somethin good and we ended up Rise & Shine! but it was around 2ish almost 3 but the waitress they are so nice to us, no pressure to eat we are chillin and she was so friendly to us! not just service otherwise the food! YUM same price as Ihop, Denny's but the taste and the size are way more taster way more bigger! Definitely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and we are regular customers here (who isn't) 
Do not plan to bring parties larger than 4 or else expect to wait longer than one hour. The restaurant had poor table management. The employees know people are waiting but don't show sense of urgency to get the tables moving. It seems that they are expanding as well, but a better table management system would be beneficial for this business. Using a marker and paper to manage tables is not effective. It's 2015! There is still no adaptation of Apple Pay acceptance."}
{"text":"Amazing! First time there today and I will definitely be coming back. It's delicious, and yummy. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Avocado Benedict with crispy muffin probably the best I've had. Fresh OJ and decent coffee however they don't have any milk alternative, no almond milk coconut or even soy. Pancakes were pretty good not great. Pretty busy but the waiter kept his cool was friendly and considerate . The layout of the restaurant wasn't well planned and they sat a family with two newborns in two carriers on the end where the waiters all entered their orders in an iPad on the wall so it was impossible for guests or staff to get through lol. The line to check out starts getting in the way of those waiting for a table and the staff and guests sitting  The cashier was barely alive lol and the host was frazzled. Hectic though so I feel bad for them. They should model after the busiest breakfast restaurant The Egg & I to better systemize everything."}
{"text":"Cali our server was great. Very delightful. However, Amy set the tone for my wife and I in a very unprofessional way. My wife and I were bothered to the point to where we couldn't even enjoy ourselves. Also, the food wasn't very good for the bill. $41.23 for pancakes I could of made myself and dried steak and eggs. Here's a picture. We won't be returning. The sad thing is , we were genuinely excited to try them. Oh well."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Delicious food and great service. Love the décor inside. The service was perfect. Will definitely return here in the future. A+"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Just what we wanted, maybe better! We hate hate hate when food is greasy and tasteless but it seems that's all you get at most places.... Not this place! No greasy food! All flavor and no grease! Seriously I even looked at my hash browns which would be forgivable should there be some grease. To my surprise their wasn't even residue on the plate! In fact they were so good I ate 80%of them without ketchup and then when I finally reached for ketchup out of habit I realized I had somewhat ruined them by putting such an inferior topping on my hash browns. They even had chipotle chulula.... OMG seriously everything was amazing. Wish there was one in so cal.... Say close to Murrieta;);)"}
{"text":"We drive down here from the strip just to eat breakfast here.  Pretty good ham and eggs with has Browns toast and coffee. Our bellies are full. Cool atmosphere.  We will be back on our next trip to Las Vegas for sure!!"}
{"text":"This place is a must when visiting Vegas! It is a bit of a drive away from the strip but I heard there is a closer location near the strip! Just the ambiance of this restaurant is awesome! I love the interior, the cute flowers in the ceiling and the servers wearing pajamas. It really does give it a unique vibe! 

Food was DELICIOUS and  really big portions! Our family ordered the chicken and waffles, pancakes, country fried steak, steak and eggs and honestly, you cannot go wrong with any order! 

Oh and you cannot leave without trying the bread pot! It certainly is a MUST! 

I can't wait to go back to this restaurant! Great service and awesome staff! :)"}
{"text":"This place inspired me to coin a new phrase : BESTFAST!

Worth any drive within 30 miles. Fried chicken and waffles rival the best I've had but are just one of a menu full of great choices. GO HERE only if you want the best breakfast in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, the first time it was amazing, my husband ordered the New York steak, spinach & benedict bagel and I had the country fried steak and eggs. The pot of bread was delicious! Service was great and didn't disapoint. 
The second time was a different story, it was a beautiful morning so my husband and I decided to eat outside. Bad choice, it took the waitress at least 15 minutes to come and get our drink order, which by that time we already knew what we wanted to eat so we were ready to place our order, however she wasn't ready to take it. ummm...ok.... She came back with our drinks and then took our order. They were out of the pot of bread which was really dissapointing as that was one of the reasons why I wanted to go back there, my husband ordered the spiced rubbed rib eye steak chilaquiles and I had the ham and eggs benedict. His order was ok, the steak was great however my eggs benedict was utterly dissapointing! One egg was poached perfectly and the other was basically a fried hard boiled egg! I have NEVER seen that before. The waitress was nice enough to take it back and bring me a brand new dish. By then it was a little too late. It wasn't just our table that had issues but other tables as well. We even witnessed one of the hostesses ask another customer who had been waiting for a table for 45 minutes if they would like to continue waiting or if they would like to leave. Why would a hostess even ask that? If they were still waiting wouldn't that mean they want to stay? 
Most of the staff were wearing shirts asking customers to write a review on yelp, my husband and I were thinking that they should take those shirts off. They were not having a great day!

I may give them another try only for thier pot of bread....."}
{"text":"The food was so fresh and delicious! The freshly squeezed juice was the best! I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the service is good. I would recommend this place to anybody looking for a good breakfast joint."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfasts. Expect a wait (20-30 minutes) on the weekend as there are only about 25 tables. 

Best breakfast food in Southern Highlands. I especially like the omelets, and banger sausage. Lots of my friends like the pot of bread, but I'm not a big fan. I'd rather they go all the way and make it a cinnamon roll. 

Coffee is excellent, they have French press along with drip. I prefer the press, but typical come with my 3 year old so I don't like the large pot of hot liquid. 

Rise and Shine also has out door seating. It's on the west side of the building so early it gets shade. Nice in the summer. Also good for the morning health nuts who finish bicycle rides or runs here."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times in the last year.  All times it always seems that the waitress I get has the, \"hurry up and take your order and I hate my job attitude and never smiles.\"  Food is great, steak and eggs and pot of gold are my fav.  Eggs benedict are delish too.  

Definitely enough food to fill you up for lunch too."}
{"text":"I pride myself on how great my own steaks are. It's hard for me to find anywhere that is equivalent to mine. This is the best steak I've had at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Very mediocre. The prices are high and the food is just...meh. The service was terrible, our server never refilled our drinks and didn't follow up. Next time I would rather go to McDonalds. At least they have portions that match the price."}
{"text":"A solid, good place to have breakfast if you're in the area. I had the philly steak and egg breakfast while my mom had the chicken and waffles along with the coffee. She loved the coffee too. The food was delicious and not too salty like other breakfast places, and the all meat was tender. Maria, our waitress, was attentive and professional."}
{"text":"Great place for traditional breakfast before hitting the road from Las Vegas! Yummy food fast and friendly service. Waitress in Pj's, cute flowery ceilings and broken plates designed walls, superb place!"}
{"text":"Loved it! We first went to the one off of the 215 and Flamingo but left when they said the wait was an hour.  We were hungry..so we left went to the Southern Highlands location.  Its much smaller and a lot less crowded. 
They gave us a cute cinnamon bun baked in a little tea cup..it came out hard and cold so we asked for a new and the server was very nice about it...gave a fresh one...delicious.
Everything was really good. Corned beef hash GOOD..Steak and Eggs GOOD...Eggs and Bacon (a ton.of bacon)...Great... Chicken and Waffles..Good.  
This place BEATS Eggworks anyday!"}
{"text":"Generous prorations, great atmosphere and kid friendly. The plates where huge and delicious, recommend the cinnamon French toast or the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a breakfast place close to our house one Sunday morning. I suggested Rise and Shine after reading other Yelp reviews. Boy am I glad we did! We have been there a few times and we haven't been disappointed! My favorite so far is the Chicken and Waffles. The fried chicken is AMAZING!!! The batter is super crunchy and the chicken breast is super juicy and tender. I highly recommend coming here for breakfast on the weekends."}
{"text":"Well what can I say I went to rise and shine this morning for breakfast maybe five people in the entire restaurant ordered the chicken fried steak eggs scrambled after waiting 20 minutes my order came eggs Over easy and running yolks everywhere and that grosses me out. Told the girl take it back I don't have time to remake it went to the cashier to pay for my coffee that should be free since they screwed up my order and the kid charges me nine dollars I was like nine dollars for a cup of coffee when I should be free he says oh I thought you ate the bacon seriously dude. Avoid this dump of the restaurant"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on the way home. Ordered the eggs benedict and a cup of Italian roast coffee. The food was good but I especially liked the coffee. Next time, I'll be ordering steak n eggs instead!"}
{"text":"Very expensive and will not diverge from the menu at all. My sister doesn't eat meat and just wanted an egg and cheese sandwich on a bagel, they only make one with ham, sausage and bacon and wouldn't leave out the meats for her. Bizarre..."}
{"text":"Excellent and worth the drive to southern highlands. Comfy atmosphere, friendly staff, and love the PJs the servers get to wear."}
{"text":"I come here every year for my birthday. You can't go wrong with the breakfast menu. The only downside about this place is that it's far from my house."}
{"text":"So far, this is the best restaurant we have found for breakfast. The service is excellent and the restaurant is very clean. We have been there many times in the past few months"}
{"text":"Took the family here on a recent trip to Vegas and desperately wanted to get out of the downtown areas scene of food. Looked this place up on Yelp for favorite bfast spots and saw all the great reviews. All I can say is I am glad we stopped in. This place is tucked into a strip mall which I could care less about. The scenery inside is very eclectic and relaxing. I was more excited about the food!My only suggestion is if you come on a Sunday is come early...we had to wait about 30 mins for a table which was ok because we were not in a hurry. Once seated we ere greeted by a very friendly waitress who suggested a hot pot of french press coffee for the table which was delicious! The menu is packed full of great selections, but they specialize in steak so I decided to get the steak house omelet. It was pretty good, but not the best steak I have had so not judging it off the Ruth's Chris steak quality. My daughter ordered this 2 fisted bagel sandwich filled full of eggs, bacon, ham and homemade sausage and it was killer! I was overall very impressed by this restaurant and most importantly the exceptional service. All the waitresses wear pajamas which my daughters thought were fun. I will definitely be back to this place when in Vegas time permitting...."}
{"text":"The place is yummy! Only bad thing is that it was so cold it made our food cold instantly. Try the watermelon and strawberry juice. :)"}
{"text":"Good food and service. Portions are huge. I have a SUGGESTION.  Put a half omelet with half the potatoes and single slice of toast on the senior menu.  Charge $7.99 for it. I would come in a LOT more often.  Way too much food for us older folks eating alone."}
{"text":"The food was good but not the server! Yes she refilled our coffee, My husband and I were waiting if she will give us a glass of water! She didn't even bother to asked us! Poor service!"}
{"text":"I've seen this place, but just never had the time to try it out until today. I strongly regret not coming here earlier. I ordered the fried chicken and biscuits and it was amazing. The breading on the chicken was amazing and seasoned perfectly. Our server Maria helped make it a positive experience. I highly recommend coming and checking this place out."}
{"text":"Really great place! The staff is pretty cool, very genuine, fast and efficient. A new fav among so many great breakfast joints around here."}
{"text":"Looking for an unstuffy, fairly priced, delicious brunch off the strip on our way back to L.A. and found this kooky gem.  

Decor is weird.  

Sunflower umbrellas hang upside down, mosaic tiles of birds and stuff, generic diner style upholstered booths.  Waitresses in pajamas.  Weird, weird, weird but there's a line out the door at 11:30 a.m. on a Sunday, so I'm in.  

We put our name on the list and proceed to wait.  

There's chaos everywhere.  

A waitress shouts, \"Son of a bitch\" from the beverage station, and then looks up, realizing everyone is staring at her, and then it's back to business as usual.  One patron complains to the girl at the register and there seems to be a lot of high tension.  

We opt for two seats at the counter and I can't help but think of Anthony Bourdain and Kitchen Confidential as I watch these swarthy, kitchen pirates, working as fast as they can with large, sizzling grills full of pancakes, a mountain of hash browns, seared steaks and a deep fryer.  The smells are intoxicating.  

We start with \"Pot of Bread.\"  This is a soft, warm, cinnamon roll baked in a demitasse cup.  Delicious!

On to the main event...it took 40 minutes to get our food and we drooled anxiously as we watched every plate come up.  I had the biscuits and gravy.  Eggs were cooked perfectly and served over an obscene pile of some of the best, chopped, hash browns I've ever eaten.  Gravy was salty and chunky and homemade.  Biscuits were soft and dense, just perfect.  

Husband had the basic bacon and eggs and the generous portion of bacon was so fresh, tasty and perfectly cooked.  

Then came the pancakes. Oh my goodnight nurse, this was pancake heaven!  

We were just talking about some disappointing pancakes we ate at the Aria cafe the morning before.  I mean, they were fine. They were warm and sweet and sort of fluffy.  But what was missing was that extra depth of flavor and a crisp exterior.  

These pancakes at Rise and Shine are almost like a donut, with a thin, crisp crunch on a perfectly golden cake.  The flavor has texture and depth from buttermilk and the syrup has a cinnamon stick in it, which just adds another nice layer of taste.  We could not get through half of our entrees but we for sure took it all home in boxes to enjoy the next day.  

Next time you're heading out of Vegas, try this place. You will not be sorry!"}
{"text":"Maria was our server and did an excellent job on filling our drinks. She recommended the steak and eggs ( which we had heard about from yelp). My husband had it medium rare and it came out perfect. The steak was very flavorful. I had the smoked salmon eggs benedict which was very good with plenty of salmon. We will be back."}
{"text":"They really need to step their game up in the server department. The girl who was eventually my server was kind and had great energy do not get me wrong. Others seemed less thrilled to be there, mentioning to the host that there are other open sections in front of guests creates tension, and when waiting for a long time to be greeted, this really doesn't help. I am thankful the busser grabbed our orange juices, but it was disheartening to see so many walk by and see us still sitting without drinks without checking up on us. I eventually grabbed the busser and asked for drinks. I know we can get tunnel vision in this industry, especially toward the end of the day, but servers are what make or break repeat customers. I really hope that next time this will not be a problem. It really should not take ten minutes to be greeted."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we won't be returning until their health grade improves from a C, if at all. We love this place but their cleanliness and food handling demerits are a deal breaker."}
{"text":"I normally don't eat breakfast and have never really cared for breakfast spots... But now I know it's because I haven't had good breakfast until now! I am so impressed with this place for not being afraid to actually season their food! Each bite was bursting with flavor! And not super greasy like a lot of breakfast places tend to be . The ribeye steak is as good as it looks in the pictures! Biscuits were good but the gravy is some of the best gravy I have ever had! And those hashbrowns, so flavorful! The Ambiance is casual but inviting with lots of natural light with lots of windows. I am so excited to go back and try more things on the menu! Thanks for making me a fan of breakfast!  Luckily I live just a few minutes away so I plan on coming often"}
{"text":"Was visiting Vegas this weekend from LA. On the way home we decided to stop by and try this place out. The inside of the store is so unique. They have different flower umbrellas hanging across the ceiling. Also all the waiters are wearing pajamas haha. 

Our waiter, Vanessa (purple hair), was amazing. She was energetic and so helpful. We were unable to get our cup of bread because of complications but she made up for it by offering something else and taking some things off of our bill. That to me is the definition of customer service. 

The food was delicious. I ordered the steak and eggs and that steak was magical. So tender and juicy. I haven't had a good steak like that in a while. I also ordered the caramel iced coffee, that was amazing as well. 

All in all this place is definitely a 5 star. If you have the time to wait about 30 mins for a table then this is the place to dine at. Next time I am in Vegas I will definitely make a stop here."}
{"text":"I would have given this place a 4 1/2 star if possible, but gave it the bump to 5 stars based on location. The menu had enough options, but was not overwhelming like some breakfast places. I went with a basic 2 egg meal and was not disappointed. The sausage was great quality, eggs cooked perfect, and hash browns very tasty. The bread bowl was a nice touch and service excellent. I will be returning to this location frequently..."}
{"text":"Food was great, for the price it should be. The place is waaaay to busy for me, as I'm a night owl normally. There were at least 20 or more people waiting to be seated while I waited for my to go order. With at least 5-6 tables & a small breakfast bar to sit at open & cleaned. All of the waitresses were dressed in pajamas, & stayed attentive to their tables. Everyone was very polite including the waiting customers. Who all seemed to be accustomed to waiting 20-30 minutes for a table for breakfast. I ordered 2 custom omelets with a side of pancakes & turkey sausage. The turkey sausage was forgotten. But they were way to busy to go back or call. As the phone was ringing off the hook while I was waiting & the line stayed busy when I called from home. 
If you don't mind the wait it's a great breakfast place. If you want a little peace I suggest Denny's."}
{"text":"We typically don't like to go off of our beaten path for our food. But husband had an insane craving for steak and eggs. He googled, \"Best steak and eggs in Henderson\" and he came across Rise and Shine. Let's just say HOT DAMN! The ribeye and eggs were delectable. The ribeye is rubbed in coffee grounds and it was sooo juicy and flavorful. I had the Lox and Cream cheese omelet. I never thought I would enjoy capers in my eggs but wow! This location is the first that serves alcohol and I had the pleasure of trying their sake Bloody Mary. It was light and full of flavor. 
Our server, Dane, was informative and super friendly. He kept up on all of our needs and made us feel comfortable. 
We will definitely be coming back. Maybe even tomorrow. :)"}
{"text":"All I got to say is the red velvet pancakes are the best pancakes I ever had. Heavenly is the one word i would use to describe them. I rarely write reviews and just wanted share."}
{"text":"Another good Yelp find! Lox and cream cheese omelette was fantastic. Coffee rubbed rib-eye & chiliquilles were so good they brought us back 2 days later. Ham steak was less salty and more smoky which was a great surprise and one of the best breakfast hams I've ever had. Fresh squeezed juice were so refreshing. Nice vibe to the restaurant with the wait staff in pajamas."}
{"text":"My most favorite place for brunch.   Great & quick service.   Great food that is original.  Great prices.   What more could you ask for?  

I prefer this place over Cracked Egg.

This place gets packed with a wait line of 20 to 25 minutes but soo worth it.  

This is our spot for brunch and I love that it is soo close to my house.  

Keep up the great everything!"}
{"text":"I was a little intrigued when I saw the sign go up on the old Annie's Italian space down the street from the house. OK, I love breakfast,  will have to try it. I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to chicken/country fried steak and will judge a restaurant based solely on their execution of my favorite dish. I figure that a place with steak in their name had better nail it so I order it and anxiously await. Service time was a bit slow but I'll give it a pass as place was pretty swamped. Plate arrived and presentation was nice with country gravy on the side. I was very pleased with my choice, perfectly cooked with a nice batter and high quality piece of steak. Nothing worse than paying top dollar for some frozen disc of questionable meat from a bulk pack bought at Costco. Wife enjoyed her avocado veggie whatever.. Will be back to try the corned beef hash."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Steak an Eggs were the best we ever had.  Our  picky 9 year old son ate his whole plate and half of mine."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast place! I've been here several times, and the food is consistently amazing. The biscuits and sausage gravy is excellent; finally, a place that serves country gravy properly! The hash browns are slightly spicy and super savory. There is a side of \"pot of bread\", which is a miniature cinnamon roll-like piece of amazingness served in a tiny mug with whipped butter on the side. Their pancakes are perfectly fluffy, and the syrup their place on the table has cinnamon barks floating inside. The steak eggs benedict is a feast for at least two people, and well worth the wait; the hollandaise sauce is creamy and rich, and the steak is tender and juicy. The atmosphere is also lovely. Flowery umbrellas are hung upside down, spinning above you as you dine. All is the servers are in pajamas, aiding to the comfortable, easy-going ambiance. You *need* to eat here!"}
{"text":"Friendly and courteous staff. Nice simple atmosphere. Good table spacing. Coffee was excellent, the kind you don't need to sweeten. I ordered The Ultimate Ribeye and Eggs. Did not disappoint, although steak was a little overdone. Hash was nice snd crunchy. My wife had the Country Fried Steak, awesome breading, light and crunchy, with good gravy. Good place to start a busy Saturday."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place since I saw it in the Review of the Day.  My wife and I decided to head over this past Saturday and we were not disappointed.  The Pot of Bread was delicious along with the jam and butter.  I ordered Chicken Fried Steak and my wife ordered Eggs Benedict.  The Chicken Fried Steak was big and very fried but as I told my wife, you gotta know what you're getting into when you order something called 'Chicken Fried'.  It was very good and for once my over-easy eggs were actually over-easy at a restaurant and not over-runny-raw-and-gross!  I have never been a fan of Eggs Benedict but I did my usual 'cleaning of my wife's plate' after she couldn't eat anymore.  Wow, was it good!  There was tons of ham and it was sliced perfectly!  The Hollandaise (which is the reason I don't like Eggs Benedict) was actually very good and I would even considering ordering it if I went here again.  Service was great!  Very friendly waitress/staff who seemed happy to be working.  Even though this place is a ways from our house I can say with confidence that we will go back for more!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place! Not because it's close by but the service has always been wonderful and the servers very friendly. My daughters order was messed up one time and they immediately apologized and provided a corrected order promptly. Mistakes happen - but they will not argue with you and instead aim to get it right. Kudos!"}
{"text":"YES THE SERVERS WEAR PAJAMAS! Next time I may too! 

Great spot for breakfast. Usually a wait but worth it. Service great. Food good. Had the steak and eggs (what else in a place called \"a steak & egg place?). 

Wasn't planning on getting the best steak in the world. I knew I wasn't at Wolfgang Pucks, Chop, nor was I paying $75 either!

The steak, which the menu said was ribeye, was decent, thin but decent. Diner level. And this place feels like should be in a small diner but it's a large area in a typical strip mall. 

Food was good and the service was friendly and efficient. I left happy."}
{"text":"We arrived at Rise and Shine around 10:00 on Sunday morning.  It was already full.  I'm glad we arrived when we did, because within 5 minutes (no exaggeration) there was a 25-30 minute wait.  And, people stayed.  So, given that the regulars were willing to wait a half hour, I figured we were going to enjoy a solid breakfast.

I had the chicken fried steak and eggs.  I chose the pot of bread, which was brought out early as an appetizer of sorts.  It was warm, and the butter served alongside was room temperature, so spreading was easy.  l liked the cinnamon flavor in the bread, but I think I would have preferred some toast or a biscuit with my meal rather than this bread prior.  The steak itself is a good size, and thick for a chicken fried steak.  This was an issue, as some of the areas were not as tender as I prefer.  I think the meat needed more tenderizing prior to preparation.  Also, it did not appear to be seasoned.  If the meat had seasoning prior to breading, even just some salt and pepper, it would really elevate this dish.  That being said, it was very good, particularly with the tasty sausage gravy.  

The accompanying scrambled eggs were very fluffy.  They were fluffy to the point that they stand out among just about every other place I've ordered eggs in this town.  You get a substantial order of potatoes, which were above average.  I ordered them well done, and was glad I did.  My wife's order had barely any color on them, and I prefer them crunchy.

Servers wear pajamas and were very friendly, which was great.  My tea glass got close to empty once, but she was right there with a refill.  Excellent service overall.  Will we return?  It's not likely given the distance from our house.  But, if I was in the area again I absolutely would eat here and recommend you do the same."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is outstanding and beyond flavorful! They have a wide variety on their menu to even include fresh made smoothies. No matter what you're craving I guarantee this place will have it. It's a weekly visit each day my husband and I have off together."}
{"text":"Another great meal! Never disappoints! Was craving some Biscuits and gravy and it totally hit the spot! Cooks behind the glass were nice to talk to especially since I was dining solo. Cannot wait for their second location to open so I don't have to drive quite so far!"}
{"text":"Rise & Shine has become our go-to breakfast/brunch spot for birthday celebrations.  The Husband celebrated his birthday last weekend and they brought out a chocolatey fudgey pancake topped with whipped cream and sprinkles and of course, a candle.  The Little Gal ended up eating just about the whole thing, which we were super pleased about.  And the Little Guy proclaimed we should celebrate all birthdays here! (This was actually the third time we've eaten here, but the second time we celebrated a birthday.)

On my last two visits, I ordered the Homemade Corned Beef Hash & Eggs.  It comes with three eggs your way and a pot of bread, toast or biscuit.  Their corned beef hash has quite a bit of potato in it, and it's pretty yummy.  I'm glad I ordered it again and ate it all up. I chose the pot of bread this time and it reminded me of a cinnamon roll with the frosting dip on the side.

The Husband ordered the Lox & Cream Cheese Omelette.  He was a bit surprised to see the lox just sitting on the top of the omelette when he expected it to be folded in somehow.  He liked the dijon-cream cheese that was on there and needed to request more though.

Service was good the last two times we went, especially when we had Christine.  I just remember her being an awesome waitress who was super attentive, personable and energetic.  She was also quite efficient too!   

I will admit that our very first visit was years and years ago.  I don't remember how the service was then, but did remember (I started a review a long time ago.) what we ate then. We ordered the New York Steak, Spinach & Benedict-Bagel, Spice Rubbed Rib Eye Steak Chilaquiles, and Southern Style Chicken Fried Steak. The eggs were more medium when we ordered them over easy.  The steak wasn't very flavorful despite it being spice rubbed.  I realized I was looking for some kind of sauce to dip the steak in.  The chicken fried steak was also huge.  The pot of bread was good then, but a bit under baked since it was still doughy.

Our last two visits this year was a better experience than our very first time.  It wasn't necessarily bad then, it was just okay.  They are obviously doing well since it's busy and they have a second location.  There's usually a wait on the weekends, but we arrive later than most so it's not too long.  The decor is adorable inside.  I do tend to notice there are quite a few tables that need to be cleared and I think if they were cleaned up more efficiently, the wait could even be less."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It feels cozy right when you walk in and all the servers are in their PJ's which is so unique. My husband and I ordered the steak and eggs and no joke, it was the best steak and eggs either of us had ever had! The steak was cooked to perfection and seasoned so nicely. If you're looking for a great restaurant, check this place out, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"NOTE: This is a long review but they deserve all the attention. BELIEVE ME. If you are in Vegas, it is worth the drive off the strip to eat here. You will probably be stuck in line at those buffets anyways so use that time to drive here. 

First of all I want to thank, April, our waitress. She was great! Also, I wanted to thank Yelp for helping me find this place. It is a hidden Gem outside the Vegas Strip. This place IS the BEST breakfast place in Vegas. 

Customer Service: 5 stars - everyone is super friendly with big smiles. The manager does come around and sees how everyone is doing.

Atmosphere/decor: cute and very clean. Also in the back of everyone's T-shirts except the waitresses, its say, \"help us by Yelping us\" or something like that. I thought that was really cute and they found out I was a Yelp Elite. LOL

Food: 1000 STARS!! 

I really love this place. We called ahead to see if they take reservations but they don't. But I understood when I got there. Luckily when we went on Sunday morning, it wasn't packed and we got seated right away. The prices is decent for what you get. It was $50 for a group of 4. If you went to IHOP you would have paid MORE and got crappy food. I saw some reviews saying how it is a bit expensive, when you think about it, Denny's and IHOP is about the same if not more. For steak at those places it would be MINIMUM $20 per place. Here - LESS then $15! that is a STEAL! 

Okay, since I got all that out of my way, here is what we ordered:

-Chicken and Waffles with Pot of Bread - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A?select=4aw7W0owSbC7V9Zxa8T96w
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A?select=AR6qplqPO_OJC4aye5xbTQ
The Pot of Bread was AMAZING! MUST ORDER!! Honestly, it was the best bread I ever had. It came out piping hot and just perfect. It wasn't too sweet but wasn't plain. The bread was very fresh and soft. 
The chicken and Waffles was very yummy! The portion was REALLY big and enough to share. I was very impressed with the chicken. It wasn't dry at all and was perfectly crispy. It had a small kick of spice in it and it was perfect. The Waffles was nice and fluffy. I am not a Waffle fan but I LOVED IT! honestly fell in love with this place. 
-The ULTIMATE Steak and Egg Breakfast: the steak came out perfectly well seasoned and very tender. I loved it. It was just delicious. The Hash browns potatoes that came with it was a bit soggy. We thought it would come out more crispy then soft.
-New York Steak, Spinach & Benedict-Bagel - I didn't order it but I had a piece. It was delicious also! The Spinach went really well with the steak. 

Thank you Rise and Shine for the great experience. I will be back every time I go to Vegas. I just wished you opened up another one over here in Southern California. That would be a GREAT investment."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was great. Only complaint is there is not one in Los Angeles. Take care of Amber she is a gem."}
{"text":"Love that they have French press coffee! I use this place for business meetings in the afternoon on weekdays and it's perfect! I love their decor too."}
{"text":"Not the best place. Nothing authentic or original, the cup of bread is microwaved dough that stiffens almost instantly after hitting the table. I'm a huge foodie and do my best in trying new breakfast/brunch places and sadly, this one left a sour taste in my mouth. The staff is great and attentive but the food didn't measure up. Sorry Rise & Shine.... I tried."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! There menu is full of options & the food is really good & love there smoothies & fresh squeezed orange juice. Our server Maria was amazing too. Everyone should definitely stop by and check this breakfast spot out"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time here.  The food is always good.  This time the service seems slow.  It took about 20 minutes before we even got water on the table.  By the time our waitress came to our table we placed our drink me good order.  She even forgot that I ordered water.  Maybe just a bit too busy.  This is a popular place.  The food was good tho - had corned beef hash and eggs."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Everyone is super friendly and the place is cute and clean. First time here but won't be our last. We were looking for a great breakfast place and found one!"}
{"text":"This was by far one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas.  I own a concierge business in Henderson and went there with one of my clients.  It was excellent!  Try it out, you will be pleased.  C Hubel"}
{"text":"Unbeknownst to us, we walked in 15 min before closing.  I asked when they were shutting down because it was late afternoon and was informed that the doors closed at 3 BUT they were insistent that we please come in and enjoy ourselves.  We even heard shouts from the kitchen for us to come in and sit down.

Our server told us to take all the time we need and we never once felt like we were keeping anyone from going home.  Our experience was super relaxed.  The management was incredibly accommodating and pleasant.

The food we delicious and very much to our liking.  The only reason I didn't not give a 5 out of 5 stars was because I thought the portion for my corned beef hash and eggs was a little light for the price.  Other than that we were extremely happy with the food and will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"I'm gunna give my first visit to this place 3 stars. Then again, we went on the most craziest day which was Mother's Day so it was complete chaos. We sat near where they toasted the bread. Here's my complaint... some of the girls that handled the toast did not use gloves, tongs or even paper while handling the bread. This visit I watched all the waitresses and waiter make their toast, there was 3 girls in particular that used their bare hands the entire time and served the bread straight to their tables that way.... uh... GROSS! But kudos to the ones that did use the tongs and didn't use their bare hands. I have been in the food industry for a while and cross contamination this is a big no no for me. 

Here's my experience on the 2nd visit. Thank God It wasn't busy, we were seated right away. Our server was ON POINT this visit. Very friendly and thorough with our order, used tongs with our toast (5 stars for him!) and he checked on us every now and then if we needed anything without being annoying. Lol Before he served us our plates, he had gloves on putting all the finishing touches to our plate. He made this visit worth coming back. Thank you Gilbert for the excellent service!!! Hopefully we can ask for him all the time. 

I love how the staff is dressed in their pajamas. It really does fit the name for Rise and Shine. Love the flower umbrellas hanging from the ceiling too! In my opinion, the price is a lil high for the food BUT.... you are paying for the experience and someone is cooking you a great meal. 5 stars to the Chefs for making me the steak, avocado and mushroom/spinach omelette. My food was cooked to perfection. The food actually tasted better since they weren't crazy busy. I don't even eat hash browns but man.... it was seasoned well and had the crisp to it, I ate it and that's rare! On yelp, I kept seeing everyone post the Cup of Bread and of course.... it was delicious! I think everyone should order that when they come to visit this place.

I will be back for sure! So glad it's close to my place too! Thank you Rise and Shine!"}
{"text":"Once again, they never disappoint. Vanessa, the manager, stopped by our table and we chatted about our love (maybe obsession is a better word) for this place. This is our first stop here of two for our trip this time around. Thank you Rise & Shine for making us wonderful food again. You've got costumers for life"}
{"text":"I loved the hash browns here. They were some of the best hash browns I've had. The rest of my breakfast was perfect as well. I missed the pot of bread and accidentally asked for toast instead. I then tried some of my husband's and it was so good. The staff was really friendly and so helpful. If I ever drive through Vegas again, I will try my hardest to stop here. Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service!  Our waitress, Kris, was attentive to every detail, friendly and outgoing.  And the food was awesome!  Kris recommended the Hazelnutnutella cappuccino--soooo yummy!

It's a bit of a drive from home, but well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Who said size doesn't matter?! 

Even if I don't finish it, I still like em big! 

Frosted banana pancakes full order is immense! Too much pancake for my tummy. But nothing that I couldn't wrap up for later. Super fluffy and moist! I probably put down one piece and became wayyy too full! Haha

Decided to try something out of my usual brunch order also and went for the biscuits and gravy! Boy was I stoked on this! The Gravy was muy delicioso. I didn't hold back on the carb intake this morning at all. The more the merrier. 

On  to other means, service was great, price was a bIt pricey but worth it. The servers wear pajamas to work. I thought it was a joke at first. But super cool touch! It makes me want to work here. 

Extra bonus Points for being a really well kept, and clean restaurant. Would return and would recommend"}
{"text":"Location was on the noisy side. The food was ok nothing to rave about. The servers were nice and pleasant... but a bit slow."}
{"text":"Pot of bread.... nothing else has to be said. 
Yes, good food, nice servers in cute pj's, order the pot of bread and it will make you smile. I don't even eat bread and I order it."}
{"text":"This weekend was crazy!  Last night was a night full of libations and great friends.  This morning I woke up on my best friend's couch with an appetite.  I was told a little gem was right around the corner and that I really needed to try it out.  Why not?  It's time to grub!

The strip mall in Southern Highlands is such a wonderful mall with a lot of different businesses.  Restaurants, hair salons, gyms, you name it.  Very delightful.  Rise & Shine was located in the southwest corner of the strip mall next to Tropical Smoothie Café.  When we got out of the car, we saw a few families waiting outside, so I knew it was going to be good.  We ended up waiting about 20 minutes for our table.  When you walk into this place, you are instantly taken to a whimsical story book.  The exposed air ducts are distracted by hanging umbrellas shaped and pictured like spring flowers.  The subtle orange and lime green walls are decorated with huge cow pictures.  The floor to almost ceiling windows are bordered by decorated clay mosaic-type arrangement.  This place is cute!  Our server's name was Lisa.  From the moment she greeted us, she was nothing but amazing!  Such an inviting personality and she really took the time to make sure our experience was top notch.  I LOVED HER!!

For starters, I got the fresh squeezed orange juice for $3.25 and the cup of coffee for $2.85.  Coffee was standard, however the OJ was out of this world!  Fresh squeezed is the only way to go!  You could tell it was authentic.  Not only was there pulp, there were also seeds in my drink!  LOVED IT!  For my meal, it was such a hard decision, but I decided with the New York Steak, Spinach & Benedict-Bagel for $13.50.  NY steak done the way you like it, over butter toasted bagel, topped with two eggs any-style, fresh spinach between the steak and bagel, hollandaise all over the place and hash brown potatoes.  OH-EM-GEE!!  I got the steak medium rare (the ONLY way to get it) and the eggs poached (duh, it's a Benedict!).  The steak was cooked perfectly with nice char marks.  The bagel served multiple purposes.  Not only did it create the Benedict, it soaked up any juices from the steak and hollandaise.  The spinach offered a light, crisp texture to the dish.  The hash browns were cut in big strips and cooked amazingly.  Browned with a crunch, but not dark enough to be considered burnt.  You break the yolk from the egg and mix it with the hollandaise sauce and it completely ties the dish together.  Hollandaise is not too lemony and not to runny.  On the top, they drizzle a little balsamic glaze which offered a slightly sweet and tangy element.  This dish was AH-MAZE-ING and I will highly recommend it to anyone!  

You guys, this place was out of this world!  So worth the wait, so worth the future drives (I live close to Boulder City).  I kept telling my best friends that this place was the perfect end to an epic weekend.  I truly believe it and think you need to stop reading this already and get your butt to Rise & Shine!"}
{"text":"WORTH THE TRIP. My favorite breakfast place, awesome ambiance, AMAZING food, always amazing service. If you're thinking IHOP, spend the same amount of money for an experience and meal that's 10x better! 10/10 would eat again, recommend to everyone I know, always"}
{"text":"I love this place! Everyone here is always so friendly and open to assisting me. I think it's great that they have happy workers who love their job! They get to wear their pajamas to work and they are literally never in a bad mood or crabby no matter how early it is. 

The interior is SOOOO cute! They have twirling flower umbrellas on the ceiling that instantly put you in an amazing mood.

My favorite is their eggs Benedict with spinach instead of ham! You can also substitute shaved turkey as a option. Their food always comes out in time, and my water is literally refilled every 10 minutes. I can't complain. I will definitely try to come here as much as I can since I live about 35 minutes away from here :("}
{"text":"We had a great experience at this restaurant on July 4th.  The food was fabulous.   We loved the bread in a cup and the creamy  sauce that came with it.  I had the Eggs Benedict which was outstanding.   The crunchy waffle was also very good.   Our waitress Ashley was very attentive.  We had some questions for the Manager Vanessa  and she was so nice!  Great customer service from the waitress and the Manager!   There was four of us and the bill was very reasonable at just under $40.   Everybody liked what they ordered.  I do definitely recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"maybe i was expecting too much with all the great reviews, but we could have passed on this place. came for sunday brunch. waited about 20 minutes before being seated at the booths. What bugged was that they were sooooo slow with cleaning the tables! the booth area that we sat at could have been readily available the moment we walked in if someone just had moved the dirty dishes! our waitress was nice but didn't pay attention to the fact that we had no silverware. the press coffee is strong but i guess i'm not a fan of illy's (not very aromatic). the steak definitely needed more flavoring (very bland), the hollindaise sauce runny and sour. hubby didn't think the chilaquiles was extrodinary either. overall, it's one of them \"we came, we tried, we're.never coming back\" places."}
{"text":"Great food & great customer service! Desire is very nice and attentive! Definitely coming back to try the cup of bread!"}
{"text":"I love it when locally owned and operated restaurants survive in LV.   The place is absolutely cute with their huge flowers spinning from the ceiling and the servers in their pajamas.  This is one of my favorite spots to do breakfast on the weekends.   Everyone I bring here raves about the place too. 
 
The food is really good.  Some of the notable things I've had here include:
 
- Chicken Fried Steak (Thick and delicious gravy.  Steak might be a little too thickly battered.  Feel a little guilty eating it =)  Tasty hash browns on the side)

- Two Egg Breakfast (Think grand slam, but much tastier!  Not crazy about the kielbasa, so I'll stick with the sausage or bacon next time)

- Corned Beef Hash (Not like the smushy corned beef - its \"real\"!)

- Southwest Turkey Panini (Panini's here seem like a good option for lunch!)

- And always get their cute little pot of bread! (A light and fluffy Cinnamon roll - Yum!)
 
Like everyone else says, the service here is good.  Always kind with a smile.  I wouldn't say the food is OMG, but its solid.  Prices might be a tiny bit on the more expensive side, but I think it's worth it for the lovely experience"}
{"text":"This is THE BEST kept secret in Las Vegas. Almost debated on reviewing, so I could be selfish and KEEP it a secret, but it was so good, I have to give the owners props. 

Here are all the reasons this place deserves MORE than 5 stars.

- Came at 10am on a Saturday and everyone was friendly. We actually had no wait, but I think that was more luck :) But it's still a positive in my book.
- Bread in a Pot. Delicious cinnamon swirled bread that was soft and buttery. Almost like a croissant... warm and came with whipped butter and strawberry jam. TO DIE FOR!!!
- My Man got the filet wrapped in bacon with eggs - cooked perfectly. The meat was tender, and you could tell it wasn't just cooked properly but that this place orders high quality ingredients.
- I got the chicken fried steak and eggs, and WHOA, the outside was cooked so crispy, and flavorful. Had a little spice kick to it which made it even better. Eggs cooked perfectly. 
- The side of potatoes were seasoned like an expect would. Not too salty, full of flavor. I don't like ketchup, and at other places I always end up with bland hash browns that need flavor and ketchup is the obvious choice but these tasted excellent plain. TWO thumbs up!!
- They serve illy coffee, and it is so good. Much better than typical diner coffee. It was refilled without me asking - another thumbs up!
- The server was friendly and cheery but not TOO cheery if you know what I mean 
- 3/4 through our meal, the owner stopped by. I think this is what tipped the review. He was friendly, and I LOOOOOOVE when someone in charge stops by your table. They should come by when things are good and bad, and not just when there is a customer complaint. He truly wanted to see how everything was, and it was very personable. Obviously we raved about the place to him, and I can't say enough what a great first impression it gave us.
- My man is an executive chef, and even he said this is the best place we have EVER had breakfast (totally exceeds Hash House, Egg & I, Cracked Egg, or ANY OTHER PLACE)


We will be back for sure. Our favorite thing on the weekends is to go out for breakfast, and this is definitely our new spot."}
{"text":"Man this place has gone downhill fast! Last three experiences here were awful. I don't eat meat but found bacon in my omelette twice. Today I ordered my omelette to go.  When I get there she tells me it's $17+ for an omelette and ice tea???? This better be amazing! She brings me my tea and food and thankfully I checked it and oopps no toast. Then she hands me my shot of tea that cost $3 !!! It was tiny! So tiny i sent it back for a refund. I work hard for my money and that was simply a rip off! Too top it off When I get home to eat my food I find a hair in it! Yes a gross  tiny hair! Some $17 omelette ! Needless to say they have officially lost me, and anyone I can tell not to go there, as a customer! It's too bad I thought Vegas actually had an awesome breakfast place finally."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan! Wasn't busy at all on a hot Friday morning in June. We were seated right away. The decor is very cute, with the colorful flower umbrellas, and it must be nice to work in your PJs! Our waiter suggested the green smoothie, which was indeed just a teeny bit sweet from the honeydew melon. The cup of bread was amazing! Like a cinnamon roll with the cream cheese frosting on the side for dipping. We ended up ordering two of them! I got the avocado eggs Benedict with hash browns. The balsamic vinegar drizzled on top was a little different, but it worked! We would definitely return next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Cute breakfast joint just outside of the Las Vegas strip. The servers wear pajamas in the restaurant so hey, you can really wear whatever you want and not look crazy! 

The servers were friendly and quick to serve. The menu has a variety of food ranging from fresh juices to waffles, breakfast burritos, pancakes, and omelettes. It's a wide variety that can really meet the needs of anyone visiting the restaurant. We ordered the breakfast burrito, which we split. It was delicious and flavorful."}
{"text":"Eggcellent Breakfast 

Great little breakfast spot of the strip.
Friends recommended this spot to us for a delicious breakfast. 
The decor was extraordinary it was like a page out of Alice in Wonderland. Colourful  upside down flower umbrellas decorated the ceiling, some walls were decorated with broken tile mosaic and the walls were painted in bright vibrant colors. Great and friendly service. All wait staff were in pajamas adding to the relaxed ambience. 

With coffee we had a creative cinnamon roll called Bread in a Cup. It was served in a small coffee mug with a side of cream cheese frosting to dip the roll in. Lots of fun to eat.
I stepped out of my comfort breakfast zone and tried the house specialty it was the Spice Rubbed Rib Eye Steak Chilaquiles. It was tasty!! My steak was well prepared, the ranchero flavored chips were a perfect crispy texture. It was layered with refried beans, cheddar and cojita cheese, eggs, green onions, sour cream and a excellent homemade salsa! 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast or lunch place. Food is great along with the service. It is always very busy which is always a good sign. Just have to go before or after those busy times."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place for breakfast. We live down the street and did not want to drive to the other side of town to enjoy breakfast. So we came here. We were not disappointed! The food was delicious and the staff was very nice. Laura was the sweetest woman! Since it was our first visit, she treated us to two pots of bread which was sweet and savory! The wait staff wear pajamas and the atmosphere is extremely cozy! We will be going there again because the food was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"We were staying off strip and this was the closest breakfast joint to our hotel so we stopped in. The waitresses were super nice and provided great service. They also wear pajamas. Get your mind out of the gutter though, nothing naughty to see here. The decor is really unique and colorful. I had the Chorizo burrito and it was outstanding. We'll definitely hit this joint again if we're even south of the strip again."}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast we've had in Vegas! Peanut butter and blueberry French toast and pot of bread were amazing!! Service was friendly and great"}
{"text":"It's my dad's first time in Vegas after at least 14years. I wanted to take him to M resort studio buffet but found out they no longer have breakfast. Oh no!!!

I quickly yelp'd around the nearest breakfast places and found these guys. The pot of bread seemed like a unique idea and the photos looked great! 

Arrived at around 830am. Quaint little place in a shopping plaza. Loved how the servers wear Jammies (must be the best work uniform ever).

Decor: simple. I honestly do not remember anything that stuck out besides the turning floral umbrellas on the ceiling and the \"cow and egg\" advertisement on the wall. 

Orange juice: to my surprise, freshly squeezed.

Dads steak and eggs: steak was very tender and eggs cooked to a perfectly requested sunny side up. 

The hash: very unique. They look like flat pasta noodles cut in smaller segments. It tasted very fresh with a perfect crunch. 

My chicken fried steak: my steak was also very flavorful and tender. It was paired with a delicious gravy. I am not a big chicken fried steak fan but damn, this was good. 

Husband's chicken and waffle: the portion size was good. Nicely breaded chicken breast with a waffle. Chicken was tender and juicy despite being fried. 

Their pot of bread became 'tea cup bread' when we visited. It did not look too appealing since the shape was funky and some overfilled the cup. However, they were nice and warm out of the oven and very, very delicious. Dad and I are not fans of sweet bread but this was perfectly flavored with cinnamon and a bit of sweetness. Butter and tea cup bread for the win!

Pricing: a bit higher than your normal breakfast restaurant but hey, you're paying for fresh food. Totally worth it!

I am very glad our hotel decided to cancel their breakfast buffet because we got to experience something new and not your usual Vegas meal :)

I would definitely recommend and return at my next trip!!"}
{"text":"I finally found a reputable breakfast place that I can be happy about in my neighborhood!!!  

The quality of the food is fantastic!!! 
It's very well prepared and done the right way usually I have to go to the Strip to find something like this.

It gets busy but not packed so you shouldn't have to wait long for seats. 
The staff are super friendly and provide great customer service.

Here are the items that are my favorite!!!

The Red Velvet Chocolate Chip Pancakes.
Southern Style Chicken Fried Steak.
Buttermilk Biscuits and Gravy 
Rise and Shine Chilaquiles 
Ham & Eggs Benedict"}
{"text":"I live close by so had to try it. The food is average at best and the prices are outrageous. I would rather go to Hash House A Go Go or Metro Diner for better food and more reasonable prices"}
{"text":"Delicious! First of all ...We went here on Mother's Day and there was only a 10 min wait at the location in Southern Highlands. I was amazed to see there were tables to sit and wait (a rare thing here) , the staff were so polite and inviting , the service was excellent and the food OMG ... came out hot and so delicious! I will definitely come back ... and we live all the way out in Centennial Hills !"}
{"text":"Food was great! I ordered Old Fashioned Pancakes. They come in 2 or 4, I got 2 and it was more than enough! My husband got Extra Protuen Egg White Omlette...yummo!
Our server, Maria was attentive and made sure that we were happy with our food. Coffee regularly came around the room. 
We love it and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken & waffles.  Absolutely the worst coffee I've ever tasted.  Bitter swill.  Two sugars and 50% Creamer and its still unpalatable.  Impressively bad coffee"}
{"text":"The place is cute,like the umbrellas on ceiling,but the omelette was cold and hardly had any mushrooms,even they charge you 95c for them!"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place because it's within walking distance of my house. It would be so nice to walk to weekend brunch but can't say I'll do that because this place isn't that good. I'd rather drive somewhere with better prices and better food. The chilaqules were the best thing that we had. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffle was horrible. Cold, dry, thin and stale texture. The chicken was good but not great. I didn't like their maple syrup, it had cinnamon in it and with chicken? Yuck. I ended up pulling it off and eating it alone. I asked for blue cheese dressing so I could salvage my meal and dip the chicken in it and all they had was cheap bottles ranch style dressing. The service was the worst part of the whole experience. The server treated us like we were bothering her and she was missing half the time...like seriously missing like not in the room or the kitchen."}
{"text":"This place is something special. My family and I had breakfast here on our way back home from Las Vegas and the food was absolutely incredible. I even told my wife that I would drive here from the Inland Empire in California just to have breakfast and drive back. The food is that good! I ordered scrambled eggs, bacon and waffles with hash browns on the side. The eggs were perfect, bacon was crispy, waffle was melt in your mouth and the hash browns were the best tasting I've had the pleasure to eat anywhere. My oldest son had the red velvet pancakes and the order was extremely generous. The cream cheese syrup that came with it was exquisite. The wife and my youngest son shared corned beef hash, eggs and bacon and the order was so big, the both of them could not finish it. My wife also had the french press coffee with her meal and that was incredible as well. The decor is original and the wait staff all wear pajamas as their uniforms which I thought was really cool.  Speaking of the wait staff, our server Riley was awesome, very attentive and made sure our beverages were never empty. The place was clean and you can tell the staff go the extra mile to make your meal very pleasurable. I can't wait to go back to this place when I get a chance."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!  First time here trying this place. I had a Avo-Veggie Benedict with a hollandaise, burgundy sauce. Excellent! Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. The customer service is amazing. The orange juice is fresh squeezed and tastes like you're drinking it straight from the fruit. The Steakhouse omelette is the best thing to get! By far my favorite place to eat breakfast!!"}
{"text":"We went here because Yelp told us it was the breakfast place closest to where we were staying.  Truth be told, I'd be willing to drive for hours to eat here. We came around 10 a.m. We waited about 30 minutes to be seated, but once we were seated, the service and fast and attentive. I ordered the chicken and waffles and oh my goodness. I've never had a better breakfast in my life. The breading on the chicken was light, crispy, and perfectly seasoned. The chicken was tender and juicy and a great contrast to the warm and fluffy waffle. The maple syrup was just buttery enough to tie it all together. I already want to go back for more. We will be back."}
{"text":"my gf and i come here pretty often since we live down the street. normally love it here. the young man in the black and red pj outfit has amazing customer service each time we come. but today we got served by the older lady in pink pjs and she just wasn't as friendly, don't know if she got annoyed because we switched up our orders a few times but sheesh that's just how it is when you work in the food industry. anyways, i think you guys should fix your policy on how if we don't get meat/protein you should substitute it for something else. Ex: we got the salmon and bacon bagel, we don't eat meat so we asked to substitute more salmon if we don't get bacon. She said we couldn't do that. I asked if we could sub for avocado instead and she said that's not an option either, we would have to get it on the side for an extra cost. Most food places offer substitutes if you don't eat meat. I work in the food industry and we don't charge extra for replacing meat with avocado? :-)"}
{"text":"Pot of Bread. 
Italian roast coffee
Flower parasol chandeliers 
This is a great breakfast spot 
I have never had anything less than a fantastic meal with friendly, cordial staff. This is how every day should start"}
{"text":"KIRA KIRA KIRA! This review is for her because she totally put on her A game com for our table! She was so pleasant and so hospitable! She made sure everything was going well with our food. I accidentally dropped my glass and it broke on the table and she came by in a heartbeat to clean it all up! So glad we got her as a server :)  can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The waitstaff was incredible. Our waitress, Lisa, had a sweet and positive energy that made our experience truly phenomenal. The food was also amazing. I definitely recommend the bread in the pot and the steak and chilaquiles. Great coffee, too! This place is a breakfast gem!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going here for many years, basically since it opened.  Although a little pricey, it was always worth it b/c the quality.
As of late, the quality of food isn't the same.  I've always replaced hashbrowns with fruit (strawberries, blueberries, and bananas), and the serving has always been generous.  The past 2 times they've put the fruit in the smallest dish, almost like a dish that you usually get syrup in.  It's been about 1/4 of what I used to get.  Then today, first thing this morning, they ran out of bananas.  
I don't believe their eggs are organic anymore, they're just different!  I don't mind spending the extra money for quality, but it's just not quality.  Also, they recently changed the coffee, and my husband doesn't care for it at all.
The service is still awesome, we love Riley!  Please stop cutting corners, we will go elsewhere if things don't improve"}
{"text":"I have some odd, unexplained affinity for brunch. Something about eating eggs yet not having to wake so early for them gets me excited. As much as I love brunch, my brother outshines me in this respect tenfold. Every time I leave the house for it or come home from it, he seems to always criticize my choice in restaurant - usually exclaiming \"What about Rise & Shine? They're so much better\". Well David S., I finally tried them, and jesus! Why didn't I listen to you before?

A coworker and I decided to catch up over some brunch (she, too, shares my love for breakfast foods at normal people hours). After wavering in between this place and another establishment, we finally just took my brother's advice. The service was a bit slow at first, but was amazing once it picked up. Our waitress, Nicole (I believe that's her name) was so sweet and very attentive. Usually, I always gulp four glasses of water prior to the start of any meal. She was on top of her game - making conversation and filling our waters promptly.

To the food, we had both ordered the Baked Blueberry Croissant French Toast. When it came out, I think we were both about to die. This dish is not for the faint of heart or those struck with blueberry indifference. Literally, the dish was unrecognizable underneath the mound of blueberries. What croissant are you talking about? If that wasn't enough, there's a ramekin of the same blueberry sauce on the side! Jesus. One bite in, and I was in love. The blueberry sauce, candied walnuts, and croissant were euphoric. Not overtly sweet, just tart enough, with the perfect crunch and nuttiness of the walnuts. The portion is perfect for the price. I ended up taking half of it home in order to both save my waistline and taunt my brother by affecting his.

We had meandered a bit afterwards, inflicted with the pains of a food coma. Multiple people, other than our waitress, had stopped by for lively banter and to check up on the meal. Management was positively delightful - so genuinely sweet without any schmooze. 

Weeks later, I still feel somewhat guilty. Indulgence at its best is definitely what you'll find here. Unfortunately for me, the only occasion I can bring myself to come back here for will be my birthday - my waistline will thank me."}
{"text":"4 stars for the egg Benedicts, but everything else we've tried so far hasn't been very good- my mom got an omelet that was dry, I ordered chiquitos which came out as version of an ugly nacho- not edible.... while the hash browns are very good they are just hash browns. The customer service is great but another disappointing thing that happened was we order the ABC breakfast for my 16
Month old baby, instead of meat we wanted a little pinch of fried mushrooms considering a he's a baby and we don't mix dairy and meat together, this was something they wouldn't do unless we wanted to pay extra,.... which we did- but then left me thinking value wise if the mushrooms are more than the meat then what quality of meat are they using here?  
Anyway this place is really great in some ways but if the food isn't that good then I don't know if we'll be coming back a third time."}
{"text":"What a gem of a place we stumbled upon by accident. From our (very little) experience in Vegas, there are so many dining options and many places you can go wrong.
It was a Thursday morning, and we were seated immediately. The whole staff was chipper, and helpful. My husband and I both ordered build your own omelettes with hash browns and a side of toast or pot of bread. 
Order the pot of bread!! It sounds strange and we almost didn't try it but it was delicious! It is half cinnamon roll, half bread roll, all baked and served in a petite mug with cream cheese frosting. 
Our omelettes were cooked perfectly, the hash browns were thick and hearty and weren't too greasy, and although we didn't get any this trip they have a full juice bar running in the corner! We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Steak and eggs were amazing. So were the chicken and waffles my boyfriend had. The French Press was cool. Good food. Waited about an hour for just my bf and I, I believe it was a weekday morning. But it was so worth it! The waitresses are dressed in cute pajamas. You could obviously tell they are running around like crazy because of how busy and packed the restaurant gets. I know how it is because I'm a waitress too. They are fast though. The service was great. We could tell our waitress was busy but she took the time to ask us how we were doing and showed us how to work the French press without talking to us in a rushed tone. Look up, they have awesome twirling umbrellas as ceiling fans. Come early to avoid the long wait. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hello, and welcome to Rise & Shine (Henderson). We are big fans of the original, so we knew we had to check this one out. We arrived and expected a wait but were sat right away. Soon after drink orders were taken and we were given a few minuted to browse the menu. The menu was mostly like the original with a few exceptions, so we had a good idea what we wanted. I ordered the chicken fried steak and Josie had the french toast. My Chicken fried steak was of course quite good. However, it did have a different flavor than what I remember and it may be the batter. Either way i was quite delicious and I ordered more gravy because I can never have too much. The french toast was as usually quite delicious and seasoned and cooked well. The staff as usual was attentive and on top of our beverages. I might add that Josie had the hot chocolate and it was visually stunning as well as tasty.
Thank you for eating at Rise & Shine (Henderson). Yes, we will return and I am sure it will be as great as it always is. So, go and get some good breakfast. you won't regret it."}
{"text":"First time here but we loved the breakfast. This restaurant is just a little cheaper than eating on the Vegas  strip but the food quality was better than some of the strip options so it was worth the 3 mile drive out on our way back to LA. There wasn't a long wait for a party of two but the place did look a little busy but this was okay for a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"This place is so over-rated. The only reason we went there is for convenience three times since living in Southern Highlands. 

It's amazing this place runs like it does considering its owner was a big strip vp of f and b with Caesars corp. There is zero leadership in this place. Absent owner. 

Arrive. Dirty tables everywhere; but have to wait 15 minutes for a table. It's Sunday folks staff accordingly. Finally seated. Menus are laminated; all of the laminated corners are peeling back and dirty. 

Server shows up after we sit for 10 minutes and says sorry I will be back. 5 minutes later takes a drink order. Cloudy old iced tea. Gross. No sweet and low on table. Had to ask for it. 

We order our food. Takes 15 minutes. We watch as dirty tables around us sit dirty for up to 20 minutes as they have a wait list. What a shame. 

Ordered chicken sandwiches. Comes out with what looks like a 3-4oz half chicken breast on a big bun. Hardly sized properly to fill the bun. Plate smoking hot with the lettuce and tomato sitting directly on the hot plate. Now cooked and wilted. Comes with nothing? No mayo? Nothing?? Fries cold and a very small portion. Embarrassing. Asked for mayo to put on the sandwich. Also ordered a French onion soup. Came out with our sandwiches rather than before. Soup had so much thyme in it......tasted like a beef broth thyme soup. Gross. Went to get ketchup from the condiment caddy and it was empty. 

This place is dirty. Lacks the basics. Server was scatter-brained. No management presence. Bussers moving at a snails pace. Cooks eating behind the line. We rode our bikes to lunch. When leaving we saw two servers out back smoking. One was our server. Now I know why she was not around and why we waited so long. Wonder if she washed her hands. 

I guess three times is a charm. We want this place to be great because it's so close. Not again. Shame on you owner; you know better."}
{"text":"3 stars with the potential of 5 stars.  Rise and shine lacks service but makes up for it with there food.   I personally think they were overwhelmed with the amount of business they are receiving.  But there breakfast was awesome.  One the best steaks I've ever had!  And this is a breakfast joint...good stuff!  I'll be back to re-evaluate."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place. Everything is so good. Their fresh squeeze orange juice is just amazing. My sister doesn't even like OJ and this she loved! Their coffee is good. Their cup-o-bread is BOMB!! Even their fruit plate sets them apart from other breakfast places. Pineapple, strawberries, bananas, blueberries, and melon! I mean YUM!! I haven't had something I didn't enjoy. I also love the atmosphere in here!"}
{"text":"Great food & servers but I'm only giving 3 stars because EVERYTIME we come there is a long wait only because they don't have a bus boy & the hostess just stands around looking around"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great service! I had the Texas Toast Style French Toast and it was delicious! I can't wait to go back and try something new next time. Their menu had anything you could ever want for breakfast and SO much more! I would definitely recommend Rise & Shine!"}
{"text":"Love this place. We live in Henderson and make the drive over to Southern Highlands to have breakfast here on Sunday's. I love the Cinnamon French Toast.  Be ready to wait a few minutes when you come if it's on the weekend -- it's very popular."}
{"text":"First time here and it was awesome. Laurel, our server, is a doll. She was sweet and kind. She made me and my friend feel right at home. My friend had an omelet and a side of pancakes. He ate everything. I ordered fried steak, egg whites, and hash browns. This is my first time having red meat in about three years. The steak was the best I've ever had in Las Vegas. Everything was fresh. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. It is good and service is great. I love that they are in their pajamas as a uniform. ( almost like me when I cook breakfast for my family) It is a typical breakfast place for family. A lot of people come here but the waiting time when the place is busy is not bad either. Yes, I will be back here and I do recommend this place . :)"}
{"text":"This place is the best breakfast spot in Las Vegas! They are known for their steak and eggs and chicken and waffles with cinnamon syrup. Delicious! 

On the weekends expect a short wait to get in as this place is always jamming with locals and visitors. Usually 25-30 minutes. 

The service is some of the best in Las Vegas with an extremely friendly and accommodating staff. 

Make sure to check this place out when having a craving for breakfast. May be the best breakfast spot in town!"}
{"text":"I am visiting Las Vegas from California and I decided to eat breakfast at a restaurant that was not in a casino. I Yelped and found this restaurant that had 4 stars with over a thousand reviews. I decided to check it. I didn't expect for the staff to be dressed in pajamas. That made me giggle a bit, but great concept. The umbrellas on the ceiling were funny as well.  The extra protein omelette was excellent. The staff was great and the restaurant was very clean. I would come back and recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The chicken fried NY steak and eggs sounded amazing. Not as great as it sounded. Overall, meal was ok. Not worth the 18 bucks I paid for it. Sadly I've had better chicken fried steak for far less. The quality of the steak did not shine like I assumed it would. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the hash browns were well seasoned, but not enough to make it 4 stars."}
{"text":"This just became my favorite breakfast spot in Vegas! I sat at the counter and ordered poached eggs with avocado and hash browns. 
The best hash browns! You'd think hash browns are hash browns?! Not after you try them at Rise & Shine! Busting with flavor! No extra seasoning needed! Just the perfect texture! 
Every server and host was beyond friendly and accommodating. They all had a smile on their face and were fast and attentive. And coffee kept coming! 
This is definitely a must!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast food I have tasted in a long time and we didn't have to wait to be seated. I guess you can call it timing. If you are not a big eater I strongly suggest sharing meals because the servings are big."}
{"text":"This place seems pretty great. By the name I expected a diner experience, but I am pleasantly surprised. We were in Vegas for a convention and needed breakfast before driving back to California. 

The wait staff are really nice and efficient. The place is clean and decorated very colorfully. 

They serve Lavazza coffee, which is my favorite! You can even get a French press of coffee if you so desire. 

They have a \"Pot of bread\" which is a dinner roll mixed with cinnamon and sugar baked in a small pot. Not too sweet and quite delicious. 

The portions of everything that I've seen come out are quite large. No way you can leave hungry. More likely you'll want to share. 

They have non GMO organic hot sauce on the table, not sure if anything else on the menu is. 

I had steak and eggs and it was very yummy. The steak tasted grilled, not chewy or anything. The eggs were perfectly cooked. I like my hash browns crispy and these were not but the were still good. 

My husband had corned beef hash and really liked his too. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Perfect hangover breakfast, like a warm hug."}
{"text":"I came in for breakfast around 9am and the place was already busy! However, I had a party of 4 people and we didn't wait for long at all to be seated. As we got seated we were greeted by a nice sever who gave us as much time as we needed and since it was our first time there I have to admit we took about 15-20 minutes before deciding what we wanted. I ordered the Ultimate Steak and Eggs w/ the \"bread-o-cup.\" After waiting for about 15-20 minutes our food came out and their portioning was big! My favorite part was the bread-o-cup, it's a bread with cinnamon and they give you a side of glaze to dip your bread. The total for my plate alone was $18 including tax. Our server was amazing she always checked up on us and always had a positive attitude, she recommended the bread-o-cup to me and she was excited for me to try it. Also, their employee's here wear pajamas, it's so cute! This breakfast restaurant's work attire is so unique and creative, the environment is filled with families and happy morning people in my opinion haha. I recommend you come in to this place right when they open or between 7am and 9am because anytime after that they have a long wait. When we were done eating there were people waiting inside to be seated as well as groups outside to be seated. This is a great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I picked up take-out to go and the food was pretty good I had the steak and eggs while I was waiting for my food the staff was very friendly and helpful offered me a free refill on my drink without even asking. It was a surprisingly short wait time and the food was just as delicious when I took it home."}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect brunch, along with great service. Be sure to try their pot of bread!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times I feel as if the quality wasn't there this time. I wasn't satisfied all the way with the dish. (Chilaquiles) it wasn't bad either. Not sure how to really explain everything else was good."}
{"text":"Very mediocre and overpriced. Super slow service. Waitress was totally overwhelmed and it wasn't even that busy. 

It's a shame because this is the closest breakfast spot near me and I really wanted to love it."}
{"text":"We came out on Saturday morning for breakfast. 

This was my first time eating here, although I had popped in once about 5 years ago and had a bite of a friend's steak:  it was delicious.

They were busy, but not packed, and we were seated right away.
Our server was very sweet, and very patient, as it took us a while to decide on what we wanted to try.  

I had the New York Steak, Spinach, and Benedict Bagel which came with potted bread, and my fella had the Spice rubbed rib eye steak chilaquiles, also with potted bread. We both had a tea and a coffee as well. 

So. 
Potted bread.  This was like a sweet, warm cinnamon bun in a little mug served with butter.  You really don't *need* the butter, its that good on its own, but the butter was tasty too.  I'd go back and order just this...a few of them.  They were awesome. 

When our breakfasts arrived, I was thrilled with mine.  It looked amazing, and tasted even better!  The steak was cooked to perfection: mid-rare, and seasoned beautifully.  The poached eggs had a lovely runny yolk, and the hollandaise was not too rich.  The spinach gave it a nice touch, and while I didn't really eat all of the bagel, it was delicious, and perfect for sopping up the yolk and juices from the steak. 

My fella's Spice rubbed rib eye steak chilaquiles LOOKED amazing.  I, unfortunately, was unable to try any, due to an avocado allergy.  We had asked for them to make it without avocado, but it came out with it on top.  My fella doesn't like avocado, but isn't allergic, so he just scraped it off, and our server apologized about it.  I was bummed that I didn't get to try it, but maybe next time. He really enjoyed it a lot, and the steak was great.  (that was on the side, no avocado!)

Really, the only reasons for the missing star is the avocado, and the fact that for a plain cup of coffee, and a plain bag of Earl Grey tea, it is $2.85 a piece.  That's a little steep for just brewed coffee and a tea bag, if you ask me, especially when we were never offered refills.  Honestly though, its not a huge deal, or a deal breaker, because the food was so delicious, and there was SO much of it!  

I have every intention to come back to Rise and Shine for breakfast again.  They have a good sized menu that I look forward to testing out!"}
{"text":"New breakfast spots are cropping up everywhere and I'm loving it ! Apparently the word is out - around 10 AM on a Saturday we had a 20 minute wait for two. 

The decor is absolutely adorable - hanging flowers are all over the place and the wait staff wears really cute pajamas - love it! 

The food we tried was all very good. My husband had the blueberry french toast strudel . It was like a slice of a delicious casserole. If you're in the mood  for sweet but not disgustingly so, I recommend this! We also tried the chicken and waffles which was good, especially if you haven't had Roscoe's. It was much, much better than the one at HHAGG, and at this point the best I've had in Vegas. It was a big chicken breast instead of fried chicken which did make it much easier to eat. The waffle was pretty boring, but well executed. The chicken was a touch spicy, and the whole thing was served with cinnamon syrup. I would get it again, but I can't say it's crave-worthy. 

Biggest bummer about this place was service was a disaster. Drinks were late and forgotten, the pot of bread supposed to be served prior to the meal was brought after, etc, etc. They all seemed very rushed and stressed out. Given how brand new this place is, they get a pass, but I would hope the service improves in the future! 

It's no Babycakes, but it does hold its' own. In a sea of breakfast spots at every corner, this place deserves a spot in anyone's short list ."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  Found my fav breakfast place in LV.  Their breakfast is so good you'll want to slap yo.... Someone. Bacon wrapped steak with eggs and truly home made tasting hush browns. Mmmmm good. Than I dug into my wife's order: velvet chocolate pancakes... One bite and I couldn't stop smiling, I forgot 5 bills I lost earlier gambling. World seemed brighter, there was childhood music playing somewhere in a background all of a sudden. It took me whole 5 minutes to come back to reality. Yes, this place will be our regular stop from now on!!"}
{"text":"So good! Waitress was awesome! Food was out fast and eggs, steak and everything was cooked to perfection! Best breakfast I've had in a while too bad we're not from Vegas or else we'd be a regulars!!!"}
{"text":"Really f***in' good steaks!!! Recommend like leave your house now to come eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Early morning breakfasts spot with great food and you can wear your pajamas to the restaurant?!??!  Yes, here at Rise and Shine you can wear your pajamas and have delicious food.  I stopped into rise and shine while completing  an early pick up and and this place is absolutely amazing. During my visit I ordered the parfait which was really good, I had the clover honey, strawberry and granola parfait.   It comes in a milkshake size glass with the granola on the bottom of the glass, then the next layer is fruit and then the next layer is the vanilla yogurt with the clover honey on top of the yogurt.    

I also ordered the chicken and waffle.  The waffle came out hot, fresh and flakey.   You could cut the waffle with a fork.  The chicken (one breast) that came with the waffle had a little kick of heat to it.  The chicken was cooked chicken fried steak style, because it did not have the bone in.  Overall, this is a great brunch spot."}
{"text":"Update: I think yhey gave me day old pot of bread? It was stale, dry, and cold. NOT FRESH. What a damn insult.

This is a highly popular item for it's freshness, taste, and oven hot delivery. Not today!"}
{"text":"Everything was so yummy!!!! French toast was to die for!!!! I also had the Lox and Cream cheese omelette omg I was in heaven. This place was so good we went twice during our Las Vegas 5 day trip."}
{"text":"Great food! Super friendly staff! A great place to start your morning off right with the most important meal of the day.

I am looking forward to having breakfast here again soon!"}
{"text":"ill be honest this wasnt my first pick. the line at Southpoint breakfast buffet was ridiculously long.  and after eating here im glad it was. this place is off the hook. google drove me through some weird residential area so i was skeptical coming in. coming in the ambience is stylish and contemporary but not enough to snob me off because all the waitresses are dressed in their pajamas! our waitress was very friendly even though my son had a tantrum attack she was very helpful and didn't really give me any dirty looks like most people would. we ordered the country fried steak and the banana crunch pancakes and also create my own omelet with all veggies it was all super yummy. Even the hash browns which I'm really not normally a fan of....was so delicious that I almost finish the whole thing!  I have a rule of generally not visiting the same place twice in a trip I would stop here again and have order the same exact items again and stuff my face! love this place but it gets busy."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way back from the Strip. Needless to say, we needed healthy food. The juices and the smoothies are absolutely delicious and made with real ingredients. The food came out hot and the service was amazing. Maria is very attentive and quick with whatever you need. Just avoid the waitress with the pink hair. She was loudly yelling at multiple coworkers for not seating her, all at the host stand. Not the best thing to walk into. But other than her, it was a great breakfast shop."}
{"text":"Excellent food and huge servings...worth every penny. The waitresses wear their PJ's. Very original great neighborhood restaurant. Much bigger on the inside than it looks from outside. I would recommend the Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"This is a popular breakfast spot in a suburban part of las vegas. I was excited to try this place because my boyfriend has been raving about the red velvet pancakes ever since he came here with a group of friends a while back. We finally made it to Vegas together and made this one of our foodie destination. My boyfriend got the steak and eggs which were very salty. I got the biscuits and gravy which were good but not the best I've ever had. We also got a stack of the red velvet pancakes. Now those were great especially with the cream cheese icing. The service however was very subpar. We only got our drinks refilled one time as we were leaving and our plates had already been cleared away. Additionally many of the staff were complaining about job related issues within earshot of the customers."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Steak & Chilliques is the best! Very good coffee. Friendly relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Items selected:

Pot of Bread - Cinnamon
Chicken and Waffles
Peanut Butter and Jelly French Toast
Illy Coffee with refills

Always on the lookout for a great local breakfast spot and already in Henderson for business reasons I decided to make my way over to \"Rise & Shine, a Steak & Egg Place\" largely based on the fact that anyone willing to go out on a limb and sport the website www.bestbreakfastvegas.com clearly warrants judgment; my verdict suggesting blatant false advertising.  Featuring a kitschy design with floral umbrellas hanging from the ceiling and servers in their pajamas plus a menu of breakfast and lunch classics ranging from classic egg dishes to more novel options such as red velvet pancakes service was spot on despite the early morning rush and with my order placed within moments of seating coffee and water remained filled to the brim at all times.  With good service and fun décor it was my hope that the food at Rise & Shine would indeed shine but perhaps because I didn't order \"Steak & Eggs\" the selections I tasted were average at best, the sort of place where big portions trump high quality ingredients - the chicken crispy but largely flavorless over a hotel lobby quality waffle and the pot of bread tasting mostly like yeast, something that Log Cabin 'syrup' and butter did not remedy.  Better in quality but still marred by low quality ingredients the French Toast would fare the best of the morning's options but given the location and the cost I can name no less than a dozen restaurants more deserving of the 'best breakfast vegas' title."}
{"text":"It was our first time at this place and we were greatly impressed with the food and the ambience. 
Our server Maria was at the top of her game - she made it very easy for us. She's a gem!! 
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Okay let me start off with my first visit at Rise and Shine was amazing. But I'm guessing it was because this was around the time they first opened up and they gotta shoot for the moon on great breakfast ya know.

But my last recent visit here, my pancakes were undercooked. Like I'm talking I cut it open and batter would seep out with my blueberries. Eggs were great, cooked perfectly. Was just disappointed to receive my favorite breakfast item and it being undercooked. 

Customer service has been, and still is very warm and friendly."}
{"text":"A bit conflicted about this place...not far from my house...every time I go there is some thing just a tad off...perhaps it is I who is a tad off...lol...reasonable prices and food is decent...more three stars than four"}
{"text":"Popular neighbor Resturant that is tucked into the corner of this everyday strip mall. The Steak n Eggs were far from everyday standards. The decor & the staff are all a little quirky, but in a good way. The steak & eggs were cooked perfectly. The steak had a correctly cooked  juicy medium inside, but the outside had a awesome texture, very similar to a nice high heat steak char. I believe they use a coffee ground rub on the steak. The eggs were scrambled & fluffy & the hash browns were plentiful & cooked properly. Bread in a cup choice was a nice added sweet enhancement to the breakfast. I would definitely visit again & try other delicious look items that were coming out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Amazing service, tried the avocado Benedict and it was one of the best breakfasts I may have ever had! Definitely recommend if you want to be away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and relax."}
{"text":"Yummy! The food was absolutely delicious,  the service was fantastic (and I love how all of the waitresses wore pajamas ), and the actually restaurant was very cute and quaint."}
{"text":"Soooo good! The hype everyone is making about their chicken and waffles and pot of bread is definitely valid. Their chicken and waffles is nowhere near Roscoe's quality, but it's a close second. Definitely the best in Vegas. Can't complain about the portion size either. The pot of bread is definitely not what I expected. I thought it'd just be a roll type of bread but I was wrong. To my surprise, it was more like a Cinnabon! And it looks small but it's still pretty filling. 

The servers and hostesses were extremely friendly as well. Our server was sweet and gladly answered any questions I had about the menu. Not to mention, they're all dressed in pajamas which makes the place even better lol.

The reason why I have this place 4 out of 5 starts is because of the steak and eggs I ordered, which were also talked highly about on Yelp reviews. Personally I didn't see what the big deal was. I've had better tasting steak and eggs at Southpoint during their late night specials. The size of the steak was decent but the flavor was eh. 

Other than that, I'd highly recommend this place for a staple breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Do i have words to describe how fabulous it was ? I don't think so. But i'll give it a try .
Our last meal in Vegas before going back to L.A..bored of hotels and wanted to try something else,somewhere else. I search for a breakfast place and this one got my attention as we were in the mood for steak and eggs.

Looked at the menu and with so many steak&eggs options,didn't really knew what to go for. Luis(our server) was knowledgeable and recommend us the Ryb eye . Also explained what cup-a-bread was and at first i said meh..maybe not. But he was so excited about it that i went for it. Great choice ! (They warm it up too)

The meat was flavorful and ,the hasbrown had green onions in it . Best steak ever ! I promise you. I ate at fancy steakhouses but this place make the other ones look like a joke.

Luis,you are great and your recommendations amazing ! Thank you !"}
{"text":"This place is cute and the staff are friendly! 

The food is fine but nothing special really. My husband and I went in yesterday and ordered 2 french press coffees, one orange juice, and 2 omelets. $38 dollars. This place is way over priced. Also it would be great if they had some more healthy options too. 

Ive been here about 4 times before and will probably end up here again at some point. The things is for the area they really have no competition. 

I want this place to do well but it needs some improving. Either up portions or lower prices. Also sat down at 11:15am and food got to us at 11:55, seriously!! 40 min for an omelette. They also used to have fresh jam but yesterday it was regular plastic containers."}
{"text":"This is one of the places I recommend to everyone. We are here at least once a week and if for some reason we don't get out there that often - we crave it like crazy.

The french press coffee is awesome and I am a big fan of the bacon wrapped filet bacon sandwich. The hubby loves the chicken & waffles. We both love the country fried steak BUT sometimes it has too much fat on it for our liking.
 I love the ambiance and great service.

We try to get there early enough to beat the rush and when the weather's right, we love eating on the patio with our dogs.

Highly Highly HIGHLY recommend"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Found this gem on yelp and it did not disappoint! Excellent locals spot. Great customer service.  We will be back! Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Spectacular!  Everything we ordered was incredible and the service was outstanding!

We went on a Friday late morning had no wait at all.  But it was pretty full at that hour so I would imagine weekends would have a wait.  There was very little space to sit and wait inside, so I'm glad we didn't get stuck waiting out in the heat :)

First of all, you HAVE to get the pot of bread as your accompanying starch.  Holy crap, it is freaking awesome!  It's a biscuit and a cinnamon roll smashed together and then baked in a coffee cup.  Slather it with some butter and you're in heaven.

I ordered the chicken fried steak, which was a gamble since I'm from Texas and have a pretty high bar.  It was SO good!  Really tender with a delicious coating!  Only complaint is that the coating didn't adhere very well to the steak but that's really just a quibble :)  It came with eggs and cream pepper gravy, yum yum!  I also got one of their smoothies which took forever to come out, but it was really delicious.

My husband order the rib eye chilaquiles and it was just as good as some of the ones we've gotten in Mexico.  We were super impressed!

The decor was a bit hokey but cute.  They have flower umbrellas inverted and hanging from the ceiling.  It helped transform the location from a strip mall to something more inviting.  

Finally, the service was super attentive and prompt.  

Overall, we loved it and highly recommend it!  We definitely will be hitting this up next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday around 1pm and it as packkkkked. 

They served fresh squeezed orange juice.. but for $3.25 for a 6oz cup, I'll pass haha. 

The food here is pretty pricey. The least expensive thing you'll find is the burger that is about $8 or $9. The rest, is $10 and up.

I think I speak for Bun and I, the hash browns were amazing. Thinly sliced potatoes with just the right amount of taste to it. The pot of bread, nomz, cinnamon bread rolled up into a cup -- it's popular and around 1pm, they were also gone!

However, the food, it was meh. And combined paying about $30 for just a brunch, we'll be back but not too frequently. My chicken fried steak, I've had better and would say Egg Works makes it more nomz.

Definitely worth a try if you're in the area but wouldn't be worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"Been to both locations several times and have never had a bad experience here. Ultimate steak and eggs breakfast is a timeless masterpiece. Cup of bread even more delicious than it looks. Wait staff is always polite, and the whole pajama thing is a cute feature that makes me smile everytime I come here. These people know how to have fun and I love having breakfast here whenever I'm in the area. Rise & Shine for life~"}
{"text":"I really came into this restaurant with an open mind. Considering the name of the place (steak and eggs) and being mostly vegetarian/vegan - I already had my doubts... 

However, I gave it a chance because they had promising menu items that just sounded perfect for a late Tuesday morning. 

I'd say Rise N' Shine is average and places itself along side known restaurants like Cracked Egg, IHOP, Original Pancake House or Egg Works in good options. For the price, the plate size accommodates well. 

That being said, value isn't always in the enormous helpings because it should still look and taste great. Rise N Shine fell short here due to the poorly seasoned and lack of flavors, random arrangements of portions on the plate, as well as how underwhelmed you'll feel at nearly $15.00 average per person pricing.  

Let me elaborate... 

The poached eggs for the Benedict was very under cooked which is very unappealing. The red onions were stacked and kept in a ring formation giving you overwhelming bites of red onion which completely takes away from the harmonious flavors of hollandaise, capers and lox. :( 

The oatmeal is served in a deep large white ramekin which to the average adult may be great, because it keeps the bottom lava hot - but for us parents - this is a disaster as you'll spend several minutes cooling off every bite for even the most advanced toddlers. 

The french press in all of its glory was very basic in flavor and could use a better selection of roast to complete the experience. 

Overall this place is so-so for kids and really comes across as your sub-par Saturday or Sunday morning and lunch place - which I'm sure has astronomical wait times, as they usually do. Oh and the wait staff is definitely new and needs some practice with sense of urgency and ability to recall orders and average requests from one table to the next. 

Largest negative takeaways from that $$ classification will be the lack of parking in this ALWAYS busy location as well as price over value over satisfaction ratio that just isn't hitting high numbers right now. 

For the heavy meat eaters or 1200+ calorie seekers, might be most suitable. But for those consciously healthy folks, or parents with large families, you'll find challenges. Solid 3 at best."}
{"text":"Stopped here on my way back to Phoenix. This place was delicious!! I ordered the avo everything bagel with hash browns. Yum!! It was so big and filling and tasted amazing. I will stop here every time I'm in town now"}
{"text":"I had the chicken and waffles....chicken beast without the bone, juicy lightly crisp.
Waffle hot off the griddle, served with chicken on top of the waffle and sprinkles 
Of powdered sugar. I liked the way the syrup is served......warm in a bottle of cinnamon sticks:)"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go eat at this place for a long time, so I was ecstatic when my sister took me to brunch one morning. After waiting 20 minutes to get our order taken we finally went ahead and got the steak, seemed fitting. 

There were many things wrong with our plate, the steak looked burned but they tasted fine so we didn't send it back. After finishing our meals we headed out and we ended up getting food poisoning!!! It was horrendous. The place let me down. Even after I was told not to go I gave it a chance but was disappointed. I will never go back."}
{"text":"The service was poor we Dist get coffee refill until we asked.
It is on the expensive side. We had pancakes with bacon eggs and a bun in a pit one coffee and it was 19.62.  That is a lot the bun in a pot was small and 1 star to me I saw on yelp the rave and it was a disappointment both in size and taste. 
They use Mott apple juice and pour it in a carafe. The syrup is log cabin I sat in the way back and saw the guy pouring this am.  They do make fresh squeeze orange juice though. 
See my photos.
We won't be back here."}
{"text":"The management is the best advertisement because he is friendly, humorous, and attentive. Another place were listening to someone speak about food with excitement. I love a place that does that, then genuinely seeks out customers opinion. I admire when people refuse to allow themselves to become complacent with a good menu. Besides the gentleman that greeted and seated us, the rest of the staff were also pleasant. 

Today was my birthday and it was a fitting place to celebrate. Although most of the festivities will be tomorrow, this relaxing brunch made my day. When I think of festive eats, I go all out. I had ordered the chicken and waffle. When I first cut into the waffle, I was a bit disappointed. It lacked the crunch that I normally love, but after thinking it over, I can understand why they lean towards this style. The chicken is moist, crispy and seasoned to perfection. Having a more cake like waffle gives contrast in texture and soaks up the maple syrup better. You will be dousing your dish in this warm condiment. It is outstanding. The maple syrup alone deserves five stars. The steak and eggs are also delectable. The 8oz cut is marbled well with just enough fat to keep the meat moist and tender. The eggs have a clean flavor that does not need any salt. The potatoes were soft like mashed potatoes on the inside, but had a crunchy outer layer that was nice. Nothing on this plate needed ketchup or steak sauce. We ordered the pot of bread with this meal and it was gone just as soon as it hit the table. The jam was filled with huge chunks of strawberries, but was quite sweet.

Rise and Shine would be perfect if only it offered some lighter fares. On special occasions, like today, I am willing to go crazy on my caloric intake.  Yet a part of my subconscious will not let this go without guilt. I am not even Catholic, so what's with this overbearing feeling? It might be some time before I visit again."}
{"text":"We came here today for breakfast. It was pretty busy. We waited about 25 minute before we got seated. I got the ham and eggs Benedict. I liked everything except the ham it was pretty salty. Our server was nice but slow. Would come back if in the area."}
{"text":"Get the pot of bread, it's delicious!  Chicken and waffles are amazing.  My son loves the pancakes.   Come early or there will be a long wait."}
{"text":"What a CUTE little breakfast spot in a suburban area right outside of the Strip. 

Here are some fun things to know about Rise & Shine:
1. All the waiters/waitresses are dressed in their PJ's (lucky them!).
2. Their menu is quite extensive but not to the point where it's an encyclopedia.
3. Order the chicken and waffles (it's what they're known for).
4. The Red Velvet Chocolate Chip pancakes were the best I've had and their maple syrup is legit, and legit meaning it's not some cheapy syrup straight out of a plastic bottle.
5. Service is friendly and efficient here. They are very accommodating.
6. While you're enjoying your meal, look up at the ceiling and admire the fun umbrellas turned into flowers just spinning about. Felt like I was Alice in Wonderland. :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday morning and we were seated right away. We ordered plain bagel and their ribeye steak and eggs. My steak was perfectly cooked! I ordered medium rare and as much as the meat is not that thick, it was still cooked how I wanted  will be coming back to this place and will be trying their chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"Really cute place but it's a little small. We waited about 25 minutes for a table. The waiters wear pajamas which is kinda cool. I will come back when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great steak eggs  combo with egg whites nice decor friendly staff as well I'll be back soon !! The spot!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Everything I expected and more the service is fabulous and the food is better! Definitely recommended"}
{"text":"After my last review where I gave them 3 stars based on my experience NOT FOOD which was so yummy, I felt compelled to update my review on this place. A manager from the restaurant contacted me via email and they were truly concerned and apologetic about the service I received. That to me says a lot about the integrity of a business. They truly care not only about delivering a superb product, but making sure that every customers experience is equally as superb! They definitely deserve 5 stars!! The food is excellent and there customer service is top notch and genuine. Anyone who has not eaten there definitely should, they are awesome and deserve your business and it is the best breakfast place in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"One of our absolute favorite places to get breakfast. We always split the French toast with the eggs and bacon on the inside. And with the fresh squeezed orange juice? Hands down a place you have to check out."}
{"text":"This place has such great options for everyone. I love the decor since it's not your regular breakfast spot and the service is excellent. We have been here twice and have both tried different things and everything has tasted great. Their cup o bread is a must try it's so good it'll leave you asking for seconds. Try this place you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"By far and away my favorite breakfast place. We eat at the one in Southern Highlands. Today they weren't up to their normal standards. They were out of tortillas, a bit frustrating but ok. The pot of bread was way over cooked, to the point it was rock hard on the top. The eggs were under cooked. We had to ask for silverware and syrup. They were just a little off with everything, not sure if the owner is focusing on his other restaurant, or just an off day. We won't give up on this location. Yet:)"}
{"text":"I don't even want to write a long review for this place. They made us wait a pretty damn long time just to \"create\" a wait time when clearly, there were many open tables.

Food is eh. Bacon wrapped sirloin? Sounds good right? WAY overcooked and disappointing."}
{"text":"This place was great. I ordered their steak and eggs breakfast combo. Their steak alone was 5 stars for sure. However the eggs didn't really have a taste and the hash browns were good...not great. I do recommend this place for their steak, it was incredibly delicious. Staff was great as well."}
{"text":"We had steak chilaquiles, medallion bacon wrapped steak with eggs, 1+2+3 kids breakfast and a side of sour dough toast = $41.00.....wait time was about 10 min on a Sunday afternoon (no bad).  Pretty good breakfast place...clean and decent service.  Ample parking available -- will be back to try something else (prob lunch items and the crock of French onion soup)!"}
{"text":"The ribeye is great. We ate there this morning right when they opened and everything is fresh. The waitress was pleasant and I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Seated immediately but you could tell they had been busy up until we got there.  Three of us, coming back from a hike in Red Rock Canyon, hungry as... One ordered simple scrambled eggs and side of hash browns.  One got the Burrito Olé with chicken and an iced mocha.  I got the egg white and chicken omelet with cup o bread!  The cup o bread was served piping hot immediately.  The iced mocha came with more whipped cream than mocha and was not well received.  Scrambled eggs served dead last, almost as an afterthought and they were stone cold.  We did send them back and quickly got a really hot plate of scrambled eggs!  The omelet was delicious, the burrito's chorizo had a different flavor than we expected but was nice and spicy.  Overall, we'd come back, maybe just to see the servers in their pjs.  The food was actually very good except the tiny missteps of eggs and mocha and that didn't really have anything to do with taste in the long run."}
{"text":"Went on Halloween and the place was very decorated!  Liked the service we received from mini mouse lol. Very nice area, and nice service.."}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer since they opened.  GREAT food and GREAT service.  Up until last week they had great coffee, but sadly changed supplier and brand of coffee. No more coffee for me but it's a personal taste thing... I'm sure people will like the new coffee.   Still a great place to eat."}
{"text":"We are always on the look out for a good breakfast spot. This is located in a very busy strip mall but we had no problem finding parking close. When you walk in your eyes instantly go to the ceiling where they have brightly colored umbrellas with flowers on them opened up and facing downward. Some of them are on spinners. Very cute idea.
The waiters and waitresses are dressed in their pj's. Yet another cute concept!
The menu seemed very healthy. Some gluten-free options, fresh squeezed juices, etc.
They are supposed to be known for their steak and eggs.  I am not a huge fan of steak and eggs so I ordered the Banana Foster flake pancakes with 2 eggs and a banger sausage. Banger sausage...interesting just one came with the meal. It isn't your normal greasy sausage..interesting.. it is actually kind of hard to describe but it was really tasty. Now for the pancakes...delicious. I am not a syrup eater so for me the pancakes were just right. Enough sweetness and the crunch from the corn flakes was perfect...a griddled  banana was on top along with whipped cream and nuts.
My man loves country fried steak and eggs...he said it was really good. It is made with a NY strip steak. He ordered a side of a biscuit and gravy and he said the gravy they used on the biscuit was different than on the steak...it did look different, not as much sausage and thinner. He preferred the gravy on the biscuit. But he said all in all it was a good meal. I had the fresh squeezed watermelon and strawberry juice. Mmmm mmmm mmmm. I am a sucker for anything watermelon though! :)  We hit the restaurant at the perfect time because after we sat the place filled up!!! 
We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I got a breakfast burrito.  They used hash browns, and I prefer sautéed or roasted potatoes. The refried beans tasted like the ones from the grocery store that you get out of a can.  They were extremely busy when I ordered to go, and it took a very long time to get my order."}
{"text":"Pot of bread is yummy could have eaten 3 or 4. Lol
Corned beef hash good. Eggs done perfect. French press coffee highly recommended. Bacon is thick sliced and smoked. Hash brown cut like flat noodles.  Hefty serving of pancakes. Love the casual attire-pjs.  Will come back want to try more."}
{"text":"Such a cute spot for a nice breakfast/brunch! The servers are dressed in jammies and the ceiling is full of upside down umbrellas...I mean come on, how awesome is that? I can't even begin to suggest to you what to order since the menu is full of scrumptious bites. The one thing I do think you should order is the bread in a cup---YES."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's easily my favorite breakfast place in town.

The service is always good. The fact that everyone is wearing pajamas gives the place a nice feel. A man who I believe is the owner interacts with customers on a regular basis in a very friendly way.

Now, the food. Admittedly, I haven't had a huge sampling of the menu. The reason for this is that once I tried the fried chicken and waffles, there was really no reason to do much in the way of exploring. The chicken is pounded before it's fried so it fits perfectly on top of the waffle. It also has a nice peppery thing going on. Not only is it delicious but it's more \"convenient\" to eat than chicken and waffles where the chicken still has the bone in it.

Also, they have some kind of English sausages there. Those things are also awesome."}
{"text":"Food was ok but not the best.  I haven't gone there in almost a year and when I paid the bill I realized why I haven't. Almost $2.50 for a glass of OJ and they don't give free refills. Again, food was ok but there is definitely better."}
{"text":"The breakfast was pretty good and the service was good but the bad part was you can see the cooks and one of the cooks went from playing on his phone at the cash register to going to prepare someone's food and touching a waffle with his bare hands without washing them. That was very unappealing. Later he went back to playing on his phone again I never saw him once wash his hands after he handled people's food.. Won't be coming back to this place just because of that.."}
{"text":"love the food here and happy Henderson has a Rise and shine . I used to live in Southern highlands and went to the one there. Maria is our server and she is very pleasant"}
{"text":"I love this place! My boyfriend isn't as big of a breakfast food fan as I am, but when I told him this place is known for their steak and eggs, we knew we had to come.

There was a wait when we came on a Sunday morning. They said it would take approximately 45-50 minutes. It was 100+ degrees that day, so we killed some time at the smoothie shop next door.

When we sat down, I realized that the servers were all wearing pajamas. I love that concept!

In terms of the food we went crazy tried:
1. Crispy fried chicken breast and waffle
Dark meat is generally better than white meat. However, this fried chicken breast was the best I have ever tried. The breast is absolutely moist, and the outside is super crispy. The waffle was amazing, too. It's perfectly crispy on the outside, and it's the perfect medium between sweet and savory. I love the cinnamon maple syrup, which also comes with the pot of bread, and is served heated.
2. Bacon wrapped tender steak
My boyfriend got this with hash browns. It was good, but not the best. The bacon was overwhelmed the steak. I think next time he'll probably just order the ultimate steak and egg breakfast or the chicken fried NY steak.
3. Pot of bread
For both of our entrees we ordered the pot of bread. It came with jam, butter, and a warm cinnamon maple syrup. It was basically a cinnamon roll, but I loved how they came freshly baked.
4. Side of corned beef hash
The hash browns, while good, are 100 times better with the corned beef hash, which is one of the best corned beef hash breakfasts I have tried. It's salty, but not too much. 
5. Side of country sausage gravy
I typically order gravy with my chicken and waffles, so I had to try their country sausage gravy. It's good, but not necessary because the chicken and waffles is so amazing themselves.

It's my favorite breakfast place in Vegas, and probably better than most of the places I go to in the South Bay."}
{"text":"So happy that we have a breakfast place walking distance from home!  I have to say that I was a bit taken aback by the prices.  Almost $20 for a simple omelette meal, coffee and 20% tip.  However,  the omelette was tasty as well as the hash browns.   I ordered the cup of bread and my server noticed that it looked a bit overcooked.   She had me try it and then brought me a much better one after agreeing it was not good.  Very attentive service and quick to get my meal."}
{"text":"Great food. I ordered the chicken egg white omelette and had it delivered through uber eats.They included a cinnamon roll with a sweet sauce which was really good."}
{"text":"We've lived down the street from here for three years now and finally decided to have breakfast here. I don't know why we waited so long! We came early enough, so there was no large crowd. We were greeted by our server Krys who was nice enough to go over the menu with us and she recommended the Country fried steak and the Red Velvet pancakes. First off, the pancakes were so good. Light and super savory. It was like eating cake. Cake that had an awesome cream cheese syrup! 

Krys also mentioned that the Country Fried Steak was life changing, she was right! The Country Fried Steak is the best I've ever had hands down! I'm a big fan of Cracker Barrel and Rise and Shine just blew it out of the water! The steak was so tender with a light coat of breading that has a hint of spice. My wife had order envy and vowed to get it next time. Next time may be coming up very soon! Excellent breakfast spot in Southern Highlands that has a nice warming atmosphere with a great staff that truly love being there. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for breakfast! Had the cinnamon toast french toast.. To die for! Idk why it has taken someone this long to create that! Can't wait to go try some more!"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was great! 
We enjoyed all of our dishes we ordered. Great Nieghbor hood spot. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Oh my! This is my new go to weekend breakfast spot. Staff are all so friendly and I love that the servers wear pajamas for their uniform! So cute. I've noticed some reviews say that service is slow but I haven't noticed that at all. Indoor and outdoor seating. Lots of options on the menu. All of their juices are made fresh.I usually start with the green go juice. Portion sizes are big, at least for me. So far I've had veggie eggs benny, chilaquiles, veggie bagel sandwich (huge!) and good ole steak and eggs. Loved them all. Just writing this review has me craving the place."}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall in a shopping center.  My expectations were well exceeded.  I am picky about my omelettes, but theirs was perfect.  And the hash browns did not taste like the frozen stuff out of the bag either.  The coffee was great quality, strong.  Loved the bread pot..tasted like a cinnamon roll...and we couldn't help try the red velvet pancakes with cream cheese butter!!  

The ambiance of the place was fun with the waitresses serving food with their pajamas on.  And the umbrellas on the cieling were fun too.  Apparently the owner or manager here is also in charge of the restaurants in Caesar's Palace.  The place is mostly no frills, but they certainly get it right where it counts."}
{"text":"What a cute place!!
I came in during my lunch break. I had looked through the reviews before hand and the chilaquiles (I totally had to google spell check that) looked delicious! So I tried those, they were a little more like nachos but with the overeasy eggs on top, holy cow that was good! I need to go back and try the steak soon."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast spot.  No joke, it literally blows all others that even attempt to serve breakfast out of the water.  The best part is, I don't have to wait forever to get a table like those dumb suckers that wait for an hour at Babycakes for crappy food.  Every time I have been there, on a weekend, I have always gotten a table very quickly.

The reason why I love this spot is that they have totally focused only on breakfast, and with a carefully crafted menu, in executing it flawlessly.  You can tell with every dish, that much thought went into how to prepare it.  And the waitresses in pajamas, how awesome is that?     I really appreciate the love that went into this place, so much that I want to give the owner a hug.

The first time we went, my husband ordered the steak and eggs.  While this is not kobe beef steak, it is cooked extraordinarily well, especially for a breakfast joint.  The steak is juicy and flavorful and contrasts perfectly with the eggs.  He has also ordered the chicken fried steak and while that was extremely heavy, he loved it and said it was the best he's had since he was a kid in Montana, where apparently that type of dish is extremely common.

I have tried the chicken and waffles and a veggie omelet.  The chicken, just like the steak, was cooked perfectly.  And even more impressive than the steak, they managed to keep the chicken completely juicy, warm, and flavorful.  But the waffles were even better.  They were completely soft and almost pancake-like, and extremely fluffy.  I normally don't like waffles because they tend to be so heavy, but they managed to capture the flavor of waffles in a way that did not make me want to sleep for the next 10 days.  They also were topped with a cinnamon maple syrup which was totally memorable.

So if you are looking for the best breakfast in Las Vegas, look no further than Rise & Shine.  They may not be open the entire day, and their menu may be limited in scope, but what they do they do extremely well, and every time I go I am even more impressed with their consistent quality of food and service."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch after visiting the strip, however the good ratings does not match up to my experience. We waited for 30 minutes and there were many empty seats outside we could have sat to eat but we didn't get called in until 15-20 more minutes. I ordered the chilaquiles and the sunny-side egg white was uncooked. They said they would bring me another one but they brought a fried egg on top of the plate I was eating from. Really?? The manager comes and says \"Oh it might have been the special butter we use that makes the egg look clear..\" So he finally brings me a new one when we have to leave and the chilaquiles this time was so salty. 

The waiter shirts also beg for more yelp reviews."}
{"text":"I was surprised that there wasn't a waiting list to get in today... They usually do... Guess it was my my lucky day because my brother and I got seated right away.  Our server was Chris and she was really awesome and attentive.... We got our freshly squeezed orange juice, hot chocolate and water within minutes... The menu is huge! So many great breakfast choices to choose from. I felt like I wanted to order a few dishes just for myself but I opted for the bone in ham steak with hash browns, scrambled eggs and a pot of bread (which is my favorite)! My brother got fried chicken and waffles...  Every thing was delicious! I couldn't eat the rest of my ham so I took it home.

Customer Service at Rise n Shine was AWESOME!!! Thank you to our server Chris who was very sweet! I always enjoy coming to this place!"}
{"text":"This was literally one of the best breakfast places I've had in a long time!! My brother took met for my birthday and wow..We went HAM!! Had the crunchy cinnamon french toast, which was ridiculous!! Then the chicken and waffles, Spectacular!! Then the burrito, I don't even know what it was called, but it was super tasty!! I think that was a good 15lbs of greatness added to my buns hahaha!"}
{"text":"Food was great had the steak, eggs, hash brown, and cup of bread (cinnamon roll in a cup), with a glass of the green juice. I enjoyed my food, however my server was slow and kept forgetting stuff like how I wanted my steak and my cinnamon roll which is included in the meal. The place was not even packed.. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles which he felt wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Rise and Shine people....there is a new breakfast place in town!

We arrived late for breakfast here a couple weeks back and had such a great time! The place itself is very family friendly looking, giggets on the walls and waitresses dressed in pjs. MY FAVORITE!

They had really nice outdoor seating which is where we sat. Our group had already ordered but our waitress took our order promptly and was able to bring it out with our friends. AWESOME!

We shared the corn beef hash and scrambled eggs but shared everyone elses food too. The food was good....not amazing...not to die for....but definitively worth our drive. Everything tasted good. I particularly liked the pancakes. Yum!

Overall a great sunrise stop to fill your bellies before starting your day. Good service, good food and good prices. You should not leave unsatisfied. 

Rise and Shine....I sure did after eating my breakfast. YUM!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good with fair prices. I refuse to pay dinner prices for breakfast food."}
{"text":"Bring your appetite.... because they're passing out Big portions! 

The setup is nice, quiet (during early hours), and cozy.  The waitresses are wearing pajamas which goes perfectly with the atmosphere.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We really like this place and are super impressed with the service and have always had good food! The prices are a little bit high in my opinion for breakfast but the service and the quality of food makes up for the difference.

Updated 
It will definitely be a season before we try this place again. I went in today on Mother's Day and we knew it would be crowded and we allotted for that we're sitting at a table right next to the cashier and got bumped and pushed by workers and customers the entire time.

The music was so incredibly loud that made it feel like chaos no matter what 

Pancakes where not done , eggs Benedict were practically hard boiled, kids waffle tiny for price and had whip cream which in my opinion should be asked for kids menu items, coffee taste like water ... I know what you're thinking why didn't we talk to a manager... it was so loud and busy and that I didn't even feel like it was worth it to try."}
{"text":"I always love trying new places for breakfast in Vegas before the ride back to Cali and I definitely made the right choice in stopping by here. Very friendly staff and super cute that they wear pjs as their work attire.

I ordered the Rise & Shine Chilaquiles and by the pics on Yelp, it seriously did not look like it'd be such a large serving. It could probably feed at least 2 adults in my opinion and for only 10 bucks. I loved how much cheddar cheese it had. I wish it had a bit more beans though. The flavor of the chili was very different from what I'm used to. Sorta had a Tex Mex type flavor."}
{"text":"This is a really good place for breakfast brunch. It gets busy in the morning and they don't take reservations so make sure to get there early. 

We went around 9:40am and waited twenty minutes for a table. 

I came for steak and eggs so that is what I ordered. They have a little spin to it. They put steak and poached egg on a bagel like an eggs Benedict. This was creative and so delicious. It was called NY steak, spinach and Benedict bagel. This also comes with a pot of bread that everyone on yelp was raving about. Unfortunately, they were already out of this pot of bread so they gave a choice of bread for toast instead. I still would like to see what this pot of bread tastes like. :( 

My sister got the red velvet pancakes. She stated that they were really rich. 

Another one of my sisters got the Fancy Steakhouse Omelet. She claims this was delicious. 

One more of my other sisters got the Three Little Pigs Two Fisted Bagel and Egg Sandwich. She said it was good but she didn't enjoy the sausage. 

Lastly, service here was excellent. I didn't catch our servers name but she was really friendly and she seemed to really enjoy her time. All the servers wear pajamas. Maybe it's due to the comfort of the uniform or the people she works with, but either way, she seemed to have gotten up on the right side of the bed. :)"}
{"text":"You can find Rise and Shizzle tucked in the Southwest corner of the Southern Highlands shopping center.  Other nearby eateries is Barcelona Tapas and Off the Strip.  R&S is just another addition to the ever expanding Highlands area.

You will notice the warm and friendly staff from the outset.  Its hard not to see that they are struttin' around in their PJ's, no it ain't no Loberace show, but equally thrilling..j/k.  I love theme based restaurants, Anime Ramen takes the cake though.

Anyhow, I got a kids meal steak and eggs while my patnah got the chicken fried steak.  I wasn't starvin' Marvin, but needed to get something in my stomach, pronto.  It was 10ish, so decided to keep it small.  Its still a nice portion if you ask me.

The steak was done as requested, medium rare, with fresh made hash browns served on a hot skillet.  I threw in a cup of French onion soup for good measure.  The steak was not overly seasoned which I prefer to get that true steak flavor.  The soup was piping hot and came in a stoneware cup.  Its hard to find good FOS, and this place doesn't disappoint.  Not the best I ever had like Drake kinda good, but not bad at all.

Most of the other dishes are pretty generous, unfortunately, the prices aren't.  I would suggest sharing if you are not a breakfast gorger like most of us.  The prep and way the food is served is legit though.  I like how the menu is simply one page, but it can get difficult to find certain dishes.  

The ambiance is nice and quiet and spacious as well.  The inside is decorated like most new and clean breakfast joints are, yet, the twist, literally, is the ceiling fans are fitted with decorative umbrellas that accent the ceiling along with other festive colors.  Looks like Steve Wynn designed it considering the loud colors...lol.  A nice touch nonetheless.

To me, rise and shine is a hit and if you are in the neighborhood, or don't want to venture off to far if you live close by, like me, this place is as good as it gets.  Break that fast at Rise and Shine!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good.  Wanted to find a place away from the strip.  Get the pot bread!"}
{"text":"Ashley is the greatest waitress of all time! This place is pretty amazing! Since this WAS a steak and egg place my boyfriend and I ordered the country fried steak and egg. It came with hash browns, which are probably the best hash browns I have ever tasted in my life. They gravy that came with the steak also worked both as a dipping for the hash brown and steak. I also ordered the Nutella latte, which you will not go wrong with. I saw this place through my friend's Snapchat, and decided to try it out. Best decision I made."}
{"text":"Thank you to Laurel for taking excellent care of us again. Tried the steak omelette and it was perfectly cooked, steak seasoned great and biscuit was probably one of the best I've had. If you can, go on a weekday, when it is more mellow. Love how everything comes to the table quick and fresh. Definitely a great way to start the day!"}
{"text":"Always on point. Food A+ Service A+. Love having an amazing breakfast place near me. My favorite meal!!"}
{"text":"Wtf? Couldn't get through to this place for 20 minutes to order take out. Once they finally picked up Keomi picked up the phone and put me on hold for 10 minutes. I could hear the phone laying on the hostess stand as they socialized. When I called back to speak to a manager I was a denied to. Reluctantly I made my order because this place's food is still great but they get 3 stars for service. Not ordering take out again."}
{"text":"I'm giving this two stars because the toast is good. The only constant about this place is the inconsistency of the food. The only people giving this the rating over two stars are either too lazy to cook or don't know how to cook. 

We live in the neighborhood and have been frequenting this place for over a year now. First and foremost, I dare you to try and get an order of eggs over medium! It can't happen. Either the staff doesn't listen or the cooks just can't cook. On our last two and final visits, the steak on both occasions was cross contaminated with some sort of fish product, perhaps salmon or lox I don't know,  and tasted like a salt lick and if you're not familiar with that it's for farm animals. 

On our very last visit I order the loco moco special. The hamburger patty was so undercooked it was completely raw and I don't know that i will ever be able to eat hamburger again. The eggs were so undercooked they were runny after being asked for over medium, which has happened time after time. Eating here has turned into a bad experience. Not to mention our breakfast was over $44 for two people; steak and eggs and loco moco. It's absurd. We don't intend to ever go back.

The reality is if an IHOP or dennys opened up in the neighborhood this place would be out of business in a week."}
{"text":"Upon first walking in, you are greeted by an Instagram-able paradise. The decor is so cute, so naturally we all had to boomerang the spinning umbrellas on the ceiling :) We had to wait about 10 minutes even though they said 20, which was nice. 

It was really hard to decide what to get as everything sounded SO GOOD. My friend and I got the steak & eggs and it was truly one of the best breakfast joint steaks I've had. My sister got the red velvet pancakes, and they were to die for. Pretty sure I ate half of her plate!

My only complaint was the strange service we received. Example: I ordered salsa, but it somehow ended up with my sister's side of eggs. When I asked if I could get a fresh cup of salsa, they said \"Oops, here you go\" and took it off my sister's plate and put it on to mine. Then my friend asked for a side of butter for her waffles. The waitress looks at the cup of butter on my other friend's plate and says \"but there's already butter here.\" So...we were supposed to share butter off each other's plates? This was a weird thing to say instead of just grabbing us a fresh cup of butter. 

I'm hoping those were isolated incidents, so I wouldn't let it deter you from going there."}
{"text":"You walk in and think \"Old Navy Commercial meets Mrs Buttersworth\" but that's not necessarily bad. So you sit down and see the waitress' in pajamas-and you can't help but smile as even they are almost apologetic about the uniforms. But seriously if I could get my entire family to dress that way for breakfast I would! The menu is large and has a wide variety of items, the pop up breads in cute little pots caught my eye, when asked about them, the waitress was shocked I hadn't tried them and rushed one over to the table! It was scrumptious-as was everything else we tried!! My friend had the chicken and waffles-as I write this from my Atlanta based home-I must say it beat Gladys Knight  with an egg beater! I stuck to the basics and had pancakes, potatoes and bacon yummy! A few days later I brought my 3 year old back-and he had the steak and eggs (yes they have steak and eggs on the children's menu) and it was heaven! I love this place! And as a new vacation home owner in Southern Highlands I will be there often."}
{"text":"New favorite breakfast place!! Food: amazing. From the steak & eggs to the corned beef. Do not miss the cup of bread. So good it should be illegal. Our server Maria was spot on at every turn. Will definitely ask for her next time and every time. Better hurry, this hidden gem won't be a secret for long."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we absolutely enjoyed every bite!  Mikee was the best waiter and took excellent care of us. You must try the \"Cup of Bread\". It was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Our server was great! The wait was supposed to be a half hour; the wait was 15 minutes until we were seated. That was a pleasant surprise! The girls at the front were lovely as well. Unfortunately, that is where it all the positive points end for me. I was given a napkin with a fork and knife rolled inside, which is standard for most breakfast spots. When I picked the bundle up to unroll it I SEE AN OBVIOUS SMEAR OF BLOOD ACROSS THE NAPKIN!!! I quietly alert our waitress and she says \"OHH!! OPPS!! WOW!! Let me take that.\" She brought me a new set and nothing else was said or mentioned again. No manager, shift supervisor, janitor - ZERO. Blood on a napkin served to a patron is pretty serious if I remember correctly, like a health code violation serious. I try to move on with my meal, I personally only ordered a yogurt parfait. When it arrives I notice it was made upside-down. Yes, that sounds silly and petty but when you have a slender glass making it upside-down gives you about 1 or 2 strawberries max and 3 thin slices of a banana. Then the entire thing was soaked in honey (my fault, I should have asked for that on the side.). We also ordered an egg white omelette. They didn't make it with egg whites. The pancakes were overly sweet, like they added something to the batter. BUT... The juices and little cinnamon rolls were delicious. Sadly, the negatives FAR outweighed the positives in this experience. Bummer."}
{"text":"Large breakfast menu so many great choices. You don't have to worry about leaving hungry the portions are very generous. The customer service is so friendly and very welcoming what a great way to start your day. Prices are very reasonable. There's no pressure to rush either like most breakfast restaurants. Look forward to coming back . Get the orange juice for sure fresh squeezed"}
{"text":"Wow, everything was so delicious! 

We got a short stack of pancakes with eggs and sausage, biscuits & gravy, chicken and waffles, and a pot of bread. 

The yelp reviews all mention the pot of bread and honesty it was the most underwhelming thing we were served. 

The biscuits and gravy were easily the most delicious we have ever eaten! Try them. 

I have a mild allergy to eggs so breakfast places are always a hard place for me to try but when I saw the chicken & waffles on the menu I knew that I could check rise & shine out!  They were absolutely delicious. The chicken was crispy and everything you'd want in a piece of fried chicken. The waffle with the infused cinnamon syrup was out of this world yummy. 

My husband loved his pancakes. I did take a bite and they were nice and fluffy and the cinnamon syrup just adds an extra layer of flavor to make them that much more delicious. 

Service was great, wait was about 15 min on a Sunday morning at 10:30."}
{"text":"* The restaurant had a very friendly vibe and VERY aesthetically pleasing. It had flower umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. It's so cute. And the workers are dressed in their cute little pajamas. 

* This is my first time at Rise & Shine, so I've only tried the Steak and eggs. Although, for the only thing I've tried, it's given me a great first impression. I accidentally said the wrong cooking temperature for the steak, so that's my fault. But the flavor was still great and savory. The hash browns were probably my favorite. It had so much flavor and little crunchy bits that I love so much. 

* The price, I believe, was around $15. A little high on the price, but for steak, I guess it's acceptable. 

* Would I go again? Yeah sure. I think I would want to try their other options next time, but it's a great breakfast place to go to. 

* Rate: 8/10
* $$"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I just moved to the area and came across this place and knew he had to try it. We looked up reviews, of course and saw good ones, and the pictures looked amazing. 

Long story short, we came, we ate & i personally expected more. Customer service was on point, our waitress was absolutely amazing and they give a huge portion. The food itself was mediocre, not anything I haven't experienced already. Maybe we'll give it another shot and try something different."}
{"text":"Stop by on the way home from Las Vegas. Everything looked amazing and what we ordered was excellent. Our service from Gilbert was fantastic, he made sure that our experience was pleasant and enjoyable. The food was delicious and very flavorful without being overpowering.  I will definitely be stopping by my next trip through."}
{"text":"Cute room with a bunch of umbrellas hanging from the ceiling and pajammied waitrons.  Good breakfast joints are few and far between in Vegas.  In LA every neighborhood has a cool little local breakfast place.  Vegas has Mimi's Cafe and Hash House a NoNo (aka the worst restaurant on earth).  Blecch.

Anways, the food was hit or miss, mostly hit.  My eggs and potatoes were great, seasoned well, fresh and not greasy.  The chicken fried steak was gnarly, however.  They've got their fryer turned up to high.  It was greasy and overcooked and the breading looked like dogfood.

Overall this place is a 3.5.  We'll round up to 4 for the good service and cool concept..."}
{"text":"Got here around 9am on a Sunday and only had a 10 min wait. Lisa, our waitress was very nice and helpful. We had the Strawberry Belgium waffle and Create your own omelette. The portion sizes were large and the food was delicious. We will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Good food and excellent service. I'll be coming back and try other menus. Will recommend it."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak \"medium\" and it definitely wasn't close to medium.  It was brown (no pink at all).  I can't stand well done meat.  The eggs and hash browns were delicious! The bread in a bowl was incredible as well."}
{"text":"Super cute place! Servers in pajamas, large booths and umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. I also really like the tile on the walls.

I was there on a Monday morning around 11AM there was no wait. This was my first time here, but my friend had been there quite often because he lives right down the street.

He had the french toast with 3 eggs and bacon (apparently he's a growing boy - don't know how he ate it all, PLUS a slice of MY bacon!). I had just the standard breakfast with 2 eggs, hash browns and bacon. We both ordered the \"pot of bread,\" and he ordered an extra for himself (I seriously don't know where he put all this food).

Everything was really good, although I am not a big fan of their style of hash browns. The service was fast and friendly and I will definitely be back because I really want to try one of their signature steak dishes."}
{"text":"I have gone all around Vegas to find \"the place\"  to go and have not only great food but excellent service.  After having great service from the lovely Sharon,  we were blown away by how delicious the food was. We did not expect that high quality of food from a small diner. Can't I give 6 stars? You definitely won two new customers for life! Really recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Horrible. From the price of juice and milk for kids to the moldy grapes that laid on my food and I mean white mold. Disgusting. Lost my appetite. Service is very very slow and there was only 5 tables. For a place that had steak in their name my daughter did not eat her steak and eggs as it was a horrible peace of cheap sirloin. We live a block a way and will never go back again."}
{"text":"We ate here on our last day of our Vegas trip.  We ordered some of the Yelp favorites- disappointments were the pot of bread and the red velvet chocolate chip pancakes.  The pot of bread was tasteless.  And the pancakes were dry.  But we did enjoy the chicken and waffles.  The chicken was crispy and moist.  Overall, cute place with hanging umbrellas and staff wearing pajamas!"}
{"text":"I've been here before when the place was smaller and it was amazing! The service was good and the food was fast and hot.  Today I went and it being a holiday, I expected a wait even with the bigger place,  which was fine.  Once we were seated,  it took our server more than 15 minutes to take our order.  We waited an additional 30 minutes after ordering for us to receive half our food,  calling it was warm would be a stretch.  We watched our server serve multiple other tables in other sections before serving us.  We finally got our toast and it was so cold the butter wouldn't even melt.  This place is a great place if you want to waste an hour and a half of your life waiting for deplorable servers to serve you cold food. Have fun!"}
{"text":"Steak isn't just a steak its rib eye.!
Awesome. Service excellent 
Coffee is pressed 
Pancake red velvet.
Amazing"}
{"text":"This place used to be great.  It has really gone down hill. We waited 15 minutes to get a table and the. And hour and a half for breakfast. 2 hours for breakfast is crazy. The food finally came out and it was cold and terrible.  Won't be going back there anymore."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place and raved about the chicken & waffles so I had to try it.  I was not disappointed. I ordered the chicken & waffles and had to share it with a friend.  My other friend who can ordered the ham steak and it was almost bigger than the plate.  He had to take the ham steak off to get to his potatoes.  WOW! I will definitely be returning and sharing with my friends :)"}
{"text":"Used to have great pancake before I think but now it's way too sweet. Portions are great but I don't think anyone can finish entire plate."}
{"text":"Decided to come check this place out since the other location has such great reviews. 

The wait was about 15 minutes on a Saturday around 10 am. 

I decided to go with the chicken and waffle. I love the breaded chicken but the waffle was just okay. It did taste a lot better with the syrup. My hubby decided to get the steak and egg. He didn't really enjoy it too much. 

We decided to try the cup of bread. The bread was okay but the cream cheese sauce was delish. The sauce over the waffle or french toast would be super yummy. 

Overall, service and food were just okay."}
{"text":"Looking for a small mom and pop shop for breakfast with amazing food come here you need to try their food I come here for the steak and eggs they are so good and their red velvet chocolate chip pancakes a must try item here this is a place to go to for sure."}
{"text":"Skip it... it's horrible. Who puts cayenne pepper in thier chicken fried steak breading!? And then does not list it in the menu. Over priced, under delivered, not a friendly feeling atmosphere."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles?  Yes, please! 
*military discount* 

TL; DR version: Delicious food, quick but spotty service.  

Long version: 
Went on Sunday 12-27-15 around 10am.  
$37.44 got us a chicken & waffle breakfast, an ultimate steak & eggs breakfast, a side of fruit for the boy, an apple juice, a coffee, and an orange juice.  I love the spinning floral umbrellas on the ceiling but they are all dusty.  It looks like they would take them down and clean them! It's quite distracting....but I liked all the servers wearing pajamas...I thought that was really cute.  

THE ULTIMATE Steak & Egg breakfast comes with a ribeye steak, two eggs however you want them, hashbrowns, and your choice of bread.  My husband ate this and complained that none of it was seasoned properly, although the bites I had were delicious and my boy enjoyed the eggs a lot.  He ordered pot o' bread as his bread choice and it didn't show up until we reminded our server.  We were done eating but it was fine because it was kind of like a dessert LOL   

Crispy Fried Chicken Breast and Waffle was really good.  I never thought I'd say this about chicken but the chicken was....fluffy....it was crispy and light and airy and wonderful although it was terribly bland.  The waffle was crispy and delicious and I loved that their syrup is served warm.  I ate every single bite of this breakfast but did not leave feeling like I hate myself, which is always a good sign that the portions are properly sized.  Pro tip....pour a little cholula on your plate and dip the chicken in it!  Give that chicken some flavor! 

I asked for a side of fruit for my boy ($1.95) and the waitress asked if I wanted the honeydew/canteloupe/pineapple mix or the blueberry/banana/strawberry mix and we picked the latter.  What was delivered was just bananas and strawberries so either they ran out or forgot the blueberries. 

Solid breakfast place!  It is 30 minutes from my house and not worth the trip back but I thoroughly enjoyed this breakfast."}
{"text":"Having been here before we expected a MUCH better experience: both our eggs were almost cold, my steak almost inedibly overdone despite me asking for medium, coffee lukewarm. With so many other good breakfast choices around the Vegas Valley, there's no reason to \"experiment\" with this place again (once you've seen the interior and that some of the staff wears pajamas, the show is over and it's just a higher priced steak and eggs restaurant...)...bummer!"}
{"text":"Our first time here. The service was good. My husband had the Chicken and Waffle. It was delicious. I ordered a omelet with Swiss, turkey kielbasa and onions. It was also delicious. Both of our plates came with the Pot of bread. It was a very cute idea came with butter and cinnamon cream cheese. The bread had cinnamon swirled inside.  FYI, the coffee is on the strong side. They also had cute umbrella lights hanging from ceiling that were different flower designs. This place is quite pricey when you take into consideration that there are many great local spots nearby that are about $3 less per plate. Their normal eggs/meat/potatoes and bread plate was $10. Not somewhere we will frequent, but if we have a craving for Chicken and Waffles, this is the place."}
{"text":"My family and I were on a weekend vacation and wanted to try a good breakfast place- thank goodness for Yelp!!! This place is hands down the best breakfast place ever!!! Great service, great atmosphere, and most of all awesome food!! 
I Love the \"pot of bread\" and the \"Chilichilles and Steak\" - are you kidding me?? This dish rocked! Also, the country fried steak and gravy was so tasty- this place has something for every breakfast taste- and our server was awesome! Come early or you will wait a bit!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! Great atmosphere, and lucky enough for my girlfriend and I, it is right across the street. That means we will be frequent customers. Excellent service as soon as you walk in . The parfait was amazing, perfect for 2 people to share. Chicken and waffles was to die for, and the pot of bread was just the finishing touch! Definitely recommend this place to anybody who loves a good breakfast!"}
{"text":"Took my Mom here for breakfast about a week ago. We shared French Toast and I added eggs and bacon. The French toast was absolutely delicious, the eggs cooked perfectly (over medium) and bacon was tasty - but limp and not crispy at all. Our food came super fast, along with the food came our check and a partial refill of my coffee that was still 2/3 full. The server never came back after that, and we sat there for at least 20 more minutes. I would've liked at least one refill of my coffee, and I kept thinking she'd come back - but never did. I hate it when they bring your check with your food, how do they know you wouldn't like something else? The guy at the counter we paid the bill to was really friendly, I expected him to ask how everything was - but he didn't. Oh well. The food was good, so I'd like to give them 4 stars, but the service left a lot to be desired. It could have been a fluke, but I'm just not sure I was blown away enough to give them another chance. There are too many other great breakfast places around to choose from."}
{"text":"I was right!!   I had the chicken and waffle and it was delicious!   Savory chicken, with light breading.  I'm not a fan of thick breading or greasy chicken and theirs had neither of those qualities!  The potted bread was scrumptious.  Sorry I didn't take pics, but I was so hungry, I ate it all!!"}
{"text":"Okay first off I am not a huge fan of breakfast foods in general.  My best friend loves it. So when a few of my friends wanted to go here for breakfast one day I was not looking forward to it. When we walked into the place it was fairly busy not overly packed. The first thing I noticed as the decor which was bright and fun with these cute umbrella flower rotating art hanging from the ceiling. It did make me feel a bit happy to be there. The next thing i noticed is the wait staff were in PJs. All and all the environment was welcoming and a cute experience.

Next the menu was full of options and i was told by my champions that all the food was good. I stepped out on a limb and ordered some breakfast items. I had a waffle, bacon, hash browns, and the potted bread. It was a lot of food but boy was it tasty. I couldn't finish it all but i enjoyed trying. The syrup is real maple syrup that is brought to the table hot with cinnamon sticks in side. The next good thing is i  tasted some of my friends corn beef hash, regular pancakes, and red velvet pancakes.  (another reason why i probably couldn't finish my food.)  Boy everything was a delight. Party for the taste buds.

Now i live in the area and highly recommend the place. If you really like breakfast foods you may fall in love with the place. If you are like me and you would pass on breakfast foods you will not be disappointed eating here. Its worth the trip if you are out and about and are in the mood for breakfast or lunch. (They are not open for dinner).  Make a day of it."}
{"text":"I've been to this place when visiting Vegas 2 or 3 times since I initially tried it and I can say I'm happy I gave them another shot. The food and service are great but depending on what time of day (and day of the week) you go, there might be a bit of a wait because it seems to have become a pretty popular place to eat breakfast and brunch!  Once you order, the food comes out in a reasonable amount of time. I really love the eggs Benedict & their orange juice is delicious as well. My biggest complaint is that I don't live in Vegas so I can't try everything on the menu :)"}
{"text":"On your way out of Las Vegas and want a local amazing breakfast spot to frequent?? 

Look no further than Rise and Shine, I prefer the highland area local but they are both amazing. The breakfast is good and clean with a ton of options. 

Friendly and knowledgeable staff always greet you with a morning warm smile and the owner is always running around checking on things or expo'ing the line (restaurant terminology).

My morning fav is the two fisted avo-veggie sandwich, it's so yummy.

Enjoy and leave a review bc the owner definitely checks in with yelp!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I checked this place out for breakfast last weekend. You will immediately notice that it is super fun and cute inside. There are upside down umbrellas and flowers hanging from the ceiling and the waitresses are dressed in pajamas. The entrance is a bit awkward, as you are greeted there and it is also where you pay so it can get a bit congested. We were greeted and seated within a few minutes. 

We quickly decided on food and it was out within no time. My husband indulged in the chicken and waffles. The chicken was cooked perfectly and looked really good. I settled on the Spice Rubbed Rib Eye Steak Chilaquiles. I was envisioning sliced steak on top of my Chiaquiles, as that would be the easiest way to incorporate steak into the dish. Imagine my surprise when I was served an entire steak on the side. However, the steak was a bit fatty and I didn't taste much spice or seasoning. The Chilaquiles were actually pretty good, but there was nothing special or exciting about the flavors. I thought it was a little weird that they served the salsa and sour cream in tiny dishes on the side. I would have liked those to be more incorporated in the dish. But, it was a large portion and I took half of it home. I also chose the Pot of Bread as my side and it was delightful. I loved the look of it when it came to the table. It is a little Terra Cotta pot with a nice fluffy piece of bread rising from it. This was probably the highlight of the meal. The bread had a nice streak of cinnamon flowing through it and was served warm with butter. 

Rise & Shine is good and they do have some unique dishes on the menu, but there is nothing mind blowing or innovative about the flavors."}
{"text":"I would give the food a 5 star but our experience today wasn't the best. First, they told us there would be a 5-10 min wait but I counted at least 5 open tables plus the entire counter which was empty. Then, our waitress Cary (who obviously took her speed pill this morning) asked us for our drink order and before we even look at menu asked if we were ready to order???? (we've been sitting for maybe 1 minute) we told her we weren't ready and she said he'll give us another minute... No kidding! She came back maybe 40 seconds later... This went on through out the whole time we were there. Gave us the check when we were only half way through or meal, etc.  horrible, horrible service. She was not friendly, never asked how we were doing, just kept rushing us. I tipped anyway, only because I know the cooks and the busboy share it.
P.S. the busboy was a new kid... Must be family related because he was SLOWER THAN MOLASSES!!!! No wonder they get behind even with half the tables open. 

Been here many times before but this might just be our last :("}
{"text":"My hubby and I are new residents to the LV area and saw this restaurant while driving around. Glad we came in. Food was excellent and our waitress, Maria, was awesome."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Very broad menu for any breakfast craving. Everything I've had on the 2 times I been there has been amazing. Customer service is amazing as well.Definitely will go there again whenever am in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Don't bother with Cracker Barrel, only 10 min south on Dean Martin turn right on Cactus and this place is on the left. Awesome food! Great friendly service. When you are tired of smoke filled casinos this is the place to go. Have the potted cinnamon role."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner, and my son and I love coming to eat for brunches. He stares at the umbrella, colors with crayons, and eats tons of eggs and bacon. Bonus, you can build your own omelette so I stuff it with veggies. I'm not a big fan of sugary breakfast items, so I can't say anything about those, sorry.

I CAN say that despite the slightly pricey entrees, I still keep coming back. Always joyful service (and their uniforms are PJs!), delicious coffee press, unique dishware, and their hash browns are my favorite. You can try the other breakfast places people usually frequent, but I LOVE Rise and Shine."}
{"text":"Drove all the way from Summerlin to try this place & I was pleasantly surprised. Food was excellent, great service nice clean modern interior. My baby girl loved the swirling flower umbrellas on the ceiling. I would do the drive again to eat here."}
{"text":"I used to love this place! But I got disappointed when I ate here last Sunday. The server was not as friendly as I remember. Seems like he didn't even want to talk to us. Then after a while, I saw him being so nice and talkative and helping the other table explaining almost everything on the menu. While he didn't even let us know that the full order is too big for 2 kids. 

Then the food. I got my usual, chicken and waffle. But got disappointed on how small it was. I would've understand if their price went up. But when the food price went up, I'd expect that it'll still be as big (the quality is still good) the chicken was just half what it used to be. So that was disappointing. I was looking forward to leftovers, but no leftovers since it was small.

I don't think we'll be back for a while."}
{"text":"hello LV Yelpers!
Came here last week for breakfast the morning it poured/flooded.
One of my coworkers love coming here so a group of us made our way through the rain and flooded streets to rise and shine.
I was excited to try their pot of bread from reading all of the reviews. I don't live close to R&S so I really hoped for a good experience.
It was mid morning and they already ran out of pot of bread! really?! :(
I had the corn beef hash with biscuit which was really tasty. My coworker comes here for the steak and eggs.
If you're in the area and looking for breakfast stop by here! I wouldn't drive out of the way for R&S.
Casual dining. No frills."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food! They are opening a new location off 215 and flamingo closer to my house. Yaaaay!"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast and brunch! This was my second weekend in a row dining at this hot spot. Our server Maria was great,  explained the menu which helped us navigate through the many different options offered. Maria also made a few suggestions that turned out to be amazing. I loved the bread in a cup, and the the kids ABC breakfast was perfect for the kids!! Can't wait to dine here again."}
{"text":"Way more than I have ever spent on breakfast without drinks... or any meal without drinks... But food was REALLY good... so if you have lots of money and want really good food.... here u go!"}
{"text":"Nom. I love getting breakfast with the family there. I can always count on consistent and good. Plus the decor and uniforms are fun."}
{"text":"Tried the Tench Press coffee on reommendation and it was so good. The atmosphere is great with a friendly presence.

The service was slow, so don't go if you'really in a rush. Four tables sat after us and received their food before us. 

I had the Steakhouse Omelet. It was very delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly, but a bit cold. It came with a Pot of Bread. The bread, mixed with cinnamon, was cooked in a small flower pot. It was excellent but also a bit cold."}
{"text":"Our first time here today and we were impressed!
The waitresses were very friendly and attentive. The food was at a good temperature. Country Fried New York Steak & Eggs were delish. My husband said that the Homemade Corned Beef Hash & Eggs were the best. 
Over all we loved it and we'll be back soon :)"}
{"text":"Hidden, almost didn't go in.  Was heading towards tropical smooth next door and gave them a chance.  What's inside is amazing compared to out.  Very friendly and open.  Amazing food.  Clean."}
{"text":"Found this place with my girlfriend and although we enjoyed the decor, the customer service and food sucked. As soon as we got seated the waiter seemed as if she was in a rush, but the place was no where near busy. She took our orders, but never let us finish speaking because she kept interrupting us; again feeling \"rushed.\" She gave us our food and asked what else we needed, and she forgot our utensils, in which she basically threw them onto our table; once again, rushing! The prices were way too high for the quality. I ordered a steak and it was not juicy, it was bland when I asked for medium rare. My girlfriend ordered a southern style chicken fried steak and it did not taste like anything. The breading was horrible too. Paid almost $50 for just the two of us. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Yup they do deserve five stars. Where to begin? 

We arrived at about 1 pm on sunday the wait was about twenty minutes. We were greeted by the hostess right away and she was pleasant. She put our names on the list. Now i want to address something some other yelpers here have mentioned and have been upset about, yes there were empty tables when we were wait listed but being in this business i know there is a reason for this and to those who dont know i shall explain. You see it is better to have customers waiting to be seated then waiting at a table for their order to be taken and waiting a long time for food because the kitchen is behind, so the hostess here doesnt over seat the room rapidly so that the servers and kitchen can stay on track. So next time you see this now you know why and can be more forgiving.
Next, we were seated and greeted right away by Cali, she was so friendly, she made great eye contact and had a great smile. We ordered the french press coffee and apple juices. The coffee was AWESOME! so smooth and not bitter so worth the money. Even though it says you get two cups we got about 3 and 1/2. 
Now the food.
My husband ordered the steak and egg breakfast, and i got the ny steak and egg benny on a bagel. Both steaks were cooked to perfection at mid rare. Only thing is my husband did send his eggs back because he likes scrambled well well done, but the cooks were awesome and got his eggs just right.
We also got a yogurt parfait to share and it was soo good! The portions here are big so we got boxes to take home our delicious left overs.
Over all i loved this place from service to food everything was spot on. i definitely recommend this place and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Second time here, second time in heaven! Maria was so attentive and the food is DIVINE. I had the chicken and waffles, and every thing seemed to melt in my mouth! I'll definitely be back to spend a little more time in paradise."}
{"text":"Came here to have breakfast and relax, definitely miss living right down the road from this place but I don't live too far. Hoped there was wifi but there wasn't, but it didn't kill me. Anyways, ordered a cup of coffee, normally I love coffee in the morning but this cup was kind of old, the coffee tasted like it was sitting for awhile but I downed it anyway due to there only being one server. It wasn't too busy, but it was enough to keep one person running around. I ordered the country fried steak and it was good definitely had a zip to it, the eggs weren't over easy but fried...the hashbrowns weren't bad, and of course I'm digging the pot of bread! I hate complaining because I've worked in the food and beverage industry for a long time, so I eat what I eat unless it was raw or cold then I wouldn't. But this was mediocre. It definitely has changed since the first time I was here, so it's kind of disappointing.  They should have put at least one more person on the floor so that someone can always make sure that coffee cups were filled and water cups were filled. 

4 stars were given because besides the food and the service its a beautiful restaurant and it has potential and I hope it's worked on and not forgotten when the new restaurant is built."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast.They have the best hash browns,made with green onions added.Very pleasant staff.This will be our new go to for breakfast.Love that they have a senior menu!Only complaint one of the staff had a T-shirt with their slogan on it,that was not for family to view.Just not a good example for a family restaurant."}
{"text":"This review is based on food alone. 
My fiance and I ordered to-go brunch to enjoy some weekend breakfast in bed, and honestly wished we hadn't.
The medium rare strip steak was cooked blue rare. It was cold and inedible. 
The chips in the chiliaquiles were dried out and burnt at the edges.
Lastly, thee corned beef hash had a wet/soggy texture and very little flavor. 
Essentially the best thing we ordered was toast... for $40 worth of food. Needless to say, we were frustrated."}
{"text":"This place would fit in nicely inside a upscale casino hotel on the Las Vegas strip. Except then, the prices would be 40% higher! Worth the trip out here, even if you are a tourist or visitor. The restaurant is actuall just a couple of minutes off the i-15 at the Silverado Ranch blvd exit.
 
An omelet with steak was almost platter sized, biscuits & gravy was yummy as well. Service was friendly, and the place is very clean. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing!
Great food
Great service!! Ham steak is biggest in the world 
Delicious delicious delicious"}
{"text":"This place has the best breakfast I've had in Vegas so far! The orange juice is freshly squeezed, not diluted at all. There is a lot to choose from too, which I love! My family and I have been here about three times, and more to come!"}
{"text":"Been to this place several times already. Food and service is really good. One thing that disappoints me every time is that they always run out of the \"pot of bread\" which is what they are known for."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazingly good!  I had their steak and eggs and it was cooked to perfection!  Customer service was great and very attentive.  I highly recommend this place for breakfast!   I definitely will come back for more!"}
{"text":"Mother's Day wait was apx 1 hr but we stayed because of the great ratings.. Waitress forgot to put in our order so we ended up waiting 1.5 for our pancakes. Manager made the entire order fresh and turned an unpleasant experience to a great one.  It was their treat for the inconvenience. Loved the pancakes and crunchy French toast. Fresh coffee & great eggs & hash browns.. Loved the food"}
{"text":"... went there at 930 am first time there.  There was one server covering the whole restaurant she forgot my friends coffee for about 20 minutes. Which is fine I know covering a whole restaurant by yourself is not easy. Brought out the food which was bland and way overpriced! I got a bowl of cereal for my daughter it came with yogurt and fruit it was $6 which wouldn't have been so bad if they didn't charge me $3.50 for an apple juice to go with it. All in all spent $40 for 2 people and a baby :/ will not go back."}
{"text":"Very good hidden gem for breakfast! Nice atmosphere and in the heart of Southern Highlands!"}
{"text":"Great service and good food. One of my favorite places to eat breakfast. Welcoming restaurant and great culture."}
{"text":"Our last meal before we headed home from our week long stay in Las Vegas. After a week, we were looking for something other than a buffet. My wife found this place and wow, what a gem it was. It's way south of the Strip, but it's worth the drive. 

Here's the rundown:
French Pressed Coffee - it's a long drive, so I needed a good cup of Joe. What a cup!! First off, they use Illy coffee (Italian espresso coffee bean, my favorite) It comes in a big French press container (good for at least 3+ cups of coffee, good for at least 2 persons) and a sand glass timer to determine how strong you like it (cute touch). Talk about a good start to your meal, if you're a coffee drinker, you've got to try this. Great Coffee. 

Pot of Bread - literally a bread baked in a small terre cotta pot (another cute touch). The top is brushed with cinnamon sugar and is very good. This is one of your bread choices w/ your breakfast meal (other choices are toast or biscuit) pot of bread would be my recommendation. It's unique and a good eats. 

Ultimate Steak & Eggs - 8 oz ribeye steak and two eggs (there is an option for 3 eggs)  with hash brown. My steak was cooked medium rare (as requested). It's on the thin side but was very delicious. 

Crispy Chicken Breast & Waffles - this was my wife's order. But this will be my order next time. OMG. The best chicken & waffles I've ever tasted. Yes, better than Roscoe's C & W. I prefer dark meat, but their crispy chicken breast was incredible. The chicken was indeed very crispy outside, but the breast was so moist and soft inside. Tons of flavor, delicious!!  And the waffle was so so good. Yum yum yum. The best period. A MUST ORDER. 

Service was super friendly and helpful, thanks Lisa! On this day, all the waitresses were dressed in pajamas (yes another cute touch)

Info: they are only open for breakfast & lunch. They close at 3 pm. 

If you're sick of the buffet and want something different and really good, come here. You won't regret it. 

I'm rating this a 5 star plus
I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We ate at this location last summer, loved it. We've since only eaten at the Green Valley location, which is amazing. Coming back to this location yesterday, I was disappointed. My French Toast was crunchy on the edges, soggy elsewhere. My scrambled egg whites were not great, my bacon burnt, and my husband's standard scrambled eggs were stiff. We will definitely be patronizing only Green Valley R&S from now on."}
{"text":"On your way back to LA from Vegas, get away from the city and head into this charmer! They truly know how to do breakfast, and even serve you in full pajamas! This restaurant had the most charm with their open kitchen and umbrella lights hanging from the ceiling. Riley was our server, who was so unbelievably kind and attentive to our half full coffees and waters. She was fast too! 

We ordered up a two egg breakfast with bacon and potatoes ($9) and the corned beef hash and eggs ($10.50) PLUS a short stack of pancakes with warm cinnamon maple syrup. I know it sounds beyond basic, but this is the ultimate American breakfast at its best!  The corned beef was hearty, more on the beef side than the potato and the pancakes were light and fluffy. The bacon was just right, a crunch with a chewy middle. 

This cute restaurant really seems to be a favorite around town and we will definitely stop by again after a weekend in sin city."}
{"text":"We went to this new establishment this morning and Maria was our server.  We ordered Chicken n waffles...it was awesome!  We order cup o bread for appetizers and it didn't disappoint.  Fabulous!!! We have tried several breakfast cafe spots in Henderson ( Eggs Works, Baby Stacks and Metro Diner).  We have found our spot \" hands down\".  The service and food is excellent!  We will be back soon"}
{"text":"Living in the Southern Highlands area there are not many choices for breakfast. I happen to stumble across this restaurant on Yelp and the restaurant had 4 stars. My experience was far from 4 stars. We waited 20 minuets to be seated only to be served by a overwhelmed server and to top it off the restaurant was really warm. I ordered the 3 egg breakfast scrambled with American cheese and sour dough bread. My eggs were greasy and it looked like they stuck a craft single on top of my scrambled eggs (it wasn't even melted all the way when it showed up.) My sour dough bread showed up dry and cold and my bacon was cold and greasy. This was my first and last time at this restaurant. My plate was not worth the $14 I spent on it or the stomach ache I got afterwards."}
{"text":"Neighborhood breakfast place. It's big so we didn't have to wait for the table. Service was very friendly."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of breakfast but this place has me sold on it!!  My very first time giving a breakfast place a 5 stars review! The pots of bread are THE most moist bread I've ever eaten!  The chiliquilies were absolutely delicious with just the right amount of flavor.  My husband has been on the hunt for chicken fried steak for years and he says his hunt is over!  The kids enjoyed the steak and eggs and the 123.  The service is phenomenal and I love what they are wearing!  As of today we will become regulars here!"}
{"text":"Great place a little off the beaten path.  All of the servers are in their pajamas, which is kind of unique.  The red velvet pancakes are decadent and very rich.  I had the steak and eggs which was a nice piece of meat cooked properly.  I'd return!  Excellent coffee as well!"}
{"text":"A few peers and I went here to get lunch in between a college test prep course. We had an hour, so ordered immediately when we got there. The menu looked good, but we ended up not even getting our food. We waited for 50 MINUTES, and finally had to leave so we weren't late to our class. The couple next to us waited 45 minutes for their food, and their order was wrong. We were extremely disappointed, especially in the service. The staff did not care to check on the progress of our order, when we asked continually. Will never go to this location again. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This was a very surprising l good breakfast spot.  The Crunchy Cinmamon French Toast and the Crispy fried Chicken breast were succulent.  The place is full of good energy.  My wife is still licking her lips.  Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Best chilaquiles around!!  Don't get the steak with it though.  Ordered it twice, not cooked well.  Crunch French toast is solid!  

Been here multiple times, will continue to go."}
{"text":"Yummy food!! The staff was great! Portion size was big so come in starving!! I love how the staff wore pajamas everyone looked comfy and all customers seemed happy including me. Our waitress knew the answer to every question we had and her recommendations were spot on."}
{"text":"Breakfast not worth the money expensive I paid 16 dollars for extra gravy shame on you go somewhere else save yourself the heartache"}
{"text":"I love finding new breakfast places and so I was really excited to try Rise & Shine. I was surprised to find how cute and well decorated the inside is!! 

However, I noticed immediately that the service was lacking. Everyone here seldom smiled and seemed like they didn't want to be there... Breakfast places are usually notorious for their overly friendly service but not this one. Our server, Christina, was very insincere and seemed impatient when we were indecisive about what we wanted to order. After our food came out, she didn't come back to check on us once!!

The food is edible. I ordered the corn beef hash which I didn't really consider to be real corned beef hash because it was just beef cut into small pieces. It was hard for me to want to finish.. Also, the bread in a pot that we ordered tasted kind of stale and not fresh like I expected. 

I really wanted to like this place but this restaurant as a whole needs improvement"}
{"text":"The service sucks here. The girl has no personality and she looks like she came to work in her pjs. The food was awful and it sucked. Definitely would not come back or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This used to be good. Even worth the drive.

They raised the price, changed the menu, and took out items that used to be free.

During our numerous prior visits, we would always get the Country Fried Steak and Chicken & Waffles whenever we go. This most recent visit however, we noticed they changed the look of the menu and the price, it was $13 per entree (I believe it used to be around $10), it didn't come with sides anymore. I remember we would always get the side of biscuits to go with the Country Fried Steak and the famous Pot of Bread to go with the Chicken & Waffles. When I asked about it, she said said the portions are so large so you don't need the sides. If we want we could order them as extras.(what the??)

The food quality has gone downhill. We went around 2 pm on a Friday and there were only about 4 tables in there. And our food was over cooked and greasy. 
Very unfortunate. This will not be our brunch place anymore!"}
{"text":"I went here last week for the first time. There were a couple of parties ahead of us but we were seated within 10 minutes of arrival.

The restaurant is clean and spacey. The staff is friendly and definitely acknowledges youe presence. Some of the waiters and waitresses wears pajamas to stick with the rise and shine theme. 

The decor of the place is very appealing as well. They used umbrellas as lamp covers hanging from the ceiling. They also have mosaic art along the walls, making this place very comfortable and homey. They also have an open kitchen, where you can actually see them cooking and preparing meals.

I did not get steak and eggs but I did get the a classic egg, sausage, hash brown platter. Everything was well done, the sausage was juicy. The eggs were perfectly over easy, and the hash browns were crispy and moist in the inside. 

They have a pretty intensive menu full of good food with reasonable pricing!
I will definitely come back here again.

Great job Rise & Shine and staff!"}
{"text":"For the price, the food was just okay. I could have gone somewhere with more selection and better quality food and spent less money. The service was just okay. Waitstaff was friendly, but not good about checking in. The decor was nice--the umbrellas hanging from the ceiling is a nice touch. The a/c was blasting and ice cold. While a/c is obviously appreciated, it's not fun to eat while I'm shivering. While there was nothing terrible about this restaurant, it's too pricy and too far out of our way for us to consider returning."}
{"text":"Very tasty--we have now made a point of stopping here twice on our way out of Las Vegas. Their bacon, eggs, and waffles are delicious."}
{"text":"Went this morning for the very first time. Items ordered:  the ultimate (3 eggs and 8 oz ribeye), and the eggs Benedict. After learning what the \"pot of bread\" was, we ordered one of those as well. We also had the French press coffee. Love, love that they use Illy coffee. So good.

I admit to having been nervous about the eggs Benedict, because they use ham instead of Canadian bacon, and the menu also noted it had balsamic vinegar on it. Don't get me wrong, love balsamic, just never had it on eggs Benedict.

Food arrives. Yum!!  Best eggs Benedict I think I've ever eaten. The ham was very flavorful and tender, and the balsamic drizzle added just a little touch of flavor. 

My hubby's steak tasted great and his eggs were cooked perfectly. 

Hash browns were also very good. Nice potato flavor and not overly crispy. 

The pot of bread was marvelous. It's described as a cross between a cinnamon roll and dinner roll. To the previous reviewer who complained that it tasted \"yeasty\"....um homemade bread is supposed to have a yeasty flavor. 

Decor was nice and loved the servers wearing jammies.  They were all friendly and seemed happy to be there. Only complaint was it felt awfully warm in there, but maybe that was from all the yummy food being prepared. 

Will be back, and definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here during our recent trip to LV.  We had to wait say 15 minutes for seating but it was totally worth it.  Portion sizes were huge. If you leave this place hungry something is wrong with you.  My husband had the steak and eggs  and I had just over easy eggs and some biscuits and gravy.  Before our breakfast we had the pot of bread cinnamon yumminess!  All I can say is who ever thought of that pot of bread is some kind of genius.  We watched the diners to the right IOC us order the breakfast burrito and waffles (1 person) and he ate it all!  When we come back to LV ...and we will come back, this place is definitely on our list of places to revisit.  Staff was super friendly and in the PJ's made it so cool.  Some how we managed to eat it all. We were not leaving one bite of that goodness behind."}
{"text":"Have tried to order from UberEats twice and you guys rejected my order for reasons I am unaware of. If you don't deliver, why are you on the website?? 

Lost my business forever.

Sincerely, 
A very hungry, upset patron."}
{"text":"I love Rise & Shine -- delicious food, fast service, and quick turnaround time.

Came here on Easter Sunday so it was packed af, but the service was still attentive and friendly. As for the food, after trying it on that fateful Easter Sunday, we promptly returned the following week. I cannot praise their signature Cup-O-Bread, Chilaquiles, and orange juice enough.

The Cup-O-Bread is a warm, gooey, sweet cinnamon roll. It's perfection served up in a cute lil' cup.

The Chilaquiles is basically a plate of hearty breakfast nachos and a great vegetarian option. The serving size is so huge, it makes me cry that I can never finish it in one go since I know they won't warm up well. It feels criminal to let something so good go to waste.

Lastly, the orange juice is delicious. Even at the steep price of $4.50 per glass, I highly recommend it (and I'm not even a big fan of juice)! 

Overall, great breakfast option. The staff knows how to hustle plus breakfast is gloriously indulgent, unique, and delicious."}
{"text":"This place was so good we came back a second time while on our trip to Vegas. Highly recommend the French Press coffee! Also you have to get a pot of bread, delish! The atmosphere is cute and comfy. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Super good chicken and waffles and ham eggs Benedict. I always love fresh squeezed OJ. 
I love the ambience, the waiters are in their PJ's. It is a relaxed, fun atmosphere. Their are flowers hanging from the ceiling and cool farm photos on the walls."}
{"text":"I just read that this place closes at 3. Maybe that's why my experience was Meh
Starting with the waffles there was nothing special about them. Dry and basic. I'm not a syrup junkie so taste is important when it comes to my waffles. 
The bacon was super greasy and tad bit chewy. No go on the bacon.
The country fried steak was pretty impressive. HUGE!!! 
I usually hate the gravy but to my surprise it was probably the best I've ever had for my CFS! Heck Yeah! Bring it on!
The Country fried steak was crunchy, well cook and seasoned. 
Bonus for me was that the gravy was on the side. I hate globs of gravy all over my steak. So there it is. Go eat, order CFS, get your gravy on the side and leave the bacon alone..
3 stars/ I'll try again earlier in the day..."}
{"text":"I had never been to Rise and Shine until I went with my co-worker for lunch.... and I am now a HUGE fan! 

Since this was my first time visiting we decided to share two items so that I could try more than one thing.... so we got the Ham-N-Eggs Benedict and the Peanut Butter & Blueberry French Toast, what a great choice to split- we got the savory and sweet! And they were both great choices!

I am definitely a fan of Rise & Shine! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Rise & Shine for our last meal before heading back from our Vegas trip. 

The food is standard breakfast food but it's really good here. I loved the Chicken & Waffle! The chicken was moist and tender and had a really nice crispy texture on the outside. Too bad this was my sister and her husband's dish or else I'd eat the whole thing! The steak & eggs dish was good and came with toast and hash browns. I shared this dish and it was a perfect amount for the two of us. The steak had a nice char but wasn't as juicy as I'd hope. I loved the side of bacon we had. Can't go wrong with bacon!

Service was good but they forgot a couple of items and we had to remind them."}
{"text":"Seriously, I just had to post another review, we went Sunday for breakfast and had another great experience. Let me declare - Bacon wrapped tenderloin rules!!!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome with a great presentation. Not to mention service was super friendly and the place is decorated cute!"}
{"text":"This place has some amazing food! The service is great...we had Maria this last time and she was fantastic.  Cute PJ's too!! Oh yeah, the staff wears pajamas,  love it   my boyfriend and I played giant Connect Four  (I kicked butt) but that's great to have too.  Only complaint is the parking...not so bad in the early am, but when I went for lunch holy moley good luck finding a spot. I'll be coming back again and again and again"}
{"text":"We had to wait a while for our table, yuck...  But the food was top notch.  I had the chicken fried steak and egg breakfast, then skipped lunch!  Yum"}
{"text":"Sometimes I think I shouldn't write reviews about the places I like because I'd rather keep it a secret.  But in these hard times I'd like the places I love to stay busy enough to survive.

Finally a breakfast spot for Southern highlanders.  I'm tired of having to drive miles just for a decent breakfast.

I can't say that I am blown away by the decor or the service.  Heck, there was even a 30 minute wait to get in.  If I were rating on that alone I'd give out an average score of three stars.  The saving grace of this place live behind the counter.  Those cooks are doing a great job and I hope they get paid well.

My girlfriends french toast was the best she's had in Vegas so far.  It didn't even need any syrup on it.  It was just delicious.  

My steak looked like your average steak, but let me tell you, it is hard to find a place that can cook a steak just right.  Normally, you go into a busy restaurant and the steak comes out either over cooked or damn near raw; however, this place was jam packed with people and my steak came out cooked just how I ordered it.  It was even seasoned well.  No A1 required.  I haven't had a steak this good at a restaurant in years!

So go check this place out.  It has all the normal favorites made better then most places you'll eat at."}
{"text":"So I used to absolutely love this place but the last two times we have went, to include this past Saturday morning, the wait for the food was over a half hour. I mentioned it to the young lady who I paid the check with but she didn't really have a good reason as to why we had to wait so long. The waitress didn't even say sorry for the wait. The service is going down hill."}
{"text":"the food is good but they haven't dusted the ceiling for what looks like 2 years. seriously, look at the umbrella lights, they are furry with dust along with everything else up there. 
the pajamas idea is neat but the everything below the knee is filthy, the pants drag on the floor and look horrible. I like this place, but they need to clean it up."}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day. All day everyday. Rise and shine offers something a little different than the typical egg joint. Most meals come with a bread in a cup, basically a delicious tiny warm cinnamon roll ! And they also offer some fresh juice choices like watermelon, which is a refreshing addition along side orange juice. I ordered some child silver dollar pancakes for my daughter and my husband and I ended up eating the majority of them, the flavor was so good. I expected a standard plain pancake but they is a flavoring I can't place in them that made them good by themselves. The portions are also a nice size, enough to eat the whole plate if you very hungry but not too much to feel like a pig (I don't really like left over breakfast food). I'd say the service made me minus a star. It was a little slow and also impersonal; know one looked very happy to be working there, or checked on us during the meal."}
{"text":"Everyone writes reviews of places they love. I've written plenty about how much I love Rise And Shine here in Las Vegas. Well, you learn WAY MORE when things DON'T go perfectly: This Sunday, my wife and I were seated at \"that\" table. Y'know, the mystical spot where ONE waiter thinks it's the other waiter's, and the other one thinks it's the OTHER waiter's. Consequently, we waited 10 minutes with no greeting at all, and watched later arrivals on both sides get attention while we were ignored. Right around the time we were thinking \"Let's get outta here\", the hostess (Shannon) came over, and with true concern told us that she had noticed we had been waiting, and wanted to help. She took our order herself, gave us a 2-for-1 coupon, and brought us our food herself... then she checked back TWICE during our meal to make sure everything was OK, checked us out promptly while mentioning that she recognized my wife and I as \"regulars\", and was extremely pleasant and made friendly conversation, introduced herself and asked our names, and again took great care to apologize for the delay. All I was thinking was \"WOW\". Look, I GOTTA testify, their food is good enough to treat people like dirt and still succeed - the fact that they care so much makes it a NO-BRAINER. I've  trained Customer Service for a living for over 26 years, I know what I'm looking at -  Thank you, Shannon, thank you, Rise And Shine!"}
{"text":"From the flowers hanging from the ceiling, to the wait staff in pjs, to the cutest little pot of bread, everything here is perfect! Haven't had a bad thing on the menu yet! Once you walk in the smell alone will make you want to order everything on the menu! Great breakfast place!"}
{"text":"as a former restaurant owner in phx. i dine out often and like to try new places. the first time i tried this restaurant i ordered the chiliquiles. upon arrival it appeared to be just a plate of slop. the flavor wasnt much better then the appearance. yesterday my friend talked me into going again. looking at the menu it showed a bagel sandwich which looked good. the waitress informed me it was just a picture and i couldnt have it. for goodness sakes it was a bagel with egg bacon and cheese...i ended up with hard eggs greasy hash browns the best part of the meal was the orange slice. wont be going back"}
{"text":"Service is great! Our server was really cheerful and was attentive to our refills of water. My husband had the steak & Chilaquiles with eggs on top & it was on point. I had to eat some of he's Chilaquiles., I had steak & eggs & hash browns, steak was very flavorful and juicy.. Decor is inviting and the ceiling flower umbrellas was adorable!!"}
{"text":"After a rather lackluster first visit to the other Rise & Shine location on Flamingo, it's with disappointment that I note that the original location also failed to rise to the occasion of a great breakfast.

All puns aside, I do really want to like this place. Service is spot on and incredibly friendly, but the food leaves much to be desired for me I'm afraid. I found the fried chicken flavorless and dry, the waffle was a soggy mess and the chilaquiles were as well. The only thing from my meal that I halfway enjoyed were the red velvet chocolate chip pancakes. They were good when paired with the flavorless and over-battered chicken to help make it more palatable. 

Aside from the pancakes, the service was the only other saving grace about this place. I don't see myself making any extra effort to come back when there are much breakfast spots near me that have cheaper prices and better food."}
{"text":"Yelp has not disappointed this Vegas Trip weekend. Heading home from the strip we came upon this place about a mile off the freeway. Usually, I detour when it points me longer than a mile or so, but learning from last time I'm glad we stayed and headed for this place. Had I not I would have ended up at a run down shack in Barstow. 

The place looked lively as we came in. After all how many places do you know where you can come to work in your pj's. We all loved this! Made us get even more into the Christmas spirit. We were seated promptly. Not that I'm a coffee connoisseur or anything, but they serve Lavazza! Smooth good ol Italian coffee. Last place I had Lavazza was in San Francisco. 

Getting into the menu they had a good variety. I had the steak omelette, and the rest had the chicken and waffles and 3 egg omelette. Overall our breakfast arrived timely, was cooked to order, and I can say their hash browns are outstanding. Only complaint was the chicken had a little too much pepper which ended up brushing off on the waffle. Other than that everything else was good. 

In the end it was a great breakfast spot on our way back to CA. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great place friendly cozy :) staff is awesome service is awesome it's close to our house an over easy choice then McDonalds"}
{"text":"When we're in Las Vegas, Rise & Shine - A Steak & Egg Place is my favorite spot to have breakfast!!  It is located quite a distance from the Strip, but it is so worth the drive!!  The staff is wonderful, efficient, helpful, and friendly with everyone dressed in their pajamas.  The interior looks lovely, and what really stands out is all the colorful umbrellas hanging from the ceiling.

The food that I have tried here has been absolutely positively delicious!!  By no means, am I an expert on all their many menu options here.  There are only two meals that I have ever tried here, and I cannot get myself to try some other items.

Crispy Fried Chicken Breast Atop a Waffle is amazing!  The Belgian waffle with the warm cinnamon maple syrup is really good.  The chicken breast that sits on top of that waffle is even better cause it is so tender, moist, and full of flavor!!  Wow!!

Red Velvet Chocolate Chip Pancakes are the BOMB!!!  If you are a sweet tooth like myself, then order this decadent treat!!  It will be like a party in your mouth!!  The combination of the white and milk chocolate chips with the warm cream cheese syrup on top of those fluffy Red Velvet pancakes is like a very very sweet taste of heaven!!!  I can never finish this meal in one sitting because it is so overwhelmingly rich and SWEET!!  Fortunately, the leftovers are almost as good the next day!!  Seriously, get ready for an awesome sugar overload!!

Maybe one day, I will venture to try something else on their menu.  I hear their Steak & eggs are pretty darn incredible as well.  For now, I look forward to my next trip to Sin City so I can get my fill of Rise & Shine's yummy goodness!!"}
{"text":"This place has gotten so much better from the first time I came here! They even have a little fresh juice and espresso machine area now! Usually nothing can compare to Babystacks but this place is giving them a run for their money! Red velvet pancakes we're so perfect, almost cake-ish and crispy ends yum!!!!"}
{"text":"Holy cow, the chicken fried steak & eggs were huge and amazing, the pot of bread was delicious but a little soggy on the bottom, I should have went with the toast to sop up my yolk or maybe both would have been a good idea.  I needed a good steak and egg place to frequent and now I have found it. I will be back!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here since it opened, amazing food and a super whimsical atmosphere gave it a unique bed and breakfast feel/ the other day I came in and it was an hour from closing, hardly any people in there. The service was terrible, the cashier had an attitude,  and the music was deafening and annoying. It felt like the parents had gone out to dinner and the kids had gone rogue. I'm leaving this review in hopes that the owners or management will see it and bring us the great place we were used to.  Keep an eye on these employees, they aren't doing you any favors. Food still great but the ambiance is off. I'll keep trying in hopes that you get back to the 5 star place we loved going to."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, then they changed from their amazing Tillys coffee to something very bitter...yuck love coffee but can't drink that! Second they change from delicious thick bacon to something that taste microwaved...disappointing Time to try somewhere new"}
{"text":"A pretty good breakfast spot. But be warned, this is the ONLY location worth going to. Their Flamingo location really turned me off of this place because my first and only experience was literally the WORST breakfast service in Vegas. 

However, the Southern Highlands location is great! The service is fast and the staff is really kind. The food is really good, too. I'm not a lover of sweets but their cinnamon French toast is to die for. Their eggs Benedict and omelettes also hit the spot in the morning."}
