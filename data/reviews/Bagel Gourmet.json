{"text":"Went here for the first time today and I will most certainly be returning! The bagels are lovely & fresh and the service was polite and friendly."}
{"text":"Not the best service I've ever had. They literally charge extra for EVERYTHING! We wanted to get two drinks. No problem. Getting them \"for here\"? Woah now, don't get crazy. They still put them in \"To go\" cups and then charged extra for the porcelain cup and we had to transfer our drinks. Granted the man did not speak perfect English, so when an American employee was available, I asked her, and she confirmed the ridiculousness. Needless to say, I was a bit peeved to find out that $3 of my purchase went to a stupid mug for 10 minutes.
Not to mention I also saw the woman in the back that was cooking,  eating while doing so. Not sanitary. I've worked in food business and that's not acceptable.

Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Tastes like just bread. Wasn't good at all."}
{"text":"I visited this bagel shop for the first time today. GREAT selection of bagels and tea. Here's my little CAVEAT: The price of one bagel on the big menu on the left wall states $0.92 or $ 0.95 (I don't quite remember.) When I went to pay for it, I had the option of having my bagel toasted with cream cheese; (who would want to have it cold while dining in)? Obviously, the bagel with the added items will cost just  little more. The clerk rang up my order. The total ($4.33) plus tip seemed a bit much for one bagel and hot tea. I asked him: \"How much was the bagel?\" He replied $2.50. 

He then said that the $0.92 was just an a la carte price. I thought, how sneaky. I highly suggest that the shop adds the toasted-bagel-with-cream-cheese price ($2.50) to the big wall menu so that it is obvious to the customers, and not misleading.

Note: I wrote this post in October. Apparently, I didn't submit it completely."}
{"text":"Used a group on here and AMZING!!! Whenever we come from LA, we got to start our day here!!!"}
{"text":"Great bagels! Not the best atmosphere but good coffee and bagels. Fair prices, friendly staff... I will definitely go there more often."}
{"text":"The food and service at this location were average. It also didn't get that busy. Enjoyed that as I had stopped in to get some work done. Will probably be back."}
{"text":"Great Bagels...first time in a long time I had more than one (I'll hike it off later). Clean place, friendly staff, happy to accept my Groupon. REAL bagels with the perfect texture."}
{"text":"If your website says you deliver and I'm within your delivery range and within business hours being short staffed is not an appropriate excuse to not deliver for the day. Bad business."}
{"text":"Very clean and comfy mom and pops bagel shop.
They offer a variety of Bagels, sandwiches and sweets and much more.
My breakfast bagel was delicious.
 when I'm out and about this is the place I'll go too!


Supporting family business helps everyone plus to have the experience of different places , they all are unique in their own way"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Their bagels are incredibly yummy, and fresh. My friend, who was born and raised in NY, told me that these are the best bagels she's had since leaving there.  I often buy a dozen to take home, and freeze them. When I want one, I toast them and they're just as good."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years! I love it, and they will make anything to order. Great service, free wifi, fresh food and ingredients! Have I said I loved this place??!! The place is family owned and operated, they know my name and my order before I'm completely in the door! Try the hot pastrami if you are in the area for lunch. Sooo gooood."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. This place is cute and good for a quick stop for breakfast before work. I've only had the bagels, which they have a huge selection and are good. I see they also have lunch options including teriyaki type food. My only complaint today is the cashier was very rude and with any question I had, she just pointed to the signs and was very short. She didn't say hi or smile once. I'm not sure what her name is because she didn't have a name tag or introduce herself, but she had gage earrings, nose piercing, middle of her top lip piercing, and dark short hair with bangs. Someone should tell her to have a better attitude!"}
{"text":"I love this cute little place.  The owners are always nice and the staff is very polite and helpful.  They have great lunch sandwiches at good prices.  The Ruben is delicious and I love their potato salad and pasta salad.  The bagels are also very good.  Try the orange bagel!  It's awesome. Fresh and delicious.  They also have Asian food on the menu that I have not had yet, but it smells amazing when it's cooking.  Going back for sure."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great bagel place, this is a great option! I came here to do homework. It's nice and quiet, they have amazing coffee! They have quite a variety of flavors including sugar-free options and also dairy free options. The bagels are all homemade and they have a great variety of them as well as cream cheeses. There is even baked goods such as muffins cookies and breads to choose from! What I love best about this is their lunch option, teriyaki chicken! What bagel place have you gone to that has teriyaki chicken for lunch? The owners put a cultural spin on their bagel shop and I added Chinese food for lunch. It's the best of both worlds! I praise on their uniqueness and talk about it to everyone!!! I will continue to go to this bagel place to support their local business over any Starbucks or corporate bagel shop! Most of the people that go in are in and out for lunch or a coffee but I had no problem sitting there at a table and doing my homework for a couple hours nor did the owners mind it at all. In fact it's kind of my new hangout spot on my days off! Thankyou Bagel Gourmet!"}
{"text":"This place isn't far from my house so when we are craving something quick and easy for breakfast we stop at Bagel Gormet. In fact we went there as late as last week although throughout the years we have been there many times. They have a wide selection of bagels that are awesome. They specialize in Old World Water Boiled Bagels (makes all the difference) . 

We normally get the Denver Breakfast Bagel (Egg, Ham, Cheese, Bell Pepper, Onion). The first time my wife & I tried their bagels we both were flabbergasted. Right away we thought this is what a bagel should taste like. Their bagels are fresh, tasty ,chewy, doughy and so delicious.   

In summary, when you go to Bagel Gormet, you can expect fresh  bagels with a nice variety of spreads. Plus they serve great Sandwiches, salades and deserts.

CUSTOMER SERVICE:  The service was extremely fast (as fast as it can be done) and everyone was very friendly. The people who work here are nice and down to earth FOOD: Delectable  ....sooo delicious. Bagels are soft, flavorful and delicious  AMBIENCE: The inside is comfy and quaint . Comfortable feel a good place for to grt a quick bite or cup of coffee casual conversation. CONCLUSION: I would recommend this place to anyone!!!   Delicious bagels!!!  So check them out!!"}
{"text":"This place was average. The service was average. My bagel was not toasted as requested and the capers were missing. The ingredients tasted fresh. The asiago bagel was also average. The coffee was tasty. It wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about either."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch today with my 2 year old and was met by a very sweet, friendly couple who run the shop. The food was excellent, reasonably priced and quickly served. There were so many lunch options and I was especially impressed with how clean the shop was! As a mom I didn't have to worry about whether or not the tables and high chair were clean enough...this place was absolutely spotless!

What won me over completely was the customer service. They helped me set up the high chair since my hands were full and then visited with us a little while longer. My little boy, who is extremely shy, was grinning from ear to ear and laughing at the owner playing peekaboo with him from behind the counter.  I loved that they weren't too busy to show an active interest in even the littlest of their patrons.

All that to say, I will be going back soon and I will be letting all my friends know about this little gem of an establishment."}
{"text":"Please correct me if I sound ignorant but this place has a sign that says \"espresso, mochas, cappuccino...\" I went in and ordered an iced americano. The owner looked at me like I was nuts and I asked her if she knew what that was. She said she did but kept looking at me and rolling her eyes. For those that don't know, it's espresso, ice and water. She kept shaking her head and I said \"is there something wrong,\" to which she answered yes. I said \"ok I will just go somewhere else\" and she nodded ok
I feel like I just left the twilight zone. It's hard enough to find good coffee which is why I went in to try it out. Left empty handed feeling confused. Won't be back"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time yesterday. I got a bagel breakfast sandwich and it was delicious! It was made fresh. They bagel was soft and moist and I had fresh veggies in my sandwich. This place was so good, I came back today to order again! They offer tons of options for bagels and cream cheeses. Their prices are reasonable. They also take special requests! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I'm only reviewing because I went here because of Yelp.
The service was very friendly and efficient. The entry was not very clean and the bathrooms matched. They had only half of the bagel selection that  they list which is no biggie.
Had the lox and bagel plate. This was a sandwich where you almost couldn't see the lox.
The ingredients were very fresh but please charge more and put at least an average amount of lox on the bagel. Will go to Chompies next time."}
{"text":"I LOVE Bagel Gourmet. It's close to my house so I stop there for breakfast sometimes. I pick up a dozen bagels with two tubs of cream cheese for my coworkers sometimes and they love them now too. They have a big variety of true, boiled bagels with unusual flavors. My favorite is the Spinach Parmesan with Southwestern cream cheese. YUM!"}
{"text":"I usually get a salt, cheese or veggie bagel, all of them are great and under a $1, if you just want it plain.
I love their flavored coffee. I don't have to put a ton of milk in it, I can actually drink it black...I save the calories for the bagel. 
The service is always fast and friendly. Stop in, I can't imagine you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here for both a morning bagel and a lunch sandwich basket, and have yet to be disappointed.  It is close to my office so I come by at least a couple times a month.  The staff is always friendly and you feel like a regular after only dining in a few times."}
{"text":"I have become a regular here recently. I have not met cooler business owners, especially ones who will go out of their way for customers. If that wasn't enough, the food is great! Water boiled bagels and amazing variations. Plus, this is the only place I can get vegetarian kimchi in a huge jar and/or on my bagel. Enjoy."}
{"text":"It's ok. Not the best bagel I have ever had but not the worse by far. There was a nice selection of bagel flavors to choose from. Texture was like a bagel. If I go again, I will ask them to toast it more though. I like the golden brown color on my bagels after they have been toasted. You can pick off the breakfast and lunch menu all day. The lady at the counter was very nice and friendly. They had a variety of coffee flavoring and what looked like a cappuccino machine. 

This place has been here since Fred Meyers was the store. But this is the first time I have ever been. They could use an update/renovation, but the place is clean."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and think the bagels are very good but I'm not a huge fan of the coffee and their sandwiches.

I suggest you pick up some everything bagels. So good. 

Employees are super friendly and recognize the regulars without issue.

Prices are great, you really can't beat 'em. You won't find another bagel place around here at these prices."}
{"text":"Great Bagels and Bagelettes! Their Bagel Omelette sandwiches are fantastic and I have to get one every time!

I believe it was a recent item, a country-style breakfast burrito. Eggs with Sausage and Gravy. Thats what it is supposed to be but what I ended up getting was a log of cooked egg (it was good well, I'll say that) and flavorless sausage gravy drizzled over the log.  By log, I mean when I unraveled the tortilla to see what I had gotten, it was a single cylindrical brick of cooked egg. Without trying to come off as rude I have to admit it was kinda gross. I was so disappointed because thats one of my favorite styled breakfast burritos. 

I would love to come back and try another one but this was not a country breakfast burrito. I'll stick to the standard menu for now but definitely come and try this great place! Their coffee options are great and it always gives me that small diner feeling when I drink it. 

The atmosphere is okay, nothing terribly special, but it doesn't seem to have a strict theme so its hard to say."}
{"text":"Good food... opinion finely dice your Jalepenos in your cream cheese, slices of them yuk! It wasnt spicy either... add some of the seeds."}
{"text":"Great bagels, friendly staff, cozy atmosphere.  It will definitely become a regular stop for the family!"}
{"text":"Bagel Gourmet might be a rough gem that's located by the Fry's Super Market on Bell Rd with all the solar tiles that cover the parking lot.

This might be the most unusual Bagel Shop out there. Besides an assortment of bagels, sandwiches, wraps, salads, deviled eggs and more...this bagel shop SERVES UP JAPANESE FOOD!

I noticed that the bagels are very large so we just shared a sandwich. We shared a fresh made bagel with nova lox and cream cheese. The bagel seemed very freshly made but was somewhat roll like. The cream cheese was thinly spread on both sides of the bagel and the vegetable layers of tomato and onion included and unusual addition of cucumber. The nova lox was better than what you can purchase from Fry's but wasn't the best. This was an OK sandwich. Not the best and not the worst but it was very large and very inexpensive.

As for the Lunch Box menu they also serve up Teriyaki, Yaki Soba, Fried Rice and Dumplings.

Service was SPEEDY

Atmosphere is very dated

Prices are very low

They have indoor and outdoor seating"}
{"text":"I grew up starting my day with a roll & butter or my favorite a bagel with butter. I know what you're thinking, the same thought I had, simple find a great bagel shop in Arizona and start your day right. 

Finding a ordinary bagel is easy, regardless of where you live. Finding a great bagel that's boiled, baked and given a generous schmear of  butter or cream cheese is tough in these parts, that is until I found  Bagels Gourmet .

The bagels at Hot Bagel Gourmet are deliciously fresh.  These bagel are everything a bagel should be.  The bagel's are crispy, chewy,  perfection.

If you're ever in the area and want to taste  delicious bagels, and expeirebce great customer service, stop in.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great bagels, soups and sandwiches! They do a bakers dozen- buy 12, get 13. The jalapeno cheese has the right amount of kick. Three flavors of coffee to choose from. This is a gem tucked away in the Fry's center on Bell, just west of I-17.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Clean place with friendly help.  But a big disappointment with the bagels.  I avoided my favorite bagel (garlic), because they use garlic powder instead of bits of garlic.  I've never even seen that before!  Had the onion instead.  kept it un-toasted so I could really check out the bagel.  it was kind of like bread inside.  

This place is in a decent location.  And it could be doing a land office business if they would perfect the bagels.

For now, there's nothing to bring me back."}
{"text":"A nice little restaurant in the Fry's shopping center near the I-17 and Bell Road. The owner is a very nice lady and the food is very decent. If they are out of a bagel you can always call them and make a request to pick it up the next day and then we'll have the appropriate inventory that you want to pick up. Their smoothies are absolutely awesome especially the peach smoothie. Never been disappointed yet and if this one a nice cup of coffee and a bagel or sandwich it's a good place to stop by."}
{"text":"These are not east coast bagels, but they are pretty darn good for Phoenix. Plus the prices are easy on the wallet and the lox & cream cheese are fresh. They have lots of bagels to choose from and the people that work there are super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews on this place, I have to say I was disappointed in the bagel. 

I was craving the classic: plain bagel toasted with plain cream cheese. The bagel itself was the big disappointment. As one reviewer pointed out, it tasted like bread. It didn't have that chewy inside and crisp outside that sets apart a really great bagel. I can't vouch for any of the bagel sandwiches, but if the basic bagel doesn't wow me, I wouldn't be hard pressed to try other offerings here."}
{"text":"Damn good stuff... hand boiled and baked. 

Service was quick and friendly. Prices seem reasonable. 

I had a Cornbeef on sesame, with swiss and 1000 island, and some homemade pasta salad....yummy"}
{"text":"Best breakfast bagel sandwich I've ever had. Sausage, egg, and cheese on a salt bagel. The bagels are obviously boiled/baked the correct way and taste homemade. Service is friendly and fast. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The pros: the people who work here are very sweet and helpful. They have a lot of drink options and a very large menu, including Asian cuisine! 

The cons: the bagels- the fact I asked for their soup choice and they didn't have any, even though soup is on the menu.

I feel like for a bagel shop, the bagels should be great. I ordered an egg bagel and got poppy seed. 

If you're looking for OK food, this is about all you're going to get here."}
{"text":"I came here after reading such good yelp reviews. After my first and only trip, sorry to say these are not real bagels. Take it from a nice jewish girl. They say the bagels here are boiled, but they sure didn't taste that way. The place was very clean and had good customer service. The bagels themselves are .92 each which is very reasonable, but to add butter is 1.75 or cream cheese 2.50! My husband and I split a cinnamon bagel with butter, and a Denver bagel breakfast sandwich made with everything bagel, egg, ham, green pepper, onion and cheese. The bagels weren't toasted well. The egg sandwich was sparse on ingredients and almost flavorless. It was bad. Cute place, but lacking in taste and quality. Not gourmet and nothing to bring us back, unfortunately. This place was definitely overrated"}
{"text":"So happy I stumbled upon this place! Speedy service and polite and friendly staff. Bagels and bagel sandwich were delicious! My new go-to for office and client breakfasts."}
{"text":"Fresh bagels all the time.  Tried their Cafe late for the first time, was very good and less wait then the Starbucks next door."}
{"text":"Local, clean, and nice people. What more can you ask for a business in part of the  community? Also, their bagels are super good. Lunch of rice and beef is surprisingly tasty as well."}
{"text":"They are extremely generous with the cream cheese on their bagels. The service is very fast and friendly at the same time."}
{"text":"Love their bagels!  Huge selection with flavors I've never seen before.  My favorite is the spinach Parmesan bagel with veggie cream cheese.  Love the bagel chips too!  

Staff is always super friendly!"}
{"text":"Delicious Caramel Macchiato! I will be back to try other drinks & a bagel or breakfast burrito soon! Super sweet & friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this bagel place since I was a little girl and it never disappoints!! My favorite is the cinsational bagel with the egg, cheese and sausage! Omg so yummy! My boyfriend got the rueben sandwich and that was super yummy too! I need to try more things, seeing I've been coming for years and I keep getting the same thing! Lol it's so good tho!"}
{"text":"We always order from here at work and the bagels are constantly good but I will say the last few times I ordered, the cream cheese was off. Last time I got the jalapeno cream cheese and it is simply cream cheese and sliced of raw jalapeno (weird to me). This time I got the south of the boarder salsa and it was just cream cheese with salsa mixed in. I guess I just expected something that I couldn't make myself. My coworkers got BLT bagels and they lived them so maybe I'll try that next time."}
{"text":"The family that owns this place are the sweetest. I usually stop here in the morning to grab a chai drink. So close to work. They have a good chicken noodle soup and the bagels are delicious. I just took off one star because I don't like the quality of ingredients in their breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"We had to drop the car in at the Jeep Dealership for an oil change very early the other morning and as a result did not have time for breakfast! : (
We remembered there was a Fry's Store nearby so drove in that direction  but when we pulled into the mall area we stumbled across Bagel Gourmet. I am so glad we did, the bagels are fresh, moist, lots of flavors to choose from and very tasty. You can get them toasted and with different toppings. We chose the cream cheese which was very good. Can recommend the apple and cinnamon bagel as well as the cinnamon and raison bagel. The coffee is also very good unlike the car dealership's coffee!!!"}
{"text":"I've never experienced anything but pleasant helpful staff any time I've been here. Years ago I dropped by on my way to work for a bagel & drink, they were fast and good then. Today I have them deliver to my home and they were fresh, good and they've changed up the spreads to even better. There is actual veggies in the garden vegetable spread. I do prefer the previous way of doing spinach and cheese bagels but this one is excellent as well. I also ordered a sandwich, that didn't come out right but Linda was very helpful and easy to deal with in regards to a replacement order."}
{"text":"Awesome selection of cream cheese and the bagels are amazing! Wish they were open all day"}
{"text":"Great personal service! We are regulars here. They have memorized our lox order. My toddler ate a muffin here; I didn't realize it, but he did less eating and disassembling of said muffin on to the floor. They continue to be so gracious, even after he has freshly mopped the floor and they see us coming. 

The boil their bagels in house. They'll make you any kind of coffee/espresso derivative your heart desires."}
{"text":"Super helpful and friendly counter help, but the food wasn't good.  My bagel had a strong chemical taste and the plain coffee tasted like flavored coffee.  Worrisome."}
{"text":"We've been here twice already since moving into the neighborhood. The bagels are made in house and super yummy. The iced mochas are deeeeeelish!"}
{"text":"After driving by this place, my mom mentioned to me that they sell one of the best bagels. So we stopped by to grab something to eat. There were so many bagels to choose from and I didn't know what to get. The cashier told me that he usually gets their spinach and cheese bagel and how you can actually taste the spinach. So I thought to myself, I like spinach and cheese. Okay why not? So I got one to go and also ordered their italian soda. Sadly, the bagel tasted plain and the italian soda was watered down (tasted like water mixed with cool whip). When we got back to the car, my mom told me that she had mistaken this shop with the one that she normally goes to."}
{"text":"So unpretentious is this little gem that I didn't even know it was here. Totally worth a trip to grab an omelet on a bagel, a specialty coffee, or an italian soda. They also serve some Asian cuisine!"}
{"text":"If you like real bagels, this is not the place for you. They are more like bread, not dense and chewy. They gave us the wrong bagel on one sandwich, flavors were very bland and disappointing."}
{"text":"I would definitely come back! Being from the north east bagels are important and unfortunately you don't find the best out west. I ordered the cinnamon bagel which they gave a creative name I can't remember. However it must sound like spinach parmesan because that's what I was given. However it was a good fluffy bagel also... but I am looking forward to going back and get the cinnamon."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome teriyaki chicken dish during lunch time! It isn't your traditional chicken teriyaki. It is home made with a lighter sauce and grilled chicken. The chicken is very delicious and juicy. My husband and I eat here all the time just for that one meal."}
{"text":"Great bagels. Good service. Good food but the place could use a deep cleaning. The service is ok too."}
{"text":"After waiting for my toasted bagel with cream cheese for over 25 minutes, the bagel was barely toasted and still mostly cold. The sundried tomato cream cheese was fine. The asiago bagel tasted less like a bagel should and more like regular bread."}
{"text":"Me being a business owner I hate when it comes down to me righting a less than perfect rating but do to mis-management it needs to be said.
The restaurant it self needs a good cleaning getting run down even to the point where I look for the rating from the city. very cautious ?
second for a breakfast place to be out of 
Asigio cheese bagels, fruit cups, and hash browns ???? really fry's is literally 200 ft. away why don't you go shopping other than tell customers you are out of common breakfast staples.
And even worse you acted like it was a common thing ??? 
Now for the bagels you got to lose the name gourmet because 5 years ago hell ya  
today OOHHH NNOOO  maybe try toasting it a bit longer because this was not good no crunch just dough in your mouth thinking do I really want to swallow this and I didn't picked out the ham and egg ate that the other was supposed to have bacon but got ham on that one to all I could guess was they were probably out of bacon too. 
Tip to owner you had a good thing going but as owners we cant get complacent  and comfortable what worked years ago wont withstand poor- and lazy operating requirements 
all I see in the future if you continue like this is a sign in the window space or restaurant for lease 
Good Luck Rick"}
{"text":"Very friendly service and prices are normal for a place like this. Conveniently located near a Frys grocery store, car wash, bank and more. Good place to eat and also if you have to run errands."}
{"text":"I pass by this place all the time (I go to the Fry's that is next door) and it is close to work.  Never stopped in for a bagel until the other day.  With a name like \"Bagel Gourmet\" I was hoping that I had found a good bagel joint.  Sadly, it wasn't the case!

I walked inside and placed an order for their version of an \"everything bagel\", toasted with cream cheese and then a plain salt bagel.  My total was $4.00, I took a seat and in a few minutes the lady behind the counter came out with my bag.  I took them to work and dug in.  Here is how they were..............

Everything Bagel (They call it something else like a \"works\" bagel) with cream cheese-  First thing I noticed was that this bagel was very circular and fat, almost like a baseball.  The outside of the bagel had a decent amount of toppings on it, but not as much as I prefer.  I took a bite in and noticed that it wasn't toasted too well.  It had a super light toast to it and I wish it was toasted just a bit more.  Texture wise, the bagel was \"off\", too!  It didn't have the crisp/crunchy exterior and the soft middle.  It was basically like eating a dinner roll that was toasted a bit.  Meh.  At least the cream cheese was tasty! 

Salt Bagel-  This was even more baseball shaped than the other one.  It was cold and nasty.  I ripped it apart and took about 2 bites of it and tossed it in the trash.  Once again, no crusty exterior, minimal salt, and the innards tasted like plain bread.  One of the worst bagels I can remember eating.

Overall, sadly, I will not be back.  These bagels were sub par and just not that good!  The works one was at least decent and the cream cheese was good.  I would much rather get bagels elsewhere though...hell, even store brought Thomas or Sara Lee bagels are better than these!  Much better, actually!   Service was friendly and the price wasn't a total ripoff for 2 bagels so that is the sole reason this gets 2 stars.  Meh. I've experienced better!"}
{"text":"So good!  This is was my first time here and I will definitely be back!  I had the Swiss bagel toasted with garlic her cream cheese and it is so yummy.  Also, being from Washington where coffee is the best anywhere, it is hard to find anything that compares in Phoenix...they are pretty dang close!  Iced cafe mocha is delicious!"}
{"text":"Kind of odd to go to a bagel shop and just get bread with cream cheese.  The bagels don't taste like classic, standard boiled bagels.  Not quite sure what they do in their bagel preparation to have bagels taste like regular bread, but I don't like it.  Service is good.  Lots of good choices on the menu. Italian Soda tasted pretty flat, so I wouldn't recommend it.  Also their Orange Juice is from concentrate, which is a no-no these days!  

Drive about 2 miles west to 43rd Avenue/Bell (NW corner) to find Einstein Bagels.  I'm all about supporting local businesses, but Bagel Gourmet needs to step up their game for my continued support."}
{"text":"After just transferring to Phoenix a few days ago I found myself starving and looking for something breakfast wise.  I go to Fry's for a Tully's coffee but nothing there piqued my interest so I remembered there was a bagel place in the plaza.  
The outside wasn't anything to write home about once I went in I was greeted by two ladies who seemed actually HAPPY to serve me!  Their menu was easy to see, they have their bagel selection right out front so you can see what you'll be getting which I found nice.  I settled on a Bagel with cheese, egg and bacon.  While paying I felt bad about not having cash on hand seeing as my bill only came to $3.95, the lady reassured me it was totally fine and went about placing my order with the back.  I was hand-delivered my sandwich in under 10 minutes with a warm smile and \"have a great day\".

The sandwich was great, the service was awesome, the place was clean and comfortable.  I will be going back when in the area for sure!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the bagel breakfast sandwich!  Also had an iced mocha which actually good! :) will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch spot.  Way more than just their delicious bagels! Kind of deceiving, also I love how really they are open.  Their cinn-sational bagel is delicious.  The people in there are friendly as well! 
Great specialty coffees"}
{"text":"Love this little place! The husband and wife duo are so cute and friendly! The bagels are the most doughy amazing thickness and fresh for amazing prices! Definitely a new favorite breakfast shop."}
{"text":"Great bagel. They even have salted bagels which are hard to find. Yum! I want to go back to try some of their sandwich options. The staff is very friendly and helpful as well."}
{"text":"Fresh, yummy bagels and gourmet hot coffee for breakfast!  I Got my order fast and the staff were great!  
You have to give them a try!"}
