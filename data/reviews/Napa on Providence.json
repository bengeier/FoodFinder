{"text":"This place has a lot of promise (and it's been around for a long while), but for my husband and me it falls way short of getting there.  The culinary style seems dated, and the dishes lack energy, finesse and interest--absolutely not Californian! I was surprised to be served a pizza that reminded me of an Apian Way box mix from the 60's, with a crust that had the texture of matzo bread (i.e. crackers).  Extremely bland--barely palatable.  My husband's gazpacho was so-so, as was his main dish (I can't recall what it was at the moment).  However, we were with two other couples who seemed to like their food! Hence the popularity of this restaurant."}
{"text":"service was good, but myself and my date thought it was quite pricey. Two dollar signs should tell me entrees are 15 to 20 dollars. Try 28 each for the tuna and osso bucco, with no sides. Entrée is just that, an entrée, with a loaf of hard assed bread and honey butter that came from Food Lion. No veggies offered except for the rice both dishes were laid upon. The food itself was just OK, nothing exceptional. The building is beautiful and staff are great but I won't be rolling back. But that's just me."}
{"text":"I won't go back. The most exciting aspect of this restaurant is that they claim to have barrel dispensed wine, house made breads and cheeses(!) and farm-to-table menu. Oh yes, all of these sound great but might just be marketing ploys. The wine is dispensed from kegs(they say barrel to make it sound fancy.) I love the keg wine idea if it's used to offer better wines at reasonable prices, but this restaurant makes a killing off their wine program and offer no values. Examples- Pine Ridge Chenin Blanc retail-$12/ this restaurant $45, Pennywise Petite Sirah retail $10/ here-$44, Caymus Cab retail- $65/ here $150. Could you imagine a wine barrel behind a bar anyway? 

The food quality is good, but I want more! I want damn good food when I pay $25 for a plate. Why is \"good\" the standard and they don't try for great, exciting food? The menu covers all the necessities: fish, check; steak, check; chicken, check; a house specialty; check...Boring, check. The food quality and decor earned them two stars in my book. Now, get creative, use local food sources and cut your wine prices in half and you'll catch up with the 2000s.

I don't know if the bread is made in house- our server didn't know either. When asked about the house made cheeses, the server explained there aren't any. Then went on to say the Humboldt Fog cheese is from Humboldt County, NC(ouch!). And you'd think if the produce or meat were local they might mention the farms they source from, but no. And, yep the server didn't know where the produce or meats came from either. 

Maybe, I am completely in the wrong and they simply don't want to put farms' names on the menu or haven't found reliable sources since opening. Maybe this is actually a farm-to-table restaurant and I just had a clueless server. Maybe they make their own cheeses and breads and maybe Humboldt Fog comes from Humboldt County, North Carolina."}
{"text":"i really enjoyed this place. Went for lunch. Little off the beaten path but a good find. I had Chicken Agnolotti in a white wine crema; delicious. Wait staff is professional and our waitress presented herself as such. She was kind and courteous also. Just a great little atmosphere. You just need to go try it out. The menu is creative and fresh. If you watch the show chopped your mind will wander to the last show you watched when you read the menu.For example here is a dessert: \"Chef's, today for dessert I made for you a chocolate beet cake; it is a dark chocolate ganache, whipped mascarpone, raspberry coulis with crispy beet chips; Enjoy.\""}
{"text":"Great service, but almost too personal. My waiter shook my hand upon introduction, asked my name, and continued to call me by my first name throughout my entire dining experience. All of the food was delicious, from the complimentary bread (with pomegranate butter) to the dessert (Chocolate Pie with a graham cracker crust). Overall, I had a positive experience, but I found it overpriced for what I got. Would think twice before going again."}
{"text":"I've been here 5 or 6 times (it's right by my house), so I feel like I can write a fair review of Napa.

Service: inconsistent. Hosts are always great, but servers are really hit and miss. I've actually had better, more attentive service at times when it's busy than at times when it's not, which is sort of weird.

Cocktails: fantastic. Their barrel-infused spirits are a must-try. Good mimosas and bloodys, too.

Wine: meh. There are some okay choices, but the wine list doesn't blow me away.

Food: decent. The poached eggs on the benedict have been way overdone both times I've tried it. The potatoes are awesome.

Atmosphere: stellar. The patio is especially beautiful. Can be pretty loud when they have live music.

If they upped the service and food game even just a little, I'd be here all the time."}
{"text":"OMG! What took me so long to visit? This place is wonderful! The curb appeal is excellent. I love the wine vines that line the entry way. The atmosphere, indoor and out, is cottage chic. The outdoor patio is so inviting.  It feels like you've been invited to a fabulous dinner party. What a great space!

The staff is super friendly! The hostesses, waiters and manager were all very pleasant and attentive (without being annoying). They genuinely wanted to ensure that we had a great experience. 

The food is DELICIOUS! We came for restaurant week so we enjoyed a three course meal and a glass of wine for $30. We decided to share everything. The meal includes warm bread and fresh pomegranate honey butter. The butter was incredible!! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. For dinner, we started with the sautéed shrimp gnocchi and kale salad. Both were flavorful and delicious. For the main course, we ordered the hanger steak with risotto and the bone-in pork chop over a light German pasta. The steak was tender and juicy. The risotto was good, but the grains were a little large for my personal taste. The show stopper was the bone-in pork chop. It was absolutely amazing!!  It's was thick, but still juicy, tender and sooooo flavorful. I couldn't get enough. The restaurant rotates the menu items. If this item is on the menu it is a must try!! 

For dessert, we split the salted caramel cheesecake and the peaches and creme. They were a great way to finish a fabulous meal. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the peaches and cream a little but more than the cheesecake. It was so light and it had a blueberry compote in the middle. Yum! 

I also really enjoyed the house merlot (which the manager treated us too since we had to wait a while for a table). It was a Prologue by Anderson's Conn Valley Vineyards. It was delicious. It was light and fruity with a smooth finish. 

I can't wait to visit again. They have happy hour specials in the evening and live music a few nights a week. They also have brunch on Sundays.

After only one visit this is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I love everything about this place. The atmosphere, the food, the wine and the people. Great job guys!!"}
{"text":"Dinner was absolutely delicious. Had the braised short rib and flank steak. Wife's dinner was equally amazing. Brad suggested a perfect wine to go with dinner, fantastic! Lea was a great server, all made it a great Saturday night out and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went there before a show and dined at the bar around 7:00 for about an hour. Feb.22.
Bartender,(i think his name was John) was personable and assisted us in a timely fashion.
He suggested a tuna appetizer and then served us our bottle of wine while we pondered.
He then left. Think he was elsewhere in the restaurant.We then flagged a bartender( female) down and ask if we could order.
She was less than enthusiastic to say the least. When we ordered the tuna, she quickly said\"we're out\". She very rude and condescending. We then ordered a couple of different things, ate quickly and attempted once again to find someone to close out. 
We were never asked how our food was, offered to pour our wine etc....
Too many great options we have experienced elsewhere in Charlotte, will not return to this one."}
{"text":"I was there last Saturday for the restaurant week. Menu was not creative and just same all things served everywhere. Food was decent but not spectacular.  I had steak. It was more like steak tips with A LOT of potatoes. Not worth it. Ambiance is great, but I would not go again."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner for a friend's birthday and as part of Charlotte Restaurant Week. We had reservations at 7pm and showed up early for a drink at the bar first. The bar staff promptly served us! Right at 7pm our table was ready. At the table, our waitress, Allison, was fantastic! Very attentive and great personality. My wife and I both ordered off the Queens Feast menu. She ordered the steak and was even able to substitute her sides. I ordered the grouper. Everything was excellent. The manager stopped by twice to check on us! Great food, great staff, great time! Definitely will be coming back again."}
{"text":"One of the best brunches in Charlotte! Usually my fiancé and I target smaller mom and pop restaurants for Sunday brunch and dinner dining but decided to give Napa on Providence a try because of the great reviews and farm to table menu! We were both beyond impressed! The service was outstanding, the host, the bartender who served us a drink as we waited for our table, and especially our server Katy! We started with raw oysters on the half shell along with typical brunch beverages including a bloody Mary and mimosa (which i was thrilled to find were bottomless for brunch). Amazing! The pancetta hash and the quiche of the day that followed were both to die for! Everything about this place was awesome, down to the ambiance and the hammered copper water glasses on each table. We will most certainly be back. Do yourself a favor and check out this true hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I went for brunch. The restaurant itself is really beautiful and And has an outdoor patio. The food is reasonably priced and tasty. Not the best I've ever had, but good. The service was excellent as well. Unlimited mimosas are $10!"}
{"text":"ok - first problem - walk in tell hostess I want a TABLE
 - no prob  she says - then wants my name - no prob -  I  give her my last name - she puts it in tablet and then asks for first name - ok - give it to her - end of discussion - she informs alternate hostess and there we go - to a BOOTH - what part of I WANT A TABLE do you not understand - ok - we just let it go.  Next problem - what is with the high intesity lighting - change out those high light to soft lites - oh and by the way - turn down the f'n music - okay I am genuinly pissed at this point - OPTIONS halibut and swordfish and then 1 beef  1chcken 1 pork - not happening - sauce on hailbit was overwhelming - hubby said no way jose -  better waiters - better clothes - sorry I like black tops black pants - green tops/khaki tops - no way - do not want to be ugly but unless they really change this up -no way going back there"}
{"text":"Me and a few friends had dinner at Napa on Providence on a Wednesday night. A co-worker suggested the place and had good things to say so I was eager to try it.

The first thing I noticed when arriving was the beautiful art on the walls and high ceilings.We were seated past the bar in the area of the dining room which overlooked the terrace. on a cooler day I think it would have been an ideal place to sit. The waitress immediately came by to provide water and fresh bread with a nice honey butter. The menu had a lot of unique items and the wine list was extensive but not overwhelming offering by the glass, carafe, and by the bottle offerings. 

I had a glass of rosé which was very good and not overly sweet, while my friend had a cabernet. For entrees I ordered the mushroom and crab ravioli which was very light, flavorful and refreshing from the lemon zest and the black pepper ravioli. It was a good choice to pair with the rose, and would probably also go well with a Chardonnay or Viognier from the wine list. My friends had the duck duo and the hanger steak salad, both of which looked very good. 

There were many items on the appetizer list as well as other dishes I would like to try in the future based on some of the dishes other diners had around me, the pizzas and charcuterie looked great and I plan on trying the swordfish on next visit. Overall I thought the food, service, decor, and wine list were excellent. 

I would be mindful that the parking is a little sparse but I believe there may be lots nearby or even at Harris Teeter if space is limited."}
{"text":"Great food, decently priced for Myers Park. The ambience is a little lacking but I think it's getting better. If RuRu's was closed or if I was in the mood to stay local and drink some vino, this is where I would go."}
{"text":"I  visited Napa on Providence for lunch with a fairly decent sized group. We were immediately greeted and seated. The service was great and the restaurant was really cute. I loved the decor. The food was just OK. The bread and butter they serve was delicious but my main course was a little disappointing. The prices are also a little high for just OK food.

I would possibly go back and maybe try something different."}
{"text":"Great outside patio, friendly service. The dining room is spacious and not too loud. Great brunch!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner the other night and had an awesome experience. Can be difficult to find parking but the hostess said we could park at the bank across the street and not get towed. Really nice booths and tables. Upscale but laid back atmosphere. Cool water cups and glasses. Good wine selection. Our server was Chad and he took great care of us. Started out with a complimentary small plate of shrimp and grits with chorizo, which was very tasty. We decided to share some small plates (tapas style). The raw oysters were delicious, but kind of small. The lemon shrimp gnocchi was refreshing and delectable. The stuffed meatballs were really good. The beef carpaccio was pretty good too. Really great food and service!"}
{"text":"Party of four went to Napa Sunday 7-19-15 at 7pm for an anniversary dinner celebration. 

On the way into Napa be sure to notice the grape vines along the walk with clusters of ripe concord grapes... juicy and semisweet.

Napa's style is California fusion with emphasis on new American cuisine: updated presentation of favorites using locally sourced fresh ingredients. Napa offers a \"3-course for $30\" option in addition to an extensive menu of a la carte offerings.  Napa has an extensive wine list, beer and other mixed drinks from the bar.The coffee is good, and the dessert offerings are quite tempting... something is sure to appeal to everyone.

The restaurant is very inviting; subdued lighting creates an intimate atmosphere. The staff is friendly and accommodating. Our waitress was an excellent server, made helpful recommendations... and in general was a sweetheart who checked frequently on our needs for drink refills including keeping the pewter water tumblers topped off with chilled water. She also brought another loaf of bread with more pomegranate-honey butter just in the nick of time.

Two celebrating their anniversary had the salmon, one had a pasta & chicken entrée. I had the hanger steak and braised short rib... my meal was excellent. \"Near miss\" comments... that the chicken in the pasta dish was sparse, but the dish was very tasty. Also the fresh steamed green beans were a bit too al dente to suit our party.

If you wish to have a quiet evening, request seating away from the kitchen area which can get a bit noisy when busy. However, the kitchen is well run with very little need for loud verbal communication.

Another tip... if a restaurant looks clean... wonderful. BUT the neglected area (that tells the REAL TALE) will be the men's restroom... go take a look sometime during your evening. Napa has one of the BEST KEPT men's rooms in Charlotte... virtually spotless! AND the plush hand towels... paper but feel almost like cloth... AND ACTUALLY ARE LARGE ENOUGH that ONE is sufficient to dry BOTH YOUR HANDS! Well done, Napa!"}
{"text":"Very lovely place for dinner with friends or a significant other. We enjoyed all of our appetizers and entrees. The waiter was great and attentive to our needs, and the chef as well.  My only complaint is that this place is short on parking spots and we were not too impressed with our desserts."}
{"text":"This was a tough one for me to write, because the food was good...the service was good, everything was good...so why 3 stars?  Because it wasn't very memorable, the prices are a bit steep, and I did't feel any \"wow\"! 

A couple girlfriends and I went on a weeknight, and it was busy, but not difficult to get a table.  The housemade honey/pomegranate butter Kellie K. mentioned in her review really is a nice touch...as is the warm bread.  Add points. 

We shared a meatball appetizer which looked visually appealing...three cheese stuffed meatballs on little beds of polenta.  The meatballs were  a bit on the salty side...and had way too much pepper...but overall edible and were all consumed. 

For my main, I had crab stuffed trout with broccolini and roasted red peppers.  It was...like the meatballs, edible and fine.  But I wouldn't go home and pine...yearn...have a burning desire to eat these things again.  

My friends had pizzas...which looked good...they said were good...but would have been just as good as a higher end pizza restaurant, like Wolfgang Puck or Pure. 

For dessert, we shared a trio of creme brûlée (one vanilla, the other berry, and orange blossom) which were all good, but again...it's creme brûlée.  The pannacotta was a bit on the too congealed side, but also good...but not good enough to finish despite being full...or good enough to want to lick the plate clean. 

Our server was a doll...but we didn't get any real passion about the food, or sell on what would be delicious, so who knows, maybe we just ordered incorrectly. A man who looked like he maybe was the manager on duty or GM came over to assist in serving, and wasn't particularly friendly or warm, which we found strange. 

That and the price for what we got left us feeling a bit disappointed...but hey, you can sign up for their rewards program, so every $250 you spend,you get $25!  (That was said with a bit of sarcasm.) Honestly, I would have spent my $35 or however much my dinner was, at Good Food, and relished...savored...really paid attention and enjoyed the food and experience. 

Overall, it's a solid place...lovely interior and the food is a B.  But when I want to spend money and laugh and have a good time, I want to feel passion and love and energy ooze out of a restaurant, and will probably go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We love having drinks here. Unfortunately, we eat elsewhere because there's no substantial vegan options. Vegan lifestyle has grown 7% in the last two years... Get with the times so we can spend more of our $$$ here. ;)"}
{"text":"The outside of the place is so darn California-quaint you'll think you can see the Golden Gate Bridge in the back. 
A covered patio - featuring a guitarist when we went last Saturday night at 8:30pm - was packed with chatty wine-drinkers that looked so happy it seemed like were practicing for a commercial.
Inside, the place is small and has a good mix of modern/spare/winery vibe. Our waitress (Shannon?) was GREAT - knowledgable, funny, casual but attendant. Go to her and tip her well. She's probably the best service person ice seen in Charlotte so far.
The menu is very interesting. We had our choice of a variety of small plates, pizza, pasta, seafood, large plates, salads, etc. We chose a 6 piece charcuterie tasting which came on a beautiful slab of wood. A variety of house made cheeses along with some prosciutto, speck, bread triangles and - the best part - a few granola balls drizzled in local honey cuddling up to some glorious raspberries. Excellent.
Our pizza was a short rib and Gorgonzola number but I had that vile cheese ejected and replaced with some goat cheese. Gorgonzola = ew. It was VERY flavorful. The mushrooms on it were roasted and the onions caramelized, the meat tender, the pizza part of it was thin and bubbled from their pizza oven. Delicious.
Desserts were equally interesting. We had a ginger pannacotta that was as authentic as anything I ate in Japan. You don't really see hardcore ginger flavoring here and it was very good. 
And that was it.
Yes, we split a charcuterie board, a small pizza and a dessert and we were stuffed PLUS there were leftovers. We always guess on the bill amount, He estimated $100, I thought it would be more like $70. 
It was $48 - and $22 of it was a glass of wine He had! It was hard to gauge what was ordered as it all came with such flair and big flavor that it felt like more food. :) 
Next time, we will sit outside at the covered patron, alongside the grape vines (nice touch!) with the other prosciutto-eating wine drinkers and enjoy the music, the evening, the company and that amazing granola.
Or we try the brunch that Shannon raved about - she went on and on about the awesome offerings which all sounded so good. 
Plus, endless Mimosas are a very good thing."}
{"text":"Average food paired with a BORING happy hour and no social scene even for an older Myers Park crowd. This is despite a well designed space and very good service.  There is better food to be had elsewhere in the neighborhood and more fun to be had hanging out with the Myers Park locals across the street at the Harris Teeter wine bar."}
{"text":"We love this place! Great wines, great small plates, entrees, and most recently, amazing service. Lea was our server and she was the best!! Just the right amount of attentiveness, kind, helpful, funny-- she really made our experience perfect. Items we love (though not limited to): 
-Russian River pinot noir 
-oysters on the half shell
-mussels
-charcuterie
-the meatballs
-fig and prosciutto pizza
-flank steak salad"}
{"text":"Good bar scene, food was real salty. The chef must not have tasted any of the food, or he would not have served."}
{"text":"LOVE this cute cozy little neighborhood spot. NAPA is such a gem. Great food at great prices. Knowledgeable servers. Good wine. OVerall, great restaurant to visit during the week for a great meal."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Been 3 times already.  2 were out of this word, 1 was lackluster.  Really depends on who your server is!  Dinner and brunch are very good.  Cocktails are great.  Nice wine list!  Parking is challenging to say the least but worth it!"}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner here August 6th. First time since they changed name and format. I have to view this place with mixed feelings. The ambiance is 5**** but the food and service are lacking. Patio and music are very nice for drinks or starters. We ate inside. The service was lacking, slow and not well trained. Ordered drinks when we sat down and waited way too long for the order to be filled. When it came, one of the beverages was incorrect. Ordered white wine, received red. One of the martinis was mixed incorrectly. Menu is priced reasonably, but trying to be way more than what it is advertised as. Dover sole was disappointing in portion size and some 'mystery' sauce served on the plate was unexceptional. One of the servers spilled a glass of water on my place and nearly drenched me. No offer of desert or a free beverage for the inconvenience. I'd go back for a drink on the patio with music, but will pass on any future dinner visit this year. Might try it for lunch."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, good live music (wed n thurs), above average food quality. Definitely a place to bring your love one.

The second time I went there I was not as impressed.
The inside seating was too loud for those who want to have a conversation. It did not help that we had one of the worst waiter.
He could not remember my request for some olive oil. He did not even offer desserts for our side of the table. And he threw away food that my friend was planning to take home. The flank beef that I ordered was served cold.
I wonder if I will ever go back there again."}
{"text":"Unbelievable dinner. Charlie was our waiter and was so helpful on wine choice and food choices. We had the tuna tartar appetizer as well as the beef carpaccio. Both excellent dishes. For our mains we had the salmon, the tenderloin and the crab stuffed trout. All amazing. Cannot say enough about our wonderful experience. Cannot wait to come back to Charlotte and eat here again. Thank you Charlie for the wonderful meal and service!!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is relaxing, yet sexy. The noise level is moderate and it is a good date night location. Great, fresh food cooked perfectly. Good cocktail menu as well."}
{"text":"So sad to give this establishment a low rating. My experience with the food tonight was horrific. All 3 of our meals were terrible.  I have enjoyed prior visits and I truly like this restaurant. I want to see them succeed so I am hopeful that they had an off night.

Kudos to our waiter for recognizing we weren't thrilled with our dinner.  The management compensated us for our meals, which was not my intention. I was truly embarrassed to have recommended this restaurant to several people.

End result,
I won't be back anytime soon and I will no longer recommend Napa to my friends. 

Hoping this works itself out. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Awesome 1st experience here! My boyfriend took me for a date, our server was friendly & attentive. The restaurant itself it's gorgeous. The food was delicious! We'll be back soon"}
{"text":"Great spot. Hadn't been for over a decade but glad we went back for Mothers Day.  Enjoyed a lovely meal and Heather was a fantastic server. The only negative was my steak was medium versus medium rare as ordered. Everything else was terrific. The tuna tartare and pei mussles were great starters. Son's braised short ribs and daughters spaghetti were solid. My steak, while over cooked, had great flavor.  Definitely a must to go back sooner than later."}
{"text":"Napa on Providence is alway a favorite. Attended an event today an ordered off the brunch menu and ordered the chicken and waffle!!!! OMG!!! I absolutely loved it! Everyone I was with a group of 30+ people were not disappointed in their meals. Our group was very happy with the hosts choice. The wait staff was amazing and the bottomless mimosas was the icing on the cake. We will all be back."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great food and great service! Glad a girlfriend told me about this hidden gem. Ordered my entree but wasn't sure what wine to order so the bartender offered a few samplings before I decided! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful meal and excellent service!!!  Our waiter, Christian, helped create a wonderful dining experience from the minute we were seated. His recommendations and attentiveness were spot on. We started with the charcuterie plate and moved on to an entree of pork with pumpkin gnocchi for me and the duck duo for my boyfriend. The entire meal was delicious (and beautifully displayed as well!) 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant and look forward to going back and trying some of the small plates. A huge shout out to Christian for making it a special and delightful experience!"}
{"text":"We've been in Charlotte for a year now and I've always said we should try Napa on Providence but there are so many good places to eat... anyway, today we finally got there intending to sit outside as it was a beautiful day for mid December.  They were putting up temporary walls around the outside seating area for winter so inside we went but not to be disappointed by anything else!  

We arrived around three in the afternoon on a weekday so it was nearly empty and we were shown to a nice booth in the California wine country themed main dining room.  Cara, our server showed up immediately and took our wine order and, as I had peeked at the menu online before leaving home I had our appetizer order ready too.  We ordered a shared starter from the top of the small plates menu, \"p.e.i. mussels blistered grape tomatoes, smoked pablano peppers, preserved lemon butter, white wine, grilled ciabatta\".  Cara brought our wine promptly along with a small loaf of fresh bread and some pomegranate butter (which was delicious).  

Now, my wife and I are big fans of mussels and we've eaten them all over the world for many years and I can honestly say that the ones here are the best we've ever had anywhere, bar none.  We both agreed on that and also that it was an appetizer big enough to be shared between two.  They were served with small herb toasted bread in a wonderful buttery sauce that was also great for dipping the bread.  

Then came the main courses;  pan seared scallops served over roasted golden beet couscous, wilted arugula, red beet gastrique, turnip puree for my wife and grilled salmon on top of a cauliflower mash, haricot verts, peperonata, cranberry marmellata for me.  I didn't even know what some of those add-ons were but I can tell you that both dishes were delicious and the presentation was amazing.  If there was a complaint, it would be that there were only two scallops in my wife's dish but they were genuine scallops and large ones at that.  We ordered a shared side dish of the roasted wild mushrooms which were also excellent.  

So, the \"small\" plate of mussels was actually pretty big as was the side dish of mushrooms and even though the mains were a little smaller than we're used to we were both too full to try one of the wonderful sounding sweets from the dessert menu; maybe next time... and there will be a next time, probably many of them if everything is as good as what we had today.  

Oh, and lets not forget... it is, after all, a Napa Valley wine themed restaurant and that is reflected in their massive wine list!  From service (thank you Cara) to ambience, to scrumptious food, it was truly a 5 star experience for us."}
{"text":"We came to Napa on Providence last month for Charlotte restaurant week.  When we parked, we didn't realize we had parked in the restaurant parking lot as we saw the sign on Providence road, not on the actual road they are on.  Would be better right in front of the front entrance of the restaurant.  Someone outside pointed us to thr right way as we looked lost walking in the dark.

The apps we started with were the mussels and risotto balls, both were excellent!  My husband had the salmon and I had the pork chop for dinner.  These also both hit the mark and were very flavorful.  I am a huge sweet person so I was very excited about their dessert offerings.  I had the red velvet cheesecake and my husband had the chocolate torte.  His just tasted like a frozen chocolate cake, nothing homemade, just blah.  The red velvet cheesecake was very disappointing, just didn't get a big taste of cheesecake and the red velvet cake part was dry.  Hate to say it but cheesecake factory has a much better one.  So Napa lost us on the dessert.

Napa overall had some great food, but they need to work on desserts, come on!!"}
{"text":"1 good time out of 3 times pretty bad. My second experience trumped my first! My third and last officially made this a 3 star.

The server makes the world of difference here! 

3rd Time..
Clint our server listened, but didn't check to make sure the order was correct or to check if we liked it. When the entrée came he was ready to pull the salad that wasn't touched due to old brown residue on the sides of each Romaine leaf. The fettuccini Alfredo pasta came out entirely wrong and had to be sent back. The pan seared flounder looked to come out right the first time, but while waiting on the other dish, they re made it, this time a wet gross fish on the plate not seared at all with any flavor. A real disappointment after waiting so long. 

2nd Time..
* I got the same fettuccini Alfredo. Incredible!! Loved it!! 

My first experience..
I enjoyed my dinner once it came, but 3 hrs for dinner is not ok when you've only ordered only the main dish without an entrée or dessert. After eating here, with the food actually being really good.

I informed my waitress that I am a vegetarian. After a long wait my fettuccine Alfredo arrived to the table with meatballs on it. They sent it back and my friend was almost finished with her meal by the time my fettuccine Alfredo came. Unfortunately, no one apologized for the delay, or had any kind of complementary anything to hold me over. I had also ordered zucchini on the side as I wasn't having a protein. It came over cooked and so salty, it tasted like the beach in my mouth. The waitress didn't offer to bring anything else or apologize about that either. 

Bread - the first one was cold, stale, and dry.  After asking the waitress if that was customary, she brought us another that came out hot & much better. The butter is a strange Pomegranate mixture. I wouldn't recommend it. Order some real butter to go along with it.

Fettuccine Alfredo - One of the best I've had, once it was done properly

zucchini - too salty, would not recommend

fish and potatoes- my friend loved her meal!

Dessert - I asked the lady to bring the check and the dessert menu in case I wanted something. She brought only the menu then I had to wait again for the check after I didn't see anything I wanted. 

Hopefully it wasn't just a bad experience due to outside seating. I really wish it was better service!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Sunday brunch and outdoor atmosphere.  The menu was limited but the selections offered were delicious."}
{"text":"We had brunch here with friends and they had reservations, which seems like a must on a busy weekend.  I had the special---smoked salmon frittata with tomatoes and goat cheese. It was excellent and came with roasted potatoes, which were a good match for the savory eggs. I liked the bloody mary cocktails --nice salty flavor. Also liked the pumpkin bread that came as a free appetizer with the meal. We did not have dessert but I bet they are yummy.  The parking lot is over behind the building and the decor is polished wood with cool light fixtures.  You would not know from the building wall that faces Providence Rd.  I would love to try their wine list sometime and dinner too."}
{"text":"This place is very busy and I highly suggest making reservations on the weekend. Lastnight was my 3rd visit here and this visit was a mother & wives night out to WINE  I mean whine down (or do I ). 

We arrived about 5 minutes before our 7pm reservation and the parking lot was jammed pack. People were parking in the bank drive through across the street which we almost resulted to unknowing if we would be towed or not (very unsure still m), however I did two more laps around the block and parking lot only to luck up on a front door space as there was a groups of women leaving. We entered and the hostesses were very welcoming and complimented me on my shirt and escorted us to our table which was sitting RIGHT out in the forefront of the floor where everyone who comes in and out of the dining area would walk pass us. We immediately made mention that we prefer a booth and she moved us to the booth about 3 booths in which was perfect for our girls night out.

Our eyes went straight to the wine list and our friendly and honest server Andrew drew our attention to the Matchbook Tempura that is served on a carafe. He provided us a taste of it and we were very pleased and asked for the large carafe. For appetizers we ordered the meatballs (the other ladies eat pork and such so they had this item, I'm a pescatarian) , mussels and calamari.
Meatballs - The ladies were almost licking the plate as they said it was extremely tasty and they were SOLD on this restaurant as they hadn't been here before.
Calamari - Extremely tasty the crust was seasoned to perfection and the peppers crispy was a perfect compliment not to mention the dipping sauce.
Mussels - This item came out extremely cold initially which was very unpleasant and it took us a good while to get our server attention to send it back for a hot order. He was very busy and as I mentioned earlier very friendly so nothing personal. Once we got his attention and sent the mussels back the manager brought out the warm ones and they were sooo good. 
Problem was, since it took so long to get them sent back and then recooked our food ended up coming very very close to us getting the new set of mussels. That's NOT COOL and the manager could've made mention that our food was coming right afterwards or offered compensation for the mussels that we couldn't give much attention since they were not served with the appetizer portion of our evening.

Our main courses were also phenomenal:
I had the pecan crusted Flounder which was superb 
One of the ladies had the salmon and when I tell you she had nothing left over I mean it. The other lady had the second pasta on the menu which she said was unexplainable in awesomeness. We ALL LOVED our food. 
This is a must do.."}
{"text":"I drive by this place every day and decided to try it for restaurant week.  It was amazing.  Not only was everything delicious but our server Eric was epic.  He talked through wine preferences and had suggestions that we each loved.  I appreciated that the items on the restaurant week menu were the same as the everyday menu.  The portion sizes were perfect as we both left full.  I had the mussels which were delicious and my boyfriend had the potato leek soup.  The soup had bacon or ham in it and was full of different textures and flavours. For the main dish I had the shrimp and steak and he had the pork chop.  They were both so good that we wouldn't share.  :)  I can't wait to go back it.  It was like a little taste of California which I miss since moving out here."}
{"text":"Perfect for privet parties, lunch or dinner with friends. Great drinks. Nice salads and the have heavier items as well. Parking could be a problem at peak times but worth the trouble."}
{"text":"Napa on Providence was a restaurant I was looking forward to visiting ever since I had pre-dinner drinks there back in October of 2017. We stopped in for a cocktail/glass of wine before another dinner, and just off that it stayed on my list.

I finally got a chance to go back on a Friday night after making an OpenTable reservation. It was a nice night so we elected to sit outside underneath one of the umbrellas. It was nice being outside because you feel like you're apart from the hustle and bustle of the inside but don't feel like you're too far away from service.

Unfortunately, I don't remember our server's name, but I do remember she was fantastic the whole night. She was able to offer both food and wine recommendations, and was quick to get us what we asked for.

We all got some wine/cocktails and when those arrived, our server also brought fresh bread. Bread was deliiiicious (and endless) and came with a really tasty pomegranate butter. It was a little on the sweet side so I can see why not everyone would enjoy it, but I thought it was a fun twist on normal butter.

We started off with the arancini balls and a charcuterie plate. The arancini balls were some of the best I've had! They came out piping hot, cheesy, and crunchy AF. They didn't skimp on the sauce that came with it, which is always appreciated. It came with 5 large balls which was generous! I'd say this is a must get if you're a lover of fried cheese and tomato sauces. The charcuterie plate was kind of \"eh\" for me and didn't have the variety I'd expect of a place called \"Napa.\" Not worst, but certainly not the best. 

There were 3 or 4 options I struggled with for an entrée, but eventually went with the beef filet with veal demi, fried potato cake and asparagus. I'd give this dish a 4/5 because the filet, demi, and asparagus were on POINT. Cook was perfect, asparagus was still crisp, demi was super flavorful. The only downfall was the fried potato cake. I'm not sure if it was just how it was prepared but the potatoes tasted pretty undercooked. The outside of it was crunchy, but biting into it, it felt like the potatoes could have used a few more minutes. Other than that, a delicious dish!

If you're looking for a place to come on a summer evening to have a nice cocktail, wine, or a few bites, you'd be well served to try out Napa!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I went to Napa last Sunday for the first time!  Our waitress was wonderful, the chicken and waffles was delicious...and the bottomless mimosas for $12 didn't hurt either :)"}
{"text":"I will start by saying that nothing was in particular wrong it just wasn't very good. The server we had was very sweet and was on top of everything which was great! The food was really just ok- the menu is very small and very generic. It basically is Providence Cafe with a makeover and not a very good one.

 We ordered The Pork Belly with ginger slaw and that was ok the Pork could've been crisper on the outside and the slaw was with like a sweet and sour sauce but overall not bad. We also had the Pulled pork pizza and that was alright lacking in flavor and a little chewy. Then had the Bucatini and that was good and we also had the steak special and I liked my steak it was cooked to the right temp and had good flavoring the Fries they served it with were NOT good they were chewy and cold like they were cooked and hour before and just left on the side. We had ordered some of the sides my favorite being the Mac N Cheese it was delicious!!  

I wont say I wont be back but I really have no real reason to go here other than the Mac N Cheese so we will see..."}
{"text":"We visited Napa on Providence for my birthday this year we several friends. I wasn't wowed by the food but it certainly wasn't bad, just a little bland. The cocktails were FANTASTIC! The service was a pretty slow but I'll say that was due to our 8 person party."}
{"text":"The old Providence Cafe finally has a refreshed interior as well as menu. Have tried this place two times, neither anything to write home about. The service is sub-par. No attention to detail and generally doesn't even get the basics (long wait to be greeted and get water at the table: salad plates linger after entrees arrive; server unsure how to answer some basic questions on the menu etc.). A nice spot for a change of pace but at this price you may consider other options after one shot."}
{"text":"Very good place.  A nice variety of appetizers and nicely prepared entrees. Went there with a group of colleagues from work.  Outdoor seating was a plus."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent for a first date. The staff is very friendly and the food is good, the prices are reasonable and great music!"}
{"text":"They serve water in metal cups which was odd because it throws off your palate. For a place focused on the wine experience that's a faux pas.  Who wants the taste of metal on their mouth just before sipping a new glass of wine? Easily remedied though by an extra wine glass for water.

The charcuterie didn't have as much variation in flavor between the different meats as I've experienced at other places.  I would give it three stars as an appetizer.  Needed a lot more bread crisps to go with it as well.  They gave us 6... You don't just eat it plain because it's so heavy.

I had the filet and it was cooked perfectly.  The wine reduction was great.  French fries are also super tasty, a small portion that keeps you wanting more.  I wasn't crazy for the haricot vert but that's because I don't like undercooked green beans and they're always like that.  

Our waitress raised my review a star.  Would definitely go back to try more on the menu because of the ambience and service was excellent from start to finish."}
{"text":"Not the best. My short rib hash had very little meat... my husbands eggs weren't prepared correctly... the French toast had no strawberry sauce ... :( but the place is really pretty, service was good too. But isn't it about the food."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday Brunch and it was fabulous! We ordered the pizza special of duck confit with roasted cherries, and took the managers tip of drizzling some of their \"pig sauce\" on it, awesome. Also had the lobster Mac n cheese and bananas foster waffles, which were equally amazing. Service was perfect. Cannot wait to return for dinner!"}
{"text":"My mom came to this restaurant on Saturday, what a great restaurant and we are so thankful they were open on Saturday lunch ( we tried a few restaurants and they were all close because they open only dinner time) we were starving because not her or I had anything to eat all day. So we got there and the staff were very friendly we got sit and gave us water and a complementary bread made in the house it was good, then we order drinks my mom got the cucumber  crush, and I got the peach mule, idk how my mom drink was but mine was amazing , delicious shout out to the bartender, then my mom got the carrot  ginger soup OMG it was heavenly creamy warm soup, that one have 6 stars , then we order the the fig pizza it was delicious flavorful and crispy, if you looking to have like a plate of food or pasta this isn't the place, I was looking for a pasta plate on the menu and they only have it a dinner is I'm not mistaken, anyway the pizza was good , good to share between 2 but if you are 3 you will have to order more, the server idk his name but he was very nice tall guy, dark hair well dress he looked very good, you got 5 stars   from me!"}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place for awhile so we decided to host my sibling bday here. The food was 6/10. It wasn't like \"ohhh wow this is so amazing\" but it wasn't like \"I wouldn't give it a second chance\" either. 

Maple leaf farm duck duo and lobster Mac and cheese are probably my two fav out of everything (we ordered the whole menu LOL). I'm not a fan of Mac & cheese but it was very good. The duck duo was worth the money. 

Pros: Plenty of parking spots. Wine list is on point. (I got Hill Family Estate and Luna Vineyards). The entrees are big portion. Lovely atmosphere and decors. 

Cons: despite having a reservation, we waited 20' still. The table was nowhere near ready. The entrance was confusing. 
We have 2 waiters. Our first waiter (Maybe:Clint) was amazing. He was nice, attentive and thoughtful. He has good suggestions for wine. 
Can't say the same about the busboy though. We were full after small plates so we only took a couple bites of our entrees. Most of us wanted to take home the rest.He took our dishes so fast without asking if we were done. Mind you that I was still in the middle of eating my dinner. At first, I thought he was going to put the food in the box but false alarm. He threw away all of our food...."}
{"text":"Came for brunch and I will return again! Thankful the brunch bill passed, so I can enjoy bottomless mimosas without judgement! 

I met with about 25 foodies to celebrate @intensediva23's 3rd anniversary of her monthly culinary adventure \"Foodies & Fellowship\". This is her favorite restaurant and I see why.  The service was fabulous and although we got rather boisterous with laughter, they didn't try to diminish our excitement. 

I ordered the crab risotto cakes with potatoes and poached eggs. I've never eaten a poached egg because...well it's runny and eewww. But I was pleasantly surprised. I think the risotto cake could've been bigger or a third cake added to the plate. I wasn't full and felt something was missing. Yes, it's small bites and I could've ordered another side, but with that many people I didn't bother. The biggest hit was the chicken and waffle. But, I wanted to try something different.  The mac-n-cheese was another hit with our group, so my next visit will be another adventure of tastebuds!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! We ordered Lamb Chops and Risotto( menu special), Scallops and Brussels Sprouts, and a Margarita pizza. All were delicious. Ambience and service was very good. We would definitely return again."}
{"text":"The decor was very fresh and had a definite California-vibe. Everyone who worked there was very pleasant, we were seated and greeted right away. Very cool copper 'mugs' for water - kept the water cold without ice. We had both wine from the 'tap' and also by the bottle.  There is truth to some of the reviews that note the expensive wine - it's not a place to go drink on the cheap, but I'm not sure I would expect to, going to a restaurant whose name features one of the most famous grape growing regions... We had the meatball appetizer, which was delicious on the ricotta polenta cakes. For dinner I had the poulet rouge, some 'rare' chicken dish. I'm not a dark meat fan so I wasn't crazy about the leg, but the breast was well seasoned and well cooked. The vegetables that came with it were delicious as well. Everyone else enjoyed their plates (the duck, the fish of the day, and the pierced pasta). Roy, our server, was very knowledgable and considerate, and made sure to take care of us in every way possible. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood around lunch-time so I decided to stop in to check out Napa on Providence today.  I arrived about 15 minutes before noon and was seated immediately. Since the weather was nice today, I decided to sit outdoors.   

My server brought a bottle of water along with fresh bread and honey-pomegranate butter.  The bread was good and the butter was excellent. For my entrée, I decided to go with the fish sandwich...according to my server, the fish today was flounder.  I asked to sub mac-n-cheese for the fries since I had heard that their mac & cheese was excellent.   Since the mac was a pretty big portion, I decided to just eat the fish and leave the bread. (Even though the bread was tasty.)  Everything was good, and I didn't have any issues  with my meal. I was also happy to see that they only charged a $2 upcharge to sub the mac & cheese instead of the fries.  

On my visit, the service was good, no issues at all. However, this is not a place to duck into for a quick meal... it took an entire hour from the time I was seated until I got my check.  Which is great, if you are not dining alone... but because I was dining alone, it seemed to take forever. 

Still, the food was good, service was gracious, and I would eat here again if I happen to be back in the area."}
{"text":"I keep having to go back here for group brunches.

Pros: bottomless mimosas, menu has a wide variety of options even at brunch, they take reservations, diners are not rushed (with the note, that we have only ever arrived after noon so by the time we are wrapping up no one else is waiting for a table)

Cons: food is still unimpressive, one friend is 0 for 2 on getting served warm fries, the bill always feels higher than the meal experiences warrants"}
{"text":"I drive past Napa on a regular basis, but didn't realize what a great restaurant was nestled off the intersection of Providence and Queens.  Our party of two dined during restaurant week and were surprised to obtain reservations just an our or so before our arrival.  We were immediately seated - directly across from the open kitchen - good for watching the action, but poor in the fact that there was lots of foot traffic and was somewhat loud.  The warm loaf of bread with pomegranate butter was a great starter while we perused the menu.  I simply can't resist hot bread and butter!  Appetizers included the kale salad (great portion size!) and mussles (can't beat the sauce to dip the bread into).  Entree selections included grouper and the pork chop.  Both were good portion sizes, nice and hot (nothing I hate more than food that's been sitting out), and incredibly tasty.  For dessert, we split a chocolate cake with mousse-like icing and a lemon panna cotta.  Both were in great contrast to each other, but by far my favorite was the candied lemon peel and mint syrup with the panna cotta.  Napa truly does restaurant week perfectly - not sacrificing portion size or quality for price.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here on a Saturday morning. Our server, Charlie, was friendly and attentive. They brought complimentary apple breakfast bread which I would love to have the recipe for because it  was amazing. Lightly sweet and moist. 

I ordered the chicken and waffles because I am a sucker for chicken and waffles. It was incredible! I loved the savory waffle combined with the sweet and spicy maple syrup. 

My friend ordered the fig and prosciutto pizza. I sampled it and it was as delicious as it sounds. My other friend had the hangar steak and eggs. I didn't try it, but he had no complaints. 

For $15, you get bottomless mimosas which is an absolute must for any proper brunch. 

All in all, a really excellent time. Will return again."}
{"text":"The wine selection is good, my fig and prosciutto pizza was OK, the service at the bar was slow (despite a slim crowd). I'd be willing to look past all of that, however the way they handled a problem showed a real lack of concern for customer satisfaction that will keep me from returning. I made the bartender aware that I discovered, after I was well into my pizza, there were two paper receipts along with the parchment paper under it (no BS). The manager came over and made a joke about the \"extra ingredients\" but never apologized nor offered to adjust the bill to appease me. It's not about the money per se but I believe the way businesses address problems when they occur (because mistakes do happen) is the perfect opportunity to build customer loyalty. Unfortunately these folks completely missed it."}
{"text":"The mussels were awesome.  The sauce is so good with bread for dipping. 

Great patio space for a sunny afternoon with a glass of wine. The style of this place is so cute. I love the real Napa Valley and have been many times - so this is a great little spot that makes you feel like you are in the wine country.

The pasta dishes are good and the salads are fresh. Relaxing place to meet the girls or for a romantic date."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Napa and it has greatly improved since my last visit. In fact it may even deserve a fifth star. The service is perfect, it sounds stupid and maybe it is, but even the water tasted great (ice cold and clear). I had their buttermilk chicken salad; dressing delicious and ditto for the greens and chicken. The bread was tasty. I am definitely adding them to my list of go to places for lunch."}
{"text":"We've been living here for a year and go out to eat very often. We always try to find somewhere new (using Yelp as a guide usually!) ... The reviews said this place was very good, so we decided to try it out. Well, I am soooo glad we tried it out. It is hands down, the BEST restaurant we have eaten at since living here. The Calamari melted in our mouths (it's a must have!) and the \"Grilled Chicken Cannelloni\" was to die for. I was so impressed. We will be back soon. I even signed up for their emails which I don't typically do, and they offer cooking classes with their chef. Very cool. Go here - you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"3rd time here.  Heather was waitress.  Did great job.  Whole staff did. Manager even introduced herself.

We shared several small plates.  Started with Rosa wine.  Fried Calamari (was OK). Riesling. Onion soup (slightly sweet flavor).  PEI muscles (creamy tasty sauce) (came with dry, brittle toast-tossed that aside) mopped up with fresh, warm bread roll (Much Better).  Charcutrie: wild boar salami (great), smoked sausage (blah, bland, no flavor), midnight bloom cheese (sharp flavor, only as big as your thumb), dijon mustard, roasted/honey nuts (delicious) w/ dry brittle toast (not used).  Keep the fresh warm bread comin.

We really like Napa on Providence.  A real treat."}
{"text":"Came here with my bestie for dinner!  The meal was awesome and the service was great!  We had the duck and short rib/ steak combo.  The meat was prepared to order and seasoned perfectly!  Definitely adding this restaurant to my favorites in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week. Good date spot and good food! This place huge wine selection as well. The outdoor area looked very nice, next time I go back in warmer weather so i can enjoy their outdoor seating"}
{"text":"5-7 happy hour Monday - Friday

What time was my reservation? 7pm. What time did my friends arrive? After 7pm. Sooooo, with that being said, I missed the happy hour that I wish I had known existed! Next time though... next time... yes, I would recommend dining at Napa again. The venue was cute and I liked the nice touches throughout the restaurant and decor. They have copper mugs for the water. Very cute. Call me simple but I like that. LOL. It reminded me of how some places make moscow mules in copper mugs. 

Anyway, they were hosting a community group in the bar and patio area so it was really loud in the back where we were seated initially, but they accommodated our request and moved us to the front room which blocked out most of the noise. If you read this review and still don't order the Clam Linguini, shame on you. It was absolutely delicious! It wasn't heavy like pasta dishes can be and it was perfectly prepared and seasoned. I remember reading on the menu that there was sausage in it but let me tell you... it's house-made sausage and I would have the chef over to make it at MY house anytime. It was that good! True story, one of my friends had already eaten dinner before meeting us (don't ask me why!) and after just one bite of my food she straight up asked for an order of her own. Yup, she kept on eating (well she had half of it boxed to go) but still. My point is that it was yummy! Two thumbs up for Napa."}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant.   Patio seating was great.  Live music outside and our waiter Michael was the absolute best.   We had the soup of the day chicken and roasted. Potatoes and it was fabulous.   Hanger steak salad was good but would not get again.   Nutella cake over rich for one person to eat but a chocoholics paradise."}
{"text":"I've been to Napa twice for happy hour and was quite pleased both times! Happy hour features wine and appetizer specials that are absolutely delightful (I think the wine was $6 a glass). The first time I went I ordered one of their flatbread pizzas and shared it with a friend as a meal -it was filling without being too heavy and good to the last piece! The second time I went I shared 4 different appetizers with a friend (neither of us ate lunch that day and were starving). We loved everything we ordered, especially the shrimp gnocchi and oysters on the half shell; we pretty much licked our plates clean. I sat at the bar both times and received excellent service from the bartenders.

Napa gets my vote as a great place to have a girls' night!  

I've heard they have an excellent brunch, I'll be giving that a try next & may be upping my rating to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Our server didn't crack a smile the entire evening. When the expediter delivered our cheeses she didn't identify them to us which is always done. It took a very long time for our entrees to be delivered. We had 3 different staff members tending to us yet when our entrees arrived we had to ask for eating utensils , twice and wait several  minutes to begin eating . The duck was very salty and what was said to be couscous had the texture of mashed potatoes but I couldn't see because the lighting on the patio was too dark to see our food."}
{"text":"It was Mother's Day and it was a beautiful day to sit outside. Our waiter was very slow coming to the table but the weather and outdoor setting was excellent. We started with the mussels and fried artichoke hearts were excellent. 
Then we had fig and prosciutto pizza  Lobster Mac&Cheese, stuffed Meatballs and pasta. All were excellent. The Fig and prosciutto Pizza was very salty and the Fig was absent. 
This is my second visit and will return to sit outside again"}
{"text":"Brunch was wonderful.

The gnocchi is a must get. There is so much flavor in the broth. Our favorite by far. 

We also ordered the following in order of our favorites: 
1. Short Rib Benedict - the short rib was very flavorful. 
2. Quiche - so fluffy and light.
3. Stuffed mushroom - cheesy
4. Pappardelle - bland compared to the other but the pasta noodles were fantastic!"}
{"text":"A great date spot. We love sitting at the bar and enjoying the great wine selection and sharing a few appetizers. The prosciutto and fig pizza and calamari are great. Great live music in the bar area.  We always enjoy this customer service at Napa as well!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended as we wanted to stay out of the Uptown area.  Amazing place!  Kelley the bartender was awesome and made our visit the best!  Best drinks, great recommendations and the food was out of this world.  We get like VIPs here!   Fun atmosphere, football on the TVs and never felt unattended.  Put this on your to-do list!   And say hi to Kelley for Chuck from Philly!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, drinks, coffee and service. Bottomless mimosas for $13. The place is beautiful. It was my first time there and I'm planning to go back"}
{"text":"My husband, friend and I grabbed a reservation for brunch on New Year's eve day. Napa opens at 10:30 so that's when we went. 
They offer bottomless mimosas for $16 but my husband went with just one and my friend and I, a glass of the sparkling rosé which they filled to the very top which I appreciate. Mine had something floating in it but not sure what it was (foil or bug?) so I just asked for another glass. Got one, no problem. When you are the first to arrive, you get the fresh bottle! No flat bubbles for me, thank you. 
We were brought coffee cake as a free bite. 
My friend let the server pick her meal since she couldn't decide what to get. She ended up with the hash. Looked great. I had to go with chicken and waffles which comes with spicy maple syrup that is drinkable by itself. Even has extra on the side. 
My husband got the smoked salmon Benedict. Everyone ate all of what was on their plate. 
Tip: if you are craving bacon, get a side and they will bring you like ten pieces. Was enough for the table and then some!"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars in all categories! Sunday Brunch was perfect. Our awesome server, Kevin, made sure we had a great experience. It is rare that I take the time to write reviews but we couldn't let this one go unsaid!"}
{"text":"First time visiting Napa on Providence and I will be back again to check out their Happy Hour and their weekend Brunch.

The decor and ambiance is so inviting as you walk in you are greeted by the hostess, who seats you at the booth. We came around 5:45 PM and Happy Hour was going on full swing with live music. Will definitely be back for that.

Service was exceptional, our waiter Brandon came back to check up on us to find out how the food was as well provided feedback on the specials and the dishes to select from. Extensive wine list with so many options. 

Whole team effort when it comes to staff and working cohesively. Josh, the assistant gave great recommendation on the desserts as well.

They make one mean Cosmopolitan. The first one was more pinkish than the second and they both tasted perfect. Probably, there is more than one bartender at the bar making cocktails and drinks.

Warm bread with pomegranate butter spread. Wow. 

Appetizer- ordered the Mozzarella Stuffed Meatballs. Each meatball was sitting on a crispy polenta cake. Very tasty with the Pomodoro sauce.

The Berkshire Pork Osso Bucco with Israeli couscous was cream and the pork just slides off the shank. The mixture with the diced butternut squash and chestnut gives the sweetness to the couscous.

My friend ordered the Braised Short Ribs with Hanger Steak. He loved it.

Ordered the Red Velvet Cake and the Gingerbread Cake- looked like a chocolate souffle with a scoop of ice cream on the side and caramel sauce. Got my sweet tooth fix and with a cup of cappuccino made my evening so memorable."}
{"text":"Honestly, how you can give you a place with copper-esque goblets just two stars. These incredible drinking vessels are worth a star just for them. I stopped by Napa for lunch and I can say the prices area tiny bit on the high end but not as terrible for a quick lunch. And quick it was. In and out in about an order but with service so flawless it didn't feel that fast. This place is fancy shamncy- in the way that they have a small brush to brush your bread crumbs off the table after your plates are cleared. Try the delicious pomegranate butter on the bread. I had a solid carrot ginger soup and bibb salad. Great location for a business lunch but I won't be beating their door down anytime soon."}
{"text":"We went to Napa on Providence for Easter brunch at 12:30.  They seated us immediately (which on a holiday was just AWESOME).  The service was fast we did not feel rushed.  The chicken and waffles was delicious and a bit spicy (LOVED IT!)...and who doesn't like bottomless mimosas???"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here yet, but the drinks are wonderful. I always ask the staff which wine I should get, they know better than I do. I just describe what I'm in the mood for, and have never been disappointed. I also love their mixed drinks/cocktails, I've tasted quite a few and each was better than the next! I wish they would sell the copper mugs they serve water in, I'm obsessed!"}
{"text":"It has taken me forever to review Napa on Providence! This is by far a staple for us here in Charlotte. It is a go-to restaurant for dinner and brunch. The meatballs and calamari are my go-to for appetizers and you cannot go wrong with the duck duo or seasonal fresh catch or scallop entree. Their menu is seasonal so it changes and it never disappoints!  Our service has never been less than stellar every time! We will continue to go back and introduce friends and family to this gem when they come in town."}
{"text":"I thought this place was excellent, from the decor and atmosphere to the food and wine. We went there for a birthday dinner with a large group and I felt like the servers were on top of it. I ordered the short rib and steak, which was basically meat on top of meat, and it was delicious! Everyone else's food looked great as well. I'm anxious to get back there for brunch. Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"This place had been on my list for over a year and last week we finally decided to give it a try.  I am so happy that we did because I had a truly delicious meal.  The menu is top to bottom excellent and so we decided to go tapas style and just order appetizers.  The Calamari were very well made, on the lighter side, with plenty to share.  The meatballs on polenta cakes were the best meatballs I have ever eaten.  They have mozarella inside and the marinara sauce is quite tasty, but the belle of the ball was the gnocchi with duck confit.  Even if the duck had been absent the gnocchi were themselves fantastic, but the duck wasn't absent, and it too was wonderful.  The place is quite charming on the inside and out.  I would definitely pay a return visit.  As mentioned by some other folks, the place fills up very quickly and the parking is not wonderful, but who cares!  I would have been happy to wait or look for parking, in order to get this high quality food."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant several times and never received service as terrible as I did on my last visit. We sat at the bar and waited 10 minutes to have our order taken, we weren't offered bread or a drink. No one came to our table after we received the food and had to grab a manager to get a second drink and order dessert. The table next to use received the full attention of the weight staff, they were promptly greeted and offered bread and had their drink order taken right away. It so sad that this happened, the manager was the one that had to take our order for dinner and dessert and had to send a server to bring an additional drink. The only polite person was the guy who brought the food. The manager was very nice, and comped our meal and he was very apologetic, he was the saving grace for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible service if you have a large party! Many orders were wrong. Took forever to get our checks when it was time to leave."}
{"text":"We decided to try Napa on Providence for weekend brunch. The ambiance of the restaurant is great and it feels nice/upscale. They have a great drink menu and awesome wine selection. 

I ordered their special of the day, which was a quiche with smoked salmon. I love quiche and smoked salmon, but I was disappointed in the meal. The combo did not seem to go together, it lacked flavor and the texture of the quiche was too creamy for me. My fiance was not crazy about his meal either. Neither meals were bad- they just weren't good, if that makes sense.

With so many great brunch options in the area, I can't see us going back there for a meal. We both thought it would be a great place to grab a drink, though!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and poor service will cause us not to return.  
We were greeted with a smile by the hostess and brought immediately to our table. The decor was modern with rustic hints.
Our server greeted us with little enthusiasm never making suggestions for food nor beverages. 
I ordered a glass of Roth red and my husband threw her off by his coffee order.  She seemed put out by the request of skim milk.
We ordered a Duck Confi gnocchi which was well portioned and savory. It was served by a runner who was pleasant. 
The stuffed meatball capollni was as tasty as a dish served by Olive Garden.  In other words disappointing! My husband's mushroom and zucchini sandwich was good.  His french fries reminded him of McDonald's fries.
We were not offered dessert and when the check came we received a spark of personality from our server...too late...15% tip..."}
{"text":"Happy hour bar and patio menu is fabulous. 5-7pm a listing of cocktails, wines and apps are $5-$7.  I have been several times, and have experienced great customer service except on Monday. My friend and I arrived and sat at high top table for 3, and told him we were expecting a third. I think the waiter took that to mean we would wait for her to show up, so after about 10 minutes I finally caught his attention to tell him we would be ordering food and drink now. He seemed surprised, but really if you had asked, rather than assumed....this could have been avoided. 

Anyway, the food and drinks were great and I love the atmosphere of the bar and patio area."}
{"text":"The hostess and the rest of the staff here was very friendly and engaging. They seemed very relaxed and didn't mind a little conversation. The interior of the restaurant is so beautiful, especially the lighting/chandeliers. Outdoor looked awesome too with fairy lights! The food was great, with big portions. My table got an appetizer, drinks, a nice pasta, and a big pizza for under $40. Definitely recommend for anything ranging from date night to celebrating a special occasion with a small group."}
{"text":"Bottomless Mimosas for brunch

Do I really need to say anything else??

Oh yeah the bread and the honey pomegranate butter???? What?! You have to try it! 

I ordered the pancetta hash. The first time I had it it came with roasted sweet potatoes which gave it such an amazing flavor. There's also a poached egg involved which puts it on my all time favorite breakfast/brunch meals!! 
The last time I ordered this it came with roasted red potatoes. It was good but not as good as good as the sweet potatoes. 
My bf ordered the chicken and waffles which were seasoned to perfection. The waffle was crispy on the outside and just the right about of chewiness on the inside. Another time he ordered the short rib eggs Benedict. OMG!! Frkn amazing!! 

We also shared the key lime dessert once. It was good. Would I get it again? Probably not. I don't know if it was a temperature thing or what but it was a little too warm for my taste. The cake that was layered between the key lime was very good though. 


I can't wait to try there dinner one day. Their presentation is spot on for brunch so I can only imagine the presentation for dinner. We will be back."}
{"text":"OOMMGGG!! This place is the bomb. The food and service are on point and the prices cannot be beat. My BF and I came here while on a work trip to Charlotte. I used to live in Charlotte and was never a huge fan of the food scene here...seems like a lot of Johnson and Wales students who just graduated are Executive Chefs in this town. But not here. After we decided to cancel our ressy at The Palm  ( our usual Charlotte spot due to a family tradition ) we opted for something a little more casual. Well, Napa is an upscale dining establishment with a serious wine list, a wonderful menu that caters to several different dietary restrictions and an ambience that could be found in any major city in the US. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I dined here for Valentine's day. I loved our waiter Eric! He had great personality and awesome recommendations! I really appreciated the wine list by the bottle, it provided a detailed description of the flavors of each wine. That made it easy to jump out of the box and explore. The food was exactly what I would expect from a Napa inspired restaurant. I loved the Napa salad! If you like kale, you must try it! Their oysters were awesome, I can't recall where they were from but they were a tad salty so use the lemon! I chose the seabass which came with a pomegranate puree . I ended the night with a creme brule' trio, vanilla, caramel and chocolate. Chocolate was my least favorite but I enjoyed it!!! This restaurant is farm to table so the menu varies seasonally. Overall, I would come back and try something different each time."}
{"text":"From the beginning, I have heard nothing but praise for this place.  Several friends had already gone and been inordinately pleased.  One of them even ordered off-menu and was thrilled with his experience, so my expectations were high.   I was not dissapointed.   

From the moment we walked in the door, we were treated as invited guests.  The entire staff was warm, attentive and cooperative, our server was clever, well-informed, and charming; the surroundings were beautiful and simple.   We never felt rushed, though we were almost the last customers to leave.  We lingered, savored slowly and absorbed the evening.  

The food was perfect.  The most beautiful oysters I've ever seen.  The baby beet salad was perfectly balanced, lacking nothing, and the roasted mushrooms in the tagliatelle were heavenly.    The hangar steak was almost pretty enough to tempt this vegetarian to cross over to the dark side... almost.

Although we couldn't find room for dessert, they all sounded wonderful, and I am sure we will have plenty of opportunity to indulge in future visits.  The manager dropped by to make sure that our experience was wonderful, spending a few moments making us feel welcome, asking for feedback and suggestions.  I suspect this will become a regular \"after-work wine and friends\" local.  It just feels good.  

On a side note, I decided to save some for lunch today, had it boxed and, of course, left it on the table.  When we were half-way home, I actually turned around for it. To my delight, they saved it for me.  And I'm so glad.  It was delicious.  :)"}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice so far.  The atmosphere really does feel like California (in my opinion).  The first time I sat at the bar and had the bucatini - which was amazing.  Another amazing feature:  wine on tap!  Oh yes.  

During my second experience, I went during the day and service was definitely lacking.  Our server disappeared for 20 minutes at a time.  As they say, when things are slow, servers sometimes slack off.  Even the people behind me were complaining about the service.  However, the $10 bottomless mimosas made up for this.  I had a pizza, which I did not really like.  It was a bit salty and it had sundried tomatoes on it - which I detest - and this was not mentioned on the menu.  Everyone else in my party really enjoyed their food.

Wine list is great.  Menu is great.  Atmosphere is great.  Not much else to say.  I will be back at some point."}
{"text":"I thought this place was mediocre at best. Went during restaurant week I ordered the tomato soup appetizer and thought it tasted like it came out of a jar of ragu. I ordered the grilled chicken pasta dish and it was so bland. The chicken was dry and cut up already (I don't mind cutting my own food) and the sauce tasted like plain alfredo sauce. I had the cookie for dessert and again, super dry and I could've sliced and baked a better cookie.

The atmosphere was really nice though and the service was GREAT. Not sure I would go back based on the prices and the blandness of the food. Maybe I would try something else."}
{"text":"The is was my second time dining at Napa on Providence. The first was just after opening and I was not impressed. So it's been awhile and I was looking forward to giving it another try. They have a great happy hour selection of cocktails, wine and appetizers. Definitely a nice bar area. I am torn on my rating----hard to give 4 or 5 stars when they forgot to put in my food order. There was a party of 6 and something happened to my order, either not put in or the kitchen simply messed it up. Nt much fun to sit and watch the rest of the table eat most of theirs before I received mine. That being said, the pan seared duck I ordered was good. A friend ordered the scallops with risotto - it was really good. Also sampled the eggplant mash that came with someone else's salmon---good as well. They also brought me soup while I waited which was nice but I really couldn't eat it. 
I give the server and manager credit for trying to recover from my missing entree. They comped my dessert---olive oil lemon creme cake---delish!!!
So all in all, I would return. Everyone seemed pleased with their food and drink selections."}
{"text":"This was a great first time experience! There were 30 of us getting together for Saturday brunch and they made accommodations for us. We were all at 2 long tables back to back.

The food was great, the service was great, and most importantly our server kept those mimosas flowing. I couldn't have been happier and more impressed with everything. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Don't know why it took me so long to get over to this wonderful restaurant. Decided to head in for brunch on a Sunday and enjoy their bottomless mimosas to cap off a typical millennial weekend, and we were far from disappointed.

To start from the top; they brought out both their brunch bread which was a sweet raspberry loaf, they also brought out their typical bread with a pomegranate butter which was exceedingly scrumptious.

The mimosas were well balanced and made using an above par champagne. All you can drink for $15 is pretty reasonable as far as charlotte goes.

My friend and I decided to get the steak burger and chicken & waffles respectively. The chicken & waffles were phenomenal and frankly one of the best I've had thus far in the city. The steak burger was good, but I suspect that there are more tantalizing options on the menu (the herb frites these come with it are a different story).

Since going for brunch, I have since gone back in for their 5-7 happy hour where you can get reasonably priced drinks, and appetizers at a steal. Being sat outside on their beautiful patio with a drink and some calamari is an easy way to forget about the work day."}
{"text":"A group of girls and I went for dinner for restaurant week. Three courses and a glass of wine was included for $30!  Total steal if you ask me. For my first course I chose the beet salad which was very tasty. Second course I got the hanger steak and oh my goodness it was yummy! They had four options for dessert so we each got one so we could try them all. None of them were short of amazing!!! Couldn't have asked for a better dining experience there."}
{"text":"Had lunch today. Very nice welcome from the hostess. Our server Ryan did a fine job. Started with wild mushroom soup; robust and tasty. Out of today's quiche, so frittata was suggested as substitute. It was good. My buttermilk chicken salad was very tasty; 2 issues: too much pancetta and the chicken breast portion had a lot of connective tissue. It didn't seem like a chicken cutlet was used."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience here and probably won't go back. I was on a date and that is the main reason I didn't complain to the waiter. The chicken and pasta dish I had was terrible. I guess when I saw mushrooms I should have thought it may have a marsala sauce or mushroom sauce but I asked for no mushrooms and it still tasted like mushrooms. It was really bad. The chicken was not fresh grilled chicken but more like it had been pulled from a rotisserie chicken. It had dark meat in it? The service was good but I just can't comprehend how you mess up a chicken and pasta dish. At a minimum, stay away from the Grilled (it was not grilled!) Chicken Fettuccine dish!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first time going to Napa on Providence and it definitely won't be my last.

First, the restaurant was beautiful.  We started with the calamari, I had the mushroom soup (which was a special last night) and the waiter even brought my boyfriend a seasonal salad just so he'd have a little something to eat while I had my soup.  For entrees -I had the grilled salmon and my boyfriend had the pork chop and both were delicious.  Cooked perfectly and seasoned beautifully.  Great wine selections and the service was impeccable.  

I can't recommend this place enough, it was an amazing experience.  Thank you."}
{"text":"What a great place for lunch, especially in nice weather when you can eat outside, under their pretty red umbrellas. 
Visiting in Charlotte to see the Billy Graham Library and chose Napa because we liked the menu online.    Very Good Decision. 

Food: 4/5 We started off with the complimentary \"charcuterie\" board  that you get on your first visit, when you go to their website and sign up ahead of time. Their charcuterie is a delicious antipasto-like appetizer tray with tasting-size helpings (selections listed on the dinner menu-choose 2 of each from 4 types of cheeses and 4 types of meats), served on a wooden boat with buttered toast, a selection of olives, ground mustard, and their own version of granola. YUM!  This would be a tasty starter with wine at dinner time, too. Our server, Charlie, was very knowledgeable and helpful as we asked several questions about menu items. Warm bread came quickly, with their pink butter. 

Among the selections that were chosen for main entrees, the grilled salmon Cobb salad (excellent), the grilled salmon risotto, and the stuffed meat ball bucatini, were favorites.

Service: 5/5 As mentioned above, our server was pleasant and helpful. 

Facility: 4/5 The interior was clean and spacious, the patio was a very pleasant place to dine on a sunny day. There was no loud music so we were able to visit with friends without noise interfering with conversation. 
Conveniently located in a suburban area. Parking is adequate on one side of the restaurant and there are a few spaces on the other side, too. 

We are thinking about trying the brunch next time we are in Charlotte, or perhaps the happy hour followed by dinner."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite brunch spots in charlotte.  Everything I have had here has always left me very pleased."}
{"text":"Food is stellar but sadly 3 stars due to ridic long wait for our food


Place wasn't even booming, but our food took way too long.  Server said the manager would be over to speak with us, but manager didn't even come over --which speaks volumes!

In terms of the food, some dishes are hot or miss.  

Cheese and meat plate is the way to start.
Tuna tartare is not flavorful.  Salmon Cobb salad was delicious albeit skimpy on the salmon and prosciutto bits were way over done to an uncomfortable hard texture."}
{"text":"Excellent evening at Napa!  The only reason I did not give 5 stars was the noise level made it difficult to hear conversation. However, the food was excellent!  Highly recommend the beef carpaccio and clam linguini with housemate sausage. Yummmm!  We did have reservations which I recommend. The outdoor area for drink service was very California! Olaf did a great job for service. Try them out for sure."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for outdoor dining in Charlotte with a generously sized covered patio on a mostly residential side street. 

Great cocktails and wines. Best Margarita pizza around (thin crust always made to perfection and a cheese combination that is fantastically flavorful). 

I don't love the water being served in their signature copper cups. Looks great but I think it makes the water taste a little off. 

Good place to share appetizers and small plates or to go the traditional entree route. Menu is diverse and always pleases. 

Typically not too hard to get a table and always satisfying."}
{"text":"After seeing the hit-or-miss reviews about Napa, I wanted to wait a little bit to give them time to work out the kinks and get settled.  We visited on a Wednesday night, and the place was pretty full at 8 p.m.  The hostess greeted us immediately, marked our reservation and sat us at a table.  (I think booth is the way to go here since we felt a little on display at one of only four tables in the middle of all the booths.)  

The structure is still the same as when it was Providence Cafe, but they've lightened the place up with cream walls.  I've sadly never been to Napa, but it had the feel of a rustic yet classy vineyard house.  

It took our waitress what felt like a loooong time to get to us, and as nice as she was, her approach was a little too... awkward?  eager?  However, the food was outstanding.  The house made sourdough bread with pomegranate butter was to die for.  Is it wrong to eat butter with a spoon?  We got the cheese plate to start, and it was fine - three cheeses with some honey, marmalade, etc.  For dinner, I got the Pork Pizza, and I'm pretty sure there aren't enough adjectives to describe how delicious it was.  I'm a big fan of roasted red peppers and caramelized onions, and these were phenomenal.  The pizza crust was fresh, and I could taste just the right amount of olive oil.  Fella got the pork sliders (we're big on the pig), and he said they were even better than he expected, which is high praise coming from him.

I also have to mention their magical water glasses.  They appeared to be hammered copper/silver, and for as much water as I poured in them from the bottle they leave on the table, my glass never seemed full... and yet, I never ran out of water.  And sadly, I didn't have any wine, so I'm pretty sure that's not why I thought they were magical.

All in all, a solid experience, and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE a good brunch!  I've been anxious to try Napa on Providence since they took over Providence Cafe.  Being seated 5 minutes before the magical \"noon\" alcohol time on Sunday, we were anxious to get our bloody marys.  At 12:15 the waiter's asst delivered water, but still no bloody marys or my friend's coffee.  Finally got them and the bloody mary was DISAPPOINTING!!  Not remotely spicy even though the waiter's asst asked specifically if we wanted regular or spicy.  After a few sips, I just couldn't take it so I asked to have a fresh one made, this one with some spice.  The second one was slightly better, but still not good.  I ordered the eggs benedict minus ham.  It was just that, eggs benedict without ham, nothing fancy or gourmet, nothing more than I could've made at home.  My friend got the proshetta hash (some kind of diced pork tenderloin) and she said it was ok but she left hungry.  My other friend got the margherita pizza which she said was good.  I wouldn't request to go back, but would be willing to give them a second chance if a friend said she wanted to go.  Disappointing!!!"}
{"text":"I drove 95 minutes for a meal so good I can only describe it as divine. 

The staff is great, very helpful and full of tips. 

Sunday brunch is amazing.   Bottomless mimosas, fried chicken and waffles, the most wonderful parfait & frittata were second to none. 

Tried the mozz stuffed meatballs from their regular menu and it was magnificent on top of the polenta. Gotta try it!!

Great atmosphere, great outside seating, and beautifully located in a tranquil area.

Def worth spreading the word about. Also check out their water glasses.... Copper and stainless steel : )"}
{"text":"This is a letter I sent to the manager at Napa.  Great food, experience, atmosphere..... A must try!

Hello Jamaar, 

I wanted to let you know about the wonderful experience my friends and I received at your restaurant the other weekend.  We chose Napa for my birthday dinner and it was such a delight.  

We had reservations and naturally, there were several members of the party that were running a few minutes late.  We early arrivers decided to wait and have a drink at the bar while the others were arriving. While there, John was a gracious bartender and so attentive.  He brought out a lovely cheese plate. I mentioned that we had not ordered the cheese plate and he stated that it was complimentary.  Minutes later, he brought out an oyster plate.  I asked him if he knew that we were dining because of my birthday and he replied, \"No.\" I told him how appreciative and thankful we were even without knowing it was my special night.      

What great service!  I simply want to applaud your staff for a fantastic evening.  The dinner after our bar experience went just as well."}
{"text":"I had been hearing and seeing this place on my way to work for a long while now. I finally made reservations and headed over here after church for brunch. The outside of this restaurant is beautiful with grape vines lining the path and an awesome patio in the front. We were seated right away and the dining area was crowded but not too crazy. We were seated in a booth but the back of the booth was a little loose and was being moved by the people in the booth behind us which was slightly uncomfortable. Our waiter was attentive and timely but seemed to be in a terrible mood. We ordered coffee and a mimosa. This place has 15 dollar endless mimosas which I definitely want to come back and enjoy some time. We ordered chicken and waffles and the French toast. The chicken and waffles were good but the spicy syrup was a little much to me. The French toast was tasty but one piece was pretty soggy for some reason. They came with bacon and the bacon was phenomenal. We were so hungry I forgot to take pictures. Overall for brunch this place is great for enjoying a nice afternoon and chilling out. I would definitely come back and would love to try dinner."}
{"text":"First time here will definitely go back
Chris the manager greeted us as newcomers and recognized the couple we were with as regulators
Even took care of our table in a very nice way which will bring us back
Clint our waiter was excellent as were the food and wine
Great restaurant will go back as often as possible"}
{"text":"Katrina is AMAZING. She brought my mom and me a taste of the special from the kitchen (a delicious scallop on a bed of saffron risotto), was super pleasant and bubbly, and made sure we were well taken care of all evening. We ordered the marinated artichokes as an appetizer- delicious. Beet salad and napa salad- the kale in the napa salad was SO good. And prosciutto and fig pizza for our main dish. The pizza was large enough for us to split after our starters and such a unique, delicious combination. I can't wait to go back for brunch and also try their desserts soon!"}
{"text":"Went for a nice brunch with the family on a Sunday. I lived close by for a couple years and I never had the chance to go - well I got my fill!

Their brunch is pretty good, the atmosphere is definitely California chic, the wooden accents coupled by the sunlight on a sunny day made me feel like I needed a glass of rose (but not before noon!) 

They make their bread fresh in house and their pomegranate butter is good, though a little too sweet for my taste. All of their brunch menu looked amazing. I went with the short rib benedict and it didn't disappoint. The service was above average for a Charlotte restaurant, but I wouldn't say top tier. I felt like the server was going through the motions; little robotic. This place caters to the Myers Park crowd."}
{"text":"I came to Napa on Providence for restaurant week with four hungry men ready to eat their way through wine country. I assumed this restaurant was California-inspired fare based off their name and some word-of-mouth reviews, but not quite sure it fell into that category...

Anyway, I opted to order off the regular menu. I had the Heaven in a Bowl salad which was delicious (although my waiter led me to believe otherwise...odd). A very good size portion of frisee tossed in a bacon vinaigrette, topped with grilled onions and a poached egg. It was delicious. I also had the pork pizza which was fine but nothing special. 

The boys had the short rib (which they loved, I thought it was fine) and sides of mac and cheese. As other Yelpers have pointed out, this mac and cheese is divine. Big, curly noodles, creamy Velveeta-like sauce, topped with crispy breadcrumbs? Yes.

I'll come back, but probably just for wine and snacks. The atmosphere is cool and the portions are generous. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Neat place. Went for a charity event and they did a great job. The appetizers were great and the service was also. We attended a whiskey tasting event after the dinner and that was fantastic."}
{"text":"Great porch seating and the service was great. The food was very good and the banana bread they give you is out of this world. The peach Bellini's we had were subpar and very expensive, they charged us $2.00 for a splash of  peach schnapps. We were here for brunch and a great menu."}
{"text":"I've been to Napa eight times, but yesterday was my second trip to Napa on Providence.  It's totally not the same, but they share one similarity...both trips were a great experience.

On a Saturday night, this place can be a bit of a scene, especially in the bar area.  On a Wednesday night, it's a bit more tame.  I sat in the dining room and the decor was really cute.  I don't know if it's \"Napa\", but it's a lot of wine stuff that's done tastefully.

The staff there is incredibly friendly.  The waiter last night was very nice in both his service and his recommendations for food and wine.  I went with one of their Cabernet wines on tap, which was pretty good.  There are three sizes, so you can either order a large carafe, a large glass or a small one...perfect for those who are non-committal and just want a taste, or to those looking to drink a while.

The food here is really great.  I've had the cheese plate in the past, and the meatballs are yummy.  Last night, all three dishes were winners.  The Napa Salad has a bit of citrus, pancetta, and a few other fun ingredients.  Score one for the waiter and the kitchen for splitting the salad in the back so I didn't have to!  Next was the short rib ravioli.  It was a very hearty meal of about 5 large raviolis, and they don't skimp on the short rim filling!  Last was the duck two ways.  That and the risotto were both cooked perfectly.

This place is nice, and the prices they charge appropriately reflect the quality you receive.  I don't know if I'll be back here 8 times, but it's going on two of my restaurant lists:  1. Repeats, and 2. Recommendations for others.

Napa on Providence is such a versatile place.  I would totally take my parents here if they were in town, or meet the girls for drinks, or meet a date here for either a small pour or a large carafe depending on how much I like him."}
{"text":"I am one of those annoying people who never goes to the same restaurant twice, but since I moved to Charlotte a year ago I have been to Napa on Providence four times. This place provides an amazing experience without fail. Any time someone is new in town, I will bring them to Napa. Highly recommend for a nice evening out (make sure to make reservations !!)"}
{"text":"I am very particular about going to newer concepts however I was pleasantly surprised when visiting Napa.  I have been twice in 2 weeks and that almost never happens!  The first time I selected one of their pizzas (wild mushroom and artichoke) and for the price I was quite pleased. The second time I was a little for hungry so I ordered the short ribs.  This was an awesome choice.  I've heard a few hit or miss reviews about this place so i figured I'd give it a couple months and this was a wise choice.  Napa is definitely improving and climbing up my list as a local fave."}
{"text":"This is a great looking spot located in the Myers park area. They have a spacious lot for parking. My review is only based on brunch. It was my fathers big 60 so we started his day with a meal before our adventitious planned day. Despite making a reservation and arriving on time the staff didn't seemed equips to handle us. They were scrambling to set up everything and figure out the details. Everyone in my party wanted expresso (latte or cappuccino).  The expresso machine was turned off the previous night as mentioned by the waitress and for some reason it was taking a long time to turn on. So after 45 minutes she noted it was still wasn't on and we could get coffee so we did.  The food was just okay. I had the French toast and it was topped with bacon. They already put the syrup on the French toast so it was super soggy. It was suppose to have some bananas on it and there was literally one piece sprinkled on the last piece. The duck Benedict was okay nothing special. The others in my party ordered the chicken and waffles which were a popular dish. They put a syrup seasoning was syrupy on the waffles. The chicken was fried in fish batter with some kind of corn meal and the oil or grease wasn't good and it left everyone in my party that ate that dish sick. We hung around and talked but, before even leaving the place everyone who had the chicken and waffles were tossing the food up in the bathroom or in the parking lot. Management was informed. Choose wisely."}
{"text":"Great food and beautiful atmosphere. We were super lucky to get a seat at the bar before it got overly packed on a Friday night. Had the most delightful bartender (is that what they are referred to as these days) take care of us. Kelly, was her name and she provided amazing and friendly service. I love the eclectic mix of diners that were there. The wine on tap was a nice touch. The kitchen got a little backed up at one point but the place was packed so that was to be expected, but when the food arrived it was to perfection. I have to say, it's probably just me, but I'm so over the trendy farm to table style of being crammed in next to a stranger in a half booth with no table cloth, listening to my conversation, getting a $30 plate of one single pea placed artfully on top of a piece of salmon type of restaurant where the acoustics are so bad I can't here the server rattle off the specials. Can't I have locally sourced food without all that? But I digress, my point is, I'm in love with this (Napa on Providence) style dining experience that brings us back to a slightly more traditional dining experience while still providing a trendy bar scene and modern dining menu. Win."}
{"text":"Brunch at Napa on Providence and my first visit here. It was bustling at noon so I suggest making reservations. And parking is challenging so plan ahead. Bottles of ice water and choco-chip corn bread served on table (yum!) & a warm, inviting ambience with just enough lighting. 
I asked our server for suggestions and as soon as he said the duck confit eggs benedict I was sold! However, he came back to break the news it was sold out so that'll be for the next time!
I went with the (suggested) short rib hash and poached eggs. There was a good portion of meat, it was tender and topped with 2 poached eggs so the mix of the eggs with the meat, potatoes, onions and red peppers was delicious! For me, there was just alittle too much grease/butter so I asked for bread (to dunk). Apparently they don't have bread pre-made so they baked it, but worth the wait! + a bloody mary= $21 w.tax! 
What a bargain, especially for this quality food!
Friends had salads topped w.salmon and they were very pleased, also.
Will definately go again & sit on the beautiful covered patio!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food and staff. They have a great wine selection. Will be going back."}
{"text":"First time at Napa. I sat at the bar for a glass of wine and to take out. Service was great from the beginning. The menu is limited which is a good thing - that means they can concentrate on the items listed without trying to be all things to all people. They offer small plates including some very nice looking oysters served in individual white porcelain cups. All of the plates I saw coming out of the kitchen were nicely presented. In addition, they have large plates ranging in price from $17 to $24. I chose one of the large plate selections - Poulet Rouge with roasted root vegetables.

So I will interject this: I take out a lot. Some restaurants do a good job and others don't get it. What really bugs me is a nice restaurant putting the entree in a too-large container. The food looks skimpy and it sloshes around on the way home. 

The Poulet Rouge was absolutely the BEST take out meal I've enjoyed lately (and perfectly packaged in recyclable cartons.) The chicken was cooked well done. The entire outside was very crispy but the inside was not compromised. And the vegetables...... ah! I seek decent vegetables at restaurants and Napa has won my award. Perfectly cooked sweet potato, cauliflower and broccoli rabe (I know, not a root vegetable but it fit in the mix.) 

I recommend Napa for sure! It's pricey but my first impression was great. Oh and by the way, as I stood to leave, the bartender apologized for not having the time to get to know me because it was busy.... that was pretty cool. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Possibly the best pasta I have had since moving to CLT from NYC.  Had a mushroom pasta.  Brunch is also very well done.  Croque madame was great."}
{"text":"Here in barbecucentric Charlotte, California cuisine is practically nonexistent.  That is, until Napa on Providence opened in November 2012, taking over the space that Providence Café occupied for twenty plus years, and infusing the Charlotte food scene with a little spice of the northern California countryside.  The vibe inside the remodeled restaurant is polished, warm, and inviting with a large bar area plus an attractive patio.

As the name suggests, Napa on Providence specializes in Californian cuisine, the root of which is fresh ingredients, simply prepared.  Napa takes this tenet seriously-all dishes are made to order, from the sauce for the macaroni and cheese to the outstanding white beans with house-made sausage, which taste like they've simmered together for hours.

Everything is thoughtfully executed, all the way down to the drinking water they distill in-house and the hammered copper drinking glasses they serve it in.  Even the house bread is special.  The rolls are handmade by a retired Navy baker.  They are dense and chewy and served in recycled cork baskets along with pomegranate honey butter.  Once in season, the pomegranates will be harvested from a hundred year old tree at the foot of Napa's patio.

Dinner at Napa starts with small plates, and sharing is encouraged.  The food arrives at the table in rustic cast iron skillets perched upon stark white dishes, and each selection is beautifully composed.  The small plate offerings include charcuterie, both grilled and raw oysters, and several salads.  The meatballs are my personal favorite. Made from a mix of beef and pork, they are studded with small chunks of carrot, stuffed with house-made mozzarella, and served perched upon polenta cakes with homemade tomato pomodoro sauce.

The steamed clams with homemade sausage are very popular, and are served in a delicious salty white wine sauce with roasted garlic, fennel, and slices of charred crostini.  Napa also offers a handful of pizzas, served on house-made dough and topped with fresh mozzarella.  John, the bartender, raved about the pork pizza.  It features porchetta with white cheddar, caramelized onions, and roasted red peppers.  Speaking of John, I couldn't ask for a friendlier more attentive bartender.  His genuine excitement for the food and spirits was contagious.

There are several large plate offerings, each masterfully crafted:  grilled swordfish, halibut, hanger steak, and even a Carolina cheeseburger.  There are two pasta dishes:  the popular lobster macaroni that's made with Velveeta and beer and the bucatini featuring the homemade pomodoro, roasted garlic, and grape tomatoes (which I am dying to try).  A house favorite (as well as one on my personal top picks) is the poulet rouge.  It's a roasted half chicken with a horseradish pan gravy served with roasted root veggies.  Simple, rustic, and delightful.

Each night, there are chef's specials available.  I recently tried the roasted duck with cherry glaze, and as a person who doesn't often favor game, I was very impressed.  The risotto served alongside was fantastic.  It had baby bella mushrooms and whole cherry tomatoes that added little pops of sweetness to the creamy rice.

Of course, Napa is known for its wine, and there is an abundance at the restaurant.  There are nearly 80 varieties available, with bottle prices ranging from $33 to $175, and approximately twenty varieties available by the glass.  At Napa on Providence, the drink specialties encompass more than vino-they also barrel-infuse several liquors, which are featured in handcrafted cocktails.  I tried and thoroughly enjoyed the Napa Manhattan infusion:  Woodford bourbon lightly infused with cherries, vanilla bean, and sweet vermouth.  There are also specialty brunch cocktails, my favorite being the Napa Mimosa, complete with plump pomegranate seeds floating around in the bubbly champagne.  Napa rounds out the beverage offerings with pod espresso beverages and loose leaf tea.

All great meals should end on a sweet note, and the dessert options are quite enticing.   Currently, you can choose between a trio of crème brulee, lemon tart pie, a chocolate duo of lava cake and chocolate pot de crème, or follow my lead and get the warm caramel apple bread pudding, which I somehow managed to devour every last bite of."}
{"text":"An outstanding addition to Charlotte's dining scene, Napa on Providence is a great spot for a romantic dinner, a business lunch, or a night out with friends. My wife and I came in on Valentine's Day weekend, and enjoyed a fantastic meal, some great wine, and excellent service. 

I started with a succulent order of Oysters Rockefeller, followed by an excellent dish of grilled Mahi Mahi. My wife's steak was equally outstanding, and the extensive selection of wine-by-the-glass allowed us to sample some wonderful labels for the first time. 

The location is convenient, the parking free, and the intimate setting perfect for just about any special occassion. We couldn't have picked a better spot to celebrate a special night out, and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had brunch at bar.  Amazing service which is becoming rare in Charlotte.  Bartender was busy so hostess brought menus and manager took drink order.  Food always good and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great casual date night place! I've eaten dinner here several times, been to a baby shower, and even ordered take out---literally everything I've ever had is awesome. I've been very impressed with their cocktails recently too, very well crafted! Must order items include the flatbread, gnocchi, and tartare. Don't worry if there's a wait or you don't have a reservation, grab a seat by the bar (first come first serve), it's just as nice!"}
{"text":"Amazing wine country-inspired restaurant. Felt like I was back in Napa City. Everything was perfect from the wines on tap to the pomegranate butter served with housemade bread to the unique copper water cup. We had shrimp and lemon gnocchi, mozzarella-stuffed meatballs, wild boar sausage flatbread, and braised short rib- all fantastic! This is a real gem in Charlotte"}
{"text":"My friend and I adore brunch and this place is so gorgeous we want to love it but it keeps disappointing us so we won't go back.  First time my friend's salmon frittata had no salmon.  They remade it with salmon and it was burned.  I had the quiche and it was cold and had a weird texture and just too thick - like I was eating a giant slab of bread.  Another trip I made the mistake of ordering the croque madame .  Let's just say it was deli ham from food lion on stale bread.  The portion was overwhelming and not appetizing in the least.  The third or fourth times we went were so unimpressive that I called it quits. Mostly what amazes me is this place is owned by the Pump House people and I love, love , love the Pump House.  Not only is the setting gorgeous but food there impeccable."}
{"text":"Chose this spot to take out of town friends for a boozy brunch. Bottomless carafes of mimosa is always a good call. The menu is huge, lots to choose from, but lots to get lost in. Not necessarily a bad problem to have. I ordered the brisket hash, tasty, but I'll go for something else next time. A friend of mine ordered the pancetta, she agreed it was tasty but will probably go for another item on the menu during our next visit. One other friend others the brioche french toast, can't really go wrong there. We didn't have wine this time, but as the bottomless champagne was enough, but I intend to come back for dinner. At the tail end of our meal, the ceiling began to pour down on us, the staff quickly moved us outside which was nice. Thankfully, I believe it was water, so my white shirt didn't suffer a major loss. I'll return and will definitely be sure to request outdoor seating for my reservation."}
{"text":"I like this place! I happened to be on this side of town shopping and pulled them up on yelp. Service was awesome and the food is great! I had brunch both times and enjoyed the bottomless mimosas! Save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed our meal here with my favorite dining buddy Pete and meatballs to start with we both had salads mine was grilled salmon over Caesar salad Pete had smoked salmon Cobb salad everything was delicious very attentive service. On my next work assignment in Charlotte I will definitely be back I cannot wait to try some of the desserts the menu looks delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a sunny Sunday morning and had really great service. Our server was very attentive and friendly. She was very understanding that it took us so long to order and kept coming back to refill our water bottles. The medieval looking goblets made the ambiance feel semi fancy.  The decor was upscale. You can see the chefs cooking in the open kitchen which was cool. However, the food was not anything special although I cleaned my plate. I got the crab benedict special. The way it was described made me think it was a on a crab cake. It was just an English muffin with crab meat on top. Meh. Everyone else's food looked really good. When I come back, I'll try one of their staple menu items. Overall, nice restaurant with great service. Solid 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Service people were very friendly and accommodating.  

We went for some appetizers and wine with a work group.

We sat outside under their covered patio which worked well when it started to rain a bit.  We were very comfortable on the sofa's.  

The appetizers were delicious, especially the short-rib flat bread.

Would definitely go back here for drinks/apps and maybe try for a full lunch or dinner one time.

I really liked the look of the interior though we didn't stay in there.  Big booths and more intimate tables available.  Very spacious and welcoming.  Nice-sized bar."}
{"text":"My date and I ate there last weekend and had our best experience thus far. After a bit of a wait at the door and being sat at a smallish table in the back room, things just got better and better. Seth, our waiter was incredible. Absolutely professional. His wine knowledge was impressive and steered us into a wonderful blend I had never heard of. Then there was cheese for us! We took all of his recommendations and enjoyed everything thoroughly. We will definitely request him next time we eat there."}
{"text":"Happy hour on a Wednesday night. 6pm
Calamari is always how I judge a restaurants apps. This was good but extra salty, and I like salt!  Fried artichoke hearts, good but same issue.   average at best. And the sage gnocchi off the regular menu was a big bomb!
All three of us love  gnocchi and duck, so when the luke warm plate arrived and the \"broth\" sauce was a complete disappointment. Sad to say... 

Charles, a good bartender, and as attentive as he could be with as busy as he was. I had to whiskey sours at five dollars apiece it made the stop worth it. And fresh hot bread and pomegranate butter was very yummy!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant in the Myer's Park area. I've been maybe 4-5 times in the past year, and it's always great. Good selection at the bar and a very yuppie atmosphere (not a bad thing). Fantastic place to go on a dinner date with your significant other, or to meet up on a date for drinks. On to their dinner selections, very fresh ingredients and prepared well...they have an open kitchen so it's fun. Host and wait staff very friendly and accommodating. Try the arugula and Gorgonzola pizza...AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing time there the other night. They had a bunch of local brews on tap.  I had my favorite Olde Mecklenburg Copper along with some amazing apps during happy hour."}
{"text":"Great brunch! Very flavorful menu and bottomless mimosas for $13. My pancetta hash with poached eggs were cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend.  We sat at the bar because the restaurant was super crowded for lunch.  

Our waitress was so friendly.  We ordered the Napa salad to split and the fig and prosciutto pizza to split.

The salad took a while to come out and the overall portion was small for the price or this would be a 5 star review.

The pizza was perfection .  It was flavorful crispy and not greasy.  

I will be back for lunch for sure!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim, with no reservation (actually we rarely make reservations anywhere) and were surprised that they took us - the parking lot was packed.

The atmosphere of Napa is great, very welcoming. The staff too. Overall an excellent vibe, the only thing that is a bit odd are those water... cups? Goblets? Grails? I don't even know what to call them. It's not that they are bad - they look interesting, they are just different. The cool thing is that they give you these old-time looking glass medicine bottles so you can keep them filled yourself. I guess it's a good idea, since it's hard to see if there is any water left.

Regardless, the menu looked interesting, to match the decor, so off we went. The lunch menu on its own looked good (the ricotta gnocchi specifically was really tasty), so off we went on the brunch menu. Loved that the server suggested something, and also that the sides, in this case the potatoes, were seasoned. Too many times they go without even something as simple as a bit of salt.

On the bad side, the rest of the meal wasn't nearly as good as the potatoes. It wasn't bad, it's just that they didn't work. The frittata was essentially an egg with stuff on it, and the benedict had the flavor, but the textures just didn't work together, ending up in a mess on the plate rather than a nice bite.

Still, if you're in it for the decor and the experience - and that gnocchi - definitely a great stop."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Napa on Providence for a friends birthday, so we went with a pretty large group. This really gave Napa the opportunity to shine from a service standpoint and they did. The water glasses were always filled, the service was pretty fast considering that we were a large group and the people.

The food was great and very well priced for what it was. Being that it was Sunday before 2:00 my wife and I ordered off of the brunch menu. She ordered the Napa Benedict, and I ordered the Herb Fried Chicken and Waffles. My wife's Benedict was amazing, the eggs were poached to perfection, and the hollandaise sauce tasted amazing. The herb fried chicken was to die for. It really was some of the best friend chicken I have had in my life. It was crunchy, moist, and very flavorful. The waffles were great as well. My only complaint was that I do not believe that there was enough syrup provided for the waffles. 

Now to the one down part about the meal, the drinks. Although the drinks did taste great, they were almost your typical drinks that you can get at other Charlotte restaurants. My wife and I both started with pomegranate mimosas, they were what you would expect from a mimosa. After one I switched to a beer and had a big boss beer which comes from a brewery in Raleigh which I am very familiar with. The beer was exactly what I would expect from the beer. I have had it several times before having went to college in Raleigh. The biggest problem with the drinks though is their price. For what you get the drinks are very over priced. My beer was $7, the most I have ever seen this beer charged for anywhere else was $4, and the mimosa's were $8 a piece. Really expensive when you think that at other places in Charlotte bottomless mimosa's are $10. I know that it isn't a fancy one like a pomegranate mimosa, but still, the mimosa was not that impressive. Other drinks that were on their menu had a higher cost than the food. I under stand a great wine costing that much but the drinks that were $10 or more I just didn't understand. 

Overall the experience was great and I loved the food. I am very likely to return to Napa again, but probably not likely to drink there."}
{"text":"Well....My daughters and I decided to try out a new place. I wish we hadn't .

My Pinot Noir was great. One of my daughters had a pizza and it was tasty. The problem we had was the Napa Short Ribs were good but came with a long hair on the plate.

I pointed this out to the waiter and she was very apologetic. She removed the plate and offered to bring out the same entree. 

Manager came by and was very sorry to hear about the stray hair.

I was very disappointed that they did not comp my daughters meal.....Or at least offer to comp a portion of the meal in a situation like this."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and I always enjoy it. A great place to go out with friends as there's plenty of seating inside and some outdoors for the nice nights. I'm not overly impressed with the food as there's nothing that stands out taste-wise. But it's not bad - 3.5 stars. They have a new fall menu supposedly, so you may be able to try something different. The bourbon apples on the squash pizza was a good mix of sweet and bourbon. The pots-de-creme was also a delicious dish overall, but needed more of it on the plate!

The mixed drinks are pricey but good and the beers are reasonably priced for the setting and atmosphere. The service we received from the staff supervisor who waited on us during a non-busy Saturday evening was excellent - 4+ stars. Answered all of our questions, made honest suggestions, and overall helpful. I'd return for another nice evening for date night or dinner with friends."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Great food, Great wine, awesome happy hour and an enthusiastic staff. 
Read the negative reviews carefully.They are insane. 
Lets focus on what's really important at a restaurant....if you are looking for a great meal and atmosphere you will find both here."}
{"text":"The focus at Napa is quality food and California wine. Can't get a whole lot better than that. I've been for lunch and dinner. At lunch I go with either the chicken or steak salad. I love the pickled onions on the steak salad and fried onions on the chicken so it depends on what protein, and yes, what onion I'm in the mood for. 

Lots of great options at dinner and I feel the food is always fresh and the menu changes seasonally which I appreciate. You can't get bored going back time and again."}
{"text":"Went here for Christmas eve dinner.  Had a 7:45 reservation and we were sat in the back room even though there were plenty of tables open in the main room.  Only 5 tables in the back and you feel like you're at the kids table back there.  No ambiance whatsoever. 

We started with a carpaccio and the description on the menus says 'mustard greens, pickled red onions, overnight tomatoes, horseradish cream, toasted ciabatta, crispy capers'.  Well, there were no capers or red onions and worst of all the meat was brown.  Strike 1.  Next I had a hanger steak and braised short rib entree while my wife had beef tenderloin.  They were both disappointing.  The hanger steak was OK, the short rib was tasteless.  Strike 2.  Cubed sweet potato was underneath it.  Really, cook a sweet potato and dice it up...blah. Strike 3.  My wife had risotto under her tough tenderloin.  The risotto was watery.  The descriptions on the menu sounded really good but the results were no where close.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Food average, service average, wine price 3x retail store, I believe in under promise and over deliver. Napa gives below expectations. 1/2 of our group said they won 't last 3 months. Nuff said."}
{"text":"I have been to Napa about 5 times for lunch and dinner. I see some questionable reviews on here but I love this place!

The service is friendly and attentive. I love the remodeling and the water glasses are hammered metal. It keeps your water nice and cold without ice! It's a very modern farmhouse look. I really like it.  The food and atmosphere are a major upgrade from the former Providence Café.

This is what to get:

ALWAYS, I don't care if you are just here for a work lunch, start with the grilled oysters on the half shell. These things are buttery (ohh yeah) garlicky, and with a hint of cheese.  They are incredible. 

The mozzarella stuffed meat balls are also money.

Here I go again-feel free to mock me as a salad eater but they have the best entree salads.  I love the seafood Cobb with crab (and lots of it), pancetta, avocado and goat cheese.  It is so flavorful.  The grilled shrimp salad is also incredible with its little crispy onions.  These are flavor packed salads that will fill you up and make you smile. 

Another things I like is that they infuse a lot of their own liquors.  I had a delicious black cherry bourbon on the rocks that was incredible. 

I noticed on their brunch menu that they offer chicken and waffles.  Ok maybe now I can convince my husband to go to next weekend!"}
{"text":"A group of 10 of us tried this place for the first time last night for restaurant week and we all enjoyed everything!  The main hits of the group were the hanger steak,  shrimp gnocchi,  beet salad, bone in pork chop and the cheesecake.  The service was wonderful as well. 
They do have a cute little outdoor seating area which I would like to go back for.
Because of restaurant week we tried this place and because of all the good food and service they now have 10 more people that will be customers. 
Thanks restaurant week and Napa on providence!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is so fresh and well prepared and the service is perfect! The staff was polite and attentive. Our server Josh was the best! Love the chef as well. Mike Griswold does amazing work in the kitchen. Everything dish that came out was better than the last. I'll definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I know it's restaurant week, but when we arrived for our 6:45 reservation the place was only half full. At 8:10 when our entree arrived I was already feeling a bit irritated as i watched the table beside us who arrived 30-45 after us already eating their entree. I took one bite and the food was barely warm. Now I'm just done with the whole business and told the server to box up my dinner to go. This is only the third time in my life I've sent something back. What I did eat was good, but the experience as a whole was a bust. Waitress fault? Kitchen fault? I don't know. Can't say I'll be returning"}
{"text":"I had such a nice time here this past week when I stopped by.  My boss and I got a bottle of wine and a few apps to eat.  The wine was great and the chef sent out a complimentary cheese and bread plate which was delicious.  The restaurant was clean and the vibe was really relaxing.  The bar tables are a little awkwardly shaped - so we ended up sitting in the dining room. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I struggled with the rating. This is a beautiful restaurant, with ample parking (it makes it SO much easier).
The hostesses were super cute but not ditzy-cute- friendly and engaging. 
I think our server was in training but it was obvious she was only new to the restaurant, because she understood nuances that a newbie server wouldnt. Both she and her mentor were friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. They contributed to an enjoyable evening. 
So, I'm gushing - so why only three stars? Well, the food was... ok. 
We started off w a half- dozen roasted oysters. The were covered w parmesan then probably were put under a broiler(?). The parmesan overpowered the oyster and I couldn't taste it. Perhaps less cheese? And, because the cheese melted over the sides of the shell, it stuck to the rock salt. NOT a pleasurable taste to put a piece of rock salt in your mouth. 
We shared a beet salad that was the best bite of the evening. The arugula was refreshing, and it was dressed perfectly. The beets had a great flavor but could have benefitted from a little more carmelization.
We then shared a charcuterie board. Chorizo, blue cheese, and duck ham. The servers raved about the duck ham. When I said I'm not that crazy about smoke flavor, they both said it was not smoky. 
It was VERY smoky and the thick band of raw fat around it made me gag. The chorizo was good, the blue cheese was okay. The board came with two big chunks of granola that.could only be eaten by picking them up and biting off a piece. No way to do that graciously. 
Admittedly, we did not try any entrees, but we really don't eat that way. The small plates have to represent too!
Because we had such a nice time (kudos to the staff) we will probably come back and give a few other.menu items a try."}
{"text":"You must go here! Now one of my favorites.  The menu is unique and creative. I'm a foodie and was very impressed even with the pizzas. I had the Fig and prosciutto Pizza and the salmon salad and they were amazing. Great place for small groups , families and couples. The pricing is reasonable and the atmosphere is good. Could be a little loud at times but definitely bearable. We were there on a Friday night so it was a little more active than usual. Love this place! Can't wait to go back.

They take reservations, so if you don't want to wait, make sure you call of use own table."}
{"text":"More like a 3.2, but rounding up to 4 due to the good-looking hh/bar scene. (Self included!)

Stopped by Friday following Restaurant Week.  Really neat looking place, and one of few, if any, places that have wine on tap.  Wine on tap is legit.

Mozarella Stuffed Meatballs - This dish gets a :}  The meatballs were pretty good, but it was served with POLENTA as well.  \"POLENTA\" is in caps, because there was way too much of it.  Conversely, \"Stuffed\" is an exaggeration.  This dish would get a normal :) but clearly there's an abundance of POLENTA dripping down my face; hence the :}  

Margherita Pizza - This pizza gets a :[  Maybe it was our fault, and let it sit while eating and drinking and talking.  It wasn't all that great because it got cold pretty quick.  Average.

Shrimp with Gnocchi - This dish gets a :\  Tried a little of the shrimp which was plump and fresh and joined in the flavors of the dish quite well.  The gnocchi was still dough and incredibly heavy because of it.  If only I didn't have to keep chewing my way through the gnocchi I would be smiling fully instead of the :\

Really good ambiance.  A bit slow and a bit inaccurate on service, which is slightly disappointing bc we told the bartender to bring out the dishes as they're ready.  Instead, all the dishes came out at the same time.  Can tell meatballs should have been quicker given the guests nearby who ordered it as well.  

If I'm in the area, I wouldn't mind coming back to grab happy hour.  

dmo out."}
{"text":"This is really great spot! It felt cozy and the food was pretty good - it was perfect for our family lunch! They seem to have a solid brunch menu, so I can't wait to go back and try that out! I am sad that I came during the winter months because they had a beautiful patio that I can only imagine would be pretty awesome during warm months to enjoy!"}
{"text":"I cannot recall a more decadent meal. My husband and I came to have lunch and celebrate the kids being back in school. We ordered the shrimp and lemon gnocchi to start and my oh my was it one of the most amazing dishes we've ever enjoyed! We ate every single bite. My husband went on to order the pan seared salmon while I had the fig and prosciutto pizza. We literally devoured every bite of that as well. In between, we ordered a couple beers, the infused gin cocktail and a glass of rose. The gin cocktail. Get it. When it came to dessert, we literally couldn't decide out of the four, so the amazing bartender, Kevin, who took care of us today,  convinced the kitchen to give us half orders of dessert so we could try it all. Again, clean plates. This place has been on our must try list for a while but today we made it happen. We are more than fulfilled and satisfied.  We are delighted."}
{"text":"I hope that this review finds the managers and staff of Napa in great spirits!  Starting at the door, where the experience begins, the hostess greeted myself and my guest with a smile. We were directed to the bar where we chose to sit and enjoy. Amanda was our server, and we were highly impressed from beginning to end. She recommended a great wine, which is was very knowledgeable about and apps for us. The fig and prosciutto pizza was phenomenal!  I wanted to order a second one, but I didn't want to seem like a cow if front of my female guest. The calamari was crisp, hot, and very tasteful. I was blown away not only by the ambience but the food and service! Kevin and Amanda took excellent care of us, treated us like royalty,  and always served us with a smile. All of those elements are very rare in restaurants these days. My friends and I eat out a lot, and these are the experiences we look for and recommend. I can't thank you enough for investing in detail and quality. My friends, family, and I will definitely be back! 

Sincerely,

Your new Regular-Degular"}
{"text":"AWESOME brunch. Went with a group of 4 yesterday, and we all tried different things...the lobster Benedict was my favorite hands-down. Poached lobster and tobiko on an eggs Benedict? Soooo good! Also the service was great, and she kept the mimosas coming at a perfect pace."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but a few things to be aware of. The service isn't great, the wine is very overpriced - even their wines \"on tap\" are about $12-$15 per glass.
Although the food was good I'm not sure if I would go back."}
{"text":"This is the place to be on Sundays for brunch!! Our waiter Eric was awesome!! The beet rosotta was excellent!! And the bananas foster was out of this world!! The girls and I had a ball!! We will be back next Sunday for my birthday brunch!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat out most nights, so we have tried many restaurants in Charlotte. I had been to Napa once before and thought it was fine but not great in any way. We wanted to give it another chance so my husband and I took our daughter here last night during restaurant week to celebrate her birthday. I ordered the salmon, she ordered the trout, my husband ordered the meatballs (not on the restaurant week menu).  Everyone's food was fine. Nothing was great, nothing was bad, everything was just....well...it was okay.  Our bill for the three of us was nearly $140 including tax, tip and two cocktails.  For a meal that was \"fine\" I'll go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was great. Nice ambiance. Loved it all. Sunday brunch bottomless mimosas from 12-2"}
{"text":"Always had exceptional service at this restaurant. Very nice crew and manager.  My food was delicious, I loved it every visit.  I would recommend to anyone for a nice date night. Food is a little pricey, but very well worth it. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Visited here for a friend's birthday dinner. Had the lobster ravioli, which was just okay. Friends who had pork chops had a revelation that she doesn't like chops. Calamari was tasty. So was the risotto. The waitress allowed us to order drink specials that were listed as only available at the bar. That was a plus. Service was quick, friendly, and attentive. I'm inclined to recommend doing happy hour, but skipping dinner. I'll come back for dinner and try something else to be sure. Based on price (avg. $25 entree), I expected more."}
{"text":"Perfect Date Spot!  Hidden gem in Charlotte with amazing wine and food. Great to try during restaurant week.  Salads are refreshing, especially the Roasted Beets Salad.  The steak and risotto entree was the best!  The chocolate trifle cake was delicious.  Definitely returning to this place soon."}
{"text":"Pros:
Great wine list
Good cocktail list
Great happy hour! (Deals on limited appetizers and drinks from 5-7, Sunday-Friday)
Parking 
Friendly staff
Great patio
Great brunch with bottomless mimosas 

Cons:
Don't order the pizza.. it tasted like frozen pizza 

This is a fun, more upscale while still being semi-casual spot!"}
{"text":"Stopped in this week for a business lunch. What a great experience! The staff was friendly and helpful. I ordered the grilled salmon Cesar salad. The salmon was on point!! My colleague ordered the grilled chicken salad and said it was fantastic. Her plate was empty so I'm guessing she was telling the truth. Ha! Look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Sooo the duck benedict. There isn't much I can say other than EAT IT. I'm not a fan of poached eggs, but our server (who was absolutely AMAZING) suggested getting it with scrambled eggs. That was probably the best decision I made that day. I loved the atmosphere, her excellent knowledge of the menu, and she was great in terms of making sure the bottomless mimosas were flowing. And the banana bread was great. I can't wait to visit Charlotte again to come back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Napa on Providence several times and it is always a great experience. I've even booked the larger room to host an event and it too was a pleasant experience. I recommend going for brunch and the $12 bottomless mimosas!"}
{"text":"Came in town for a conference and needed to find a restaurant with real food and a bar tv to watch the baseball game. Napa was recommended by our hotel. Wish we had known about it sooner. Food was delicious! We had the swordfish and pork chop and loved them. Best meal we had during our visit. And the staff was super friendly. Let us stay past closing while they cleaned so we could watch the game. Thanks, guys!"}
{"text":"First visit to Napa and will definitely not be my last. Having Pride Brunch with a few good friends and having moved from NJ/NY, unlimited Mimosas with brunch is the only way to brunch . What a great experience from the service to the drinks and then the food. 

Ordered the blueberry French Toast, a fried had the chicken & waffles. The French toast was cooked extremely well and they accommodated having my eggs scrambled instead of poached. My friend had an issue with his chicken/waffles coming out cold which Napa quickly recooked. Unfortunately, on the recook the chicken was overcooked and hard which Napa removed from the bill and was again accommodating in wanting to serve us something else.

Overall, great experience and I look forward to trying Napa for dinner and hosting many brunches with friends in the near future. A++ from start to finish even accounting for the chicken/waffles. 

If you're looking for the best brunch spot in town, check out Napa you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My new favorite place in town! I cannot wait for the weather to get warmer, so that we can sit out on their patio and enjoy their delectable food and fabulous wine!

Been there three times in a three week span, and each time it's been a splendid experience. For starters, the restaurant is beautiful, and the service is terrific.

Their fresh bread and pomegranate butter is such a nice way to start the meal. They have a great wine selection as well, and pair that with their Charcuterie plate of fine cheese and meats - you're in for a treat.

Some of my favorite items on their menu include the fried calamari (probably one of the best I've every had), shrimp and lemon gnocchi (rich & delicious), molisana salami pizza (yummm!), seafood Cobb salad (totally satisfying!), bucatini (fresh pasta, fresh tomato sauce - simplicity at it's best). 

Their Crème brûlée trio (caramel, vanilla and orange) is a must have, but so is their chocolate molten lava cake & cheesecake =) make sure you save room for dessert!

Eagerly awaiting my next visit to Napa on Providence!"}
{"text":"This was an okay place to experience and I don't really see myself going back here.  The place is nestled in a nice area, and although I thought the first area I saw for parking was small, I drove a little bit past the restaurant and was able to find great parking where I didn't feel like I had to cram my car into a spot.

I had gone into this restaurant with a party of five and honestly, when I stepped foot into the place, I didn't really feel warm and welcomed.  Perhaps it's because my party were all girls that look like we're still in high school/college.  While walking to our table, I noticed the decorations were all very beautiful in here.  We were able to have a booth long booth, and I really like having a booth for a party of 5 instead of just tables.  

The waiter was nice, but I felt that he wasn't quite attentive with us as he was to the other tables around us.  That really irked me.  He also did not mention to us the specials that they had for the night.  How were we able to order the specials?  I randomly noticed it written on the chalk board so I read the specials myself.

The food here definitely was not amazing for me.  The only thing that I really liked was the p.e.i. mussels.  If you come here, you definitely need to try that out.  My main meal was the braised short rib and grilled hanger steak.  I thought it tasted okay, but it was a little flavorless for me.  The spinach was something that definitely stuck out to me.  It was too salty!  I mean, I love salty food, but when it's too salty for me...no bueno!

All in all, not a good experience for me."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with some fabulous friends, and it was FANTASTIC! We sat on the patio and our server was very attentive and patient. They have bottomless mimosas (I think for $15 or $18); however, if you just want one it's only like $6. You just have to know to ask for a single glass. We made reservations which I would definitely suggest!

Some of the girls got chicken sandwiches (they asked for theirs grilled not fried). They were HUGE and they seemed to love them and the fries. As other reviewers noted, they have these really interesting copper glasses. Which, I actually expected to be a problem - I expected it to change the taste of the water, but it didn't. Inside the cup it looked like steel with only the hammered copper on the outside. For water, they bring you a bottle (just a plain glass bottle with a rubber stopper) of chilled water so you never run out. 

I skipped the mimosa on this occasion, but my friend ordered one and seemed to enjoy it. I looked around and noticed the mimosas were a big hit. In fact, I noticed some men had ordered mimosas but requested them in larger wine glasses than in the flutes - which I thought was clever. I also noticed one guy who asked for him mimosa in two wine glasses with OJ in one and champagne in the other - also clever!

Now I ordered the Pancetta Hash and Poached Eggs, which is something totally unusual for me to order. (See my photo.) THANK GOD I DID - OMG! Delish! So it reminded me of a farm-to-table rustic dish with a mix of cubed and roasted sweet potatoes with pancetta (which were like little cubes of cooked ham, more hammy than bacony - are those words?). There was thinly sliced and sauteed fennel mixed in (not to be confused with just the seeds, which can be quite potent. This was mild and really really good.). There were also sauteed sliced peppers mixed in and it was all well seasoned. On top of that, there were two perfectly poached eggs (hooray!) and on top of that there was a drizzle of their homemade hollandaise sauce. SO SO SO SO SO GOOD! 

Seriously, if you go for brunch, go outside the box and get this dish. You can get an omelet or waffles anywhere, this is a special dish. And it was reasonably priced at $12. If you're not driving, also go with the bottomless mimosas! I hope I get to go back soon! It was an hour drive from my home (I live North of the city), but was totally worth it - the food, the service, the atmosphere and the experience were all great!"}
{"text":"Walking in I felt the hostess was underdressed for the price/atmosphere of the place... black bra, light colored tshirt skinny jeans and boots. The bar staff wore maroon button down shirts/khakis and the servers green button downs/khakis... again felt a little casusal. The bar area was nice, I left the colors a little light, I think if they brought in more dark tones it would make it more cozy and wine-bar like.
We ordered 3 small plates: meatballs on polenta cakes, crab/lobster cakes and mozz cheese balls. The crab/lobster cakes were amazing... lots of crab/lobster and super fresh taste.. was served with some weird veggie salad thing. The fried mozz cheese was really tasty, the meatballs were eh... the polenta cakes were a little mushy and the meatballs were stuffed with mozz cheese and were ok, I wouldnt order again in lieu of trying something else. 
The service was very slow... when we got our food nobody came back to check on us... after we finished eating the server cleared our plates and never brought the check, we sat a good 10 minutes before he came back. It was also hot in there... the a/c wasnt on and I dont think the heat was either... had to go outside and cool off while waiting for the check.
I read some previous reviews and it appears they have taken what people said to heart - the bread is fresh baked, the mozz fresh made in house and the menu denotes where the food is comming from... the server was very knowledgeable and seemed excited about the food.
I would go back again for their happy hour (5-7) but dont think I would go back for dinner.... the prices are high (7$ a beer for a local beer, I had a local beer today for $2.50 at Midwood Smokehouse) and the food was decent but there was still no wow factor."}
{"text":"Service was very good! Food was excellent with a great atmosphere especially sitting outdoors. Good wine selection as well! Looking forward to going again!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday. Food was excellent. The restaurant is such a great looking place but the service was just top notch. From the hostess to the bar tender, these people cared about the customer. I will be heading back at Napa soon."}
{"text":"I was here for a work Christmas lunch and we were able to sample quite a few items off of the menu and I believe they deserve a solid 3 stars.  The food in theory all sounded amazing but I just don't feel like the execution was all it could have been.  Nothing was completely repulsive and nothing will encourage me to return.  It was just an \"OK\" experience all around.


We started with a few of their flatbread/pizzas.  The crust was thin and the flavor was bland.  There were a couple thin slices of onion and pebbles of chicken on the flavorless toasted bread.  There was no sauce and the cheese was plastic in texture and taste.

Next came the calamari.  It was an asian inspired calamari which doesn't seem to go well together but it was pretty decent.  I mean, let's be honest.  It was fried dough with a sweet and sour sauce dumped on it.  Of course it was good.  But in terms of real-deal, fresh calamari...it isn't even in the game.

Next up--mozzerella stuffed meatballs.  I was excited about this one but was let down.  The meat was tender and seasoned well but it didn't taste like ground beef.  In fact I would almost suggest it was a turkey or chicken meatball.  There was very little sauce so that was disappointing and the cheese in the center was so minimal that it probably shouldn't even be mentioned.  They were just okay.

For my main meal I ordered the special.  It was scallops on top of red pepper risotto.  The scallops seemed to be fresh, nice and tender and didn't require much seasoning.  The risotto wasn't really risotto...it was orzo pasta but the red pepper flavoring was done well and besides the fact I was expecting traditional risotto, it was pretty good.

A couple co-workers ordered chicken sandwiches and one ordered the filet mignon burger.  I've never heard of that but it certainly has potential to be good.  She seemed to be enjoying it.  

For dessert we tried quite a few items.  They had a creme brulee trio (chocoate, vanilla and peppermint), eggnog cheesecake, double chocolate cake, and red velvet cupcakes.  The vanilla and chocolate creme brulee were fine--good, not great.  I didn't even try the peppermint custard because that just sounded gross.  The eggnog cheesecake was festive and truly tasted like eggnog which I thought was pretty good.  The double chocolate cake was more like a mousse and it was served cold, which I hate.  I prefer warm and serve it with ice cream please!  


We were given the back room for the \"party\" and that fit the 10 of us quite nicely.  I also think the patio with the lounge furniture and heat lamps is lovely.  It would certainly be nice to hang out there during the warmer months when they offer live music.

All in all I think this place has some good to offer but nothing great that I could see.  I feel like they try to offer 5 star dishes at a 5 star price but with a 3 star budget.  Nothing was done exceptionally well and nothing was necessarly memorable.  It was all Ok."}
{"text":"A nice dinner spot for couples or small groups of friends. I have been here a few times (~5) and have enjoyed it each time. Most recently we grabbed dinner on a Thursday night from the front patio and there was live music and great service (as usual)"}
{"text":"Nice lunch, a bit pricey.

The decor is modern and very attractive; the place attracts a mixed-age crowd for lunch and is probably so popular for dinner and socializing that its large parking lot is full most evenings. The pricing is from moderate to expensive.

Our meal began with bread accompanied by a delicious pomegranate butter. My wife's salmon caesar salad and my spaghetti entrees were tasty and attractively presented. Lunch for two plus two glasses of wine was $50; the single small meatball I added to my order of spaghetti cost an extra $3.00.

Service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. However, the waiter failed to inform us that our wines were from kegs, not bottles, a trend that is spreading across the country because it saves money for vintners and restaurants--not for diners. The sauvignon blanc my wife had was so good we would like to buy more of it but a 20 liter keg is a bit much for just the two of us. My less expensive cabernet sauvignon was OK but a bit too tannic before it had a chance to breathe for awhile. A few wines are served old-style from open bottles, while still others are served from an automated preservation and pouring system that is supposed to keep a bottle fresh for up to 60 days (perhaps my rough-edged cab came from a bottle that was on its 59th day).

There were only two negative elements, neither of which would keep us from coming back again. Indoors virtually every surface (walls, floors, windows, ceiling) is hard and reflects the overly-loud sound of the piped-in music and the chatter and clatter of the diners and staff. There is outdoor seating that is a bit quieter, though with some road noise, a choice that is of course dependent on good weather. The other criticism has to do with serving drinking water in metal goblets, which for some people can convey a slightly bitter or metallic taste that interferes with enjoying the meal and wine. Happily, even though most of the wines come from kegs or preserver/dispensers, they are served in real glasses so there is no added metal taste as with the water goblets. 

Bottom line:  We look forward to coming back some day."}
{"text":"2 years later and Sunday Brunch was still solid. On the other hand, I'm amazed that they haven't updated the brunch menu - I guess if it ain't broken, don't fix it.

I didn't have bottomless mimosa this time, but most of my friends did. Our waiter was GREAT with bringing refills. Food was great, I didn't feel like brunch food and went with the duck confit gnocchi ($11) which was a good size portion for a small plate AND DE-LI-CIOUS!

Solid brunch spot - good job with keeping up a good job!"}
{"text":"The bar is waaaaay too loud. There should be some sound absorbing panels or curtains on the ceiling."}
{"text":"This place hands down is one of the best places for brunch in Charlotte.  They have unlimited mimosas and sangria!  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.  The food super delish.  My husband loves their chicken and waffles a must try for everyone!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. All I can say. The food is exquisite. The beer selection is choice. Best place in North Carolina."}
{"text":"This is my go to brunch restaurant! Whenever someone asks me where they should go, if they have never been here than this is always my first choice for them. I've probably tried everything on the menu and have yet to be disappointed. My favs are the short rib Benedict and the duck confit Benedict! Both will leave you wanting more and those potatoes on the side are perfectly seasoned and roasted sooo good. There lunch and dinner menus are really good too but who doesn't enjoy a good brunch on the weekend.
They use to have bottomless mimosas which would have to sitting there for hours literally but now they do $16 for a carafe and it's still so worth it because you will feel it after the first one and you can get at minimum 4/5 out of the carafe. 
I've been here too many times to remember but I do remember each server I've had because they all have been wonderful. Whoever does the hiring keep it up because I have yet to have a server with the slightest of an attitude or anything, they are always smiling and eager to take your order and make sure everything is going good.
They have lots of seating and on a nice day I always opt for the patio! They also have some nice rooms to hold events as well."}
{"text":"5 years ago, we would have given this place 5 stars.  Now, it's a shame that we can only give it 2.
First of all, we will never dine in the main dining area again because it smells like dirty wash rags!!  It has been this way for several years now. We mentioned this twice to our servers over the past year, but it still smells bad.  We were so embarrassed that we went against our better judgement and ignored the smell and brought some friends from out of town.  Our one friend, who speaks his mind, pointed out the smell after only 5 minutes!!!  We were so embarrassed!
We moved to the bar area, and no problem there.
From that day on, we never dined in the dining area again!!  We really liked this place and continued to go, but only sat in the bar.  No issues, until the last several months.  The food has gone downhill.  Every dish tasted like they seasoned it with salt!  No taste, just salty. Awful.  And, when we ordered wine at the bar, they were basically out of everything we requested.  Gave us a sip of what was left in a bottle, then walked away and never offered to let us taste anything else or even ask if we wanted anything else!!  The other night, we were the only ones at the bar, there were 2 bartenders and we sat for 10 minutes without a glance our way!!!  It was weird and unacceptable!!  
We sooo use to enjoy the food and service here, but wow, it sure has declined.  We were going to host a Valentine's dinner in the room with the fireplace, but after our experience last week, we decided it was not going to happen.  So disappointed with this place as of late.  Don't think we will be back.  Food, wine selection and service has declined rapidly.  Too bad."}
{"text":"SO GOOD!!

Talk about a hidden heaven, this place is to die for! The wine list is HUGE and you can have tastings, half glasses, one glass or by the bottle. The food is fantastic - I had the grilled hanger steak salad - YUMM!! Our server, Katrina, was wonderful at helping us pick out and recommending different cheeses and meats when ordering the Charcuterie (which also had the most amazing granola/honey on it). I could tell from her upbeat personality that she was a passionate foodie just like me! She took excellent care of us and told us all about the brunch they offer on the weekends too!

Attending on a Wednesday night also allowed us the pleasant sounds of a live band, Stella's fellas, while we enjoyed our dinner. 

Best Tip about this place: The location is on a dead end street, meaning it's a tucked away and there is outdoor seating with very little traffic - its peaceful and quite. 

I DO NOT RECOMMEND BRINGING CHILDREN HERE."}
{"text":"I came here with a good friend of mine for restaurant week and I am so happy we got a last minute reservation on a Friday night. It was AMAZING!! We loved every minute of it. The decor and the ambiance of the restaurant was great. It would be perfect for a date night. We sat in front of the kitchen and it wasn't loud or distracting at all. Our server, Emily was great. She gave us suggestions on the wine and wasn't too overwhelming checking in on us. 

We each got different meals which was good because we got to try each other's and let me tell you, nothing was a disappointment. The meal came with a glass of wine (PLUS!) I ordered the mussels-they were decent..a good amount for one person, she got the roasted beet salad. For our entrees I ordered the grilled hanger steak and it was cooked perfectly. It came on top of a bed of saffron risotto. It was good, but a bit too salty for me, which was fine because I could give the leftovers to my salt-loving boyfriend. My friend got the smoked chicken florentine which came with spinach gnocchi and sundried tomatoes. It was delicious. For dessert I got the chocolate lasagna (pretty much a chocolate torte) and she got the blackberry shortcake. It was superb. 

I will definitely be back to visit this place, the servers were sweet, there wasn't a wait, and the food was great."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, and it was great. Good soups, mussels, and beer/wine selection."}
{"text":"Our reservation was set for 9:45 as we arrived we were greeted in a timely manner. The overall layout and decor was beautiful and very welcoming. To my surprise, it was family friendly.

Usually, the most important aspect of any restaurant is the service. Our service was excellent and she was very engaging with everyone in the table. We were very grateful for the amount of interaction an especially how friendly she was to our 1 year old. 

The food was... Simply amazing. I am not sure if we can find anything negative. We started off with the corn breads which were soft and very sweet. 

Our small plates consisted of a Napa Salad for my wife which was beautifully prepare, fresh and very vibrant. I order a cup of mushroom soup which was very savory. Our entrees were delicious and very filling. My wife order the sausage frittata and I order the short rib benedict. The food had very well balance of flavor and freshness. 

Regardless of the hectic day the staff had ahead of them, they were all very cheerful and friendly. I can't stress enough to the importance of the great service.  To top it off we received a gift card which we plant to use at Napa."}
{"text":"Good spot, great wine, and great food! I just tried their new seasonal menu and it was amazing."}
{"text":"To be perfectly honest, I had written this place off a while ago after they first opened, due to so-so yelp reviews. Went for drinks and apps tonight, and everything was delicious. Great cocktail options (including infused vodka/tequila), great wine selections (on tap!) - tried the pork belly, summer vegetable pizza, and the bruschetta - they were all sooooo good! AND they have a drink/food happy hour from 5-7. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went for apps and wine, shrimp pizza was outstanding. Also enjoyed meatballs, fries, and beef carpaccio. Sat outside around 530 on Saturday no rush and great weather. Like the larger cab glasses for the wine. Staff was friendly and checked with us consistently."}
