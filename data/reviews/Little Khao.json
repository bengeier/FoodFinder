{"text":"This was one of our choices when we came to Assembly Hall to try out some Toronto cuisine.  I saw someone walk by with the Pad Ka Prao and I definitely had to try it, it did not disappoint at all.  After adding some chilis(provided on the counter), the flavor was perfect.  The pork was soft and the veggies gave a nice contrast in texture.  The poached egg on top was also a beautiful complement.  It was a little bit pricy at $22 but the portions are pretty big so it was worth it.  Pad ka prao: 8.5/10"}
{"text":"The Pad Gra Prao was really good. The service not so much.  Staff was not helpful and borderline rude."}
{"text":"If you're a Thai food lover, you know that Little Khao is an offshoot of the popular Khao San Road.  Although they have a limited menu, the taste/price didn't deviate from the mother company.  I was happy to see that they have my fave - Khao Soi but didn't order this as I was craving for the Pad Gra Prao Pork ($13 + tax/tip) - stir fried pork with holy basil and long beans on rice.   If you want fried egg that's an additional $2, although it's more of a soft poached egg judging by how it disintegrates into the rice. And if you want to spice up your dish they have an assortment of fresh/dried chilis that you can customize based on your taste.  Although I only got the small size, the portions were huge and in the end I didn't get to finish it since I was already full.   Next to the cashier, you will also find a wall full of popcorn bags which is made of butter, caramel, corn, and chilli. Looks interesting so I might have to try this next time."}
{"text":"As a big fan of the Khao San Road restaurants I was so happy to see that they opened in the Chef's hall right by the office! I had the green curry and it was delicious. Just as tasty as the Restaurant. The hall itself is pretty cool, kind of busy at lunch time though so be prepared to fight for a place to eat. Little Khao had my curry ready within minutes so the process is still pretty swift. Great job, 5 stars"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this. So many great restaurants in one spot. Alas, I was extremely let down. I went about 2:30 in the afternoon on a weekday, probably not a great time to go but it is what it is.   After walking around to decide on an option I went with Little Khao as I had been craving Khao San Road. After ordering I was told it would take ten minutes to prepare. I came back after 10 minutes and got my food.   It looked great but that's about all that was great about it. The food was ice ice cold. I get if it was sitting and waiting for me (which the chef told me was the case). There's absolutely no way that even the bottom of the bowl of food/Khao Soi sauce could have gotten cold that quickly plus the chunks of beef were as cold as if they had just been taken out of the fridge.   I took it back and they offered to make me a fresh one but at that point I was hungry and over it. I asked for a refund and they had to go find a manager to process it. That entire part had me waiting around like a tool for an additional 10 minutes until they tracked down a manager and processed the transaction.  I walked around trying to find another lunch option but everything was overpriced and or had things I can't eat like lobster.   I'm clearly not the target audience of upwardly mobile office workers with more money than idea of what quality food is like. This place sadly missed the mark and I say go to the restaurants instead of their permanent pop ups. If you're paying those prices you may as well get fresh, hot food served to you."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food - it tasted as good as in Khao San Road. The broth was rich and flavourful. The beef was tender. The portion was pretty generous and $17 is on the higher price tag, but at least I enjoyed the food.   2 stars for the service - only 2 people were working (cashier and kitchen) during lunch time made the wait extra long. I waited for 25 minutes for my food which is not acceptable for lunch service. Please put more staff or train them to be more efficient because they didn't act very fast anyway."}
{"text":"I might be a little bias or maybe I am just bias.  I love Thai food. I can eat Thai food everyday. Sadly up in Markham, my hood, it is hard to find good authentic Thai food. Every time when I come downtown, I ended up going to Pai, KSR, Sabai Sabai.....  Little Khao has a limited selection but that's all you need. In Thailand, you might even have a stall that selling just one item of their specialty. If it is good, people will come.  Pad Gra Prao ($17) so much flavours from the holy basil. The large portion is good to share as there was quite a lot of minced pork. The poached egg maybe a little under cooked.  Can't wait to have some more down to earth Thai food next time when I visit Assembly Chef's Hall."}
