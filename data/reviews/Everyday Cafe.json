{"text":"Everyday Cafe is a really solid coffee shop that accommodates all of the major necessities - Lots of seating for a variety of preferences, it is bright and comfortable, the menu is comprehensive, with some fun novelties such as the waffle shot (espresso in a chocolate waffle cone), and the espresso/coffee is on point. The folks working here are very friendly and helpful. Donna, the chief operator, came and talked to us for a few moments to check our experience and get a rating on the drinks. I didn't have any food, but they do have lunch options."}
{"text":"As soon as I enter this Caf√© I knew immediately this was going to be my new favorite spot! Very clean place,staff very courteous and obliging.I had the corned beef sandwich for lunch which was good,i would've said great but they didn't have spicy brown mustard that is must for my sandwiches,lol. Green tea was great.  I was also pleasantly surprised that Wifi was at a adequate strength and FAST! Cozy and calm ambience. Fantastic place to get some work done or read. One last note this place is cashless, debit/credit cards only."}
{"text":"First time here, this will definitely be my new coffee spot. They do not take cash, so be sure to bring credit/debit. Coffee is delicious, flavorful and affordable. Not crowded on a Sunday morning, like the vibe of the shop."}
{"text":"A gem in the beautiful Homewood neighborhood, just steps from the busway and a block from the business district.   Everyday cafe has great views and plenty of natural light to contrast with the dark decor. It feels a bit like a bookshop.  The menu is always changing and they tend to feature locally grown produce when possible. I like the waffleshot (espresso in a waffle cone), but I also enjoy a more traditional espresso drink like a latte here.  It's a great place to study or catch up with a friend. See you there."}
{"text":"I love their cashless system and they are the go-to-spot if you are in the area. If you are trying to get some wi-fi and meet awesome people. This is the place to start. Also, they are continually refining their menu, so they really take your suggestions. They are extremely friendly and they are all about customer service."}
{"text":"Hey now I normally don't review things and rarely would I ever give five stars..... but this place is phenomenal!! The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, the coffee and pastries are deeeeeelicious! Old and young alike are the atmosphere. If you're like me and wanna chat a bit everyone if friendly. The CHAI TEA LATTE IS THE BEST!!!! Yes I've been to Zeke's , Taza D'oro, Starbucks and. Coffee Tree. This chai is second to none. Check em out. Lifelong Pittsburgh resident. Hands down the best."}

{"text":"This place is great.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The food is wonderful.  It is very relaxing.  I will definitely be back.  Can't wait to try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Quiet, lots of space, good for doing work (free wifi + plenty of outlets). Staff really friendly and helpful, one of them hooked me up with a free drink. Lots of street parking available when I went on a Sunday. Some food available too. I like that they support local artists & give back to the community. Beans are fare trade. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for a good coffee and pastry to get some work done or catchup with a friend.  Sandwiches are good too!"}
