{"text":"By far the best Mexican food in town.  

Since moving from Texas, near the border, I have been deprived of good Mexican food....until Mas Amigas.

I agree, the Mole sauce is not very good, but everything else I have tried has completely surpassed everything I have tasted in champaign.

I recommend the Mexicana sauce on cheese enchiladas and the chorizo tortas.  The chips and salso are very fresh and are the best in town.  

I also need to mention how amazing the service is.  They are extremely friendly and the food comes out very quickly."}
{"text":"Wow. I went to Mas Amigos for the first time yesterday and I could not have been more impressed. 
The service was quick. Our waiter was polite. Our food was excellent!
The chips and salsa are great. Actually, the salsa isn't overly amazing itself, but it is tasty. The chips are where it's at! They're warm, flaky, and probably the best that I've had in town. You can tell they're fresh and not poured out of a bag.
What I was impressed with was the quality of my lunch. I got the burrito. It's more authentic than anything I've ever received at Dos or El Torro (which I enjoy). It wasn't greasy at all. 
This will be my new go-to restaurant when I want Mexican!"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are always warm and fresh, so addictive. I've had the enchiladas verdes, tacos, and torta cubana, all of which have been solid. The torta cubana is like the mexican take on a fat sandwich... everything (steak, ham, beans, hot dog?!, jalapenos, lettuce/tomato... probably more that I've forgotten) is in it, and the result is frighteningly delicious. Highly recommended, definitely try it if you are looking for something different."}
{"text":"Margarita Pitchers and to-die-for chips and salsa.

Hidden gem on Springfield that puts La Bamba and Dos Reales to shame.

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Mas Amigos is my favorite Mexican Restaurant in Champaign.  I think this is the most authentic Mexican food you will find in Champaign.  The guacamole & chips are very fresh & the best I've ever had.... & the steak tacos are DELISHHH!"}
{"text":"We love Mas Amigos.  Having been gone most of the summer, we drove by and found it is no longer open.  What a bummer!  Did it move?  Why is it closed?"}
{"text":"There is not a bad thing I can say about Mas!  From the moment you walk in you are welcomed and immediately attended to!  All of the wait staff know us, we are in there pretty often, and they are super nice and are great with kids!  They make an awesome margarita on the rocks and my husband loves to get a Victoria.  Go-to things include the tamales! (both veggie and meat)  The vegetarian ones are filled with peppers and cheese, super delicious for meat eaters and not alike!  The meat ones are filled with chicken.  The masa is tender and moist and perfect.  We also enjoy the tortas.  they all come with beans, cheese, lettuce, tom, onion, avocado, jalapenos and mayo.  My husband enjoys the combinada which is a mixture of chorizo and steak (a Mexican sloppy Joe!) While I usually go for the Cubana which consists of milanesa, a hot dog and ham. (It's so friggen good!)  My husband also enjoys the vegetarian #2 torta which is stuffed with poblano peppers, it looks equally amazing as the rest.  On every occasion we have to get at least one taco. (They gotta be corn tortilla w/ cilantro and onions!) and they give you a little lime wedge to squeeze over it, can't go wrong.  I enjoy the chorizo and steak ones while my husband goes for pastor or lengua.  The lengua really does give it a much meatier, beefy taste.  At lunch I like to get the steak quesadilla with sides of grilled veggies and black beans.  It's nice to have choices other than your regular rice'n'beans.  And how can I forget, they have amazing tortilla chips and super delicious fresh salsa!  The chips are warm and crispy and seasoned lightly.  Nothing beats a fresh tortilla chip!  If someone let me I would probably eat 10 baskets full!  They also have delicious sauces if you ask for them!  There is a green one and a red one.  The green one is a light creamy avocado tomatillo cilantro oniony, spicy sauce (as far as my palate can tell me) and I def prefer it, as my husband prefers the red.  Its a dark smokey spicy sauce.  (sorry I can't be more descriptive of it as I've already consumed half the green sauce bottle by now!)   =]  I put it on the chips, in my quesadilla on my tortas, tacos... anything!  I've tried almost everything, I like the close your eyes run your finger down the menu and stop method.  You will love your pick every time!"}
{"text":"This looked exactly like the place which I typically enjoy - a locally owned, authentic Mexican restaurant. Chips and salsa were very promising but everything went quickly downhill from there. The chicken (Pollo Mas Amigos) - apparently their signature dish was poorly presented (a heaping mass of veggies) and poorly cooked with no flavor - either in the veggies or in the chicken.

The desserts were nothing to speak of either. Skip it."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. Chips and salsa are awesome.  After eating hear I prefer mas amigos to the others. Staff were friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Service was great and the food was delicious. Manuel was extremely helpful with describing what each dish was. This place is perhaps even better than Cocina Real! I don't know what Deborah ordered but it must have been off the sides menu because everything we got at my table came with all the sides! Cannot wait to go again! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow is the service bad!! I made an online order for delivery and what a mistake. I waited 30 minutes after the 60 minute approximate delivery time to call them to ask where my food was. The guy who answered the phone (after letting the phone ring for  2 minutes) proceeded to argue with me that he had called and spoke to me twice and no one answered the door to pick up the food. I had been waiting by my phone since I had made the order and had not once received a call. They didn't even offer to fix their mistake and bring me my order. So incredibly disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh man. This place is awesome. They've got great service, and I don't know how they make those chips, but it's a good thing those things aren't for sale somewhere because I'd get so fat if I could eat them at home. The salsa you get isn't the most amazing thing I've had, but the chips definitely make up for it. I really like their guacamole too. Tastes really fresh and really delicious.

They're food's great too. I've tried their tortas and their tacos, and I loved them. I also got the fajita taco salad once, but that wasn't as good in my opinion. They've got some egg dishes too that I'm wanting to try. The best part about Mas Amigos though is that it's cheap even though it's delicious and filling. I've never paid more than $10 a person, and I usually only pay around $5 and I'm satisfied. I'm really happy this place is here."}
{"text":"Went to their new location, and everything is just as good as before.  I'm bummed that I can no longer walk there, but hopefully this move will let them reach more people with their delightful Mexicanity and the best tortilla chips in town."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The only downside is that the secret's out and sometimes it's crowded.  

The food is amazing and it's cheap.  The chips are fresh made - light and flaky and usually hot.  They can be enjoyed  with the amazing green and red sauces.  Others have mentioned the sauces, but the green is just fantastic.  It's some blend of avocado, lime, cilantro, tomatillo, and just a little pepper, I think - and it is delicious on everything.

I've had the beef and beef tongue tacos.  The pork tacos are great too - they are pretty simple, with some fresh cilantro and onion over the tender meat.  The lunch combos are good too and the seasonings are flavorful and delicious.

I think the amount of food is just right if you're feeling hungry - not as much as some of the other Mexican places in town, but it's cheap and I think the quality is better.  

The service also deserves special mention - they manage to be both fast and very friendly.  They're fast enough to make this a good lunch break stop even if you have limited time.  

This has become our go-to Mexican place and I can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"(Not to be confused with the Mexican grocery of the same name in Urbana, or 'Los Amigos' on Green Street.)

The service was good. Its a small operation, and they keep on top of everything.

The chips were excellent, they were the homestyle type, and I would guess they were freshly fried.

The Chicken Mole special was... not good. The chicken was somewhat tough and dry, and the mole didn't have a nice balanced flavor like moles I've had elsewhere: the cocoa powder taste was overwhelming. I should have sent it back."}
{"text":"When they say amigos, they arent kidding. friendly service. great veggie tacos and tasty veg burrito. When I asked if the beans were vegetarian they didnt look at me like i was from another planet (which i am incidently... Los Angeles, where Mexican food is never served with ground beef). And the answer was YES. correct!  

I have yet to try the margaritas, but the salsa was fresh, and the chips excellent. I cant speak for the meat dishes, but for veggie mexican food in the shampoo banana, it cant be beat.  I would say the food is on par with El Charro, but a little less greasy and with nicer atmosphere.  do it!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in town for Mexican! Until it opened, Dos Reales was the best... but you can't beat in-house made chips and salsa.

Their vegetarian fajitas are superly delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's a nice, cheap Mexican joint with good, greasy food, and probably my favorite Mexican place in Champaign.

I've only been to the new location once, but my experience was positive. The food was good; I had the chicken quesadila and my girlfriend had the steak fajitas. There were only three tortillas with the fajitas, but that's only a bit of a quibble. Portions are nice and big, and I liked the chips and salsa. The margaritas weren't the best I've ever had, but they're okay for the price, and they're pretty strong."}
{"text":"We were visiting Champaign and my guy wanted Mexican food. We were headed to Chevy's because had it once before and said it was ok. I used Yelp to find out the rating. I saw that Mas Amigas had a higher rating and I was feeling adventurous so I said we should go check it out. When we pulled in my first thought was run-down greasy spoon. Then I saw a gentleman on a nice, clean red shirt and apron so I said let's go in, the staff looks good. The inside was small and the restrooms even smaller. The visual did nothing to prepare us for anything. Soon after we were seated the place filled up, people were waiting in line to be seated. Once we got our food, I realized why- the food was amazing!! I lived in Texas for several years and this was better than anything I had there!! I had the Pollo Pablano, my guy had the steak and shrimp fajitas and my daughter had a combo plate. For dessert we shared the fried ice cream,  not really fried ice cream but hood none the less. It was the server's first day so the rest of the staff kept helping her make sure we had refills, napkins, etc. Our experience was awesome! We will go there next time we visit!!"}
{"text":"This is, by far, the best Mexican in town. And that said, it is also one of the cheapest places to eat. I know it is near campus, but it is sooooooo good and I recommend it to all. I eat there at least once a week and I have yet to be anything but happy!"}
{"text":"I remember eating here very often when it was located at the previous location. I graduated and moved on and now I come back to review and they have moved so I am wondering if my opinion is even valid. However, for whatever it's worth, I do want to share that their beefsteak tacos with cilantro and onion with a hint of lime is absolutely as authentic as it gets from Mexico. I always ordered the tacos with rice and beans. If not ordering take-out and dining-in, I do agree with everyone's love for the never ending chips and salsa. I almost got full for over eating the chips one time. Despite the apparent decline in service from other reviews, I am purely making my high marks for their authentic Mexican tacos and bottomless chips and salsa. I am a creature of habit...when I find something I love and taste, I stick to it and don't order other things on the menu. I only went their to eat my beefsteak tacos. Uno mas!"}
{"text":"Homemade chips, awesome margaritas, the best enchiladas I've ever had. Mas Amigos is my favorite Mexican in the CU!"}
{"text":"The only authentic Mexican food in Chambana, as far as I know. Pretty cheap, too. If you want your enchiladas WITHOUT the globs of orange cheese and WITH flavor, this is your spot. Really, their only competition is Taco Motorizado, but they run that too."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic/amazing Mexican food that you will find in Champaign.  The enchiladas were great (especially the mole) and tasted just like they do in SoCal.  The tortilla chips were a little heavy on grease, but as a plus they are fresh, deep fried tortillas.  Mas Amigos does not simply wrap chicken in a tortilla and slather cheese sauce on top of the dish (as almost every other Mexican food restaurant in town does minus Taco Loco).  The service was fast/friendly and I will definitely be eating there again!"}
{"text":"Consistently one of my favorite places, especially after their recent all around make-over.  New menu items including lots of new vegetarian options.  The servers are great and fast.  Best Chips."}
{"text":"no thanks.... and here's why...

i ordered from mas amigos online for pick up.  the address was listed on springfield... my husband went to pick it up.   20 minutes later, he returns to tell me the building is empty.  he has no idea where to go.  i called the number and asked if they had moved, and the woman on the phone said, \"yes.  to university ave.\"  i tell her my husband is coming to pick up an order.  he will be there in 20 minutes.  she says, \"no problem.\"

he gets back in the car... and away he goes.  across town.  again.

he has been gone for about 20 minutes when the phone rings.  a man tells me he is delivering my food from mas amigos, and he can't seem to find my address.  i tell him i've ordered online for pick up, not delivery.  he tells me that \"pick up\" is no longer an option.  no longer an option?!  as of when?!  20 minutes ago?  

i direct the man to my door who hands me the food, i've already paid for online.  i tell him my husband is sitting in his restaurant right now, waiting to pick this food up.  he shrugs his shoulders at me, and sort of walks off, telling me to apologize to my husband for him.  (yep.  that ought to do it.  i'm sure he will be supremely less pissed now.)

my husband comes in the door 20 minutes later with no food.  he tells me that he was charged for our food again at the restaurant because the woman at the counter (who ironically was reading \"things fall apart\") didn't know that there was any order for pick up.  she re-rung the entire order and charged him for it.  she then received a call from the delivery guy explaining what had happened.  she said she couldn't void the transaction, and that the manager would do it when he came in the next day.  

guess what?  he didn't, and it took me two days of calling him to get it done.  guess what?  my food was cold when i got it and it was so not worth paying for it once.  guess what?  i'll never eat at mas amigos again.  their customer service was crap.  

their website information was wrong -- the address, the pick up vs. delivery information, even their phone number was incorrect.

the employees seemed to not even know what was going on or what the policies were.  the manager was unapologetic and they didn't handle this situation very well at all.  

if their food is good, i have no idea, and i probably won't know because i won't order from them again."}
{"text":"My husband drives by this place on his weekly route so we thought we'd try it for lunch. I was surprised that at 2 pm on a Sunday afternoon about 1/2 of the tables were still full. There isn't a lot of seating in this little place but the service was fantastic. The chips, salsa and hot sauces were a great  start to the meal! Flaky chips with great crunch, yum!

 My hubs got chicken fajitas. Great seasoning on the fixings. His sides were rice and grilled veggies. The grilled veg were nicely cooked without being mushy. 

I got pollo los amigos ( I think). It was chicken with onions, green pepper, and mushrooms, covered in cheese. My sides were refried beans and rice. I enjoyed that the beans were not completely pulverized and still had actual pieces of beans in them. Flavor on the beans was just okay though. The main dish was cooked perfectly and presented pleasantly. I was a bit unsure about the corn tortillas, as I don't usually enjoy dark colored ones, but the chicken and that lovely green sauce completely made up for them. We will certainly be going back again!"}
{"text":"The chip and salsa were really good. But the rest of the meal was not. I had a chicken burrito with rice and beans. The chicken was really dry and they gave me maybe two diced tomatoes and a couple of shreds of lettuce to go with it. I love beans but their beans I did not. Not much flavor. Maybe something else might be better. The person that went with me got the fajita salad and thought it was good."}
{"text":"Just ate dinner at Mas Amigos for the first time, and I am definitely impressed. The food is super cheap, but the service and quality is the best I've had when it comes to the many Mexican restaurants in the C-U area. We had a brand new server, but he did such a great job that I never would have guessed if he hadn't told us. I'll definitely be going to Mas Amigos again soon. Maybe for lunch?..."}
{"text":"I ate here last week and it was a pretty good meal. It is a really small place. It was not the best Mexican meal I have ever had but not the worst.

The chips were very good, but I did not like the salsa. It was very runny and too spicy for me. However, I know that some people really like their salsa like this.

There are a lot of vegetarian items on the menu which I thought was great. You don't often see that in a restaurant. I ordered the fajitas and asked if they would substitute mushrooms and squash for the bell peppers and tomatoes and they did so without a charge. The fajita meat came in really small pieces which makes it easier to put on the tortillas and eat without it falling out everywhere. My only other complaint is that the meat and vegetables weren't seasoned enough. They needed a little bit more and they would have been great."}
{"text":"We were extremely dissatisfied by our visit. We  used to frequent Cocina Real, in the same location, and since the staff and management are the same we assumed the quality would be as well. Right off the bat we realized how sub-par the food actually was- the tortilla chips were completely disgusting. They were so oily (the wax paper lining the chip basket was completely soaked) and a horribly flaky texture. We wondered if the chef has fried the tortillas at the wrong temperature or for too long. When we received our food, we were horrified at the greasiness of our food. It went beyond the typical unhealthiness of mexican food- the food was literally inedible from the amount of oil it was covered in. The size of our orders was so small for the price we paid for them. We were terrified to order dessert for fear that our flan would come drenched in oil as well. When we received the check, the prices we were charged did not match those on the menu (we were charged additional). We will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of my three local places I eat on a regular basis. There is nothing bad about this place. The drinks, the service, the food is all far superior to any other Mexican food in town.

Try the Tacos, especially the chorizo or lengua. The Tortas are amazing and filling. Their Tamales are great. Eat the chips as they are fresh made and ask for the fresh sauces they put out."}
{"text":"Mas Amigos is, consistently, the best place to get Mexican food in C-U.  Their staff are incredibly friendly, and the place always feels warm and welcoming whenever I enter.  I invariably get something with chorizo because 1) They do it well here and 2) I EFFING LOVE CHORIZO AND YOU CANNOT TELL ME ANY DIFFERENT SO THERE.

When life is hard or you want a moment to celebrate an accomplishment in grad school (end of a conference, successful presentation, glad you survived another week) then it is time to pitch in for a pitcher or three of margaritas.  They are decently sized, about the right strength, and although a little too sweet, still manage to make a fun evening even more fun.  

And if this hasn't convinced you of the joys of Mas Amigos, know that it also boasts a view of the wonderfully dubious C-U landmark, Illini-Arcade.  Yes, that's right, you can see the wooden fence that obscures the parking lot of the sex emporium known as Illini Arcade whilst you enjoy delicious Mexican food and/or watch awesome Spanish language TV.

I'm just saying, it makes for a wonderful night.  Also, CHORIZO."}
{"text":"Best enchiladas I've had outside of Chihuahua, Mexico (chicken and tomatillos) and awesome pork and pineapple enchiladas."}
{"text":"By far the worst Mexican food I've ever had. It only gets the 2nd star because the service was decent probably due to being one of three people in here. The salsa had no flavor and looked like vomit. Tried to doctor it with their hot sauce to no avail. Chicken enchilada tasted like bumblebee tuna drenched in ranchero sauce that tasted like tomato soup with a touch of hot sauce. Steak burrito had no flavor and was the size of a taco. Rice and beans are the same the burrito...no flavor! As I received the bill an ant crawled across the table!  Awful place! Awful experience!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for cheap, delicious, and authentically fresh Mexican food in the CU area. From tacos to chimichangas, everything I've had at this place has met my expectations. 

And the chips and salsa: wow. Seriously, for $4 you can get two tacos along with the bottomless chips and salsa and leave very satisfied.

The place isn't huge, but I think that works to the restaurant's advantage as servers are always nearby and ready to refill drinks or chips. However I haven't been during peak dinner hours, so I don't know if the size is really an issue.

Highly recommended. El Toro, Burrito King, etc. have nothing on Mas Amigos."}
{"text":"Que horrible! This was my favorite local Mexican restaurant...until tonight.  My husband and I go there enough to know that they are capable of better. Unfortunately today they did not care about providing even the most fundamental elements of customer service. Our server clearly did not want to be there which was evident by his blatant lack of attentiveness.  After he finally brought us menus, we quickly decided on what to order. Unfortunately, in the amount of time it took our server to return to the table, we could have read the menus front-to-back, two times over. We figured hey maybe the kitchen is very busy at this hour. Then I realized that our server was sitting in a booth rolling silverware. Not just him, three others as well! I've been a server before. I get it. You have to roll silverware, but to do that in lieu of tending to (well-tipping) patrons is a sign of carelessness. What was most annoying was that I made eye contact with them and was ignored. Eventually, I was able to wave down our server and we ordered. I guess he grew tired of us and recruited a coworker to take over. The new server was better. Although he did take my drink and disappear without refilling it for a while. At least he cracked a smile and showed some sign of life. The worst part of this experience was watching everyone else get service...except us. I'm not likely to return to a restaurant when I'm left feeling unwelcome."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time when the place was on Springfield and Champaign but the new place in Urbana does not taste the same It has no flavor no seasoning and very slow service And the salsa taste like spaghetti sauce and they don't have their homemade red hot sauce"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and each time has been pretty enjoyable.  Had the tortas in various forms as well as a couple other dishes.  The green sauce at the table is delicious.

I might have a taco \"face-off\" between here and el charro... we'll see who wins."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Tried it once and we keep going back.  We now consider it our favorite Mexican Restaurant in Champaign.  Chips and salsa always fresh and delicious, wonderful margharitas, and the most delicious fresh food.  The service has always been friendly and fun, too.  Did I mention the chips and salsa are incredible???"}
{"text":"As others have said, the chips are really, really tasty.  The tacos were quite tasty, the rice was good as well.  Others have said they liked the enchiladas, but I didn't much care for the sauce on top of them, which kind of reminded me of canned chili.  Service was quite fast and accurate.  It was also a nice bonus to have a bottle of guacamole right there on the table.  Lunch prices were better than reasonable.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Just okay. The chips were awesome but nothing else was. Margaritas were kind if weak and the food was only okay."}
{"text":"I don't live in Champaign anymore, but I did spend a few years there, and those years may have colored my feelings about Mas Amigos in comparison to its competition.

On its own merit, Mas Amigos is a no nonsense kind of place which provides very fresh chips and salsa and the food is decent. 

However, given the choice to go to any Mexican restaurant in the Champaign-Urbana area, and having tried Mas Amigos out, I think that I would still head over to El Toro or Dos Reales.  Old habits die hard."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. It took our table 2 hours to order, get our food and pay. My two tacos were oily and nothing to rave about. They even messed up my order, leaving out a side dish and charging for it. My water was never refilled."}
{"text":"I'm moving to Chicago tomorrow and if I have one regret, it's that I didn't eat at Mas Amigos enough.
It ruined my day today with its deliciousness, that's what it did.  I had so much I meant to do today, but then I went into Mas Amigos for the vegetarian torta (it's amazing) and a margarita as a reward/break for my industrious morning with a mop.  I had my sandwich, and my giant margarita (I think there was some confusion as to what size I wanted.  Maybe they thought I needed the large.  It's EXTREMELY large) and chips, and by the time I was done I was in no shape to do anything.  I managed to walk home, where I immediately collapsed into a 4 hour coma.  There went my day.
Mas Amigos, it was worth it.  I think I may get another sandwich (But not another margarita, omg) tomorrow."}
{"text":"Very tasty mexican food.  We tried the restaurant because we are big fans of the taco motorizado.  I definitely prefer the taco truck's prices and serving sizes, but if you would prefer to sit indoors, this will do!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yessssssssssss!!!!

Went with my friends J, M and Z, and we ate it up!  We started with their chips and salsa, and the most amazing squirt bottles of avocado crema that HAD to have jalapeno in there because the spice was utter perfection.  We practically squirted this stuff directly into our mouths (I think Z may have put a bottle in his pocket - kidding, but just barely because this stuff was the shit).

Most of my friends had the steak tacos.  I had one too, but I mixed it up a bit by also getting one chorizo and one lengua taco to break up the steak monotony.  All were so good, with the perfect corn tortillas and the perfect amount of diced onion and cilantro.

Deceivingly large place inside for what it looks like on the outside.  Excellent service.

I will return.  I know my friends will too, if they haven't already, because they're local (and I'm jealous)."}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating here since the old hole hole in the wall place. I have to say that was one thing we liked about it was that it was a hole in the wall. 

Since the move I don't think the food is any less quality, the service is still good just has its nights (every place does though). This is still one of the best Mexican food places I feel. 

The steak tacos are great! Pretty much all the taco's are great! The chips and salsa are top notch as well. I also love the Tamale's I would defiantly try this place if your in the Champaign-Urbana area."}
{"text":"They have moved (as of early February 2013) and are now at: 1106 W University Ave
Urbana, IL 61801 (217) 344-6711

Haven't tried them at the new location, but perfectly fine Mexican food when I went there several times at the Springfield Ave restaurant. Very reasonable prices and pleasant staff, good chips and rice and beans. I've had the tamales, tacos and enchiladas, and they're just how Americans like them :) There are other more authentic places I suppose, but there's room in C/U for a place like Mas Amigos too."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first trip to Mas Amigos. I am very impressed with the service, which while might not be as rapid fire (i.e. creepy) as Dos Reales, it is super friendly and they keep the chips and salsa coming. I think I prefer Dos chips and salsa slightly more, but this place has one thing that the big DR doesn't: tortas.

I love tortas, and I love that I can get the most filling item at the restaurant for under $5. And while I do like El Charro, their tortas have nothing on these. Sometimes it is difficult for me to identify where the avocado is in the El Charro rendition, but here they are substantial slices. Everything is just more substantial and tastier. Plus, if you want all the other deliciously greasy food that comes along in a family-style Mexican restaurant, they have that stuff too.

This place is my new jam, fo sho."}
{"text":"I am rarely happy with myself after eating Mexican food in this town. I have had good Mexican food, in Mexico and California, and normally eating Mexican food in this town feels unhealthy and gross.
Mas Amigos is different. The flavors are fresh and you can detect all of the yummy components. None of that monotonous mush we have all grown accustom to.
There tortilla chips are flaky and hearty, they seem homemade although I have never asked. The salsa is good, however I recommend requesting their homemade hot sauces, there is a green and red, they are quite spicy and sooo fresh and tasty.
It is no doubt obvious that I am not an expert on this place.
I have had two dishes here, cheese enchiladas and heuvos a la mexicana, and have enjoyed every bit of them. I am excited to go back and try more. 
Unfortunately, their Margaritas are not great, they come from a slushy machine and that just makes me sad."}
{"text":"What can't I say about this place? It is the best Mexican food in town. The tacos, tortas, burritos, and carne asada are all amazing. The chips, salsa, and the indispensable green sauce are all great and manage to rise above just being food while you wait - they are guaranteed to still be eaten throughout the meal. The only bad menu item I've ever had is the enchilada, which wasn't terrible, but simply okay. The service is perfectly fitting and the environment and location of the restaurant is equally good. I can't speak for authenticity, but everyone else claims it is. It's worth the extra distance from pretty much any local Mexican restaurant you could go to."}
{"text":"My family's first experience here was WAY less than stellar. Table and booth were sticky and gross. Service was slow (waited for drinks, waited for order to be taken (a LONG time - at least 20 minutes) and waited for the food). We were the ONLY people in the restaurant at the time, and we had kids with us, which in most places, means that they try to help you quickly (if only to get you out before the kids start to whine). Two of our four glasses were dirty, smeared with something on the inside. 

Then, when the food came, it was lukewarm and my enchilada sauce was like colored water. No flavor at all, no body to the sauce. The waiter (owner? chef?) was VERY indignant and rude when I gave him my opinion and told him I didn't want the enchiladas. He insulted my taste and my experience with Mexican food (which is extensive). The rest of my family felt their plates were so-so.

I hope my next experience is better. Maybe I should try their food truck instead...hopefully that nasty man won't be there."}
{"text":"This is likely the best Mexican restaurant in town. I ate once at one of Rick Bayless' restaurants (I was sitting in one and ordered off the menu of the other. Yes, weird.) (He's *the* go-to guy on Mexican cuisine in the US, competed on Iron Chef, etc.) I enjoyed my meal at Mas Amigos more.

My wife ordered the Steak with poblanos. It was perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful. The poblano chilis were beautiful.

I ordered the Chicken enchiladas with molé sauce. I am a big sucker for a good molé, and this was a *great* molé. The chef makes the sauce on the premises with dozens of ingredients. It is complex and flavorful. Mmm. Just thinking about it, I almost forgot that the sauce was served with some fabulous chicken enchiladas - tender tortillas wrapped around moist and tender shredded chicken. These are the enchiladas and sauce that the others in town should aspire to be one day.

The chips are also made on the premises. They aren't exactly low-fat, but they knock Chevy's chips to a far distant second. Likewise, the salsas. In addition to the dish of fresh salsa, we were served two made-here bottled (plastic squeeze bottles) salsas: a red, smoky and firey, and a green that reminded me of summertime.

I used to think that the beans and rice at a Mexican restaurant were a very optional part of the meal. Not here. Both are surprisingly tasty and of very good texture.

Although pretty full by the end of the main course, we are suckers for a good Flan. We were not disappointed. Texture and flavor were spot-on.

The service was friendly and attentive.

This place is doing so much right, they really deserve to succeed. We will definitely be returning here often!"}
{"text":"This place has excellent Mexican food. I've come here a few times in my various visits to campus and always try to get something different each time. Service was a little spotty once the place started to get really busy, but the food was definitely worth the wait. Plenty of space and parking at their new location."}
{"text":"The chips are so good. Also recommend the torta. Not sure why reviews are so poor compared to the old location...everything tastes the same as far as I can tell.

Update: Since I was back a second time to this new location, the quality of the food and service seems to have degraded. I don't think I can reasonably rank this as 4 stars even though the chips continue to impress."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in C-U. The food is excellent and the service is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Best Authentic Mexican in town hands down. I was told this by an authentic Mexican. Great Tortas and good drink specials. IT is small and pretty popular so be careful peak times"}
{"text":"Well, since moving the resteraunt I have definitly noticed the service and quality of food has slipped.

We just waited over a half an hour for our lunch. The service was spotty and I noticed that the same item I ordered in the past came noticeably smaller and with out hardly any sides. I had to actually order and pay extra for sour cream, seriously? Many other customers were waiting long periods of time for their food as well and were visibly upset with the server and management.

I think I am done with Mas-Amigos for the time being. They have major management issues and kitchen problems."}
{"text":"This is a great place! They have the best chips I have ever eaten. 

The place is a bit small though."}
{"text":"The tortilla chips are delicious here- we got a basket that were still hot from the fryer.  The salsa was equally delicious, as was the mysterious green sauce our waiter brought to our table.  I have no idea what's in it, but it's flavorful and spicy.  I actually preferred the green sauce to the salsa for my chips.

I chose the fajita quesadilla for my entree- full of grilled vegetables, grilled chicken, and just the right amount of cheese.  My friend ordered the fajitas barbeque, which is chicken and veggies covered in a BBQ-like sauce.  The combination was surprisingly tasty, and I would definitely order that dish again.

The service was excellent and our waiter was very friendly.  However, the margaritas were not very good.  Whatever tequila and mixer combo they use just doesn't work for me- skip these for sure."}
{"text":"Reliably good Mexican food!  I'm a vegetarian and their options are tasty and plentiful.  I love that they started making vegetarian tamales, since I would beg for a meat-free tid-bit of my husband's every time we went!  Standard restaurant decor, and sometimes the heating/cooling in the dining area seems a bit shaky.  Good service and tasty food, a definitely upgrade from Pie-ful Delight (the old inhabitant of this space)."}
{"text":"When it comes to getting Mexican in C-U, this is probably my top pick.  It's cheap, the food I've gotten has been decent (the entrees are probably marginally better at Dos, except for the enchiladas, which are amazing!)  However, I keep coming back because of the chips, which are, in a word, incredible.

I also really enjoy being here.  Very bright atmosphere, and very attentive waitstaff.  Keep the chips coming, and this place is gold."}
{"text":"I've had a variety of dishes here and have loved every one.  The food is usually very fast to come out (but not too fast) and is well-made and delicious.  It's closer to \"authentic\" than many of the other Mexican restaurants in town.  I took a Mexican friend there and he was pleased with the experience.

Beer in a boot glass!"}
{"text":"After growing up in New Mexico, I admit that my only real food bias is probably towards Mexican food.  I hesitate to criticize any ethnic restaurant for lack of authenticity because I operate under the philosophy that good food is good regardless of how \"true\" it is to the original; my experiences with Mexican food in the Midwest have caused me to seriously question that philosophy.  

However, Mas Amigo has cured my hunger for great Mexican food in central Illinois.  

Many Mexican restaurants grab pre-made tortilla chips out of bags and stick them in an oven before serving them to you, creating an illusion that your chips were made \"fresh\" in the restaurant.  Not Mas Amigos!  Their chips are actually fried in the restaurant, and thus have a heavenly flavor and aroma (I've seen the chip fryer in the back!).

I've sampled several items from the menu, but my favorite items have been the tortas, tacos, enchiladas, and tamales:

(1) If you've never tried a torta, but love hearty sandwiches that will send you into a food coma, I suggest ordering the Milanese (breaded steak) torta.  The sandwiches are made with Mexican-style bread/buns, and though they don't come with standard side orders, they compensate with their awesome size.  

(2) While Mas Amigos offers \"Americanized\" tacos (i.e., lettuce and tomatoes), you should really try them with cilantro, onion, and fresh lime juice.  They serve the best pastor (pork) tacos in town, hands-down.  I would also recommend the lengue (tongue) for more adventurous eaters--the meat is always tender and tasty.

(3) I prefer my enchiladas with either verde or mole sauce, and I appreciate that they offer more sauce options for their enchiladas besides \"red or green.\"  

(4) Lastly, I usually try to get a tamale on the side (if I have enough room for it after all those chips--oof!!).  The tamale is served with a cheese sauce, which is good for off-setting the dryness that usually characterizes tamales.

The restaurant always has great wait staff who are attentive and rush your food over after it's prepared.  Oh, and if they don't bring bottles of special chili sauce to your table, DEMAND IT.  This stuff is probably the ambrosia of the Mexican gods.  Most of the time, I find my dinner decision being manipulated by the ability to pour their special chili sauce on my meal (by the way, tortas, burritos, and tacos work best in this capacity)."}
{"text":"No frills mexican...this is your spot!  Love it!  They have amazing greasy chips with lots of different sauces to try out.  I pretty much made a meal out of that.  We got the veggie fajitas and split it.  I liked that there were so many different veggies in it.  The price you cannot beat it.  It was so cheap.  The lights are REALLY bright but other than that, not much to complain about.  The staff was super nice and we just had some cervezas to drink.  Next time I head down to the Paign...I might have to go back to Mas amigos...."}
{"text":"Mas Amigos, I owe you an apology for not upgrading your rating sooner.  I've been back several times since my first review, and you are now one of my favorite restaurants in C-U.

I have to reiterate that the chips and salsa are INCREDIBLE.  And that green sauce (a mixture of avocados, tomatillos, and jalapeños) should really just be poured straight into my mouth from now on.  I want it on everything.  Their lunch specials are cheap and delicious, and for God's sake, order their tacos with onion and cilantro.  Soooo good.

Dos is dead.  Viva Mas Amigos!"}
{"text":"I ate the wonderful fajitas but I longed for the EVERYTHING ELSE they could possibly serve me.  I want to go there all the time...like right now... even though I ate there three hours ago.  I need to make more money."}
{"text":"Eh.  When it was Cocina Real (just a few months ago) ti was one of my favorite places.  But now, even though the menu is almost exactly the same and the people working there are the same, it seems like the food has gone down in quality and quantity.  Nothing comes with your order!  My order of quesadillas - no rice or beans on the side, no salsa or guac.  My friend ordered a burrito - also nothing on the plate but a burrito.  Pretty lame."}
{"text":"I'm coming from CA, so my threshold for good Mexican food is really high.  This place didn't cut it.  Oh well."}
{"text":"I visit my fiance in Savoy, IL once a month and every time I am here we go to this place. I believe the staff is very friendly and the food is great. I like the Tacos de Carne Asada the most, and both my fiance and I love the green sauce (spicy) and the orchata water (rice water). Try to avoid flower tortillas, because if you are having those then maybe you should go to Chillis or On the Border. We both love this place and will miss it, but if we ever come back to Savoy, we are sure to come back to Mas Amigos."}
{"text":"Long trip from Chicago back home to Louisiana. Not far out of the city and we stop at this place. Best mexican hands down. Can't wait to find ourselves within range again."}
{"text":"Cut above most other places in town, making a go of the old Dos Reales #2. Chips and salsa are good."}
{"text":"The cheap, gigantic beer and fantastic tortilla chips have brought me back many times.  

The inconsistent grade of meat used, however, might keep me away for a bit. Sure, you might never know what cut of beef that is in your taco -- but you always know what gristle feels like."}
{"text":"Great service, great food.

The one thing I ask of my waiters is to keep my drink full! Twice here they continuously fill my drink, even after I paid he kept coming back. 

Chips and food are delicious, definetly most authentic I've found in cu. I use to be an el toro regular but finding myself wanting Mas amigos more and more."}
{"text":"I know I can only echo the raving reviews of others, but I think it is important for little places like this to make it. 

The food is to die for.  The chips and salsa are fresh.  Hands down the best homemade tortilla chips I've ever had. My fiance had guacamole which he loved, along with Chorizo burrito and taco which were amazing.  I had the chicken fajitas which were fresh and very well seasoned.  Everything comes with a green and red sauce on the table and the green sauce was especially good.  We put it on everything! The portions are large and the price is small. 

The place itself is pretty small, but it only adds to the charm of it.  The service is the best I've had in a long time.  Give Mas Amigos a try, you will not be disappointed!"}
