{"text":"love this place, homemade dishes, food is cooked to order. I'm there at least once a week, sometimes 2-3 times. The marinated souvlaki is fantastic, love the lemony-garlic flavor. Pita bread is grilled I think and served with practically everything. Took my out-of-towners twice while here, they loved it, everyone had something different, they went crazy for the pita sandwiches and souvlaki platters. The lemon soup is great too. Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place! Our favorites are: we start with the hummus with the pita bread then we order the original Fat Gyro and for dessert the yummy baklava. They also are friendly and have great prices!"}
{"text":"I am dismayed!  I tried calling in an order to find the phone disconnected today..Drove over to find a small sign saying  \"Sorry we are closed for renovations\" I hope this true. They are a fabulous Greek restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, clean dining area & bathrooms. The food was, ok, nothing special. I had a Greek salad with gyro meat. I had asked for no onions but was told the salad is pre-mixed. There were onions but not the end of the world. The lettuce was fresh & crisp. No complaints, just not noteworthy."}
{"text":"Pretty good gyros and fries! I'm glad this place has a drive thru. I use to have to wait forever when I went thru the drive thru, but it has gotten much better. Prices are reasonable and the Greek salads are always fresh."}
{"text":"I ate here on one of my first days in Phoenix. The food was edible, not quite the Greek I'm used to. Not even close to the Greek fast food back in Omaha. For Greek seasoned fries they sure were bland. The gyros were not as flavorful as I am used to either. Service was ok. But then again we were there when it wasn't really busy. When I come back to Phoenix next year I don't think that this will be on my lists of eats."}
{"text":"Love this place, great kabobs and salads."}
{"text":"My husband and I have now eaten here twice and it's become a new favorite. The service is fast but friendly and attentive. The owner made a point of coming to talk to us and thank us for being repeat customers.  We've eaten breakfast and lunch here and found both meals to be satisfying and reasonably priced. I enjoyed the Florentine omelet, especially the fresh spinach and generous use of feta. The addition of peppers and onions to the hash browns is a nice touch.   For lunch, I had the spanakopita and Greek salad. I would have been happy to get the large slice of spinach pie with just the salad on the side but the salad was so generous it came on a plate of its own. My husband had the pork souvlaki with a side salad which was also tasty. We shared the baklava for dessert and it was delicious.  The restaurant is clean and cheerful. The Greek music in the background is fun but low enough that it's easy to carry on a conversation. YaYa would approve."}
{"text":"Awesome thats all i have to say! Plan awesome! Surprise's best lil secret!"}
{"text":"We have frequented this place since moving to Surprise two years ago, The waitstaff has become like friends and within three visits knew our \"usual\" order; including the Philly cheesesteak, just meat and cheese, with a side of buffalo sauce, that my teen lives on.   As many times as we have eaten there, we have had few things to complain about. Always, our happiness with our food is paramount and they are quick to ensure the experience is pleasant and positive."}
{"text":"The food is good but the owners are terrible. They always are bothered if the guest is in need of something and are never empathetic. But last night was the last straw for me. I was in there dining and overheard the owner call one of the employees a \"malaka\" which in Greek is equivalent to the \"n\" word. I was appalled and so was the employee he told the owner that was not his name and he wouldnt respond to that. I will never go back again and spend my money at a place that has no respect for others. On my way out I told the employee he was more than welcome to come work for me, where we treat others with dignity and respect. Do not go here the owners are terrible and inhumane."}
{"text":"They left me waiting to be seated and seemed surprised that I was there. I know I can blend but, really?! Then they didn't come by to take my order for a long while. After this experience I'm sure the CIA could use my blending skills. The falafel platter was decent but the tanini sauce was weak and odd. If you don't mind flagging down the staff it was ok."}
{"text":"OUT OF BUSINESS.  Went by there to eat today and its closed. What a shame. They had wonderful food at a decent price."}
{"text":"We've eaten here 3 times now and I think it's great for fast food, the Gyro's are delicious.  I also appreciate that you can call ahead and just pick up your order in the drive through.  This is one of my fav's."}
{"text":"if you enjoy a Greek environment, good food, and of course a quiet atmosphere this restaurant might be the best place to eat for you. Gyros here are really good made, also they offer you a big salad, and a big menu full of options. I went  to take the lunch with my boyfriend and I can say he enjoyed the food as much as I did. The restaurant environment is charming Greek looking, they play from Greek pop music to folkloric. Is family friendly,quiet, and very clean."}
{"text":"Overall a pathetic and weak excuse for a Gyro.  The pita was slightly stale and chewy and there was so little meat here that it was lost in the pita, I feel cheated. The tzatziki sauce truly ruined it for me, it was unusually sweet and off putting, I've never tasted anything like it."}
{"text":"GREEK LEMON SOUP.  It is what is supposed to be, delicate, soft and gentle comfort food.  5 alarm chili it is not.  Lemon soup it is."}
{"text":"Great food!  Got the chicken and pork skewer plate, which was perfectly cooked.   Check this place out if you like Greek food!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on 1/22 for a Gyro and it was delicious.  Take out service was fast and friendly.  I want to go back and try the Pistachio.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  Prices very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE !!!! I work right next door and can not stop eating their delicious food. The food is amazing and the service is great. I have eaten Greek food for years and I have to say this place is hands down the best I have had. The Gyro meat is juicy and thick, the salads are large and fresh, and the pricing is pretty good considering the quality of the food the serve. No joke, I think I have eaten at the place everyday for a month and I will admit I frequently stop by to pick up food from them in the drive thru on the way home."}
{"text":"Bad enough the first time I probably won't try it again...  Waited 20 minutes for a standard gyro and fries, fries were good but those aren't Greek so I don't count them.  Gyro meat was cold and tasteless and the pita was crusty."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time time today, and it was great! A Greek guy I know said this is the best American made Greek food he has had outside of New York! Support this place... we need more independent places in Surprise!"}
{"text":"I finally made it here!! Been looking forward to it and never made it.   I was a little confused because I thought we would order at the counter and then wait for our order, but a very nice waitress asked us to have a seat at one of the tables and she waited on us as in a regular sit down restaurant. That was great!   There were 5 of us on our early dinner group and we each ordered something different. We started with the traditional humus which was good, I wanted more flavor.   We all tried from each others plates, and all of them were great!! And the portions are huge!! I took half of my meal home and had it for lunch today and the meat was still beautiful.   I would recommend the stuffed grape leaves, the lamb was so tender also. It was a great meal and so very affordable.   I'm going back to try their flavored humus..."}
{"text":"Updating my review to keep it fresh (and we like them and want them to stay in business).  The food is great as always and the service has improved.  We visit usually weekly, and they always remember us.  We feel like \"family!\""}
{"text":"I was not impressed! I had Greek salad and moussaka and another pasta dish together! The salad had no flavor like they forgot something in the dressing! The food was plentiful but tasteless! My husband had gyro he's had the real thing in Greece and he said it was just okay! I don't know if we will return unless we hope to try something else with the hopes that it might be better than what we had! When we walked in did not know if we should sit or order at counter no one greeted us so my husband had to find someone in back to ask!"}
{"text":"* now out of business * A few hits and too many misses...won't be ordering from them again. Soggy stuffed grapes leaves, cucumbers wilted, yuck. Initially I liked this place."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I havent updated my reviews on this place until now. I've been a guest at My Greek Corner many times since my previous review and have yet to have a bad meal. The portions are generous, the service is friendly and nice. They even do restaurant night fundraisers for the schools which was a pleasant surprise!   They have adjusted the consistency of the hummus since my last visit and it's much thicker and creamier than it was in my initial visit. Plus the side salad is a lot more proportionate. They've come a long way in the 2 years since my first review.   If you haven't been to MGC or haven't been back in a while, give it another try. I think you'll be pleasantly pleased with what you find there!"}
{"text":"Very good food, good service. I didn't expect to be seated like a regular restaurant due to all the previous reviews saying it was fast food and totally didn't expect the food to taste better than fast food!  I had the spanikopita and Greek salad which was great. HUGE spanikopita... Could not eat it all.   I also tried my friends lamb gyro and the stuffed olive leaves... Very good as well.   I suggest it for your Greek hunger and for your frugal wallet.  I left paying only $10 or so, not including tip."}
{"text":"Bummer this place closed, it was decent greek food at a good price. The burger, fries,feta were pretty good. Liked to visit when in az."}
{"text":"This is seriously good Greek Food. Really nice, family run, super friendly. The salad was huge and so tasty. Also had the spanikopita and tiropita combo. I am a meat eater and yet these two veggie dishes filled me up so much, I brought home left-overs for the next day.   Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"And that's not a bad-3 star! Very clean, very friendly Greek place and the food is good.  Not as good as some on the west side.  Maybe #3 in my book....but good.  And their Taramatsolata (sp?) is very flavorful.  We do go back when we're in the area.  There are a hell of a lot of restaurants around here that are not nearly as good."}
{"text":"Every week me and my bff (+her bf) attempt to try something new and not to sucky out in the land of Surprise. You know what they say, Surprise, it sucks.   Anyhoo.. My Greek Corner is the first fast food Greek place in Surprise and as of now, the only Greek food place (Sorry Mikes, you don't count). The menu is short and carries the basics plus a few Italian and American favorites thrown in for good measure. We tried the Humus Spread and the #4 Traditional Gyro Pita.. you always have to try the basics to best guess the rest of the menu. Well... the humus, meh, I make a pretty mean humus myself and we were not impressed. While thick and hearty it lacked any sort of garlic, tahini, etc.. seemed like chickpeas, and lemon juice. It served with pita \"chips\" meaning they grease up some pita bread and bake it off, could have broken a tooth if you werent careful. Hot and soft pita bread would have been much better with the humus.   The Gyro Pita was fantastic and made up for the so-so humus. Layers of tender sliced gyro meat piled high on chewy flat bread, then topped with delicious and creamy tzatziki, onions and tomato. Delish. The french fries that came with the combo were decent, and for 8.50 seemed like a pretty good deal, oh, that included a pop too, Pepsi products, yay!!  So if you're out in Surprise and have the taste for a some Greek action, hmmmm, Greek action.. go ahead and pull on to the drive thru and get some Greek to go!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a couple of times since they opened.  Each time I request to have my pita bread toasted so that it will be hot , instead of having a cold gyro sandwich.  I feel the staff doesn't care about the customers."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and it won't be happening again. The food was not good, in my opinion. I usually get the chicken pita at these joints. Here the chicken was tough and tasteless. Oh, and over priced.  My friend got a Greek salad in a pita and, after inspecting the contents, found that there was lettuce and very little else. We brought this up to the server who said with a shrug, \"That's just how they're made.\"  Pretty good way to lose two customers."}
{"text":"My Greek Corner serves breakfast in addition to lunch and dinner.  They are conviently located near the corner of Grand & Bell. I've stopped by now a couple of times for lunch and find this place A~OK.  They have a wide variety menu with a mixture of Greek/Italian/American which is somewhat confusing since they are a Greek restaurant. Where else can you get a Gyro along with some Buffalo wings and a fried fish sandwich and a steak...   Food ~ Gyros are very good with a generous portion of layered sliced gyro meat cooked very well high, not dry, on heated chewy flat bread, topped with their creamy tzatziki sauce, onions and tomato. It is very good and what I come back for.  Their french fries are seasoned and ok. Their Hummus and Greek salads are not on my order again list. I do like their chicken and lamb souvlaki combo with rice and a salad.   Service is very friendly and accommodating. They have a drive through if you want to order something to go.  I suggested on my last visit, they might benefit by tailoring their menu down somewhat and remove some of the odd options and be more focused on their Greek food.   A solid place for a Gryos or Souvlaki if your in this area.  I plan to try their breakfast on my next visit.   Promo plug: they are offering a \"BOGO\" deal on their Gryos ~ buy one get one 1/2 price, so take a friend with you! I asked how long this offer last, and apparently it has been going on for a while now and will continue."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant and we go there at least 2-3 times a month. Surprise needs a family-owned restaurant that is affordable and has great food - and this one fits the bill.   I have tried other Greek places in the west valley and never returned to any of them - I had given up on Greek food fantasies until we discovered My Greek Corner.   My absolute favorite that I get almost every time we go is the lamb souvlaki. It's amazing. Perfectly spiced and perfectly cooked every time. The salad is always fresh and the pita bread is the freshest I've had since moving to AZ 5years ago. We also love the spanikopita and tirokopita - both fabulous.  Also as a bonus the prices are incredibly reasonable and the portions are huge.  And I love that it is not a chain, people in AZ are so into chain restaurants it's a breath of fresh air.  Especially in the West valley.  Love it!!"}
{"text":"My wife an I went to My Greek Corner twice this last holiday weekend. On Saturday I had the Gyro platter with Greek rice, seasoned fries, and a salad $8.95. I thought the portions were great for the money. I couldn't finish the salad and fries, and I am a big guy that can pack away some food. The Gyro meat is cut thicker than most places, some pieces as much as a 1/4 inch thick. I really liked this, I was impressed. Also the gyro meat didn't seem as greasy as I have experienced at other Greek places. It was lean and full of flavor. The rice was nice and light, good flavor and tender. The fries were good, but I had asked for the Greek fries with feta but they missed it on the order. I wasn't charged the $.50 for the feta so I didn't mention it. The Greek salad that came with the meal was large and unexpected. i didn't realize the platter came with one. The dressing was very light and could stand a little more flavor. It had large pieces of cucumber (yum) red onion, (thin sliced) and feta cheese. One olive and pepper chiene. All good just need a little more flavor in the dressing. The tzatziki sauce was thicker than most, I liked it since it was easy to spread in the pita pieces with out dripping all over the plate. The pita is AWESOME. Soft, warm, and yummy.   I really liked everything I tried.   The Wife got the chicken gyro with fries. She is not a traditional gyro fan but she really liked the chicken gyro. This says a lot since she agreed to go back again for another one Monday. :) She got the same minus the fries since the gyro is so big she had a hard time finishing it both times and she let some fries go to waste on the first try because she was saving room for her yummy chicken gyro. The portions are great for the price.   The second trip I got the traditional gyro with a Greek salad and a chicken kabob on the side to try. The gyro was just as good as the platter. The chicken kabob meat was moist and tender. I liked it and the wife tried a few bites and she enjoyed it too.   All in all we enjoyed this new spot in Surprise and will be back for more."}
{"text":"We just moved to Surprise, so the drive through has been very convenient on those days we look like heck, and have no food to cook, and a lot of errands to run, etc.   The kids have had the burgers and chicken strips, and they loved them.  The hubby has had the avacado burger and double cheese burger, and both have been pretty good. I took a bite of his double, and it was a great burger.  The fries are yummy.  I had a gyro, and it was really good! It was so over stuffed.  I also had a chicken souvlaki meal with rice and the salad, and it was so good.  I was starving by the time we ate, but still it was so yummy.  The pita is perfect.  I am glad to have this place close.    For the few bad things... I didn't like the hummus and the prices are a little high."}
{"text":"had greek corner again last night.  thought I would mention that they changed their fries.  previously they were using large thick steak fries which were kind of bland.  They are now using thinner crispier natural cut herb seasoned fries which are very good.  The Gyro was still amazing."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this business. First of all tried to make this same comment view able to Facebook but \"they\" as in owners deleted it. So here I am now. Was told that business was going to be undergoing a remodel that would take 7 days,. 7th day came about and heard nothing. Well found out they decided to close for good and have an Einsteins Bagels be put in instead. Never told the employees just left. Very rude. Its unfortunate was an amazing place to eat. I could say worse things but I'm not that type of person. But have mercy on whoever they employee in the future. Good luck with your Einsteins."}
{"text":"This place has wonderful food and service. The restaraunt is clean, the servers have always been nice (especially when it comes to explaining some of the foods served here) and the food always arrives in a timely fashion as well. They put a good amount of meat in the gyro as well whereas other places we've been too do not. They have reasonable prices and are always offering a buy one get one 1/2 gyro special."}
{"text":"This joint was a 3 until last night...  I always check take-out orders, but since this place had never messed up an order previously I didn't check very close -- just a quick glance at the items: 2 gyros, a regular order of fries (= seasoned), and feta fries. Check, check, check.  Well, naïve and optimistic me, I get home and there's no tzatziki sauces on the side (the gyros were sauceless, as ordered), and neither order of fries are seasoned. Dang it...  So I call and they say no problem, come in and we'll give you new fries and of course some sauce. I'm a little peeved that that's all they offer, but whatever, it's late and I'm hungry. So I drive the ~10 minutes back and they've now decided that I only get ONE new order of the regular (seasoned) fries and ONE gddmn side of sauce, but they'll give me a little cup of seasoning. WTF?! For my non-existent fries that I ate on the way back because, y' know, it was late and I was hungry. If I HADN'T eaten them, they'd be cold anyway!  Did I mention that my 8 1/2 month pregnant wife is now sitting at home with a cold gyro?  The guy who is actually helping me keeps having to go talk to another guy in the kitchen, and when I press the issue, he just comes back with \"That's all we can do.\" O rly? Well, all I can do is pull the irate ex-customer card and post this review and tell everyone in town to avoid you like the plague.  I had no interest in arguing further over an order of fries and a cup of tzatziki sauce, so I cut my losses and head home to cold food.   I swear it seems they may have changed ownership/management, because a handful of previous experiences showed that while this place has very generically average but passable fast casual greek fare, the service had a kind of genuine local business sincerity. But since they're not the only gyro game in town now, we'll be taking our business elsewhere.  Speaking of, why do so many locally-owned businesses have such crappy customer service?? With a couple exceptions (Chick-fil-A, Wendy's), we rarely eat chain/franchise fast food, but when we do and there's a problem, they practically throw themselves at our feet and replace EVERYTHING without question, either right then or on a future visit."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a new Greek restaurant in Surprise and was happy to hear my girlfriend was going to pick up lunch from them today.    By the time I got to the table at home she already had a disgusted look on her face.  She said that the humus tasted like the stuff you get from a bag or box and add water to.  I tried it and it just tasted like nothing but ground chickpeas to me.  I was disappointed.  There are a fair number of decent Greek and Mediterranean restaurants in the valley and having bland somewhat watery humus is definitely going  to hurt  your business among people that like Greek food.  My poor girlfriend looked even worse after biting into her gyro.  She is a little bit of a picky eater.  I told her that the gyro was probably just prepared a little different from what she normally liked.  She likes the meat to be seared on the grill or griddle a bit.  She pushed it aside and proceeded to try her vegetables.  I tried her discarded gyro while noticing that her vegetables looked like they had been boiled to death or sat under a heat lamp forever.  At first the gyro seemed fine, but after the second or third bite I noticed that the meat tasted a little off.  I'm not sure what it was, but it definitely was not what I'm used to.  My chicken Gyro was fine.  The meat was a little tough, but well seasoned.  The fries were seasoned well, but soggy.    We will try it again down the road once it has time to mature, but they need to kick it up a notch to compete with places like Mike's, George's, Greek Wraps and the list goes on and on.  They also need to realize that most people will drive a little for decent Greek and Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The food has always been good, i've tried about 8 different things and never disappointed.  The quantity of food is VERY generous and i am always stuffed.  The prices are decent, not cheap, but not more than a large combo at McDonalds and it's way better.  I've never been inside since they have a drive through and i'd rather eat at home watching TV.  the drive thru is slow, but i'm sure going in isn't any faster.  The staff has always been helpful, answering my stupid questions of \"what is a blah?\"!"}
{"text":"Gyro to die for and an authentic Greek menu. Everything I have had (25 plus visits) is always tasty, hot and memorable. Not a white tablecloth restaurant, but clean and inviting just the same.  The staff is quite friendly and always willing to explain the menu items for us novices. If you are in the mood for some Greek food made by those who know how, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Sadly My Greek Corner has CLOSED.  Hope another Greek restaurant does open in Surprise area soon.  Now an Einsteins.  Well a good bagel is ok I guess"}
{"text":"I reviewed this place before but they must have taken it down as my review might have been a bit \"too real\".  First off, check out my other reviews... As a former small business owner of a restaurant and bar, (4 star Yelp review, 3 1/2 star yelp review respectively) I would never bash somebody's business as it is their lifeblood, how they pay themselves and how they take care of their families.    That being said, maybe I caught this place on the worst night ever.  The Owner/Manager seemed cocky and very concerned with what I thought of his vehicle.  Very nice car for the guy who operates the best Greek eatery. (Best Greek on the Corner of Bell and Grand, that is.)  The guy who took my order seemed like he was also way too cool for school.  After asking a couple menu questions and getting some cocky and arrogant answers, I placed my order and the wait was on.    20 minutes later, I was in the car with my to go Greek. I got home ,checked everything out and dug in.  That's when tragedy struck.  Besides the generous portion of Chicken I got, the food was bland.  The Spanakopita was dry.  The rice, which they somehow decided to trademark the name of, is awful and has peas in it.   Didn't try the Gyros as that is not real Greek food.  If it was My Gyro Corner Restaurant, things might be different.  I go to Greek places for Greek and I go to Gyro places for Gyros.    All of this has me saying \"Eek! Methinks not.\""}
{"text":"This place is great. They have relatively cheap food, but it is still delicious. The customer service is superb and that is what I focus on. I always appreciate a kind person."}
{"text":"LOVE THE GYRO! I'm from NJ and attended Rutgers University. For anyone who knows the Grease Trucks, this GYRO brought me back to the college days of inexpensive amazingly authentic GYRO's. I know the owners of this place are true Greeks, so perhaps you don't know Greek food too well if you don't think this is authentic.   Highly recommend dinner here...also great and convenient for take out- as they have a drive througth!"}
{"text":"What's this? A drive-thru Greek restaurant? How good can that be?  About as good as you'd expect. The prices and food were more of the 'meh' quality. Same generic gyro meat you'll find anywhere else, topped with your usual tomato, onions, and so-so tzatziki. You can add a side for $2.50, but the fries, salad, and even rice all looked or tasted bland and boring.  Don't lose interest yet, this place saves itself from two-star territory. I like the beverage selections, with the imported Greek lager and the varieties of S. Pellegrino (Aranciata? Limonata? Yes!).  Where this place really shines is the dessert. They tasted more original, and almost homemade. My traditional baklava was above average, and I needed help finishing one triangle.  If I come here again, it will probably be to-go. The interior felt like a Long John Silver's. Summary: Solid Greek lunch at a reasonable price. Give it a chance."}
{"text":"Disappointed to report they're now closed, no longer open. Too bad, we liked it."}
{"text":"Meh Greek Restaurant.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad.  It was no Z's Greek on Indian School, but it wasn't bad.  I had the Gyro Platter.  The Greek salad was fine, the gyro was fine although I prefer it done a bit more.  The rice was ok and the veggies on the side...they tasted ok but here's where they dropped from 3 stars down to 2.  There were parts of the broccoli and such that were not normally meant for mammals lacking multiple stomach's.  Numerous tough, fiberous bites that had to be spit out or regurgitated to chew on later, as you wish.  The service was friendly and the people were nice. If I hadn't been in a hurry I might have sent it back or changed to a different side."}
