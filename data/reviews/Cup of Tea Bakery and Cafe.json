{"text":"Had lunch with a friend, amazing vegan chilli and deserts and seed loaf very good, check it out."}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time. I am new to eating gluten free and I have to say what a treat. I purchased buns, cookies and bars. Delicious. I will most definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"Bakery goods - 4/10 Tea - 8/10 Customer service - 2/10  I bought an organic chocolate chip cookie sandwich and an organic chocolate cupcake with vanilla buttercream.   The cookie was too sweet and the buttercream was hard, almost solid. The cupcake was dry but had a good cocoa flavour. Same issue with the buttercream. At $1.75 for the cookie and $2.50 for the cupcake, it was disappointing to my palate and my wallet.  I bought a loose tea sampler which is good to brew two cups. The tea was quite good. I may come back to buy this. Cost was $1.00.   The major reason I hesitate to return is the customer service I received. It's a tiny store and only one other customer before me. There was no greeting or a smile. A terse \"Can I help you with something?\" was all I got. Attempts at pleasant conversation were met with a stony and impatient face. Questions regarding the tea were answered. However when I inquired about a price list or more information like a menu, all I got was \"We don't have that\". No follow-up about what kind of info did I need or product or flavours. Just nada.   The person serving was in a hurry to get to the back. I get it. You're probably busy with orders. Well, let me alleviate you of more work. It's doubtful I'll ever buy or order anything from there."}
{"text":"Oshawa is lacking in Tea shops (especially those that sell loose-leaf) and the \"Cup of Tea Bakery and Cafe\" is only one of two in the area. A fair selection of teas for sale and assorted tea ware. The main attraction seems to be the baked goods. Three people ahead of me in line all bought some of the gluten free and organic treats such as squares, cookies and cupcakes. There isn't any room inside to sit down and enjoy a cup, but you can get any of their assorted teas/coffees to go.  (Side note) I was a little surprised at first when I was handed a cup of Rooibos tea with the leaves just floating in the compostable cup . When the employee put the lid on, it all made sense. I have never seen this before, but the lid contains a filter and it worked perfectly. The leaves got to steep and none came through while drinking."}
{"text":"Organic and Gluten Free baked goods for sure is the main attraction at Cup of Tea Bakery and Cafe.   They carries wide range of loose leaf tea, which are all prepackaged in 50 g and ranged from $5 and up. You can smell all the different kind of tea in air tight plastic containers at your leisure.   For the baked goods, there are good selections of Organic Cookies ($1) which I find it reasonable.. not only they all look tempting delicious, they tasted great too!! The chocolate cookies I got have chucks of chocolate inside.. and not too sweet..   BTW, Cup of Tea Bakery and Cafe is Nut Free.. so if you have family or friends that are allergic to nuts, you can rest assure that the sweets you got is good for them! Also if you have special dietary and health needs, Cup of Tea Bakery and Cafe can made special orders bakery goods just for you!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite gluten free spots in Durham Region. I know a new owner took over about a year ago and I think you can certainly taste the difference.  The cookies and squares and always fresh, no freezer burnt taste like they used to be. They've added some great lunch options and their gluten free pizza dough is by far the best I've had in years!"}
{"text":"I have nothing but amazing things to say about this bakery. I was in need of a vegan cake in 24 hours and had called several other bakeries that could not accommodate. When I spoke with the new owner of Cup of Tea Bakery and Caf√© he was nothing but accommodating. On the day that I went to pick up the cake he went above and beyond. The cake was so beautiful and personalized with vegan fondant. The owner was extremely personable and showed me some of his other works. The cake itself was delicious and was praised at the event I took it to. I will be returning for more of their delicious goodies and bread! If you are in need of a regular cake or cake for certain allergies or dietary preferences, do not hesitate to order from this bakery."}
