{"text":"Have gone here quite a few times! Love their croissant sandwiches, lots of food for the money considering other places charge 8 or 9 for a smaller size sandwich. I tried the brocoli and cheese soup and it's the reason for the 4 not 5 stars. It was a really unappealing grey green color, very grainy as well as the only flavor I could taste was black pepper. Not sure if I got a bad batch, but I had high hopes and won't be trying that again. My only other negative was it took forever when I went in to order, it would of been faster to have it delivered which sounds crazy but true. Their delivery is awesome and very fast, without a doubt a great feature. So just a tip, deliver or call ahead to pick up :)"}
{"text":"DISHONEST WITH CHARGES. 

My order total was $8.75. When the order arrived the bill was closer to $11.00. When I questioned it, I received a blank stare. I guess they are not use to people paying attention to the bill. Pay attention to the charges, they will try to over charge if you don't catch it."}
{"text":"The Good
*Tasty honest food
*Fast delivery service
*Really friendly staff
*Reasonably priced

The Bad
*Odd location
*Dining area could use some remodeling
*No website

The Bottom Line
If you work in or around the Scottsdale Airpark Lucy's is a great spot for a delicious and affordable lunch.

Review
I've been a regular at Lucy's Cafe for the past five years. The food is simple and tasty with the best items being the Lucy's Club, Teriyaki Chicken Bowl, French Fries, and the Bowtie Pasta Salad. The staff of this family run cafe are extremely friendly and seem to always recognise repeat customers. The restaurant itself is oddly nestled in the corner of a small office complex and the dining area could do with a little remodeling. If you work in the area and can't leave the office for lunch then you're in luck. Lucy's offers a delivery service the is pretty fast and a real lifesaver if you're stuck in the office. However, you'll need to pick up a menu while in the restaurant since they don't have a website."}
{"text":"Oh this place is fabulous! I modified the \"Croissant Delight\" #1 by 86-ing  the turkey  and adding egg instead  it's THE BEST bfast sandy I've had."}
{"text":"I order from Lucy's from time to time for breakfast and/or lunch delivery for my office. Always delivers in a timely manner! Portions are good sized and the food has always been fresh and delicious. Each person I've spoken to when placing orders have been gracious and kind, the delivery men are also amazing! Definitely recommend if in the North Scottsdale area and looking for a variety of delivery options!"}
{"text":"I found Lucy's on Google Maps and decided to visit this little establishment.  It was convenient and near my workplace.  I'm so glad I picked this venue for lunch!  Staff was super friendly and is family owed.  I LOVE small cafe such as this place, they always have great food and service!  I got the Thai Chicken Wrap with Peanut sauce and a side of fries.  The wrap was amazingly good and very light!  Just what I was looking for.  I couldn't believe that they incorporated the taste of a Vietnamese spring roll into this wrap, x the vermicelli noodles of course but it was such a great twist to the taste with Hoinsin!  I am loving my Thai Chicken Wrap! The owner also informed me that they deliver and to just call next time!  What a GEM of a restaurant I've found!  I will def be ordering from them again and be spreading the news about them.  Good find for the day!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I have been to Lucy's twice now and I have been pleased with my meals. The first time I stopped by I ordered a sandwich and it was delicious. There are just too many chain restaurants around the valley, so I love to try something new. I will be a frequent customer!"}
{"text":"This place has the greatest small diner feel WITH delivery. The best of both worlds. Burgers are amazing and the chili cheese fries will make you drool!!!!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service and sells expired food. A manager working here gave me a hard time when returning a few dollars worth of items they sold me which were passed there expiration date at the time of sale."}
{"text":"Really good food, great prices and you only have to spend $10.00 for delivery. Great place!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here a handful of times!! We usually get it delivered to our office but I pick it up once in a while.. Friendly staff and food is always correct and delicious!! Will continue to be a patron of Lucy's!! 

Excellent Breakfast and Lunch spot!"}
{"text":"This place is really not too shabby! I almost feel bad only giving 3 stars, but it's nothing to write home about. It's just terribly convenient, given that I work next door.

The staff is friendly. They've got ginormous breakfast croissants. They have spicy ramen noodles which are actually very tasty, and they actually manage to make them a bit spicy! Bundle that all up and add a bow of very decent prices, and I call this place a win. I've been finding myself there a good few times recently. Matter of fact, just yesterday I had both lunch and breakfast over there!"}
{"text":"This ah natural  store/restaurant  is a nice spot to hVe breakfast I had the buttermilk pancakes wife had crabby pant omlet service great food hit the spot"}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant is so close to work I thought why not try it. Was a little nervous after looking at the menu but tried the Cobb Salad. Very impressed!! It's fresh and hardy. I love the size of the dressing and the addition of a breathe mint was refreshing. So glad I stopped!!"}
{"text":"This place is the worst. the food is not that tasty and the soup is no good.  the delivery guy Henry short changes you and is rude and in appropriate. they need to look at the menu and make some changes to keep up. I would pay a little more for good food, but they are over priced for dry sandwiches and hard bread."}
{"text":"I have lunch here all the time. Staff is really friendly, always gets my order right, and remembers me. If you're looking for Asian food, they do it really well here. they use quality ingredients. No fast food kind of ingredients here. The salads always fresh and the chicken and rice are always cooked right. 
The restaurant is clean and cool inside, and the people are really nice. Just a really welcoming environment."}
{"text":"I had a chicken stir fry. Nothing was stir fried! A bed of white rice with steamed vegetables and very dried shredded chicken breast meat covered with a teriyaki graze. Pour quality! Will never return!!!"}
{"text":"Great place. My office is very close the cafe and I always stop here for lunch. The food is extremely cheap and tastes great!"}
{"text":"I had a good experience with their delivery service but the last 2 times it has taken over an hour to receive my order. My office is only 0.73 miles from their location. The latest time I called them back twice and was simply given a \"sorry about that\" response. I do not plan on ordering from here again."}
