{"text":"Showed up 30 mins before buffet ended and was told they are just closing it down. There's food still on it though. Got a deal on remains though. Great flavour and staff weren't rude. Clean tables, well stocked. Big dining area. Signs are older and fading. Good enough for a quick bite, but I may not be back and I won't be bringing company with me. Maybe the delivery is better."}
{"text":"Food is very bland. Ordered the chicken pad Thai. All I got was noodle and chicken..... Nothing else. Seriously the most boring meal I have ever had."}
{"text":"Recently, my friends and I went to this place several times. Surprisingly, it is one of the good places to sit down, talk and eat. Every time, I usually ordered Malaysian dishes as I, particularly like Malaysian food so much. This place really gave me a good dining experience every time and I felt so fulfilled with my ordered food - KL Fried Noodle, Mango Fish, Prawns with Yellow Curry, Spicy Devil Fish, Black Pepper Crab and Bak Kut Teh. You will never forget its finer flavor..."}
{"text":"Service is excellent and food is great, but the portions are VERY small for the price. Lunch special is $8.5, and dinner is around $12 offering the same menu, but the thing is, the portion is the same even with the price change.   I've gotten take out from this place at lunch time twice and also ate in the restaurant a few times. I ordered the same thingsfor take-out and eat in and noticed the portion is VERY OFF. I got the black pepper chick when i was eating in and it was a great portion, but the take out portion was almost half the size.   If they can be more consistent and increase their portions, I would definitely give it 5 stars. For now, I will only recommend lunch if you eat in and not dinner."}
{"text":"It's the only Chinese food I eat in Ajax. I recommend ordering their menu items. I will admit I'm not too crazy about the buffet here or in any other Chinese restaurants. But the reason why I am a regular here is because their #77 noodle dish is my ideal Chinese noodle dish and I'm pretty picky when it comes to Chinese noodle dishes. First of all I like rice vermicelli noodles instead of egg noodles ( ie Cantonese Chow Mein) and I love their version of this rice vermicelli noodle dish. It's my usual and because of this dish they know it's me when I call in to order it.  Anyways I digress...  Chinese food is subjective to some (or most). But I recommend this place because if you like large portions and you want to eat Chinese food that's not Manchu Wok or a as pricey as Mandarin go here. Order from the menu. Forget the cheap buffet!"}
{"text":"Stuck in traffic so I pulled of the hiway to get a bite. Glad I did great food reasonable price."}
{"text":"Food was ok I guess. Portions are small. Price slightly higher than comparable Chinese places in the area. Only came here cause it's close to the office. The restaurant was almost empty at 1pm on a Friday."}
{"text":"Ive had better asian cuisine elsewhere. They have the typical dishes any takeout restaurant has just cheaper prices. It's better to come for their lunch buffet instead of dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on a weekend. Waited a bit to sit down, the food took forever to arrive. They apologized and gave us a dessert, which still showed up on our bill, luckily my ever careful mom checked.   We ordered: Singapore chicken on rice- rice did not have enough chicken flavour, chicken was average. Good, but not special. Sambal paste on fish- Basically shrimp paste on top of pan fried fish. Spicy. I didn't super like the sambal paste, but that might be my lack of experience having Malaysia food. I did like the fish.  Bak Kit Teh- My favourite for this meal. A soupy dish with pork belly. My parents said the medicinal flavour could be stronger.  Green chicken curry in coconut- it's average. It's slightly sweeter than I thought but I like it. There's pineapple in the curry.  Sticky rice with mango- unfortunately they hit my pet peeve, the mango is sour. If mango is not ripe, please just take the item off the list.   If the food didn't take so long, this might be a 3 star. Between how long it took, the sour mango and average food, this store is only 2 star."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food outside of Markham. It's great that they don't douse your food with soy, salt, sauce and msg. The food is fresh and flavourful. The portions are huge and the prices are great!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty and the prices were average. I felt like the food was a mix of Chinese and south east asian flavours.  Green chicken curry - presentation was nice and the flavour was decent  Special shrimp rolls - just imagine a fried Sui Mai  Sambal shrimp with tomato paste - tasted like sweet and sour pork to me but with shrimp. I would have preferred pork.  Curry okra - average Some meatballs dish - Tasty meatballs in a curry creamy flavour. This and the green chicken curry were my favourite Pineapple fried rice - decent...rice was a little chewy to me Curry Roti - decent"}
{"text":"This restaurant can be quite busy at lunch time and afternoon. May be I have high expectation of this place, but the curry beef brisket, curry ox tongue, green curry chick in coconut are no good. I suspect they use those Japanese package curry for curry beef. Roti curry sauce is way too watery.  pork cutlet suppose to be their signature dish, I find it average.  Sambal pawn #404 and Malaysian french toast are good.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Best place in Ajax for real high quality Chinese food. Decor is not fancy but food is very well prepaired. Price is resonable. I know this place for about 4 years, never have any problems with food. My favorite Saigon Chicken, Spicy pork chops, Hot and Sour soup with shrimps,  Shu-mai, har-goo, barbeque short ribs."}
{"text":"An update. Tried their curry and also the Kuala lumpar fried noodles, baked portugese chicken on rise, the skewers on the appetizers, roti canai, and cheesecakes and milk tea. The fried noodles were spicy and really tasty, actually had a kick to it. I would order it again. The curry was good also but more about average. We didn't mind the skewers but it was nothing special.  The roti was great, as usual and we ordered two, knowing full well we would devour them both. Their milk tea is similar to Teh Tarik which is made the Malaysian style way where they mix it in a shaker (or two cups) by using long pours between the two halves of the shaker (or cups) (and repeating it a few times) in order to create some frothiness in the drink.  The baked Portuguese chicken took awhile to come, as they have to make it, then bake it and it was pretty tasty.  The service was great and I can't wait to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Asian Delight does not serve authentic South East Asian cuisine.  All the dishes we ordered were timid in flavours.  So get this expectation out of your mind.    Based solely on the deliciousness, the food is a OK.  We ordered a few dishes.  I can solidly recommend the deep fried chicken wings with shrimp sauce.  Pretty bold in flavour.  The stir fried bean tasted of a mix of sambal and chili sauce (yap, not authentic).  It actually tasted pretty good, if you can tolerate the spiciness, cause the beans swam in sauce.  The satay looked funny cause they were completely covered in sauce.  It tasted alright, but as mentioned, not bold enough.  The lamb satay was the best, and the beef satay was disappointing.  I can't recommend the Hainanese chicken.  It tasted like regular plain chicken.  The texture was tender and moist, though.  It is way over priced at $12."}
{"text":"Came here on based on a recommendation for a Malaysian friend. He has never been here before, but he knows the chef personally (who recently joined this restaurant).  This small Asian restaurant has a South Easy Asian theme to their menu.  The Hainanese Chicken and Hainanese Rice are ordered and served separately.. both were just so-so. Chicken was just regular chicken.. and rice was flavourless.."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my parents. Portions are small. $10 for the 'four of kinds' veggie dish - the 4 veggies being eggplant, mushroom, okra and green beans. It tasted good but was a little too oily. $12 for half of hainanese chicken - the chicken was slightly salty. $10 for pad thai - the pad thai was a disappointment, especially since this was a malaysian restaurant. The flavor just wasn't there. $10 for pineapple fried rice - Normally restaurants serve the rice in half of a pinapple, but here they only served a slice of the pineapple.   Their pulled milk tea was good.  They are doing soft opening right now, probably going to change up the menu."}
{"text":"Food is a little bit salty and a lot of stuff in the menu is crossed off. Overall the pad Thai and roti was not bad. The server is the owner and she is super friendly and nice."}
{"text":"2.5 star  Asian Delight is trying to be everything.   Hong Kong Style Cafe during lunch?  Malaysian and Chinese during dinner?  Karaoke Cafe at night?  Lunch Special is $8.50 which includes a soup and a drink. There are quite a few items to choose from including some Hong Kong Style cafe items and Malaysian dish.   Curry Laksa ($8.50) with the Soup of the Day Cream of Ham was disappointing. The soup tasted bland and the noodle was so overcooked as it was so soggy. Soup was really watery and lack any spices.   Service though was excellent as I was there at 11:15 am and the restaurant was empty.  I would be back to give Asian Delight another try. I really wish they could be better as there is not too many \"good\" Malaysian/Singaporean Restaurants in the area."}
