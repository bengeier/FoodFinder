{"text":"Great value for the price you pay and always accomodating for the kids. Staff does a great job of monitoring the floor and serving the customers. Greek salad with gyro meat is one of my favorite quick service meals in the area."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and it's very close to my neighborhood. Even though I've eaten at several other locations of Showmar's this one is my favorite. They are so nice and very attentive when you dine in. The food is excellent and very reasonably priced. The portion size is extremely generous and I always get two meals from one order. They also have your order ready for you when you get carry out."}
{"text":"Hmm.. can't really share others' enthusiasm..  Ordered the Chicken Pita today. Service was great, cashier very friendly and wait staff prompt.  The pita was average... the chicken had no real taste to it and they didn't put enough Tzatziki sauce on it, so really all it tasted like was pita and lettuce...  So, nothing wrong with the place but just not very memorable... will probably be back some time because some other items on the menu looked pretty good."}
{"text":"We really like this Showmars.  This has become our favorite weekday restaurant when we want to grab a good quick meal. The service is exceptional. They hire bright, clean cut students that will keep your beverage cup full and ensure you are 100% happy with your dining experience. Every meal we have had has been good.  I particularly like their fish, hamburgers and Gyros."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Good food, very fast service, dependable,  consistent.  The service is so good,  it's almost competitive among the servers."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I've been coming to this location for years and they always provide awesome food and fast service. I usually do to go orders and call ahead, but they always have it ready for me even if I'm calling a few minutes before I arrive. The employees are friendly and the location is close by. Only downside is parking around busy times, but that's common in south Charlotte."}
{"text":"The food was quite delicious and fresh. I don't see why any people would hate it. There's excellent service and the quality that they put in their food is consistent. Like one time, I ordered pita bread sandwich and man! It tasted delicious! The fries are not as salty. This place will satisfy your hunger for American food."}
{"text":"Showmar's has great food and it is fast! This location is a little small and gets packed around the dinner rush. Patio is used for overflow but I'm really surprised they haven't upgraded to a nearby larger location. The empty Blockbuster building would of been perfect. Anyhow back to the food, the entire menu is tasty and provides a good variety."}
{"text":"Cheap. and Nice place if you go to the restaurants , They also have these places in food-courts and the food is about the same. Decent"}
{"text":"I really like this Showmar's for lunch. I especially like the fish sandwich or the fish platter. The service is great - the wait staff come around often and they are always cheerful. This is one of those places on my list that I can always depend on for good food and good service."}
{"text":"Great place for a fast, casual meal at a great price.  I am always reluctant to go because I associate this place with mounds of fried food - but they have good salads too. On my last visit, I had a greek salad with grilled chicken and pita bread on the side. I really enjoyed it for what it is - a fast casual family oriented restaurant. The place is clean, the employees are helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"company seems to have no standards. food is inconsistent. service is mediocre/non-caring. overpriced for what you get. do they have a manager on duty? Ever? do they despong to consumer problems - no never."}
{"text":"I would choose 6 stars if possible. Hands down best service for this type of restaurant. The staff here completely goes out of their way to make sure you have a great experience. The food is great. I have been here at least 10 times in the past 3 years and am always pleased."}
{"text":"Just like most the the chain, which I am a big fan of, my first visit to my neighborhood Showmar's was a great one.  Recently moving into this 'hood, I was happy to see a Showmar's so close to my new apartment and took the opportunity of a long day at work as an excuse to blow off my \"diet\" and enjoy some fried shrimp.  Located at the Providence Commons shopping center at the corner of Providence and Ballantyne Commons Pkwy (on the Providence Rd side) parking was ample and well lit - but look out for all of the speed bumps (more like speed curbs), they are ridiculous.  I was probably slightly early for the dinner crowd, so my wait was only behind one family.  I quickly ordered the calabash shrimp platter with extra tartar sauce (they do charge extra for extra sauces, as most places do, but their tartar sauce is YUM), which comes with a good sized portion of fried shrimp, french fries, a few hush puppies (hello carby goodness) and cole slaw (their slaw is crunchy and creamy, with a slight sweetness, very good) and a giant sweet tea.  Showmar's has GREAT sweet tea - not syrupy sweet, just the right amount and they have the pellet-sized ice that I love.  I was in need of some sweets too and don't like baklava (I know, I don't know what is wrong with me - it's sweets and pastry, how can it be bad...?), so I purchased one of the white chocolate macadamia nut cookies that were on display.  The food was hot and fresh.  I quickly got my takeout and it survived the 5 minute trip back to my apartment still on the hot side of warm.  I was disappointed that neither ketchup or utensils were in my bag - they usually ask at the Park Cedar location and I forgot to tell them.  No big, I was at home which contains both ketchup and utensils.  The shrimp were standard calabash style shrimp - well breaded, decent sized, good flavor.  The tartar sauce is what makes the meal for me - delicious.  Fries were fat crinkle cuts, cole slaw wasn't pulverized like some places, but nice sized chunks of the veggies in a creamy sauce that coated everything well but didn't drown it.  Hushpuppies were good (I don't think I have ever had a bad hushpuppy?!).  The cookie was bleh.  Mushy, not very well flavored, seemed underdone, I was not a fan.  My order was ready quickly and was correct, food was delish as per usual (except the cookie) - love Showmar's and this location is a great one!"}
{"text":"About a month ago was my first time here and I absolutely loved it.  I got the grilled chicken salad and the chicken was cooked so perfectly !  The salad part was a spring mix, which was a nice surprise because most restaurants just use iceberg lettuce.   The service was also phenomenal! The servers knew the menu like the back of their hand and our food came out lighting fast.   Awesome !"}
{"text":"Their ad says everybody loves Showmars and I wholeheartedly agree.This location is down the road from my kids' school and, as we drive by daily, tempts us to stop for quick tasty meal. Showmars does serve good food fast as they claim but what they don't mention is what excellent customer service they offer. In my mind, it even rivals that of the gold standard in customer service, Chick-fil-A. The same holds true for their sanitary rating.  Their menu is diverse yet compact enough to display on a clearly read message board above their cashiers. It includes excellent burgers,  some of the best gyros around at any price, large fresh salads, fried seafood, marinated beef and chicken tip platters and much more.   Other bonuses include very affordable substantial kids meals at around 5 bucks and crushed ice fountain drinks that they faithfully keep topped off. On top of everything else, they even regularly mail out $2 and $4 off coupons. For me, they are easily earn a five star rating among restaurants in their category."}
{"text":"Best Showmars in Charlotte! Food is always great and the service is always better! Great for lunch of dinner!"}
{"text":"We had a to go order . Quick service great employees. Had kids chicken tender, fries , drink , cookie. Cheeseburger with Ketchup only , fries and Dr. pepper. My boys were happy they love Showmars"}
{"text":"My very first time here. I had one of their big salads. It was delicious, fresh, and amazing. The chicken was so good. Loved the taco shell the salad came in. I can't wait to try more of their menu. The customer service was over the top A+. Kudos to Shomars."}
{"text":"We ended up here randomly over the weekend!  We were in the Ballantyne area doing a bunch of shopping and hunger struck.  We originally looking for pizza, but then a chicken pita called my name!  This was my first ever visit to any Showmar's.  I didn't realize that it was an order at the counter place until we walked in- but it was exactly what I wanted, because I was STARVING!  We both ordered the grilled chicken pita.  There was a choice of white or wheat.  We both made it a combo.  The sandwich itself was around 6.99 and the combo added a few more dollars.  The side choices were plentiful but we both decided to get fries.  We sat down with our number and our food arrived in around 10 minutes.  The sandwiches were a good size and tasted super fresh!  Not greasy at all.  I usually like extra taziki but I forgot to ask for it and there was plenty on there, even for me!  Plenty of fries too...and I finished my plate!  I was tempted to try a milkshake, they looked good and I think were $3.  Free drink refills too!  I liked Showmar's for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here embarrassingly often. We always receive excellent service and consistently delicious food. We've never had a negative experience here. The staff looks well managed and happy to be at work. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but I have been to Showmar's several times and can't climb aboard the Love Train like so many locals.  It isn't unpleasant, but the ambience is meh, the food is meh, the price isn't a wallet-buster, but there are other places I can think of which are comparable in price and superior in taste.  Props, though, to the staff, which is very attentive. I honestly have no huge gripe with Showmar's, just a distinct lack of being wowed. Perhaps my minority view should be seen as just that; I don't get opera, either, and the fact that opera has been around for centuries would indicate it is my failing and not opera's."}
{"text":"Oh, Showmars...how I love you.  Your pita burgers, ranch dressing, sweet tea with the BEST. ICE. EVER., and excellent service make me miss you all the time.  Whenever I'm back in Charlotte, I make many trips to this casual and quick restaurant.  They make it really easy to take and order to go or eat in their dining room.    Head to Showmars and order anything, you won't be disappointed.  They do have a couple of specials every day."}
{"text":"Wow!  There was a man who opened the door for me as I entered the restaurant.  He greeted me and ushered me up to the register.  He even took my order and after the food arrived at my table, he came over to check on me!  It was like a personal concierge service.   Impressive.  I had the chef salad with chicken and warm wheat pita bread.  The salad was fresh and was served with a great presentation.  It's been forever since I popped in here. I just always thought of this as a place with very fast food.  What I experienced today changed my mind completely and I will be back. Even if I don't have personal concierge service, the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the space will call me back.   Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"So if you want a Gyro, here in the South, Showmars is the place to go. Its very good plain food. They have great Customer Service and most every single thing I have ordered in the last 10 years has been perfect. They have Fried Fish, and Calabash Shrimp, a pretty good Hamburger and the Gyro's that are pretty close to a Greek restaurants.  I have had the Chicken Santorini and the Veggie platter. Consistent quality is what you remember here. They give you a nice little side salad or Greek salad with your Gyro Platter. The only thing they could improve on is their French Fries, although the dogs love them I too would like to eat them but they just taste baked. Not really fried."}
{"text":"Had lunch at this location today and forgot to use the Showmars app. I contacted support and they were so quick to respond and credit my account (which unlocked a $10 credit). Great customer service!! See you soon!!"}
{"text":"My dad loves this place but to me, Wendy's has a better burger and that's not saying much.  The burger you could tell had been frozen and wasn't even warm when served.  The onion rings were inedible.  The salads my dad got were pretty good, considering.  I will avoid this place from now on for sure."}
{"text":"what happened showmars??? This location used to be one of the best, tonight...ugh. New menu....the sliced pork tenderloin is still season well but the quality of the pork was poor, extremely fatty. When the young female employee that comes back to check if everything is ok I addressed this to her. The response was \"wow, I'm sorry. I can see what you mean\" That was it....I suggested she inform t he manager, no one followed up. The greek salad is still very good and fresh but I can see the quality is slipping. Will not return for a while. Sorry, everybody doesn't love Showmars....and it shows"}
{"text":"I love show mars. I thought their seafood wouldn't be good because of the fast foodie vibe but no it's great. They also give you such large portions for the price. I will definitely be back. Also, service is super friendly."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and delicilous. The employees were very nice and attentive. I had the flounder plate and my babe had chicken avocado salad. It was soo much food, we couldnt eat it all. The restaurant was clean. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What can you say about Showmar's? Good burgers (I like the Super C), gyros, onion rings & ice cold Cheerwine! Yep, Cheerwine, a southern classic. You don't see that everyday in the fountain drinks!  When we visited this location on Friday night, the service was friendly and the food was served up fast. And it's affordable. My family of 4 got out of there for $25 bucks."}
{"text":"This restaurant is less than a mile from my home.  Tonight was our first visit.  We're from Georgia and this place reminded us of The Yeero Village in Roswell Georgia.  Finding this place really pleased us.   You order at the counter.  You're given a number to place on your table and the servers bring the meal to your table.  Just like Yeero Village.   We ordered Gyros, which were fantastic.  They were loaded with meat.    People at the next table ordered burgers and they looked mighty good.  We noticed numerous dishes that were enticing looking.   This place was pretty crowded, but there was no wait for a table.   This place is going to be a regular at least once a month night out.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to this location this week. Fantastic service from the order takers and I receive my order both times within five minutes. The employees checked on me while I ate over four times to make sure I was OK and I didn't need anything. Some of the best customer service I received at any restaurant. The food is delicious and they have a great selection. I would highly recommend you coming here if you need a quick good meal for a low price."}
{"text":"We frequently go to this Showmar's for lunch and have never, ever had a bad meal.  It is always fresh and piping hot and fast.  Their fish, gyros, fries, and onion rings are to die for and you can't go wrong ordering them.  The staff is very friendly and the Manager is always pitching in and checking on his customers.  We love this place.  I do have a suggestion-when wiping off tables they sometimes forget to wipe off the benches for the booths. The only thing I feel sad about is they do not serve Greek spinach pie (spanakopita) which we absolutely love."}
{"text":"This restaurant is consistently good!   I have eatten at several locations and they are all great.   From chili cheeseburgers, or pita burgers, to great fish and chip dishes, and the fresh salads -- you will not be disappointed.  The restaurant is clean and the employees very polite. Don't forget to try a milkshake or the southern sweet tea.  You will give this restaurant a thumbs up as well!"}
