{"text":"Delicious chips and salsa, amazing margarita, fantastic atmosphere. Totally coming back."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today. I had a breakfast burrito and my friend had enchiladas we both had a beer - absolutely excellent"}
{"text":"Our hostess Ari was incredibly sweet to the group as we had to wait a bit for a table to open up. Go on Tuesdays for unlimited tacos and tequila for only $24. It is well worth it. The drinks are strong and the tacos are delicious. You can only order steak or chicken tacos with the unlimited deal. I've been here twice and both times, the waiters were extremely attentive.. I love this place!"}
{"text":"From the chips and salsa to the tequila and mezcal offerings, Borracha is a winner in every respect of the word. The fish burritos and the street tacos are always delicious. But the best choice is the slow cooked pork carnitas. We first tasted it during Restaurant Week last summer, and it is hard not to order it on every time here."}
{"text":"Delicious blood orange margarita. Nachos were good, chicken and beef enchiladas were ok. Service was also just ok."}
{"text":"So my girls and I decided to do brunch and decided on borracha.. we had no idea it was going to be on a playoff weekend, but here we were... it was pretty busy when we got here, but Hayley was on top of it  and such a sweetheart. She was very attentive and made sure we were always good. It's a cute spot in GVR and if you're looking for somewhere to dine with a fun atmosphere, I'd recommend borracha!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been too! The food was just amazing! The salsa  is to die for!! The service was just perfect. If you're ever in Henderson and want some good Mexican food go there! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Trendy Mexican restaurant in GVR. The food was good but not great, but the drinks they serve are incredible. If you're not staying at the hotel, I'd avoid the large margarita! The staff was friendly and attentive... If you're looking for upscale Mexican, you could do worse."}
{"text":"Great house margaritas! Never any regrets trying this place out or making it a staple.  And ladies... come see Rob! He's here almost every night. Always super sweet, attentive and mucho sexy!!"}
{"text":"Wow! That's all I can say about this place. My group went to Borracha to celebrate my friends birthday & it was an incredible experience. Our server Star kept the drinks coming & made our experience so special. Definitely a night to remember!"}
{"text":"You can literally smell how good this spot is just walking by! I can always come by to get my Mexican fix. Quick and easy at the bar with Rob! He always serves us so prompt and has great hospitality. I'm not big on yelp but I had to give Rob a shoutout!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Borracha tonight and had a great experience! Happy hour all day is amazing and was given excellent service by the bartender Rob! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nick, our server, was attentive and AWESOME! Food was surprisingly good and the drinks surprising strong. The atmosphere for a Saturday night was just right."}
{"text":"I went there last night. The room was cool, the decor and ambiance was great. The service not so great. It was pretty busy, all the guests seemed to be having a good time. The food was ok- nothing super special or original.   The food came out quickly, it was hot and fresh looking. We had the slow roasted pork and garlic shrimp. I was watching the food runners do their thing- they are very good.. Great job there!  The service from our server however was not that great. She was very very nice however, I think she may have been overwhelmed.  Unfortunately for the restaurant they missed out on about $40 in beverage sales because our server was unable to return to our table for us to order more cocktails. It took quite awhile to get the check as well. I also don't understand the manager wearing a suite with sneakers?? Looks weird- if that is the look you really need to do it with chucks not skater shoes... But that is just my personal opinion ;) I'll go again, but I'll sit at the bar ;)"}
{"text":"Came here after enjoying the day at the GVR pool. Stephanie our bartender and the rest of the staff were great. The drinks and food were all delicious and are highly recommended. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Aubrei was AMAZING! It was our first time here and she made it an amazing experience. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place the food is amazing the people are friendly and nice. It's also a really clean and happy place. I usually order the chicken nachos man those this are the bomb best nachos i had in my life I will love to go again soon."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak tacos. They came out as chicken but they took care of it very quickly. The tacos were only ok. My husband had the fajitas and he said they were good, nothing fantastic. I guess I expected it to be more tasty for the price. Service was excellent. Atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere,  Fiesta!!!! CUTE PLATES AND SILVERWARE. Nice bartenders and the food is great! GVR doesn't disappoint.  They even have skeletons that hold up the limes and lemons xoxo bon appetit"}
{"text":"I got the carne asada tacos, and they were delish. My sister got the pork carnitas, and she said \"These are some of the best carnitas I've ever had.\" I also got the casa margarita, and I don't think they measured the alcohol, so I'm a little tipsy. But they put cinnamon sugar on the rim. Mmmmmmmm!! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great meal.. our waitress Hailey was friendly and the servers helping out were attentive.. delicious margaritas!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner since it's New Year's Eve and place was pretty relaxed. Didn't mind it wasn't too crowded yet because we were able to get a good booth that has the flat screen right in front of us. Got to watch some football too. Chips and salsa came complimentary. Salsa was ok. The servers and workers there were all very nice and attentive. Ordered the bean and cheese dip, cheese enchilada, and chicken quesadilla. Everything was good. Personally, I thought it could use more seasonings, but it was safe. Good atmosphere. Would try again."}
{"text":"Won't be back here again! This is the second time we've been here. The first time was when they had just opened, their service was terrible at best. We figured it was due to new staff and grand opening week.  We'll, we decided to give Borracha a second try, low and behold their service still stinks like a dead corpse that has been rotting in the desert sun! On this night the restaurant wasn't very busy and there were quiet a few open tables. It took our hostess a while before she sat us and when she did, she placed us right next to the server station. When asked if we could have a different table, we were that's not going to be possible.  So we sat down at the table without being handed a menu. I have to give the bus boy a 5 star rating due to his attentiveness. He was quick with the water, chips and salsa. So my girlfriend and I sat for the next 15 minutes sipping on our water and munching on the complimentary chips and salsa. Halfway through the chips and salsa we tried to get the attention of a server to no avail.  So we finished those chips and I walked up to a server and let her know what we thought about the service then left. Her response was classic...\"oh\" so needless to say we won't be back there again."}
{"text":"Love the drinks have a awesome time Rob the bartender was amazing definitely recommend the sangria will come again for sure  anytime I visit Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Came here to try some bomb food.. what did we get ? Bomb food and Diane! Diane was super helpful with suggesting what to order, we had a great time and had some great service ! I'd definitely come back again !"}
{"text":"I liked the food and the margarita and the best Flan I ever had and that says something,but others in my party did not like their overcooked chicken and returned it for fish but it was not much better. I liked the theme and if you have never been to Mission Valley in Henderson it is really a nice place to go out and have fun."}
{"text":"Margaritas & shrimp tacos were excellent! Server Ashley helped us pic and everything was great!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner @ borroca and Sky has looked after us really well. The blood orange margarita is great!"}
{"text":"Food, drinks, and service were amazing! Haley was more than helpful and constantly checked on us to make sure we were doing doing well, along with Johann. My girls and I had such a great time, we will make sure to come back!"}
{"text":"Best experience I have had in Las Vegas, Star gave the  most hospitable experience possible. Absolutely deserves 5 stars for Star."}
{"text":"The \"Heat of the Moment\" cocktail is great! It's sweet and spicy, and wonderful contrast of flavors. The pork carnitas are the best I've ever had, with a presentation I've never seen before. Loved them.  Service is good, atmosphere is fun, and a great place to watch your favorite game."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with friends. Service was good but all 3 dishes were gross!  Very pricey to have 0 flavor."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner.  Food was very good.  Salsa outstanding.  Manager was very friendly and answered any questions.  Service was okay.  Very loud in the restaurant to the point that you need to speak to your company very loudly to be able to have a conversation.  Felt a little rushed.  Suggestion.  Hostess should give you the menu when they seat you.  You should not have to wait for the server."}
{"text":"I'm only giving one star because there aren't any options for 0 Stars. I came the week the restaurant opened and the food was amazing as well as the drinks. The guacamole was to die for.  What the heck happened in less than six weeks??? The quacamole has completely changed. It doesn't say there are onions on the menu in the guacamole and there was so many onions in the guacamole the indigestion was almost immediate. The first time there were no onions in the guacamole and I get ill from onions, so I was thrilled to have it again, sadly it is not the same. I mentioned this to the waitress, who by the way was amazing, she brought another bowl of guacamole and it had even more onions in it. The chef said he made it special, and this time it was worse. Street tacos were subpar, both the chicken and carne asada were chewy and fatty. The margaritas weren't the same either from the first time we were there.  So what happened to myself and my mom? We both spent a day-and-a-half in the bathroom and we aren't sure if it was possible food poisoning.  WE WILL NOT BE BACK!"}
{"text":"I go here once a week for happy hour with friends and we love it! Steph is awesome and always treat us well.. we look forward to seeing her on Tuesday's every week!"}
{"text":"It started so great, Dylan was a great waiter, we loved the chips and salsa, the bean dip was good, Margarita was good. The empanadas, they were OK, a little dry and made with puff pastry, but everything else was good and the atmosphere was fun so who cares.   We had also ordered shrimp fajitas to share for our entrée. This is where things went south. The shrimp were tiny and few. It looked like the onions and peppers as well as the shrimp were steamed or boiled. There was no color to indicate that they'd been grilled or cooked at a high heat. And, there was no seasoning. I told my husband that the fajitas at Chili's were better than these, and didn't come with a $22 price tag. Unfortunately, these fajitas were a big fail and frankly, left a bad taste in our mouths regarding the restaurant and dining for the weekend, as it was the last thing we ate.   I tried to contact the restaurant directly, but the email address they showed on the website didn't work.  We loved the GVR, but have decided that we'll be back soon to stay there, we won't return to Borracha."}
{"text":"Skyy was our server and she knew exactly what to recommend for our first visit. She was attentive and friendly. Hubby had steak fajitas (he cleaned out his plate) and I had the shrimp tacos on jicama \"tortillas\". It was all delicious! The reverse happy hour was a great surprise. Not to mention, check in through Yelp and get a free margarita!!!   Great addition to GVR!"}
{"text":"Johann has amazing hair, was very helpful and the bartenders are cute (rob) ;) I got a cheese quesadilla from the reverse happy hour (9 PM-11 PM) and it was sensational. 10/10 recommended. Skyy was so welcoming and had very amazing personable service. Perfect place to come with friends or family."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas Metro. We have been searching for years for a good Mexican place.  We ordered the fondito, so yummy. Chicken fajitas were really good too. Ordered the bean and cheese, will skip that. Didn't care for the street tacos either. But overall, good quality. Friendly staff.  And if you are still reading this, please don't go here. We don't want to make it too crowded for us to have a table!  :)"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with amazing service! Our hostess's name from last night was Hanna and she was just darling. I would definitely recommend the carnitas and am probably going back for dinner tonight! Not only was the food wonderful, but the atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while watching the bowl games in the casino. My friends were looking for a good place to drink so we chose Borracha.   I'm happy we did!  Jesus really knew about his tequilas!  I never imagined a more fresh tasting margarita.   No pre-mix sour stuff like other places I've tried.     We only ate a few quick appetizers and the taquitos were fantastic!  Gotta order those if you go."}
{"text":"This was my first and last time going to this restaurant.  They have a Tuesday taco special advertised.  I'm mature enough to expect limitations, but the items available were embarrassing. The taco selection was limited to beef or chicken tacos.  They did not offer any sides (salsa, guacamole, pick de gallo, etc).  They charged extra for these items.  The tacos came wrapped in foil which caused the tortillas to become mushy and soggy.  The special included margaritas and tequila shots as well.  The server did not offer the margaritas blended or on the rocks.  The margaritas were not served in traditional glasses.  A couple of my companions noticed that some tables had traditional glasses.  This caused speculation that customers who come for the special do not receive the same treatment as those who don't.  The restaurant also seemed to be understaffed.  Drinks took more than 15 minutes to arrive.  The tacos got cold and mushier while we waited to order condiments.  I apologized to my guests for the entire experience."}
{"text":"I came in here for some tacos and tequila a while ago with friends and I was completely blown away after trying the guacamole! Literally the best I have ever had. We shared a pitcher of mango margarita and it is unforgettable to say the least!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. I will become a regular at this spot. & affordable too!!"}
{"text":"Great place and atmosphere. Our waitress Hailey was very good and attentive. Food was good and fast service."}
{"text":"Arrived as a party of four at 5:00 on Friday night.  We were told by one of the hostesses (not sure why there were four of them) that it would be 25 minutes or less. After about 20 minutes I checked back, and she said it would be shortly, and sure enough we were seated a few minutes later. Server didn't offer chips/salsa until we asked, so that was a bit of a letdown, but once we got them they were delicious.  We had kiddos in our party, and the kid's taco was miniscule.  So tiny that the rest of us were offering parts of our meal.  When our server came to check on us we all kind of laughed at how TINY the kids taco is, so she asked if we would like another one, and we accepted.  Was surprised to see we were charged for TWO kids meals when the check arrived, but when I questioned it she took it to the manager who took both charges off.  So..... Food is excellent and I'm sure they are still working out some kinks.  We will be back and I would recommend Borracha."}
{"text":"Very clean and excellent food! Awesome selection of drinks and very great service! Highly suggest to anyone!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday with unlimited tacos and tequila!? Amazing! Prompt, pleasant, professional service, a DJ, and a happy atmosphere. Our waitress Hayley was exceptional! Definitely will be trying here again when I'm back in the area!"}
{"text":"I was invited to try this new place with my friends to celebrate a birthday. I was very excited because I mean who doesn't love Mexican food?? Unfortunately, I left disappointed. The carne asada burrito I ordered was completely void of taste, rice and beans bland bland bland! Condiments were not available on the table so I wasn't able add any flavor.  Decided to give the tres leches cake a try, again, flavorless. Just a pile of soggy cake. When the bill came (split between five people) it was a little ridiculous. Definitely overpriced when compared to quality of the food.   Negatives - bland, flavorless, way over priced   Positives -The (house) margaritas were delicious and our server was polite and attentive.  Overall,  I wouldn't recommend this for dining maybe just for happy hour."}
{"text":"Everything comes with cheese unless asked. Limited vegan options. The ONLY good things here are the corn salad, chips and salsa, and margaritas. Vegetarian tacos and fajitas are no bueno.  Service is very good. Come for margaritas stay for chips and salsa. If you eat meat you will have a better experience"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Dylan was our server & he is the one reason we would come back again.   I ordered the carnitas & it was delicious it has a twist on it, you need to try it to figure it out.  My husband ordered my magi mahi fajita it came out dry but still tasty. He will not order that again.   Make sure to check in on Yelp to get as free margarita"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I definitely wouldn't be back. The service was AWFUL! Slow, slow, slow! I waited ten minutes for a bottled beer. I asked if they had Vegetable Fajitas and she said \"you mean like peppers and onions?\" No, I don't want to eat peppers and onions with a tortilla. I asked if they had squash and zucchini and she said no. So I opted for the Tostada Salad. Surprise surprise, it's not served on top of a tostada. There were wontons in the salad and it lacked flavor. We also ordered a side of the Mexican Corn which also lacked flavor. Typically Mexican Corn is served on the cop and this was seared off the cob. The table salsa tasted like a jar of tomatoes. Everything lacked flavor and the service was AWFUL. The ambiance is nice, however not worth ever coming back to."}
{"text":"Bigtime recommended; some of the best Mexican food in all of the Las Vegas valley. The Chile Relleno is to die for. I don't usually expect that much from restaurants in a casino (this one is inside Green Valley), but this one surprised me. For best bargain, try Happy Hour where they have $6 house margueritas and plate food for the same price."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my girls and was more than pleased with our service from Haley! Drinks and food were amazing, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is the greatest on Tuesday nights! Especially if you get HALEY as your server."}
{"text":"Fabulous atmosphere and delicious food. Free Margarita was yummy! Order appetizers and we are stuffed. Chips were warm and free and the salsa excellent."}
{"text":"First time here and really liked the food & service.  Nuff said.   Will be back for sure. Had the Carnitas & a guacamole starter.  Mmm"}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times before. On our visit today however I let a worker know, out of courtesy, that we forgot our service dog vest which indicates that my chihuahua is indeed a service dog. I am a chemo patient and can be forgetful so we opted for a vest ALONG WITH id.  She gets manager guy. I explain the situation and he proceeds to tell ME there is \"no such thing as a service dog vest\". Are u freaking kidding me?! Then he asks me about her training, do I know the laws about service dogs bc if she violates any law/rules we'll be asked to leave or move to patio, etc! Wtf.  We decided to eat on the \"pet friendly patio\" with my dog to avoid the hassle and the glares."}
{"text":"The margaritas were very good.  The chicken tortilla soup was very thick and not what I'm used to having - not your traditional tortilla soup.  It wasn't bad but I wouldn't order it again.  I heard the fajitas that others in the party ordered were tasty.  They don't have white cheese dip, it's a baked cheese, which didn't please my daughter, but it was good."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and our Bartender Rose was the best! The chicken taquitos were amazing!"}
{"text":"Make sure you see Edgar and Rob. They are  certain to make the best drinks. Always a fun time with friends. Great food and great drinks.  Happy anniversary Borracha!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and came for \"Day of the Dead\" the atmosphere was amazing they had live music and the hostess was very nice! She seated my party of 4 in a timely fashion. Our server Hailey was super sweet and told us the specials immediately which were $5 margaritas & tequila shots and $1 street tacos chicken or steak. We ordered a few apps guacamole and queso fundido which was amazing!!! Overall it was a great experience from the staff, ambience and food! I will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Haley was amazing especially with the bar being so busy and her not having a bar back. She was very friendly, efficient, professional had recommendations on the menu. Our drinks were amazing kept checking up on us. She is the best. We had a great time definitely will b back :)"}
{"text":"Delicious margaritas, cute decor, and the carnitas were fab! Try the rice pudding--surprisingly delish! Even their house chips & salsa was great. All in all, 5 outta 5 for me!"}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends for a birthday. I came a little bit later than some of my friends so I assume they were seated fairly quickly.   Service 5 stars- waitress was very very helpful and very accommodating. I think this was the highlight of the restaurant.  Food (1 Star)- my friends did the all you can eat tacos and margaritas. The only tacos that qualify for the all you can eat is the al pastor chicken and the beef tacos... so if you're VEGETARIAN you can't even get veggie tacos. You must order a la carte. I thought this was pretty lame since the bday girl was vegetarian and couldn't partake in the all you can drink because of this. In addition there was not very much meat in the tacos and the meat was very dry.   I would provably not come here for food again but probably would come here happy hour drinks."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the great food and friendly staff.  Stay for dessert, it's worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place.. the drinks are freaking amazing.. As a loyal customer my wife and friends appreciate your hard work.. Cindy, Jesus and Robert work hard"}
{"text":"The service was great!! The waiter was really nice.  The food was okay.  It didn't have much flavor."}
{"text":"So much hype  Yet this place was a huge letdown  Restaurant was empty , yet they took no one without a reservation . My sister really wanted to eat here so she went back without us to ask -politely I may add  And they rudely said no  -I can't say anything about the food.  But if your looking for service this isn't the place ... Make sure you make a reservation ,"}
{"text":"I know you can't upgrade a review, but I wish after a few five stars on Yelp, that some special restaurants such as Borracha, could get a huge gold star!    I have been to this restaurant since day one & watched it grow into an absolutely awesome restaurant.  It is because of the very special GM's Johan, Craig, especially Zach!  We love them & they should be in charge of places like Hanks as well!  Above & beyond describe these three.  Hanks... you can take a few pointers from them (a fine dining restaurant across from Borracha inside of the GVR casino.)  Borracha is like a neighborhood restaurant, that is located in a casino.  It is usually busy w/ both new & regular clientele, eating, drinking, playing video poker/keno or watching sports.  The food is fantastic, especially a few signature appetizers that I mention in my previous reviews.  A quick run-down... Cheese Quesadillas, Rock Shrimp Jicama Tacos, Beef Empanadas, Chicken Corn Tamales, Mahi Mahi Tacos & I just saw the Steak Salad which I will have to try next time!  They also have specials on Yelp, w/ the casino players card & daily specials.  Even more awesome!    Excellent service, friendships, & I can't say that many places, in alil over ONE year can do what they have.  The BEST staff in Henderson that I can honestly say can stand above many veteran casino restaurants .. Zach, Johan, Craig, Edgar, Steven, Jesus, Stephie, Francheca, Rodrigo, Rob, Cindy... you all keep doing what you're doing cause you are the BEST.    We appreciate you more than you know & remember you make our day.  Truly amazing & thank you!  Wish we could do more to show our appreciation or get you recognized."}
{"text":"Price: 2 stars Decor/energy: 4 stars Service: 3 stars Value: 2 stars Food presentation: 1 star Food flavor: 3 stars  We took \"advantage\" of their weekend lunch special on 8/19/17. $9.99 for 2 tacos + rice & beans. The food tasted Ok but the presentation was completely unappetizing. Their \"strip\" location pricing would indicate a moderate- higher end dining experience but we haven't found  this to be the case. My tacos came out on a blank plate with no garnish no lettuce leaf no pico di gallo, or any of the customary plating. The taco shells were stale prepackaged (think old El Paso or Ortega grocery store brands) shells. This was our third & last time dining here. With all the great authentic Mexican food in the area at reasonable prices, I don't expect this place to last. Too bad because it's a cute place with a fun vibe."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite Mexican restaurants! If you are around the area or not, you have to come check this place out! Green Valley Ranch is where it's located. Get on it people! Lol. When you come you have to ask for Alicia or try to have her as your server. YOU HAVE TO! She was very nice, respectable, and made sure we were priority! She was fast and always made sure we have water at all times. That might not seem like a big deal but we all know at some point how it is to be waiting for water. She had excellent customer service and this place is a must go."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic service was great and the free margarita was delicious. Will be back."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas! Located inside the Green Valley Ranch casino, it has a warm, attractive decor and friendly atmosphere. A free bowl of chips with a large bowl of delicious, chunky homemade salsa comes with the meal. The chicken fajitas are tender and delicious, as are the chicken enchiladas. Don't miss the Mexican street corn! Yum."}
{"text":"Came here in a friday night and it was so busy!Make a reservation because they fill up so quickly! Diane was awesome and took great care of us! She got us in in 20 minutes opposed to the 45 minutes quoted! She recommended the carnitas and the dynamite shrimp tacos, amazing! My favorite new restaurant!"}
{"text":"Chef Chuey prepared an amazing chicken bowl and our server was great! The salsa and guac was the bomb.com and I'd definitely come here again. Great Mexican place right next to the GVR cinemas, perfect for before or after a movie!"}
{"text":"The food is great; the service is not. We went in mid-afternoon on a Sunday and were one of the few groups in the restaurant. Still, we waited over ten minutes for two drinks. The bartender never even grabbed the drink ticket until our waitress went up and questioned him as to what was taking so long. Then he sniffed a shaker (to make sure it was clean??) sloshed some booze into a glass, and poured some pre-mixed margarita into a glass. For $15, we expected better than a margarita mix. We also waited so long for bean and cheese dip that the operations manager went back into the kitchen to see what was taking so long. Yes, it's a \"nice touch\" that the operations manager came over (as other reviewers have noted), but I would prefer good service that didn't require an apology. As I mentioned, the food was excellent, but not worth the excessive wait time and slow service."}
{"text":"1st time here; lovely atmosphere, great food. . .wonderful wait staff. What more could you ask for? Awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Didn't expect to have to wait 30 minutes on a Tuesday night at 5:20 pm. Hostess said reservations are recommended. So FYI.  Great service, plenty of runners, bussers. Our server was energetic and accommodating that we kept adding to our order.  Food? Some mediocre. Expected the chips to taste housemade. But the happy hour menu made us forget about the so-so chips.  Carne asada tacos and corn salad were the highlights. The sides of rice and beans that came with our chile relleno- mehhh. Rice tasted parboiled, and refried beans were thick. Chile relleno had a nice fluffy texture though. Skip- desserts. The churro ice cream sandwich tasted really greasy and were tricky to eat. We tried to cut the first bite since it was too big to bite, but made a mess. Rice pudding- lack luster, frosted flakes tasted like a generic brand. Tres leches cake- not good. We've had many of these elsewhere but this one was strange. Texture of cake was weird. And way too much leche sitting in the bowl.  Would probably give it another try but just skip desserts."}
{"text":"Everyone come to borracha! Make sure to ask for Star as your waitress because she's awesome as hell! The experience wouldn't have been the same without her!"}
{"text":"This was literally the worst experience I can remember having in quite sometime! It was my daughters birthday and 15 of us set out for an early dinner on a Friday night. I called early in the day to make a reservation with instructions to which no one returned the call. Another family member went online and made a reservation for (15) with instructions for a birthday and separate checks. The initial drink order took 25 minutes to make the table. The food an additional hour. When the bill came much to my surprise was all combined. This fiasco took an additional 45 minutes to resolve. If the food was good I would have rolled with the flow. But the small portions combined with the less than professional management threw me over the top. Everyone at the table had sufficient cash to leave and waiting for 15 minutes with me. I was picking up 3 tabs and required substantial change. The manager elected to cash out the 13 tickets without the customer standing there instead of mine. It was the most ridiculous process I have ever experienced! I was the only one remaining waiting for change and would not comply not to mention had a tremendous chip on his shoulder like I had done something to him. Keep in mind my entire party went home! Talk about killing an evening and what was supposed to be a memorable event. Although, I take that back we will all be talking about the terrible experience for years to come as we reminisce on the birthday milestone.   I would never recommend this establishment to anyone!   Should have gone to Pizza Rock. They are always accommodating."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken burrito. This was the most pathetic display of a CHICKEN burrito I've ever seen. If there were more than 3oz of chicken, I would be surprised. The burrito notes having rice, beans, sauce, and pineapple. There was NO pineapple, and it was loaded with onions. You don't put onions in an item without noting it on the menu. Extremely disappointed. Send the entire item back."}
{"text":"Oh my! I thought I had written a review of this place. My 2 stars come from the service we received but not the good. I was not impressed! Firstly you can not serve street tacos with out lime! Those were the dryest tacos I've ever had in my life! Not to mention this place is way over priced! Just not my cup of tea, maybe someone else's."}
{"text":"Very relaxing and chill atmosphere. We came here for a birthday party (party of 12) ,and they were very accommodating. They serve chips and salsa before you order. Check in for a free Margarita!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Outstanding meal.  Can't believe we hadn't been here before.  My better half had the salmon which she loved and I put down a full order of their highly suggested fish tacos.  Both dishes were superb.  While we weren't planning on dessert, the server suggested the tres leches.  Easily the best tres leches I've ever had.  Even though we missed Happy Hour, the prices will very reasonable.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  I had fish tacos and they were a delight.   This is fresh and healthy Mexican food, not the overladen cheesy stuff that leaves you feeling overburdened afterward.   It reminded me of Costa Rican food, fresh and light.   Atmosphere was lovely and I had a wonderfully smooth cocktail."}
{"text":"Came in Sunday after the Rugby Sevens tournament.  The salsa was delicious! I had the  Mexican street corn side and the bbq chicken cakes app, and they were both fantastic"}
{"text":"We heard mixed reviews about this place, but decided to get a group together and watch a Golden Knights game.  That was 2 nights ago.  It was so much fund and the food was so good we're going back again tonight.  Our server was outstanding and the little shrimp boom boom tacos were pricey, but well worth it (that's not what they're really called, but you'll know them when you see it on the menu).  The guac was great and the staff super friendly    Good crowd, good food, great service and they put up with me and my group.  Couldn't ask for me.   Thanks!"}
{"text":"I have attempted to enjoy here 3 times. The food can be decent when prepared correctly or as ordered.  There are definitely better options. It's a good place for drinks with chips and salsa. The only consistency is the mediocre at best service; it is usually very slow, inattentive, and orders are often incorrect. Having to send back half our orders made with chicken when requested vegetarian, trying for 15 min to flag down someone to request a spoon for the soup sitting in front of me, bartenders who out rightly ignore you and oddly rude hostesses are a few examples."}
{"text":"We are a loud party of 8 and came here for my moms birthday and Hayley was our server. She was amazing! We had so many different requests and she was on point, never making us wait for anything. And the food here is amazing! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The District and Green Valley Ranch have always been a favorite for me but I have definitely found a new fantastic dining spot!  The dynamite shrimp tacos were to die for and the Pablo Chacon cocktail was delicious and had me craving another. The service was on point and food presentation had us all wanting to sneak a bite from each other's plate. My friends and I all had an exceptional dining experience and will be sure to return very soon!"}
{"text":"Service was really slow & mediocre... we asked one of the waitresses that wasn't assisting our table for help & she seemed more than bothered. SO SORRY short brown haired lady that we asked you to do your job. Our waitress was cute but not attentive at all.... food was okay, could get better Mexican for cheaper just about anywhere... they give you a free margarita for checking in which is cool, but that was the only good thing about the place lol. I'll stick with Tacos & Beer, which I would highly recommend instead to anyone thinking of coming here.... hostesses were on their phones when we left. Didn't even thank us for coming in or any acknowledgement at all...... for the price you'd think they'd actually care about customer service..."}
{"text":"Ate here last night night for the first and last time unfortunately. Service: fantastic - I wish I had a restaurant so I could say please come here instead. Timeliness: food was out quick Drinks: I had a margarita that had too much mix and not enough alcohol- i am not a drinker so when i say I can't taste the alcohol it's legit Food: Carne Asada traditional tacos: they were way too salty, the meat was overcooked like it had been sitting under a heater for a while.  The black beans had absolutely no taste and were undercooked, soupy and bland. The salsa seems as though it was out of a can or container.   I don't go out to eat food that I could have possibly made... I go out to eat go food and taste culinary skills of those better at it than I.  Borracha- change your recipes or change your cook please - I want to like you"}
{"text":"Haley is our server and she was amazing! Food and drinks were reasonable & yummy! Definitely will return again."}
{"text":"Came into Borracha today for $10 bottomless margaritas and while everything about it was pretty average, Star was not average. Our server, who's name is Star btw, deserves a lot of stars for her service. Quick, attentive, and on top of everything we needed/wanted. Come here and ask for Star. You won't be disappointed with her."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on taco Tuesday. If you like Jose, house margaritas and chicken or steak street tacos, then this is the deal for you. Tuesday for $24 it's all you can eat and drink (in a 2 hour period).  We opted to order off the menu. I got the roasted pork carnitas and wow was that delicious. The pork was slow roasted for 5 hours making it oh so tender.  And the tomatillo sauce Was good enough to eat as a soup. It was citrusy and bright with almost a cinnamon finish. My drink the Obe-Juan was only ok and the service was less than stellar hence the 4 star review instead of 5. My friend also completely enjoyed her steak tacos as well, but reported that my carnitas were fat better. Check this place out, but know it is very loud and very hard to have a conversation due to the music and noise from other diners."}
{"text":"Will I be back to this place? absofreakinglutely! Let me start by saying that I'm a stickler on restaurant decor and this place has some amazing art work on the walls, their plates have drawings on them of Dia De los Muertos which I'm obsessed with. The staff is super friendly and helpful. Let me give kudos to their Manager Johann this guy was everywhere, team work to the fullest. I highly recommend their traditional tacos I had their Carne asada which comes with rice and beans, the way they marinate their meat is so delicious. After dinner we had their Tres Leches (I swear they sprinkle crack) because you just want more. Make sure to have a cappuccino with this desert it will give it an extra little love to your taste buds."}
{"text":"Simply put  YUMMM Wish they offered patio dining"}
{"text":"Received a flyer and email re: grand opening via my VIP host at Green Valley Ranch.  Rather shocked by the tasteless demeanor of service, most especially for Green Valley Ranch.  After a scowl more worthy of a disgruntled airline concierge, (at least in which case, appropo for the general norm), the hostess informed us that no, there was no room for two of us, as it was an invitation only event from 7-10pm.  Congratulations, SNORRacha, this is the first time in Las Vegas I've experienced dodgy nightclub style service in what I assumed was an eatery.  Pissing off locals, especially the kind whom regularly support GVR:  not the best foot to start on.  I will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"What a treat. Fresh delicious food.  The crab ceviche was incredible. And my wife's fajitas were perfect. Even the kids quesadilla was outstanding.  And a great happy hour and for nights without kids Tuesday tacos and tequila all you can eat and drink."}
{"text":"Excellent spot to go watch sports.  They hooked us up with tequila shots each time the golden knights scored a goal.  The only thing that sucked was trying to flag our waitress down to pick up or order in the beginning but once we was able put a face to the name the host gave us, we was able to flag him down each time. The food was great n happy hours was excellent. Great food n a blast to hang out at!"}
{"text":"Tuesday night all you can eat tacos, tequila and margaritas for $24 a person is a great deal. You can get chicken or steak Street tacos. Ask your server for some of the other salsa (not chip salsa) great flavor and a bit of a kick makes the tacos perfect. It does get busy and crowded so is I suggest making reservations. Staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Meh. In full disclosure, I don't love Mexican food unless it's truly authentic. The ambience was great, and the servers were very attentive and helpful (We had James). They were very tolerant of our young infant, and served us salsa and nachos immediately. (Yum). We got a free margarita by checking in on Yelp (Yeah!). However, the food was underwhelming and oversalted. I don't need to go back."}
{"text":"Service was great. The ops manager dropped by our table to check on us which is always a nice touch.    Menu was full of fresh options. I got a delicious brown rice bowl and their corn salad. It was happy hour and the prices + happy hour options were fantastic.   Great atmosphere with A+ service."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. Food and margritas were great. Our waitress Hailey was outstanding. Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"Excellent guacamole, salsa and carnita tacos. Fantastic server who really did a nice job at the end of a long day. We also enjoyed the chicken tostadas, light small tortillas that were closer to a wonton than a traditional corn tortilla they were delicious. We had a great time. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Rob is the BEST bartender ever! Very attentive and makes great drinks! Make sure you ask for Rob at the bar!"}
{"text":"I'm pleased to upgrade their star rating for my review.  I experienced a great improvement all around.  Here's the scoop:  The bean and cheese dip the first time around was a bland appetizer.  Now they added cheese sauce with an Asado/Jack cheese blend.  The beans had a creamier texture which made this a wonderful starter.    My friend and I shared the Grilled Mahi Mahi Tacos as well as the BBQ chicken Tamale Cakes.  The grilled fish tacos were refreshing and full of flavor.  It was a decent size piece of fish inside which made them filling.    Now if you want Mexican food, don't get the Tamale Cakes.  But for a taste of southern food, they are great.  The cakes are like packed cornbread topped with chopped chicken, red onion and poblano sauce.  Their BBQ sauce covers all of the chicken with a wonderful flavor.  I didn't expect it but I would recommend it.    We received great service for the evening.  I'm thankful for the improvement on food."}
{"text":"I don't exactly know why this place has all the good reviews but I'm assuming it's for happy hour and margaritas because the food is sub-par and I personally didn't enjoy anything we ate here. I'm a huge foodie and I love Mexican food but this place didn't cut it. I get that it's definitely more Mexican-American as opposed to authentic Mexican food but it was just okay. Nothing special. My girls and I came in because we wanted to try this place for the first time. We got margaritas, the nachos, chicken tacos, and chicken salad. To be honest, chipotle chicken tastes better. The chicken was dry and it didn't have any taste whatsoever. The nachos honestly were a huge disappointment. The queso didn't taste fresh and it was somewhat grainy. The tacos were dry and definitely not flavorful at all. The best thing about the place were the free chips and salsa and the margaritas. But overall, the food is just blah. I'd still prefer to stick to Eldorado cantina by sapphire strip club. Their food is amazing and authentic."}
{"text":"Came here on my birthday last month! It's located inside the green valley ranch. It was one of the best birthday dinners I've had in years.  Made a reservation through yelp (which is amazing) and arrived early. We were sat 15 mins before our reservation time. They were very nice and pleasant, and didn't know it was my birthday yet.  We ordered the bean dip as an appetizer, I got steak tacos and my bf got a salmon bowl.  The food was great! Very high quality, with lots of flavor. I also got a blood orange margarita, which was HUGE and so tasty. I could barely finish it was so big!!!  Definitely will be returning, highly recommend for good high quality Mexican food with a pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Salsa was great although we had to ask 2 times for chips and salsa, correct me if I'm wrong but isn't that like supposed to be served like water in a Mexican restaurant? It came AFTER our meal order - so much for tradition. Margarita  was great - made by Steven. Lauren was our server, she was sweet. Steven at the bar was great as well. Had a total of 4 margaritas 2/4 glasses were broke cut my lip on one....lesson learned I won't be back and I definitely don't recommend this place. The Mexican street corn? What a waste!  over all. Go to Taco Bell and hit up smiths for a margarita mix you will have a better dinner! I have to say that they did not charge us for the margarita that I cut my lip on - They ultimately did take care of the issues I don't feel ripped but will likely not be back. I give them 2 stars because I don't feel ripped otherwise it would be one. Sorry folks! PS - happy hour signs were almost hidden so when you go in ask about it, apparently it's the restaurants best kept secret or something!"}
{"text":"Awesome chips and salsa, house margaritas. Salad had delicious dressing and chicken tacos excellent. Great value!!!"}
{"text":"A beautiful and fun place. Truly cheerful and chic atmosphere.  Very tasty and not expensive cocktails.  I like to come here with my friends and have fun."}
{"text":"My wife and I play at GVR and we have wanted to try out this restaurant for sometime (we both love Mexican food). Unfortunately, we were deeply disappointed. The decor, service and ambience were all excellent. However, the food was tasteless. My wife ordered the chicken fajitas and I ordered the enchilada combination platter. My wife took one bite of her fajita and pushed her plate away. I ate half of one of the enchiladas and tried a little of the rice and beans. We thought that the food was very bland (like you would expect to find at a hospital). The very kind waitress was very concerned because we didn't eat our meals. We left the restaurant and stopped at Faustos Mexican restaurant for some take out on the way home."}
{"text":"Great ambiance with circular bar in the middle.  Ordered traditional carne asada tacos with cheese, lettuce, and creamy sause.  The creamy sauce cut the heat from the taco and balanced out the traditional flavors.  The chicken fajitas came fast and fresh.  The condiments included pico de Gallo, cheese,and  sour cream!  The service was fast and friendly.   I enjoyed my meal and service was top notch!"}
{"text":"Hostess staff was rude and arrogant.  Restaurant was less than 1/2 full but would only seat reservations (for after happy hour).  Never got a chance to try the food, but after the way we were treated at hostess stand, will not go back."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing. We are locals in Henderson and appreciate authentic cuisine. This is unlike any other Mexican restaurant we have been to. Our server Dylan provided us with the 5 star experience. We will certainly be coming back!"}
{"text":"A good Mexican food place. The decor is cool - with the Day of the Dead art on the walls & even the plates. The food is good - chicken fajitas are tasty - the guacamole is good & fresh - the street corn is good too. Loved the free margarita with Yelp check in!"}
{"text":"Loved the vibe here! GVR needed a place like this. Will definitely be coming back for happy hour and taco Tuesday with friends. Our food was delicious and came out hot! Also had a lovely server, Hayley. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant. The Asada Skewers were incredible! (Pretty sure I just found my favorite appetizer). Great portion size on the burrito I ordered. Definitely will be my go to spot when visiting Green Valley Ranch.  My girlfriend ordered the Passion Fruit Margarita and I have to say it was probably the best flavored Margarita I have ever tried"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice and the food was great. There were a few bumps in road with service but overall the waitress and hostess were very nice. The General Manager very promptly addressed our concerns and was very cordial. We are looking forward to our next visit, the food was awesome."}
{"text":"The food was great! Service was ok. I'm definitely not use to sitting at the bar with an empty glass and being ignored by the bartender. I mean, that's your direct station. Other than being forgotten for a while, we enjoyed ourselves. Plus when you check in you get a free margarita, just not the Cadillac.   Guacamole, of course, was our immediate order! It's hard to find bad guacamole, but since I've come across a couple... I'll have to say that this isn't one of them!  Taquitos also come with guacamole and salsa.   Skirt steak was my favorite! Cooked to perfection with chimmichuri sauce on the side!!!  I will have to make my way back for taco Tuesday!!!"}
{"text":"Hostess was very rude!! Mid sentence she walks away while I was speaking to her. Never ate here we just left. If their food is anything like their service, no thanks."}
{"text":"We got here @9:10pm, ordered our nachos around 9:15, and didn't receive them till 9:42, in which our server told us not to touch the plate because it was extremely hot!   Judging by the liquid cheese at the bottom of the plate coagulating, creme Fresca that was drizzled on there drying, the hard-dry chicken cubes, and the plate being warm, we could tell it had been sitting on the line a while. Which for being a newer restaurant, either the expediter or chef should've either A asked why it was still sitting there in the window and had someone run it or B at this point remade the nachos and had them comped for making guests wait 30 min for a dish that is considered an appetizer.  Sad part is I saw at least 2 front of the house mangers walking around, that not only noticed that we never had more than the complementary chips and salsa sitting in front of us for 30 minutes. Yet not one stopped to ask what we were waiting on, our own server never even asked us how our nachos were. And when she came back to grab it and asked if we wanted to take it home we said no and she didn't ask if we liked them considering more than half were still on there! We even mentioned that we were done as she walked off and never brought us our check!   So what was supposed to be a quick appetizer turned into an hour long ordeal in which our friends that were sitting next to us ate a full course meal and we're done before us and ordered after us!"}
{"text":"So I see this place has gotten mixed reviews but from me it gets the double thumbs up.   I've been twice and both times the food was so good. I really enjoyed the happy hour specials & this past time I got the appetizer sampler fantastic! I'll definitely be down to go again."}
{"text":"My bf and I came the other night to watch the Knights playoff game. We are both vegan and it is hard to find a bar atmosphere that has food we can eat aside from fries. Stations has added new vegan options to some of their restaurants and we were excited to try some. Boraccha did not disappoint. We had the Tofu Fajitas and Chili Relleno. The atmosphere was very fun and they gave out free tequila shots for every Knights goal. We will definitely be going back to try the rest of the vegan menu!"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite Mexican restaurant in Henderson. Staff is super friendly, service was on point, we enjoyed the Friday/Saturday night happy hour. Had chicken nachos, chicken tacos, carne asada tacos, and house margaritas! Manager was kind enough to even throw in two extra margaritas after we checked in on yelp! Great atmosphere, awesome music! We will definitely be back again! Great experience overall :)"}
{"text":"Too pricey, not enough variation on the food and way too noisy. I'm not sure I can recommend it."}
{"text":"Come to Borracha all the time to visit rob. He is very knowledgeable and gives incredible service everytime we are here. A must visit place. Margaritas are great and great happy hour!"}
{"text":"Adrienne was the best server I've had in a long time! Food and service was great. We were seated promptly (with reservation). Johann was very nice as well. We had a great time and will definitely be back!!!! I LOVED the atmosphere and service. Will definitely request Adrienne again. She was am amazing server. Way to put customer first Borracha..  The only gripe I have is that Libre had flavored margaritas"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant in Henderson!!! Located inside green valley ranch casino. The restaurant is specious and very nicely decorated in warm tones. We came around 8pm and were seated right away.  Our server greeted us immediately and brought warm chips and salsa which were delicious. We ordered the sampler appetizer plate, pork tacos, carne Asada burrito, and chicken brown rice bowl.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  Drinks were also really good! I checked in on yelp and got a free house margarita!!! Our server and the bus boy were so friendly and nice and actually had conversations with us.  Everything is also very reasonably priced for a casino restaurant.  We had such a great experience and evening here.  Will be back to try the happy hour."}
{"text":"One of my FAVORITE Mexican restaurants in Henderson! Love the fresh guacamole! It's a MUST try!!"}
{"text":"This has become a weekend ritual. Great food and great drink. Had the steak fajitas this time but the carnitas are just as good. Thanks Rob, always great service at the bar."}
{"text":"HOLY HAPPY HOUR!!!!!! We went for Taco Tuesday and couldn't be happier about our decision! I ordered off of the happy hour menu and everything was delish! The corn salad was my favorite! My boyfriend did the unlimited tacos and margaritas and loved it all! Definitely try this spot!"}
{"text":"Borracha is a great restaurant ran by hard working people. The service was incredible and the food was amazing! Everything was very clean also."}
{"text":"Where do I begin!  The chips were warm and salted just enough. I'm from Texas and we are very picky about our salsa and it is fantastic. I had the sampler and it was just the right amount of food. The margaritas have a serious kick to them. Perfect. We will be back."}
{"text":"Very good!  Kids menu was small, but can't beat the price ($5 for kids menu).  Husband got the carnitas, and was raving about the flavor.  I ordered the chicken tamale cake appetizer as my meal, and it was very good!    I also checked in to Yelp and received a free margarita.  The margarita was tasty, and served in a generously sized glass.   Parking was easy, and service was good (especially on a Saturday night!)."}
{"text":"Excellent food we went for happy hour. They have a great happy hour menu appetizers and drinks each $6.00. Edgar the bartender makes a wicked margarita"}
{"text":"This place is Amazing, The Drinks and Food are to Die, for me and my wife Love this Place, the people that work there are exactly what you should expect when enjoying Happy Hour and that's being Happy to serve you, not a very large facility, but makes up for with Class, I'm giving them 5 stars in my Book."}
{"text":"What a great venue!! Ambience, food, music and staff were so point. Dynamite shrimp tacos are my favorite and the blood orange margarita was good af! Dylan the server was awesome! And the manager was great and he made sure all good and drinks were up to par. I just became a regular. ?"}
{"text":"Total letdown. The salsa was generic. Asked for something spicier and not sure what they brought out but it was not a salsa. The food was more american than Mexican. Not impressed at all. Won't be going back again. One star is too much for this review."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Service was good. I was in a rush and let the staff know so they brought my meal out in timely manner. The only reason not 5stars was because I didnt get to try a variety of items on the menu or margaritas. I look forward to visiting my new Mexican spot"}
{"text":"I first tried Libre over in Red Rock Casino.  I love it for all of the same reasons I love this place.  Great food, really pretty restaurant, unlimited tacos and tequila, and this one just happens to be right down the street from me!!!  Score!  The only problem I have encountered is with how crowded this place gets but that is to be expected so unfortunately it is something that I will gladly have to try and work around to come here."}
{"text":"Went to Borracha to watch a Golden Knights game! They had great specials for the game -- free beer with VGK gear, free shot for every VGK goal. And half priced apps! Food was good. Great environment. We had a comfy booth in front of several TVs. Great option if you want more of a low key game experience versus tackling the crowds at T-Mobile etc. Will definitely be back for a meal on a non-game night too!"}
{"text":"Love coming here on my days off. Food is amazing! My boyfriend usually orders the chicken brown rice bowl which has plenty of a portion size for one person and packed with flavor! I love the dynamite shrimp tacos with the Mexican street corn on the side. The two together taste so good. Ambience is amazing always, nice lighting and TVs in every direction. Love their playlist playing too. Service is phenomenal across the board, from the bussers to the runners, servers and bartenders. Management is on point as well. They came over to check out our table and others as well to make sure everything was going smooth! Love Borracha! Thank you for always giving my friends and I an amazing experience."}
{"text":"Very fresh food,the healthiest and most flavorful i have had in Vegas.  Service was excellent too, very nice people that couldn't do enough for us!  Get dessert!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food! The salsa alone is worth the visit! The atmosphere is more sports bar than Mexican cantina, but it's not an issue in enjoying the food. I had chicken enchiladas, which were delicious. I also ordered the black beans (a little over cooked, but good flavor). Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"This was my 1st time and our bartender, Rob took care of us and had great recommendations; will definitely be back!! Great food!!!"}
{"text":"I tried the appetizer sampler and every item it came with was amazing ! They also have amazing carnitas!!"}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour! Monday thru Friday 4-6 then reverse happy hour on Friday and Saturday 9-11 apps and drinks $6 incredible deal. Must try pork carnitas and crispy dynamite tacos as they are both amazing. Also by far the best margaritas around!"}
{"text":"Service was great. They honored my free margarita no problem. Waiter was very cool and attentive. Good place to watch the games and food is VERY good!"}
{"text":"Great place! Been here twice already and the food and service has been spot on! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here.  Shout out to the GM for taking good care of us.  They start you off with a generous serving of chips and salsa.  Chips are just right, crunchy and light. Addicting so take your time!  Shrimp ceviche was great and paired with plantain chips.  A nice sweet contrast.  Steak fajitas cooked with onions, red and green bell peppers. Neatly displayed sides of pico, sour cream, and cheese.  I really loved the tongs provided to assist in assembling the fajitas. Finished every bite.    Service was excellent, didn't skip a beat."}
{"text":"What a difference a week makes.  After the bad experience trying to eat here last week I wasn't planning on coming back. Fortunately  the folks running the show at Borracha reached out to me regarding my experience and wanted to make things right.  My wife and I went back tonight at their request and they took great care of us.  The service was very good, especially considering they just recently opened.  The hosts were very polite, friendly, and accommodating, even asking our seating preference of a booth or table. They sat us right away and our server Skyy made it over to our table to take our drink without delay.  She was very helpful in explaining the menu and offering suggestions on apps, sides, and entrees. Through the whole meal Skyy took great care of us and was very friendly.  The manager made sure to check in on us as well to ensure we were being well taken care of.  The chips and salsa were good. I especially liked that the chip basket and salsa bowl was large enough so you didn't have to ask for refills.  We ordered guacamole to go along with the chips which was a good addition. The guacamole wasn't overly doctored with ingredients so the avocado was the star, just how we like it.  After seeing, hearing, and more importantly smelling the fajitas go by the table I couldn't resist.  I went with the chicken and added the Mexican street corn that our server recommended.  My wife went with the beef enchiladas with rice and beans.  I really enjoyed the fajitas. They came out hot and sizzling with very juicy chicken and carmelised peppers and onions.  The presentation was very clean with an everything's included  wood plank that neatly held the skillet, tortillas, and all the trimmings (Pico, sour cream, and cheese). The street corn was full of traditional flavor but comes off the cob which makes it easy to eat.  My wife liked her meal so I'll have to try the enchiladas at our next visit.  We ended the meal with the tres leches cake which we shared. After all the chips, guac, and salsa the cake came out the perfect size for sharing between two people. We both enjoyed it and would definitely order it again.  We even got some of the street tacos to go at the last minute which they turned around very quickly.  They had great to go packaging which kept everything fresh and hot.  Overall we really enjoyed the experience and are thankful we gave it another shot."}
{"text":"What a great happy hour! Everyone on the wait staff is friendly and very attentive to your every need. Guacamole is fresh, margaritas are delicious, and the environment is upbeat and fun.  This is a fantastic place for a group outing!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Chips n Salsa are great and always fresh. Service is awesome.They never let a drink go empty"}
{"text":"I felt compelled to write about my dinner at Borracha.  After reading all the reviews on Yelp, I went there last night with high expectations.  I love Mexican food. Our server was very nice.  First they give you a big bowl of salsa and chips.  I received a free Margarita with my check in with Yelp.  All of this was cool so far.  Then the disappointment...the guacamole didn't have much taste to it.  My date had the steak fajitas and it was chewy.  I ordered the beef enchiladas and it was lukewarm and there was hardly any sauce to go with it. The bill was over $60 and for that price, I expected more.  Needless to say, I won't be back and that's a shame because I enjoy going to Green Valley Casino."}
{"text":"We were super impressed with Borracha. The salsa is amazing and so were the steak fajitas we shared. We had been wanting to come here for awhile and I'm so glad we finally made it! We got free margaritas for checking in on yelp, who can say no to that!!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to eat the food is amazing but anytime me my mother and father come here the service at the bar is horrible we feel so uncomfortable ordering another drink because all we get is glares from the bartenders. I don't usually complain but when someone makes me this uncomfortable to order something like I'm a burden it's not right this is their job to serve customers. Our bill is usually over 100 but the service from the bartenders is horrible they all have attitudes we are to the point where even though the food is great we don't want to come back because of the service very disappointing."}
{"text":"Amazing Food!!!! The staff was very friendly and new their menu inside and out(food, drinks and wine)!!! They made our evening the best! We ended our night on a beautiful note and we will definitely be returning and telling everybody about this place!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and sat at the bar, rob the bartender is amazing! Even though it was busy he gave us Great service, amazing food and delicious margaritas.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We made reservations for NYE for 7:30pm. Upon arriving, we were asked to wait for our table and were seated at about 7:45. My husband and I go here quite often and love it, so we were excited to bring our friends who hadn't eaten here before. While walking us to our table, the hostess rudely said \"we need this table back by 8:45, just so you know.\" So by the time we were seated we would have only 1 hour to enjoy our New Years Eve celebratory dinner...great! It just doesn't seem to make much sense to me that (even on NYE) they would book reservations for 1 hour apart. This is something that should have been disclosed on the phone while making or confirming the reservation prior to coming in. Our server was great - friendly and knowledgeable. He recommended great drinks, and answered our questions about the menu. The food was good also. While we were finishing our dinner, the hostess approached the table and said \"I just wanted to let you know that it's 8:45 and we will be needing this table back.\" We we're STILL eating our dinner and hadn't even ordered dessert. Then she returned to the hostess stand and started talking to her coworkers and they were all looking over at our table. The bussers were coming over and removing things from the table that we were still drinking (water glasses, chips, etc.) Unfortunately, because of how we were treated by the hostess, our dinner experience was disappointing. We felt unwelcome, rushed and uncomfortable from the second she sat us at our table. Next time we are looking for a place to entertain friends, Borracha will not be on our list!"}
{"text":"Great place! Fantastic margaritas, the house salsa is amazing, the interior is some of the best local artwork I've seen and is worth the trip just to have a look. The restaurant was full so I sat at the bar. I'd had a bad night on the tables and The hostess gave me a bit of attitude so I was a bit of a jerk to say the least and I wasn't looking forward to the bar as a consequence. I had this amazing bar tender (I think her name was rose) who took the time to explain the menu to me and answered all of my stupid questions  and bad attitude with a smile. She poured me a margarita and I started to feel better. After all her advice, I had the fajitas, my Mexican \"go-to\". -they were terrible. A simple dish but easy to mess up. The chicken was well done, dry probably because the chicken was huge strips of white breast meat. There wasn't even enough condiments (cheese, sour cream etc) to go with the fajitas. I think $18 for fajitas is a bit rich for the portion. #stillhungry I only gave em 3 stars for the service."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday night. It was a fairly busy evening, but we were seated promptly. We had some free chips and salsa and ordered the corn salad to start. The salad was refreshing and delicious. We weren't sure what entree to order because there were many good choices. Our server recommended the carne asada street tacos and we were not disappointed! The meat was very tender and flavorful. We enjoyed it with a side of guacamole and a delicious mango margarita as well. The food and drinks were amazing and our server, Ryan, was very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. We had a great time and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was just awesome! Upon getting seated, we looked through Yelp and saw they offer free margaritas for checking in. The chips and salsa were sufficient enough for 5+ people but the salsa was so fresh, I'm pretty sure the two of us ate about 85% of what was brought to us.  We ordered the chile relleno to share. It was a huge portion -- sharing was a good idea. Again, everything was so fresh! The cheese, the pepper, the rice & beans (which also had a great spice to them)! Throughout our entire dinner, the staff was so attentive, multiple people stopping by to make sure we were well and taken care of.  We had the cinnamon churro sandwich for dessert -- omg! Served with vanilla gelato and a decadent chocolate syrup.  Overall, I am so satisfied and I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"VERY POOR!  Almost no chicken, cut until in chunks. Practically no garnishes.  A drop of sour cream!!  Service and food are poor here. Particularly if you sit at the bar. The staff just seems to wander around and it takes a large amount of time just to place an order.  Food came out warm and not really prepared well. Fajitas had very small tortilla shells, and only three of them, making it difficult to eat. Then you have to get their attention again to get a couple more. Why not just serve 4 or 5 and decent size ones?  Very disappointed for the prices charged."}
{"text":"The Tuesday deal is awesome! $25 all you can drink margaritas and tacos. Haley was our server and was fabulous. Great experience for a birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and delicious margaritas. I had the fish tacos and the Cadillac margarita and it made for an excellent lunch. The staff was friendly and made sure our drinks never got empty"}
{"text":"Great place to have in the neighborhood. I've never had a bad meal here. We came here yesterday for the Tuesday tacos and tequila deal (which is great)but some of us ordered off the menu instead. The blood orange margaritas are my favorite. Our party also enjoyed the beef empanadas (pictured), guacamole, and fajitas. I've been here several times and will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Dope spot, live DJ on taco Tuesday!  All you can eat tacos and drinks!!! Sweetest server Hailey.  Thanks Borracha"}
{"text":"Went with a party of 5 plus a 9 year old on a Saturday night.  It's really loud  with a cool vibe.  It's was super busy, wait staff was good but they were running!  I had the chili Relleno, it was good, however it was deep fried with hard shell, I prefer a more traditional Chili Relleno.  The salsa is awesome.  Everyone enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"My friend and I were really excited to check this place out , with all the hype and it being advertised everywhere we thought we would give it a try .  We sat at the bar due to having a long wait time to sit at a table , even though there were many open tables . We had a male bartender great us about 3 mins after we sat , gave us only one menu , he then took our drink order we order the Pinche pina and Alejandro something . After about 10 mins we finally got them and yes they both looked  nice but they tasted like water !! For the price of the drinks you think you would get something worth the money ! Something that caught our eye is the bartenders nails !!! They were so dirty you would have thought he was gardening before work !! They were so dirty you could see the black dirt in them . We finally ordered off the boring menu , you'd think they would have more options . Food was bland , barely had taste . The street tacos were OK. The taquitos had no taste .The guac could be way better . Everything was missing something to it . Maybe we just went in on the wrong day but I can honestly I give this place 2 stars just for the DECOR , the  dishes were beautiful  they fit perfectly with the restaurant and the decorations.  Other then that I would never come back ."}
{"text":"Wanted to finally try this place out so I brought my sister for her b-day. The food is great and the service was top notch. Dylan took great care of us. The ladies at the front greeted us nicely and everyone seems to be enjoying the atmosphere. Great place."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. Good vibes, clean, and great Tequila! A lot of TV's (which was good since football was on). Not ideal for kids, but a good place to come for drinks and food. It's not a large restaurant but I don't imagine it ever getting packed to the point of max occupancy. Prices are a little steep for what you get.  The beans I got tasted horrible but the burrito, fajitas, and quesadilla was good. Overall a good place to check out."}
{"text":"Came to borracha tonight and had a couple awesome margaritas. Rob was very knowledgeable and made me feel very welcome! Definitely gonna come back to see Rob!"}
{"text":"My favorite Tuesday spot! Seriously! All you can eat tacos and all you can drink margaritas and tequila shots for $24. The margaritas are STRONG too!"}
{"text":"The waitress was very nice. The vegan tacos omg not my thing :/. I told the waitress and she offered to get me another dish, which I appreciate but I didn't want to be disappointed again. My sister and friend enjoyed their meals. My sister said 5 stars for the king crab mini tacos."}
{"text":"Spectacular Service!   I'm mostly giving 4 stars due to the great service. From the hostess, to my waiter, to the management that worked the room making sure their customers were enjoying their food. They were very on top of providing great service and making you feel at home.   I ordered the carne asada steak street tacos, and the street corm.  The tacos were good.  Nothing extra special, but pretty much what I was expecting.  The street corn was just okay.  I think it had a bit too much lime juice on it, but I still enjoyed it.  To be fair, I have had the best street corn ever, at a place in Philadelphia, so I have a pretty high standard for greatness here.   Overall, the rating is more for the people than the food.  Don't get me wrong. My dinner was very enjoyable, just not the most memorable part of the meal.  I would give the food 3 stars, but the team working tonight brought it to a 4."}
{"text":"pleasant surprised by this place! i wasn't sure about it at first given it's inside the casino, but the food was wonderful and the margaritas were amazing! we were there for happy hour and usually the happy hour drinks are a bit smaller due to the cheaper prices, but the house margarita was fully loaded and a rather large size for only $6 bucks!! our service was fast and friendly. definitely a place ill be coming back to!   i will say, that i would only come here for the happy hour. otherwise, they drinks go from $12-$20 bucks which is a bit pricey for me. happy hour is the time to go to get a bang for your buck!!"}
{"text":"Borracha is some of the best food in town! Seriously delicious.  Came in and sat at there bar tonight and had the: empanadas- served nice and hot! Shrimp ceviche- very fresh tasting, a little spicy served with plantains, so good.  The protein bowl with Mahi Mahi- huge portion and packed full of flavor. My fiance had the al pastor chicken burrito and he said it was great.  But the real star of the night were the \"Dynamite shrimp tacos\"- these little tacos were wrapped in jicama and had a crispy sweet little shrimp in the center, these were THE best little tacos I've ever tasted, so original. Definitely recommend this place to everybody, treat yo self!"}
{"text":"Found out about this place because they had an offer on social media about $1 tacos. Decided to check it out it's absolutely beautiful inside, food was good, and Dylan was our server and he was so patient and very friendly, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We had a great time! Our server was Nick and he really helped us with the menu. The food was fast and delicious. We had the dynamite shrimp tacos... kinda small portions! Great salsa."}
{"text":"We love this place! I'm half Mexican and I can't tell you how much more I enjoy the food here over Lindo. The food here is authentic! But it is never served in watered enchilada sauce and is will never be saturated in grease. The Rellenos are amazing!!  Salsa is delicious!  Service is always friendly and outstanding!  When I leave here I'm happy!"}
{"text":"Holy happy hour! I went in today for Taco Tuesday, unlimited tacos, tequila and margaritas and I was very impressed. Only 24$ at that. Very timely and friendly staff with delicious tasting food and drinks. I will be returning for sure, as well as recommending this spot to others!"}
{"text":"Our server is Alicia , staff are so nice. They take good care of us. Woohooo love this place. First time to be here. I will recommend this to my friends"}
{"text":"Seriously! I was so pissed when my Husband passed the steak restaurant to have Mexican! I was thinking... why are we having Mexican in Vegas??? Dude! It was so flavorful! I had the appetizer sampler and loved each and every app that was there! Loved the strawberry vodka drink too! Now I'm going to think about this place when I'm back at home and can't have it! Now I'm pissed again! Lol!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance! Ashley was our server... very sweet and checked in with us several times. Drinks and guacamole are great!"}
{"text":"All you can drink tacos & tequila for $24.... dude why wouldn't you order this. STAR WAS THE BEST WAITRESS. She shows a good time and keeps the drinks coming. Quiero mas!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this new restaurant out at the recommendation of our friends. We were not disappointed! Located inside the Green Valley Ranch, this place is very hip and cozy with TV's located throughout. They have a large bar in the center, moody dark decor and a huge selection of tequilas to choose from. The menu is not huge like some places that have 20 page menus and the food is great. The chips are made fresh, including the hard taco shells. They have Street Tacos, Burritos, Ceviche, Mahi Mahi, Salmon, Chicken, Carne Asada, Al Pastor Pork, etc. Fresh Guacamole was great, as were the Carne Asada Burrito and Chicken Al Pastor Street Tacos, all with Rice & Beans. Four different flavors of Margaritas to choose from and all pitchers are $45 regardless of flavor. They have a daily Happy Hour (4pm-7pm). The service is great and staff is friendly and attentive. We look forward to visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Barely edible. Family of 5 and 1 ate their meal. The twist on Mexican isn't a good twist."}
{"text":"The chicken enchiladas were perfection.  Green sauce was spicy but not too much so.  I can't say enough about the chips and salsa.  The salsa came in a huge bowl and was brimming with veggies.  Chips were thick and still warm.  What's not to like about a free Margherita?  Excellent dinner."}
{"text":"The food and service was good. Wasn't overly wowed for the price. Decor was pretty cool but doubt I'll head back any time soon unless I'm at GVR for another reason."}
{"text":"This is not my first time here. Decided to eat there last night and once again, was NOT dissapointed. We had Mahi-mahi tacos and mahi-mahi fajitas with a side of Mexican street corn. Chips & salsa are a \"given\" and a side of guacamole. Needless to say, we left there full and satisfied. The staff has always been good but last night we were lucky enough to have \"Star\" and \"Matilda\"  as our waitresses. They both have a great knowledge of the menu, gave us some helpful hints and were just plain fun to be around. Smiling faces, hospitality, friendliness and patience is their expertise. We were able to joke around and just made to feel very comfortable. Will be back asap! Loved it. (again!)"}
{"text":"I'm a Bartender at a very high end Mexican restaurant, in Downtown Summerlin. I waited 22 minutes for my first Margarita. It was Tuesday,  so I ordered The Taco/Tequila deal, for $24. bucks. I waited so long for my second Margarita, that I decided to do cash, and carry, at the bar. The unlimited deal on Tuesday, is a joke, if you only get 1 Margarita, an hour. They were NOT that busy. If three Bartender's can't produce drinks faster, then obviously, this place is the next to meet it's demise. With this level of service, I'll give it 6 months, tops."}
{"text":"Good grief. Slow service -- and I'm at the bar! Food took forever to get...everyone apologized. It was halfway cold when they brought it out. Then they charged me full amount! Disinterested manager...and a horrible experience. Why be a Chairman player when you get treated like this?  Major fail. I will go to Hank's where they know how to treat customers."}
{"text":"Inside Green Valley Ranch. A friend invited me for lunch, omg real good fresh food. I just love the décor, the TV's for sports, the booths and tables. It can be a fun place to get nachos and watch a game and it can be awesome for a date too. We had tacos and nachos, wow a lot of food and it was good and OMG the chips they give you free w/salsa was so excellent you can tell the chips were fresh and homemade. Really, really like this place. and Oh the dishes are too cool with their name and also each plate seemed different with paintings of el dia de los muertos .. (the sculls) SO cool :) you can buy the dishes $15 a plate he said."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was a little unexpected with the classic rock music and sports on the many tv's, but the staff was friendly and the food was good. Also it was a busy Saturday night, so we had to wait a bit for visits from our waiter. I would go back, but probably on a weeknight."}
{"text":"Looking for a good time and great food this is the place to go, fantastic service and eye-popping atmosphere great for a night out with your friends, food was delicious and left me extremely satisfied"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food on this side of town hands down. Everything was so flavorful and the salsa was just the right amount of spicy. As far as atmosphere goes; awesome decor and an amazing playlist for music. The employees are all on top of things and are very professional each with their own individual authentic style."}
{"text":"To start off-the blood orange margarita is to die for!!! The food was even better and the service is excellent. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone! Love the manager, Johan and our server,Dylan! They made sure we were happy the entire time and never left a drink empty. Awesome place."}
{"text":"Great evening with great service and food.  From the moment we checked in until we cashed out everything was satisfying. Haley was our server, she was very welcoming and knowledgable about the menu.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places, not only is it a very nice place but the staff is really friendly always making sure that you are being taken care of. Every time I stop by their pork carnitas is a must! I've tryed another dishes and no matter what you order you won't be disappointed. You also can't leave without having their cinnamon churro vanilla ice cream sandwich. This is a must place to stop by and don't get me started about Taco Tuesday. All you can eat tacos, drink tequila and margaritas for only $24 bucks!"}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere was really nice. It was fun and I love the Day of the Dead theme. The drinks were really good and they have a pretty good happy hour special. The food wasn't all that great though. The ceviche was more of a shrimp cocktail. The Mexican corn was really sweet. The tacos were pretty good except the tortillas got soggy and fell apart quickly. The dessert was fabulous though. The churro ice cream sandwich was so yummy. I wouldn't mind coming back, but I'll just stick to the drinks, chips & salsa and maybe a dessert at the end."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing. Danielle was our server. She was very knowledgeable on all the drinks and food and was able to perfectly recommend things that we loved! I had the skirt steak which came with rice and beans and a super yummy chimichurri  sauce on the side. My boyfriend had the carne Asada street tacos which he loved. We had the salsa and the guacamole which was to die for. All the cocktails were absolutely delicious. They have a churro ice cream sandwich that we will be trying next time, too full this time. Totally worth the drive we made. They stopped serving food at 11 but the bar stays open much later. The manager with the red hair (I forgot his name) was also absolutely amazing, super friendly and you could tell he was super attentive and helpful with the staff. Can't give this place enough praise!"}
{"text":"My wife and I found the casino here after having dinner at a restaurant on the little street of shops.  We really like the casino and usually try to stop by once during any Vegas trip we take.  This time we stopped by on our way back from the Hoover Dam and after a little bit of gaming decided we should stay and eat dinner before heading back to the Strip.  It was a hard to choose because a bunch of the restaurants in the casino looked surprisingly good, but we ended up settling on Borracha.  First thing we got the chips and salsa, which came in a larger than average bowl, which is much appreciated when you are hungry!  I always expect the chips and salsa at a place to be good, but I absolutely loved their salsa!  I was honestly surprised.    After a look at the menu, I ordered the Tostada Salad with chicken and my wife order the hard shell traditional chicken tacos.  My salad came out in cool bowl and tasted pretty good.  Nothing mind blowing, but it was a good salad.  My wife, on the other hand, was not a big fan of her tacos.  They came in what looked like premade hard shells you buy at the store.  She was pretty disappointed, and I don't blame her.  I felt bad she wasn't having the same experience I was having.      The server was great though, she decided she wasn't as hungry as she thought and only wanted the rice and beans, and the server agreed to only charge us for the side of rice and beans.    Overall, I liked this place a lot and I would come back if we are in the casino again.  Maybe just try different things next time."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite signature spots in town for mexican food. It's inside the beautiful GVR hotel. Will definitely be recommending to my friends and family."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this new spot!!! The staff was extremely nice, the ambiance was amazing and the food was delicious! My girls and I had the shrimp ceviche, king crab tacos, short rib skewers and they were the perfect appetizers. My blood orange margarita was the perfect drink to complement the food! The churro with vanilla ice cream was the most delightful dessert that I've had in a long time... So much so, that we ordered two!! Definitely coming back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Celebrated a friends birthday and this place was great! The atmosphere and staff were on top of it. Skyy was our server and she was awesome! Try the blood orange margaritas!!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. Went with my wife and 3 year old. The restaurant is inside the casino so just FYI. Also the music was really loud so conversation was difficult and my little one wasn't liking it. Otherwise the overall experience was good just don't expect a quiet conversation."}
{"text":"Excellent Mahi burrito and margarita! Hayley waited on us at bar and did a great job taking care of all of her patrons. Would definitely go back again .. delish!!"}
{"text":"4 and a half is really the rating.  Can't do a perfect 5 because they did have a few challenges.  Overall the absolute BEST SALSA I have ever tasted.  You can tell they make it with only the freshest ingredients.  But the number one thing is - great value!  Our bill was $32 for 3 of us and we had 3 drinks.  A free Margarita each with a Yelp check in.  And they are delicious!  A ton of great Tequila options.  So Tuesday is Taco Tequila all you can eat and drink for 25$.  It was too much for us, but the crowd was growing fast.  I could seriously see no tables left by 8pm.  If you have a huge appetite or a desire to get really buzzed for cheap then this is your place!  Tacos were ok.  Honestly the best part of this place is the value, plus the chips and salsa.  Located inside the Green Valley Casino in Henderson - just a few miles from the strip in Vegas but much classier and upscale location.  Love the decor, superb service.  Only thing that gave some back is that they did not bring out what I ordered at first -brought flour tortilla vs corn AND the asada steak was not tasty (more chewy and overcooked).  We had half price tacos rather than all you can eat.  Can't beat the price!!!  I will be back many many times!  Probably for appetizers and drinks - located inside the casino makes it a fun destination spot."}
{"text":"Watered down drinks, super slow service with an extra side of attitude (on a super slow night). Had to chase down our server for chips, water, etc. bummer because reviews were great. Would never go back again. Treated locals like crap, not a way to get repeat business. When we spoke to the manager all he could offer was 20% off next visit. No thanks."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday lunch for my cousin and loved the atmosphere. The service was pretty stellar. Loved the free yelp check-in margaritas. I had the vegan chile relleno and my cousin had the regular. She loved hers, I loved mine. While I'm more vegetarian than vegan, I love seeing vegan options on the menu and love to try them. The chips and salsa were great. Sometimes chips can be pretty generic tasting. These were fresh and perfectly salted. The salsa was tasty with a tiny kick. I look forward to coming back and trying more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Call before going to happy hour!!!   Happy hour is advertised till 7pm on signs outside the hotel near the district shopping center however when you get there the menu and bartender says it's only till 6. One star for false advertising!  Sham on stations casino !"}
{"text":"I am keto and they have Jicama tacos!!! Are u freakin kidding me! Always have great service and drinks are amazing! Jalapeño margaritas are great if u like spicy."}
{"text":"What a great find! We went for dinner last night and loved it! We tried many small dishes and every single one was excellent. We tried both types of street tacos, chicken nachos, crunchy chicken tostadas, and cheese quesadilla. Our waiter was extremely helpful and attentive. The complimentary chips and salsa was also on point. We will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Met friends here for my birthday and fell head over heels in love with the queso fundido, the staff and atmosphere. Great staff, terrific food and close to home! Happy hour specials are fantastic and well priced!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican cantina I have been to in a while, had great service, the tacos were delusions, and I came on the best day Tuesday where it's happy hour, so I had a few drinks and some tacos it was great thank you guys keep it up..."}
{"text":"..always look forward to a visit.. lots great choices.. ..at the bar Rob recommended the ceviche.. and it was outstansing.. great service..goid food.. reasonsble prices.. a favorite happy hour in Henderson"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service! The chips and guacamole are delicious!  Thanks Diane for the positive attitude and taking care of us right away! Will be coming back for the happy hour! Inexpensive drinks but not holding back on the alcohol! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Very good food and drinks. Place is clean and easy to get to. I love the steak fajitas and house margaritas. Highly recommend this place. It's super casual"}
{"text":"Borracha was amazing. Johann and Rob were awesome. The fajitas were delicious, Jesus and Edgar rocked it. The atmosphere is chill yet fun. Location is great and desserts were amazing!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit here. It's a small restaurant inside of GVR but has an amazing ambience. I love the decorations and lighting. We were greeting by the hostess and sat immediately. There was NBA on huge flat screens which made watching the playoffs easier. The server brought my my free MARGARITA with check in which was awesome.   I ordered the chicken enchiladas. It was super tasty. The rice wasn't my favorite though, but all good  My dad ordered the carne Asada street tacos and they came in a cute bucket with chips and salsa.   I ordered the appetizer cheese quesadilla for my son which was served on a wood board. I loved the presentation.   My favorite was the plates. They had a great decor on them. See photo...  All in all, great portions, great service, and inside of one of my favorite station casinos."}
{"text":"Went to go for Taco Tuesdays! Hostess told us it was a 1.5 hour wait. Luckily we went to the bar there was two seats and we didn't have to wait. Edgar was the bartender who accommodated everything! From the first drink to the last. Definitely will come back because of the amazing service. $24 all you can eat and Casamigos. . Go see Edgar."}
{"text":"The service was awesome, james our server went above and beyond even while he was slammed on a busy Tuesday. Very attentive, fast service and did everything with a smile. Very impressed keeping up with the demands of a unlimited tacos and tequila Tuesday. James killed it, and will be coming back for sure. Awesome atmosphere, friendly service and very comfortable environment to enjoy an evening with friends."}
{"text":"the ambience is so so the 24 dollars for margaritas n tacos are so not worth it so many wrap up tacos with more ice than actual margarita definitely not coming back then i tell the waiter its my friends bday n they bring her wack ass ice cream outside by the slot machine so tacky! then the hostess looks lazy as hell bad service."}
{"text":"My favorite taco Tuesday spot hands down! All the food is amazing and the staff is so polite and friendly. This is always my go to place when having friends in town and looking to have a good time."}
{"text":"What a fabulous experience and a tremendous bartender if you're at Borracha ask for Rob and he will take great care of you!!  If you want great eye candy and some sassy fun come to Borracha and see Rob! Great happy hour and great margaritas"}
{"text":"My friends and I don't live in Nevada and we were looking for a place to watch Super Bowl over the weekend. All the casinos on the strip were quite pricey for an underwhelming menu so we decided to look outside Las Vegas Blvd. $30 plus tax for all you can eat from a pre-set menu was pretty impressive for the big game, but I have to admit that I was expecting average since it seemed too good to be true.  Not only was the service exceptional (our waitress was Haley but this includes the other staff members), the food far exceeded my expectations. I'm not a food snob by any means but I have to be extremely impressed in order to write a review. The staff, especially Haley were friendly, attentive, and prompt to our group of nine.  The menu included street tacos, nachos, chips and salsa, cheese quesadilla, pulled pork sandwich, chimichangas, and tostada salad - all, in my opinion, were quite delicious. I made it a point to try everything. There was nothing lacking in flavor in any of their dishes but my favorite was the tostada salad. The fresh crisp vegetables and light vinaigrette were refreshing after a heavy meal.  I will definitely come back here. If their pre-set menu for Super Bowl was fantastic, I can't wait to try their regular menu."}
{"text":"Haley was our server. She did a great job serving our group of 14. Food was good and the drinks were on point. Great local neighborhood restaurant. We will be back"}
{"text":"Nice contemporary Mexican place  , fun to catch up with a friend or grab a bite to eat . Try shrimp  ceviche or pork carnitas,  very good. The management takes very good care of the place and the customers . Convenient location in the heart of green valley.  Networking mixers are always fun there as well!"}
{"text":"Service here is prompt and courteous. We enjoy filling up on the complimentary fresh salsa and warmed tortilla chips. Their menu has a great selection of appetizers and full plate entrées. A kids menu is available with crayons to keep them happy. Their bar is in the center of the restaurant and they serve up delicious margaritas and craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"So so happy that there is a mexican restaurant at GVR now! This place is definitely going to bey new favorite place to get my taco grub on !"}
{"text":"Currently having lunch and literally couldn't wait to post this! Joaquin is such an amazing server! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere right off casino floor. Food was tasty - we ordered appetizer sampler, chicken traditional tacos, and carne asada street tacos. Taquitos, carne asada toast, street tacos, and salsa were our favorite dishes. Chicken tacos had mayonnaise in them which was not my thing. Everything was fresh, flavorful, and not greasy. Not traditional Mexican but nice flavors. Tres leches desert was a bit too heavy."}
{"text":"Dylan was our server and worked his butt off even though there was only 4 tables full. If you like quick attentive service this is your place. I will definitely be back. When the food arrived it was presented well and it tasted fantastic. I would obviously recommend highly."}
{"text":"Everyone really enjoyed their meal! Margaritas were strong, drafts are $5 during college and pro football games, and the food was excellent! I had the BBQ chicken tamale cakes (an appetizer) + the street corn side , my husband had the chicken street tacos and our friends had shrimp and chicken fajitas!- all great!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! You get a free margarita with Yelp check in which is awesome! It's not a tiny one either, it's a regular one. I ordered the regular carne asada tacos that come with beans and rice. The tacos were great the rice was bland but that's okay.  I'll be back here again because the service was great and the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"I agree with Topher.  We drove down for the grand opening that was advertised online and on a flyer we received in the mail to find out there was a private party of about 12 people (if that) until 7pm and then the restaurant was \"fully committed\" until 10p.  However complimentary shots of tequila were offered at Drop Bar across the casino floor-too little, too late. We decided to go to Hank's across the way...even though they are often busy, they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Great food and our bartender Rob was great!! Kept the drinks coming and made amazing recommendations for the menu and what to try! Pork carnitas were sooo good!!"}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed in a restaurant in my life.... the blood orange Margarita was great.....the 15 dollar shit of tequila was great... .I was brought very old tortillas for my fajitas...the street corn was sour...and after both of those complaints...the manager never came to our table.....he touched 5 tables around us...but not ours....our waitress was very nice....but even she should have brought him over....I have been in this business as a manager for almost  30 years....you will never get my business again"}
{"text":"This place has super delicious food! Love the salsa! Lots of cilantro! The guac is so fresh & yummy! I get the fish tacos every time & they are always sooo good. My husband gets chicken fajitas & loves them. Their margaritas are amazing & if u check in on yelp, u will receive a coupon for a free one! Don't hesitate to try this place out, u won't b disappointed."}
{"text":"The mahi mahi burrito was huge and quite delicious. The fresh guacamole was not spicy. The wait wasn't bad for a Saturday night. A great Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Our waitress Hayley was amazing! So personable and a great communicator. She was very attentive and we appreciate amazing customer service.   The food wasn't too shabby either. The salsa wasn't our favorite pretty basic but not horrible. The drinks were really good too."}
{"text":"Great concept & Idea however poor design.  The noise level is awful!  You cant hear the person next to you. The tables are so close together you run into people.     Drinks:  a long wait - the process needs to be reviewed as the staff line up for drinks.  Its a casino-- go automated on the orders.  The beverages are also pricey.   Food:  one word--  Delish!!!!!  Portions are small but the flavor is amazing.  A little price challenge and portion overview would benefit this place greatly.   Staff:  friendly to consumers however there are a lot of snarky undertones and glares amongst each other.  Its evident the staff do not get along."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The staff is the reason for the low rating. I felt very disrespected by our waitress (bleach blonde with exaggerated cat eyes). She touched my husband EVERY time she came to our table. She made sure to have his drinks full and IGNORED the other 3 empty glasses at the table. The appetizer (cheese dip) took about 30 minutes to get to the table. The food another 30 minutes (tacos). I ordered chicken tacos and received steak. I sent them back and got chicken tacos within 5 minutes. The restaurant was NOT busy, maybe the kitchen was short staffed. If the margaritas weren't so good I would have left. The food was worth the visit, just watch out for the waitress mentioned above.. ask for another!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My husband and I come here about twice a month. The food has lots of flavor, they give you free chips and salsa, and a free margarita with the Yelp check-in offer! The tostadas and the chicken quesadilla are delicious. The steak tacos are good too! :)"}
{"text":"Will never go back to this restaurant due to poor customer service. Our server, James, was rude (I'm young, and it was just bad) and we had to flag him down to take our order after quite a while. When we finished dinner, I gave him my rewards card to get the points, and he said that he could only take that if I was redeeming a comp with it for dinner. I said I just wanted the points and he said they didn't do that. Later that evening, I went to the Rewards Center and they told me that the restaurant had to add the points and they could not. I went back to the restaurant and spoke with what appeared to be a manager. He insinuated that we had not paid our check, which we had 2 hours ago, and then told me he'd have to go through all this work to add the points back. It was clearly a hassle for him, so I just told him not to bother and left. What a poor experience! I'm in the hospitality industry and hope we'd never treat a guest like this. Especially one who is trying to use their loyalty card."}
{"text":"First time here. I live in the area. Waited about 30 min after we ordered and no food came out. Asked the waitress to check on our meal she came back and said it was gonna be one more minute. we were so full from the chips and salsa we asked to just give us our bill so we could leave. Took a really long time I don't think I'll be back. The manager did come over and said we do not have to pay for our appetizers which I felt was fair. The chips and salsa were great and the ice tea and Arnold Palmer was really good."}
{"text":"Try the coconut ceviche and the tortilla soup . All together good restaurant and worth it"}
{"text":"Great specials throughout the week. Happy Hour and taste to share menu offer a ton of options and are good for sharing. Really great drink specials during football as well. If you're really hungry the pork carnitas are the way to go! Dynamite shrimp tacos are a must! As for specialty cocktails the new Mexican sunset is amazing!"}
{"text":"Food menu is very limited compared to other Mexican restaurants. Alcohol drinks are over powering. Don't get me wrong I like a strong drink!! But it's too much to the point it's not enjoyable. Tried it once. Will I come back? No. been to other station casino restaurants that are much better."}
{"text":"We have been coming here on a weekly basis since we live across the street from the casino. The food and service has progressively been getting worse and worse.  Fast food quality and out rages prices. The last time we came here the restaurant was empty there were only two tables worth of customers,  we were here at 4:30 PM in the afternoon and we were told we could not be seated because they have other customers coming.  Not ever coming back here and you shouldn't either!!!Rude hostess wouldn't even get off the phone for 15 min before she even talked to us and told us we can't sit here! Wow!!! Management should read some of these reviews cause your restaurant and service sucks!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service!  Super friendly staff and great atmosphere.  We sat at the bar and had great bartenders.  Haley did a great job attending to our needs and giving recommendations.  She is super sweet too!  I think this is a place not just for tourists but locals too!   The chips and BOWL of salsa were amazing!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Been here twice because I really want to like this place.  Fun ambiance. That's about it.  Margaritas are cheap tasting with way too much mixer.  The service is fair but they seem to be all about speed, instead of good service.  The food:  Can you spell S-A-L-T-Y.  5 of us at the table and none of us finished our food and all complained about how salty their dish was."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic! Try the carnitas if you want a real treat. Service is also great, and the atmosphere is fun.   My only complaint is about the hostesses. We walked up and there were many open tables but they insisted there was a wait. No other people hanging around, so we gave our phone number for a call when it was ready.   20 minutes later we walked back over, still most of the same open tables, but no call yet. I asked about a table and they magically found a one for us. Seems silly to leave people waiting for no reason.   Oh well, the great food made us forget about all that!!!"}
{"text":"New date night spot totally. Happy hour has some seriously delicious chicken nachos and super cheap, big, strong margaritas. We had an excellent server. I think there may have been a slight disconnect from the hostess though because we informed them of a birthday but there was no recognition of it which was sort of disappointment but great for a nice meal with friends!"}
{"text":"Just ate at Boracha and it was delicious.  Stephanie was our bartender and she did great, even with a special order Manhattan.    We had the Crispy Dynamite Shrimp tacos and you WILL NOT GO WRONG if you order these.  Also had the shrimp Ceviche and it's one of the freshest and tastiest I have had in a restaurant in a long time.  Second note on Stephanie, I watched her give great service to Rogers all over the bar and even got a discounted bill to 2 people who had an extra long wait for their food without them asking.  That's exceptional service in my book and very rare.  We are locals and will definitely back to see this many and Stephanie!"}
{"text":"Street Tacos and Tequila? Yes, please! I have only been here once but enjoyed it enough to return. The food was quite tasty and the service was fast and attentive."}
{"text":"Ok my peeps.  Live review.  Part 1 of 2.  Liking this olace already.  Service is strong.  Chips and salsa very good.  Coctails very good.  Onky Mega problem is the place os FREEZING.  Like shrink your cajones FREEZING.  They told me they couldn't fix for a couple days.  I prolly won't be here that long...  Part 2.  Loving this place even more.  AC turned warmer.  Food amazeballs.  Shrimp ceviche way on point.  Did i mention coctails are awesome?  Definite go back Soon!"}
{"text":"Couldn't get anyone including the manager to help get something to eat or drink and sat there for 30 minuets. All the employees were not interested in serving food just hanging out and talking to each other. Just left with no dinner and now at fat burger when we just wanted fajita. Never coming back"}
{"text":"This was a great Mexican food experience for my mother and me (and we're picky about our Mexican food). The fajitas were seasoned fantastically and the Mahi Mahi tacos were a grilled delight. Moreover the service was perfection. Ask for Haley if she's available - she recommended the new tequila flight and it will be a must for our future visits :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food, (absolutely love their salsa)with a gluten free menu as well . I have celiac disease & have not been sick after eating off their gluten free menu  it is very small & fills up fast .. so make a reservation!  Make sure you get a first & last name of the person , I have had issues with my reservations here in the past (why I didn't put 5 stars) ."}
{"text":"Horrific customer service. Was seated at 10:45 and immediately informed by Alicia we had just 15 min to order and eat. Requested to speak to a manager -- after 20 min a \"Manager\" (looked about 19 years old) came to the table with an insincere and lame apology. Complained to him about the poor attitude of the server and he feigned concern. Food arrived pretty quickly and was promptly followed up with a bar back who brought plastic cups urging us to transfer our drinks and get out. A terrible experience. Do not recommend......"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place gets so many four and five star reviews. Maybe most of these people go for drinks and happy hour. To me, it's just another typical example of how easy it is to get lousy Mexican food in Las Vegas. Our server was friendly and attractive, but I felt she served us too slowly as we waited a long time for chips, salsa and drinks. The best thing on the table was the salsa that comes with the chips. It's quite zesty and delicious. As for the food, I ordered chicken enchiladas. They were small, dry and bland. There was virtually no sauce on top of them. It's like the dish sat under a heat lamp for 5 minutes and dried up. I ate one of the three enchiladas and let my friends take a bite of the others. They didn't like it either. We also ordered a Tostada salad. Instead of coming in a crispy tortilla, it was served in an attractive wood bowl. The salad was not good. We asked for the chicken to be hot on the salad. It was just above cold. Microwaved? It didn't seem to have any dressing on it. The salad was boring and dry. We also ordered chicken tacos in flour tortillas. The tortillas break apart and crumble when you pick them up. Like the enchiladas, the tacos were also dry and bland. The whole thing was pretty bogus. Even the Margarita wasn't that great. I would not eat here again, but I would consider going to the bar for a beer with friends. The atmosphere isn't bad. They have an extensive selection of Tequila, but at high prices per shot. Minimum for a shot is $9. El Tesoro and Casa Noble starts at $12. Clase Azul Anejo is $85 a shot. I'd probably swing in there with a couple friends for a drink or two and pass on the food."}
{"text":"We continue to come to Borracha and atis turned into our local spot to go for quality Mexican food and a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came in just for some drinks and guacamole, sat at the bar. Rob and Jesus were great got my drinks right away and food right after. Tasted amazing as always. Can't wait to be back for taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Margaritas are great. Very comfortable atmosphere. Great happy hour prices and real food on the happy hour menu, not just aps."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! 3 x now every time servers are so friendly and the food is wonderful. Salsa is amazing and the Carne Asada quesadillas are awesome. Easy to get to go food here as well"}
{"text":"Borracha is so good.  It is my go to place when I have family and friends in town.  I love the happy hour.  The street tacos and roasted corn salad are my favorite. I feel like I am eating a little healthy. The dinner menu is wonderful.  A lot of different and unique items. Margaritas are really good and not to sweet. Wonderful staff.  Last night Hayley was our server.  She is the best!!  Friendly, fast and so knowledgeable of menu items.  The manager Zach was going around to the tables to make sure all the quests were happy.  So cool.  Try it, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ate here about 2 weeks ago. Food was great. They got us seated rite away & the staff was very friendly. I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Ask for my boy Rob, he will take care of you. I had the pork carnitas, which was the recommended dish by him. It was excellent!!! This place is Recommended *****."}
{"text":"Incredible! Had the El pastor chicken tacos which were amazing. The guacamole was amazing too. Our server Ashley was super nice and helpful and full of joy. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The service was fast and great! The tacos are amazing! They bring out salsa and chips before you order. You can't beat the deal they have for taco Tuesday $24 all you can eat and drink! I highly recommend Borracha!!"}
{"text":"Great food & great service from Skyy! Corn salad is a must try! And the passion fruit margarita"}
{"text":"Back home where I am from I always used to go to this mexican restaurant called Puerto Vallarta and they had the best salsa ever! Borracha has a salsa that is almost the exact same and tastes so good! This restaurant has great mexican food and although its nothing like you would get in california or texas it is very delicious."}
{"text":"Holy smokes the place to be on Tuesday night! With the happy hour on Tuesday! Adrienne was my server tonight and what a GREAT server! She took care of us so well and was the best on a Tuesday night when it was really busy. As a table of 3 and a table of 30 next to us, she took care of us I felt like way better, if you are in Las Vegas come here any time it's a great time and a fun time!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food in town and the huge margaritas are a yummy bonus. The staff has customer service to the tee. Love this place"}
{"text":"Did someone say FREE MARGARITA?! Heck yeah! Check in offer on yelp will get you a free house margarita, can't go wrong with that!   Decided to make reservations for my craving of Mexican food since I moved to town. I was able to make reservations on the same day thanks to the yelp app.    It was definitely a different vibe for a Mexican restaurant being that it was in a hotel and surrounded by giant tvs surrounding their bar, but I loved the ambiance!   Sat down and was immediately served complimentary chips & salsa. Winner! And of course with the house margarita. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and was not disappointed. The rice & beans were tasty as was the enchiladas with the sauce & cheese melted on top. My boyfriend got the carnitas plate and finished everything on the plate, nothing more to say there.  Their prices are very reasonable for being in a hotel! I will be back to try their tacos... and another round of margaritas :)"}
{"text":"Came for happy hour.  Love the decor and the plates are so awesome I wish they sold them.  They also give you a margarita for checking in, and they're delicious.  Their guacamole is awesome but hands down the salsa that comes with the chips is amazing, absolutely delicious... and it's free.  I had the street tacos, pollo asada and carne Asada... both were just Linda bland and needed salsa, cilantro, onions, more lime juice.. so they do have some potential.. other things on the menu sound good as well, so we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was my second experience at Borracha and it did not disappoint! A few co-workers decided to get together for Taco Tuesday to celebrate our managers birthday and a going away for a beloved co-worker. We chose Borracha as we had been there a few months prior for a team outing and  enjoyed the vibe and amazing food and drink it serves. What started out as a party of 8 quickly grew to 16 and then 20, but we were not troubled, only accommodated. As we all work in the hospitality/service industry we knew what it's like to be on the other side of such an outlandish request and the need to execute it in a timely manner as the crowd grew. Hayley came to the rescue! She was nothing but professional, accommodating and so kind in regards to all our requests and such a great asset to the Borracha team! We will continue to recommend this restaurant and will visit as often as we can. Thanks again, Hayley!"}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere, but the food really is not that great. My boyfriend ordered the enchiladas and did not like it at all. I had the steak tacos. Nothing special...!! We will not dine here again."}
{"text":"At first I thought this place would be awesome. Day of the dead themed bar?! Amazing. As I sat there I thought wow, why so many bad reviews? I checked in and got the free margarita. That was pretty good, 4.5 stars. I ordered an appetizer since I thought the price of entrees were a little high (around $17-$20ish). I ordered the tostadas, told the bartender no meat. They came out on a wooden board and piled high. I realized for $11 you're paying more for look, not for quantity. But that's OK, it's whatever you're going for. I bit into the small tostada (about the size of a large chip) and realized - there's meat in this. I've been vegetarian for over 11 years, so this is very upsetting. I spit it in my napkin. I asked the bartender to check and indeed it had chicken. Advised her I'm vegetarian. They redid the tostadas and what came out was pathetic. It was like 3 different sauces on small tostadas. I ordered another maragarita, they comped the appetizer, and I felt a little better. This is not the bartenders fault at all but the kitchen. I understand they are new. Borrachas, I wanted to like you so much  Giving it one star because of the good margarita and chips and salsa, which is like pico de gallo, one star for decor, and -3 for feeding a vegetarian meat. Picture included of the pathetic tostadas after they made new ones, it's literally like chips dipped in sauces."}
{"text":"The Service has always been on point! There may be a wait at the door if you don't have reservations but they are always very nice and courteous. I highly recommend making a reservation just to be safe though.   I absolutely love the atmosphere, vibe and art of this place!!! It's One of my favorite happy hours joints in town!! The food is absolutely delicious! My favorites are the quesadillas, the coconut shrimp tacos on jicama shells!YUM! They're fajitas are also to die for! Definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"We had a huge group and they were able to sit us fairly quickly. Ari at the front is awesome and so helpful. They have $24 all you can eat tacos/all you can drink tequila shots and margaritas. WHERE ELSE WILL YOU FIND THAT?! That's amazing. The whole staff was attentive and overall so friendly. We had a great experience. We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I like how they designed the place. Everyone is nice and give good service. The food looks very good. Very well presented but it's not as good as it looks. Except the flan that was really good.   I wanted a virgin margarita because I'm pregnant and the ran out of two favors and one of them was mango I really wanted to try that and the guy said honestly it's not that good with out the liquor well thanks for the heads up so I skipped on that. Plus I like my margaritas blended not on rocks.   They give you salsa and chips to start. Nice way to start. Chips are warm seem fresh yum. Salsa is like the kind that you buy at the super market in the dip section. And not spicy at all.  Anyways I kind of force my self to eat the food and are bill was $50 I don't think it was worth it I've gone to smaller restaurants I pay way less and that food was amazing so I don't think I will be going again even tho I did like the staff.   Ok it has the word Mexican but it's not spicy. We like spice. My husbands chicken tasted to much lemon. Mine not enough flavor."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place after wanting to for a while.  I had high hopes and they were not met at all.  My buddy and I sat at the bar.  When we sat down, there was a bartender right in front of us, but he did not greet us or or even acknowledge our existence.  I put some money in the video poker machine (they do have gaming which is nice).  We sat there for a good 10 to 15 minutes before he came over to greet us.  I asked for a happy hour menu.  He said happy hour is over.  It was 6 pm so I asked him what time it ends and he said 7 pm.  Then, he was like \"oh, whoops\" and gave us the happy hour menu.  We ordered the street tacos, one chicken and one carne asade.  Then we waited and waited and waited.  Finally the tacos arrived like 20 minutes later.  They were wrapped up in foil for some reason, so they became wet from the steam.  The tortilla was all mushy and they were very sloppy, like they were slapped together quickly with no care.  They did not taste that great either.  They had no fresh toppings like cilantro or cheese or even limes.  They were just meat thrown in a tortilla and wrapped up like they were to go.  This place might want to go to Mi Gusto Taco at the District to see how good, fresh tacos are made.  Also, we asked for Tito's vodka and the bartender said that is not free for players.  Um, okay, but lame.  All and all, nothing went well here.  Service and food were not good.  They need serious improvement in all areas."}
{"text":"Amazing chips and salsa and even better steak fajitas!!!the service is fast and friendly. A bit more on the pricey side but the food is worth the price!!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Service was good. If you prefer an intimate dining experience, this is not the place. We went around 6:30pm and it was loud and hard to hear our conversations. Mostly because the people gathered around the circular bar for happy hour."}
{"text":"I showed up on a Tuesday night without a reservation, unbeknownst to me this is one of their busiest days due to their all you can eat tacos and margaritas for $24. Ari greeted us and was a delight but informed us of an hour and a half weight. She took our information and we walked off to the side to discuss our options and before we could come to a conclusion she came over and informed us that a reservation had canceled and she was able to get us in right way. She was fantastic! The great service didn't stop there however! Star was our waitress and I can't sing enough praise! She informed us of the the taco Tuesday special and without any needed persuasion we found ourselves indulging in all you can eat tacos and margaritas! There was never a moment I found myself wanting... She was extremely attentive and made sure we always had food to eat and tequila to consume. This was my first time here and it will most certainly not be my last. Thank you Ari & Star!!! It is a testament to the service when I created a yelp account just to place this review."}
{"text":"Meh, expensive for subpar Mexican food. Happy hour food and beverage pricing is a joke. Beers are regular priced $6-7 and happy hour they are all $6. Geez, thanks!"}
{"text":"At Borracha with the USC alumni. Haley is an awesome waitress. The restaurant is packed but the service is excellent. The carnitas are fantastic."}
{"text":"I had a voucher from Station casinos and it was valid at many of their properties and I decided to make the drive to Henderson to check out Borracha, the new Mexican restaurant at that property and sister to Libre at Red Rock.  I was brought my iced tea quickly along with a glass of water.  The tea was refilled throughout my time there.  I ordered the pork carnitas and a side of Mexican street corn.  The carnitas were served differently than most places.  Instead of getting pork that has been shredded off and plated, this pork came in a cast iron round pan and was pretty much a solid piece of pork that you just pulled on with your fork and the tender pork came away.  It was excellent and the meat stayed much juicier served this way.  The Mexican street corn was good but I should have asked for some extra cotija cheese to give it a bit more of the street corn flavor since it was off the cob and had not been brushed with mayo.  It was good nonetheless.  For dessert, I got something they serve that is quite different.  Their warm rice pudding is served with corn flakes on top, dusted with cinnamon, and topped with whipped cream.  The soft texture of the rice pudding with the crunchiness of the flakes made this a memorable dessert.  My server was James and he was great!  He told me about the rice pudding, advised me it would be about 10 minutes, and then brought it for me to enjoy.  I really liked my experience at Borracha and it will be a place to which I return."}
{"text":"Hayley was really great! We came on National Tequila Day and they really were great with their service. The tequila was good, live band was very interactive and the food was great! The food was very good."}
{"text":"Food wasn't very good, pretty bad for mexican.  Also pretty overpriced with pretty small portions.  It's in green valley ranch but not affiliated with stations so you cant use your comps or any coupons you have for Gvr restaurants. Probably won't ever come back."}
{"text":"Thank you Guy for the great grub, but mostly for the best experience we had in Vegas this trip. Sal was great, but your darling \"Enchi\" Lada is what salvaged our hope in dining. Her passion for her job and genuine care for her her customers just can't help but make you feel special.Kudos Lada for being a stand out!"}
{"text":"The warm tortilla chips and salsa were awesome, the sampler plater is very tasty, stay away from the Ceviche and order a well made margarita.  The decor is pretty and parking was abundant on that side of GV."}
{"text":"Friendly service.   Stopped by for happy hour and we tried the nachos and street tacos. It was very tasty and a good value. The salsa and guacamole was very good as well. They have slots at the bar if you would like to gamble while you dine."}
{"text":"Came in on a friday for late night happy hour/dinner. There were about 6 menu items for $6, and house margaritas, wine, beer, and draft cocktails for $6. They are located in the far corner of casino.    Chicken Tacos: chicken was tender. Taco was mostly tortilla. They came wrapped in foil, so they remained hot. Ordinary taco. No fresh cilantro, onions or toppings.  HH tostadas: Very good, but very small. They fit in the palm of my hand. The shell is light and crispy, the creamy sauce is amazing!   The star of the meal was Dynamite Shrimp tacos. The shell is made of jicama. It has just the right crunch. The shrimp is also crispy and slathered in the delish Dynamite sauce. They are priced a lil high for only 4 mini tacos - $15  I ordered the Heat of the Moment Margarita! Very good. I couldnt taste any liquor. Nice and smooth with just a hint of spice.   Tres Leches: Soupy, the cake was a litle stale."}
{"text":"My first visit here was this Thursday night. Service was a little slow, but it felt like they were just understaffed rather than inattentive (the staff all seemed to be working hard, so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that this is abnormal). The food and margaritas were fantastic! The free margarita I got for the Yelp check-in was delicious! It was a real margarita - none of that sweet and sour junk! And surprisingly strong for a freebie! My boyfriend and I shared the appetizer sampler. I don't think we'd get the sampler again, but the flautas were the clear standout on that plate. Absolutely delicious! The empanadas were fine (a little dry perhaps), the tostadas were over-seasoned, and the quesadillas were nothing standout. For an entree, I got the carnitas, which was amazing! Really well-developed flavor and cooked perfectly. My boyfriend was quite happy with his fish tacos. I liked that the ambience of the restaurant allowed us to forget we were in a casino, too."}
{"text":"Food was ok but trendy. Service not good. Nobody knew how to change the tv channels and I missed half the game I wanted to watch. Not a place to get excited about."}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner on Mother's Day and this time it was not for work but for pleasure, and brought the twins. It is a beautiful restaurant that plays classic rock and has sports on the tele. What could be better? Except the best tacos well this is one of my favorite taco places to indulge in great tacos with fantastic service.   Since it was Mother's Day, I was given a free pitcher of Sangria for just being mom. It was so refreshing and smooth since they only use top shelf liquor here. I had the fajitas since our server recommended them but asked for side sour cream which does not normally come with it. The fajitas were so sizzling and the steak was so soft. They just melted in my mouth.   Since I was dining with the kids we ordered two other plates I which I got to have an a la carte type of dinner. Those dining choices were the street tacos and the taco plate. The taco plate was in steak with side of sour cream. This plate comes with rice and beans too. The street tacos only comes with chips, but the tacos are large and I added cheese to them and held the salsa. All these taco plates were great too."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place for National Margarita Day, as well as for an Internations event.  The Blood Orange marg was good, but the food was not authentic at all. The Mahi Mahi tacos had too much slaw on it-- with way too much mayo. The Tacos al Pastor were nothing close to what al pastor should taste like and lacked the piña, cebolla, and cilantro-- came with shredded cabbage instead.  And the salsa clearly came from a jar/can."}
{"text":"Cute place, not a quiet place, a VERY long wait, service was alright, pricey food but, seriously, the Mexican Street Corn was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't waste your money. Lowest common denominator Mexican food, and way over priced.  My sister had small rubbery shrimp, I had street tacos a higher were very average. My vodka tonic had absolutely NO vodka, and the wait staff didn't once clear any plates or fill up our water glasses.  So many better places to eat at Green Valley ... Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"There is always room for a second chance. After our first attempt at Borracha Mexican Cantina, we were kindly invited back by the general manager Craig to give them a try.   Booked our reservation, and a complimentary meal for a second chance. Here we are, got seated straight away to a smiling staff. Craig came by to greet me (not even greeting my partner) with a handshake and a confident \"we will take care of you, thank you for giving us a second chance.\" We ordered two drinks, I ordered the classic Margarita, if there is one thing to test is a margarita. I am a Texan after all and our water is either a cold beer or a frozen margarita.   The margarita is lite, not sour, not too sweet, cold, full of ice, and garnished with a lime. Level of alcohol, is moderate. Now, the One Eyed Willy, (a tribute to the beloved Goonies film I'm guessing) that's a drink to consider. It's served in a skull, topped with a flaming pineapple and lime stalk, again alcohol is moderate, and not sure if it matches the price tag in the menu. The Pinche Pina, suppose to be like a Pina colada, but more like a lime mojito. It seems to me that any restaurant in a casino overcharges for drinks that are light on actual alcohol. It's a pity, because the price should reflect what you are buying. (for us, we didn't have to pay this time, but . . . I'd be upset if I was buying, sometimes you are better off with a bottled beer, at least you know the value is always there.)  I ordered a skirt steak dinner, asked for my steak to be medium and got a medium rare. I am not into bloody steak. Had to send it back, yet, they were very accommodating, the steak was sent back to the grill for a few more minutes. The same steak was returned to me, with an apology from Craig, the plate was redressed with fresh refried beans and rice. The beans and rice, not anything special, was expecting more flavor, feels like any corner taco stand recipe. The salsa is the best bit of the meal, it's fresh, tastes fantastic, a perfect balance of lime, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and garlic. Chips are good, not greasy, a nice flavor, but feel like they are not made on site, maybe warmed up, but feel store bought.  Now onto dessert. The Tres Leche Cake. A small square cut of pound like vanilla cake swimming in a bowl of horchata like cream, with a simple dollop of whipped cream, a mint leaf placed on the top for garnish. The denseness of the cake is nice, soaked in the cream gives it an interestingly sweet flavor as the cake melts in your mouth. Overall taste of the dessert is nice, not sure it was my favorite thing. Warning, taking a swig from the One Eyed Willy after is not a smart idea. Booze and cream, no bueno. giggle  Overall second chance experience was nice, hated the music, it's too loud to hold any conversation with your dinner guests. The flat screens placed around the dining/bar area are absolutely annoying as they are all playing distracting sports. The decor is clean, nicely done with slight touches reflecting some of the Mexican and historic culture. Overall, I think Borracha is a nice bar atmosphere but not a family environment. The staff is nice, efficient. This Mexican Cantina is not a high end Mexican experience, but perfect for a casino bar/food environment. Haley our server was super knowledgeable and attentive.   Amazing artwork by Kyle Gibson created the place settings, and menus. Fun, tattoo inspired day of the dead art. I will go back if I have friends looking for a nice dining experience with decent Mexican cuisine. But being a local, I'll keep looking for that place I will fall in love with. Thank you Craig for the opportunity!"}
{"text":"Very misleading on their taco Tuesday deal. Food was not good, service sucked. Rude ass staff. Took 30 minutes to bring 2 shots & 2 margaritas. Anorexic manager is just as rude as staff. & the waitress didn't give me back the correct amount of change. Definitely do not recommend. Save your money & go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ate here twice.  Food tastes good.  Chips and Salsa really good, good value on happy hour items. Mahi mahi tasted frozen but was a good piece of white meat and tasted fine.  Rice and beans were good flavor."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my wife on the 4th of July, and from the name, I expected some good MEX food.  However, for those that know what real Mexican food tastes like, this place doesn't even come close.  Everything is salty as hell, from the free chips to the stale (small and expensive) shrimp tacos.  I come to this casino a lot, and have always wanted to try the food in this restaurant because of all of the reviews.  However and unfortunately, the food is nothing Close to what can be called authentic.  Not to mention the $$$$.  Definitely a tourist trap."}
{"text":"If I could I'd give them a 10 star rating. I think I've found my favorite Mexican restaurant here in Vegas/Henderson and I live like 4 minutes away! It's a more upscale kind of restaurant inside of the casino. Hostesses were very nice and our waitress Ashley was really good. I had the carne asada tacos with beans and rice, my mom had the chicken nachos and her boyfriend had some kind burrito. Salsa was spot on both the normal one and the hottest one they had. I found my spot for Mexican food and oh the prices are awesome. They have happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment is an understatement. Other than the nice, friendly service, the food, wait time, quantity, etc, was not impressive, at all!! We arrived around 6:45 and around 8 were seated, although we noticed a few open tables throughout that hour and change wait. Perhaps they were understaffed and couldn't fill all tables? We sat at the bar and had a couple drinks, the bartender was very nice.  Once we were seated our waitress came by, took drink orders and delivered the drinks promptly, but disappeared again for 15 minutes. We were starving and so the wait seemed even longer. They delivered chips and salsa, but fajitas and healthier options are why we came, so avoiding overeating chips proved difficult. Finally the waitress returns, took orders and again, after a long wait our food arrived. As previously noted, we were starving, and so you'd think we'd devour our meals. They were not terrible, but pretty poor in flavor. My husband also commented he felt like the servings were on the small side. My daughter ordered shrimp fajitas and was disappointed that hers had so little shrimp.   The bill for 3 meals and 2 cocktails was around $90, minus tip.  We were so hopeful have a New Mexican place to stop by frequently, but I would not return of asked."}
{"text":"This is one of the best happy hour spots in Green Valley. Drinks are $6 and carne asada tacos $6!! Definitely great for happy hour. We also had excellent service with Ashley!"}
{"text":"Great food, good drinks, small portions which is great for sharing or a small group. But the service was alright. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and shared them, and when they brought it out they kept placing it in the middle and letting the table clutter. It was hard to get ahold of our waitress and busers to help clean it up or ask for anything else for that matter. I would go back just for the food"}
{"text":"Cindy is the best bartender she made out experience so much fun. She was very attentive and the drinks where amazing"}
{"text":"Just straight loved the place. Food is off the hook and service was great. Check in and get a free Margarita."}
{"text":"Horrible! Took over an hour to be seated then waited 30 mins at least for food and left before food ever got to table. We waited as dirty tables sat there for while not cleaned. First time there and we won't be back.  Told manager and he just said it was a busy night. Bad service."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Enjoyed margarita's and fresh corn salad, chicken tacos happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Great service and really great food. Didn't expect this at the GVR but what good change from the norm. Our server was excellent and it was easy to put your name in and get seated. We will be back!"}
{"text":"A nice new place in the district. They have a good happy hour menu with $6 margaritas. Yelp also offered a free margarita, but I decided to save that for later since it was $6 margarita time. The margarita was very tasty too. Their plates and decorations are nice. I kept staring at the walls and all over for the next cool design. Service was great and appetizer food was yummy. We had tacos and empanadas. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Have had dinner here many times and love the food and service. They also have the best looking and nicest bartenders in town."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times .. I've always had a great time dining ! Today was my first time at the bar , I usually go in and have a table with friends or family but I wanted to try something different today. Walking in, everyone is always friendly ! The hostess are always upbeat and ready for us. I walked into the bar tonight and had a drink, and pork carnitas ! They were amazing! The meat was soft and the flavor was killer ! I would definitely get it again, for sure one of my new favorites . The chips and salsa are also super great, I always ask for them when I go! It's a great and fast pace environment , the music is always good. It fits the place very well. Rob is a great bartender ! He's always making sure everyone is happy with what they have and keeps them coming !  He makes sure that he talks to you and does more than just makes the drinks, he makes great conversation !  I'll definitely be back here soon."}
{"text":"Ashley our waitress was the best! She is very attentive, great smiles, and very accommodating with everything we asked for. She is super! Food was awesome and very fresh. Great thing for Green Valley Resort. Very happy this place exists!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Green Valley Ranch, our server Hayley was phenomenal. We came in on a Sunday for brunch and they even had specials for the football games! Will be returning again soon :)"}
{"text":"Let's hope this one sticks. Borracha occupies the space that once held not one but two different Irish pubs. One served food, one didn't, both closed. Borracha is fantastic. Stop by on Tuesday for Taco Tuesday, they have an all you can eat and drink taco special (I think I had 9, I lost count after the 3rd or 4th margarita). The service is spectacular. So if you are at GVR, stop in and enjoy a delightful meal! Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"We sit at the bar gambling and relaxing. Their Margaritas are quite sophisticated in that there are flavor nuances that are present, as opposed to those sweet Marg types. Service of course is stellar. Efficient workers.   Its located in Green Valley Rach Casino. Gambling is Stations. Never had a chance to try the food, but judging from the patrons and size of the dishes, it must be above standard and large servings."}
{"text":"I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. After hearing about the Cinco de Mayo fiasco and reading reviews on Yelp I had the lowest of expectations for this restaurant. I love going to GVR and especially eating in this area so I decided to give them a try anyways. It was also restaurant week so that increased my motivation to give them a try.  I made a reservation since there aren't many tables and I've seen how busy they get in the evenings. We were seated soon after checking in for our reservation by a friendly hostess that thanked us for waiting. We checked out the regular menu and the restaurant week menu and opted to go with the restaurant week menu.   Our waitress was friendly and provided great service. She was on top of making sure we were taken care of and courses were brought out in a timely fashion. There were also a couple of employees constantly refilling drinks and clearing dirty plates. The service was very smooth.  We started with Mini Crab Ceviche Tacos and Beef Empanadas. The Beef Empanadas were really good and the pastry was buttery and flaky. The beef filling inside was tasty. The Mini Crab Ceviche Tacos was okay, but not the best item we had at Borracha so I wouldn't order it again. We were also given chips and salsa to start that were good.  I had the Chicken Loco which was a large portion of chicken covered in a tomatillo salsa and queso. It was simple, but really good. The portion provided enough to bring home half for leftovers. I also ordered a side of Mexican Street Corn. The flavor was great, but it was crazy on the salt. So crazy on the salt that I'm thinking it may have been a kitchen mishap. I'll definitely have to order this again and see if it was a one off because the flavor under the salt was so great. My husband had the Chicken Enchilada which had a red enchilada sauce on top that had a nice amount of smoke and spice flavors.  For dessert I went a little crazy and ordered Frosted Flake Rice Pudding. I loved it! The rice was tender and the flavor from the coconut and condensed milk was so yummy. The Frosted Flake Crunch was a great addition to the already great dessert. My husband had the Mini Churro Ice Cream which was an ice cream sandwich. The churro sandwich was yummy, but it was a little hard to eat. My dessert was definitely the winner between the two.  The Restaurant Week Menu made the meal a nice deal. The regular menu looked to be a bit on the pricey side, but being inside of GVR this is to be expected. We'll definitely return since the food and service exceeded our expectations."}
{"text":"Great place for Mexican food,  the chips are hot and fresh.  The salsa it really amazing great flavor. Star was a super great server. She made great recommendations and was very attentive, definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Great place! Good drinks and excellent food! Angie was our server and she was awesome! She was very knowledgeable with the menu and gave great recommendations! Loved the happy hour lobster tacos and big $6 margarita. I will be coming again!"}
{"text":"Drinks are Fabulous!!! One of my favorite margarita spots. Chips and salsa are a must but their entrees are mediocre."}
{"text":"This place is trendy looking/feeling and the food is actually really good.  Good food and drinks, for reasonable prices.   On Tuesdays they do all you can drink tequila shots and margaritas (with sauza reposado) and all you can eat tacos for $24. GREAT VALUE, the drinks are good but the tacos for this specials are no bueno... kind of dog food tasting, which is really surprising because the food on the normal menu is delicious.  Can't hurt to try this place out."}
{"text":"Amazing time! Great happy hour!!! Download the happy hour app as well to find your best happy hours around our area!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here for a quick bite to eat at the bar!  The staff is always super attentive and the food is delicious!  We are currently doing low carb so we asked if they could do the chicken tacos in a jicama shell instead of tortilla and they did!  Honestly tastes better and gives an extra crunch.  We always look forward to coming here!"}
{"text":"My friends and I LOVE Taco Tuesday!!! You can't beat the bottomless tequila/margs/beer/taco special and I always have to get the guac, it's great and comes out SUPER fast! We went last night with 20 people celebrating 3 birthdays and had a blast! Thank you to the great servers and management!"}
{"text":"We've been to Borracha many times and have always been very satisfied. We went today and ordered two glasses of house Chardonnay, the price....$28.00. Wha?? Happy hour only from here on out, if at all. My food was fine, street tacos. My wife's corn salad was not what it used to be. The poirtion has gotten smaller. The gauc.....tasteless. Order the bean and cheese dip instead.  Desert......tasty, but small portions.  Have they changed management?"}
{"text":"Triple threat. Best tacos, margaritas, and service we've had in a while! Our two bartenders \"Twink and Bear\" (LOL) were so awesome, thank you for making our date night perfect! We don't get a whole lot of them with a toddler at home, so that made tonight even better, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here on taco Tuesday! Sat down at the bar and had some amazing drinks and tacos!!  The guacamole was the best I had in town! Can't wait to go back for taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had a ton of fun at this place! We came after a banquet and remembered the old Irish bar that occupied this location before. Despite my initial realization my Irish bar is gone, I am happy to say it's replaced with a super fun Mexican bar.  I had a good chuckle at the name, Spanish for drunk.  Despite the tables all being full, we grabbed a seat at the bar waiting for seating. Hector was our bartender. He was quick to serve us, and made a solid drink: we had gin and tonic, draft brew and a margarita.  When we were finally seated James our server helped us out. He was truly fantastic, and had the right amount of spunk and helpful attitude. We had chips and guac, margaritas and fajitas. All very good, large portions and would recommend it.  Not sure why everyone else didn't like it, I would come again and would recommend it."}
{"text":"We started with the chicken tostadas and mini crab ceviche tacos.  The tostadas were really good however the mini crab tacos were made with imitation crab not real crab which was sad...the positive, our server Skyy was nice enough to offer to exchange it for something else so we decided to try the dynamite shrimp tacos...that is AWESOME customer care/satisfaction...  The Dynamite shrimp tacos....OFF THE HOOK...yes big time...they come in a Jicama shell, the batter on the shrimp was like a tempura batter and the taste of all the flavor, wow is all I can say and are something you definitely need to try...OMG  For the main course we ordered the chicken/steak fajitas.... First off it does not come with guacamole which is odd but ok, we ordered a side of the guacamole and it was ok, I've had better tasting guacamole.  It was missing seasoning it seemed like to me.  The fajitas were good, the steak was good, I asked for it medium rare and it came out medium but oh well it was still good.  The chicken was good though.  Overall it was a very nice place with amazing food and an even more impressive staff from the hostess counter all the way up to the manager, customer satisfaction is their priority.  We will be back and I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great!! Everything was fantastic. We asked for Ashley the server because last time we came she really took great care of us.  Again... the best!  Ashley remembered us and even remembered what we liked to eat!  She always delivered the food and drinks with s smile.  It's nice to accompany great food with great service.   The hostesses again were very welcoming and polite.  The bussers were on top of every dirty dish.   We finished our meal with an invitation to return from Ashley. Yes! We will be back. What a great date night.  Thank you Borracha!"}
{"text":"Go Knights Go! A group of friends and I came here to watch the game since they had some specials going on. If you wear vgk gear you get one free draft beer and free shots of tequila for any goals. They have multiple TVs throughout the restaurant so there's really not a bad spot in the house.  For the food we started with the complementary chips and salsa. I always judge a Mexican restaurant by their salsa and theirs was very good. For an entree I had the Crispy Dynamite Shrimp Tacos which were absolutely amazing. The shrimp was crispy and flavorful and I really enjoyed the jicama shell.   This place was so fun and high energy and sever was really friendly and on point with keeping our shots flowing. I will definitely be back again for a game and probably just for a normal dinner as well. Worth the 30 min drive for me."}
{"text":"We went for dinner here last night.  AWESOME!   On Tuesdays they do 25 dollar all you can eat tacos and drink tequila !   I was kinda bummed to hear it was only chicken and steak tacos (I wanted the al pastor so bad) - the chicken are okay but the steak are (fire)  - but honestly by the time I was done eating I was so happy it didn't even matter ! Our server was James.  He was also great.  I'm overly picky and critical of service since I'm a bartender.   For the first time in so long I had NO complaints ! They even changed the tvs for us so we could watch the game we wanted.  PERFECT.  I wonder if they have football specials ? I'm going back next Tuesday.   Definatly worth it.   Take a lyft, the cocktails are strong ;)"}
{"text":"Really REALLY enjoyed this place!  The atmosphere is fun and hip.  Huge Tequila selection and margarita selection. I'm from Texas originally and have been on a search the past 6.5 years in Vegas to find a good Tres Leche..... this place hands down wins!!!   The crispy dynamite shrimp app was amazing. LOVED the Jicama shell.  Made the tacos so refreshing and different.   The service was amazing and on point!   We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Last night of \" restaurant weeks\" in our city so we decided to have dinner here after the movie. The drinks were awesome, the service over the top. Wish I knew the name of our server, we have had him before and really must love what he does because he always take really great care of us. We had a nice booth, the place was packed and full of high energy. The food on the other hand was a mixed bag. The tostada salad and tequila fajitas were very good. The cheese appetizer and the chili relleno were not so good. Dessert of fried ice cream was a nice ending touch. Wish it had tasted better because for the value ( $ 30.00) per person , how could you lose.  Borracha is a fun place, not the most authentic Mexican food, but very tasty. Ciao"}
{"text":"The carne asada was soo good! My boyfriend wasn't a fan of their street tacos but that carne asada will get me to go back it was delicious. My free margarita for checking in was also good."}
{"text":"This place was okay. Basically the place was nice and the service but the foods is ok. I ordered a garlic shrimp but I didn't taste the garlic. It was teally bad, garlic shrimp supposed to be garlic and shrimp only no veggies and to much broth. The side of rice it's kind a uncooked not really authenticity spanish rice its a version. My fiance he order grilled shrimp but we never see any grilled marked its just the same taste and flavor of garlic shrimp. My brother inlaw and niece their side of beans is to salty and  uncooked rice. We definitely not going back this place because the foods was horribleness.  The reason I have 2 star because the service isn't bad indeed!!"}
{"text":"Waiter at the bar seemed annoyed when I asked about 2 for 1 special. But food was great!!"}
{"text":"Margaritas and chips & salsa were decent, but the entrees were horrible!  Kids had nachos and they tasted like salty macaroni cheese.  My chicken tacos tasted like salty sour cream.  And my wife didn't like her salad.  We thought we'd try since reviews were high,but would not recommend. Definitely a casino trap!"}
{"text":"If you've never been here before...what are you waiting for?! Incredible food, trendy ambience & kind servers. My group and I shared the Bubbling Cheese Fundido to start, which I would recommend to cheese lovers everywhere. Definitely mouth watering & the bits of chorizo are a perfect addition! For my entree I chose the Crispy Dynamite Shrimp Tacos and OMG. The jicama shell really highlights the explosion of flavor when biting into the coconut shrimp and sauces. Mentioning sauces....I could bathe in the avocado cream sauce-DELICIOUS! My mother ordered the Steak Fajitas (which I shamelessly stole a bite of), great portion and perfectly cooked. My grandma ordered the Beef Enchiladas-another hit! For dessert, we shared the Flan. Super smooth and just the right amount of sweet. I was also pleasantly surprised by the kiwi and strawberries on top-a nice pop of color! 5/5 stars, I will be back-again & again! Thank you Borracha! :)"}
{"text":"Late Valentine's day date night we decided to stop here first. The food and drinks were delicious. Absolutely loved the salsa! Working in the service industry myself it looked a little under staffed, but we never got the feeling it was. The service was absolutely great from the bartenders Rob and Steve.   Very curious to try out the Tuesday tacos and tequila, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"James was our server tonight and we could not ask for better service! Great customer service skills and made us feel welcomed. We will definitely be coming back and asking for him again! Thank you so much for the hospitality and tequila!"}
{"text":"Worst service of any restaurant I've ever been to in Las Vegas/Henderson and I have lived here my entire life. Salsa was great but everything else was mediocre at best. I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Loved the food choices there and even went back the second night bc I felt I missed some foods I missed the first night! Yum!!! And they have great servers!!"}
{"text":"This place was good.  A lil pricey but the food is very good.  Had the skirt steak and it was awesome. I will more than likely go back....beer list is kinda lacking."}
{"text":"I pretty much had given up on Mexican food, but Borracha has made me excited for taco Tuesday, carnitas and even for their chips and salsa. The roasted corn salad was Devine, the salsa was fresh and perfectly seasoned... not too spicy! The menu was simple, but the flavors were deep and sophisticated. Kudos to the chef and thank you to the great staff for 5 star service."}
{"text":"It was nice place to watch Golden Knights game. If you wear VGK gear, you get free draft beer, 50% off Taco plate, and tequila shots every score. The server was great and seats were comfortable. Taco wasn't good and traditional flan was too sweet for me. Next time I want to try something else."}
{"text":"We found the noise level to be very high with music blasting and loud talking.  The usual bowl of chips with a tasty house made salsa arrived shortly after being seated. The roasted corn salad described as grilled corn, cotija and panela cheeses, cherry tomatoes, red pepper, pickled red onion, jicama and cotija cheese vinaigrette looked mouth watering on the menu, but the portion size was minuscule, the cotija cheese was limited to a few small cubes and the corn must have come directly out of a freezer bag with no time spent on a grill.   We fared much better with our entrees with my wife choosing the chili relleno and me the slow roasted pork carnitas. The carnitas were different than I have experienced previously in that it was not shredded, but the meat proved to be both tender and delicious. The accompanying Spanish rice though was beyond blah and largely ignored. My wife's chili relleno did not live up to the description though still okay.  Alicia, our server, seemed disengaged. It being senior day, I was only charged 1/2 points."}
{"text":"Upscale Mexican food in a very nice environment. Servers were attentive and helpful. Ordered the enchiladas and chips and salsa. Reasonably priced for the ambiance. Would recommend for dates and having drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Ok, being from New York, the pricing was fine.   17-22 per plate we ordered.   They come out with free chips and salsa.   The chips were excellent and the sauce, I mean salsa was good.   It was a little on the low low scale for spiciness, so it could have doubled as pizza sauce.   Our appetizer was the loaded chicken nachos.   Good dish but chicken was a little on the dry side.   Dinner - I ordered the chili relleno.  The flavors were good, just not together.  The poblano pepper was a little spicier than most.   I would not get this dish again, nor would I tell someone not to get it.   My wife had the slow roasted pork carnitas, and whereas the flavors worked, the fat to meat ratio was 1:1.   We did get a drink each, and pricing was fine.  Margarita was not watered down.   I would not do this again as a meal option.   I might stop in for a drink if I were already in the casino."}
{"text":"Have loved this place in the past but tonight was a HUGE let down.  The service was so slow all night.  We've been waiting for our change from our bill for the last 45 minutes. Appetizers came out before water or margaritas.  Soup was brought to the table without a spoon.  We had to wait another ten minutes for a spoon.  With as long as everything took tonight you would think the place was packed....but it wasn't.  I'm not sure we will be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"I had such an amazing time at Borrachas happy hour. Our server Hailey made sure we were well taken care of. Will definitely come again! Thank you Hello Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Came here on a date night with the hubby. The drinks where on par and the alcohol in them was legit. The salsa and chips tasted good. We really enjoyed our experience here. See you soon!"}
{"text":"SO good! Fun place and awesome food. The dynamite tacos and the Pablo Chacon margarita were delicious! Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Definitely try the tres leches cake and the dynamite shrimp tacos. Delicious! Service was amazing as well. If possible, request Nick as your waiter. He's great and will definitely take great care of you!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour food.  Been here twice and very consistent.  Good service and food quality.  Have tried everything on the happy menu and was very good.  House margs are fresh with hornitos, lime and agave nectar. Do recommend if you are staying at Green Valley Ranch."}
{"text":"Bueno, Bueno, Bueno!   The bartenders are creative & super friendly. I  suggest ordering the bean dip, its G O O D!  On Tuesday...$24 for all you can eat tacos and tequila. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I showed up around 6pm on a Saturday and was greeted by a very polite host. Was told the wait would be 15 minutes which we didn't mind waiting, was surprised that we got a text less than 5 mins later saying our table was ready. Atmosphere was very open with plenty of TVs and the center bar being the main focal point.   Our chips and salsa arrived right away. Chips were warm and the salsa was thick and tasted great. We ordered the guacamole for an extra $8 and though it was good, we both thought it tasted kind of plain, nothing special and wouldn't order it again. I ordered the al pastor street tacos. They were okay, 3 decent sized tacos and flavor was mediocre but again, I was left looking for something more (I prefer the al pastor at other places on Eastern Ave). My girl ordered the chicken Tostitos with a side of rice and beans and they tasted amazing. Crispy shells and the meat was very moist. Bill came to $41 for two people without alcohol. Overall the atmosphere was fun and the food was above average but not spectacular. I would come again."}
{"text":"Reverse happy hour...I am not sure why this place isn't packed! Chips and salsa were perfect.  Warm chips.  Salsa was top 5 I've ever had.  Cheese quesadilla and chicken nachos for $12!!  Can't beat it! I would have gladly paid full price!"}
{"text":"Javier's !! Bravo  Incredible from start to finish ... sat at the bar... bartenders were great ... service was great ... food was fabulous ... love this place!"}
{"text":"Loved it!!! Had the carne asada burrito and Mexican street corn. Yummy. Warm chips and salsa. A pitcher of margarita was 45.00 and it served over 8 glasses. Well worth it. Servers were awesome and went out of their way for us. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went last night and really enjoyed all of the food. Started with the guac and dynamite shrimp and they were both delicious. Complimentary chips and salsa were also great. For dinner we had mahi tacos that were good and the chicken loco that was so good! The tomatillo sauce was amazing and the sweet corn was great too. Our server Hailey was really good at describing the dishes and didn't give the generic, \"oh that's good\" response. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have always loved the District in Las Vegas. What has been especially cool is that the District doesn't hold on to Venue's once their time has passed. Growing up in Henderson I have seen many businesses pass through Green Valley Ranch and the District-- each one fits the times and is usually replaced by a newer and better concept.  Borracha replaced Quinn's which many of my friends were sad about. However, Borracha is super cool. The ceilings are paneled by wood and the decor is a warm and inviting With what looks like hand-drawn murals on the walls.   It was a Sunday when I arrived at Borracha with 6 friends. We enjoyed the scenery and some Sunday football, but we were literally the only people in there. How am I supposed to judge the service when the place is barren?   The Guacamole and margaritas were good but quite expensive. I wonder what the experience is like on a packed day? instagram: @glowrae"}
{"text":"Food was okay but I wan't impressed.. I thought they were a little overpriced. The chicken quesadilla was a good size, but super greasy...the ceviche tacos were yummy. The Mexican corn was disappointing."}
{"text":"Star is the best server!!! We adore her and I couldn't have had a better person host my 40th!!"}
{"text":"Great margaritas! I would like to come back for a taco Tuesday to see how the tacos are.  I enjoyed the chips and salsa, and for my meal I ordered just a bean and cheese burrito wet (with red sauce and cheese melted on top) the burrito itself was rather small. It seemed as if they used a giant tortilla and not a lot of beans and cheese because to cut into the burrito was a task... through all the layers of tortilla folds. It was served alongside beans and rice which I found odd. I have never been served a burrito with beans and rice on the side. But still ok. The beans were good, and the rice was ok. A tad bit undercooked. The red sauce was pretty good, can't say it was the worst, can't say it was my favorite. All over mediocre meal... and my whole dining party agreed. The food was good but mediocre.  I would give this place another shot just to have another margarita. I think it was the best margarita I've ever had! So I'll be back!  It's worth a try"}
{"text":"I visited this establishment a Tuesday night during their all you can eat tacos and all you can drink margarita special. I came here with a large group. I highly recommend making a reservation if you plan to attend during this special. We did make a reservation and we were able to get seated, but the place was completely full.   The majority of the people on my table ordered the special. I ordered their shrimp ceviche and sangria. The ceviche came with plantain chips and the flavor was pretty good. It was a tad too lemony but I still enjoyed eating it. Even though this is an appetizer plate, I thought the portion was good for one person as a full meal. The sangria I ordered though, was not amazing. I shared a pitcher with a friend and she was not loving it. The flavor was too sweet and aside from some fruit given in the glass, there wasn't anything else.  Everyone else on the table that ordered the special seemed to enjoy their tacos and margaritas. Unless you are someone that eats a lot, I am not sure if you are getting your moneys worth. Mostly everyone on my table ate about 3 tacos, and you could order those separate and pay less.   Overall, great atmosphere. We did receive good service."}
{"text":"Salsa is delicious, staff is great $8 Pitchers of beer are great value Kids menu at $5 is also great value but when they charge additional $4 for lemonade that kindof kills the value of the kids meal. Kids meal could also use 1or 2 additional options. Tacos plates and enchiladas with rice and beans were very good. Seriously $4 for a kids lemonade and $8 for a pitcher of beer. Unfortunately the kids drink prices were not published and when I got the bill I asked him to make sure $4 was the right price; he said yes and apologized."}
{"text":"Gave them a try and was very pleased. Service was spot on and the timing between courses was perfect. Their salsa was the best we've had in years and the Happy Hour Margaritas, delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing chips and salsa! With flavor but not overly spicy. The steer tacos were also wonderful! I had one of each.  Drinks were refreshing! Great ambiance."}
{"text":"If you want over priced American Mexican food it isn't bad. Very limited menu and probably the worst fried ice cream I have ever had.  I wouldn't waste your time with this place unless you enjoy eating chips and salsa.  Great service just over priced American Mexican food."}
{"text":"New hot place in Henderson for sure. Located in the Green Valley Ranch Resort which is one of my favorite places in Henderson.   I've only called in for reservations. I would recommend this instead of waiting on a table for now as it's a newer restaurant in the area. Seems like the wait can be long right now. One thing to consider when calling is MAKE SURE YOU CALL THE RIGHT Borracha. Some friends of mine called the wrong one and made reservations which obviously threw a twist in their night.  The food is great. The street tacos is the way to go. Also, they have very unique and custom Margaritas that you can't get anywhere else.   The service has always been great to me. I've never felt at Borracha that the service could be better.  Highly recommended. Now that I think about it I may head there now."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Great drinks. Our waitress was attentive and the environment was welcoming. Recommend the fish bowl margarita."}
{"text":"Great deal on Tuesdays and love the atmosphere! Only negative would be that it's in gvr- would love for borrachas to have a free standing restaurant!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! They have amazing service, the food is delicious (especially the Mexican corn!!) and the drinks are perfect. I've come here with my boyfriend 3-4 times and we will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Wife and I play craps and this cantina has a view of the craps tables, so you can observe if the tables are up or down... and sip on some great margaritas while you wait.  The margaritas are very good, but so is the food and the service.  Borracha is one of our favorite casino cantinas that bolsters the fun!"}
{"text":"Awesome service hands down and the margaritas were soooo good!!! Server was so attentive and the food was super yummy! Highly recommend the coconut shrimp tacos appetizers."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere but worst service ever!  Sky ruined a perfectly good experience and my husband was so upset he wanted to leave no tip.  We couldn't even get someone's attention to voice concerns.  My husband went back of the house to get his own soda.  If you dare go here the fish tacos were great ."}
{"text":"Awesome Margaritas and great food. The bartender  Kelsey makes the best margaritas, super refreshing. Hip atmosphere. Definitely will be back for their happy hour"}
{"text":"I had great hopes for this place the food was mediocre but that's probably because I'm used to authentic home cooked Mexican food the atmosphere was very nice, only thing they don't have a blender so no blended margaritas or pina colada :( we had a pinche pina which was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"The salsa is good, that's about it. 3rd time here and definitely not the charm. First two times it was just ok. Third time was really bad. Food was way to salty. Menu is pretty small and food came very fast which made me feel like it was pre-cooked. Not going back."}
{"text":"The food doesn't have much flavor. The service wasn't great either. The hostess was very unfriendly and seemed think we were bothering her. Put server told us it was half point Wednesday yet didn't give us the offer. Charged us full points on our account. I would not go back or recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night around 530pm. Our waiter Dylan was great! He kept our drinks filled and was prompt in  getting whatever we asked for. I got a carne asada burrito which came with rice and beans. The rice was meh, but I'm not a big rice person. The beans were decent but the steak was yummy. It was nicely seasoned and had good grill flavor. One of the people I dined with had ordered a chicken quesadilla and just got a cheese one. It was brought to Dylan's attention and he quickly fixed it by giving her a chicken quesadilla to go home! We ended the meal with flan for dessert and it was delish!! I will try the churro ice cream sandwich next time!!"}
{"text":"We had a fabulous evening. The food is fresh. The salsa is to die for. But without a doubt the best waiter/service ever. He even went to a restaurant next door to get us some butter. Reheated a dish we hadn't started, due to chatting over yummy house margaritas. Don't be fooled by the casino location. I'll be back."}
{"text":"If you're in the area or perhaps your testing your luck at the casino itself then you definitely need to check Borracha out! Oh and so yourself a favor and ask for Hailey as your server! I can't remember the last time the service somewhere stood out like it did tonight. I decided to try the Portabello tacos and they're Vegan. Everything on the plate from the cheese to the \"Spanish\" rice to the beans and lastly the tacos are VEGAN! So step out your boundaries and give it a try so stick to your usual Mexican favorites. It's always a winning meal here the 3 plus times I've been here! Oh and another win is the feee margarita with a check in for those of you who drink! I have to comment on the gorgeous decor too."}
{"text":"This place has a good ambiance.  The blood orange margarita was fabulous but the food not so great.  I had the salmon that came with rice and cole slaw, rice was dry and hard, the rice at pollo loco is better and the slaw was dry with no dressing or very little.  We also got some guacamole which was bland but ok.  I'm going to give this place another chance hopefully the other dishes are better.  If your looking for good margaritas come here but I would think twice about having dinner here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Everyone is super nice and easy to talk to. The staff is very knowledgeable about the menu and gave us great tips on what to order. My girlfriend and I will be here at least once a week for food and drinks!! Highly recommend this place!!! 5 Stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"In the interest of Yelp integrity, I will declare up-front that I work for the hospitality group at the helm of this operation. As a California native, Mexican food is a main staple for me. Here's what I think is worth mentioning: Flaky crispy taco shells and crab ceviche. In all honesty, this place is worth a visit for those seeking a gourmet Mexican experience."}
{"text":"This is my second visit. This restaurant had a HUGE improvement since the last time I came. I have to admit that they provided an AMAZING service. The food was from heaven specially the Cheese Fundido. Mary, the manager was really nice and welcoming. Make sure you have reservation. This place is getting  so good that people start to notice. CONGRATULATIONS LA BORRACHA"}
{"text":"10 STARS!   Great food, great service, great atmosphere, great price.   Tuesdays is unlimited tacos & tequila for $24! YES PLEASE.   Star was our server and she was amazing, so amazing.. We had about a million different checks and she handled it so fast and great.   Will return VERY soon. Great for groups."}
{"text":"Great location! Food was simple  Happy hour great Can use coupon that station casino mails out for players."}
{"text":"What else to say but a perfect night for our anniversary dinner. Had a passion fruit margarita with real purée and a chili garnish that was arranged like Devils horns haha... The quesadilla I got was out of this world with perfect spices inside (almost like a blackening spice), and the service by Waitress Skyy was on point, with giving great advice on the menu, checking in often to see if we were okay, boxing up the left overs and just acting like she gave a crap about her job. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Wow what a find and who would imagine that it is in the casino ! I really must say I believe this to be one of the top five Mexican restaurants in Ca, Az & Nv !  (#1 for taste and quality of food )  I had the  carnitas plate, which was tender and delicious ! This was genuine slow roasted pork, not something heated from a frozen food service package. Very juicy and the flavor was outstanding!!  They have great food and drink specials also, seems to be something for everyone's taste here.  My only criticism is the house margaritas, which were very good, made with fresh lime juice, again not packaged mix, were a bit tart for my taste, but easily fixed with a shot of Grand Marnier!  Don't miss this restaurant if you love genuine Mexican food prepared by a chef that knows the business!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! I'd definitely recommend the chicken brown rice bowl  good portion size and amazing mixture of flavors!"}
{"text":"At Borracha right now and the margaritas are yo die for. Rob the bartender is very friendly and attentive. This place is a must go to. Sit at the bar and enjoy the drinks and the atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place !! I came for a nice dinner with my mom and we both had an excellent experience. We were immediately sat at a nice booth and promptly greeted by our server who made sure we were happy throughout the whole night."}
{"text":"First time for dinner. We are locals and usually don't eat in the casinos but this was probably the best Mexican restaurant in all of Henderson. We had the carne asada, fajitas and salad. The steak/meat was tender, very well seasoned and tasted amazing. The sides were also very good and that's hard to do with rice and beans but both were tasty and not dry like other places. It's a great deal for the money and of course the margaritas are very good and they don't skimp on the tequila. I would recommend this place for families and even a date night. The service was also exceptional. They are very attentive."}
{"text":"Going out is a treat for my husband and I. The beginning started off well with the interaction with the hostess's. We made a reservation and were sat immediately. After that it was all down hill. Our server skky was horrible!!!   -forgot our water -forgot our straws -took our menus but forgot to take our orders -when we asked for silverware, dessert menu etc. she would NEVER come back with it  Food-ok but not worth the prices. Happy hour maybe, but dinner, never again!"}
{"text":"4 stars only for the carnitas.  Killer!!! Everything else is just ok.   We ordered a bunch of different things and nothing wowed us.  But let me tell you.   If you want delicious.   Stick with the carnitas.  You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! If you go on Tuesday you get all you can eat tacos and tequila for $25 it's an awesome deal!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant and staff. Have always had an excellent experience here. Ask the manager Yohan to enlighten your knowledge and taste to the many tequila offerings."}
{"text":"What a a disappointment for such a cool Mexican inspired place that aside from its \"Day of the Dead\" inspired decor and lively bar really left a very bad impression.  There was no wait time when we arrived.  We asked for a booth and were told there was none available.  After had sat someone came and told us they did have a booth and they just needed to clean it up.  After almost 10minutes of waiting for a booth, we were sat.  Nice table where we could see the entire restaurant. Waiters and waitresses were very inexperienced and the entire place seemed in havoc (understandably as it was less than a week since they had opened).  The salsa was good, chips were not authentic and had an after taste.  I ordered the Chicken Rice bowl and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Fajitas and I also ordered the tortilla soup.  Food not good.  The soup was more a chili based than a tomato based soup and it was a purée instead of a nice broth, they paired it with a store bought flour tortilla instead of hand made that came with Fajitas.  Odd and inconsistent.  Rice bowl is horrible, unless you like almost 2 full cups of rice with less than a 1/4 oz of boiled chicken grazed sparingly with some black beans.  No veggies or even lettuce to add variety and crunch to the meal. The Fajitas are expensive for what you get.  Best thing about that dish was the flour tortilla.   Nice decor, cool bar but over hyped and bad service, bad first impression.  Hope it's a rough opening.  I would hesitate to return."}
{"text":"I love the salsa here. If you check in on yelp and show the server you get a free Margarita too. I very much enjoyed the carnitas and the street corn which they do off the cobb. It tends to get pretty busy here too there is usually a wait."}
{"text":"Ate here the night of 4th of July, our party was large, had reservations, took up half the restaurant, they weren't ready for us so they scrambled to set up more tables and chairs. We didn't wait too long for drinks but our food took awhile to get, our party organizer said she told them to have food ready for us at 6:30 when we arrived but it wasn't. Then when food started coming out, there was no room on the table, there was so much, some tables hardly got anything so we shared as much as we could. The staff was polite and apologetic and tried their best to keep us happy. The food was good, I felt like the pork and steak were the way to go, chicken was dry. House Margarita's were good too. I would go back and give it a try on our own if given the opportunity."}
{"text":"prices were a little steep (but it's in a casino) so we rolled with it thinking the food would be pretty good.....it's not. This is more of a bar that just so happens to sell tacos. Not very good at all. I had an el pastor burrito (very dry) and my husband had steak fajitas (very bland). There salsa could have used more lime to drown out the canned tomato flavor, and the guacamole was overpowering with garlic. The drinks were not bad and the atmosphere of the place was very up beat. This would be a pretty good hang out for drinks but as far as eating here I personally wouldn't suggest it."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. Their happy hour selection is wonderful  The service was phenomenal, and  Hayley was the best!"}
{"text":"Hey the food is pretty tasty and I will go there again. It serves a modern spin on traditional mexican food. Really fresh tasting ingredients but sometimes the \"spin\" was in a funny way. For example I ordered a tostada salad and although it was delicious and fresh it was not served in a tostado lol.  The \"street tacos\" do not perfectly reflect real street tacos   as the name would have you believe rather they are inspired by them. The meat had more of a slow cooker thing going on and had some flavors I did not recognize from usual street taco but I enjoyed them.  This modern and fresh spin probably serves the business very well considering it's location at the Green Valley Casino. Pretty cool vibe and friendly servers."}
{"text":"Gotta say, This is my favorite new place in my area! I am a frequent visitor of GVR... But there food selections are not my favorite.... Until now. I have been telling all my friends and fam to go there for any occasion. Not only is the food excellent with a great happy hour, and the house margarita is amazing... But the service is stellar. Twice I have had the pleasure of being waited on by Star, and she is extremely authentic and hospitable. So refreshing to see this because i feel that Vegas has gotten away from making this top priority. Cannot wait for NFL season to come back so I can watch all the Sunday Night games there. Highly Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So got the opportunity to eat here recently for a friend's birthday. I mean what says celebration like Mexican food and margaritas right? And according to my Latina friends Borracha translates to \"drunk girl\". Not sure if they were egging me on however I decided to take that as a challenge which I was glad to accept!  First off, I was really digging the whole Day of the Dead theme they had which did not stop at just the decor on the walls. It varied over to even our playing which I absolutely loved. They also had a nice open format with a really nice sized bar as well.  We had a large group of about 20 people and we were quickly seated. I always feel bad for the servers dealing with such a large group. Everyone is scattered and people want to have separate checks. The staff handled it very professionally and with ease. I was pleased to see their was a complimentary house margarita with check in which several people in our group took advantage of.  Now to the food! Nice menu with decent pricing for a casino so we were worried that the portions would be small. I'm thrilled to announce the portions were very generous. I ordered the carnitas which was juicy and flavorful. Im one of those people that actually loves leftovers and I get excited at times just thinking about it. I was pleased that my portion was generous and I had enough to have for lunch the next day with even enough to share!  I'm looking forward to coming back and exploring not only their other food items but some of their fun and inspired cocktails!  Everyone seemed to really enjoy their meal."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!! The happy hour was really good, margaritas were just right and my nachos were sooo good! My grandma had the tostadas and said they were so good. I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Borracha is a trendy Mexican cantina spot you wanna go to with your girlfriends or friends to have a fun time! We decided to go for Taco Tuesday for one of our girlfriends birthday.   We didn't know how the menu and Taco Tuesday went so we had to ask our server who was kind and attentive enough to explain. We did the margaritas and tacos and tried, shrimp, beef & chicken. They come out wrapped in foil so you don't know which is which until you open it up. We then kept getting more margaritas, which by the end they ended up giving us plastic cups since the ran out of the glass. Odd, but our server and my friends gave him the benefit of the doubt and just continued to have fun.   They have a live DJ on Taco Tuesday's which is also cool so you can enjoy and have a fun time with good company. Would go back again!"}
{"text":"Great place. The $24.00 all you can eat margaritas and tacos for taco Tuesday is everything!!! They bring you a dozen tacos at a time and take the leftovers home. Don't forget the free margarita for checking-in if your not there for taco Tuesday. They definitely don't water down the drinks. Staff is amazing"}
{"text":"First time here and this was a hopping place with the hockey game on several screens. The locals were going crazy! Dylan was a great server and the food was presented well and tasted great. I had a tostada and my wife the tacos (crispy). Good vibes and decent prices will definitely return when I'm in town."}
{"text":"We're locals and came in for taco Tuesday. Our server Hailey went above and beyond in explaining the menu and making us feel so welcome. The food was incredible and we couldn't believe how inexpensive it all was. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We came here for the Golden Knights playoff games, and boy did both not disappoint! We had the taco platter specials and a beer.  The carne asada, fish, and chicken tacos were awesome!  The flavors were fantastic and the service was on point.  The chips kept coming which made our daughter very happy.  The kids loved their quasdillia with chicken. I tasted it and it was very good.   A great mix of cheese and the chicken was plentiful for a kids meal."}
{"text":"Easy to see why none of the staff could get a job on the Strip; slow, inattentive, unprofessional and incapable. I noticed most positive reviews were written when the place first opened; that short-lived time is over. Seriously, the workers last night didn't even posess the basic skill sets to serve the 5 customers present, even though there were about 6 \"workers\" and a child-manager behind the bar. This restaurant, due to its location, must rely on locals to survive; it seems to be circling the drain right about now, which is no surprise in light of the terrible service we \"received\".  Ps- A Saturday night is not the time to fiqure out your draft beer system isn't working. You people are completely incompetent!"}
{"text":"This is a cool spot inside green valley ranch hotel and casino. Very upbeat place, nice interior, and amazing vibe. Servers were great. I think it's better to do reservations since they get packed pretty quick especially dinner time.  We went on taco Tuesday. $24 for unlimited chicken/beef tacos, margaritas and tequila shots. The tacos were good, very flavorful. Margarita was on a sweeter side. I would say it's worth it if you have a big appetite. The tacos were the regular size, not street tacos style.  We also ordered chips and salsa and guac. The guac was on point, very creamy which I love. Overall a great experience and I would totally be back to try the other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Woof... Store bought taco shells and janky salsa. I was not impressed. This is definitely \"white-mans Mexican food.\" Cute decor and nice folk working, but sheesh... The pollo was dry too. I'd rather come for drinks, not food."}
{"text":"This restaurant was fantastic. Everything we had tasted so incredibly fresh and delicious. I loved the salsa - wish I had the recipe!"}
{"text":"Very ok. The chips and salsa were the best part of the meal. We had to wait for a table and went to the bar. We all (4 of us) ordered $12 margaritas, paid and upon sitting at the table were told it was taco night and all you can eat tacos and margaritas were just $24+. Asked if our already purchased margaritas could apply we were told no. Kind of sketchy! I ordered the Taco special anyway, and only had one refill of my tacos and no refill of my margarita, had to ask a bus boy for more tacos. Oh well food was mediocre anyway so we wouldn't ever go back."}
{"text":"I was not very impressed with the food quality. I had the steak taco and the chicken taco. I didn't like either one. The chips were fantastic. The salsa was really good as well. However the dinner tacos were not good at all and I find it very hard to find a bad taco anywhere but I found two. MiGusto tacos down the street had much better tacos."}
{"text":"this place is awesome! their taco tuesday deal is one of the best in town. great atmosphere and very fun vibes. extensive selection of tequilas and specialty cocktails. thank you peter phat for making my experience great! i will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"Hayley helped us tonight.  I'm now on a low carb diet and she completely made the tacos in lettuce wraps!!! Wow!!! Awesome.  She's beautiful and extremely accommodating.  We will return."}
{"text":"Rob and Jesus is awesome bartendersss!!!! Great service! Great atmosphere! It's inside the casino. And they have great drink options."}
{"text":"New place at GVR but it has a really cool vibe! Be sure to grab a margarita at the bar from Rob ! Love the Dios vibe. Nifty place with an interesting menu. Check out the rice bowls."}
{"text":"Excellent place with outstanding service!   Ashley, our server, was amazing from start to finish.  She gave great recommendations off the menu and was around to check on us.  Amazing customer service!   The food was excellent.  Definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Bubbling cheese fundino yum!  Crab ceviche yum! Fajitas yum! Slow roasted pork yum! All the ingredients taste very fresh and the cocktails have an original flare.  Perfect service and you'll enjoy the surroundings!"}
{"text":"Definitely would recommend this place! If you're in the area, check this place out! You won't be disappointed! The salsa and guacamole is spectacular! My server, Alicia, was so wonderful, kind, and attentive to our needs! It's a very non-traditional Mexican restaurant but the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Sadly, this was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. Everything started reasonably well, as we thought the salsa was fresh and delicious and the waitress was extremely accommodating and friendly. We were a party of three vegetarians and immediately alerted the waitress. Ordered two plates of veggie tacos and one salad. We were glad that the waitress informed us that there was meat stock in the rice and beans, and she said the kitchen would substitute brown rice and black beans for us.   Unfortunately when the orders arrived, the sides of rice and beans were both the non-vegetarian options. We had to send the orders back to be fixed. When they came back out, we found that they still had not substituted the vegetarian rice for the sides. My friend and I started eating our tacos, and they were honestly inedible. The tortillas, which are usually a delicious highlight of tacos, tasted and felt like cardboard. The rice and beans were also extremely bland and stale. My friend had ordered hard taco shells and the waitress forgot to mention that they were cooked in the same oil that was used to fry the meat, so she substituted in soft tortillas without asking him. He described the tacos as \"the worst I've ever had\".   We felt terrible because most of the problems weren't the waitress' fault, but we had to say something about the horrible quality food. My friend got a substitute order of fajitas for no charge which he said was fair. We both thought that the margaritas were too sweet and syrupy-tasting; at least we got the free one! For the extremely high prices at this place, we definitely expected better service and food. Overall, our entire party was just soured by the bad experience here. Would NEVER recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I like the food so I keep trying it out but the service is ruining things. You'll wait for food, water refills, the check, the waitress to return with the check. Really!? Every time I'm disappointed. I wish they could get it together."}
{"text":"It's as if someone took Diablos or the old El Camino off the Strip and said let's put this in the Green Valley suburbs and charge the exact same Strip prices for about the same type of food. We had the tamale cakes, beef empanada, chicken rice bowl and chicken nachos (not during happy hour which I've heard is better) and it was just eh. Nothing to write home about. You're not going to remember it and nothing will stand out.  From a restaurant standpoint, the food is average, the service is slow and the set up of their two tops in between the booths and bigger tables is weird in a voyeur kind of way. I see what they are trying to do but again it seems to work for the Strip, which is exactly what it replicates, as opposed to GVR. With that being said, I still like the décor, the bar and the way it opens out to the casino. The little touches on the dishware and art do make it stand out. I think it is a really good place to grab some drinks, some chips and salsa and bring a little life back to GVR. However, I would have dinner next door at the Italian place or Hanks instead."}
{"text":"My favorite things:  The drinks (margaritas specifically. Mango AND blood orange. Not too sweet. Best ones I've had)  The crispy dynamite shrimp tacos  Ambiance: the wall art is pretty cool.   Service was great. Dylan was super attentive.   Definitely the best place to watch sports without the rowdy crowd and bar food.   Omg the dessert too. Tres leches and the churro ice cream sandwich thing.   Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Street tacos are not street tacos,  salsa is ok. Not a place for food but for football it rocDylan is the best server in the whole place! He needs a raise! And the manager Johann is the bomb! He is always on top of it and makes sure we are taken care of. Thank you for taking care of my USC family! Will be back next season."}
{"text":"If it were possible to go with 4.5 stars, I would. I'll start by saying there is a LOT of great things about this place! To start with, the food was awesome! definitely get the guac and have your hand at the chips and salsa. The entrees were well sized and tasted awesome! We had the chance to meet Trey, one of the managers. He demonstrated EXCELLENT customer service and was personable and attentive. The downsides for me which brought down the rating to a 4 (or 4.5 should I have the option) was the overall service from the wait staff (it was unreasonably slow at times) and also the price - for what you get, there is certainly a high price tag to it. Two drinks a piece, one guac app and two entrees left us close to $100 with the tip. Overall I would still go back!"}
{"text":"Here I am finding myself having more delicious Mexican food. I live about 7-10 mins away from Green Valley Ranch and I have been eyeing Borracha for awhile. I have been dying to try their taco Tuesday, I have yet to try it. I came in with my fiancé a couple days ago to grab and quickish lunch. Anytime you plan to sit and eat is not quick so don't be unrealistic if you want something NOW. But that wasn't the case for us. I like enjoying my time out and soaking it all in. We walked up to the host stand and the hostess came up walking and greeted us. The whole presentation and atmosphere of this restaurant is great. I think it's very clean and simple. Not too much is going on. We had juices from another place and she allowed us to bring it in. Great! She asked if we would like a booth or a table ? Easy! Booth always.... it's more comfortable and intimate. She sat us and as we sat we saw a table close by complaining about every little detail in their food... we laughed. We don't go off of other people's experiences we like to enjoy our own! I would like to add.. if you order food and you don't like the way the recipe is made or it doesn't satisfy your palette, it's okay to not like their cooking I say just deal. But if it's undercooked, overcooked, not prepared the way it should be, send it back. Everyone has their own taste, sometimes you just pick the wrong food item for you.. (for people who go out and are very particular about your food, just eat in.) So we browsed the menu to see what tasted good. What initially drew us here was the grilled mahi mahi tacos! I was craving some fish tacos and I wanted some tasty ones.. I ordered the steak taco plate and my fiancé ordered the mahi taco plate. They drop a big tub, I would say, of chips and salsa. Yum! Salsa was so goood! Food came out promptly I looked over and my fiancé had 3 tacos, mine had 2.. the menu said it came with 3.. so my ONLY complaint.. when we had asked the waitress after receiving our food if I'm suppose to have 3 tacos she said there was a lunch special going on and it comes with 2 tacos instead of 3 and rice and beans. So she chose to give me the lunch special instead of the 3 taco platter. It was okay I could've eaten the 3rd but was it necessary? No... I would've appreciated the communication about the lunch special to make that decision on my OWN. But let's talk about how my steak tacos tasted. Some of the tastiest steak I've had. Tender and the sauce in my tacos were so good. The grilled mahi was incredible too. Both came with rice and black beans was our choice. They have 4-5 different options. We opted for the basic stuff. We will be back for taco Tuesday, I am ready for more of the steak tacos!!"}
{"text":"We were searching for decent Mexican food for dinner tonight and Borracha's fit the bill and more!  My margarita was one of the best I've ever had ... chips and chunky salsa were great ... loved the mini (4) coconut shrimp tacos which I ordered as my entree ... and my husband's chicken enchiladas with rice and beans was fabulous. Although other reviewers have indicated the noise level is loud, it didn't interfere with our conversation and wasn't an issue. Our server was attentive and timely.  Can't wait to go back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"We have been here a number of times now. It's always good. I have the steak fajitas and my husband has the Slow Roasted Pork Carnitas. Both meals are always very good, as is the service. I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was quite good and the prices were very reasonable. I was expecting about $5 more per plate based on the atmosphere & the location in GVR.  The chips and salsa here were really good & they gave us a TON of them.  Entrees were good, not great. Definitely good enough to warrant a return visit as honestly, Las Vegas has a surprisingly poor Mexican Food scene."}
{"text":"Hailey our hot server was super helpful and friendly. The food was amazing and the drinks were good and skinny! Happy hot was great!"}
{"text":"Awesome service. One of the best margaritas I had, and I have had many. The tacos were superb! It was definitely worth the walk from the parking lot!"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and I've never been disappointed by the food or by the quality of service.  They always have specials that are real deals as well (Taco Tuesday...Knights support...etc...)  The free chips and salsa are delightful.  The chips are always warm and perfectly salted.  I like the flavor of the salsa and whether it is or not, it actually tastes house-made.  The drinks are over-sized and one margarita (free with a Yelp check-in!) is plenty to make you happy for the rest of the night.  The menu has a pretty good (and not too large) selection.  Shout out to the street corn side and the street tacos.  So good!  If I had any complaints about the street tacos, it would be that I don't like that they come with chips.  I already had a lot of free chips.  We should get the corn with them.  :)  Have I mentioned I like the street corn?"}
{"text":"Met some friends here for happy hour on a Friday night, 5pm. Its located inside the Green Valley Ranch casino.   The decor is very upscale and nice. They have a nice bar area, with gaming, located pretty much in the center of the room, with dining seating all around the edges, both booths and tables.   Service was very good, plenty of staff on hand to help customers. Food came out very quickly and was nicely presented. 5/5  Food quality....just ok. Nothing too exciting or interesting in flavors. I ordered from the happy hour menu, carne asada street tacos and a cheese quesadilla. My friend had nachos, another had the chicken tostadas, and another ordered from the regular menu mahi mahi tacos, which were pretty tasty. 3/5  Big negative was the margaritas...I had two and didn't feel anything. No alcohol content at all in them, which is disappointing because that flavor wasn't in the drinks either....I'd rate the drinks only 1/5.  Probably won't be back as there are better options around. Not bad if you are hungry and crave Mexican food while sitting inside the Green Valley Ranch, but not worth venturing out for."}
{"text":"Have you EVER heard of AYCE tacos along with margarita and tequila shots?  Well, it's a real thing my friends and this place offers that EVERY Tuesday.  It's located inside Green Valley Ranch, so you'll have to do some minor searching while inside, but IT'S. WORTH. IT.  It literally is all you can eat tacos for $24 and you get a pitcher of margaritas. They also help you 'kickstart' your appetite by giving you a round of tequila shots. Brace yourself. I've heard nothing, but dangerous things cause from these shots - PROCEED WITH CAUTION.  The salsa was amazing! It was so fresh and delicious. They also brought out guacamole that we had a hard time sharing amongst our table because we all wanted it. We were served 2 trays of tacos;  12 chicken tacos and 12 steak tacos. I didn't try any chicken tacos because I'm a loyal fan to steak. I'm sure the chicken was good, but the steak was obviously everyone's favorite because we order another 12 tacos!  We will definitely be back with even more friends."}
{"text":"This place was terrible.  Sat at the table without menus, took a good 5-10mins to get them.  Food was extremely flavorless and bland.  Mexican food done wrong.  Some of the items were super salty and then the rest were just under-seasoned.  Mahi tacos were dry.  Chile rellano was over fried and stuffed with coagulated watery cheese.  Gmo pepper on steroids.    Service was extremely awkward.  Took forever to get things we were asking for.  Took forever to get check, but they were quick to grab plates (with food still on them) off table cause they were closing.  Dj was good, music a little too loud.  Liked the art on the walls.    Skip this place."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to eating here,  but disappointed, very overpriced, and the service was very slow, and the food was just ok.    (Disappointed with the trash can nachos, that  I had heard so much about. )   However the margarita with pineapple and habanero was fantastic ! Sorry Guy - we won't be back"}
{"text":"Borracha is the best place to get a strong margarita and some great food!! If you're there for happy hour you must try the blood orange margarita or \"The Heat of the Night\" and the chicken nachos with a side of guacamole. They bring you fresh chips and salsa that is just amazing! Nachos are served in a cast iron skillet smothered in cheese sauce, shredded cheese, pico, and chicken. It's not one of those plates of nachos where you kinda have the scrape cheese or toppings off of other chips that have a ton of stuff on them. Not a sad lonely chip in sight. I came here with family so we ordered a bunch of stuff on the menu.   Tried the street tacos, one chicken and one beef. So good. Perfectly seasoned and not too much fuss with the frills. Like an actual street taco.   Guacamole was REALLY good. Tad on the salty side, but the second bowl was better. (Yea we had two! Don't judge) lol. Topped with a little slice of radish and crumbly white cheese.   Atmosphere was pleasant and lights progressively dimmed as it started to get busier. We also had amazing waiter!! She was adorable even though I never got my lime in my margarita. Lol. In all honesty she's (Ashley I think was her name) the only reason we stayed so long. My dad got there about 4. Happy hour is 4-7. We left around 9:45. Lol. We just sat and ate and drank because that's how enjoyable the service, atmosphere and food was.   If you're ever in Vegas and just need a place to chill in the cut for a bite and a drink, or you want to get lit before the club, this is the place! Turn up or turn down, they are where it's at. Just request Ashley and you're set!"}
{"text":"Love the salsa and chips here. My Margarita was nice and strong. Everything that we ordered was great. The waitress was attentive and checked in with us to make sure we were enjoying our dinner and made sure our drinks stayed full!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Great atmosphere and the service is excellent! I ordered the carne Asada brown rice bowl and it was very tasty. Overall good experience and fairly priced."}
{"text":"You had me at a flaming skull cocktail and queso.  I had a great experience here. The parking is easy and plentiful, the spot easy to find, and the staff really playful and fun. Joaquin ( I probably butchered the spelling) was attentive and fun and took great care of my friend and I. We sat at a booth in the back and got after it.   The queso is perfection. It pulls for days and was nice and bubbly when it arrived at our table. We also got the sampler with all the appetizers your heart could dream of. Call me a purist, but the cheese quesadilla was my favorite. The tortilla was perfectly warmed and slightly crispy. The cheese melted all the way though.   Looking forward to my next trip out. I think I might get a little crazy at the bar next time! We'll see!"}
{"text":"The whole menu looked AMAZING and our adorable server, Hayley, had wonderful recommendations. Great bar, great atmosphere, great service, overall 10/10 would come again!!"}
{"text":"After trying a number of dishes, I really like their food! It's much better than I expected.  The Mahi Mahi bowl was very good (especially with their hot salsa) and the salmon plate with slaw was even better! If you like salmon, this dish is a winner.   I also had the carne asada tacos and the chile relleno. I was surprised that the portion is one relleno and not 2, though it was a pretty good size. The presentation was great but didn't make up for just that one!  For appetizers, the guac is impressive, and the crab ceviche tacos were excellent! Their chips and salsa are good as well. Prices are moderately expensive, with entrees ranging from $15 for chicken tacos to $25 for the salmon plate. Happy hour is 4-7 Mon-Fri with $6 margs and $6 menu items. The house margarita was fantastic, and I also had the Heat of the Moment, served with 2 red chiles, that was just OK.  The one dessert I've tried is the churros ice cream sandwich. Another winner! The decor is upscale and the murals on all the walls are impressive. Music is too loud for my taste. If I may be so bold as to make a prediction, this place may be around for just as long, if not longer, than the space sat dormant!"}
{"text":"I never got to dine here Young girls in front told us we had to wait and restaurant not busy In walks party of 5 they take them right in Manager Johan an ass has no customer service says cant seat us waiting for people to show up and took party of 5 right in as there was a big table Young blk girl starts smerki g rudely i addressed her He says i was being   Rude to her but never knew how to resolve issue and find us seats Place was not busy Rudely says Happy Thanksgiving We are older people and found these young people extremely rude and unprofessional We live here Will share our poor experience"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Borracha for happy hour. We arrived around 5:00 and asked for a booth. We were told the booths were only for people with reservations. Okay, never heard of that before but we were seated quickly at a nice table. Hayley was our server and was outstanding! The service here was excellent the entire evening and the happy hour food came out quickly. As soon as we sat down a large bowl of salsa arrived with warm chips.   Borracha's happy hour is $6 for draft beer, wine, margaritas and food. We ordered the chicken nachos, steak tacos (2), chicken tacos (2), mini chicken tostadas and a side of guac. The guac came out first and was delicious. Nice and chunky and presented nicely with cojita cheese and 2 radishes.  Then the nachos, tostadas and tacos arrived. Overall everything was very good. The jalapeño cheese on the nachos was soooo good! The four mini tostadas had chicken, tomatoes, corn, black beans and a poblano cream. The tacos were our least favorite item. We didn't care for the corn tortillas. They had a strange texture and flavor that we didn't like.   Borracha has a  great dessert menu for those of us with a  sweet tooth. Frosted flakes rice pudding, flan, tres leches, and a cinnamon churro ice cream sandwich which we couldn't pass up. The churro was a little hard but the flavor was delicious and paired perfectly with the vanilla gelato. It is served with a side of warm chocolate sauce which we were happy to pour on top.   Throughout our dinner we were constantly checked on by Hayley and other servers and our drinks were always refilled without asking. The manager stopped by our table when we were done to make sure we enjoyed everything. 5+ stars for service!   We will definitely be returning to try to some more items and come back for happy hour. Borracha is a great addition to GVR!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!! Margarita was one of the best I'd ever had. Tacos we're delicious. I would highly recommend this place. Chips and salsa was better than most!!"}
{"text":"Thought to come to Borracha for their brand new reverse happy hour and it was everything and more than we expected! Their happy hour is 9-close which is so convenient if you want to go somewhere to get a quick, good, cheap drink!  Upon arrival my friend and I sat at the bar. Kelsey was our barback and Jesus was the barback. They were both super attentive and knew a lot about the menu. We both got the house margarita's for $6 which were to die for! I ended up getting the quesadilla which is a pretty good size for the happy hour and my friend got he carnitas off of the regular menu. They were both delicious and came with chips and salsa to snack on. We ordered multiple margaritas and a few tequila shots... everything was brought out quick and service was phenomenal!!! Will definitely be back in my near future."}
{"text":"Food was great. I ordered happy hour empanadas and tostadas. Came in Monday for the game and sat at the bar. Great deal with the free beer and shot when a goal is made! Although service seemed unbalanced. One bartender with dark hair looked very busy and was running around trying to check on all of us as much as possible while also making drinks. The other was talking to 1 maybe 2 guests and never approached me. I noticed she was sort of looking bored and that confused me because the other girl looked very busy.  Overall the food was great, drinks are great but staffing needs work."}
{"text":"Something new to check out with a vegan menu, I ordered the portobello tacos. They left something to be desired. It needed a sauce or something on it otherwise it tastes like something I can cook at home (came with plain brown rice and black beans...) my husband ordered the smoked tomato soup, it was too spicy to enjoy.  I will try this place again and hopefully the next option I pick it is better.   Also we highly suspect the table salsa is Pace ;)"}
{"text":"Last night was our first time , best Mexican food I have had in a really long time. Atmosphere is cool and the bartender was very friendly and gave great customer service"}
{"text":"Last time, we went here was during Taco Tuesday and waited for an hour or so to get seated. My first time there was less than impressive as everything seemed like an afterthought. But then I realized, it was busy that day. My server was probably swamped with a few tables and other obligations. So we decided to try it once again. This time with a reservation.   The seating was a lot faster than we expected with a choice of booth, table, or bar. We decided for a more intimate setting so booth was the selection for the night.   Upon seating, the chips and salsa were immediately placed to our table and our glasses were filled to the rim. Then, cues our waitress who was kind enough to give us a few minutes to brush over the menu and tended to our table as much as she could. A few times, she stopped by our table just to make sure we were okay and whether we needed anything else.   We ordered an appetizer sampler which was sheer genius. This came with two empanadas, two taquitos, two tostadas, and four quesadillas. I can't even begin to talk about this contraption. This honestly was the highlight of my dining experience and this alone, would fill you up given if you didn't share with anyone else. A real steal of the night when you're trying to look for variety. The empanadas had a flaky crust with a delicious beef stuffing in it. The taquitos were flavorful upon every bite while the tostadas became my favorite of all. They're super small in size-- almost like a circular nacho with beef toppings over it. The marinade on that meat was absolutely divine. When it comes to meat, this is the absolute example of how I want them all to taste like: hint of heat, sweet and salty, along with a juicy, tender texture. I couldn't get enough of it. The quesadillas were also very good as they used quality cheese to heighten the appetizer.   As a main entree, I decided to get the chicken burrito. Normally, this would come drenched in sauce but I'm happy my server was kind enough to suggest to put it on the side. Unlike any other burritos you get from a restaurant, this was something a tad bit special. All ingredients worked together to complete the entree in a way that made me wish I could stomach more.   My girlfriend got the grilled salmon on a bed of sautéed vegetables. She loved it as it was crispy on the bottom with the right seasoning to balance the plate. Pair this entree with rice, and you're golden. There was no way you could go wrong with that dish. A must try.   After our meal, we had a choice of dessert and decided to try their tres leche cake. I don't even know what to tell you... wow. There's a popular bakery around town who's well known for their tres leche... but I have to tell you that this cake absolutely dominated that dessert. It stood tall surrounding a sweetened milk topped with whipped cream. Soak the cake on the bath of that milk and you'll never want to leave. My god; it was good.   The service was exceptionally welcoming as their director of operations stopped by to chat with us. Complimenting and relating to my favorite football team, the Eagles. At the same time, my server went above and beyond to make sure we were okay. It was a different atmosphere from when we first visited and I'm very happy for the absolute change of hospitable gestures.   Now the question is, would I come back? Absolutely. I'll be grabbing more of those flavorful dishes with friends and family sometime in the near future."}
