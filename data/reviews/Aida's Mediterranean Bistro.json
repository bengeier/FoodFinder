{"text":"This place is a little gem! The decor is lovely, the staff are friendly, and the food is so delicious, authentic, and tastes home made! Love it!"}
{"text":"Unlike most Lebanese restaurants in Calgary, this place is sit-down and has table service.

I love basically everything on the menu. I usually get the shawarma platter with fattoush salad on the side, but it's also a nice place to get a few friends together, and share some mezze platters (the muhammara is awesome) and wine."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Lots of flavor and so fresh. You must try the mohamara dip, it is one if the most delicious things I have ever had.

Favorites are the lemon chicken sandwich and the veggie mezza. I have vegan friends I've taken here on numerous occasions and there are plenty of options for them as well.

Staff are always pleasant, service is quick, I'm a regular and I still can't get enough of this place!"}
{"text":"I am surprised by the negative reviews.  Perhaps these clients had bad experience with the staff but mine was great.  As soon as we entered the place we were greeted and seated at a table.  The service was friendly and quick and the food was delicious.  I had the shawarma platter -- highly recommended.  

I also disagree with the person who described the place as cramped.  The bistro has high ceilings and the tables are well spaced.   If you want to see a cramped restaurant go visit one in the Paris's Latin Quarter."}
{"text":"The food here is very good if you like things like falafel, humus, & fatayer.  This kind of food sometimes gets a bad rap because the only time people have it is when they are near a mall food court or a cheap fast food place like Falafel King.  But this place actually takes their time to prepare high quality food.  

It is always busy between 11-2 and 5-9, so if you don't have a reservation expect a wait.   And try the dip sampler, I forget what it's called, but the walnut pomegranate dip is really great."}
{"text":"The food was ok. The service was terible!We ordered apetizers but they never brought it to us. It was really noisy and busy so we couldn't easily hear the waitress, and she wouldn't come closer and we had to yell and she had to yell as well! And finally she made one of those angry faces which no costumer likes it! Also when 2 of my friends started talking to the waitress at the same time, she suddenly yelled at them rudely\"who is the first? I can't listen to both of you!\". Then my friend asked for a glass of water and she told him see if anyone doesn't want his water, take that one! when my friend asked for a fresh glass of water she tried to refill it in his beer glass!!! Overall we didn't enjoy it very much. Food might be good but service is more important!"}
{"text":"I'm here a few times a year, but my last visit wasn't as good as the others. Nevertheless, I still give this place 5 stars.

After growing up in the middle east, and Lebanese was always a common meal, this place still reminds me of our old take-out nights. The shawarmas aren't like the ones I'd get street side back in the day, but the falafels and hummus always bring back the memories.

We always get the veggie mezza for 2, with fattoush salad - what makes it delicious? sumac, lemon/olive oil dressing, crispy pita - yummm!
Along with that we get a side order of our favourite tabbouleh salad. 

The mouhammara (roasted red pepper and walnut dip) is amaaazzzzing! A while ago they gave a newspaper a version of the recipe, I'm sure they kept a few secrets out,  my mom and I will make it quite a bit and it always delivers.

On my last visit we were invited by a very gross smell of cigarrette smoke, it was overpowering, the waittress said perhaps because there was a man trying to fix the front door, who knows... it was unappetizing though. 

The falafels were overcooked and very dry.

Now, the tabbouleh they make isn't the one that has the large amounts of bulgar, because recipes do vary, however this time it was a very minimal amount, less than I've ever seen  - even here. I like the versions that use less bulgar than parsley but I think they missed quite a bit here. There was barely any bulgar. 


Overall - a few misses on my last visit but I remain a loyal fan of Aida's."}
{"text":"As for the food I can't complain - not only were the portions quite large, ensuring you had leftovers for the next day if you so desired, the dishes we ordered were tasty & in my option very original, refreshing & unique!

For appy's the group picked the \"Mouhammara\" & \"Fatayer\" & on my goodness were they ever tasty! Mmm The former was a splendid blend of red pepper paste, walnuts & pomegranate juice dip that had a very pleasant but delicate 'kick' to it, while the latter was a flat little triangle-shaped soft pita filled with spinach that I found simply delightful! Just the two appy's were a perfect size for the four of us to share. The price for the two was no more than $3.5 each. 

For the main dish, I had the curried lamb couscous for $19. Very big dish with the cutest little serving of couscous & roasted potatoes however it came with a very big serving of lamb cubes, saut√©ed with, zucchini, eggplant & green peppers. So good but so filling. Also order in the group was the Kafta Kabob platter, which consisted of seasoned minced beef served over rice & came with a salad of your choice - the \"Fattoush\" salad was the choice which was a wonderful combination of romaine lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, radishes, green peppers, and pita chips in a sumac and olive oil dressing. 
As for our fellow dining companions, I believe they both ordered Shawarma wraps, which looked absolutely scrumptious & very filling too!

As for dessert... no one had any because we were all stuffed!
I was very impressed with the dessert menu because for the size of restaurant they had (which is quite cozy), they had at eight options you could choose from. 

Overall, Aida had good food & we were able to stay under a reasonable budget even when buying drinks - it was about $25/per person. That's pretty good in my books, not bad at all.
It was a good experience.
Check it out and decide for yourselves."}
{"text":"Aida's is the best place for sit-down Mediterranean in Calgary."}
{"text":"Food and Service terrible. This is a long-time fave for me and a few of my friends / colleagues. Unfortunately, today the service was downright awful - as though it was a bother for my group and I to be there. In addition to being slow, the staff was in a foul mood. As for the food, it was sub-par at best. The green beans were over-cooked (canned, anyone?) the couscous had been over-flavoured with almond, tabouleh too vinegared. On top of everything, they added an 18% gratuity. I usually don't mind an added gratuity for a large group. I guess today the server didn't need to try since she knew she was getting tipped anyway."}
{"text":"Good spot. The food is good and the portions are quite large. We had the dip sampler to share, and this was excellent. We found the mouhammara excellent. Our entrees (couscous, kafta kabob and lamb kabob) were all very good too and tasty. The baklava was rich... As a baklava should be! The service is very friendly. I recommend that place should you seek good and original food with lots of flavor."}
{"text":"Baklava was mind-blowing.  I will go there again at least for baklava. 

Prices were reasonable.  Staff were nice. Food was delicious.  We ordered dawa basha and kafta kabab. 

The spinach and lentil soup was ok but not special."}
{"text":"I prefer Lebanese over almost all other cuisines and have found that Aidas is the best in Calgary. The prices are reasonable, the service is good, although sometimes slow, but then again food is about enjoying slowly with a glass of wine. 

I suggest the humus, falafel and spinach & lentil soup as flavourful starters. I usually follow-up with a shish taouk or beef platter. Try it, you can't go wrong and won't beat it for flavour and price."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the mouhamara dip. It's a must-try.

The other thing you must do if you want to eat at Aida's is make a reservation. We have never been able to get a table without pre-booking one. There's a reason for that. The restaurant is small and the food is stellar. Everything is made from scratch and the chef knows how to make flavours sing.

I've been here a number of times over the years and the food is consistently good. From the falafels to the baba ghanoush to the meat dishes, if you like Lebanese food, you'll enjoy your eating experience here. And you won't leave hungry. The portions are very generous.

The service is a bit slow and the staff seem overworked and not always very happy.

The decor is simple and no fuss, which is fine. This place is all about good eats and they deliver."}
{"text":"Friendly, if slow, service. The food was lacking. Each item I ordered was \"off\" by a bit as compared to home-prepared versions of the same dish. The Fatoush was too soggy, the orange-blossom scent of the lemonade was barely there, and the muhammara was too salty and oily. I didn't find it a good value for the price."}
{"text":"My family has started going to Aida's a lot over the past year or so, and I never seemed to be able to make it. Last night I finally got to try it with my mom and sister. 

We ordered the mouhammara, fatayer, shawarma platter, falafel platter, and the grilled chicken sandwich. I was reluctant to order the mouhammara, thinking I would prefer another type of dip. My sister insisted the mouhammara was the best choice, and I am so glad I tried it! Definitely recommend ordering this. Great combination of sweet and nutty. I also recommend trying their iced tea. It is house made with rose water. 

The grilled chicken sandwich was amazing. I am going to have trouble ordering any thing else when I return. Garlic paste, grilled chicken and pickles inside a pan fried crispy pita. What more could you ask for? I love garlic and this sandwich had plenty of it. 

The service was great, and the restaurant wasn't too busy. Sounds like reservations may be required on fridays and saturdays."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a long time, and it did not disappoint! Came here with my friend for a Saturday lunch. We got a reservation as it is a small restaurant. I'm glad we did, as it filled up pretty quickly after we were seated. We both had the iced tea with rose water, which was not too sweet and quite refreshing. 
For our appy, we just got some hummus and pita to share. The hummus is amazing! One of my close friend's mother is from Syria, and makes the best hummus, so I have high standards when it comes to hummus. This did not disappoint. I got the Shawarma sandwich, and it was delicious. My friend got the Grilled Chicken pita wrap, and said it was really good. We were very happy we got to try Aida's, and we will both be back soon! My friend actually took her parents there the next weekend, it's that good."}
{"text":"The one star is for the service given by Megan.  The food is absolutely great and we are regulars of this restaurant and I would give this restaurant 5 stars.  Unfortunately, the last 2 times we have visited, we have got stuck with this waitress.  Both times, she did not bother to check with us, refill our water (we had to ask 2 other servers to do this) and it was only till the end, that she started becoming nice which was at tip time.  I would understand if the restaurant was busy but it was not. We noticed that she was the same way with other patrons and was lacking in her knowledge of the menu.  We noticed her telling the table next to us whether they knew what was on their plate and if they needed her to explain what they are.  A good server would simply do it anyways.  This review is for the management to perhaps offer some additional training in customer service."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favourite restaurants in Calgary for years.  Lots of vegetarian options but meat lovers delight as well.  The muhammara is to die for."}
{"text":"Visiting Calgary for business, found his place on Yelp. Nice and cozy place, food is very good, service was great. The plate was very good size, well oriented. I ordered the Kufta kebab, it was delicious. I would come back again here in the future."}
{"text":"They don't have the greatest vegetarian options, and the service was alright. It's a very loud restaurant and not really great if you want to have an intimate dinner. The server took forever getting us our drinks, which was frustrating."}
{"text":"Good service!  Great location!  Good food!  Will definitely go back to this place.  It seems like a upscale Lebanese restaurant, but pricing is quite moderate."}
{"text":"Great spot. We came here on a Tuesday night, later in the evening and had no problem getting a table. We didn't want to eat anything too heavy because of the time but we were both starving. I ended up with the falafel platter while my date had the kebab platter. We each got a different salad with it so we could try each others stuff.

Everything was delicious. Lots of flavour, lots of texture and the service was friendly too.
The meal really hit the spot and the prices were reasonable. The only thing that could of been better is that as we finished our tea up after our meals, the place was closing. We appreciate not wanting anyone to make us stay late so we got ready to leave. Despite the server saying there was no rush, we were getting looks from the back of the house folks so we felt compelled to get out of there right away (a couple of minutes past the closing time). Not a big deal but it felt like things suddenly had become less friendly. But we'll probably be back soon!"}
{"text":"2 stars is simply for the food. However, I was disappointed with the fact that after I said I was celiac, my salad had pita in it. They took it back and told me they had scraped the salad off my plate and made a new salad.... Yet the pita had contaminated my plate. It's like saying I'm allergic to peanuts, oh don't worry I'll scrape the peanut butter off your plate. 


Also many times before I've been told the falafel is GF. And it's not. Not impressed."}
{"text":"It was a really cute place to go and eat I love it when places are super busy and it was so quiet for me and my boyfriend. The waitress was super helpful in regards to telling us what foods to try my overall experience was really good , the food was pretty good as well not what I am use to but it's worth trying. I suggest anyone who wants a different dining experience to try it out! I find going later in the night is a lot better less people. I got the donair and it was very filling for only 10$ not a bad price and some fresh baked potatoes were my favourite part. Thanks for having us! I will come again."}
{"text":"Great little spot, the food is very good! Lamb kebab sandwich tasted amazing. Also very good hummus :] service was slow but I think she was new. My cousin says its normally better."}
{"text":"The fragrance fills the air and you begin to drool in anticipation as soon as you walk in the door of this quaint Mediterranean bistro.  A group of six of us enjoyed sharing several appetizers and some lovely white wine.  Great value and we were all full.  Also split a baklava.   Delightful and attentive service.

Recommend making a reservation though.  It was a Wednesday night and there were at least five tables reserved"}
{"text":"Good food. liked their falafel sandwich. However, it was a bit dry and we had to ask them for some tahini."}
{"text":"Last week, I met a bunch of friends at Aida's. I hadn't been there since being back in town (5 years or so), so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.

Let me tell you - IT. WAS. FANTASTIC!

First of all, it is right on 4th Street, which has an impressive stretch of great restaurants on it. But let's be honest, once you've had Aida's, WHY would you go anywhere else on the stretch?!?!?

Yes, Aida's is very tiny. Yes, it gets very hot (I don't think they have air conditioning), but honestly, all of this is outweighed by the excellent mediterranean cuisine!

Very few places know how to make good Middle Eastern food. Usually it ends up overcooked and underflavoured. At Aida's, I ordered the vegetarian couscous. Other entrees at our table included the falafal, the sampler plate and the mousaka. 

ALL of it was DELICIOUS.

We even found a way to make room for dessert.

I would highly recommend Aida's to anyone who enjoys great food and a welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Aida's is a tiny little restaurant on 4th street that I have been going to now since around 2001. My parents stumbled into it one evening and never left after downing in a vat of the best baba ghanoush I've ever had. They live there now. As do I.

Of course I don't. But if I could find an apartment directly above this restaurant, I would likely eat enough labneh and baba ghanoush to kill a small horse. 

Eating here, like many places, can be challenging for me because I have some of the most annoying food allergies on Earth that include not only peanuts and most other nuts, but the entire legume family. So beans, peas, chickpeas, lentils... I can't have any of it. If you've put two and two together just now, you'll have realized that this means I've never had hummus before. *GASP* Yes it's true. This makes eating at Aida's tough, because I've not been able to enjoy their legendary hummus or walnut dip. But enough of this self-pity. Let me tell you about the things I can eat and how amazing they are.

The baba ghanoush. I can't stress this enough. Please eat this. It's unreal. Smokey, creamy, so good. The labneh is also amazing. Smooth and cool and just plain awesome. Get some as an appetizer and save some to dip your garlic chicken cubes into that you ordered as your entr√©e. And when asked if you want rice or potatoes as a side, you want the potatoes. Believe me.

While I have to say, that over the last 5 years or so, Aida's has slipped ever so slightly in quality, it's still great. I go there to eat baba ghanoush and labneh alone, so, that really says something.

Yelp 30 day challenge: 1/30."}
{"text":"What a wonderful lunch! This is one of my favorite places. The one dip i am so addicted to is their Mouhammara, it the most amazimg dip i have ever had. I always order one to eat there and take three home. I normally order grape leaves as well and a original Mezza platter served with grape leaves, falafel, baba ghannouj, hummus, kibby, fatayer, sfeeha, labneh. Great for 2-3 people. The grape leaves are served warm and just the right spices and lemon, their falafel are wonderful with a great not to dry and crumbly. The only thing i would of liked more would be the hummus. I felt lacking. It had a weak tahini taste. I loved the baba cause it was not as smoky as other places. It was perfectly spiced as well. They give you plenty of pita breads for dipping and a lot of food for the price. A great place to go for a romantic date or just hang out with friends, cozy and quiet and has a wonderful table service."}
{"text":"Middle Eastern food is tricky for me. I dont crave it too often, so when I do, it better be good. I have been to restaurants where they make it too dry or too bland.. and I have been to restaurants where its delicious. 
Aida was more on the 'delicious' side of my radar. I ordered the lamb kabob platter, with the Tabouleh and baba ganouj. The tabouleh salad was great, the baba ganouj was tasty - you cant go wrong with eggplant - and the lamb skewers were delicious! I only wish the skewers werent as small! I wiped my plate clean!

The location of the restaurant is great, and the atmosphere is pretty relaxed too."}
{"text":"I had genuinely forgotten how great the food is here. Everything tastes fresh and is incredibly satisfying. Went with family for a birthday and even the picky eaters were happy which is always a win in my book.

To start we all shared the garlic prawns (huge size and great amount of garlic), Baba Ghannouj served with pita (eggplant dip that is quite creamy and oh so tasty), Fatayer (3x triangles of tasty filled with spinach), Sfeeha (3x triangular pastry filled with nicely spiced beef and a great cucumber type dip to go with). Everything disappeared in seconds.

For mains, sister had broiled lamb chops - really good size and well seared on the outside with just pink on the inside, she loved the potatoes that came with it.
The boy tried curried lamb with coucous - said the flavour was complex enough that it didn't need to be more spicy and the vegetables in the dish were a good addition.
Dad tried the lamb kabob with hummus and fattoush salad - was really surprised by how much he enjoyed the salad and the lamb was cooked to his liking.
Mom went with the baked halibut encrusted with fennel and cumin seeds - clear winner at the table! The fish was cooked perfectly and the crust was unreal tasty. Amazing combination of spices done just right. Also loved her potatoes.
I went with the Shish Tawook (chicken kabob) over rice with hummus and tabbouli salad - chicken had a nice flavour but would almost have liked a little more of the marinade poured over so it went on the rice too to share that great flavour. Hummus was really creamy and would like some more right now. The salad was very fresh and a huge portion.

Everyone was very full by the time we were done so no dessert. Would really like to go back and share one of the mezza platters as a main dish. And maybe have space for dessert :)"}
{"text":"I will pile on with everyone else. I go here when I crave muhammara. That said I have enjoyed the rest of the food as well I think. See, I remember having the lamb chops once and they were good but I recall nothing else beyond the muhammara... perhaps it puts me in a food coma glaze that prevents my memory from processing the remaining food items. At any rate it is delicious. 

The only reason its not 5 stars for me is 2 fold. Firstly - Loud. If a large group comes in or a family with kids... it gets very loud very quickly to the point of where I wish they would all go away. 1st time I was there a loud drunkish girl at a large groups table made conversation at our own table difficult due to the noise, my second visit a family with 2 kids yelling and playing like they were in their own living room. 

secondly - it can be cold. People come in and hold doors open and if its nippy outside you are blasted with the cold air ... they have a 2 door entry to help and I'm sure it does but it still gets a blast especially given people are selfish in general in their bubble of existence and think of no one else but themselves almost all of the time. So people will stand there waiting for a party member holding doors open oblivious to the restaurant full of people not wearing their coats. 

 So my negatives, not the restaurant's fault really but atmosphere and acoustics are what they are and I kind of hate that part of it so they lose a star.

I also like the mediterranean coffee.

Food and service are solid and I will be back for .... you guessed it muhammara."}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Great service. Very fresh. Will definitely be back.

The shish tawook and the herb lemon chicken platter were outstanding.

Alex was a great server. Really attentive and made great suggestions."}
{"text":"I have never really had to much Mediterranean food before so my experience may be jaded.

I thought the food was delicious, I wasnt big on the grape leaves, my server was really nice and joked around with my over all ineptitude with the cuisine which made me feel more comfortable"}
{"text":"The best dips in the city. Great service. Always feel like a guest in Aida's kitchen. Staff is friendly and the ambiance is lovely and quiet!"}
{"text":"If you want to look at bad customer service do visit this place. The first time I went with a friend, her food was cold so we requested a change and the waitress barked at us. I still gave them the benefit of doubt and went with a group. While the food was brought to the group, I checked with the waitress if mine was on the way. Her response I have 2 hands only. If you are in the hospitality industry perhaps the owner needs to train the staff the golden rule be kind to your customer and attentive to them. After this xperience they lost me and my friends as their customer and of course never going to recommend them till we hear of them resetting their attitude"}
{"text":"Absolutely pleased with our meal last night. We ordered a vegetarian mezze, plus lamb chops. We absolutely loved the mouhammara dip. I didn't expect to be wowed - I mean - how great can a dip be? It has this buttery, nutty sweet taste that is just amazing. I bought another one to go for my bf to try. Another winner was this cigar shaped phyllo with cheese. Parsley salad was very refreshing. Lamb chops were tender and tasty. More than enough food for the two of us. Service was excellent. Chickpea fritters were freshly made - nice crunchy exterior and fluffy inside, though a bit too salty for us. Great option in the Mission district."}
{"text":"My friend chose Aida's for a dinner out when she came to town on a regular visit. We've made a habit of tracking down new places we've heard good things about, but this one was a surprise to me. This cozy restaurant on 4th street is a bit of a tight squeeze on a busy night, but well worth it. The decor is warm and inviting, and the music selection was light and intriguing - a blend of Mediterranean beats that only added to the experience.
The menu is quite varied, offering a broad selection of combinations or al la carte items. Everything we had - from appetizers to dinner to beverages and dessert - were delicious, and served by polite, very accommodating staff. For our friend in the party who's vegetarian - lots of options to suit his needs, and they were more than willing to make substitutions.
I will certainly go back to Aida's for a future Mediterranean fix."}
{"text":"I had Vegetarian Platter with Hummus and Fattoush. I like the texture of their pita. I have tried different mixture and texture of this bread I like theirs. Over all, It's quiet small but I like it. Had tried several Lebanese cuisine  and this bistro serves a good one."}
{"text":"After reading all the review we decided to do birthday dinner there. I was very disappointed though after dinner. I was not happy with food. I am not sure was it because we were a big group or this is how it was suppose to be . Although service was good but we were 12 of us and no one liked their food. There is much better Mediterranean food places in Calgary.This place was over priced for  location and decoration. Lamb shank was super dry and couscous left me speechless to know how hard it is to make couscous. From our experience I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"So after testing some amazing Middle-Eastern in Montreal, I was led to this place on a visit to Calgary by an extremely reliable source and was definitely not disappointed!

We opted for the the vegetarian meza to taste as many things as possible. Everything we tasted was delicious and from my understanding, this is pretty much the only place to get quality Middle-Eastern in Calgary. I can't recommend anything specially as I very much enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"Mouhammara. Enough said. As a self-proclaimed dip connoisseur, I like to think I have somewhat of an exercised ability to judge creations as these. Aida's does a crazy amazing Mouhammara, which is made up of roasted red peppers, walnuts, breadcrumbs, spices, and olive oil. It's vibrant colour is enticing and the taste is perfection. Served with triangular slices of pita bread, this is the reason I go to Aida's, and I must say that the dip never disappoints."}
{"text":"Food was very good, as was the service.  So many interesting flavors and textures, I will definitely be back.  The servers are also quite nice to look at ;)"}
{"text":"This is one of the first places i went to when i moved to the Calgary, and the last place i ate when i left. It is by far one of the best Lebanese restaurants i have ever been too. We would order the vegetarian platter which is perfect for two people. I miss this place."}
{"text":"I left Calgary three years ago and came in to town for a business dinner last week. I decided to have it where I could impress 
my party. None of them had ever been to Aida's before. 

So I asked our server Madison to just start bringing dips, pita and platters. We ate like royalty with impeccable service.
5 people were fed including a home made dessert, with a bottle of wine for $150. 
My guest was so impressed that he picked up the tab and the business meeting went well. 

Aida's is a can't miss for best bang for your taxed dollars. When you can't risk the experience, Aida's is the perfect place to show off your  Mouhummara and babaganoush knowledge, and I know of four people who be regulars after a that dinner!"}
{"text":"I was here this past Saturday for lunch. What an amazing meal...unforgettable.
Enjoyed a very delicious assortment of kibbeh (ground spiced meat encased in a shell of bulgar wheat), falafel with tahini, spinach and mushroom baked pastry, meat pasty, mouhammara sauce with fresh vegetable, hoummus with pita etc.
This was all so delicious. And then came the desserts- baklava standard and filled with pistachios, cakes etc.

When I'm back in Calgary, this will be my MUST eat here place!!"}
{"text":"This past Friday its 5:30 pm and looking for a place to eat on 4th Street and walk in to this restaurant and the staff must have thought we were invisible as they failed to acknowledge our presence. On top of the fact the place was EMPTY - not one table occupied!!
This place is small, cramped and the decor is cafeteria style.
My advice keep walking...based purely on the staff's lack of \"service\""}
{"text":"This place was by far the most delicious Mediterranean food I have had outside of the Mediterranean. My coworkers and I were very set on Mediterranean food one night and after reading the reviews for this place, we just had to see if it lived up to our expectations.  

Long story short: it surpassed them. We ordered the dip sampler to start and if we hadn't we would not have experienced the amazingness of the Mouhammara dip. We couldn't get enough of it! We had to order another serving of it to get through dinner and beg the waitress for the recipe so we could make it when we go back home to the US. Aida's should give free samples on the street so the world knows what it has to offer.

In addition to the Mouhammara, we all ordered the lamb plate which also exceeded expectations. The meat was tender and flavorful and just everything a lamb plate should be. The service was wonderful, the drinks were good, but if you go here all you need to know is that you NEED the MOUHAMMARA."}
{"text":"Went to Aida's last night for a family dinner.  The food was really great!

We had the kibby, fatayer, and sfeeha to start which are all super flavourful.  The sfeeha were my personal favorite, with well seasoned meat and soft fluffy dough tart.

The Lamb kabob platter was very good, the lamb portion could have been a bit larger as there were 2 small skewers with 6 1 inch cubes of lamb on each.  Either slightly larger cubes or a third skewer would have been nice.  The Tabouli salad was very good with lots of parsley and lemon flavour and just the right amount of tomato and onion.  The real star for me however was the Baba Ghannouj it was absolutely amazing and I could have had a dinner of solely it and pita."}
{"text":"While there is a reason Aida's has been in business for so long, I find the spectrum of service runs from okay to awful. This would never be a place I would go to if I was in a hurry, as the total time seems to crawl... by... It d-r-a-a-a-a-g-s before you even get your food. If you're hungry (I was starving) it isn't so much about enjoying the food but fighting off your own stomach! 

Still, the food is good enough to be a decent reward for your patience. Great Lebanese food. I prefer the appetizers, I really don't think you can go wrong with them. Even those take a long time to come from the kitchen. I don't know. The service is slow enough that they get three stars, but the food is worth four at least. 

I think the call is based on your own food-values. Are you a foodie, willing to fight through anything (bears, mountains, etc) for a good meal or are you a service stickler? In this case, I am more in number 2."}
{"text":"While waiting for my pizza pickup @ Bocce's across the street, decided to see what's nearby that's also good---who else does that? 

So off I go, going for the mouhammara that everyone seems to pipin' about, and for an appie, it's a nice start, and somewhat healthy too lol, red peppers and all.  I did wish I could've added the hummus from the pics.

It's a nice, dimmed atmosphere, tonite with a few happy groups,  Kinda loud, as it's a small restaurant.

Friendly service.

Clean washrooms."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.
This place has the potential to be much better because of its location but unfortunately the service was meager, and our food was COLD !
The Couscous was more like mashed potato, however the appetizers were very good.
Overall, it was not worth the money. Not going back."}
{"text":"I always love when I come back to an old favourite after a long hiatus and everything is as it should be-the food is still amazing, the ambiance hasn't changed and the service still attentive and friendly. 

Such was my experience at Aida's today when I met my best friend for lunch. It was also a wonderful choice as she's working on being one of those plant-based only diet people who also cannot consume gluten (you may call her a vegan except that she's not giving up leather... so, plant-based only diet people it is as it's strictly a food/health choice at this point).

1130 was a good time to come, we were only the second table in the restaurant at that point, although it had filled up much more by about 1215.

Platters are the way to go at Aida's. I've been known on more than one occasion to split a mezza platter with a friend over wine one afternoon, which is a beautiful experience in and of itself. For today's lunch, however, just a regular platter did quite nicely. The best friend had the falafel one with no pita chip things in it and I opted for the shawarma platter. You get your choice of hummus or baba ghannouj and fattoush or tabbouli salad. I opted for the shawarma platter with hummus and tabbouli salad... soooo good, very filling and man alive did it ever arrive at our table in record time! Our entire dining experience was finished by 1215. Of course we stayed on at the table a wee bit longer to maximize our visiting time, and our server was very gracious about ensuring we felt welcome to do so... but if you're on a super strict 1 hr lunch crunch, I'd say Aida's has you covered with the platter lunches!"}
{"text":"I just ate, hands down, the best Lebanese food I've ever had.  Thanks to Erin D's accompaniment and recommendations, I was able to share The Veggie Mezza for Two, Burma and Layali Loubnan.  I cannot even begin to describe how flavorful and exquisite every morsel of this cuisine was.  The spices were plentiful but not overpowering.  I don't feel like I could kill fragile beings with my breath, which is how I recently felt after eating falafel elsewhere.  

This is a smart and simply decorated bistro.  Casual attire is all you need in this laid back atmosphere.  Prices are reasonable for the quantity.  I had more than enough food.  I like to eat my entire meal and be totally satisfied, yet not take home leftovers.  Service was fine.

I definitely would recommend Aida's to friends and out-of-town guests."}
{"text":"Not only was our server incredibly friendly, she was also very enthusiastic about helping us make decisions off of the large scrumptious menu. When asked about the difference between the platters and the entrees, she admitted that the latter don't feature as much variety and take much longer to prepare. She seemed to have read our mind as we were both quite hungry and always prefer nibbling on a variety of flavours.

My Vegetarian Delight included crunchy falafel balls, dense little fatayer (which are like spanakopita wrapped in thick pastry), and juicy grape leaves which were perfectly complimented by the sides of hommous and yogourt dips and wonderfully marinated tabbouleh. My lunch date's Kafta Kabob served over rice were reported to be savoury and satisfying too.

The sparsely decorated dining room features an ornate ceiling with a number of small two and four tops. The double doors at the front really  made a big difference in shielding out a lot (albeit not all) of the cold wind from the outside whenever someone entered or left."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken shawarma. Wait around 25 mins . It was quite cold when I got it. I asked the waitress to reheat it. We wait another 15 minutes and when I asked the waitress regarding my order she yelled at me saying that they are making it again for me as I wanted it hot ! Once I did get it back, it was still lukewarm.
The portion was small and the dish was tasteless. Exceptionally rude service ! They do get a lot of business from the local office goers and residents so taste and courtesy are not that important . Avoid !"}
{"text":"I give this place a high rating because I can actually eat here. I do like some of the creative menu items, some of the dips and salads are fantastic. Portions are quite generous and if you eat eggs the falafel's are pretty good.

Not a lot of staff there however the people that do work there aren't very happy, or quick. Don't go here in a rush.

We have ordered meat dishes before which I don't personally eat, but I have been told they are very good. 

There is an interesting chicken dish we ordered for our six-year-old one time that was breaded into some form of a sandwich it did look very good.

The food seems fresh, the sauces seem homemade, it doesn't seem as though things are prepackaged and left in the freezer forever to dry out.

If you like Mediterranean food with a definite flair for the Lebanese give this place a try."}
{"text":"Great Lebanese/mediterranean food in Calgary! I just moved here and was trying to find a restaurant for my hummus, Greek salad and kabob cravings; I found it! I will definitely come back here often.  Their hummus is sooo good!"}
{"text":"I really love Mediterranean food and so I was shocked to find Aida's Mediterranean Bistro had eluded me for years.  It's tucked away in an unassuming, quaint and cozy space in the heart of Mission's 4th street.  Because of the many options in the area it doesn't stand out visually.  What it lacks for in street appeal it more than makes up for in food and dining experience.

This is the type of place to bring a date, loved one, family members, out-of-towners and experience a more up-scale Mediterranean meal.  Aida's Bistro is on another level  compared to the usual fast-food shawarma/donair place that dots almost every Calgary inner-city corner.

We were here on a Saturday for lunch for my brother's birthday.  I had the shawarma platter and chose the babba ghannouj and fattoush salad to accompany it.  It was very very tasty.  The meat was cooked well and had enormous flavour.  The fattoush salad dressing had the perfect coating and the crunchy pita chips gave it nice texture and balance.  I was hungry so I ordered my platter with a side of roasted potatoes.  It was a really good addition to the meal.

The Turkish coffee here is the best I've ever had.  I don't have it much but this was the best brew as far as I can remember.  We had a minor mistake with my wife's dish as it was dressed with tahini, even though she disclosed her allergy to sesame when she ordered.  They quickly took it back and made her another one. We all had to wait a few minutes before starting (to be polite) but my wife was lucky for examining her food carefully before diving in.

Other than the minor mix-up in the kitchen, the service was prompt and they were very friendly."}
{"text":"It was a beautiful atmosphere and very kind servers however the food was very a subpar and the chicken tasted old."}
{"text":"Glad to see lots of people happy with Aida's, but for me that was the kwappiest experience not only in Calgary, but in all Canada so far. The only place where I literally wanted to leave the infamous 25 cents tip, and barely agreed with my wife to leave a dollar (still sorry about that).

Food was ok - not a big deal, but ok. Like, really - you can go to a roadside shawarma like Cedar's on the Edmonton Trail and get something at least as good, if not better! But this place had a restaurant tag, and even if it looked like a rathole (maintenance, guys, maintenance!) there still was an expectation to get something decent. Which just did not happen in our first and last visit.

The worst part was \"service\"... I don't know why that girl was so nasty, maybe it was just one of those days, but she literally was ignoring us and brought food for two other tables before even attempting to take our order. Than the order took like forever to arrive - and the food was as described above, plus cold. Than she never passed by to offer anything like a dessert, or whatever, and just duly brought up a bill. Man, and we did not do anything bad to her - been cheerful and friendly as always!

The number on the bill just did not make any sense, but to hesh with that, we were happy to simply pay it and bail out - what a place, man... And we were living literally around the corner, but never ever attempted to give that place another try."}
