{"text":"I recently ate here through a deal I found on Groupon for a 5-course tasting menu for two. I was really impressed with the ambience, service and food. The Raclette (scallops) were amazing....definitely the highlight of the meal. I also had the bison - really yummy and cooked perfectly (medium rare and tender). I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The food was decent, the service was pretty great! But I had a coupon from living social, it was $60 food but im only paying $30. If I have this coupon again I would come back, but if I don't I won't. The foods good but it's not really worth it's price."}
{"text":"Relatively new. Quiet place close to the new Opera House and Toronto Hilton Hotel. Menu has some interesting menu items. Everything nicely presented. Has lounge/bar area. Good service."}
{"text":"So, this was our second attempt at dinning at Forte Bistro. The week before we had a reservation, but when we got there the AC was broken and it was hotter inside than out. Obviously, that's not their fault, but what irritated me was when the hostess said they contacted everyone on the reservation list to notify them of the fact. No you didn't, but okay.   So, the following week we make another reservation and this time the AC is working. If it were just about the food this place would get four stars. My partner had the classic steak and fries, which he said was good, but not as good as The Keg, which, he added, is cheaper. I had the pork chop wrapped in cheese and ham. It was absolutely delicious. One suggestion: a little bit more potatoes and veggies would be nice. It felt like I was eating pure saturated fat for dinner with the meat wrapped in more meat as 80% of the meal. Anyway, on to the service. At first I thought it was nice that three different servers (one was the owner) were waiting on us, but after a while it became annoying. One would come and ask the same question that the other just had two minutes before.   On to the bill. We were charged $13 for a dessert port that was clearly priced at $10 in the dessert menu. I politely pointed this out to the hostess (who is also a server?) who argued with me until she finally looked up the price, came back, and said \"it must have rung in incorrectly\". Okay, that's fine. So she fixes it and brings us the new bill without saying a word. No \"sorry about that\" or even the usual \"thank you\". And when we left no one said a word to us. In fact, at 10pm the restaurant was empty while The Keg (which is across the street) was still packed. Not a good sign indeed. With all the other amazing high-end restaurants to visit in Toronto why would we return to Forte?"}
{"text":"I found Forte Bistro on groupon.com.  I was in Toronto for my honeymoon and wanted to go someplace nice.  This was the perfect place for us.  Due to some travel complications, we ended up eating there on the Saturday before Valentines day.  They had a special menu for a four course dinner for $80.  They gave my new wife a rose and we both had a complimentary glass of champagne.  The maitre d and servers were very friendly and the service was great.  We ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio, I will say it wasn't the best wine I had, lacked a bit in flavor. After we finished it though, they gave us a glass for our honeymoon, which thy picked out and it was very good(Guess I should have had them pick in the first place).  The Valentines menu was good, there were three items to choose form for each course.  The first course we each got Buffalo Carppacio and it was a great.  good sauce and the popcorn in truffle oil added some texture.  The second course, we each got a pasta dish.  I had Roasted Quail on some very long snake-like noodle.  The noodle was a bit big and I typically like things with alot of sauce, but I thought the quail was great.  Rose had penne with bacon, I can't remember what else, but it had more sauce in it and was wonderful.  My main dish was Duck Cassoulet.  This was great and the portion was very large.  The duck was prefect and so tender.  We both loved this the best.  Rose had lamb, which I am not fond of, but she liked it alot.  For dessert, I got the Lemon Tart, this is the one thing that I did not love, I thought there was too much crust and was a bit doughy.  Rose got a trio of chocolate that was absolutely amazing(I was going to order this, but we didn't want to get the same thing, we should have)  I have not had many fine dining experiences, but this one was great.  I don't like to spend that much and if this place was a bit cheaper, I would be back for sure the next time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"The only reason why this review is worth my time is to stop anybody else from going here. This was flat out the worse, overpriced meal I've had in Toronto. I did not choose to go here, I was with a party, but when we walked in on a Friday night and the place was empty we should have gotten the hint.  The service was awful as well. One of the guest had a glass of clearly corked wine and when they replaced it for her she was charged for both!  Stay clear of Forte!"}
{"text":"We hosted a small client party at Forte and everything was excellent. The servers and bartenders were friendly and helpful and the food was AMAZING. I am talking appetizers with delicious duck, and steak frites, which was thin slices of medium rare beef wrapped around a few french fries. HOLY $*&!! That was amazing! I could have eaten the entire plate.  I really have to get back here for a meal, because those tidbits of food were great."}
{"text":"I sat at the sushi bar after a long day and really enjoyed the nigiri the chef gave me.  He gave me a sampling of two kinds of salmon sashami - one fatty and the other not to show me the difference.  I enjoyed the company  and the sake was perfect, clear and dry.    The front dining area is more plush than the back sushi bar.  My suggestion would be to add more softness and color to the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly  Okay - over used headline, but appropriate for this review.  My wife and I are somewhat regular restaurant goers but 1st time visitors to Forte.  Were there last night for a tasting menu dinner and here is our feedback:  BAD.  Let's start with the BAD (not really bad, but needs improvement).  Place was definitely understaffed and staff seemed overwhelmed.  Got a half hearted welcome and were seated to our table.  Our server (who we later surmised was either the owner or manager) came over with menus - no 'welcome to Forte', no 'my name is So'n'So and i will be your server', not even a 'would you like to start with a cocktail'.  Overall service was pretty slow and server on few occasions mentioned how busy it was earlier in the evening and how tired he was.   GOOD.  The food.  The bison was just ever so slightly undercooked but had beautiful flavours;  the frites were smothered in salt.  Everything else was excellent - the vichyssoise, the scallops, and especially the french onion soup dumplings  (sans soup). All were very tasty.  Be prepared for small portion sizes but you will really enjoy the flavours.  Decor is somewhat eclectic but interesting.  Ugly. The website says free parking at the Hilton hotel.  When we presented our parking voucher prior to leaving we were informed that the restaurant no longer validated parking vouchers - that the parking fees had become too expensive and they could no longer afford to pay the hotel $10 per customers' vehicle.  When we reminded them that their website still indicates free parking their response was that they hadn't gotten around to having their website updated.  Incidentally, parking after 6:00 pm cost us only $6, not $10.  Oh yeah - a few annoying fruit flies hovering our table during dinner.  SUMMARY.  Great food but food alone does not make for a great restaurant.  Based on the overall dining experience we can't give Forte more than 3 out of five.  With some service and attitude improvements, a 4 rating is well within reach."}
{"text":"Absolutely impressed with the food and service provided! Had my bday dinner there with my good friend last week when she happened to have same day for her bday. She n I wanted to book for almost 20 ppl. so it was little hard to book when most of restaurants downtown just dont have the space or table available to accommodate that many people. We booked Mile Stones , then tried Earl's , then Bier Market. Finally I just went straight to Summer Licious list of restaurant and found this one. It has wide range of different of meats from rabbit to quil and frog legs. I figured its going to satisfy my friends whatever their needs are.   The place has very small door that doesnt make any impression on anything. I would have never noticed that place even I passed it so many times. But when you walk in, the place is really huge.  It's really a hidden gem.The receiption lady was super friendly, didnt ask me to put credit card on hold unlike BierMarket. She was very patient with me n my group of people when all the guests arrived. She had to go a lot of back and forth ordering but she was very good remembering who had what.   I had some soup dumpling thingys for appetizer they were delicious. For main course, I had black cod fish with mushroom crust on top, it was absolutely piece of haven of the creamy sauce it came with. The fish was cooked so tender it melts in your mouth, u can tell its fresh fish. There were some mussels came with the plate too, they were great.  My other friend ordered slow braised rabbit. It was very nice. I had a bite, i tasted like pulled pork.   Summerlicious is coming next week or two. I highly recogmend this place. There is bonus, they provide complimentary parking at Hilton Hotel parking lot if you hv meal there. The restaurant is right next door to Hilton Hotel."}
