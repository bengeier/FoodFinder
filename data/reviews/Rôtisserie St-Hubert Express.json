{"text":"Comida Franco Canadiense y Americana, bien ambiente y muy buena atención, poca variedad de vinos pero los que hay son buenos. Los platillos tienen un buen acabado y hay bastante variedad. No requiere reservación!!!"}
{"text":"Poor after sales service when ordering delivery. Took about 1 hr to resolve issue, and deliver missing items."}
{"text":"I am writing this review on behalf of my parents. They recently visited this St-Hubert location and very much enjoyed the food. In addition, the customer service here was truly exemplary - my mother forgot an expensive pair of sunglasses when leaving the table. Against all odds, the staff had found it and kept it for her until she returned the next day."}
{"text":"I mean, it's St-Hubert Express. For a fast food place, it's fine. I hate eating physically in the restaurant because it usually smells like sweat due to the other customers + the smell-absorbant, padded vinyl seats, but I get take out here on my way home all the time. The food and service here are pretty consistent and decently fast. If you're looking for fast food poutine, I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Worst service ever - very unpleasant dining experience. This local S-Hubert should be ashamed to try to overcharge the customer even before treating customers like inferiors."}
{"text":"Service is pretty fast, and the chicken legs are always well cooked. The meat is very moist and tender and full of flavor.  This restaurant does not offer any waiter service, so just bring your plate to the station after you're done."}
{"text":"What I like about this place is that it's fast service, clean, and comfortable. I don't usually go to normal St-Hubert's because I feel like their food is more appropriate for lunch time and I'm not about to go to a sit down St-Hubert for lunch.  I used to work in the building right next door so this was the most convenient place to get lunch. I loved getting my lunch here. It's cheap and delicious/filling. I would get a different kid's meal and it would fill me up for the whole day.   You get a main chicken meal (I usually got the nuggets or the wrap), fries or salad as a side, piece of bread (unlimited bread), the classic gravy sauce (unlimited sauce), and a fountain drink with refills.  Plus they have a person on the floor who will pick up your tray once you're done (most of the time). I usually just pick it up myself and bring it to the cleaning station but your choice.  The best deal I have ever seen at a ''fast food'' over the counter place."}
{"text":"Riez pas trop de moi parce que je fais une review du St-Hubert, okay? C'est parce que le mec qui m'a servie, Jonathan, il m'a TELLEMENT charmée! J'adore les serveurs qui ne se prennent pas au sérieux et qui sont capables de rire en travaillant. Pour vrai, je me ferais changer mon numéro de commande take-out n'importe quand par toi, mon Jo.   Pis la poule ben... c'est la poule! Et c'est express, c'était prêt en 3 minutes. T'sais quand t'as vraiment faim et un giga craving de poule, ça fait la job. Seul problème: frites tièdes. Une chance que j'avais demandé la poutine en accompagnement et que la sauce était turbo chaude. Ça a sauvé mon repas! Olé!"}
{"text":"Endroit à éviter! Il manque toujours quelque chose. Sois il n'ont plus de poulet ou sois il n'ont plus de salade de choux! Un st-hubert sans poulet ni poitrine ... Ça fait dure ! La sauce est au compte goûte pour ceux qui emporte le repas à la maison. Ils sont chanceux d'être encore en affaire ..."}
{"text":"I went to this St. Hubert Express for lunch with a friend since he wanted to eat somewhere that was fast and somewhat close to where he was working. He was treating me and I told him what I wanted as I went to the washroom to wash my hands.  The first thing that I want to comment on was that the washroom was somewhat clean for a restaurant. It wasn't the cleanest washroom that I've been in but it also wasn't the dirtiest.  When I finished washing my hands, my friend was still waiting for the order. I had told him that I wanted a Chicken Poutine with white meat only (extra charge) and a drink. I told me to pick a table and then when he got the order, he brought the tray to the table. Not wanting to leave my bag unattended, we took turns going to the self serve soft drink fountain and at the same time, my friend got some St-Hubert sauce from the sauce dispenser. He also wanted to get some ketchup from the ketchup dispenser but there wasn't any ketchup left in the dispenser when we showed up. I'm sure if we would have mentioned this at the cash, they would have sent someone there to refill it but my friend who had ordered a chicken breast, fries, bread, coleslaw, and a drink for himself was fine with just dipping his fries into the St-Hubert sauce.  The Chicken Poutine that I had was okay. It wasn't bad but it also wasn't great. What I found \"wrong\" with it was that the chunks of white meat were very large and the fries & sauce weren't hot by the time I started eating (which was shortly after I filled my drink from the soft drink dispenser). The fries were the thin fries somewhat similar in style to the McDonald's fries. Even though I didn't ask him to purchase it, my friend also bought me 2 coleslaws. I won't say that I'm a fan of coleslaw but I also don't dislike it so I found it to be good.  At this place, if your order came with bread, you get \"unlimited\" bread. You also get free refills at the soft drink dispenser and \"unlimited\" St-Hubert sauce for your chicken or fries. Since my friend didn't want the bread that came with his meal, he gave me his bread which I dipped into the St-Hubert sauce. I found it to be good but after eating my Chicken Poutine and 2 coleslaws, I was full. Before leaving, I refilled my drink.  This place has free WiFi and free parking. This place wasn't crowded at the time that my friend and I were there (Friday at ~1:00pm). There were plenty of tables available. After finishing the meal, patrons are supposed to put their dish(es) on the counter in the center of the restaurant for them to be cleaned/etc. When I went to put my dish on the counter, I noticed that there were maybe 10 dishes on the counter (and the restaurant was somewhat empty at the time) so the staff didn't seem to want to clean off the dishes or it wasn't a priority for them to do so.  They have something called the \"Chef's Choice\" which is a promotional special (chicken meal at a reduced price) but this is restricted to take out only. I don't understand why they do this or whether they would ask someone to leave if the restaurant wasn't crowded and the person decided to eat the \"Chef's Choice\" in the restaurant.  I rate this St-Hubert Express 3 stars."}
{"text":"Very tasty! Always love going to St-Hubert. The lady who served us was reaaaally nice. I absolutely love their food. Customer service A1 and the food is A1 as well."}
{"text":"It's probably silly to rate a fast food restaurant, but it was so bad I have to.   St-Hubert is an iconic Québécois brand so I had certain expectations. My first experience with St-Hubert was quite disappointing. I just don't understand how rôtisserie chicken can be that oily. Despite my first experience, I gave it a second chance with a piri piri chicken leg meal. This box of disappointment includes rubbery chicken, soggy fries, and a dry bun. The texture of the chicken was so rubbery and clunky that I didn't know what I was eating. The only good part was cole slaw. It's so sad when the place is known for chicken and cole slaw was better than their chicken. There will be no third time for me."}
{"text":"This St. Hubert is literally the worst I've ever been to. The customer service was absolute garbage. I took the time to order my food online a half hour before getting there. This is an express counter which means it should take less time than the restaurant - but I get there ready to pick up my food and what seemed to be the manager tells me that they just started cooking the meats because he told me he wanted it \"fresh\".   First of all, don't bullshit me and tell me you haven't started my order instead of lying about the freshness. We waited an extra 15 minutes for our food and then once we left in a hurry - they forgot to include my soup. I called back and demanded a delivery of the soup and I never got that delivery. Point is - WORST St. Hubert I had ever been to and WORST customer service.  You won't be getting my business anymore and if anyone ever asks me about you I'll tell them to go elsewhere. GARBAGE."}
{"text":"Do not order the Club sandwich. It barely has any bacon and the sauces are tasteless."}
{"text":"I ordered the fruit and goat cheese salad.  It left a lot to be desired, especially considering the 15$ it costs. I had to request dressing because it came out dry, and despite the large plate,  it was not very full. The toppings were interesting (dried fig), but they were all a little sparse. I walked out very unsatisfied.   On the plus side, service was great (friendly and prompt), but even it couldn't overcome the lackluster food. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Good, consistent quality, reliable. They forget things once in a while but nobody's perfect.   Favorite - the wings"}
{"text":"When you don't know what to eat, you can't go wrong with an old classic. St-Hubert always comes in to save the night."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the restaurant was fine. The workers were kind but I was disappointed throughout. It all started with the ant on the menu. I wish I could include a video. There was an alive ant on the menu. It was crawling over the appetizer section. My friend freaked out and destroyed it with a tissue. We were disgusted; however, gave the benefit of the doubt and still ordered our food. Although the waitress told us 30 mins, I had to wait on water that smelled like dirty laundry. This is a perfect explanation because it smelled precisely like dirty laundry. The night continued on and we finally got our food. It was decent, but generally a lot of the food was salty. I don't know about Quebecois people but it was WAY too salty for me. At the end, when we paid, I gave the waitress $50 for a $16.75 meal; however she gave me $15 back. I don't know if she got a general education in math but clearly she is not book smart. I did end up getting the proper amount of money, but I can't tell you how scared I was for this lady's future. I wish the restaurant well but I do NOT recommend. Be careful for the ants in the menu! Xoxoxxo"}
