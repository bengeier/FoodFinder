{"text":"- Love the layout and look of everything- bright, clean, open, modern, simple.  - Hubby and I went on a Friday morning for breakfast and the menu was simple yet sufficient.  - They gladly catered to our dietary/allergy needs- THANK YOU!  - The food was yummy & the service was great, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Marty's Market is such a great addition to the Strip.  I accidentally came across this place while looking for a parking spot a busy Saturday morning a few years ago and am so happy I did! It is a great health food market/ cafe/ coffee bar that serves and sells fresh, high quality food. The ambiance is bright, open and inviting which makes you want to pull up a seat at the coffee bar, order a latte and hang around for a while.   Their brunch menu is only served on the weekends from 9am - 3pm and is the perfect way to start your day in the Strip. Definitely ask to sit outside and dine \"al fresco\" if the weather is nice. They offer a lot of healthy, vegan and vegetarian options on their menus (lunch and brunch). When coming for brunch, recommend enjoying the Portuguese baked eggs with peppers and tomatoes, topped with parmesan cheese and served with a little salad and griddled bread."}
{"text":"I just moved away from Pittsburgh and I miss Marty's Market! Excellent brunch, great coffee, awesome beer selection and a good space to bring a laptop and stay awhile. Living in the Strip, I found myself at Marty's pretty much daily for groceries, or coffee, or food, or all of the above."}
{"text":"I have a love and hate relationship with Marty's Market. Marty's Dinner Menu:  I don't know what kind of people are saying it's low quality food.  That's a bold faced lie, maybe stop ordering just salads and put some real food in your gullet.  Learn how to order people!  On a whim, my bf and I practically ordered the entire menu: The compressed watermelon salad was to die for.  The pierogies, my god, the pierogies.  Order the short rib and poutine pierogies, for real.  If I could make sexy food sounds I would.  The hush puppies are incredible!  They have bits of pork belly and a delectable honey butter sauce to dip them in.  The combo of salty and sweet is what everyone wants!  In terms of sides, you cannot go wrong with the risotto, slightly cheesy with hints of rosemary.  Now I'm hungry, ugh. Marty's Market Cafe:  Eh.  I interacted with a male barista who I legit wanted to slap, not just once either.  I used to work as a barista.  When someone is cheery and smiling at you and trying to make conversation, that's when you smile back dude!!!!  But instead, everything I said was postulated by a snarky response from Mr. I Hate My Job.  True shame, when Kira worked here it was the greatest.  Anyway, the coffee is still good if you ignore Mister Droopy Drawers.  I love their seasonal lattes (they make all flavorings in house..none of that Torani garbage).  Also try their almond croissants; yes they are expensive, but they are delicious and well worth the hefty price tag (well technically they are La Gormandine's almond criossants, but if you aren't in Lawrenceville then this is the place to get them). Grocery:  They have groceries.  They also have great produce.  Interesting pottery (not my style really...quite common).   Butcher: You can always find great house made sausages here!  Great selection of meat that you won't find most places.  However, last time I went the \"butcher\" didn't know the difference between turkey and pastrami when I was getting my deli meat sliced.  I actually had to come around the counter and show him. Clearly I could write a book on Marty's because they have something for everyone.  4 stars because some of their new staff is rude and untrained."}
{"text":"Really like this place! The grocery items are competitively priced and they carry lots of interesting and hard to find items. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is what food is supposed to be.  If you are sick of greasy comfort food and you want to treat your body right, eat here.  The pumpkin pancakes are spectacular!"}
{"text":"So here's the deal.... This is a GREAT concept for a place, but the poor service and spotty food leave there a lot to be desired.  We arrived for brunch to eat in, and even though we had a reservation were not seated for 15min.  We placed our orders, including coffee.... It was at least 30 min before our coffees arrived, and they all came out at different times.  Then comes the food... It was hit and miss.  I had the Eggs Benedict, it was good but came with ZERO hollandaise sauce. When I asked for a side of it since it seemed to be missing, the server took 15 min to bring what was a tiny side ramekin filled halfway up.  Then we get the bill... and on it was a charge for a side of hollandaise for $1.50 - ridiculous.  Our server was really nice, albeit a bit flustered...  Hopefully they work the kinks out since this place has amazing potential."}
{"text":"Great place in Pittsburgh to score some healthier eats.  It's off the beaten path which was nice.  I only wish I would have made it in time to enjoy the cafe food which closed at 3pm.  The coffee bar is open longer and is a great place to take a break."}
{"text":"I would like to give Marty's Market a solid 3.5 star but will round up for the potential I see in this place. I ordered a latte which was good, not amazing but not bad either. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the friendly workers, the market itself is a nice place to browse and buy meats from. Samples too. The green quiche was a creative blend of greens and ham and interesting to the palate- not too bold. They have a Kenyan hot sauce everyone must try on their eggs- very spicy and delicious. Overall- I enjoy the originality of the place."}
{"text":"Review for cafe only:  Arrived for an impromptu brunch outing at 11 AM on a Saturday. Really impressed by the look of the market and cafe area. Great atmosphere and bright, airy environment with large potted plants, sleek modern design, and an open kitchen.  First impressions were all very good.  Service - We waited in line to be seated, admittedly behind a larger party. The tables in the cafe were just over half full at this point. Now, it could be that our party of two blended in with the group in front of us, but regardless, no one bothered to greet us. After what seemed like a few minutes, the larger group was seated. No one had yet to greet us after another four or fives minutes. Finally, a waitress asked us if we had been helped, and we replied, no we had not. She motioned vaguely to \"the guy in the orange shirt\" who was the host, and that he'd be over to help us shortly. Instead, we watched him deliver plates for a few minutes more. Understaffed? Maybe. But that's still no excuse for having us wait almost ten minutes to even be formally acknowledged. During this time, there were about four or five employees bustling about a work area immediately in front of us and adjacent to the front of the cafe. All seemed quite busy, and none found time to seat us during this time.  Finally, someone (not the host) realized how long our small party had been waiting, and came over to seat us. She began to seat us inside, but we asked for an outside table. She happily obliged and provided us with glasses, a bottle of water and menus.  After waiting a few more minutes, our server came over to greet us. She was super friendly, but seemed inexperienced and somewhat aloof.  Food - Great selection of items on a well-curated menu. A lot of vegetarian and vegan options, and the friendly offer on the bottom of the menu suggested that many items more could be made vegetarian or vegan, if desired. Ordered coffee, a spicy tomato juice (essentially a house-made bloody mary mix), and eggs benedict with salmon. My partner ordered the vegan sausage patties. The vegan sausage came with a side of toasted ciabatta, and both mains came with a side salad. The food and drink came promptly and was all excellent. Everything homemade and quite tasty. The eggs benedict featured eggs poached perfectly and a really delicious yet light hollandaise sauce. The side salads were of mixed greens and featured a very basic vinaigrette which was good, but might have benefited from a touch more flavor. The vegan sausage patties were quite well executed as well.   The coffee was really good - but not once was I offered a refill. Perhaps refills cost extra, but the offer was never made.  After we were over 2/3 down with eating, our server stopped by, noticed our toast, and suggested that she could bring us some complimentary jam to go with it. It was a very nice offer - and the jam really was quite good - but just odd that she didn't think to suggest this earlier. I'll stress again that she really was quite friendly - but overall impressions of her service were that she was a bit inexperienced.  After a particularly long stretch after our plates were cleared, we were just sitting at our table without any further visits from our waitress. We enjoyed the chance to relax in the nice weather outside. But after perhaps ten more minutes had passed, we decided that we had better be proactive and seek out our server for our check. She happily obliged and brought the check over.  The upshot - if judged on food and atmosphere alone, this place would get five stars. Factoring in the lackluster service, it gets three. Since reviews on Yelp complaining about the service date back to 2012, it's clearly an ongoing challenge for Marty's. I'll be back - probably in a month or two to see how things are going - but if the service is a repeat of today's experience, I'll probably not plan any future outings here."}
{"text":"This review is limited to their delicious brunch. The food is nothing fancy but does an excellent job of making quality delicious breakfast entrees."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with brunch--vegan sausage was too spicy, croissant french toast was lacking syrup/whipped cream, Greek omelet was too small, and offerings were overpriced."}
{"text":"Had read some great things about this market in the Strip District, went on a whim for breakfast last Friday and was totally jazzed by everything.  Love the super clean, modern/open yet vintage feel of the decor and overall design of the space.  The dining area has an open kitchen and a great space for counter seating.    I ordered the breakfast sandwich which comes with their mouthwatering bacon, fried egg, aged cheddar on an english muffin (and was only $5).  It was messy but absolutely spot on, not too salty or rich, though I guess you have to like all of those heavy components in the first place!  Cappuccino was hot, creamy and rich with flavor.    My server was genuinely friendly and super attentive.  There were a few small groups around me as well as families with teenagers and toddlers, and plenty of people reading or on their laptops like me.  Seems like a space good for anyone really.    Browsed the market after breakfast, decent selection of local/organic beers, cheeses, pastas, fresh veggies/ fruits.  My favorite part was the meat counter- choice, select cuts and all local.  In house made sausages too, I'll have to head back and buy when I have more time."}
{"text":"In Pittsburg for one day. We asked 3 different locals where to find some good clean organic food. All 3 times we got the same response...Marty's Market. The atmosphere is very wholefoodie but much more dine  in. The food was fantastic and the service was equally good.  If you ever find yourself in Pittsburg and wanting to eat some clean organic food I highly, highly recommend going to Marty's."}
{"text":"I tried to like this place as it is a local store and neatly decorated. The food is really bad, too salty, too buttery and lots of animal fat, and pricey for the quality. Also one time we ordered a fruit plate, that was like a joke!! I wish I took a picture of it! The fruit was not fresh, the portion was extremely underwhelming considering the price. I do NOT recommend eating there. It is over rates as healthy, unless you think eating derivatives of pork with egg is healthy and salty potatoes.  For the market section, since really rare people shops there most of the things in the vegetable and fruit sections are not fresh most of the time, they sit there a week! When you come home you might find your orange was dried out, or very expensive tomatoes are mushy inside, parsleys horrible, mushrooms are like sponge... I support eating organic but it would make sense if they are  fresh!  Since almost everything is organic in the store I was comfortably buying meat from there for long time. Couple times I had the some complaints, the meat was gone bad before I bring home, sitting out too long; same reason not much demand from shoppers. Same happened to me with the milk, yogurt and bulk nuts. The customer service is horrible, you might need to tell them 3 times and maybe you will get your money back! One time I see the price of my regular meat went up for 17$ from 13$, flat iron. I said why? They said this is non-GMO. Well good to know, then was I buying GMO the whole time?!!! Thank you for hiding and making me pay double price for a meat that I can find anywhere otherwise. If I forgot to mention their customer service is horrible, forget getting your money back, you will be treated like you are too small to ask your money back!! Really the only things worth buying there is potatoes because they are local and apples. The rest is huge disappointment. And trust me I can drive miles for non- gmo and organic food and willing to pay more, but not from here anymore. No fresh no good!  As I write, I remember the billion disappointments I had with the place, they validate your parking ticket but be sure it won't work 30% of the time, since they are mean people you won't feel like going back. I don't know if the staff is not paid enough or what, they are not helpful at all. I like seeing happy humble people, if you want arrogant and unhappy Marty's have more than you would ask for!"}
{"text":"Upgrading Marty's - have gone back and while service is still mediocre and somewhat slow, the food really is well prepared - and it's always fresh, seasonal and delicious. This would be a five if their service could catch up to the atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"Absolutely HORRIBLE service and food. I came with a group of people on Sunday morning. Despite being told it would be 30 minutes for a table, we had to wait well over an hour to be seated. We should have left when we considered it but thought we'd give it a go. Our service was impossibly slow. Our water glasses were never refilled. The food was lukewarm, at best. And my potatoes consisted of 3 small pieces of potato and the rest - charred black scraps from the bottom of the pan.  Nobody at our table was very impressed by their food but the bad food was overshadowed by the terrible service.  Save yourself money, time, and respect and go to one of the many other amazing restaurants in the Strip. My bet is that this place will not last very long."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, but a big miss on the food. I have had more negative experiences than positive. The only reason we come back is to sit outside with the puppy. For a breakfast place, they do not know the difference between undercooked, crispy and burnt bacon. When I asked the manager about the bacon - she responded that it is a \"preference\". I absolutely agree it is a preference just like over easy eggs vs. scrambled. Why can't I order crispy bacon with my over medium eggs?"}
{"text":"We usually go here for lunch. Their coffee is very good. They are typically pretty open so you do not have to wait too long for a table. I've never felt the service here was particularly good. Last time we went the experience was worse than usual. I ordered the shrimp tacos for $12. The plate came with two tacos harboring a total of 6 shrimp. My friend got the side salad with her sandwich, of which some of the lettuce was rotting. We pointed this out to the waitress but didn't receive much in the way of sympathy much less deduct anything off the bill. At least she could have brought a new salad. For two tacos, her sandwich and my coffee, grand total with tax and tip was almost $32. Way too much for the quality, quantity and service we received."}
{"text":"CAFE:  I loved the layout.. open to the outside, very inviting. The menu didn't have anything i was interested in. Not paying $3 for a tea. I eat gluten free (paleo) and there wasn't anything on there for me. Not to worry,   MEAT COUNTER: The beef was grain finished so that's a pass for me. I'm sure the quality is high, but I don't eat grain fed beef if I can help it.  Picked up a pork shoulder  at $3.50 a pound ($2 a pound at costco for CAFO) but it's pastured organic so it's actually a very good price when comparing apples to apples.  The meat was excellent quality and very generous size (18 pounds total, 2 shoulders), however I was disappointing that it was de-boned.  I'm going to talk to them about getting bone in BBQ cuts for the future, they were very open to working with me and very friendly.   I'm hopeful that this could be a place for me to buy local organic cuts for my BBQ.  GROCERY Didn't really give it a good look over.. but they have 3 or 4 aisles of food and a refrigerated section.  PRODUCE: Produce quality seemed good, but selection is limited. They aren't currently offering bulk produce, however they did seem open to the idea when I asked about it.  FINAL THOUGHTS In closing they have some potential. Staff was friendly and open to suggestions. They personally thanked me for supporting them and that means a lot to me.   To step up their game they need to offer some lunch specials in the correct price range, and would love to see some non-sandwich based items such as kabobs or BBQ ribs.  Right now the only reason I would go back is to possibly get some meat, but there are other options for that, so if they want to retain me they need to give me more reasons to go, like a good lunch special or meat sale."}
{"text":"This is exactly what downtown Pittsburgh has been needing. I have waited for something to fill the spot from Right by Nature. This place has all of my must products that I usually have to run around to get all of. Plus the cafe is wonderful. The prices are right on with other specialty store plus it is really close to the Northside so it officially closer than any of the others. Way to go on the design, and implemntation of this place. My new Saturday spot and quick dinner ingredient go to!"}
{"text":"Over the past few years I have always enjoyed weekend brunch at Marty's Market or a quick coffee. The food is yummy, classic brunch food! Sometimes I'll run in if I need a few small items from the market. So why the 5 star review now? BACON! Last week I got the house bacon from the meat counter. Whoa! The best EVER! The flavor is outstanding! It cooks nicely. The perfect crisp! YUM!"}
{"text":"With 2 hungry and tired 7 yr olds, and 1 hungry husband, I really wanted to go somewhere new. Being in the Strip, I knew I had eat at Marty's. After driving by, I decided to check Yelp for their business hours. \"Breakfast and Brunch\" is what it said. What? It was 6:38 and they *seemed* open. So I called them from the Yelp link.  Me: \"Hi, what time are you open until today?\" Marty's: \"We close our kitchen at 7:00\".  Me: (thinking oh great, this isn't an option). \"Oh, so I guess we are too late?\" Marty's: \"We still have 20 good minutes for cooking\". Me: \"Oh thank you! We'll be right in\".   Street parking was easy so we all headed inside. There we found the rather open eating area accentuated by open glass walls and sunlight streaming in. Smiles from everyone inside helped to ease my \"hurry up and order\" feelings.   The lovely women at the cash register helped the 4 of us to decide on ordering options. This was no easy task as the 2 children, who have rather sophisticated paletes, where not diggin' the food descriptions. And....one of them is a vegetarian and one allergic to milk products and has IBS.   Thinking our orders would be bagged for a ToGo order, I was quite surprised when we were shown to a table already set with filled water glasses and utensils in place for our meal. \"They are being really fantastic and it is closing time\" I thought. \"Perhaps they have us confused with somebody of importance?  No vacuums or sweeping around our feet or tables being restocked with condiments for the next day. No frowns or displeasure could be detected from the open kitchen. Nothing like that at all. In fact, you would have thought they just opened for the day.   After a total of about 10mins, all 4 meals were delivered to our table, piping hot and freshly made. Seemed nothing had been sitting under a warming light.  So now we get to the food:  Truth be told, there were mixed reviews. For myself, the homemade potato chips were pretty good. Perhaps a bit of salt and pepper or homemade horseradish/ranch type dressing would have made them fantastic. The Crispy Goat Cheese and Carmalized Onion Salad was genius! The blended flavors, including a vinaigrette dressing, textures and amount combined for a perfect 10! I can't seem to get that salad out of my mind. A true foodie love affair has begun here. I mistakenly over ordered and still had an entire BBQ sandwich sitting in front of me. Half went to the hubby, who thought it was awesome. I kept half, just to take a small bite mind you. I ate the entire half, sans the cheese, and agreed with the hubby.  The homemade pickles atop the BBQ are another genius culinary move. Only thing that could have made it better for this fire lovin' gal would have been fresh cut jalapenos.   My hubby's ordered meal, Parpadelle With Fresh Grilled Veggies, was good. A bit bland but good. That being said, the vegetarian 7yr.old loved it! This was a good thing because she didn't like her Bacon-less BLT sandwich because of the homemade mustard. By the way, hubby and I loved it and can't wait to order it as a complete BLT.  Child #2, who normally doesn't like pasta with tomato sauce because of IBS, LOVED her Spaghetti. The meatballs received an \"okay\" rating from her but were gobbled up by the hubby who gave his paata to 7yr old #1.  In the end, all plates were returned to the kitchen completely clear of food. If not by the orderer, by someone else at the table.  During the musical plates dinner, the service was invisibly impeccable. Meaning that waters were filled, plates cleared, extra napkins were provided and smiles present all without being a disruption to our mealtime interaction.  The only reason that I didn't give Marty's a 5th star is that I did not get to experience the grocery side.   I will be returning to try more menu items, check out the groceries and to continue my foodie love affair with my Goat Cheese Salad boyfriend.  By the way, I have a feeling we were not being mistaken for anyone of particular importance. Just Marty's Market's way of treating everyone as royalty."}
{"text":"I love the brunch here. The eggs Benedict is great. Casual atmosphere and fresh food make for a great place to relax any day if the week. The lunch is great too. When the weather is nice you can sit out on the patio or enjoy the breeze coming through the two garage style doors.   There is also a great coffee bar and grocery store here. This is the perfect place to start a nice Saturday in the strip!"}
{"text":"15$ for a coffee and an egg sandwich with bacon? If it wasn't for the friendly staff I would have given this place a lower score. Def not wasting my money here again"}
{"text":"I had the roast beef omelet, my wife had the Huevos Rancheros and our 2 year old had the pancake, fruit bowl and egg. Everything we had was delicious. Roast beef was perfectly cooked and the water cress gave the inlet a fresh pop. My wife won with the Huevos Rancheros. The egg was perfectly cooked and the chorizo had amazing flavor, and was not overpowered with spice. The coffee (drip and cold brew) was fantastic as well. If you live in the 'Burgh, or are just visiting, you need to hit up Marty's Market for breakfast."}
{"text":"Marty's is a go-to lunch and meeting place for me, as it is close to work.   On the plus side, the food is outstanding.  Fresh ingredients, great mix of sandwiches, salads, main courses, and brunch offerings.   Food is always well-prepared, portions are good, and while a bit on the less-healthy side (lots of mayo, cream sauces, etc.) it's a tasty treat.    Atmosphere is nice, although the truck traffic on Smallman St. makes outdoor dining a bit noisy during the summer months.     The biggest downside to Marty's is the service, which is just AWFUL.  The staff is friendly enough when they are engaged with you, but most seem as if they have never worked in a restaurant setting before.   They are slow, inattentive, can't get basic service elements right, and will leave you hanging waiting for initial order-taking or the check for far longer than is warranted.   The coffee bar, while serving outstanding (if a bit pricy) brews, including pour-overs, espresso drinks, etc., suffers from the same problem.  This isn't staff being hip and casual, this is service with a deer-in-the-headlights look. Marty's would easily get another \"star\" by hiring a real wait staff with some experience, and not the flaky group currently manning the tables."}
{"text":"Marty's market is always a OK in my book! They offer everything organic, free range, and grass fed. Of course it's more on the expensive side but you only get one body so you should care what goes into it.   They have a butcher on hand who cuts slabs of meat right in front of your eyes. They are very knowledgeable and will answer any questions you have!   The cafe is pretty nice too, they have a burger which is one of my top 5 in Pittsburgh. They also offer wine and beer as well! I believe breakfast is served all day so the menu is free game.   If you are in the area I recommend stopping here for an organic meal so you can taste the difference between real food and processed bullshit.   One thing I am a little upset about is that they got rid of their baker who made the delicious cookies and brownies nooooooo!   4 out of 5 stars for Marty's!"}
{"text":"If you hate whole foods but like the same type of products, this is a good alternative. It's industrial, well lit and the hipsters have caught on! Local honey there comes at a good value."}
{"text":"Great brunch and coffee.  Lots of fresh ingredients and the menu rotates a bit every few months.  The orange juice is fresh squeezed and well worth the price.    I've liked most everything on the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"I loved this cafe for the atmosphere. It's very minimal and clean, with lots of sunlight.  The food was decent - I had the eggs benedict with salmon. It wasn't otherworldly, but I left satisfied.   I think Marty's is worth a visit primarily for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the Friday after Thanksgiving to try for breakfast.  They actually had the weekend brunch menu on (I had planned to have the vegan breakfast sandwich from the weekday menu), so we were able to try a more extensive menu.  The vegan options are OK, but not extensive - vegan sausage (bit too bitter), cut fruit, potatoes and griddled bread (what we call toast in the rest of the world).  None of these blew me away, but it was reasonably filling. Might be nice to see vegan french toast or pancakes or something - there are still very few vegan options for breakfast in Pittsburgh, and the few good ones are only open at select times.   Oh well, at least they are trying.  And after, you can stroll down to the marketplace and check out the pasta shop and Gluten Free Goat Bakery for more vegan options."}
{"text":"Great space.  Had breakfast today.  Orange juice was the freshest I've had in along time.  Veggie omelet was prepared to perfection.  The breakfast sammich vegan was fantastic.  I will be back to support this market.  Can't wait to try something else."}
{"text":"Ugh. Just got back to town and decided to give Marty's Market another try on a Monday, for breakfast. Went in and stood for a few minutes and noticed one frantic server running around. It wasn't that busy but definitely too many tables for one person. She finally sat me, by telling me to take a seat at the breakfast counter. There were 2-top tables available and I thought about asking but decided against it to spare the poor woman even the slightest extra exchange. Her stress level was all over her face. I sat at the counter for awhile looking at a very messy steel table full of restaurant stuff that really shouldn't be showing, certainly not in that state of chaos. Looked around and saw lots of people with menus still on their table, so decided to just go get a coffee and maybe get something to eat if things slowed down a bit. Over at the coffee counter, I was shocked by what a mess it was. Then when I saw the Barista cleaning out the espresso apparatus by blowing into it, I had enough. Goodbye Marty's. Don't think I'll try again."}
{"text":"My brunch club decided to try this place out this past Sunday and I really thought it was just a gourmet grocery store. I am so glad to realize how wrong I was. The café inside was amazing! It was busy on a Sunday morning and glad we had reservations.  We waited a few minutes and were seated at a large wooden table-loved all of the room our party of 8 had.  It was a beautiful sunny day in Pittsburg and the café had their garage like doors open. I honestly felt like I was in a fancy café in New York City.  The menu isn't huge but they have a lot of tasty options.  I went with the breakfast sammie which included a French toast sandwich with bacon, fried egg and cheese. It was delicious!  I was still hungry afterwards and wished I had ordered more. They also have omelets, French toast (can get stuffed with cream cheese), pancakes, many egg options.  Also wish we knew that it is BYOB.  Will def. be visiting again."}
{"text":"Great breakfast dishes. Organic and local produce suppliers. Just a little long of a wait after we were seated because they seem short staffed. But it was made up for in great service afterwards."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch/ to look at the gluten free section of the market.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a large selection of gluten free options.  I ended up having the smoked chicken sandwich and salad.  It came out with just the right crunch to the gluten free bread, a slight melt to the muenster cheese and a very nice pairing of chicken, bacon, apple and greens.  I will probably be back in the next week to try something different."}
{"text":"Glad to see a new store move into this space.  The store was very clean, and the steaks at the meat counter looked terrific.  The space is very open...maybe a little too open on the grocery side of the store.  Anyway, I was there to eat lunch because of the inviting open garage doors and coffee bar with stools on the outside of the building.  I wasn't sure what to order, so asked for advice on whether I should order the Pulled Pork Sandwich or the BLT.  Ended up with the pulled pork, and was very pleased.  The sandwich was constructed on chibatta bread with pickles, cheese, and a sweet tomato based bbq sauce.  Homemade chips on the side.  The pickles seemed to be homemade and were delicious.  The cheese (can't recall which type) but really stood out without over powering the rest.  The pork was tender, and the bbq sauce was very good.  The chips were okay, not my favorite.  With all the hard surfaces in the store, it was relatively quite mostly because most tables were filled with one or two people and there weren't large groups.  The place needs some light dining/shopping music.  I really want a good pulled pork sandwich or any bbq in this city with a good carolina vinegar based bbq sauce instead of the tomato based.  I like Union Pig and Chicken's vinegar, but can get much better."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots.  Quality!  Cookies that rival Nancy B's...expensive but worth every penny.  Try the chicken/bacon/avocado sandwich.  It's 5 star worthy...comes with beet chips.  Love love the coffee bar here too."}
{"text":"YUM. My mom and I had gone to the History Center for the \"Pittsburgh Treasures\" event and were heading out of the Strip to go to one of my favorite brunch places, Coca Cafe. As we cruised down Smallman Street, we noticed the new market and glimpsed some table seating. I was curious to see what they had to offer and the lack of a line appealed to my grumbling tummy.   I got a free meter spot right out front and we walked in one of the open garage doors. The store is nicely arranged and the cafe area is airy and inviting. The menu looked good and the prices not unreasonable for similar type places. I ordered the sweet polenta with dried fruit and slivered almonds and, because my eyes were bigger than my stomach, a side of eggs over easy with some potatoes. My mom went with the brioche french toast with cinnamon butter and maple syrup. I had a few bites of hers and it was nicely done and very tasty. I loved my polenta. I'm not sure exactly how they made it, but it had a distinct cinnamon flavor and what I thought was a taste of orange. It was sweet, but not too sweet, so the fruit was just the perfect addition and not too much. The eggs and potatoes were perfectly fine, though I think they could season up the potatoes a bit more. The coffee was drinkable, which is saying a lot coming from me. Mom had tea which appeared to come in a hand-filled tea bag. They lose huge points for serving it with a hot cup of water rather than a lidded pot to avoid heat loss. She was away from the table when it arrived, so I promptly put the bag in the water and used the saucer for a lid. Mom, nonetheless thought it was a good cup of tea, so that's the important point.   The woman who took our order at the cash register was very friendly and pleasant and the subsequent table service was good. I will definitely come back here when I find myself hungry in the Strip.   We did wander into the store to see what they had to offer, and I echo the sentiments I've read from others--extremely overpriced and limited selection. I don't shop at Whole Foods, but if they're not beating their prices then that's a serious problem. I did note that they had a lot of gluten free products, which might be a reason to go if you'd like a wider variety of options than you may find elsewhere. There were a number of interesting items that I haven't seen elsewhere, but I would never do any \"regular\" shopping here. They may do well to focus nearly exclusively on unique specialty products that other similar groceries don't carry, or lower some of their prices for more staple options."}
{"text":"What a joint, a fun time, great cafe, seriously good food, staff so friendly,helpful.  Yes, walked in for a Sun brunch,short wait for a table.  Did not stand in line outside. Explored a small eclectic  market, fantastic meat counter for sure, again staff very  friendly.  Food is excellent, all fresh. Well worth the wait. Yes, service was slow but well done. Love going out with family & friends...but so frustrating to be interrupted  every 2 minutes by a server and pay more for food not as good, at prices higher because  of a view ? This place a gem!"}
{"text":"Café review:  First time eating at MM. A friend and I shared the French toast and a Peruvian dish of peppers, exotic spices and a cheese cap (not quite sure what cheese, perhaps mozzarella). Disparate choices, I know, but my friend was treating, so I wasn't going to object. The food was a bit slow to arrive, but my friend and I weren't in a rush.    I'm predominantly on the Paleo diet, but allow for treats such as butter and real bread every now and then. The bread carried the batter well-- soft enough to be cut with only a fork, but not at all mushy. The syrup and butter were properly proportioned as well. There were a total of two slices of toast, both halved. While it's some of the best French toast I've had, there was nothing so mind-blowing about it to warrant a price tag of $8. That said, MM is known for quality, seasonal, local, organic ingredients; I'm willing to shell out a couple of dollars more knowing this. The Peruvian dish, whose name and specific ingredients escape me (it's not up on their website right now) was tasty as well. There was a small serving of greens and some delicious artisan bread accompanying the red, saucy dish. I believe this was $8, too, and lacking any meat protein, I again find this price to be a bit on the steep side. I'm not sure if it was French press or not, but I had three cups of some of the best hot coffee in Pittsburgh. (Big Dog in the South Side still takes the cake in my book. They brew Intelligentsia.)   The service was prompt and friendly. I love the layout and location of MM. It was a warm, sunny morning. There weren't too many empty tables in the café area, but it wasn't crowded or noisy. If I find myself in the Strip District for a quick breakfast, brunch, or lunch, I would give MM serious consideration."}
{"text":"I have done small shopping trips and had lunch here before but now I'm writing a review about it.   They are always changing the place and I would say for the better. Always a few new items or what's in season. But this change is to the restaurant.   First time I went I had the chicken Cesar salad as I say at there nice out door area. This time I had he beef heart Ruben. The perfect size for lunch and with salty yummy beef heart. It was not just a good Ruben but also a nice change to it. I picked the mixed greens salad as my side. It was a little under dressed but still good. The service was fast and on point and I would recommend going for a nice organic lunch that won't over stuff you but not leave you hungry."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a lunchtime visit after reading many good reviews. I had a salad and my husband had the banh mi. It was good and fresh but not particularly flavorful in the way you would expect. The cappuccino we both had was very good. My only complaint is that service was very slow and inattentive. We waited for our check much longer that I would have liked. The market itself was really neat and we picked up some unique finds."}
{"text":"I think Marty's is great. It's a beautiful, bright, open health food market and a sweet little cafe in one. The menu is an interesting one, and while some of the items are familiar, they play around with flavors and always put their own twist on things. I am partial to the baked eggs -- yum!  The space, as I mentioned, is quite large and quite light-filled. The produce is gorgeous -- if I lived in the area, I doubt I'd go anywhere else for my apples, lettuce and cucumbers!   There's also quite a nice variety of dry goods, and most everything is organic and a little on the pricy side.   While I didn't check out the meat shop, I am told it's pretty great, just like the rest of Marty's. Definitely check them out for breakfast/brunch, and don't forget to order the fresh-squeezed orange juice!"}
{"text":"A specialty food store with over priced apples! Jaja I spent 1.37 for an apple! What! That was crazy! The apple was crisp and sweet. The location is clean and organized. They also serve food but the time varies. Cute place over all. Also it's location is cute!"}
{"text":"Marty's Market has vegan and gluten free options available, though slightly limited if you are looking for both. The hummus veggie sandwich on gluten free bread was delicious, but easily something you could make yourself. The ketchup and side of fries was the real winner here!"}
{"text":"Second visit and still unimpressed. I really want to like this place, but after my second attempt I most likely won't return. The staff always seems disorganized and my coffee/food was cold both times. Great concept... poor execution."}
{"text":"This review is more about the cafe than the actual market, which I find to be a bit pricey but worth it for the quality. If you want to try the market...I say go for it! The cafe is another story. After shopping at the market a few times, I've always wanted to sit down and try the cafe. The menu looked tasty and it's BYOB!I went for an earlyish brunch on a Sunday - around 11AM. The weather was questionable and the place was not very busy, yet the service was horribly slow. None of the staff seemed very interested in doing anything in a timely fashion despite only having a few tables between them. I ordered tea to start with, and I watched it sit on the counter for close to 15 minutes before being brought to me. It was already cold when I finally got it. When I politely asked if there was a way they could warm it up I was rudely told \"no\" by the pretentious barista (who like everyone else had no other customers at the time). Now if I'm going to pay $4 for a basic cup of tea, I want it to at least be hot. About 40 minutes after ordering, we receive our (also not hot) meals. The french toast was delicious, as were the potatoes. Would have probably been better hot though. The fresh squeezed OJ was a hit too. After all of that venting I will close with this, the food here is a bit overpriced but decent. However, the staff was generally pretentious, inattentive, and very slow. It seemed like they took no pride in the food or the place itself, and were too busy socializing with each other to care about their customers. I would have definitely returned here if it weren't for the very poor service. It's unfortunate because in general I really like the market, but I will not be returning to the cafe. Pittsburgh has a great food scene. If you want to set yourselves a part, do so with good service."}
{"text":"I LOVE MARTYS! This place is a favorite to come buy my groceries from!! The meat selection is fantastic!! They are so creative with the things they butcher!!! My mouth waters every time I think about it. The selection is outstanding with the organic options and vegan etc.. You can also purchase beer to go as well which is a giant plus!!! I've never been to the bar side but I have heard the Bloody Mary's are out of this world!! MARTYS is an awesome place that I would recommend everyone go to"}
{"text":"This review is just for the coffee bar...  ...and it's good. Real good. They carry Coava coffee from Portland, which doesn't get enough love on the East Coast. It's excellent stuff that is a tad cheaper than other high quality beans you can find in Pittsburgh (Counter Culture, Intelligentsia, Ritual). Also, they do coffee tastings every other Saturday which seem fun, but I haven't made it to one yet. On my Pittsburgh to-do list!"}
{"text":"Meh. For now, this place underwhelms me.  We stopped in one Saturday early afternoon to grab some more of the amazing Kenyan hot sauce they sell.  We went through a full bottle in less than a month. I put that stuff on EVERYTHING as well as carry one with me in my purse. Yes. It is hat good and I highly recommend having some in your kitchen/purse/desk at work.  I felt an iced chai tea latte would be the only thing to cure my hangover that day and instead I got a stuffy baristo that poured me a straight glass of $5 ice milk.  I watched him make my drink and could clearly see their chai mixture had just too little to make a drink.  Instead of letting me know this and suggesting/offering that I order something else, he tried to cover it up by diluting it with milk.  Bobby was having conversation with the man behind the meat/cheese counter who was explaining and letting him sample different slices of deli products.  The layout of the place is open, bright and well-stocked with a bunch of different items from ingredients to organic products you can eat right out of the bag.  My parents ate here before, but I don't recall them saying anything memorable about their experience.  Three stars based on their hot sauce and layout, product and man behind the deli counter.  I will be more inclined to update my review if I ever have a reason to go back and eat, but there are far more appealing options in the area for me to stop and get a meal."}
{"text":"A couple of great things to check out are the bulk spices.  You can really get some wonderful deals hear, and you are not paying a lot for the packaging.  I love that the spices are housed in an antique card catalog.  The other thing that is special is the cheese counter.  You can get some really excellent local artisan cheeses at Marty's.  I think where Marty's excels is in their Cafe.  Really excellent food at very reasonable prices.  They have a creative menu and food you can rave about.  There are also lots of special events and classes at Marty's, make sure you get on their mailing list of check their calendar."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday morning for breakfast with a group of 7. We were seated promptly and served coffee while we waited for all members of the group to arrive. [bonus that there was a Yelp check in $1 off coffee coupon]   The waiter was very nice and prompt suggesting his favorites from the menu. I asked for the Eggs Benedict with both Canadian bacon and Spinach [Canadian florentine]. I was thrilled with the texture, the only complaint is a personal taste for a little bit less salt. [again, that's just me]  I was delighted the with house vinaigrette, just enough for the mixed greens. It was nice that we were allowed to eat grazingly as my group has a habit of 2-3 hour breakfasts.  All together it was delightful and I will gladly visit again."}
{"text":"After watching Steve the butcher give a demo at Hometown Homegrown, I quickly became enamored of this place. It's since become my favorite place to buy meat. The cuts are fresher than I've gotten anywhere else, and what's more, I know that I'm a) putting money in the pocket of a local rancher, and b) avoiding loading up my body with mystery hormones. It might be a few bucks more, but the quality is absolutely worth it. The butchers will also happily help you choose the cut that meets your needs, and helpfully explain why.  As for the rest of the store -- I'll be honest, I go there for the meat and usually just pick up a few odds and ends that catch my eye. Often from their wide variety of artisanal chocolates!  Even if you only go for the butcher shop, though, it's worth the trip -- and the occasional street parking hassle."}
{"text":"I have visited Marty's Market on and off for the past year or so. If I ever want a unique and delicious sausage- this is where I go. Their selection changes often, but is always unique and delicious. Last time I purchased, I ordered an Asian inspired sausage with pork, cilantro, and other Asian flavors, as well as the \"thanksgiving\" sausage that consisted of turkey, potatoes, some fresh herbs, carrots and gravy. The thanksgiving one was insanely delicious, the Asian one was as well. The market itself isn't very large. That being said, they have all of the staples you might need (bread, eggs, pasta, etc) and a decent produce selection, most of which is organic. Most recently, I purchased a container of fresh organic alfalfa sprouts- at $2.50 it wasn't a bad price. They have tons of items that are local- from pretzels, pickles to ice cream. The market is definitely worth checking out.  Yesterday was the first time that I visited the café. There were 9 of us and I called about an hour ahead to reserve a table. They are on the \"no wait\" app, which made the process very easy. Service was good. Nothing super memorable but it was a positive experience and she separated our checks like a pro. I ordered two of the alcoholic beverages- the Pomegranate Peach Bellini and the Marty's Bloody Mary. The Pomegranate Peach Bellini was light, refreshing and delicious. The Marty's Bloody Mary was very good as well- although the beef stick was a little too chewy for me. It was a nice addition to the drink, though. Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time and all of our orders were correct (which is always a good thing with a big party of people). I ordered the French toast sandwich. I knew from reading the description that it wasn't going to be actual French toast, but I was hoping it was going to have something a little more special about it. It was not very big, but it was filling. The bacon was really good- clearly fresh and it had an awesome flavor to it. The caramelized onions were weird. It seemed like they were either from some type of jar or were caramelized a few days before.. just didn't sit right or really go with the other flavors. The maple aioli was very good, although I do wish that the maple/cinnamon/sugar flavors were more present overall. Although this sandwich wasn't bad, I wouldn't order it if I visited again. I did try three other dishes that my friends had (one perk of going with a large group). The biscuits & gravy were tasty- the biscuit was crispy yet fluffy and the gravy had a delicious homemade taste to it. My friend loved it. The crab cake was really good- the apple, cucumber & pomegranates really added something unique to the dish & the crab cake tasted fresh. The shrimp & grits was incredible- I think that will be what I get next time. My boyfriend got the chicken sandwich and wasn't really impressed. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals.   Overall, we had a positive experience and I would definitely return (for groceries and for a meal).   *They validate parking (up to 2 hours) in the garage above the market!"}
{"text":"Marty's always has exactly what I need!  Such a cool gentrified vibe (in a good way!).  Talk to the meat counter to watch the butcher process or just to talk meat.  Super knowledgeable."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for brunch and were very pleased with our experience. The prices were reasonable and the staff were quick and polite. The drinks were great - good beer selection and the lattes were perfect.  We highly recommend the croissant French toast and chicken and waffles, and hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Very small restaurant which can mean a wait for a table to open, but just grab a coffee from the coffee bar and wait the extra five minutes. Every time I go I order the breakfast sammich, its the best in Pittsburgh. However, Last time I went there it was not on the menu. BRING BACK THE BREAKFAST SAMMICH!!!!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this find in the Strip district. The staff was welcoming and nice when we first got there. Unfortunately there appeared to be multiple reservations for Sunday morning breakfast (we got there at around 9:30) because despite empty tables there weren't any available so we sat at the bar.   I ended up getting the shrimp and grits with a side of grill toasted bread. The shrimp was very nicely cooked, peeled and alone had a simple flavor, which really enabled the grits flavor to come out. Mushrooms and thick cut pork were also mixed into the grits, adding some nice texture and flavor. The consistency of the grits was not too thick nor liquidy. Having the toast was a needed additive especially because it helped me mop up all the grit sauciness. I usually like buttered toast, but I felt that the toast was a bit overly buttered.   I also had the coffee julep which was a nice combination of mint and coffee in a slush of ice. Great drink to have on the side but I could only have it in sips and not as a morning pick-me-up.   The atmosphere was very interesting in that they have a bar in the center surrounded by the main restaurant tables and a cafe on the opposite side of the kitchen where all the coffee orders go. The interior is like a warehouse almost so the market portion is clearly visible. Definitely check out the market because they have some cool items on their shelves."}
{"text":"Ah.. nothing like the joy of serendipitously discovering good new food joints! Stopped here on our way home from the strip and boy were we glad. Since they were still in their soft-opening the groceries weren't stocked and the menu options were limited.. did try their potato leek soup - hearty and super tasty!  Although their primary theme is that they will be selling locally-sourced organic produce, dairy, meat & specialty foods; it'll be unfair to call this place just another grocery store. With an industrial, loft-like setting it's a hybrid of a Whole Foods + a coffee bar + a casual & fresh cafe.    Watch this space for more updates as I have a vibe that I'll be visiting here quite often."}
{"text":"This review is really just for the cafe, I didn't venture afterwards to the store part or coffee bar.  It's a nice, simple, clean set up they have.  Both indoor and out (they appear to be dog friendly on the patio/deck thing they have).  Simple tables and chairs, some high, some low.  Open area, no real separation from the store, and it was bright, so bright you may have needed your sunglasses indoors.  There was a mix of food brought to the table.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to try it all, but what I did sample was amazing.  I had a grilled chicken sandwich and some of their homemade potato chips.  Also on the table was smoked turkey sandwiches, fresh made hummus with homemade pita chips and a barley salad.    Another nice little touch they have here is a person plays the piano.  It's no overhead typical radio songs drowning out the conversation.  It's a real live person playing songs you would have never thought to have heard come from a piano.  And it kind of makes you feel old when you hear something like Boyz II Men played on a piano."}
{"text":"I'm so happy they have dinner now! Their brunch is fantastic, and their dinner menu lives up to it, with lots of local, seasonal ingredients and unique recipes. I could live happily on the cous cous mac and cheese.   The market is good for specialty foodie items,  but a little too pricey for staples."}
{"text":"We entertained some out of town guests here this morning for breakfast. Our friends appreciated the vegetarian options and took advantage of the in-house grocery to pick up some healthy snacks for their toddler.   I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Canadian Bacon. The egg was cooked to perfection. However, it was lacking in the bacon department. I wasn't expecting a pile of ham, but I don't even think there was even 1 oz worth. It was probably the equivalent to one slice of standard bacon split between two halves of a English muffin. Kind of weak especially when you know traditional Eggs Benedict has a nice thick slice of good ham.  The meal was served with a side of bibb lettuce leaves with a light and refreshing dressing. It was tasty and I had no problem eating all of it to get more of that dressing! So good.  In all, I'd definitely come back again for breakfast and I'd also love to to try their regular lunch/dinner menu."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times for breakfast and never disappointed. Last night I ventured there for dinner and was amazed.  Go there for dinner and try everything. I would put that meal against place I've ever been."}
{"text":"Had a quick fly-by experience at Marty's through the coffee bar. Just grabbed a regular drip coffee, from which I got a deal by checking in on yelp! Quick, friendly service, parking is a little bit of a pain as there is no lot but I was in and out quickly.  Update: So sad to see that they closed!"}
{"text":"As an AirBnB host we struggle sometimes to give breakfast recommendations out to our guests. Sure we want to send them to Pamela's or Coca for the best taste of what the 'Burgh has to offer, but then you have to explain to them all about the potential waits, when to get there, how to phone in a table, etc.   Along game Marty's and saved us from all that hassle [for now, until you all read this and ruin our good thing]. We've sent so many satisfied guests to Marty's that it's now our only recommendation.   Of course, we love it ourselves too. The breakfast and lunch menus are simple, short, and tasty. There's usually enough variety for everyone and they stick to what I would consider a just-enough philosophy: you'll always leave full, but never stuffed. That's a good thing, everybody.  Their ham omelet for breakfast is a household favorite. The griddle bread is amazing and the potatoes are flavorful and crispy. Get a fresh 'green' juice while your at it and add some years onto your life!"}
{"text":"Hubs didn't get what he wanted to try because they were out, but eggs benedict with salmon.... devine! Also the coffee and tea were mighty fresh. We will be back."}
{"text":"Marty's Market has always been a place of awe for me.  It's too expensive for me to take myself to, but in the past few months, I've been here quite a few times.  I like Marty's.  First, the store portion has all sorts of cool things.  They range from cheeses and meats to healthy versions of lots of things.  It's fun to walk through the store.  Over the summer, I got an iced coffee here and sat at the bar outside.  On a nice day, I love outdoor seating, and it's partially covered.  So you aren't being directly exposed to the sun.  The coffee was good.  Better than a Starbucks or other chain for sure.  The cafe is one of my favorite eating options in the Strip District.  My first trip here I ordered the pasture-raised-non-GMO burger ($10).  It was a delicious mixture of things on top of the burger.  I really don't know what was on it because they changed the toppings seasonly.  There was some kind of leafy product... possibly arugula.  And a fancy cheese.  Look.  If you are thinking about the burger, get it.  The second trip I ordered the macaroni and cheese ($11).    Per the menu, it had fromager d'affinois, asiago fresco, white cheddar, organic shallot, cream, bacon, and herb.  It was amazingly delicious, and that's what matters. The portion was a decent size.  I was full after both meals.  The service isn't always fast, but it's friendly.  This place can get crowded at lunch time so be prepared to wait or go elsewhere.  But it's worth it.  The prices might be higher than I can manage, but Marty's Market is a wonderful treat."}
{"text":"Here is a tip for everyone: Marty's Market has a restaurant inside.  The restaurant is not seat your self!   Oops!!  I arranged to meet my friend for lunch.  I entered through the market door and walked around the aisles a bit.  I walked over to a table in the back of the restaurant and sat down.  After about 3 minutes a server came over and asked if I \"needed something.\"  \"Oh I'm waiting for a friend and we are going to order some lunch.\"  I was thinking once she got there we would make our way to the counter to eat, but then the waiter brought me a menu and water.  I realized there was a \"Please wait to be seated\" sign by the other entrance. Oops!  Well, not off to the best start.  The waiter teased me a bit about it, and I was a bit embarrassed.   They have a nice cafe.  I got a latte and it was quite good.  I also ordered a salad with beets and goat cheese which was pretty standard, but yummy.  I liked the fresh veggies.  The prices are a tad higher, but you are getting the whole \"farm to fork\" experience."}
{"text":"I may have a slight addiction to Marty's Market... But please, let me explain. You'll totally understand!  I've been to Marty's a handful of times in the past, but I started really going in earnest about a month ago. My husband and I decided to embark upon a week-long Buy Fresh Buy Local Challenge to see if we could make about 75% of our meals for the week from locally-sourced ingredients (or at least locally-purchased, to support small business even if it was for items that weren't made nearby).  So, I bought almost all of our meat and a good bit of our produce from Marty's. And I haven't looked back.  Their produce section is locally-sourced, and they tell you where each onion, potato, and peach was born and raised. Many of these items were from the farms we see in our Penn's Corner CSA farm share each week, so it was no surprise to see familiar names like Clarion River Organics and Brenckle's Farm. The prices are higher than you'd see at a big store like Giant Eagle or Shop n Save, but you know exactly where you're getting your freggies from, and exactly what they've experienced in their little freggie lives.  Speaking of knowing where your food is from, I would be remiss if I didn't talk about the amazing meat selection at Marty's! This is where we really fell in love with the store at first. They do their own butchering on site and use only locally, humanely-raised animals. (We saw butcher Steve do a demonstration at Hometown Homegrown with Oliver from Northwoods Ranch.)  Yes, the meat is more expensive than that BOGO deal you may get at Giant Eagle. But trust me when I say this: it tastes better. It really does. First of all, you won't waste ten minutes of kitchen prep slicing off the fat, because the pieces of meat you receive are what - and only what - you want. If you want fat, you can get it. But if you don't? No worries. The meat is ready for you.  We're in love with their pork belly, which I have used in a variety of cooking capacities. I've also bought their deli meat, and we are big fans of their flank and hanger steaks, as well as their fresh chicken breasts. And best of all, we know where these animals came from, and we know they were raised humanely and had excellent lives before graciously giving themselves up for our nourishment. Buying meat from Marty's helps to bridge the gap between 'I think humans are supposed to have some meat in our diets' and 'but OMGZ I love the animals.'  Finally, I need to mention the staff. Top. Notch. You can come in with a cooking question of any sort and find an answer to it. The butchers are so knowledgeable about the meat, and they definitely want to share what they know. And the other staff have been so helpful when I'm stuck with a cooking ingredient question. (Since the produce is seasonal, I find myself having to make substitutions at times, and I've always been able to get great help from the staff with this.)  Long story short, I've committed to taking a few extra dollars out of my bank account to put it toward better nourishing my body. And that means buying local and organic products, and that absolutely means shopping at Marty's every week! Check it out, and maybe you'll make the switch to Buy Fresh Buy Local as well!"}
{"text":"I really wish that I could give this place a better rating, but on all of the occasions that I have been there, nothing has stood out to me really.  We only seem to stop here out of convenience and now that the Market St Grocery has opened downtown, I see myself not needing this convenience any longer even though it is closer to my house.   This is a great niche market I would have to say, but I think that they would be better off if they could do a good job of appealing to more people who would be willing to spend their money there.  The limited selection, inflated prices on some items and lack of truly fresh produce leaves little to be desired.  The saving grace here is that they are open a little later than other places in the Strip.    I believe that they are adding some beers and cocktails to the cafe, and going to start selling beer, so that could be a bonus for some people.  It is not enough to lure me in though."}
{"text":"If you are in The Strip, you have a plethora of grocery options at your fingertips. Marty's Market would be my last choice because they only have a small selection of random things, and a lot of empty space. They do not specialize in anything in particular (except maybe overpriced \"health foods\") and they have less vegan and/or local foods than one would expect from this type of store. I most recently stopped in hoping for some fresh baked goods, but they do not have a bakery or sell local baked goods, except bread. Even the in-store coffee shop did not have any of the usual accompaniments (you know, muffins, cookies, scones etc.). So with all the other coffee shops and specialty markets around, I don't see how Marty's adds anything special to the area. The customer service seems to be great but that's not enough for me to waste my time looking at the typical packaged natural food items here when I could be finding unique buys at other nearby retailers."}
{"text":"I visited Marty's Market for the first time today for birthday brunch with a friend.  When we decided to do brunch, I thought of Marty's because my friend is a GF eater, and Marty's caters to special dietary needs.  Brunch can be challenging for the GF crowd, so I was happy to find a place that would accommodate her dietary needs with offerings that suited my palate as well.  Upon arrival at 11am, all of the tables were occupied, so we decided to sit at the bar rather than wait.  Although the hostess gave us menus as we sat down, we waited for at least 10 min. before the older woman working behind the bar asked us for our order.  By then, we'd decided on drinks and entrees, so we put our entire order in at once.  However, our order taker had some difficulty grasping how we wanted the check to be split (drinks on one check, food on another--how hard is that?), so we had to clarify before our orders were fulfilled.  Since it's my birthday, I had to indulge in a drink, so I chose the pomegranate peach bellini ($8).  Having never had a standard peach bellini before, I can't directly compare this drink to one.   However, I can say that the pomegranate version was delicious, and had a great sweet-sour balance.  It was clear it was made with freshly squeezed juices, too.  For my entree, I ordered the croissant French toast ($11), which consisted of maple bourbon spiced apples with brown sugar and cinnamon and candied walnuts over a toasted croissant.  While I liked the croissant idea in theory, in practice, it was a bit too far removed from French toast to be labeled as such IMO.  While the flavors of the ingredients were complementary, they didn't really marry together as much as I'd have liked.  The toppings were unevenly distributed even after I cut up the croissant and moved them around in an attempt to more evenly distribute them.  Since I didn't try my friend's entree, the chicken taco omelette ($11), I can't review it other than to say that she enjoyed it.  Overall, I found the brunch at Marty's decent but not memorable.  While my drink was delicious, my entree left a few things to be desired.  The bigger issue, though, is the service, between the slow start and never seeing our order taker again until she finally dropped off the check (after at least 10 min. of waiting--again).  If Marty's could get their act together service-wise, I'd be willing to upgrade to 4 stars.  For the time being, however, 3.5 stars it is."}
{"text":"I have an issue with the service at Marty's. The food is great, the prices are what they are, but the service is terrible. Every time I go to Marty's I find that the employees are unhelpful, terse, and rude. The business should do itself a favor and hire people who at least act like they want to be there."}
{"text":"A great spot for breakfast. Very vegetarian friendly if you have a vegetarian in your group. I don't eat what I call \"over the counter\" breakfast meat because I have reactions to the sodium nitrate found in most packaged sausage, bacon, and ham. However, here, I can eat the sausage because it is all natural. Good stuff.   Another bonus to having breakfast here is if you spend $30 then you get free parking in Marty's garage. Considering how hard it is to park in the Strip District, this perk is a huge benefit.   The store itself is all organic and they have a little bit of everything.   The space itself feels very modern, open, and clean."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs for brunch. Understaffed, bad service, limited menu. This is the kind of place where they will have five tables waiting to be cleared and 15 people milling around waiting to be seated. These people wait for another 30 minutes before they seated.   We ordered drinks (specifically, cans of beer), and it took for a good 20 minutes to bring them.  Their espresso drinks are so bitter, they make crazy mocha's seem sweet.  If they got their proverbial sh*t together it might be worth spending your money there."}
{"text":"Great breakfast in the burgh in the Strip.  Different things on the menu i.e. Shrimp and grits, beer pancakes with a sunny side egg between the two, with warm maple syrup and cinnamon butter.  Yum ."}
{"text":"After wandering around the Stip for over an hour in search of a breakfast option that wasn't repulsive looking (tons of  brown food smothered in gravy) or an hour wait -  we finally landed here.  We tried to order the veggie sausage... they were out of it. frown. we ordered the hummus plate & creamy polenta.     The Hummus plate was pretty & fresh, and all hand done (no bagged carrots or packaged hummus - thank you very much!)  It was satisfying!   But  enough about the hummus, it's everywhere, let's stop a minute here and give thanks to the chef that made that creamy polenta.   Oh my Garsh!  I am still thinking about it.  It was so creamy and the dried cherries on top... well, they really were the cherry on top. ha!    PS Where have all the good bagel shops gone?  Gluten Free?  Sigh!"}
{"text":"Great eggs benedict brunch!  Perfectly poached eggs and the hollandaise sauce was mild.  The windows/doors were open as it was a beautiful day outside so the atmosphere was open and airy.  Friendly staff, good food - no complaints!  If you're in the area and looking for a bite to eat, I would recommend Marty's.  I didn't explore the grocery sections, so my comments are only for the breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch places now a days. Coffee is fantastic, second best cappuccinos in the city. I topically get a breakfast sandwich but their salads are also wonderful!"}
{"text":"I really struggle giving Marty's  2 stars, because I want them to succeed...I'm just not sure they can.  It's located in the strip where Right By Nature used to be, and although the people that work there say it's NOT the same thing, it is a VERY SIMILAR THING...and we all know what happened to Right By Nature.  The people at Marty's are much more local and sustainably-minded, and do things like food tastings in-store, which is awesome.    I like Marty's a lot--they have organic and vegan food, lots of specialty local groceries, all local produce, a café, and a coffee bar.  The problem, as mentioned by Yelpers before me, is that EVERYTHING is prohibitively expensive.  $3 for iced coffee, $2 for KIND bars I buy at WF for $1.50, and almost double the prices I regularly pay on a couple grocery staples like quinoa and jarred pasta sauce. (Their bulk section is reasonable, though, to be totally fair!)  Also, they are new and working out the kinks.  The first time I went, even though they had a very rad taco tasting going on, all the coolers were totally empty from a power outage--so I couldn't buy the Jeni's ice cream I was excited about bringing home.  The second time, the coolers were full but they didn't have the one thing I was after (cottage cheese, if you were wondering).  I will give them one more shot in a few weeks, but three strikes--you're out."}
{"text":"Everyone has to be joking when I see that this has an average of 4 stars on yelp, this place is a joke. I have been here many times for brunch and shopping purposes, so this review is well founded. I used to live at the Cork Factory, hence coming here many times despite the terrible service and mediocre-at-best food - why you ask? Well, it was across the street, convenience, and they are BYOB. The fact that they are BYOB brunch is the only reason they got the second star in this review.   The \"restaurant\" - constant turnover in the staff makes this place completely unpredictable. Two month ago I ordered eggs benedict and the eggs came out with a completely hard center, bascially hard boiled - get this! - I send the eggs back for them to try again and guess what they send out?? again, hard boiled egg-like center, no runny yolk whatsoever - I send it back again (after the waitress watches me cut into a hard yolk in confusion) and they send out a third attempt to poach an egg, same hard yolk. She offered to take it back for a fourth try but I said no - need I remind you what the definition of insanity is, I was exhausted at this point. The dish was not taken off the bill, as an aside. I have had several of these type instances here. The most recent visit was brunch a week or so ago, knowing they cannot poach an egg I order them scrambled with cheddar, hash browns and bacon. I received scrambled, no cheddar, out of hash brown and sausage. I wanted the bacon so I asked for it and the waitress said they must have been confused (or she forgot because she doesn't write down the order - she is too good for that) stating \"it is almost 3, they probably won't cook it for you because the kitchen closes at 3\" - she came back 15 minutes later with the bill and said I had to pay so she could leave, never mentioned the bacon though she did say \"thanks for be flexible\" - meaning I didn't get what I ordered and had no choice because she wouldn't correct the order.  Bottom line - if you are \"flexible\" - give this place a shot!  The \"market\" - this is a hilarious excuse for a market. Having lived in the Cork Factory I can honestly say that I have bought at least a dozen different produce items and cut into them as soon as I arrived home only to find rot. My girlfriend once wondered if bell peppers were always supposed to be brown and black on the inside - that's how they always are from Marty's! What's worse than the produce you ask?? The meats and cheese! We used to get brie there because you know it is going to be ripe (brie gets soft/ripe after it sits for a while, time depends on variety, just a lesson in case you were confused). The meats and cheese have all been siting in that store for a very long time. The meats look terrible, just look in the case - dry, old and unappetizing. I wont buy cheese there anymore when I saw the packaged sliced cheese was green and fuzzy with mold, they have given up on caring the remove the really expired foods. Bread is so hard you could throw it through a window.   Bottom line - everything is expired here, if you are in a pinch and must buy something here - check the expiration dates!!! and never buy anything \"fresh\" - live by those rules or prepare for some down-time, if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Marty's Market is a cool spot in the Strip District neighborhood of Pittsburgh.  While The Strip is a hustling and bustling place on a Sunday morning/afternoon, Marty's Market, located on Smallman, is nicely set out of the bustle with easy-to-find parking.   I came for brunch and I was pleased with the menu selection.  I went for the breakfast \"sammich\" which I was able to substitute the sausage for bacon.  It was pretty delicious and affordable.  They have a full coffee bar but the wait is a little long for even a hot tea.  The wait was a little long for everything, but, it was a beautiful day, the garage door walls were open, and the sun was shining. Not hungry while you're there?  Then just go grocery shopping.  Because this eatery is located smack in the middle of a market.  Also, MAJOR bonus, the kitchen is open concept so you can watch the chefs cooking.  Why is this a bonus you ask?  There's a chef on staff who could be a dead ringer for Ryan Gosling.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"I always try to give places a second chance, and I am pleased to say that it paid off. I returned to Marty's Market for brunch today. My friend and I were promptly seated. I barely had time to recall the last visit issues when a server came to check on what I would like to eat. She was awesome. I didn't wait for anything. Food was delicious and served promptly. Coffee came with free refills, and the tab was extremely reasonable. GO MARTY'S!!! You made my morning. Now I have a new favorite brunch location. I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"After a hard night of dancing with a good friend, we were looking for a great place to eat that would resurrect ourselves. Marty's Market is a great combination of great breakfast food and good coffee. Both of us got an iced Americano that was pretty standard but above the average cup of coffee.  The coffee was good but the food was just even better. My friend ordered the cubano which is something I would usually go for but I could only be satiated by runny eggs and crusty bread so I refrained. He really enjoyed the sandwich and noted that the French fries were really good as well. I chose to go with the steak and eggs and there was nothing I would change about my decision. The steak was a smoked tri-tip. I had never had smoked steak and I am sad it has taken this long. The meal also came with eggs, bread, potatoes that were amazingly crispy and an ample amount of chimichurri smothering the steak. I would eat this meal every day.   I will note that the server was not entirely attentive and we did have to ask for cream a few times receiving it. However, I mean merely noting as the food was too good not to give the full 5 stars."}
{"text":"Based on other reviews, my expectations were high (maybe too high). It was my disappointment to find an overall forgetful brunch and underwhelming experience.  When you walk into this market/coffee bar/cafe... You're instantly made to think \"wow, there's a lot going on here,\" which seems to have overwhelmed the staff of the establishment as well.  To start, we were given a 15-25 minute wait time even though there were clearly 3 open tables available. Once we were finally seated  (at the bar area) we found the coffee delightful and the service good.  The menu, though seemingly limited, looks playful and interesting, full of fresh and organic options. When served, the pancakes - soggy (but still delicious), the omelette - boring (with basically no filling), side salads - awful (filled with wilty and old leaves that I was picking out of my meal to eat around the bad parts), and the Portuguese egg bake - acidic and pitiful (primarily canned tomatoes and a few onions that tasted like minestrone soup with an egg on top).  When I'm prompted with an organic, modern brunch option I expect a higher quality in taste and presentation to validate the higher sticker price. What I was met with was long (unnecessary) wait times, a forgettable brunch, and no TP in the girls bathroom."}
{"text":"Marty's Market is a beautiful store, but honestly I'm scared for them. Their renovation looks amazing, the staff I encountered were friendly, and they stock some interesting items. That said, if I lived in the immediate area I couldn't see myself doing my regular grocery shopping there. To me it definitely seemed like more of a gourmet/specialty shop. When we visited on a Saturday there were maybe a dozen other shoppers in the store at a time when the Strip is very busy.  They said they would be markedly different from Right By Nature, but it seems that they put themselves in an even smaller niche market and will have an even more difficult time staying profitable. And perhaps they do carry a large variety of local produce and other items, but I still saw the standard \"big box\" organic and natural foods items that I would find at Whole Foods, TJs, etc. except, of course, at higher prices. RBN at least had the benefit of carrying some regular grocery brands and convenience items like paper plates and whatnot, which opened up the store to the more \"typical\" shopper, but Marty's is all specialty.  While I loved the store and enjoyed my trip, I sadly don't see how it can survive where Right By Nature didn't. They are suffering from the same lack of advertising and lack of a base clientele in the immediate area as their predecessor. But I truly hope they grow and succeed."}
{"text":"I went in there on a Sunday around 3pm so there weren't that many people around. I think the cafe may have been closed, but I only went in for the market. I'd have to come back to try everything else. This review is only for the market portion.  I first looked over at the veggies and they looked fresh and vibrant. Though it's a somewhat smaller market, I noticed they had a bunch of items I look for at other places and can't find. I got Bubbie's sauerkraut, grilled chicken that were packed 2 breasts per package for $7, sunbutter, apple butter (without added sugar), 6 good size sausages for $12, 65% dark chocolate and a few other things. You have local, organic items that are priced a bit higher, but I feel they're worth spending the money for. Plus, there are so many amazing types of food in there to discover that it's half the fun to go in and browse. The market was clean and well-stocked. There was a nice man at the meat counter who recommended me a few items, which is always a plus. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Marty's is the type of market that those of us living near the Strip need. It's the perfect place to stop on your way home from work to gather any last-minute dinner items (except tamarind paste...or green onions that last time I went) after all of the other markets in the Strip are closed. I can't speak to the café portion of Marty's, but the grocery side is really nice.  Personally, I love supporting a local market, even if it means paying a little extra for certain items. Overall, the costs on-par with a Market District or Whole Foods, so if you're looking for healthier, organic options, why not keep this little guy going strong?  The store is beautiful and very open. It's rarely busy after work, and the employees are genuinely nice and helpful. They also do a good job of selling local products, so let's all do our part and continue to support the local communities and keep Marty's open and busy!  The only downside for me is the hours. If I work late, I might not get there before the doors are locked."}
{"text":"I am on the email list for Marty's Market events and the latest emails have highlighted their HH specials. Enticing enough that a friend and I stopped in on a Wednesday evening around 5:30. The Happy hour special includes $3 beer, $5 wine and half off the bar menu. I am drawn to places that include food in their HH specials. Their drink menu isn't elaborate but they have something for everyone. I opted for Jack's pear cider because it's the only gluten free \"beer\" option and it is locally sourced. My friend opted for Little Brown Ale and Chocolate Stout. FYI-Their drinks only come in bottles so you are unable to taste any before you order. I hope to see Marty's expand their cider selection in the future. Hint: Arsenal Cider house is local and delicious!   Off of the bar menu, there were vegetarian/vegan and gluten free items noted but none that were both gluten free and vegan. I switched over to the dinner menu and ordered a side of roasted winter vegetables (beets & squash) My friend opted for the cheese and meat plate from the bar menu. The food was served relatively quickly. My roasted vegetables were diced and delicately seasoned. I could still taste the natural flavor of the beets and squash. My friend's plate came slivers of the meat and cheese listed on the menu, a large serving of mustard seeds and grilled bread. She had no complaints about the flavor but we both agreed that the portions were too small. She didn't have enough on her plate to pair with the mustard seeds, even with the grilled bread. I finished my side of vegetables in a few bites. I don't know if portions are down sized during HH to compensate cutting the cost or if they are always that size. Either way, we didn't feel that the quality of the food made up for the portion size.  Our waitress was very pleasant and attentive and the bar/seating area has a cozy feel. I love the look of the exposed kitchen and the option to shop in the store once you're done eating. Outside of my dining experience, I have been to Marty's for groceries and always found what I needed at a decent price. They have unique health food items so it's easy for me to find gluten free & vegan friendly options. Moving forward, I will continue to shop at Marty's for groceries and perhaps I'll try their dinner one evening. The full menu looked awesome. For HH, however, I will venture to places where I get more bang for my buck."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Marty's Market for brunch and I finally went yesterday with a friend. Honestly we were both disappointed. We sat outside which was great and probably the best part about our brunch. The service was so slow and the food was just okay. After sitting there for about 15 minutes we finally were able to order (drinks and food at the same time). When our food came out we still didn't have our coffee and had to ask for it. When my latte did come I could tell it had been sitting on the counter for awhile. I had the spring veggie omelet with salad and a pancake. The pancake was good but the omelet was not even hot and nothing special. Overall I was very disappointed with our experience."}
{"text":"Great food once I got it. The service is horrendously executed. The waiter forgot my coffee after two reminders and it took an hour to get our food, inexcusable."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Marty's three times in the last year and each time has been an increasingly terrible experience. I really appreciate what they are trying to do (or what it seems to me they are trying to do): offer a modern, edgy twist on the more traditional breakfast spots/diners in The Strip. But to DO that and to do that WELL, service has GOT to be better. It has always seemed to me that the staff are poorly trained and exhibit the worst possible \"I'm-a-cool-hipster-and-thus-will-get-to-you-when-I-get-to-you\" vibe that I've ever seen. The place has obvious potential and I want to like it but they've got a loooong way to go to beat the friendly efficiency of DeLucas, Pamela's, or Kelly O's. And the food? Meh. While it's compellingly different, culinarily it leaves me cold. Be better, guys!  Update: just read in the paper that this place has closed. I hate to see new and interesting businesses flounder, but this one never got it together for me. I wish the ownership had paid more attention to the negative reviews, all of which called attention to the same lack of service ethic. Oh well, here's hoping a really great new place snags the spot!"}
{"text":"Such a beautiful market! The layout is modern and clean, and the produce selection was excellent in my opinion. It may vary day to day, since they use local farmers. We get our CSA from Clarion River Organics so I was happy to see their products in the produce section. I love the setup of this place. They don't have a lot, but literally everything I need and the prices are not super cheap, but it's a local business, so I'm willing to support. The bulk foods section is great for grains or nuts. I also think their freezer section has a good selection of products. Haven't tried their cafe yet, but cannot wait to come back. My only gripe is their hours. If they opened a bit earlier and closed a bit later, I think the 9-5'ers would be more drawn to stop in before or after work. I work until 6pm so sometimes barely make it in, and it would be lovely to pick up some snacks on my way to work. All in all, super thrilled to have a new local market fill the space of what used to be!"}
{"text":"This supermarket has a great little cafe and coffee bar.  I had the breakfast sandwich which was delicious and included house made sausage and fresh sourdough bread.  And the cold press coffee was fantastic.  It happened to be a nice day so I sat outside but they also have plenty of inside seating.  My only complaint is that it's a little pricey (their supermarket items as well) and the portions are small, but it is very tasty and of high quality.  Service was fast and friendly--you order at the counter then they bring it out to you and come by for drink refills, etc."}
{"text":"The cafe item I had here was very good.    The grocery section is not cheap but it's not crazy either.  The prices are in line with a small specialty grocer.  They have bioclean for example cheaper then anywhere else I have seen it for sale.  They also have a lot of items I can't find anywhere else.  I like that.  They have a butterscotch soda that reminds me of the butter beer at the harry potter exibit at universal Oralando."}
{"text":"Cool market at 23rd and Smallman past the Strip.  They validate parking in the lot if you spend $35.  You don't have to go to the kiosk in the parking garage, just proceed to the exit gate with your ticket.  The market was in a transition, I think, on my visit.  Racks of stuff coming in and out.  It was a little sparse and a little expensive but they're on the right track.  Local, organic, healthy.  They need to source some raw milk.  If you're avoiding dairy, you should try raw milks and cheeses.  They are easier to digest and healthier for you especially goat as opposed to cow.  The cafe wasn't open so I couldn't sample anything to eat or enjoy coffee.  Too bad, I was hungry for dinner and could have gone for a bite.  They had some terrific looking proteins and the cheese department is one of the best I have seen in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Behind the counter, she wiped her foot with a foot cloth, then served food to people. We didn't get that food but damn if we weren't sitting there waiting on our eggs Benedict and instead we were served the Benediction of bacterial infection.   However off putting that was -- and I'm typically not one to mention a singular isolated incident in a review but it was just so odd -- The food was excellence in its decadence. The breakfast sandwich was served on French Toast.   I dig the counter set up for brunch inside the market. It looks like a perfect local business to be an alternative to Whole Foods.   Where the Strip is a bit wooly, this place is slick. For such a dense area, this is one of a better sit down brunch options. Despite the footwiping foot handler, I'll be back when in town."}
{"text":"It was Mother's Day and my boys took me to the Strip to walk around and have lunch. The place we wanted to eat at was closed. We were standing there talking about where we should go when a friend of my oldest son walked up and started giving us suggestions. When she said Marty's Market I got really excited. I had totally forgotten that it was at the Strip. So off we went.  We signed in and shopped the market while waiting to be seated. We found all kinds of goodies-fresh grass fed beef and pork, local beers, a great selection of rices to try and a lot of new options to choose to eat. Twice people came by with trial sizes of fresh juices. We were seated and given a brunch menu. Their were lots of delicious sounding options. My youngest son ordered 2 eggs, bacon, home fries, and toast. He ate every bite. He can be a picky eater so I was surprised. It was all fresh and looked yummy.  My oldest son couldn't choose between the pancakes or the French toast so I told him the we would each order one and we would share. When our food came to the table I wanted ALL of it!!!  I was drooling just smelling it.  The pancakes were filled with berries and cooked to perfection. They came with a blueberry syrup that was the bursting with blueberry flavor. It wasn't thick and gooey but instead it flowed lightly over the pancakes. There were so many berries in the pancakes that I don't even know if you needed the syrup. The French toast wasn't made out if white bread or Texas toast but instead it was made of a brioche bread that was light and fluffy. On top of the toast was peach jam and maple foam. Oh My Gosh it was a taste of heaven!  The combination of the peach jam and maple foam was delightful. I can never have regular French toast again.  I can't wait to go back and try other dishes. Don't forget to hold your place in line with the No Wait app. Marty's Market is a busy place. They also have a great coffee bar. It will be my first stop at the Strip. Nothing like a great cup of coffee to sip on while you shop."}
{"text":"I was excited to take my mom here for a mother's day brunch... but maybe I should have taken it for a test drive first.  Overall, I like what they're trying to do here in concept... but they need to do some SERIOUS work on their wait/host staff and kinks in their service. Here's how my experience went and my overall observations.  You'll notice in my notes below, that food and atmosphere were very good. With these two things in their favor, they really need to get the other things in line, in order to have a successful food service business.  I've been to 5-star restaurants in major cities and other countries... and used to have a highly established F&W publication as a client... so I'm no novice.  Besides the food, atmosphere, and the company at my table... it was not a good experience.  If you want to go there to sit on your computer and drink one cup of coffee (because they won't ask you if you want more), then have at it. NOT a place for a special occasion brunch.  Service and customer treatment was VERY poor. See below...  1. HOSTESS -- We were there 15 mins earlier than our reservation. I checked in and said I knew we were early but asked if they may be able to seat us early. The place was 80% open or I would not have asked.   I was told they would be ready for us at the time we made the reservation. We patiently waited... I checked in with the hostess to ask if we could sit at a table outside when they sat us (we noticed a plethora of open tables)... the hostess said she'd \"have to think about it\" (her words) and I stood by while she sat other guests.   Eventually she acknowledged me, saying they'd get one of those tables outside ready. Our party stepped outside (sidewalk where outdoor dining area was in-view) since it was beautiful out, to wait. It was 10 minutes past our reservation and there was no table being prepped for us.   Finally, we saw someone setting napkins and glasses out for 4 -- since we witnessed nobody else seated outside in the meantime -- and instead of dealing with the incompetent hostess again... we sat down.  2. FOOD -- It was actually quite good. Although nothing to write home about, if I'm being honest. Everything was overall tasty, fresh and hot though.   3. TABLE SERVICE / OTHER STAFF -- Once we sat down, we were asked by two people if we \"had a reservation,\" if they had \"seated us\" and if we \"checked in with the hostess.\" I politely said yes to all, figuring they could work it out on their own. I didn't think I needed to recap my earlier experience. We had to wait another 5 minutes at least for water and menus. Again, the place was sparse with guests.   When the waitress came by, there were no pleasantries exchanged, or \"have you been here before\" -- There was a prix fixe menu with various courses. I asked if we were supposed to order all courses (drinks, app, entree, dessert) at once or how they preferred it, and the waitress looked at me like I had 4 heads and said \"all of it now would be great\" (her words), okay then...  Coffee and tea arrived - no cream or milk - we had to ask for it. They only brought enough sweetener for the one person that asked (although we all needed it). Never once during the meal asked if we'd like a refill on coffee or tea.... or any other drinks for that matter.  Wait staff was not friendly nor attentive. I could give more examples throughout the meal, but you get the picture.  4. ATMOSPHERE -- great. Loved it."}
{"text":"I concur with all of the wonderful things that have been noted in the reviews.  This is a marvelous store with all of the upscale items one could want.  It is attractive and inviting, and the workers with whom I have interacted have gone the extra mile to be courteous and welcoming.  It is a plus that the store also offers a clean, decent-sized rest room unlike the antiquated rest room/broom closet that is provided by Robert Wholey Company down the street. The sticking point is the cost of virtually everything at Marty's, e. g., $7.99 per pound for fresh asparagus at a time that it is offered for $1.99 to $2.99 per pound elsewhere.  I did not know there are so many wealthy people in Pittsburgh who are willing to pay outlandish prices, in most instances multiples of what one would pay at a good grocery store.  The only item which is affordable and can be considered to be offered at a \"sale\" price is the day-old and two day-old bread, which is perfectly fine in quality and taste (25% off and 50% off, respectively).  The store does not even offer complimentary garage parking with a purchase as did its predecessor, Right by Nature.  I have a new appreciation for Giant Eagle, Aldi, Bottom Dollar Food (soon to be of blessed memory), and Shop 'n Save."}
{"text":"Favorite spot in the strip for speciality, health food items The shelves are flooded with speciality items for your pantry, there's always a huge assortment of organic produce, and the butcher shop is on another level! Only the freshest, organic, free range meats can be found at Marty's. Nicky is the main butcher and he's so passionate about his meats, ask him any questions about prep or meal planning and he'll offer up a lot of wisdom and advice. Lovely little grocer I can't recommend enough to my family and friends."}
{"text":"A few friends and I have made our way back to Marty's a few times since the soft opening, and our primary takeaway is this:  soooooo expensive.  I get that they're independent, that they provide a lot of organic, vegan, specialty foods, but it is just prohibitively expensive, from the produce to the convenience foods to the iced coffee (over $3 for regular iced coffee?).   The staff seem nice enough (if a bit slow) and I still love the atmosphere...but the prices?  It's a little much."}
{"text":"Simply put, the ambiance is bright and inviting. The cafe adjoins the actual market. The food is prepared with care and the service is prompt. I had the special most recently which was a Caesar salad. Delicious! Finished the plate and wanted more (but didn't need more).  Great place!"}
{"text":"Marty's is a beautiful little upscale grocery and cafe on the Strip. For the type of business that they are, I can't speak highly enough about the ambiance: bright, natural light, cool murals, open kitchen and a nice, airy feel throughout. Marty's is two businesses, so I'll split my review accordingly:  The market gets a solid 3 1/2 stars from me; it is a great space with some creative details (like the repurposed library catalog for the spices) and there's some reasonable value given the location. I really like the two dollar small spice packets, which is a little pricier than bulk, but better quality than most bulk bins and much cheaper than the typical spice jars that you find in a grocery store. Their butcher is very good. Overall selection is on the small side. Prices are mostly competitive with Whole Foods. Service here is friendly.  As for the cafe, sadly 2 stars. The food is pretty good, although not spectacular. Just solid food made with decent basic ingredients. The coffee is better, and espresso drinks from the bar are some of the better cups that I've had around town. Service is deficient. I can't tell if they're understaffed or what, but table busing was very slow (we were quoted a 1/2+ hour wait when there were three open tables in plain sight) and wait service was not much faster. The hostess was unpleasant. Our table had garbage stuffed in one of the sugar holders (and there was no sugar, just stevia left). My order was mixed up. On the other hand, our waitress was friendly. But that alone couldn't cover up for the long interval waits (for fresh cream and sugar after receiving our coffee, for our food, for our check). Overall a pretty disappointing experience. To leave this review on a good note, however, the bathrooms were very clean (as was most of the store and restaurant space)."}
{"text":"After seeing numerous pictures on Instagram, I really wanted to check the place out. I took my little here for Sunday brunch and I was very impressed. While we waited for our table, we walked around the market. The produce section of the market was very clean and organized. Although I would never buy the vegetables there because it was not within my price range, they all look fresh.   Now for the important part: the brunch food. The menu was not extensive but had plenty of choices that piqued my interest. After much debate, I decided to get the daily special which was a chorizo omelet with a side salad. My little decided to get the smoked chicken sandwich with fries as a side. The chorizo and cheese content in the omelet was the right amount with the chorizo adding the right spiciness to the mixture. The vinaigrette for the side salad was very light and was a great side to cut through the omelet. My little enjoyed his smoked chicken sandwich, especially the bacon. We also got macchiatos which we didn't expect would come in a shot form. The espresso shot was surprisingly very strong but I enjoyed it. I highly recommend this place as a brunch or lunch place and then exploring the Strip District afterwards!"}
{"text":"Four stars for the food and coffee.  When this place first opened, the cafe food was mouth-wateringly good -- every single item I ordered off the menu (some of my favorites are the meatballs small dish, the chopped salad, and the caprese salad with heirloom tomatoes & burrata cheese) was delicious.  Since then, my lunches there have been a little more inconsistent -- but the food is mostly good.  The coffee and lattes here are excellent; the baristas really know what they are doing.  The atmosphere is also very nice...a huge improvement upon the previous Right By Nature.  Very open and modern.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The market itself, however, leaves much to be desired.  They have a very specific subset of specialty grocery items, most of which are available at places like Whole Foods for cheaper.  Their produce is often wilty, certainly not because they don't get it fresh, but most likely due to the lack of rapid rotation from enough people buying it from the market.  The limited meat I have tried there has been good, except for the bacon, which I thought did not hold a candle to the Whole Foods' meat counter's Wellshire dry rub bacon.  I will continue to visit Marty's every once in awhile for lunch and/or coffee and perhaps to pick up some featured produce if it's fresh, but my initial enthusiasm for the concept and the quality has waned a bit.  I would like to try some more things from the meat counter, as it seems like the butcher is excellent and knowledgeable, and they carry parts that many other groceries do not (e.g. bone marrow)."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I went for lunch and had the lamb sliders with goat cheese and they were amazing! The atmosphere of the place is adorable too! They definitely stand strong with their local and organic approach without making the process unreasonable! The only negative was service was really slow and our waitress didn't apologize after forgetting about us for a while."}
{"text":"Not surprised to see that this place has almost 5 stars. They are making a difference in Pittsburgh with their market and cafe. I also understand they will be serving alcohol soon!!!!!! For now it's BYOB  Everything was fresh, made to order and high quality. I had fresh cut fruit - strawberries, blueberries, raspberries. My friend had a chicken sandwich, and broccoli soup. Compliments to the chefs.    We waited about 20 minutes for a table on a Saturday morning for brunch, browsed the store and grabbed a locally brewed green tea from the cooler. Great experience, thanks!"}
{"text":"I was a tad disappointed that Marty's Market doesn't offer a spot of food past 3PM, but I was impressed with the selection of meats, cheeses, snacks, vegetables, and other gourmet, organic goods that can be bought here, even if everything is a little pricey for the average workin' man such as myself. This warehouse of a store is clean and spacious, and there's oodles of things to gawk at. Akin to the McGinnis grocery that used to be in Castle Shannon but with much more room, the meat and fish case alone was stunning, those crimson steaks beckoning to be grilled, that iced squid begging to be cut up into rings, breaded, and deep fried. For those who live in The Strip District, Marty's has to be a godsend. I'd probably be here everyday had I a loft on Railroad Street.    I'll have to return for breakfast or lunch in the near future."}
{"text":"This is for the cafe only. For what it is: some of the best breakfast food I've had in a while. The eggs benedict (salmon) was close to perfect, with a delicious homemade sauce and perfectly cooked fresh eggs. The potatoes were truly fantastic. Also, high quality coffee. And my partner also enjoyed her latte greatly. Highly recommended, though based on a limited sampling so far. (PS The store did look nice with a good selection of high end food, though it appeared pricey)."}
{"text":"The Strip District is one of my favorite neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. Lots of restaurants and markets, bursting with local flavor. Authentic Pittsburgh goodness. I had brunch at Marty's Market with Christine on a sunny Saturday morning. It was the perfect place for a long overdue catch up session. Everything about Marty's market, from the seasonal menu to the modern market space is right up my alley.   I have a special love for brunch and a weakness for poached eggs. They also have a number of vegetarian options. Obviously, I couldn't turn down the Eggs Florentine ($8). Poached organic eggs, spinach, and hollandaise sauce on an English muffin. I've never seen such pale hollandaise, but it was still flavorful and creamy. I satisfied my craving for freshly squeezed orange juice.   I also ordered a side of their house vegan sausage ($3.50). The \"sausage\" patties were nicely browned and very meaty. I don't know what all the ingredients are, but the fennel definitely makes a big difference. I took one patty to go so John could try it too."}
{"text":"Great location in the strip, great ambience. Slow service, by rushed staff. Long wait for food. Soggy flavorless chopped salad, burnt home fries, over cooked eggs, and bacon that seemed to have been cooked in burnet oil . Long wait for check, and server put another tables dirty plates on our table while clearing ours. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I almost wanted to give this 4 stars because for groceries the place is a bit expensive but my brunch this past Sunday was 5 star worthy. OMG. The croissant French toast is amazing. Truly. It was so decadent and yet fresh and light! I loved it and am still thinking about it days later. I've been here before with my husband and everything we've tried so far has been delicious.   The grocery selection is great for those avoiding gluten, looking for fresh and organic foods. We love the glass jars of milk but couldn't keep up with returning them and getting more. We go through too much milk daily. (I wish they delivered.) We also loved that they carried Jeni's Ice Cream and hope that will be back soon!   Overall, I will return many times for brunch but it's not going to become my main grocery store."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and both times we have enjoyed the food and then done a little shopping in the market afterwards.  The pancakes are really nice and the biscuits and gravy are wonderful.    They will validate your parking so take advantage of the covered parking."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch, they seated us quickly.  The food came out pretty quick also . So it would be a good place to go during work lunch break.   I had the turkey sandwhich it was really good with a side of field greens I loved the dressing on the salad!   Theres also a nice coffee bar, they have cold drinks and specialty coffee drinks,  and the coffee bar opens up to the outside so can can grab a coffee if your just walking by!"}
{"text":"I love the food at martys market, I've never had a bad meal.. Props to the chef! Nothing is brought in, everything is made fresh daily and it's obvious!   There's many gluten free and vegan options available for your dietary needs.  I wish I could give it a better rating but the waiters and waitresses are unbelievably slow! Shame on them! It took me an hour for eggs and toast on a slow early morning, reason was the waiter took 12 minutes to get my order and another 15 minutes to put it in.  I love the grab and go section made daily, penn ave fish co supplies the sushi, this is the only place I'll come get grab and go pre packaged sushi!  Great little market to shop inside, at times it's pricey but it is worth it.   This place is currently under construction as they acquired a liquor license and they will also start serving dinner soon which I can't wait to experience."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed to have to write this review.  I really want to like Marty's Market, but the experiences just haven't warranted anything but a disappointing review.  My son and I tried it once a few weeks ago and it was fantastic, but was during the week.  Wonderful breakfast tacos, great coffee and a beautiful waffle with a ton of fresh fruit.  Here is where it goes downhill.    I brought my daughter back there because my son and I wanted to show it off, this was now on a Saturday.  Terrible service, took 45 minutes to get food, cold coffee, burnt potatoes, and absolutely zero recognition of their poor service.  The owner at Marty's is great, but she was so overwhelmed that day, she didn't notice our service and food was bad.  So, because we had such a great first experience, I decided to bring my wife back there to try it for the third time, to break the tie essentially.    I didn't think it could get worse, but it did.  They were out of tortillas for the breakfast tacos, mind you, they told me 20 minutes after we ordered our food.  No refills on the coffee until I asked for it 30 minutes later.  Apparently they had changed their menu and no longer offered the fruit on the waffle, so for $7 or $8 you got a plain waffle.  It took another 10 minutes to get anyone to give us syrup.  From there, my wife's order did not have something specific that she had asked for.  The potatoes were once again burnt and again the service was so so slow.  To top off the experience, after eating half the waffle, my son said it was a bit sour.  I asked, \"sour\"????  Well, I tasted it myself and guess what, it was very sour.  So, they either decided to make a sourdough type waffle or they used rotten milk/dairy product.  Either way, it was easily the worst waffle I have ever had, that includes the fair!    So, to the owner of Marty's and all that work there, you have a great atmosphere and an opportunity to be one of the best places to eat, but training is required, need some help in the kitchen and make sure there is someone walking around to make sure things are going well.  BTW, I have never left a review on Yelp, it was bad enough for me to get an account and post this review in the hopes something will change and they become the restaurant they can be."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times for both shopping and dining in the cafe. Here is what I like:  Delicious food that is healthy and tasty  Nice selection of healthy foods   Here is what I don't like: The service - the people at the cafe in particular. They would rather inconvenience you, the customer, than to go out of their way to provide any type of service, Which leads me to the second thing that I dislike, which is their prices. I realize that the price point is a little higher for some of your items, and I would be fine with that if I felt I was appreciated as a customer, but since that's my first dislike, then this makes the prices much less palatable.   I mean seriously."}
{"text":"This review is for both the market and the associated cafe. The market sources high quality items and I generally highly recommend it for picking up sauces, breads, cheeses etc. It does not have a robust inventory but you will likely be pleased with what they have. I've had breakfast and lunch at the cafe. The food is exceptional and worth checking out. Unfortunately, the service has been significantly lacking on both occasions and really drags down the overall experience. This would easily be a five star rating if not for the service. I'm not sure this is due to any particular reason as everyone is always polite, but there seems to be a complete lack of management going on. On both occasions I was there, it has not been busy. They require you to wait to be seated, but no one greets you or even acknowledges you are there. It's been well over 5 minutes with employees walking back and forth both times before even noticing anyone is there. It's also pretty apparent when you are seated that this is a problem because you can see other patrons being ignored as well. The food has also taken over 30 minutes after ordering each time which I think is a bit unacceptable for the type of fare they serve. I will reiterate that the food is great, but if it weren't for the associated market, I probably wouldn't come back due to these issues seemingly being prevalent every time I go."}
{"text":"I drove by this place several times and was always attracted by its modern decor. I thought it was only a grocery store, but I just learned that they serve brunch so decided to give it a try. The dining area is not big but the food was awesome. We had the pork head torchon, breakfast sammich, and one pancake. All worth recommending!  The coffee was a little disappointing but probably because I ordered a decaf. The grocery store is a bit smaller than I expected."}
{"text":"A couple months ago, this would have easily been 5 stars, oh how Father Time changes all.   I've been a strong proponent of the Market since I started visiting over a year ago...the food was great, filling, and I was always enticed to make other purchases at the market upon leaving. The perceived success of the establishment is warming, as I want nothing more than successful small businesses thriving in this city and becoming hotspots for those within and outside of the aforementioned limits.   With that said, my opinion of the Market has drastically changed within the past few visits. An eatery can have a bad day, a bad plate, thus it was important to not dismiss my favorite brunch place immediately...sadly the same occurrences have happened, and at this time, are beginning to appear as a trend.  We are always greeted right away, but upon seating, it has taken between 12-15 minutes for us to be acknowledged, let alone a drink provided. The inconsistency and the rate at which the waitstaff addresses tables varies in a pattern that I cannot quite predict. Some wait as we do, others address with minutes of sitting down. I appreciate the casual approach, but there is a fine line between nonchalant and negligence.  Today's experience was most troubling, as we were not provided a carafe of water and was not provided a refill throughout the entire meal, along with an empty coffee mug.  While the quality of ingredients I'm sure are the same, this has not transpired to the plate. Fried eggs are received over-easy, scrambled eggs that are rubbery, and bacon and grilled bread that are cold.   I truly hope this place can turn it around."}
{"text":"Marty's Market. There are two sides of it to mention:  The cafe/restaurant - you'll slurp your coffee/eat your brunch near large windows, with lots of natural light, or if the weather permits, on a small outside patio. I enjoyed that myself quite a few times. I'd go back for the location - located in the middle of the Strip District, the coffee bar offers a nice hangout/chill spot after you've done lots of walking and shopping. 4 stars.  The store - Marty's Market focuses on high quality food and you do get items that anywhere else would be labeled as \"exquisite\". If you're willing to pay for it, this is your place. Well, I am not. I don't see the point of paying $3.99 for a cucumber. Where I come from a cucumber costs 49 cents at Aldi (okay maybe German grocery prices aren't really applicable) but you get the point. Expect to pay A LOT. Not sure if the regular clientele really cares but I do find it overly and unnecessarily expensive. 2 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing food but incredibly badly run restaurant   Waited 30 minutes for a table   Our spot was given to someone else ...checked with Hostess and told she had just seated us So we waited for another table and told we could not be seated because the open table was a 4 top and we were only 2 people.   Really ... It is incredible that we would have others seated before us then told we were not large enough for the open table so they could make more money  Go elsewhere if you wanted to be treated well"}
{"text":"Marty's Market is an eclectic market/restaurant hybrid in the Strip District, and is one of my favorite brunch spots in the city. I love the feel of this place: plenty of windows, bright colors, and kind of an industrial feel with the furniture and fixtures. It's very clean and open. I think the food in the grocery or market portion is a bit expensive, but they do stock some items that you can't get at a normal grocery store. It's fun to wander around the market while you wait for your table (and you will probably be waiting for awhile if you come for brunch, so call ahead)!  I've been here numerous times for Sunday brunch and Marty's Market never disappoints. First off, the freshly squeezed orange juice is a must-try. I don't even like orange juice and I absolutely love the orange juice at Marty's Market. I usually get the classic \"two eggs your way\" for brunch along with a pancake from the \"sides\" section of the menu. The griddled bread and potatoes that you get with the eggs are so delicious. I find that classic brunch selections at most restaurants with eggs, bacon, potatoes, etc. tend to be greasy and heavy, but this is not so at Marty's Market. Everything tastes so fresh. The side pancake is only $2 and is hands down the best pancake I have ever eaten and probably ever will eat. First of all it's huge, so it's a great deal. You could easily share it with another person. The pancake is like a delightful fluffy cloud in your mouth and is covered with some sort of cinnamon sugar concoction that I dream about for days after I eat it. It's really just incredible. I also appreciate the REAL maple syrup that they give you on the side - I grew up eating real maple syrup and hate how most restaurants only use that fake sugary sorry excuse for maple syrup. I always leave Marty's Market very full and very happy. Try it for brunch ASAP!"}
{"text":"I have been to this market multiple times now and tried out a variety of items.    Overall the store is beautiful and well laid out, but some of the prices are shocking.  Being on a low carb diet I was able to find many items that are acceptable for me to eat which was nice.    I am also a big fan of the meat and cheese counter and its selection.   I will definitely be back for specialty items, but I don't know that I would be here everyday!"}
{"text":"I have found my new perfect work spot! Weird, you say, because this is a market? But it's not just a market, but a cafe as well! They have a full coffee bar that reminds me of 21st Street Coffee down the street. They are, as well, serious about their coffee!  You can take a seat at many of the tables and enjoy a warm cup of chai, in my case, at least! Or grab lunch from their fresh and seasonal menu. I've had a delicious pear salad, with candied walnuts and goat cheese. It was on the small side, so I'd encourage you to grab a soup to go along with it.   You will probably notice the prices are not cheap. But that sort of thing comes with the territory of carrying local and fresh produce. I'm really into all the varieties of products I've never seen before. Better yet, they look so good I usually have to buy them (good job on their part!). I've found they have an awesome selection of Lara Bars and this certain grapefruit juice that isn't that sugary sweet crap you get from Minute Maid.  I've still got a lot of ground to cover with ordering fresh meats and cheeses from their specialty counter. But I don't doubt I'll get to that... After all, this IS my new \"office.\""}
{"text":"Marty's Market...where do I begin?  You have a lot of awesome products - some great products that I can't even find anymore at Whole Foods or the East End Food Co-op, yet you have roughly 97% of the same products as both stores, and your prices are of so much higher than Whole Foods (comparable to the Co-op even with the \"member\" discount) so I only shop with you on very rare occasions to buy a few items on my way home from work when I don't feel like backtracking to Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, I don't want to deal with the craziness of GE Market District Shadyside, and need something that I can't get at the GE close to home.  I can buy 3 items at MM and spend $20 where I could get the same items at WF for less than $15 so when a store is more expensive than \"whole paycheck\" even if it's locally owned, it's hard for me to support it on a regular basis particularly when parking is even more of a nightmare than the WF parking lot.  The cafe space is lovely but it's generally closed by the time I arrive so I've yet to enjoy it and you can't get me near the Strip on a weekend semi-agoraphobe that I am (note, I've been to New Orleans 25 times yet never for Mardi Gras because I can't handle crowds lol).  Anyhow, I really, REALLY want to love you, but I can't because of the outrageous prices, but I will still support you on occasion for impulse or small grocery needs."}
{"text":"I love how unique this place is. The market on the right side of the building has a variety of items that you can't find everywhere. I especially appreciate the fact that they now carry Millie's ice cream (shout out!). I love the atmosphere inside with the string lighting and open kitchen and big middle bar area. Marty's has always been at the top of my list for brunch options. Their brunch food is just so good! The only downfall is that it can be a bit of a wait time to be seated. But they use no-wait and have various samples of cheeses, dips, juice etc on Sunday mornings around their market side of the building that you can wander around and sample while you wait.   Now, the reason I gave this place four stars was due to their happy hour and dinner. When I heard they now started serving dinner I was very excited. However I was a little underwhelmed with the amount and taste of the dinner food. Because I'm always so impressed with their brunch, i was hoping to be equally as such with their dinner, but it just wasn't the case. We had the burger and the scallops and we rated it about a 6 out of 10.   We then went back to happy hour this week to give that a try. The drink deal is pretty good, which is $3 beer and $5 wine from 5-7. The best thing food wise we ordered was the cheese plate, which was only $7 and so much cheese. Great deal. But everything else was a little underwhelming, which was the mac and cheese, bbq squash, and jambalaya pierogies.   All in all, Marty's is a great, unique place to try in the strip and I can't wait to go back and enjoy brunch again soon'"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here last Saturday with a friend and thought the food was quite good although the service seemed a little slow in terms of getting our drinks and the food we ordered. Raj, our server was very nice and professional and made some great recommendations. I was excited to take my husband there for dinner so we returned on Wednesday to try their menu.   We decided to sit outside on the patio since it was such a nice evening. We ordered a bottle of wine and perused the menu to make our selections. We shared the watermelon and tomato salads which were very good.   However, my husband, who ordered the salmon, had to send it back as it was still raw in the middle and he ordered it medium, so it should have been cooked throughout. The server offered to have another piece of salmon cooked for him, but my hubby was happy to just have the same piece cooked a little longer.   I ordered the Goyza pierogies which were described as stuffed with shrimp, pork and napa cabbage with sesame, What I received was a mushy pink colored blob stuffed inside the pierogie, It did not taste like shrimp or pork, in fact it tasted like mushy salmon, which I do not like. I asked the server to take it away since I did not want it and it wasn't what I expected from the menu description. He offered to bring me a menu to select something else, which I did review, but decided not to order anything else.   When the bill came, they had still charged me for the pierogies, saying that I had eaten most of it, I asked to speak to a manager since I disagreed with that line of thought. I had cut into the dish, and pulled the stuffing out, but since it was inedible, had really only eaten a small bite of it.   The manager was defensive, rude and insulting and obviously lacks any skill in customer relations. I was not looking to get something for free, I just didn't want to pay for something I did not enjoy and felt did not match the menu description.  She did take the pierogies off after I complained about the charge.   Here's the bottom line: my husband sent back his salmon as it was not cooked right the first time. My food was not edible.  We will never return and will advise others to avoid this place. I have worked in the restaurant industry for over 25 years and have never felt so offended, We will gladly take our business elsewhere.  The manager, who I later learned was Regina, the owner, was offensive and argued with me over a $5.00 plate."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the quality of the supermarket. It was very clean nice and open. I bought some awesome hard to find crackers that were delicious, but the thing I want to talk about is the coffee bar.   First of all the barista was skilled.... I use to be one and I know my coffee and so did he. They brew and sell Coava coffee there which is pretty awesome stuff out of Portland, Oregon. To test the barista I ordered a Macchiato which shows their ability to handle the steaming of the milk and the draw of the espresso. It was very good with a nice fern leaf marked in the foam.   I would recommend the coffee there for sure."}
