{"text":"I got a voucher from groupon to spend $35 for 2 people. The food was good for a vegetarian place. I would recommend the food and the place, for people to try at least once."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my sister after buying a groupon ($15 for $35).
Food is mediocre, some even boring and bad-tasting.
Very expensive!! We got two small plates of food plus some dessert and two drinks and the bill came out to $47!!!!!! Probably the priciest canteen style meal I've ever had.
So even after using the groupon I had to pay an extra $12.
NOT happy about paying $27 in total for the quality and amount of food we got.
And felt bloated (in a bad way) afterwards.
Would not recommend and would not come again, trying once is enough for me. There are so many better options around.
The Longos salad bar nearby is much better, for around the same price."}
{"text":"Just walk on and try somewhere else.  I've been twice, thinking that the first time, we were just there on an off day--we weren't.  The food is bland, lukewarm and very expensive.  I think the restaurant is suffering from the same problem that many buffets do--quality is lost in quantity.   On my last visit, there were flies around the open desserts.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and have been for many, many, many years. I was there when the only vegetarian food in a restaurant was the salad. I was there when I went to Mcdonalds in Europe and ordered a veggie burger, I got a burger bun with salad (and nothing else), I was there when...well, I'm sure you catch my drift here. I am used to lousy veggie food. That said, in recent years, many restaurants have been making an effort, so on the whole, I feel pretty well catered for when dining out in non-specifically-vegetarian restaurants (my partner is a card carrying carnivore).

When I saw the groupon for Commensal, I jumped at the chance! Finally a restaurant with - by the looks of it - tons of choice for little ol' veggie me! I was *so* excited! 

The groupon seemed pretty generous too, $30 with drinks included! Go us!! 

Unfortunately, I was left very, very disappointed. We had never been to this place before and when we came in, I am sure we must have looked a little unsure about the process. Not only that, I also said - fairly loudly to my partner - \"Gosh, we've never been here before, so I'm a little unsure of the process\".  Apparently *looking* lost *and* sounding lost, was still not enough to jolt the girl at the cash register into action. So, after standing around for a good 5 minutes, hoping and *willing* her to ask if she could help, I went over and asked what we were supposed to do. 

She explained. Pick a plate, load it up and have it weighed. Okay. We can do that! Go us! There was indeed plenty of choice but as a foodie and a cook, there was actually very little that appealed. Sure, there were plenty of stews and such but they all seemed to be varieties on a theme. We made our selection (2 medium sized plates - not very full and 2 drinks - which the groupon said were included) and went to the till. The bill, nearly$45!! What!?!?! The plates came in at $21 and 16 (and they were *not* full plates!) and the drinks were clearly not included because we still had to pay for them. Now, if the food had been spectacular, I would not have minded at all. I'm more than prepared to pay out for delicious food. But this wasn't. I have had much, much, much better foods and restaurants that don't cater specifically for vegetarians. I can walk into my local Indian (or Chinese) restaurant and get twice the amount of food ( and which will be ten times more delicious!) for the same money that Commensal charged me for strictly mediocre food. 

It's such a shame because I think places like this give vegetarianism a bad name. Vegetarian food *can* be awesome and more-ish and delicious. Just don't expect to get it at Commensal."}
{"text":"Expensive vegetarian takeout, those are the three words that come to mind when I think of Le Comensal. It's got a cafeteria feel, but they do have seating where you can bring your tray of food chosen from a never-ending buffet of goodness after paying for it, but the grand majority of people use it as a take away spot. If you are truly vegetarian though, there isn't a place like it in the city and certainly not near Yonge and Dundas. Plus the cakes and deserts are heaven. If you have the money, it's worth every pricey bite."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, my friend and I were very weary of trying this place, but we bought a Living Social voucher ($17 for $35 worth of food) so we decided to give it a try. I think this place has been given a bad rep.  We went for lunch and quite enjoyed the salads, the spring rolls and the veggie pizza.  We can't comment on the other hot foods as we loaded up on the salads and were too full to go up for a second helping.  BUT, I have to mention, that when we went up to the counter to pay the first time, the cashier informed us that we were $12 under and could go for a second round if we wanted.  Like I said, we were too full after loading up on the salads, the pizza and the spring rolls to have anything else, so that cashier let us grab a to go tray and load up on some desserts for later.  We're not sure whether we would pay full price for what we had, again, we were pleasantly surprised.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm used to vegetarian places going above and beyond on taste and freshness to draw in non-veg folk. This place smashes that stereotype with a fistful of mediocrity. Combine the joyless hog-trough experience of your average Old Country Buffet or nameless Chinese buffet, with the pretentious pricing you'd expect from someplace with hippy inclinations, and you've got Le Commensal. 
I opted for the cheaper hot plate, and picked up small doses of potatoes, seitan, broccoli au gratin, chili, rattatouile, and fried rice. Having not put any of it in my mouth yet, I was contemplating going back for seconds, until the register rang me up at $15. I continued to my table, hoping to get my $15 worth from the taste, but it was not to be. Everything was soggy, bland, and tepid. The rattatouile was indistinguishable from the chili, the broccoli unremarkable, the seitan salty and limp, the potatoes cold, the fried rice utterly without flavor. I shoveled it down and got the heck out of dodge, never to darken their door again. I'm leaving two stars in the assumption that the food probably won't make me sick, but given the chef's obvious apathy, handwashing has to come into question, so I reserve the right to upldate this in about 8 hours if need be. tl;dr - go just about anywhere else."}
{"text":"i went there with my bf..
Food was quite good..and it is health..it is good for the people on the diet...The place didnt good as what i thought...Pretty small and the decoration was soso..Dessert and food you have to pay seperate wwhen we got to cashier...And it is pay by WEIGHT...
got the coupons from the website..you can looked for the website..Pay $12, you can get &20..it is seems on the wagjag.."}
{"text":"Some items were good, others just bland and mushy!!! But for the ridiculous price this restaurant only deserves two stars. Only go if you have a groupon!"}
{"text":"Attention students - amazing Monday deal - 50% off. I discovered this as I was randomly walking by on the way to the library. I filled up a medium container of food for about $10 - which really cost me $5. I did however have to be strategic - potatoes, beets, sweet potatoes will cost you way too much as will cold veggie sticks - not sure why you'd bother with those boring old dishes with all the fun options anyway. I went for the lighter grains and vegetables. They have an awesome ratatouille,veggie lasagna, curries steamed veggies, roasted veggies, quinoa salads, plain salad toppers, etc. The veggie pate is also nice and spicy. Soup is  sold by the bowl. There are two soup options (cream of leek and green lentil on the day I visited), which comes with a free piece of bread. Also, all you yelp oldies - it's 50% off for seniors on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Wish I could put in 2.5/5 stars instead of 3/5. I used to eat here a lot when i worked down the street from this establishment. The food is jusk ok and way over-priced but as a vegetarian with a one hour lunch there was no better place to go for lunch since the food is ready to eat. I would go more for the convenience then for any other reason. 

The manager or owner (not sure which she is) is always so rude and sour faced. It almost made me sick to eat there and know that I am contributing to her success because she didn't even try to care about the people eating there, but again I would eat there as a matter of convenience.

 Any way, I don't work downtown any more and therefore no longer eat here. When I am downtown now its on the weekends and I go to vegetarian places where the food is actually very yummy. 

Also I don't know why people say the food is fresh. Is it really? I am not an expert but it all tastes frozed and out of a box or can to me Anyway, I think the food needs to come down in price, also I think the scale or weighing of the food should be visable and obvious to the customer. I have wondered many times if I am being over-charged. What a weird system."}
{"text":"Great selection, flavourful food, pleasant atmosphere, and fast service at cashier.

Taking advice from previous reviewers, I chose most of the lightweight items instead of large chunks of potatoes. But even then, my bill was not quite what I anticipated. The woman in front of me piled up her plate with carrots and ended up paying over 30 bucks for something she couldve gotten from a supermarket for much less. 

Just remember that both the cold and the hot entrees are around $2.5/lb. Try a bit of everything so you know what your favorite is. I like all of their cold salads and the veggie pate."}
{"text":"This is a pay by weight buffet.  There are certain items that I prefer than others.   I would not classify it as fine cuisine, but would indicated that there are specialty foods: seitan, steamed vegetables, arame, tofu, and ratatouille are just a few.  
A good option for vegetarian food."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here two days in a row...

Like some others have said, the food is great but the price is not. I was happy to get a sample of lots and lots of things, but when my heaping plate broke my bank, I was pretty sad.

The seitan in each of the dishes was cooked great, not chewy or too soft, but just right in the dishes. Lots of great bean dishes and vegan options. The selection of stuff is great, though some items (falafel, veggie roll, pizza) are a lot blander than others. Their drink selection is lackluster, wish there had been more options.

Service was friendly, giving me a 10% discount for no reason on my first visit. The atmosphere is like others have said, like a cafeteria, but hey, what do you expect from a buffet?"}
{"text":"Good vegetarian food. Lots of selection. Very healthy. A little expensive for what you get, but still affordable."}
{"text":"With so any first -rate Vegetarian and vegan spots to hit in Toronto; this place needs to rethink its pricing strategy. The weight it takes out of  your wallet is out of balance.Our group is very veggie educated from years of knoshing at many superb field produce at exclusively organic eateries.  Extensive menu doesn't not mean feast  on the profit margins.Pass on next visit."}
{"text":"Not worth the time or money. 

This is a cafeteria trying to be a restaurant. No ambiance and horribly over priced. Meal for 2 with drinks (non-alcoholic) was $39.00 (we each had 1 moderately loaded plate). Also all the food is served from heating/cooling trays, much of what we picked out was dried out or runny from being out for to long. 

If you eat like a bird..and don't mind the high school cafe experience then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"The first couple of times I visited Le Commensal, I was tickled tofu. A diverse selection floats my boat big time, and also sets my heart a-flutter. Le Commensal is NOT lacking in selection. They've got cold salads, hot casseroles, steamed kale, brown rice, quinoa, lentil salads, salad salads, potatoes and pizza. They've got desserts, juice, wine and coconut water. They've got a vegan version of bourguignon and tons of other concoctions. The selection will knock your face off and you will want to try all of it.

Then you start to get a feel for what's good. You massage your plate tactics and choose nice combos. You begin to think that some of the stuff isn't overly amazing, but A FOR EFFORT, guys. 

Next, like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day, you realize that things never change. You will never NOT see bourguignon on the buffet line. That Moroccan stew will always be there, too. Comforting? Maybe. Disappointing? A bit.

Whenever I'm in the area I like to hit up Le Commensal, but for the taste and the overall price (they charge by weight and my plates are never under $12), not to mention their competition in Camros and Kale Organic Eatery, this spot ranks in at a definite 3 stars."}
{"text":"Went here recently after a workout and boy was I impressed!

I agree with other poster who note that this is restaurant is a wallet buster as the food can easily spiral out of control. Definitely bringing back memories of Froyo trips during the summer =D.

Ended up spending ~30.00 but with the student deal that is on right now it was reduced to 20!! great price for two people and great quality vegetarian cuisine! 

I am a huge fan of the apple and beet salad along with the chinese saiten and the brocolli or fennel gratin which were amazing. notable extras which should not be forgotten are the kashmir rice and the bean salad. =) 

I hope they continue to run this promotion throughout the year as I will become a regular if they do.

3 stars well earned"}
{"text":"My friend and I were very excited to try this place since the website made the restaurant seem so great with such a wide variety. Not much of a variety at all. They had pictures of food on the table and up in the window...none of the food looked like that. I actually wish they had the food that was in the pictures. The hot foods were bland. The quesadillas was weird, it tasted like a mix of cheese and coleslaw, pretty sure coleslaw was in it. Egg noodle with cashew dressing was mushy and so bland, I feel like I wasted my money having that on my plate. Luckily I took only a little bit of everything to get a taste of everything and figure out what was good and what wasn't. Desserts did not look appetizing at all so I steered clear of the dessert section. However there were some items that I liked, such as the lentil salad, spring rolls, chick pea salad, hummus and tabbouleh."}
{"text":"It's a buffet by weight restaurant.  The problem is that it just doesn't taste that good for the price.  Tip:  look for the 30% off days.

Dinner will cost about $18 or more.  Disappointing experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Not vegetarian any more. http://commensal.com/en/restaurants/index.htm

\"Commensal restaurants are evolving and now have become more inclusive than ever. Flexitarians, who practice vegetarianism part time, and carnivores who want to eat healthily, can now garnish their dishes with nordic shrimp, crab from the Maritimes or chicken from Quebec.

\"These tasty new dishes are found in separate sections of the buffet, and identified as Commensal&cie(sic). Vegetarians and vegans can continue to opt for the wide variety of hot and cold dishes they already enjoy.\""}
{"text":"My sisters and I enjoyed the incredible vegetarian and vegan selection, but the food is very pricey. Maybe the quality and selection compensate for the price, but the atmosphere and service certainly don't-- this is cafeteria buffet style!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant maybe once a month for the past few years, and I've generally had very positive experiences here. I also haven't had qualms about bringing friends here (even non-veg friends) - decent quality food for around $10 per plate.

I like that all of the food is generally pretty tasty and very healthy. The cold area has favourites like hummus, vegan pate, and different salads, while the hot area is good as well - I like the seitan dishes but usually get a bit of everything. 

On the whole, I highly recommend this place, especially if you're looking for a healthy and quick meal or for take-away. Maybe not a great place to bring a date, but a welcome change from decidedly noisier places like Fresh.

P.S. A previous reviewer for this restaurant is incorrect regarding the tap water situation at Commensal - they actually do have a dedicated water dispenser with very good, clean water there."}
{"text":"First off, no, I am not a vegetarian, but I do love vegetarian food. So the lack of animal product did not bother me in the least. 

But I do find that veggie restos tend to have skewed ratings because those poor vegans who finally stumble upon a place with decent veg offerings respond with outspoken enthusiasm. And it frustrates me a little since the food at some of these places isn't even as good as vegetarian offerings in non-exclusively veg restos. 

Le Commensal charges ridiculous prices for their food. And as previous reviewers mentioned, it's easy to be skeptical about the scales they use. I am very tempted to go back one day with my own digital scale and test it out, but for now I will let that rest. Even if it was weighed fairly, one plate of cafeteria ratatouille, sweet potato, and beans cost me $20. What.

If you're on a diet, go here. Otherwise, there is simply no excuse. Vegetarians can even go to your standard Indian restaurant and have much better meatless dishes for a portion of the price. 

I will come back if I don't fit into my jeans anymore."}
{"text":"The biggest turn off about this particular establishment was the attitude I got from the cashier and manager. I showed up with Groupon and got the eye roll.. The guy had the guts to take my phone right out of my hands, scrolling through my groupons till he found what he was looking for, then slammed my phone down the counter. Some of the food was OK, but most of it very bland, very disappointing. I love vegetarian and cook it all the time and this is not a place I'd go back to for the food, regardless of who works there. Never again. I just found out ITS CLOSED..?!! THAT IS AMAZING NEWS!!! :)"}
{"text":"One of the main benefits of Le Commensal is the variety - they have a large buffet layout of salads, soups, mains and desserts. All of the food there is vegetarian and i'd hazard a guess that out of all of it at least 3/4 of it is vegan - and well labeled to that effect.

However, while you can enjoy a little bit of a lot of things at Le Commensal, the price will add up. If you know you're on a budget try to pick only a couple of things to try. If you get a nice full plate with a drink, you're looking at somewhere in the vicinity of $20 at least. 

Despite the cost, you're paying for delicious food - a mix of Asian/North American/European food is on offer and there's something to suit everyone's tastes. The food is not bland and not just slop like you may find in some other buffets. For the hot buffet, It's not quite as fresh as it could be (much of the food I assume is pre-prepared or from large batches that they would make their frozen meal products from). I've never had a problem with the salads or desserts however. The menu rarely changes here, so it's always pretty much a safe bet!

If you're not sure if you want something specific - and this does hit the button of \"generic vegetarian food\", in a good way -  then Le Commensal is your thing. Great for a quick lunch, I find - especially if you can get a shady spot on their small patio.

I don't generally go here when i'm eating with my vegetarian or vegan friends, but more often with non-veg friends or colleagues - the fare on offer here has a broad appeal to people who might not be sure about vegetarian food, and there's enough on offer to try that it won't be difficult to get them to enjoy it.

They also have a takeaway option if you want to head off to sit in a park somewhere or dash back to your office with some food. Their frozen/prepackaged food line is also on sale there now too.

Le Commensal, you're pretty good. I think if you could nudge your prices down just a little you could get that fourth star out of me, for all you are worth!"}
{"text":"I went here twice in three days.  I was there in the afternoon, the least busy time and it wasn't.  Maybe two other tables.  I would agree with most of the other reviews.  It gets expensive.  I had a plate for food and a plate for desserts.  It came to $23 which includes a $3 snapple.  I like the idea of all the choices, not having to rely on one item picked off a menu.  I can get spoonfuls of whatever looks good.  The food was very good and the desserts were also very good.  The address was for the main street not the side street that they are really located on.  Being from out of town and walking I had to walk around a bit to see the restaurant down the block.  It was quiet, not to warm or cold, not too crowded and there was a good variety.  It seemed very clean.  I liked the maple sugar pie.  I give them 5 stars for the food and environment, the neighborhood seemed safe too."}
{"text":"A friend of mine had a coupon for $10 off so we decided to give Commensal a try.

The layout reminded me a campus cafeteria. We grabbed our plastic trays, a large plate, and  started on the cold side of the buffet. Lots of different salads (coleslaw, couscous, quinoa, pasta, greek) and raw veggies to pick from.

Once the plate looked 'green' enough, we headed to the hot buffet. Here there were different curries, potato dishes (sweet, mashed, etc.), soups, stews, and grains. 

Flavours are good, but sometimes you can get a cold bite since the hot dishes have been out for a while. There's a water station where you can refill your glass easily.

What attracts me to Commensal is the variety. A small scoop of Tabouli salad here and a few green beans over there. The plate obviously fills up quickly and so does your cost. With the $10 coupon, our two plates came to a total of $16, so estimate about $10-$15 per person. Not bad for a quick lunch and great selection."}
{"text":"You know you're in trouble when previous reviewers are being helpful by telling you how to be strategic while filling your plate.  Le Commensal could be a great little spot, but for the overcooked food and outrageous prices.  

Maybe if I didn't cook, I'd be more tempted by the buffet of stews and salads that Le Commensal offers.  But the truth is, there is little there that we don't make better at home (the seitan excepted).  And the cost is just simply prohibitive.  My husband and I went there because we had a groupon.  He was excited at the possibility of so much choice, since he's usually limited to vegetarian pastas, etc. on restaurant menus.  I got a small-ish plate and he got one with warm stews and rice.  The cost for his medium-sized plate?  $21.  At a cafeteria. We ended up exceeding our $30 groupon by $7 with drinks.  

There are so many great veggie places in Toronto for much better value.  Skip this one.  It's not worth your time.

Vegetarian score: 10/10.  Good variety, bleh outcomes."}
{"text":"I really like the food. It's cafeteria-style, and there is a lot of option in the soup, cold, hot and dessert menus. But this place is absurdly expensive as it's by weight! The hot is cheaper but we got all hot on our plate and the guy charged us a few extra bucks because he thought we had a cold item (which we didn't). ended up having between 2 people: 2 small soups, half a plate of cooked veggies, a sliver of soy cake, and a small grapefruit juice for $36. 
Not horrible, but not worth the $10 parking to stay there and then $36 and leaving hungry. 

Good food, though."}
{"text":"Very good food, good selection - buffet style."}
{"text":"I'm new to vegetarian cuisine, and had no idea that vegetables could be cooked in so many ways!

Ok, I know that sounds ignorant, but I really didn't.  Didn't even know that there were vegetarian-only restaurants!

But now I do, and now we can all rest in peace knowing that there are great healthy meals nearby.

This place is great if you're new to vegetarian cuisine and don't mind just diving into it. Just assume that everything is tofu."}
{"text":"I really don't like to give a low rating to anyone, but before you decide this place is truly a \"2\", at least read a few of the reviews.

PROS:
- It's your choice!  Choose what and how much you want
- A decent amount of choices in terms of types of vegetables (I love sprouts!)
- It's a large enough restaurant that it doesn't feel cramped, and the ambiance is a nice quiet one
- Service is good

CONS:
- The price.  This encompasses many factors, not just a matter of the high price of weighing your food!  I think it's the fact that it is self-serve, my plate is not a chef-made plate, and there's something about having warm food in your stomach for dinner, and the choices for warm food were minimal, but there are tons of fresh vegetables.

So, maybe perhaps this is more of a joint for a nice summer lunch, but I'm not so sure I would come back here again."}
{"text":"I founds this place expensive but good food with a good selection. Not a big fan of the cafeteria feel but I'm willing to put up with it or use their take out option. Overall, there is something for everyone here."}
{"text":"I think this place is better for a lunch excursion, quick and small doses. 
I expected more when I came here based on all the reviews, but my impression was expensive, and complicated. 

Everything here is based on weight, and boy, does it rack up. However, all of us had a average price of around $15 a plate (add more for drinks, but there is free water behind the cash). 

I'm on a strict diet, and I thought that coming to a place like this, there would be good labelling like people have said. All it tells me if whether there is Gluten, Diary, Egg or if it's Vegan. It doesn't give much else in terms of other ingredients, and I needed to know if there was wheat, corn, etc.etc. and no one could tell me with out some confusion and stress. 

I might come here again for a quick bite to eat, but nothing more. It's too difficult and confusing.  but there was a lot of choice. 

Tip: go on their website for $10 coupon for first timers. Share with a friend!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I bought  Groupon for $15 for $30 worth of food for two. As it is a buffet where you pay by weight, $30 seemed like it would be more than enough. I was amazed that after me and my guest took one plate (that were hardly huge or overfilled), we actually had to pay an additional $5 or so.

The food itself was disgusting. Though I'm not a vegetarian, I enjoy fresh vegetarian dishes from time to time. When I bought the Groupon I expected this place to be something like \"Camros Organic Eatery\" (which is delicious by the way!) but it was not at all. This food was not fresh tasting or looking at all. It had clearly been sitting there and I felt sick within a few minutes of leaving the restaurant.

And at these exorbitant prices, how do you not have any wait staff? It's more like a really expensive cafeteria. Even with my voucher, I felt like the value we got for our dinner was terrible. I can't even imagine paying full price for this low quality food."}
{"text":"Good veggie food. Serve yourself and pay by weight.  

The selection is pretty static (the same for years) but enjoyable.

Very easy to rack up a large bill."}
{"text":"Everything that should have been cold was warm. Everything that should have been hot was cold. The beer was skunky. The service was mediocre at best and it was all WAY overpriced."}
{"text":"The Food: very good and satisfying. i'm a 3 year vegetarian and i've been to many veg restaurants in the city, and so far le commensal has presented me with one of the best veg foods, considering the fact that it is buffet styled with a wide variety of food to try. it also doesnt compromise flavour for nutrition, which is another plus.

The Price: Insanely high. dont go here if you're on a tight budget or not that hungry. i'm a small eater, and i even tried to look for the lightest dishes to try. however my bill still came to a whopping $20+  :(

The ambience: its nice and cozy, and it has a huge window next to the dning area, good for people watching :)"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. As many reviewers said, food is usually cold, and VERY expensive. Only worth it with a coupon! 
The woman working there was pretty nice and heated up my food for me. 
Good location"}
{"text":"So let me start out by saying my first Le Commensal experience was in Montreal and it was magical, which is why I was vastly disappointed by my lackluster Toronto experience.  The food itself is delicious, but $24 for a plate of vegetables and tofu?  Not so delicious.  I'm not sure why it is different in Toronto, but the Montreal location caps plates off at $16.99, so not to give you immediate heart failure at the register.  The decor could also use a little sumthin' sumthin', as the Grandma's sunroom vibe pales in comparison to the Montreal chains."}
{"text":"I'm going to break from the generally positive reviews and call BS on what Commensal is offering.

I came in as a first-timer, oblivious to how they price their buffet.  No staff spoke to me, let alone even looked at me, as I sat myself down near a window.  After finishing an article I was reading (maybe 10 minutes), I helped myself to a little salad, sat down, and ate it.  It was then that I noticed there were prices listed for the soup... so, I got up and asked the (now present) cashier if it was included in the buffet.

\"No, it's by the bowl.\"  
\"Oh,\" I reply, \"how about the salad?  I'm a bit confused now -- is the salad buffet separately priced from the rest?\"
\"Yes, it's all by weight.\"
\"Oh, uh... I kinda just ate a salad...\"
\"You did?  Oh...\"
\"Yeah, there's no prices listed anywhere, and nobody was around to ask, and I just kinda assumed...\"
\"Oh, well, everything's by weight; don't worry about the salad.  Just bring your plate to be weighed next time.\"

I felt awfully stupid.  And let me point out that the cashier wasn't so much being understanding and forgiving as she was being completely, unabashedly ambivalent to her job and my embarrassing ignorance.  Just pure apathy.  I hate apathy when eating out.  Show some passion!  I almost would rather she berated me, then called a manager to deal with me for being such a know-nothing tool.  Kick me out or something!  Anything!  (Ok, I'm grateful these things didn't happen...)

So anyway, with the method of payment sorted out, I grab a plate for some hot food.  I pick somewhat sparingly: some broccoli au gratin, fennel au gratin, a bit of steamed kale, and, as an afterthought, a spring roll (upon noticing how kinda empty my plate looked).  Weighed Price:  Just shy of $16.  

*blink blink*  Whazu???  I mean, if the food was delicious, sure, justified!  But no, it was sitting out, overcooked, mushy.  The spring roll was just plain bad, like an M&M Meats multi-pack spring roll.  I came in shortly after noon, and the food looked and tasted as if it had been out all night.  (And was she counting the weight of my plate?  Yeesh!)

Y'know, I blame myself.  I should have looked at the buffet offerings, shrugged, and left.  Bad food is pretty easy to spot, especially on a buffet, and in hindsight I knew I was going to be disappointed as soon as I slopped that stuff down on my plate.

My solace?  Groupon Now! dropped my price to $12.  But man, if it weren't for that damned Groupon I wouldn't have come in...  I ate a little piece of cake to drive my cost to a hair over $20 and use up my Groupon (over $4 for a small slice of gelatinous cake... man... I'm getting ripped off and I'm not even paying full price...)

Can't win 'em all, I guess.  I won't be back.  One star for mushy food, ridiculous pricing (steamed kale = fennel au gratin? riiiight), and soul-sucking apathy."}
{"text":"blech. i don't know what vegetarian decided that they were missing out on the warming tray trend but its definitely something i could live without. the food here is very low quality and the warming trays only keep it lukewarm. when i went, the dessert stand was covered in flies. since they charge out the ass for drinks, i asked the lady at the checkout for a cup of tap water. she pointed behind her to a dirty sink with half-washed glasses. 

i got a sampling of a bunch of different foods, but the only thing that was vaguely edible was the lasagna. 

the reason i'm giving it two stars is because my husband actually likes his food out of warming trays. he thought this place was ok, but i'm definitely never going back."}
{"text":"A vegetarian restaurant that sells food in a buffet-style 'by weight' system.  You grab a plate, put as much of whatever you want on it, and pay based upon how much food is on there.  It's a vegetarian restaurant, and it sells quality food, but it's also something that you will pay dearly for.  As much as I'd like this place to be a regular hang out spot, I don't think it's particularly affordable.

You will experience live jazz music most Friday or Saturday nights, with instruments ranging from piano to sax to voice and several in between, either as solo performances or in combos of 2 or 3 people.

They have a decent wine list, with a bottle of the cheaper stuff being in the range of $20-$25, and the expensive stuff being... well, it's wine.  It's expensive."}
{"text":"Good food, plenty of yummy options, I can't even pick a favorite because I always just try for a bunch of different things.
I'm cool with the cafeteria style of the place since I like choosing how much I want of this or that. 
I'd say try filling up you're plate with more salads or lighter things, otherwise the cost could be really driven up."}
{"text":"This place has great veg, vegan and gluten free options in a cafeteria style setting. They have hot and cold sections, as well as dessert. I didn't get a beverage, but they all seemed like organic/healthy choices. Coffee has free refills. 

As Michelle A. already said, be strategic when you are filling up your plate! I stuck with the quinoa salad, couscous and a melange of pre made salads. Loading up on items like the potato salad (although it looked good!) could cause some damage to your lunchtime spending money. Everything I had was really good and tasted like it was good AND good for you. 

Obviously being the pseudo cheapskate that I am,  I went on a Monday. The 50% on monday deal is good for both students and university staff. You just have to show your ID card and the deal is on."}
{"text":"I went with a friend and used my Teambuy.ca voucher ($17 for $35 worth of food). Before purchasing this deal I already done my research and read reviews on Yelp. Even before stepping into Le Commensal, my interpretation was this place was either a hit or miss. 

Unfortunately this place was a miss or wait, did they even shoot the arrow? 
CONS:
- The atmosphere was dark (not all the lights were turned on) and it was prime time for dinner (We were there around 6PM). The poor lighting made the food look pretty sad. 
- Everyone on Yelp raved about selections. Seriously?! The selection was NOT as much as I would have imagined (most of the food look the same with a minor colour and veggie difference). If you go to a typical buffet like Mandarin there are more selections. 
- Price - If you checked out my pictures you will be amazed on how little food we got for $35. Thank god  I used a coupon and I didn't pay full price. I could easily spend less money @ Fresh, Kings Cafe, etc and get better quality food and I actually feel nourished. 
- Taste - HOT BUFFET are meant to be \"Hot\", right? Well at Le Commensal not all the food are \"that hot\". I tried one of their dishes and it was lukewarm. AVOID the un-meat ball, it hurt my teeth. SUGGESTION - Don't just cook and fill up the buffet IF NO ONE is there. Cook as you see people coming in so its ACTUALLY fresh.  
- Taste P2. - COLD BUFFET was a huge disappointment. Nothing out of the ordinary here. I could have easily bought those items at Metro, Loblaws or some specialty store for less (and better quality) and enjoy it outdoors or at the food court.  

PRO: 
- Dessert - Thank God the dessert was good, although it may look quite unappetizing (no wonder its more expensive too). The date square = Thumbs up. 
(Did you noticed the PRO, and not PROs because there's only ONE PRO) 

THE VERDICT 
RELATIONSHIP PROSPECTIVE - If you are looking for a place to show your date/enemy/hated ex or friend a bad time, take them to Le Commensal. You will enjoy the fact they will pay a heft price to eat very little and if you help them scoop a couple of \"Un-meat balls\" you will see them suffer as they will have no idea whats stuck inside their mouth.  
DEAL PROSPECTIVE - I seen this deal on GroupOn before and now on Teambuy. I am certain it will be on another daily deal platform. If you're a true deal-logist  this is not the deal for you. 
HEALTH PROSPECTIVE - If you are looking to shed some pounds because you're wallet is too heavy - Le Commensal is your answer. 
REPEAT BUSINESS - No I don't see myself going back to Le Commensal. During my brief time there I actually wanted to tell the staff \"The food here's really bad, have you tried them before?\". I really don't get like that people! First time in my life."}
{"text":"A great idea, but the place is a) filthy, b) dramatically understocked (and I was there at an early dinner hour, 6 pm), and c) outrageously expensive (far more than the Toronto Whole Foods hot food bar). Like a dirty cafeteria with table-service prices for food of questionable cleanliness and age. I love vegetarian food, but this was a huge disappointment. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"I would be the last person to suggest a vegetarian place, but the company was worth it. The place was quiet and enjoyable place to have lunch. Price is and the food was good. Might consider going back again."}
{"text":"Over the years, Le Commensal has been a favourite place to go when I'm looking for a quiet place to have a heart-to-heart.  In the past, I've dined here before attending musicals at the Canon Theatre.  It's also a good place to stop if you're tired from shopping at the Eaton Centre. 

The food is set out cafeteria-style; the hot food is pretty tasty, but it doesn't take an idiot to realize that some of it is recycled through the week.  There are attendents flit about to take your plates away but won't pester you for tips. Take as much as you need, everything is charged by weight and convenient if you just want a quick nibble.  Echoing Kat's review, be careful not to take the heavy items as it gets pretty expensive!

All dishes are clearly marked to show which are vegetarian/vegan, lactose-free or gluten-free. This is also one of the few vegetarian places where you can get seitan, often offered in two different styles. The salad bar offers live sprouts, seaweed, nuts and seeds and lots of greens to munch on. 

For dessert, I always get two things: the poppyseed log cake and the vegan coffee cake. If you're in the mood, fruit and cream are available to add on top. There are cookies and nut bars as well. 

DISCOUNTS: Make use of the 10% discount if you're a Toronto Vegetarian Association cardholder, or print a $5 (with a minimum purchase of $30) coupon off their website. You can also eat for free on your birthday if you bring a friend. For late-night diners, there is 20% off after 8:30 pm on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.

PARKING: The street here often gets ticketed, so make sure you pay if you're parked on the street. Daytime parking underground is ridiculously expensive. However, after 6 pm, underground parking can be validated."}
{"text":"TAKE A PASS

In general, the food was OK. The variety was decent, however the business practise of \"paying by weight\" focuses on filling your plate with salad, and not the variety of food that the website menu discusses. If it was a true \"all you can eat\", we would have loved to try the variety, but due to the weight constraints, we had to settle. 
We went because of a DealFind offer that stated \"$15 for a Vegetarian Dinner Buffet for 2 at Commensal (Up to $30 Value)\". When you read this, or the rest of the offer found here, http://www.dealfind.com/toronto/commensal-vegetarian-restaurant, there's nothing about how it's not an all-you-can-eat buffet. The value was spent way too quickly, as the $2.40 per 100 grams doesn't allow for true variety that a buffet should allow for. 
There is no wait staff...in fact, the only staff we saw were the cashiers at the end of the line. Imagine Ikea...but without the kitchen staff, and plastic forks."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, but too expensive. The previous reviews covered most of it. You serve yourself cafeteria style and then pay by weight. Hint: chickpeas are a quick way to weigh your plate down, so go easy on them."}
{"text":"Years ago when I was vegetarian, I knew some vegans who raved about this place. So one day I went to dinner here with a vegetarian friend of mine before a show... The food tasted fairly fresh, and there was a lot of choice, but I would say it was all pretty uninspired. Also, I'm not a huge fan of places that charge by the weight. My friend who was a girl I think had a much smaller plate, and maybe her meal was more affordable for what she got, but my plate was in the 20 dollar range, and I didn't feel like I had a 20 dollar meal. Most of the dishes are salads that could easily be made at home... I think this place only survives because it caters towards a specific market."}
{"text":"compared to other vegetarian buffets I've been to where most things are raw, this place sells a much wider variety of vegetarian food. hot dishes also, and different dishes from different countries. I like it here."}
{"text":"So today I tried to inquire about the weighing and tarring system for the large vs small plate and they said \"Oh I just push one button for small plates and one for large\"...I am however still skeptical and I will continue to pile my small plate mile high. This seems to get you the most bang for your buck. That is all."}
{"text":"The worst meal of my life. EVERYTHING was bland, unimaginative, barely warm and really expensive. I'm surprised they are still in business."}
{"text":"Vegetarian heaven, especially for those of us stuck in the not-so-friendly-to-vegetarians Midwest. Amazing selection, good food. Only down side is that it's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"We went here because of the great reviews, but the entire time was full of disappointment.

When we read, \"vegetarian buffet\", we were stoked.  Visiting from Missouri, we don't often find vegetarian buffets, the last one I went to was in Houston, TX.  It's not that we want to eat our weight in food, it's the idea of getting to try several different items in small servings, maybe go back and get a little more of the one that you loved the most.

Do that here and you'll go broke.

The buffet is sold by weight, so you get a dense, heavy or wet item and you pay big.  Or, if you get a tiny sampling of several things, same problem.  The food is kept up nice enough, but no better than any other buffet I've been to.  The QUALITY of food is pretty great but not everything had much of a flavor or ended up being cold instead of warm, or warm instead of cold, and then you literally are throwing money away.

When you check out you have the option of starting a tab so you can go back and forth, get a second helping, get dessert, whatever.  That's great, but they don't exactly advertise it which seems awfully weird.  The first option is to pay per trip, which can be quite the hassle, especially if paying in cash.

In the last hour that they are open, you can get your meal for 20% off.  

Sounds great until you try to close out your tab and they won't honor it.  No where does it say, \"20% off when you pay per trip to the buffet line, not applicable to tabs.\"  So when we checked out, my b/f ended up having to pay full price for his meal and I, after some coaxing with the cashier, got mine for the 20% off.

The staff really keep to themselves, knowing we were first timers I'd hoped they would provide some guidance, but instead we got lectured on which plates handle which foods, that you don't mix a dessert item, no matter it was one bite of a piece of cake, on the same plate as your entree.

Oh, and regarding the \"half washed cups\" for water... Vanessa v. hit the nail on the head.  Our cups were gritty and foggy, not something you'd see coming out of a Cascade commercial selling JetDry.  Pretty gross really.

They advertise that the average bill is $18 for dinner.  That seemed kind of high to us but we were willing to give it a try.  

Our bill?  ~$25 each.  We didn't eat our weight in vegetables here, just tried a little of several items, some of which we couldn't eat due to their flavor or temperature.

In the end, I would recommend this place if it's your birthday, apparently they give a free birthday lunch/dinner... but only if you bring someone else who is eating.  Oh, and maybe there is a catch there too, who knows.

The food was ok, the service was merely meh, the price was over the top and the atmosphere felt like a high school cafeteria."}
{"text":"THE MENU:  There isn't a menu per se since this place is buffet style .   Buffets have such a bad rep, because we immediately think of Mandarin Chinese Restaurants that are teeming with fried foods.   Not here.  Commensal is a vegetarian buffet that also offers gluten-free, egg-free and dairy-free menu items.  There are 3 sections:  Hot Buffet (chili, lasagna, tofu, stirfries, etc), a Cold Buffet (salads, fresh veggies) and Dessert Buffet (cakes, cookies, puddings).   Each buffet item is labelled to make the experience a breeze for any with food restrictions.  

MY ORDER:   I started with my usual pre-scanning of all the choices, scoping out those with the \"GF\" label.  You want to make sure you know what's on the buffet menu so you can leave enough room for everything you want to try.  Tonight my stomach and I didn't have the patience to scan all the buffet  items.  We wanted some food. Now!  So I randomly started scooping anything that caught my eye into my takeout container.  

I know many people who prefer their foods compartmentalized into individual sections, and are probably cringing at the sight of my meal.  As you can tell, I'm not particularly anal about different foods touching each other.  My hot veggies are spilling onto my cold lentil salad.  And the curry sauce is starting to blend with the tomato-based ratatouille.   It's all the same to me.  Won't look much better once it's in our belly:)  

Lentil Salad - This was one of many prepared salad options.  Potato salad, bean salad, grain salads, beet and apple salad.  I could go on and on.  Lentils were my choice because they are high in iron and being anemic, my naturopath suggested I eat more of them. 

Steam Veggies - I love that the veggies are lightly cooked.  They aren't boiled to death and don't fall apart when you touch them. 

Ratatouille - This is a wonderful blend of stewed eggplant, bell peppers, onions, and other veggies in a thick tomato sauce.  This was a staple while growing up so I always gravitate to it when I'm here.

Tofu Curry - I'm a saucy person and Commensal offers a good variety of saucy dishes like curries, stews, chilis.   Some with seitan (a wheat protein), others with tofu or simply veggies.  The one thing they're lacking is tempeh (fermented soy that's better for you).  I'll have to look into this."}
{"text":"This place is a recipe for fiscal disaster. It's a cafeteria style buffet, where you are charged by weight (your foods', not your own). This is easily forgotten as you pick out nibbles and soon you are walking up the cashier, hefting your plate --as if that tells you anything-- and wondering, sweet God how much am I going to pay for this tofu?

As it turns out: quite a bit. With a Blanche de Chambly my total came to $18 bucks, and I didn't get THAT much food. But what I did get was quite tasty. There is too much to list, but I'll point out the Seitan Bourguignon, it's delicious. The selection is fantastic, but I can't see myself going back soon. It's just too expensive.

Obligatory Title Pun: VEG out at Commensal!

Menu Readability: All the buffet items are clearly abelled, so you know what contains eggs, dairy, and what is 100% vegan.

Need to mention: So, they have two plate sizes here, but it didn't look like they had a clear way to tare the scale for plate size.  So.... get the smaller plate. (Correct me if I'm wrong.)

What this place teaches me about myself: Commensal teaches me that I could probably live as a vegetarian, but it would require a supplemental income."}
{"text":"Great food with an impressive selection of pretty much ANY vegetarian food you'd ever hope to try (wild rice, lentils, shepherd's pie, chili, lasagna, pizza, various salads and vegan desserts) but watch out - just because it's \"by weight\" doesn't mean it won't be pricey. The average plate ends up costing about $14-18 so try not to load up on too many heavy things or you'll be in for a surprise when you go to cash out!"}
{"text":"There is a wide variety of good vegetarian restaurants in Toronto. One of our favourite is Le Commensal! We have been going for years and we still keep going back.

Le Commensal is buffet/cafeteria style restaurant. You serve yourself and pay by weight. There are lots of options for soups, beverages, salads, hot and cold dishes and sweets! The dishes change daily but remain largely the same over the years. Some of the dishes even come in frozen packages so you can take them home and stack them in the freezer. Just heat them up and you are ready to enjoy the hot dishes!

We always fill our plates sky high because there are just so many dishes that we want to try. I absolutely love their salads. It's fresh, wholesome and delicious!  My favorite hot dish is the Thai Seitan for its sweet and sour taste. The Ma Po Tofu is not too spicy but flavorful. I especially like to pick out the cute little champagne mushrooms because they are so chewy and tender!

Also, I really appreciate that they label all the dishes accordingly. The labels tell you whether a dish has dairy or egg or it's gluten free. There are tons of different choices; from veggie pizza to sushi to curry to quiche. They have something from every cuisine.

Remember to save some room desserts! Chocolate cake, lemon pie, oatmeal raisin coockies.... you name it! Now they also have a breakfast bar which opens at 7:30am. If you go late at night, you can also enjoy 20% off. It's a lovely place to enjoy some live jazz in the summer time."}
