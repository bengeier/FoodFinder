{"text":"worst service of any asian restaurant, arrogant and treats their customers like crap. their food is bland and MSG-filled (my friend started twitching afterwards WTF)."}
{"text":"I love Szechuan, and Tao is in my neighborhood.  It's great to be able to go out for dinner on impulse and still indulge in Szechuan cuisine.  That is what my husband and I did last night.  I have been to Tao before, but not lately.  I think the quality has not changed over the past year or more.  It is solidly 3-star: average for this kind of food.  Given that it was an impulsive outing and nearby, I am happy with that. About Tao: the service was slow at first, but once the waitstaff discovered us they were sufficiently attentive, and certainly very nice.  We sat inside, but there is also outside seating (it was full), and both are pleasant.   I am addicted to peanut sauce and to crispy spinach, so I was determined to have both if possible.  I got the peanut sauce in vegetarian Hunan dumplings: good, but I've had better.  We ordered the crispy spinach as a side dish.  I've had crispy spinach that sent me into rhapsodies and this one did not, but it was good.  There were quite a few stems in it, which I have not noticed in this dish before.   There were several vegetarian choices, and all looked good so it was a difficult choice.  I finally chose tofu with yellow curry sauce and Asian green vegetables.  There were a lot more yellow/orange vegetables than green ones -- mainly yellow pepper slices -- but the sauce was good and the dish was totally acceptable.  Again, everything was good but nothing was great.  My husband had a shrimp dish, and he found it good.  Tao gives you a couple of almond cookies and some candied pecans after dinner -- very generous of them, and a lovely ending to the meal. We did not order a bottle of wine because my husband wanted a beer, so I had a glass of wine. I chose a Cote du Rhone -- very good. Overall, we were happy with our neighborhood dinner and I fully intend to go back."}
{"text":"Very disapointing. This used to be a very good restaurant. I don't know what has happened- if it's under new management or what, but we  used to go there all the time and it was great. But now... it is anything but.  The ribs were boiled in water and tasteless, the general tao was really hard and the sauce really overly salty. The fried shrimp was okay, but the sauce was the exact same as the general tao sauce. Kind of weird.  Also, we ordered some steamed rice and some sticky rice, and though it came in different shaped bowls it was the same rice (and both were over cooked and mushy)."}
{"text":"Ordered this for takeout and it was literally the biggest let down ever! \"Orange\" beef was literally just VH honey garlic sauce... OVERPRICED, BLAND & NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY! Not to mention we were missing items; ordered 2 egg rolls and received 1 spring roll instead? Words cannot even express how bad this was... I'd rather eat food court Chinese food over this."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight with my wife and 2 friends. Ordered #8 on their Evening Menu (General Tao). It came in a big dish and a small cup of rice. The bill for 4 for General Tao, Chinese beef brocolli, pineapple chicken, fried rice and 4 coffee came close to $80 excluding the tip. Very very expensive for Chinese dinner. You pay for ambiance rather than the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Prices are a bit high but food is good. I will try to find another reasonable price Szechuan food restaurant however!"}
{"text":"Came here with my parents last night.  One advantage about this place is that it has a very comfortable decor, leather booths, soft classical music, and ramps to make it easier for older people to climb the stairs.    The food was quite expensive.  The \"Shredded duck soup\" was a bland broth with small chunks of duck.  The two noodle dishes we ordered had the same sauce - very salty - too much soya sauce.  The Chinese beer we ordered had to be chilled so we had to wait for it.  All in all, the food was the quality of a neon sign Chinese diner, but more expensive.  I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the area because I think it's the only Chinese food in the area. Hop on the metro and head to Chinatown, this place is expensive and really nothing special."}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised by the negative reviews here. While I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's the best dining experience in the city, it's pretty adequate and even great when it comes to a few of their dishes. The service is also pretty unbeatable, with extremely attentive and kind staff who are quick to take your order and answer any questions. The decor is well done and the is atmosphere is relaxed upscale. It's great for families and seems to have its regulars.  The food is hit or \"meh\" but no one in my group had anything they were unhappy with. The portions are generous and you definitely won't leave hungry if you order the reasonably priced table d'hote. We were a group of four. The soups that came with our meal were good- the spinach and ginger is such a pleasant surprise! Highly recommended. The appetizers that followed (dumplings and spring rolls) were also very nice. One of us ordered the lobster special and said that it was easily one of the best lobster dishes he's had in the city! The beef noodles I ordered were also pretty great. The crispy duck and peanut sauce chicken ordered by the others were just alright but still enjoyable.   We finished off with some fried bananas and a plate of cookies and candied nuts that seem to be their specialty. They were all just fine.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come again, but if I'm hungry and passing by I wouldn't hesitate to go in!"}
{"text":"I ordered this through UberEATS hoping that I had found a solid Chinese resto in the area. I'm not sure if they are affiliated with Tao on Victoria, whom I've had years ago and pretty much enjoyed, but this was really bad. Super bland and really nothing was enjoyable. They forgot to deliver our 2nd egg roll, my fav part of the meal was the one bite I was able to take of my wife's portion. Peanut butter dumplings had very little sauce, orange beef was accompanied by honey garlic sauce, salt and pepper shrimp were okay, shrimp dumplings were flat out gross and chow mein was the blandest bowl of noodles I had ever eaten. Never again!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out from this restaurant and I had their chicken chop soy noodles which was delicious. I have been inspired by their flavours and consistency. The portion is huge and so filling for what you pay. The receptionist was so nice and made me wait. I got my order within 10 minutes and it was fresh. At the first bites, I loved the fact that it was healthy and not too oily. I'd recommend it to everyone as the food is good. Would return"}
{"text":"We've been delivery customers of Tao for the past 2 years. Their food has always been as good, if not better than most delivery food. In the past we've had the food at our door within 20 minutes, despite the given 30 - 45 min by the person taking the order, and the delivery person was always incredibly friendly. In the fall Tao moved to a new location and merged with our other delivery go-to, Red Ginger (same quality food and same prompt delivery from even further away). Not long after the move, we placed a delivery order and were told it would be 45-60 minutes. Okay, since they were maybe adjusting to the new location. 2+ hours and 3 calls later our food arrived, at 9:30pm, with no apologies from the person I spoke to on the phone or the delivery person. \"It's really busy\", was the stock response. Somehow, the food was hot and tasted fine, but the wait and service left a bad taste in my mouth (excuse the pun). I had not ordered from them since, but was in the mood and decided to give it a try last night. An hour and 10 minutes later and no apology (or words of any sort) from the delivery person, my food arrived. The person taking the order did say it would be 45 - 60 minutes, so it was only a bit over that. I just don't know how it's taking over an hour, on a Tuesday, when I live a 5 minute drive away. Perhaps I was spoiled by their previously quick delivery, which always came much sooner than they said it would. All that being said, the food is good, but if you're looking for a quick delivery...this is not it."}
{"text":"Waited one hour to arrive. Food horrible. Worse Chinese food I've had. The chow mien was absolutely tasteless. Did they forget sauce?  No rice included. Don't recommend this place"}
{"text":"TLDR: Great spot for a table d'hote.  The restaurant is two in one, Tao and a vegan one which I hope to try soon.  The ginger spinach soup is a light delicate chicken broth, flavoured with ginger and garnished with spinach and I believe water chestnuts (I'm not sure, it's something white and crunchy). The hot and sour soup is perfectly balanced.  The Hunan dumplings are a tasty and satisfying treat for someone who enjoys dishes with peanut sauce.  The sizzling Thai basil beef really does come in a sizzling plate and is garnished with mushrooms, asparagus, and snow peas. The crispy duck is also delicious.  The meal ends with delicious cookies and candied walnuts which are out of this world.  The service is attentive and efficient. Tao is a wonderful and refreshing family restaurant in the NDG area."}
{"text":"Great service and good food. Loved the veggie rice paper rolls The general tso was great. Asparagus with double mushrooms was not great because too many woody asparagus pieces and hardly any mushrooms.."}
