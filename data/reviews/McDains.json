{"text":"Poor service, gummy shrimp,uncooked vegetables, no bread and this was on a slow night. The only good thing is that it was quiet without the noisy children."}
{"text":"McDain's, growing into the valley's hidden gem.

For people who think that McDain's is just for golf, you are missing something very enjoyable. Not crazy unique food, just the usual cast of characters. Marsala's, Chicken Salads, Stuffed Flounder & Sandwiches. I have had them all, but this review is for the last on that list, the Sandwiches!

Tonight I dined with my culinarian com padre AP and my mother. What drew us there  this evening was the email for 1/2 OFF NEW SANDWICHES, Aug 14-19th. Not that I am a coupon collecting jedi, but it did it's effectiveness, and got our asses in the door. 

My mother went with the Grilled Steak, AP with the blackened salmon, and I with the Double Eagle Burger. AP did not decide to go the sandwich route, but me and the mom did. Her grilled steak sandwich is solid as ever, loaded with real meat, cheese, and topped with bacon. *Jedi Recommendation: Mayo, and cooked no more than medium. Like I said, solid choice.  But now for mine....the NEW Double Eagle Burger.

My eyes were drawn to this item on the menu, like a bad car accident. A 1/3 pound real meat burger (by the way, burgers are always bomb here) topped with jumbo lump crab cake (in which them shits too are bomb in themselves) finished with a homemade remoulade sauce. Now I know what your thinking...RED MEAT and CRAB...WTF...but listen to me, with the remoulade it works like a think of beauty. I personally feel that it needs some crunch so *Jedi Recommendation: and either some dill pickle or even just some spring mix for a texture enhancer. I will order this burger again, delicious!

RESTAURANT BOUNS: no kids in under 6.....LOVE IT. It you wanna bitch, go to Chuck E Cheese with dem lil snots. (no offense parents, just like to eat in some peace)

{"text":"Took a vacation to Pittsburgh last month - after finding out about the ban on children under 6, my companion & I decided it was worth planning one of our nights around. After a tumultuous trip, we arrived & were greeted with very pleasant staff & ambience. Companion ordered chicken marsala with some coleslaw, which was pretty delightful, and I had beer battered chicken with fries & a tomato bisque - also quite good. Our waitress was quite prompt & observant of our needs, and the food came out in reasonable time.  Definitely no complaints there.

Overall, it was slightly pricier than I'd anticipated for what we ordered, but it was worth it to eat in peace sans screaming, food-covered, bratty children. I wish more restaurants would adopt a no-kids policy; I'd eat out more."}
