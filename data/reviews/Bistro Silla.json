{"text":"Pizza/bistro right around the corner from Notre Dame in Montreal, and it has a little outdoor deck on the street. The prices are reasonable, the food is not very good, we got pizzas and beer. It was ok."}
{"text":"Couldn't get into Robin Square so we ended up here because it was essentially empty. The $17 lasagna was just a small square of ordinary lasagna on a plate, that was it. Our red wine was off but was replaced but waiter forgot to bring glass of white wine we ordered. The Caprese salad was also not very good."}
{"text":"Came here for a quiet dinner after a long day. I had a Caesar salad that tasted old (it was probably made in the morning and kept in the fridge) and a pasta primavera which tasted average, at the point that I did not eat it all. Very overpriced, average service."}
{"text":"In Montreal for a conference and stopped in for a bite. Get the table by the window and watch the people stroll by. I had a salad and pollo panini  the Caesar is good too."}
{"text":"They provided excellent service, and the food was wonderful. We all had pizza or pasta.   The Alfredo with penne pasta was great and it wasn't too much!   The pizza was excellent - margarita was the one we chose!"}
{"text":"Very nice Italian restaurant with excellent service.  Their Caesar salad is amazing with some of the best shrimp!  Their Sicilian pizza is also very good.  The ambiance of this nice restaurant is also very good."}
{"text":"Nice little reprieve from the touristic craziness outside.   Sit down.  Have a glass of wine.  And enjoy something much healthier than fast food.   Service was really nice and this place is super cute.   Recommended!!"}
{"text":"This is a highly underrated place.  Daily menu has a great diversity.  The sole was fantastic.  The salads fresh and the pasta portions were appropriate.  The service was attentive and atmosphere was good for families, couples and friends dining out."}
{"text":"In Montreal for a long weekend and after a long day of walking my wife and I wanted a light meal/break.  This place was perfect and hit the mark.  A pretty thorough \"light fare\" menu (it was not there dinner menu).  Our server (Maryjo) was excellent and fun (she had a very good sense of humor) and treated us non-French speaking Americans with grace.  A small but quaint place, we really enjoyed it and would visit again."}
{"text":"We were wandering around old town on a rainy evening looking for a place to eat because the place we had targeted to eat at is closed on Monday.  We came across Bistro Silla and the menu looked like what we needed.   Our server was warm and friendly, the restaurant was clean and comfy. My pasta was a perfect aldente."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and ambiance! I would definitely recommend this resto for great Italian food."}
{"text":"We came into this restaurant because of a sudden rain.  And I've decided that I would never ever do that again no matter what!  It was ridiculously overpriced: a shrimp pesto $22, and a sausage pizza $18.  The pesto was oily and tasteless and cheese on the pizza was like flour.  The only good part about this restaurant was the deco.  It was an awful catering experience and I would never go back for the food again."}
{"text":"My wife and small son and I were visiting from Maine.  Our first evening in town we were strolling around looking at the sights and came upon the Bistro.  My son still is somewhat limited in his tastes. He had a small pizza and loved it.  My wife had salmon that was perfectly prepared. I had a pasta with pesto that was light and full of flavor.  Our waitress was lovely and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves"}
{"text":"Amazing food in the heart of Montreal.  Excellent Italian food in an authentic atmosphere.  For appetizers we shared salciccia (sausage) which was a lovely opener, nice level of spice, tasty meat and came on a rocket salad bed.  We had the spaghetti bolognese and Mrs R the vongole and both were delicious.   Pasta was perfectly cooked, the bolognese meat was nicely done and lean and portion sizes just right for a nice hearty lunch. Service was good and we a terrific meal.  We didn't have wine (unfortunately), just water this time and the bill Would certainly recommend!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food and service! Easily the best caprese salad I've ever had and the restaurant itself was cozy and intimate with very nice employees. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for good authentic Italian in old Montreal!"}
