{"text":"I stopped in here on a whim. When you first open the door of the casino it has a very strong cigarette smell, but inside the restaurant no issue at all. I was seated by a friendly girl who informed me the prime rib special that night was $5.55. That's old school Vegas pricing which is hard to find these days. The menu is your standard diner fare offering up a little bit of everything. I chose the meat loaf and the wife got fried chicken. Both dishes were better than I would have imagined, and the portions were huge. Both dinners included a small dinner salad. Our server Rose was fast, friendly, and attentive. I'm new to the area and never visited the old Klondike, but I will definitely return if I want some tasty diner food at a more than fair price."}
{"text":"I have heard amazing reviews about this place for their breakfast but my family and I decided to try it out for a late lunch. I ordered the $5.55 prime rib special. Granted, at that price, I wasn't expecting anything too spectacular for the quality of meat. The meal came with salad, your choice of potato and a veggie side. The salad tasted like the lettuce sat in the fridge for awhile and absorbed the smells. When I received my meal, the potatoes were  rubbery and were \"instant\" potatoes (fake dehydrated stuff that comes in a box). I asked for no gravy and it was served with gravy which didn't help the rubbery texture. The \"prime rib\" was reheated and I believe it was a different cut of meat than prime rib. The green beans were over-cooked and very soft. I would not recommend coming here for the prime rib special."}
{"text":"It's a clean greasy spoon. The sour dough toast I ordered taste and looks a lot like wheat :-/

I come for the breakfast. 1.50$ two eggs two sausage and a changing portion size on hash browns. The coffee is good. The food taste good. The biggest down side is the lingering smell of the old Klondike. 

Update.....been coming here for awhile now, the breakfast specials are great. Worth it. Unfortunately, once the check arrives, forget about any continuous service. After sitting with the coffee mugs towards the far end of the table waiting for refills, it felt like they were done with us."}
{"text":"Cheap and Slow, food is good for the price. A bit slow getting around to you after you get seated. Been in twice for breakfast and we both ate for way under 12.00 wit a 5.00 tip. Just good cheap breakfast fare."}
{"text":"Came in around 1am for some food. Ordered 11pm til special. Prime rib and eggs. Portions are small and food hot. Server was great. Could be the go too spot for late night before heading to hotel. We will see on aecond visit."}
{"text":"Came in yesterday, (April 1st 2017)  we got seated right away , but it took 10 min to get our drink orders. 

And another 6 to get out food order.

The server was confused on me being vegan  so I explained.


Even though I explained , I still got sour cream on the side.

The burrito was good
(hash brown were VERY  greasy )

The pico had hardly NO tomatro. It was all onion. . I am guessing due to the high cost of tomatoes.  But it was fresh.

Bummed though because they were out of Banana Cream pie AND churros.(  both yesterday and today).

The server DID not check on us , except when we were ready to pay.

Nice light decor and phone plugs at each table.

GREAT PRICES.

This experience was the same both days .

Yesterday and today .
(Today we bought hubby)."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Few issues but were fixed. Service was a little iffy. Did enjoy the area was super clean."}
{"text":"I didn't realize it before going, but this is inside a casino.

Food was ok. Service not so great."}
{"text":"I love the food and the service....
Great prices great food.
As a note the returns on gambling are amazing and I always leave with money in my pocket and a full stomach...
This truly is how  Vegas used to be."}
{"text":"Got the $4.99 breakfast special Chicken Fried Steak. Tender enough to use a fork. The gravy was amazing. BF got the $5.99 Steak and Eggs. Tender quality meat and cooked exactly as he asked.

Definitely look forward to more meals here. Great prices. Great food."}
{"text":"Great food great prime rib food portions  humongus Service phenomenal  love this place"}
{"text":"You can't beat the $1.49 breakfast two eggs,potatoes and bacon or sausage. The coffee is more than food $2.25. We go a couple times a week  we have also have the lunch specials I get the spaghetti and meatballs there is enough for two people for $3.50."}
{"text":"Hidden gem serving better than average diner fare.

We started with the Twice Baked Cajun Wings & their bottomless breadstick basket. Cajun is the style, not flavor, so we got to choose our flavor. Upon the advise of our server Mateo, we got the garlic parmesan...10 absolutely yummy baked wings with bits of roasted garlic pieces. The breadsticks were soft and warm, and fresh! Not microwaved, so they didn't get hard when they cooled off & remained soft. Served with butter, but I preferred to poke it on the wings plate to get those yummy bits of garlic instead. Oh yeah!

We ordered the Tilapia Francaise & Meatloaf entrees. Tilapia was a garlic lemon butter creation of awesomeness...with LOTS of garlic bits, so you better like garlic or ask for an alternative to the way it's prepared if you don't. Luckily for us, we were down for it. Meatloaf was homemade and came with two generous slices crisped on the flat-top, with mushroom gravy. Some places slather with \"eh\" tasting gravy, but their mushroom gravy was really good (lots of button mushroom slices and not over salted at all).

Both dinners came with soup or salad (both good), veggie of the day (nice fresh green beans cooked perfectly, still crunchy and good), and choice of potato.

If you are in the neighborhood, or even if you are not, make your way on over to Sunset off Boulder and pop into the Klondike for some good food at Sarah's Kitchen. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been here for breakfast and dinner a few times now. Overall it's an okay place to have a meal. The food ranges from mediocre to almost good. The service is friendly, but amateurish. Basically, the main reason for dining here are for the food deals. They have some very good food values here.

So, it's a comfortable place to have a fairly cheap meal, but don't expect too much. It'll probably be okay."}
{"text":"I can not write a review on the food because I never got to try it.  I tried to be open minded because the reviews were mixed but I can confirm the service here is horrible. We were seated and after 10 mins of being ignored we gave up and left. I get places can be busy (though there were several open seats in the small restaurant) but you can at least acknowledge someone and let them know it will be just a minute."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. We did wait about 10 minutes for a table but that was because they were packed. I had the deuces breakfast, it came with 2 of the following, pancakes, bacon, sausage links and eggs for 2.99. How can you possibly go wrong with that? Great value, good food, nice and clean new restaurant."}
{"text":"So this is my second visit. I wanted to be sure before giving them a rave review. First time, I had the 16 0z t bone steak,I hate green beans so the waitress got me broccoli instead and it was delicious. 
This time it was late so I did the philly, well done. And I ate every bite... even the fries and I usually not a big fry person.  My wife got the breaks fast burrito for$2.99 and it was a big meal with hash browns and fixing- pics, sour cream and guacamole, which usually is extra at most places.  This is definitely going to have be my more often place. Both times we were seated right away and waitress were both very attentive.  This is a nice hidden gem.   
Both times the price was cheap considering fast food would have cost more.  A sit down meal for under$20, amazing place. Thank u so much \"sarah kitchen\""}
{"text":"one of the best breakfast values in the Vegas area. I ordered the steak (medium) and eggs (sunny side up) with hash browns and toast for $5.99. Eggs were cooked perfectly and the steak was tasty, seared nicely and not an ounce of gristle or fat. I stayed at the Sunset Station Casino Hotel and Sarah's is about 10 minute drive...well worth the time (much better than the \"Feast\" buffet garbage food)."}
{"text":"This place is a good deal. We've been twice and have had a good experience both times. The servers are attentive, our waitress even left the the pot of coffee for us to refill as we liked. The food comes quickly and tastes good. It is much more informal here than other casino restaurants, so its a laid back atmosphere, but a good place to get a good meal."}
{"text":"Loved it! Came in just in time for prime rib dinners for the amazing price of $5.55 - tasty and tender with plentiful au jus, veggie, and choice of potato. Nice house wine for $2.50. Breakfast burritos a steal! Everything was great!

A little confusion about getting the correct prices on the bill, but it was all sorted out with no problem. Friendly staff, very helpful."}
{"text":"I had the Prime Rib dinner for $5.99, which include a nice salad and it was a steal. Good food a a very reasonable price. The only issue we had was having to walk through smoke-filled casino to get to the restaurant. All 7 of us enjoyed our meals and found the prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm trying to understand why this place is always short staffed in the morning? Like come on you guys have that $1.49 special what do you expect? No traffic?  The food is good the wait just to get someone to take your order is soooo long."}
{"text":"What an awesome little secret place.  I just enjoyed a super yummy chorizo and egg burrito.  The prices are amazing too!! This is our new hang out spot"}
{"text":"Searched Yelp for breakfast and found this rating. Good clean restaurant inside a slot casino. Interior is nice , good decent priced food with specials. I ordered the ham eggs for 7.99, good price for a lot of food. Would've given a 5 star but it was smokey from the casino, but given it's a casino this the 4 star rating. This meal also comes with toast. We stayed at Hilton lake Las Vegas where they wanted $18 for continental breakfast! Drive 12 minutes from the hotel to this place for better food. Lake Las Vegas way over priced , thank you yelpers!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while waiting for my vehicle to get repairs near by. The food was delicious and the staff were fast and friendly. The decor is very modern while keeping the cafe feel. I highly recommend stopping if your hungry and in the area."}
{"text":"Service was slow although there were only 2-3 tables of customers. The casino is attached to the restaurant so if you like cigarette smoke with your food than you will love this place. If you are on a really tight budget and you enjoy crappy food and slow service than this is your kind of establishment. I'd suggest taking your hard earned money and spending it somewhere else."}
{"text":"Kathy made sure I was accommodated because they were out of what I originally planned to order.  Exceptional service. Delicious food. Will be back ASAP !"}
{"text":"We wouldn't let the 30 cent price increase deter us from ordering the breakfast special again this trip.  April, our server, was like a personable, energizer Bunny compared to our server last November.  She quickly arrived at our table, welcomed us, took our orders, and checked back frequently for coffee refills.  She also returned with more toast because the first order was not complete.  The breakfast special of 3 slices of bacon (sausage is an option we declined), sourdough toast, 2 easy over eggs and hash browns was as good as good could be.  We have not tried the prime rib that the Las Vegas Advisor touts as a top 10 value, but the breakfast special will keep us returning trip after trip."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant at the Klondike Casino in Henderson. It has some decent specials and their overall prices are very reasonable. Our food experience has been a very mixed bag here, though the service has always been friendly.

Their T-Bone Steak special is pretty good, but their country fried steak was awful. Their Jumbo sized hot dog is good, as is their breakfast burrito. We tried the street tacos and were shocked at how good they were, but the Cajun wings were some of the worst wings I've ever had. They had no Cajun flavor and even the server said most people don't like them. That pretty much sums up our experiences here with the food, it's hit or miss.

Honestly this place isn't bad, but its not good enough to make us regulars except for the discounts and comps we get from gambling in the casino. If you are going to the Casino to play and want to eat here, you probably wont be disappointed (depending on what you order). The only other reason to seek this place out is if you want a cheap T-Bone steak that shouldn't disappoint you."}
{"text":"It's probably exactly what a reasonable person would expect from a recently renovated, small 'locals' casino -- clean & modern 24/7 cafe with a basic menu, decent food & cheap to fair prices.

I ordered the onion rings as an appetizer, & the Meatballs & Spaghetti as the main course, however, as a vegetarian, I asked for just spaghetti marinara -- no meatballs!

First out was a small salad, which comes with the entree.  It was good.  Next out were the onion rings -- about 8-10 rings of various sizes, and Ranch dressing as a dipping sauce.   The onion rings were pretty greasy, as I suppose most are, so I'm not complaining, however I do expect a big stomach-ache from them at any moment -- hopefully I'll be home by then!   I do wish more places would get rid of (more of) the grease before serving onion rings, or set them down atop a diaper or something! 

The pasta course was good.  Instead of them bringing Parmesan cheese on the side, the entree came with it already atop the pasta -- fine for me, but beware, if you don't want cheese.   Also included with the pasta entree were two fresh garlic bread sticks -- they were very handy in absorbing the excess liquid in the bowl of pasta.

I was sad but not surprised to see that instead of deducting a dollar or two off the price of Meatballs & Spaghetti ($8.99) since I asked for pasta & sauce without the meatballs, I was charged full price.

My bottom line:  Decent food at an OK price & good, friendly service, but neither the casino (I don't gamble) nor the restaurant will be a 'destination' for me -- I came here because I was curious, my curiosity is now satisfied, and I don't see a reason to return.    But if you're a local looking for a small, clean & friendly place to gamble or hang out at the bar & watch a game on TV & while you're here already, you're hungry for some basic food, Sarah's Kitchen will meet your needs."}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to Sarah's Kitchen. I was getting my windows Tinted at Green Valley Window Tint when they suggested I might try this little place inside the Klondike Casino on Sunset road in Henderson. I walked over and got in line and had a seat at the counter. The place was busy with many blue collar workers and possible retirees. The menu is very simple and you can tell by how busy it was very non expensive. I had my usual CFS and eggs. Very tender meat and great thick sausage gravy. There was a taste to this gravy that was unique but could not put my finger on. It was too busy to ask but given the chance I will go again and ask. 
Service was quick and friendly 
Thank you for Dining at Sarah's Kitchen. I want to go here again with the wife and try a few more things on the menu. Loved the atmosphere and the prices. Check it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Just wanted to give a shout out to one of the best places to go for breakfast from 0700 to 1100 Mon - Sun.  Sarah's Kitchen is located at the Klondike on Sunset just before Boulder Highway.  They have an \"early bird\" special = 2 eggs (any style) hash browns, 3 pieces of bacon or sausage and toast = $1.49!  The place is always hopping and the service staff is extremely friendly and they pay attention to detail!  I would also like to give a personal shout out to Roger & Monica who regularly wait on us.  Roger doesn't even need to write down his orders....he quickly memorizes what each person wants and then he always returns extremely fast and jokingly says \"sorry for the long wait\".....when there was NO LONG WAIT AT ALL!  He has a quick wit and he takes great care of all his customers with amazing speed and accuracy!  I would recommend Sarah's Kitchen to anyone who enjoys a good quality breakfast at an unbelievably LOW price and a terrific service staff.  Cassidy, the cashier/host, is also always smiling and helping out in any way she can!  Go and see for yourself!  Tell them James Roth II sent you!   :-)"}
{"text":"Yesterday, long wait for breakfast (over 45 minutes to get the food from ordering).  The eggs were not exact, the pancakes had a bit of a hard skin (too much heat lamp, maybe).  Lunch today, less wait, but food was just \"OK\", not excellent.  The specials are very inexpensive and filling.  After being closed for years, the Klondike Casino on Sunset Ave has reopened.  Sarah's Kitchen is inside the casino.  I think the staff are still learning their jobs, and there are some personnel issues they need to sort out before this place could be considered decent.

Overall, the service is slow.  The food specials are a good value.  The food quality is passable.  I hope the front of house and back of house improve because this place is close to my house.  The bread served with the spaghetti and meatball lunch special was gummy.  The spaghetti was boiled too long (it gets big and too soft).  The sauce was good.  The meatballs were good.  The cheese was good.  Getting your drink refilled can be a bit difficult because the wait staff are still learning the basics (but they are friendly, so some things can be forgiven).  I've been here 2 times now, once for breakfast, and once for lunch and each time, order accuracy (forgetting to put drinks on the bill) and prompt service have been issues."}
{"text":"I had a chicken noodle soup and a soda on the side. The restaurant is brand new. Loved the new look."}
{"text":"This just opened a few weeks ago so we thought we'd give it a try. Very happy we did.  Very nice re-model of the previous casino/restaurant. Friendly staff, good service, generous portions, good prices. The first time we went I had the hamburger, my boyfriend had the fettuccini and my daughter had the salmon. All of them very good, especially the 1/2 lb burger. The second time we went, I had the prime rib special, my boyfriend had the open face pot roast sandwich, and my daughter had the club sandwich. Again, all of them very good. My only recommendations at this point are (1) use fresh cut fries instead of frozen, and (2) improve the garlic breadsticks on the appetizer menu, or lower their price."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they reopened! At first service was decent but it been on the decline slowly ever since ! Always running out of one thin or another today it was steak and spinach ! Now service is shabby at best sorry to say since I do support local businesses! This is how businesses fail ! You need to step it up because me personally today might be the last time I eat at this restaurant !"}
