{"text":"Ravi Soup opens a location in Parkdale West.   Much the same as the rest of the Ravi Soup family, and a good thing at that.   Predictably tasty soups and wraps at decent (if not altogether cheap) prices.   A welcome addition to a neighbourhood sorely lacking in soup options."}
{"text":"Couldn't get any better. If you don't go you will miss out. I had the Ravis stew and the Curry lamb wrap. Excellllllente meal! Wish I could eat that back home in Holland."}
{"text":"I was wondering how this soup place was so highly rated. It is just soup after all? But after eating here, I now understand. The soup here is a real meal, and it's delicious. The staff are very nice and seem to take pride in what they bring you. I wouldn't say it's a cheap place to eat - but once you dig into that big bowl you realize you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Had been going here quite often until I paid attention to how they were preparing my meals behind the counter. The guy that took my order punched it in on the register and then turned around and started making it with HIS BARE HANDS. Not even washing them before doing it. I watched in horror as he sprinkled spinach on my wrap then casually started opening cupboards and pulling out supplies from under the sink area, then continued sprinkling ingredients with his bare hands.   I threw it away on my way out and will not be returning ever again."}
{"text":"After trying the corn chowder soup I can't think of any better soup. It comes with blue crab in it and it just tastes delicious. Very filling. A must try!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It first intrigued me when my bf moved into the area... I hadn't tried it until my sister brought home a mushroom bisque from our local ravi soups location.   So yesterday I tried it.. the mushroom , wild rice bisque was superb. Perfectly spiced. It's $9.50 alone, but if you get a soup and wrap combo it's cheaper; $11.50. I opted for that and I was so happy.   The chicken wrap was very well balanced and incredibly tasty... unlike other places that have dry chicken. This chicken was moist and perfectly seasoned. It did have sweet potato in the wrap, which is something I am not too keen on... double starches.. but it wasn't half bad... I don't know what kind of flavour it had... I don't know if the proper name is a Masala or Curry but it was a wonderful dinner. And probably a wonderful meal any time of the day.  I am pleased that this place is in both my 'hoods. I look forward to trying their other menu options and their biscuits, which I hear are pretty tasty too.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great soup .... big portions  Would be nicer if they had calorie counts on the soups.   Price was $12 .... a little to much however that's just a personal thing for me"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just ate at here tonight for the first time. The person behind the counter was super helpful and gave us samples. The samples really helpful in making our order. I would recommend this place to my friends."}
