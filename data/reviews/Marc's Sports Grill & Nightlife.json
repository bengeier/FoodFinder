{"text":"If you arent an advocate of adversity and an open mind dont go! If your the typical baby gap tshirt wearing douchebag whos used to being the ever popular $30k millionaire in Scottsdale dont do it!  or the doated upon uptight bleach blonde female yuck face scottsdale patron then dont stop here either. This establishment is for the person who is interested in a diverse crowd of people and great (scratch that) best bar food! I have been coming to this bar since it was big D's and you have all walks of life here. There is the occassional jerk off who will ruin it for everyone but thats anywhere you go! Marc has done a spectacular job retaining original staff. They have all been there longer than you or I have probably held a job... 8+ years. They are all very respectful and personable... Props to first and formost \"the princess\" Trish, Mr. Ron, Steve, Kelli, and Rhonda You guys freakin Rock!!!! I dont know how you do it sometimes!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I always come here and we always have the best service!! All of the employees make you feel like family, especially Brandon! (He makes really great drinks Too! You're welcome :)) Great food for a bar!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment twice now on a Friday. Let me start by saying that if you are at all in any way shape or form prejudice or racist this is not the establishment for you!!! It is an extremely diverse crowd. So if you are close minded and ignorant go somewhere else. Secondly, the first time my boyfriend and I went we had a good time, but after last night I don't know if I'll be going back. I had a tab at the karaoke bar and I was extremely disappointed in the bar tenders service. He was rude, disrespectful and unaccommodating. The rotation for the karaoke was awful! I waited for quite some time before I was called the first time, and I saw others go multiple times before I was called again. I understand that it's a neighborhood bar and you can't hold it to the standards of a Scottsdale bar, but those types of places should be even more concerned with customer service and satisfaction, because they want to keep repeat customers, and then on top of that they charge a cover! I should have listened to my sister and friends and went to Hurricane Bay. No cover for ladies, & 50 cent drinks! Actually, I am kind of embarrassed I even brought my friends to this place :("}
{"text":"If you want to enter the ghetto version of hell on earth then come to this place!  IF you are into (or yourself) ghetto, ratchet, and classless then this is the place for you. If you are into at least a halfway decent crowd then avoid this place like AIDS! The visit to the restrooms will make you feel like you might catch AIDS just from contact with anything in them Nastiest restrooms I have ever seen & I accept the lower standards of bar and club restrooms usually!

This place is filled with hot messes, overweight nasty women dressing like they have the bodies of fit models in skirts way too short showing off their unfortunate meat \"packages\". I'm confident 70% of the patrons have criminal records and 25% have warrants for their arrest. I'm fairly certain that a few dudes were gone on something other than alcohol and/or even a little weed.

IF you want crazy men stepping up to you like they would easily snatch you up to rape you if you were alone then here's the place for you.  At times throughout the night I was uncomfortable with my own safety given the men walking around. Guess I'm not use to the ghetto...this place immediately gave me flashbacks of the gutters of Memphis, TN that I had to escape from.

The ONLY thing I could give this place is that the DJ played hot songs BUT unfortunately he had a thing for being stuck in the 80's as he scratched the songs way too much which at times disrupted the song and dancing altogether.  The women were messes except for a few and the men could've easily been mistaken for ex-cons or gangstas. 

I didn't try the food and one other thing, without any forewarning I had to find out that the place had a $15 minimum when using your card....outstanding! This place is definitely the conference hall for the ghetto, crazy, hood, and ex-cons!"}
{"text":"I went in tonight for a beer and to take some food home. I sat at the bar for literally around 5 minutes (it felt like 15) without being greeted. The bar tender (a white guy with a beard, wearing a hat backwards, and a bit of a beer belly) actually walked by, and noticed, me 3 times as well. After the second time I said to myself, \"okay, if he walks by again and doesn't at least say something like, \"hey man, I'll be with you in a minute,\" then I'm out.\" The third time he actually grabbed a glass from right in front of me, but said nothing. So I rolled out. That seemed like a very clear message that he wasn't interested in my business.

Maybe I'll go back, but a place that hires people that can't be dependable for very simple customer service makes me very weary. If the guy couldn't take 10 seconds to smile and say, \"be right with you\" can I really trust he's washing his hands after going to the restroom and then making people's drinks? It shows a general lack of concern/respect for the customer. Can't trust it. Especially not when it comes to food and drink."}
{"text":"So many haters writing reviews! This is definitely a bit of a dive bar, but it is one of the best dive bars I have ever been to. Free entry poker tournaments, pool, darts, karaoke in it's own room every night of the week... what's not to like!? Drinks were delicious, stiff, and reasonably priced, food was tasty bar food, and the bartender was funny and friendly. If you are expecting a fancy dance club, you will be disappointed... but then, it DOES have Sports Bar in the name. Great, friendly crowd, too! Overall, I had a great time and would encourage anyone to go enjoy a brew or two!"}
{"text":"Yummy big wings! They also are very good on keeping up with drinks And condiments such the extra napkins and plates for our wings when we had joiners to our table."}
{"text":"If I could give this bar no stars I would. First off let me start by saying this bar is not an average dive bar. It is a filthy disguising bar with poor service! DUCK TAPE DOES NOT FIX EVERYTHING! Starting on the outside before u even enter the concrete ash trays are duck taped and there is trash everywhere. Inside the bar the tables are not stable the chairs and stools all need replaced. The bathrooms are yet again duck taped to keep the toilet paper rolls from falling on the floor. You would be surprised what elbow grease (cleaning) and paint would do for the place to start off with. The only great bartender they have is Brandon. The food use to be great. It now sucks. I can go on forever but I believe the message is clear. Over priced and filthy bar with shitty service!"}
{"text":"G-H-E-T-T-O!!!! They charge $5 on Fridays but the DJ didn't start until after 11:30pm and only had a jukebox!!!....they refused to serve tap water and we were told \"the owner said we can only serve bottled water\"....three people ordered and none received silverware....an alcoholic drink took so long my friend forgot she ordered it.....they refused to provide a receipt and stated \"we don't give them out\"....the crowd looked ROUGH....this place is a mess for Friday nights."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place no stars. Card minimum of ten dollars that can't even move between the two bars in here. Also was not told there was any minimum when opening a tab."}
{"text":"Im sorry, I cant really say too much about the bar. It was, well, a bar. 

I felt the need to review the epic performance that took place this evening. Nathan put on a truly stunning karaoke display. His opening number was good if not great, Twist and Shout... complete with the Ferris Beuler treatment. It was clear at this point that Nathan had the show after the first set. After some discussion and careful planning it was set... Nathan was going to bust out the Big Dawg for the second set. Now this is the point in the show that an artist has to let everything hang out... To take chances and hope for the best. Its on... 

Trey Anastasio of Phish once said in an interview that there were 2 artists that he has seen that always had the audience completely locked in and focused on what was going on, on stage. These 2 artists were Frank Zappa and Jerry Garcia. Trey has obviously never seen Nathan Simpson perform Lets Get it On. Some like to call this the human magnet others just like to call this EPIC! After a miscue on the opening line, Nathan rebounded nicely and served up a gem. By mid Getting On, a stage that was occupied by Nathan was now occupied by 4 other people, 3 of which being female and one of which being fucking hot. By the time the last notes were played we all just sat in awe... Thanks Nathan."}
{"text":"Marc's can be one star or 5 depending on the night.  It is one of my go-to bars so I decided to give it the benefit of 4 stars. Don't get me wrong I love this place. How can you go wrong with Karaoke 7 days a week? There is also a seperate side for hip hop music and dancing. They have a stage so that you can have the full rockstar experience though most people don't use it so it is by no means necessary. 

Drinks are strong and cheap. The seats are comfortable and loungy. The singing....depends on the crowd. The crowd changes a lot night to night despite the high doses of regulars. This tends to really be the downside...some night you get the hard rock cut up metallica t shirt crowd. metallica is ok but not much of a karaoke choice...then again if you are into it all power to you.

The restoom on the Karaoke side is Ally McBealled, meaning unisex which is always a fun way to make friends. You can generally mix your crowd with another. Quite the social anamole. Based on friends reactions this place is not for everyone..but if it isn't you are uppity. ahem."}
{"text":"OMG I'm new to Phoenix I love this place so far i've been here about three times and each experience was awesome especially with their taco Tuesday night Friday nights I love it."}
{"text":"Marc's is a dive bar, keep that in mind. It ain't a Scottsdale club!! It does the job, Strong drinks but dirty glasses. Bartenders are cool."}
{"text":"A dive karaoke bar with all gangster rap hip hop background videos. LOUD!! All the time But if you like that maybe it's ok for you. I rather like a good mix of real music. It had a poor music selection for a kj place.  This place seems a little rougher then I like. The people were nice tho. We ordered nachos. What we got were chips from a bag and ground beef, imitation cheese etc. no wonder it was only 8. 

The bathroom was men and women's in one COMBINED! . No locks on the stall's. It was dirty and in disrepair. One of the stall doors wouldn't shut and one was falling off the hinges. It is spooky for ones wife to go it alone in there. 

Was slightly worried about my car parked in the nearly unlit parking lot. 

Sorry, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone I know"}
{"text":"Can be a really fun cool place with the exception of one bartender. I wish I knew her name because she is horrible.  Actually, it was home bar for about 8 of of us  but none want risk her being there so we will wait until she is gone before going back."}
{"text":"I've only been here on a Friday or Saturday night. It's far too clubby for my tastes on the west side of the bar. The east side(karaoke side) was fun, but very slow service. Every time I wanted a drinl, I had to wait in line, and then hope the bartender looks at me. I've never had their food. Not sure I would give it a try as the place is not very clean. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Invited to a friend's private party in the MarcTini lounge. First impression, small - but decent for less than 50-people. DJ? More like DJ/Bartender - not the worst. However do not request any specific programming on music or tv's - they apparently do not carry the \"public\" univision channel and have \"never heard of soccer\". Unfortunate. Will not return."}
{"text":"Effing hell. Ordered 10 wings last night and fries. Waited over 45 minutes for my food. Checked in multiple times with the waitress whom I had to locate like it was some kind of game of hide and seek (skinny tattoos). She kept saying it's coming. Mind you she solicited me for food. After 45 minutes (literally) I went to the bar and asked for the order to go. She said ok. Waited another 15 minutes nothing. I eventually just left. I'll never prepay for anything there.  Essentially Marc's stole money from me. If I'd drank and not paid for my food they'd arrest me. Calling owner today. Not about the money. Matter of principle."}
{"text":"I went there tonight to hear live music. I arrived at 6:50 and ended up leaving by 7:15. I never even saw a waitress. Even though the layout is identical to how I remember it when the space was the Native New Yorker it was kept very dark and had a well worn feel to it. What I heard of the music was top notch. Unfortunately, the sound was absorbed by the wall and the seating...lets just say it was all but impossible to see the band. Can't see the band, can't hear the band well, no service - Thats too many strikes for me. I left without spending a cent in the place. Shame. The band was impressive."}
{"text":"Yikes! We went last night and some drunk girl hit her car against a big truck and hit the truck in to another car. Then a guy was stabbed in the face in the parkng lot. Buyer beware! The plus side is, the bartender Ron, poured strong,original mixed drinks.  Update to a recent post by someone else, I was there when the police where in your parking lot after the man was stabbed. I was there when the ambulance took him away. I never said the was stabbed in your bar, just your parking lot. It was quite the scene and I felt bad for the guy."}
{"text":"For those that like Hip Hop and are not Black it's actually very inviting and not so clubby. This is a real hood club whilst remaining inviting to those that aren't black. The guys aren't overly aggressive and there are some ghetto fabulous women but really there are all sorts here.,"}
{"text":"Fumbling through the free Phoenix billiards magazine, I ran across an ad of 5 hot babes. I asked my friend, 'Which one would you WANK to?'....

I chose one as well and ran into her lovely presence at Marc's! 

She even offered me a job... do I have what it takes ?

The service was, of course, phenomenal. 

Happy upbeat atmosphere. Chipper patrons, positive conversations.

Me likey here.

Fancy chicas. Cheap beer."}
{"text":"Expensive drinks! We came on a Friday night and were charged a $5 dollar cover. Ordered 2 long islands and 2 mixed shots consisting of jameson and their draft cider, and the total came to $47! I was in shock but paid. Then I came to the DJ booth with a $5 and asked to request some music. The DJ was incredibly rude and refused to even acknowledge me visually and simply stated \"I don't play top 40\" I said can you play some dance? I got a slight head nod. For the record there was NOBODY dancing so he might want to rethink his approach. He played one dancy song and people came on the floor. After that he went back to his style and it cleared almost immediately."}
{"text":"Great service cheap drinks and a great atmosphere 
Great hang out and relax during the day and fun popping night club at night! Food is delicious especially their wings!! The monster nachos are also amazing! Its a giant pile of mouth watery goodness!"}
{"text":"Well last night was my friends bday and she had made reservations here. Normally I'm hesitant to go places that are new to me but was open to anything. We showed up around 11:30 and the police was outside and I don't mean like 2 cops I mean like maybe 3-4 cop cars and they were walking around checking on everyone. Apparently from what I understand he cops being there is a normal thing. We get inside they have a karaoke side and the other side is where the dance floor and pool tables are at. We went to the bar and it took forever but I could understand since there were a lot of people there. So we go to the karaoke side and sounded like everyone was having fun definitely a lot of talented singers in that bunch. The bartender was friendly he recommended a watermelon adios let me say it was delicious. I was a little thrown off by the unisex restroom on that side but I didn't care much restroom was pretty gross and can tell no one had checked on it yet. We went to go dance despite all the twerkers on site, we were able to dance and have a good time. The prices we're pretty good considering we only had alcohol. 5 dollars for a red bull and vodka and 7 dollars do a watermelon adios. The music was pretty good and you can tell the dj was having fun there."}
{"text":"Grilled hot wings are very good. Great service by Steve on Fridays and Saturdays!! He makes the best drinks"}
{"text":"OMG, they have food here? I had no idea... ... ... GROSS! Ha ha.... 

Okay- place is divided, bar/ghetto club vibe with hip hop and redneck karaoke room. It's a little fun when they have their jazz jam nights on Tuesdays- some talented musicians come out, but it feels more like a practice session than entertainment, but still fun none the less. Good energy- nice change from the ghetto fabness the area has been sportin' recently... ... maybe historically. I dunno."}
{"text":"Incredible wings that are always at a decent price, but even better on Saturdays when they are 35 cents each! You have to order in 10, 15, 25, 50 and 100 pcs. 
This place is very dive-y, but not overly localized meaning its a good crowd if you are doing with dive bars. The bartenders are down to earth, real people, and its a great place to just kick it.
BTW, they have free wifi, so you can be sure to catch me there sipping a 20oz brewski slapping away at my computer."}
{"text":"Me and the boyfriend decided to stop by this spot one night for some cheap drinks. This was my boyfriend's go to spot for a cheap drink when he lived in AZ. I already knew it was a dive bar when I pulled up so I'm not going to complain about the ambiance and restrooms... it's a dive bar! It was pretty low key the night we went so I ordered my Tokyo tea and asked the bartender for the gadget thing so we could play the trivia game that shows on the screen. I also ordered the honey hot wings which were surprisingly delicious!! On our way out we peeked in the karaoke room and it looked like people were having a ball! A good no frills spot for cheap drinks and wings!"}
{"text":"All I can say is if you go, DON'T RUN A TAB!!! I was charged an extra 30 dollars on my credit card, so I called to speak to a manager.  The owner called a few days later, I explained the situation, he said he needed to call me back and when he did he told me the bartender told him what I had and it all added up correctly.   I told him I did not have all of that and what I did have, the bartender told me he was giving me a certain price and he was charging me more than promised.  He said, well the bartender doesn't have the authority to change drink prices and as far as what I had, he would call me back (again).  I still have yet to hear from him."}
{"text":"Total dive bar with the best wings around! Although I think the dining room needs a makeover the food and service are excellent. Great prices and friendly staff keep me coming back for more."}
{"text":"Bad experience! Slow service! I order 25 wings for out. I was told 25 minutes, the wings would be ready.  I live literally around the corner. I came  in to pick up the wings the bartender was not in the bar at the time, finally after about 10 minutes she appears she grabs take beers won't make eye contact or even tell me it will be a minute. She just  ignored me. Then as I'm moving around the bar trying to get her attention I see her changing the channels and when she is behind me she says \"sorry guys the T.V. Is more important\". When she does eventually get the wings she sets them down on the counter and walks away to cash other patrons out . So at this point it's been about 20 minutes total I've been waiting....The worst part she never apologized for bad service. I won't be coming back. Plenty other places that want my business this isn't one of them!"}
{"text":"Me and a couple friends went to Marc's tonight to watch the Coyotes game and we had a great experience. The food was excellent, and the atmosphere was nice. The only negative thing I have to say is they were short staffed. Steve was the only person working, so he was a little slow to take our orders, but the food was well worth the wait. Steve was very pleasant and friendly....not to mention pretty hot!! All in all, I would definitely go there again and more than likely, I will."}
{"text":"Ok...so yeah is some of the clientele obnoxious, yeah sure...but the bartenders are FAB-U-LOUS! Lindsey and Ron are THE BEST IN TOWN and the drinks are cheap. Ask for the \"money shot\" lol"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years, and I can say allot of bad things, and yet allot of good things about Marc's. I find the food very good at times, and the beer icy cold. If you want to eat your weight in wings, then head over to Hooters where on Wed. all you can eat, but if you want the best tasting wings on the planet in my opinion, then go no further then Marc's. Like all other bar's they are down right pricy for no reason other then demand, so if your going to be taken, then this is the best pace to have it done. The bar staff for most of my time all have been friendly, except a few and is why I have stopped coming in as often as I did, but am starting to come back more. Actually I feel more disrespected from the owner, then the staff and is the reason I started going to Kimmyz Sports Bar where I am always feeling welcome when I walk in. Frankly it's like cheers, when you walk in, people know your name, your drink is being served to you by the time you hit the table, that is my standards for my dollars. For toughs who bitch about the standard of people who comes to marc's, I don't totally disagree, that is why I am their when it opens, do my damage then get the hell out of Dodge. The night people WOW their own breed."}
{"text":"Dirty as hell, smells like fryers and the rugs are sticky when you walk on them. 
Poor upkeep"}
{"text":"Worst place to visit in Glendale. Karaoke bar but no one is allowed to sing, only the \"house\" band that consists of the bar owner and  his drunk friends. Its nothing but old dudes, bikers, and burnouts. Their beer selection consists of coors, bud, bud light and some other beer i've never heard of before. My friends and I visited and the bar keeps were not friendly. We arrived earlier than our friends and I ordered a coke and a bottle of water. I was the DD for the evening. My drink was served in a dirty plastic cup that looked like it had been used. It was a platic party cup that had been washed. . The atmosphere and bar keeps were not welcoming, inviting or friendly. I cannot stress that enough. Instead of a bottled water like i had asked for, they gave me water out of a pitcher that was pulled out from under the bar. At this point my friend and I had decided this wasnt the place we wanted to spend our evening. 

This is where they got really rude. 

I asked to get our tab for the two waters and coke. The bar tenders both ignored me for 15min. Im embarrassed I stood there that long, the bar was literally empty. They saw me and kept shuffling papers, laughing, and kept coming over asking again what i had ordered. I felt so disrespected, I gave the bar keep my card and she told me it would be $8 for the soda and two luke warm pitcher waters.. I asked how it could be so expensive and she replied it was the\"bottle\" waters were $4 a piece. I explained we didnt have bottled waters. She scoffed at me and said it would only be $5 then for the coke. At this point i was bewildered by the math used in this bar. I refused to pay it and my card was run anyway. She literally ran my card w.o my consent. I refused to sign the paper and my card was charged 15$ I was so furious I stormed out. 
At this point, the bar keep yell out for the male bartender who must think he's Thor or something charged me telling me I had to pay. Luckily, the owner was near the door and calmed the situation. I explained I was unhappy with the service and the situation that occurred, he told me to beat sand. He said I was \"86ed\" and I laughed. I got in touch with my bank and let them know that my card was run w.o my consent."}
{"text":"Love Marc's right side. Doesn't matter which night of the week, I can always find somebody I know. Trish, bartender, is so sexy I want to take her home but she won't let me. Scooby Steve, another bartender, sing so well he might as well be a country singer himself. Most of the people is nice.
Not a huge fan of left side (hip hiop side) too dark for me. 

If you want to go to Marc's and enjoy, try to go with somebody who's been there before, or be ready to make new friends. Never pick a fight with regulars, or you'll have the whole bar against you.

\"I love this bar~\" comes to my mind... Who's song was it?"}
{"text":"There hot wings are awesome! !!food is great but the bathrooms. ..yuck...don't use the rest room it will want to make you run for the door!"}
{"text":"Marc's is okay. It's hit or miss. It's a dive bar but drinks are good and bartenders are cool and music is good. Check it out for yourself but if you're prissy or snobby, this probably won't be your spot."}
{"text":"Last night in an attempt to go forth and have a fun night with friends we visited this place...and now we never will again.

The music was loud enough that we could barely speak to each other and place looked divey, but we were going to try it anyway.
After going to the bathroom whose stall door looked like it was kicked in several times and barely hanging on. The awkward unisex bathroom has only two stalls and wasn't very clean. (Which indeed matched the rest of the place.) The bar chairs and tables looked like patio furniture that desperately needs replace. The karaoke books are cheap plastic slips in binders and also need replaced, as they look like they've had better days. 
The service was awful, it took forever to get some service, (I'm guessing this place is a go up to the bar and order) The bartender was rude and talked over us without listening much. 
The place was also dead, not including us there was about 8 people there.
This dive has definitely dove and we'll be spending our money where upkeep is more of priority."}
{"text":"There's a karaoke side and the other side is your standard bar with pool tables.  The food is ok, but I've had better bar food.  The staff is usually nice.  They also have poker nights which can be fun.  Sometimes the people who hang out there get a little dramatic.  The poker and karaoke crowds all know each other so they have their social issues sometimes."}
{"text":"Had a blast. Great music, good people. No problems with service others mentioned. Head over for a loud, fun time on Friday night."}
{"text":"This medium size hip-hop / karaoke bar used to be pretty fun when it was Big D's but over the last couple of years has deteriorated rapidly. 

I am not commenting on the karaoke side of the bar or the weekday traffic as those have always been decent. I do have a serious problem with how the hip-hop side of the bar draws in real riff raff. I have no problem with hip-hop but when someone gets shot in the parking lot at closing time I tend not to return.

The patrons on weekends are thuggish. The drinks come at an ok speed. The main side of the bar (hip-hop side) is often a bit over crowded. This bar has no business charging a cover fee it is not even close to nice enough for that."}
{"text":"A two-in-one dive bar: One side for dancing, and the other for karaoke. The dance floor is pretty big, and I like the giant Captain Morgan statue in the corner. I wanna pose with it!

In any case, the prices are reasonable, except for all beers costing the same. Explain to me why a 24 oz. mug of Blue Moon and PBR cost the same. Go figure.

In any case, it apparently turns into some sort of Hip Hop club on Fridays. The bartender warned me that's not a fun night to go, so I'll probably stick to this place during week nights. I'll be back to tell you about the appetizers!"}
{"text":"I have been here before, its a bar!  But last night my husband our friends decided to go here have some drinks and a bite to ear.  Our Waitress was NEW! We ordered our drinks and the place wasnt overly full at 9pm.  20 minutes later, our drinks arrived.  We ordered our food.  Nothing special, me Garlic Fries, my husband a small taco salad, our friends a Calzone.  Food was coming out of the kitchen, and I saw my fries at the pass, my husbands Taco Salad also there.  And that is also where they sat for another 40 minutes, until the Calzone was ready. In all it took 75 minutes to get our food.  Needless to say I didnt eat the STONE COLD Garlic Fries.  Also when it came time to get another drink, our waitress was NO WHERE TO BE FOUND.  We had to go to the bar to get out drinks, only to be told, we had to go back to our table and for our waitress to take our order again, that would be fine if we could fnd her.  We decided to move from the Bar area, to the Karaoke side.  Our waitress informed us we would have close our tab, and didnt serve that side.  At that point, that was fine with me.    The waitress had too many stations for someone who was new to handle.  There was a big party there, and they were taking all her time, so she should have given our table to someone else.   Ive been there before, and it wasnt like that at all, but if this is what its like from now on, I wont be going back again."}
{"text":"Went here for someone's birthday tonight . Paid $14 for 2 beers at the bar.  Later on Paid Only $11.25 for 3 beers where kareokee was in the bar!!!!!!!!!! If you're a female DO NOT go here. The male friend I was with only paid $11.75 for 3 beers buT yet I was charged $17.50 for 3!!!!!!! The bartenders overcharge female customers."}
{"text":"It's a popular place but very different from the old marks at this location.  I think I'd have to already be drunk to want to come back here."}
{"text":"This place is a decent dive bar with a split personality. I went to meet a dozen friends from grad school last Monday, and we pretty much owned the karaoke stage. The bar, though, was split between a small karaoke room and a more divey themed room next door. The place looks like it was originally a karaoke bar that expanded. We'd definitely return."}
{"text":"First time at this bar and was not too keen on the atmosphere for a Friday night.  The music that was being played was not my favorite and outside of one particular awesome bartender, the rest of the staff was not inviting.  Would not recommend and most likely will not choose to return."}
