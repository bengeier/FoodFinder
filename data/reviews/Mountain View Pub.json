{"text":"Noticed the pub had a sign out for breakfast so we were excited to go try it. Thank goodness that we met some great friends otherwise the 75 minutes that we were there, would have been excruciating. I finally flagged down wait staff for a menu after sitting there for 15 minutes or more. Once drinks arrived, we were actually getting our own coffee refills. When the food arrived it was cold and the delivery disorganized. We wanted to leave long before the food arrived but felt trapped as the order had already been placed. Food arrived over an hour after we initially sat down when one of our party went and asked about the food. We watched 4 tables empty prior to getting food or drink due to lack of attention from the wait staff. The receipt was long and only noted meat and eggs so there was no way to determine that what we ordered VS what was delivered had been properly charged. At that point, we just paid the bill in order to gain freedom."}
{"text":"Really hope the owner can find good help.  I live in the area and have been her 4 times. They service Is not good. First time there we left after waiting 15 minutes with no service. Second trip the bartender was really complacent and rude. Third trip was great. Had a really good time. Met Ben from KNIX here.  Fourth trip which is today. Understaffed!!  Bartender keeps forgetting orders, doesn't remember what you ordered.  I keep seeing people come in and leave after sitting and no one noticing there are there.  People keep getting their orders to go as they are tired of waiting. The place is really nice. Really like the view and the location. Building was nice and had a great selection of beer.  Music is good.  Please add staff staff staff. It's a good place to be if you could get service."}
{"text":"We came here with high hopes but it was not to be.  We had just hiked spur cross ranch and had a blast.  Heard the view was great and decided to skip the buffalo chip and head over.   Great view yes but the service was so bad.   The waitress was indifferent and really did not come around after spilling one of our beers on the table btw.   We had the BLT and club sandwich which was just ok.  Better places in cave creek exist."}
{"text":"I love visiting cavecreek/carfree and was pleased to hear that there was a new restaurant to try. I decided to give it a try. I ordered a few pints of beer and a veggie platter. I was there just to have a few drinks with friends... 2 drinks down 35 mins later... no chips& salsa ( they apparently were out) no veggie platter came...They are being hand made I was told..... I asked for the check and left. I'm disappointed by the first impression that was made. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Saw this place and thought it had great potential and was excited to try something new. Such a great view but that's were it stops. Horrible service and no drink menu. Ordered a martini and it was 18.00. With no menu I had no idea its would cost that much and it was terrible. When we asked the bartender why it was so expensive his explanation was he charged for a double shot of vodka?? In a small community word of mouth and great referrals make all of the difference for new business. They don't have a website and seems like they are slow to get it together as they have been opened for 3 months.   The view was amazing."}
{"text":"Food was good, views are awesome!  This is a cowboy town so except the country music!   Wait staff is a little slow BUT it is a new place. We will be back!"}
{"text":"1st time here after just moving into area. I'm Scottish and they have Shepherds Pie and Kilkenny's.. Whats not to like!!  Great views, live music ... sure, menu is limited but it's predominantly a Bar and food is good.    Served by Franco today, nice guy, informative and friendly..  Will definitely be back... maybe on a Friday or Saturday to see what the crowd is like.   To be continued......"}
{"text":"We drove to town to furniture shop and decided to try an Irish pub for a black and tan. Beautiful view and as others have said...that's where it stops. Over 10 min to get our beer after we ordered and it was not busy at all.  We ordered pub cheese and crackers. Save the money. It was cheese whiz with horseradish. Gross. Then another 15 mins from the time our drinks were empty before I had to flag down another server to get our check. We wanted another round but didn't want to wait another hour. This place has TONS of potential. Hopefully the owners read these and make some changes."}
{"text":"Typical twangy country music. The only thing Irish is they sell Guinness. Sewer smell was nauseating"}
{"text":"Great place was having a good afternoon until I watched the bartender put her hand in a dogs mouth that was running around inside and then made my Bloody Mary without washing her hands.  Then the server was playing with the dogs toy and serving food at the same time.  Disgusting! Dogs in restaurants isn't right."}
{"text":"We treated friends who are new to the area to the Mountain View Pub tonight.  I explained the views are spectacular but the menu was limited.  I told them I've had the fish & chips but the fish tends to be dry.   The service has never been speedy but tonight was the worst!  I could go on and on, but I don't believe our server has ever worked in the food service industry. When our food finally came out, my fish was burnt.  Our guest is a former chef and said they are probably pre-frying and then reheating before they send the fish out.  I am so embarrassed and apologized for my choice to bring them there.  As always, the sunset was beautiful and we saw javelinas in the wash below and enjoyed our conversation in the hour and a half that it took to get our meals.  I will go back to Mountain View Pub, but I'll be sure to eat elsewhere first."}
{"text":"Excited to try this place great view, horrible food mediocre service and warm beer.  One and done we will not be going back here."}
{"text":"This was are first visiting your Restaurants when we walked in there was a group of employees just setting there with the owner Bs, we sat down looking for a server, few minutes went by a old lady came to are table and said that there is no servers to take are order so if we want anything we need to go to the bar, what restaurants don't have servers on? there was a gentleman cleaning tables he came over to tell us what was good on the menu, he went and got the bartender to take are order she was very nice, the food was great the fish and chip was very good, The gentleman name was Joe if it wasn't for him we would of left, be he went above and beyond great customer service, great expensive, we will be back. the views from the patio are great"}
{"text":"If your looking for a cold beer and a view- this is the place.  But service is slow and the food is below average."}
{"text":"Not a place to get a good meal.  Fish and chips was probably the worst I ever had.  View is great but that's about it.  Staff is pretty inexperienced."}
{"text":"We waited a few weeks after opening so they could get their act together.  Husband and I went in Sat afternoon, it was busy but not overly with lots of open seating.  We ordered a beer, wine and the cheese and cracker plate.  After waiting a long length of time for our drinks, they finally came without the cheese and crackers.  We waited again a long length of time, almost finished our drinks when the waitress stopped by.  We told her to cancel the cheese and crackers, that we weren't happy about the wait and please bring our check.  No check came, so we went to the bar tender, paid our bill and left.  When leaving, saw the cheese and cracker plate finally coming to the table.  We were there almost an hour.  We won't be back.  If you don't know how to organize and run a restaurant, please don't try.  Too bad, it could be a fun little place but one draw back is the parking is terrible."}
{"text":"Very disappointed again. In from out of town and wanted to watch a game on one of their many televisions. Once again they would not change a game to ESPN2.   Do they know that over 1/2 of their customers this time of the year are from other states and might want to watch their local team play??  Make the effort and try to accommodate your customers.  We left and went to Liberty Station in Terra Vita Marketplace on the corner of Carefree Highway and Scottsdale Road. Awesome place, awesome food and they will change the televisions for you!"}
{"text":"Beautiful views, and that's about it.   Too loud, hard to get service, owners are always drinking at the bar? Drinks are awesome, and I think they are trying. So that's awesome. We keep going, just don't eat there. And have don't be in a rush."}
{"text":"Early Saturday lunchtime with only ten others in the place, and we weren't greeted or given a menu, despite sitting at the bar. Eventually we got drinks and ordered \"food\" (wings, salsa and chips) which, when it was slung in front of us, was decidedly uninspired. Having lived in Ireland, that menu is NOT  Irish. No napkins, no silverware, no glass of water, no inquiry as to its taste, no recognition of two empty beer glasses that could have signalled a possible refill. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This place will never learn....we have stopped in every once in a while just to see if their service has improved any. Not the case, it has only gotten worse!!! On top of that they keep raising the price of everything. You ask for the house wine and half the time they are out or they have one on TAP!!!  WINE ON TAP? It might as well be out of a box!  When they opened you got french fries now you get potato chips. Then they changed it to charging you  $1.00 extra if you wanted french fries, then a couple weeks later they raised it to $2.00 and now it has been raised to $3.00 and the price of their food keeps going up at the same rate with no improvement in quality. The chicken sandwich has gotten sloppy and difficult to eat (that was about a month and a half ago, the second and last time I attempted to eat one) Their food is not very good and their service has only gotten worse.  I don't think they are reading these reviews!!!!!!!  They should not be in the restaurant business!!!!"}
{"text":"Think again! The view is awesome but service was very slow.  We ordered a Reuben with fires and a Patty melt.  They were the greasiness sandwiches.  The corned beef was tough.  They forgot our fries so they brought our aa very small portion of cheap fries.  We will not eat there again! Had the worst stomach ache last night!"}
{"text":"Don't want to criticize the food as we didn't eat there. And the view is amazing. But, apparently the only music you can play on the jukebox is really old country and honey tonk. I played Thomas Rhett's \"Vacation\"  and the bartender skipped it; I played Meghan Trainors \"Future Husband\" and the bartender skipped it. I would understand if I played some heavy bass rap stuff but this was upbeat music with a beat. Guess they're telling me they only want Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard lovers for customers."}
{"text":"Visited the MVP in January with a group of us after golfing.  The food was great (recommend the Shepard's pie), but the people working there were amazing.  Our waitress (Julia) was a blast, bartender (Regina) kept us mostly in line, and the owners (Michelle and JP) were the best.  Live music was fun, and the crowd was super into it.  Can't remember when we had a better time.  Would highly recommend if you like fun."}
{"text":"Excited to finally come. Live Jazz band, great crowd. Gound our own table on tge patio. Never acknowledged by any of the servers that walked by us. Waited 15 minutes. Got up and spoke to another server about our table and still no one showed up. Tables on either side of us acknowledged and served. Walked out and will never return. Such high hopes."}
{"text":"Just tried this place and it was pretty good.  The place is small and quaint with beautiful views.   It has a small menu yes, but the choices were good.  The day I went the quality of the food was great.  Cute place but tight inside with limited seating.  Nice stage area for a band."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying great location an DC decor. First time in my hubby and I sat at the bar did not get greated for 10 minutes finally a beer after 13 minutes.  Sat with empty drinks for 10 minutes no can I get you another.  We asked for our check cashed out and went to another bar."}
{"text":"Nice view, nice space.  Plenty of work to do with the menu/food.  Would give them some time to get their feet on the ground before coming back....."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to our little town. We've been here for drinks before, but today is the first we tried the food. Always burgers first for me. If the get the burger right, the rest follows. Well,  the burger is great. Good flavor, fresh bun and condiments. Can't wait for summer to be over and garage doors open up!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  I was really hoping for a decent experience here. Nice setting but the service, er I mean the complete and total lack of service made it a terrible 1st experience. The waitress did not wait on us for over 5 minutes. It then took over 10 minutes to get our beers. Really?  Plus she was borderline surly. We were going to order dinner anyway, but then she didn't come back again. When she finally reappeared, we just paid our tab and split. I'll wait till it goes under and is hopefully replaced by something better..."}
{"text":"The cheese board was awesome! The grilled ham and cheese was monsterous! Fantastic place! Best bar in Cave Creek!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best burger in town hands down... keep up the great work your doing.. looking forward to the rest of the menu.... Entertainment was top notch!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great view and great band but service stinks! Order 3 beers at a time."}
{"text":"This place really surprised us. We stop by on a beautiful sunny afternoon to give it a try. Food was very good and the beer selection was fantastic. Outdoor sitting on the patio has a beautiful view. And the music in the background was great. All in all we thought we were in for a great afternoon. Then the band started. Whiskey and the barrels. I'm not sure if the idea was to purposely drive all their customers out or if they just were willing to give the worst band in the Phoenix area a try. Now I'm sure there is a place for a punk rock Celtic band or I should've said a foul mouth punk rock Celtic band. And maybe this is the place for them. But if it is it's not for me. I try to think of myself as someone who enjoys lots of types of music. But this was not only loud and obscene - it was just plain bad. It's spoiled what would've been a very pleasant afternoon of good food and good Guinness. Hopefully management figured it out when everybody got up and walked out but if they didn't it'll be a long time before we go back. They deserve a four star rating before the band and no stars after they let that band play."}
{"text":"Wow, that was awful. The fish and chips special was disgusting, greasy crap. Fish was just plain terrible as well as the greasy breading. Same with the chips, greasy potato chips gone wrong. Comes with malt vinegar in a plastic cup. Terrible brand or something, tastes bad. Cmon man! Put the good bottles of malt vinegar in the tables! The shepherd's pie was just as bad. Comes in a pasty and it shouldn't.  Basically mashed potatoes in a broken up pie shell, seriously. Too bad, one of the employees said it was someone's grandmothers recipe. I'm sure hers is five billion times better. Two stars because the drinks were good, the view was good and the staff is nice."}
{"text":"Great Irish pub! Atmosphere is inviting, great pint of Guiness, pub burger is excellent and great value and the mountain views are amazing, music on the weekends!"}
{"text":"This place is kinda a nightmare...great views and awesome potential...but, hillbilly waitstaff and patrons ...the guy next to me was smoking (on outdoor deck..which is non-smoking btw)...had to ask the waitress to tell him to put out (like she didn't notice?) ...food on the low-end scale of marginal bar food...they have some food service ketchup that is absolutely horrible...limited parking...this place could kill it with the location, was excited to go when it first opened, but will likely not return unless grabbing a brew at the bar...and maybe bring my own pretzels."}
{"text":"Alright food, pretty small lunch menu, and poor service. For lunch on a Monday there was only one waitress to a pretty sizeable crowd. The menu doesn't identify that fries are extra and the amount they give is adequate. Would not go here again."}
{"text":"Nice views, terrible parking, Drunk owner.  Not going back"}
{"text":"Awesome view, nothing like it in Cave Creek. We love the bands and variety of music. Food is good pub food."}
{"text":"Great wings, good music, nice environment. But it takes 45 minutes to get this. Slowest service in cave creek. I would love a shot of whiskey, hold on 30 minutes and we will get that right to you. Sometimes your shot will come in a shot glass, sometimes in a high ball. Who knows why it changes? Don't come here, just continue down the road to a good bar/restaurant."}
{"text":"I have ordered food Togo from here a couple of times and I enjoyed both the cheese burger I ordered and the pub club sandwich."}
{"text":"We went during lunch time on a Saturday.  Our waitress was nice but way overwhelmed which was reflected in our service or lack thereof.  We only saw one other wait staff so between the two of them they couldn't keep up.  Very limited menu items and the food was just average at best.  We probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"I can never understand why someone could pour buckets of money into opening a restaurant and then not go the extra mile to make it live up to its potential. Alas, that is what has happened here. The best part of this place is the patio and its panoramic mountain view. When the sun is beating down on you and its 95 degrees out, though, you need a little relief and there was no sun shade in sight and very few shady seating options, unless one wants to sit inside and be blasted by a live band. Great if you're there to listen to music but not if you want to catchup with friends. That was only the beginning of a litany of sins. As other reviewers have pointed out, no drink menu, so you have no idea what your drink is costing you. The waitress had a few wines and beers on her own personal \"cheat sheet,\" but no prices or any idea where the wines came from. The menu is small and uninspiring. Two of us had fish and chips, which consisted of one piece of fish that was so dry I could barely swallow it and some homemade potato chips. My husband ordered a patty melt that oozed so much blood that he was afraid to eat it and sent it back to be redone. Needless to say, none of us felt as though we'd eaten dinner by the time we forked over $100 and were out the door. I really Wanted to like this place but it's not happening. I would rather cook and look at the mountain from my own backyard."}
{"text":"I hoping for a better experience then what I've been reading from online reviews and from my Nextdoor app.  But unfortunately it wasn't anything special.  The view is great but the food not so much.  My husband had the patty melt and could only get half down from being overcooked.  I had the peel and eat shrimp and they were mushy leading me to believe they were boiled to long.  Oh well, like I said the view was great."}
{"text":"After giving this place a couple of tries we went for the last time. The absolute worst service in the Creek. We will never go back. Unfortunate, because the view is very pretty."}
{"text":"Beautiful views but that's it.  Terrible service. We walked out after waiting 15 minutes for a server.  Bartender was busy counting out her drawer instead of taking orders. Too bad. 1st and last time here."}
{"text":"Good food, but a really bad bartender. Do not get the bling with glasses. She made my drink wrong as well as others and the. Would not serve us, but had time to talk to others."}
{"text":"Great beers and views from the Mountain View Pub in Cave Creek. Second time eating lunch here and once again happy with food and service. Food menu is limited but hearty enough to go with the beers. Will definitely come back here on a weekend night to see live bands and hang with friends!"}
{"text":"We went there to get a bite to eat our first night in Cave Creek.  Not much on the menu yet but I assume it's because they're so new.  We all had burgers and fries.  The burgers were a good size and very tasty.  We also had some pickled shrimp which was different but very  good also. They didn't have a sweet red wine for my wife but they were confident that they would have it soon.  We went on a Thursday night and there was live music.  Aside from the short food menu and incomplete wine selection, the Mountain View Bar was aptly name as it had a wonderful view of the mountains!  We were fortunate to meet the owner who was very friendly.  He even brought over a portable heater to help warm us up and lit it with a propane torch!  He informed us that they were to install some permanent ones soon.  He also said that they were going to build a new seating level below where we were sitting.  There also would be an area below that to tie up your horse should that be your mode of transport!  Right now I would recommend this place to go get a drink and enjoy the view.  Hopefully they will develop a bigger menu because we did have was good."}
{"text":"Second time here. 20 years+ in Cave Creek. Loud loud live band and I could not even talk to my partner at the bar. Bar waitress totally indifferent, as she spoke most of the time to her 'boyfriend sitting next to me'. Food ok. Noise level: NOT acceptable. SERVICE: Indifferent. TIP:$0."}
{"text":"I read some not so good reviews about this place.. Was willing to give it a try and so sorry we did. Will never go back, overpriced food, and what food we got was absolutely the worst I've had!!! Yuk, save your money, no Happy Hour, was told they adjusted their prices so they didn't need to have Happy Hour, the farthest thing from and Irish Pub we've EVER been too. Aweful, Aweful!!!!"}
{"text":"Lame pop country music and Fox News on all 3 TVs... average bar food at best... this place is for fake people... enjoy"}
{"text":"It's obvious that it's a soft opening due to the limited menu and overwhelmed wait staff. The atmosphere and this place has potential but they need to get squared away and increase their menu. I'll give it another try in a month or so."}
{"text":"Fun Place! Beautiful view of the Cave Creek Mountain area, along with perfect outdoor seating. The food is good, drinks are great and the atmosphere is perfect. Don't be in a hurry, the service is a little slow. (If you know that going in, you won't be upset when you find out.)  But outside of that, it's a great place to be! They also have live entertainment with some local hot talent! One of Our Favorite Places!"}
{"text":"The view was outstanding but food was terrible. Wished we saw the reviews before stopping. Won't make that mistake again."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time on a Friday night. Live music was great!! (I believe the band was called Kilted Spirit....they were awesome!). Menu is limited but our food was really good...had the Fish and Chips (literally chips, not fries. You can upgrade to fries) and the Shepard's Pie (which comes in a sort of calzone form).   Service was efficient....views were stunning.  Looking forward to coming back when it's cooler and enjoying the patio, too.  Cool place..."}
{"text":"Met some great friends here for dinner.  View was amazing.  Absolutely wonderful.   BUT...... took 20 minutes to get our drinks, when the waitress finally came back to take our order- it had now been 30 min.   Three of us ordered fish and chips.    25 min to get our food .   You get ONE piece of fish no bigger than what you'd get frozen in the store--and it was 12 bucks and terrible.   So dried out I couldn't eat half of it.   I was so thankful we had wonderful fellowship and saw Javelina wandering below.   I won't be back but pray that the owners read all the complaints because they all mention bad food and terrible service.   Total time for dinner---  2 hours. ON A TUESDAY   Not busy.   How sad."}
{"text":"Nachos were huge and delish, were new to the area and love Irish Pubs and live music. My husband got the combo platter and LOVED it. By the way it was huge. We sat at the bar with a friend and our service was great PJ is a superb bartender and dealt with obnoxious questions and drink orders. They are even Guinness certified!!! Great place we will be back!!! They also have an Arizona Lottery Pull tab machine we won $10 WOOT!"}
{"text":"Came back here after skipping it since our first visit during their opening a long while ago because it was awful. It always looks busy so figured it was worth a shot. Wrong. We came for drinks and to watch the killer storm since the pub does have fantastic views. My boyfriend ordered a vodka tonic with lime. This resulted in two confused questions at the time of ordering and then coming back to ask yet another question.  And I don't mean like asking for vodka preference. Pure confusion. You'd think he ordered some complex spirt. Vodka tonic. How hard is that to get right? My red wine tasted like it had been stored open in a hot sauna for a month. Gross. Several ice cubes melted right away and then it tasted old, just gross. We didn't finish our drinks and regretted not going to the Indigo Crow per the norm. Really hope they can get it together, so much potential with those views."}
{"text":"We love Irish pubs, spend a lot of time with friends and family frequenting them in all different cities. Most of our friends and family are of Irish heritage. So, when we moved here we needed to find the nearest and best Irish Pub. Where else would we take our friends. So my husband and I stopped in for lunch to try it out.  It was completely empty and completely silent, yet it took the waitress/bartender 15 minutes to come to our table. There was a short menu with only one Irish item on it, Shepard's pie. My husband ordered it because, one he loves it, second we are trying an Irish pub. After a few more minutes she comes back and tells us she doesn't have the ingredients for Shepard's Pie. He ended up with a boring, badly cooked, unseasoned burger. I got the Reuben which had hacked up corned beef it was both sliced and chopped so the texture was unpleasant, and the entire sandwich was salty and soggy.  For a bar it didn't have a drink menu with any signature drinks, the bartender had no suggestions, I ended up just getting ice tea, I believe it's the first time ever I ordered a non-alcoholic drink in an Irish Pub.  I won't be returning and I am still on the hunt for an Irish Pub to frequent. Adding Irish flags, shamrocks and Guinness posters doesn't make you an Irish Pub."}
{"text":"We had horrible service here on Friday 3/2. Our server was distracted, bored and inattentive. The kitchen burned my cheeseburger, and I was brought s new burger without cheese. When our server finally checked on us and I mentioned cheese she demanded to know what kind of cheese I had asked for. Ugh. The club sandwich and BLT were served on untoasted white bread that was completely dried out. When leaving we spied our busty bartender getting high in a truck right out front. I will go for drinks and the view, but skip food and avoid the server and watch the bartender."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. Great addition to Carefree / Cave Creek! ND Fighting Irish bar and AZ Cardinals bar.  Check it out. Food is great."}
{"text":"First time here on a Friday night but with a band playing Stevie Ray Vaughan covers, I got the last seat at the bar. I like the layout with the bar and the outside patio facing the mountains to the north.  It has an Irish theme so a lot of Guinness products and Irish whiskey options. I did not try the food, but good place to wet the whistle."}
{"text":"Menu small, great live music on Thursdays I know as a definite! Friendly staff, everyone has hiccups at the beginning.  I'm excited to see a taste of Irish, a little reminder of the Midwest in the heart of Cave Creek"}
{"text":"The view and the atmosphere is AMAZING! Service is meh and food and drinks suck @$$. I had so much hope. People smoking under the \"No Smoking\" sign. I'd love to come back and sit on the patio but I ain't spending a SINGLE DIME at this place again."}
{"text":"Our friends live in the area and waited for us to visit before trying this place. Nice of them, but as it turned out, not a great choice...  The wait for our drink order to be taken was a bit long. No biggie. However, our server took off as we tried to order food. The soda and so-called \"orange juice\" (tasted like friggin' generic Tang) came out quickly, but 15 minutes later, still no Bloody Marys and no food order taken.   We did observe staff quaffing drinks and not making ours, so we paid for what we got and baled out.   Seems unlikely that this place is going to make it. #sorrynotsorry"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, bar food, awesome view, music, a great place to hang out with friends...."}
{"text":"Decent pub food, many beers on tap, excellent views from patio.  Old school rock-n-roll background music. Didn't experience any of the service issues encountered by others. In fact, our service was fine. BBQ available on weekends."}
{"text":"The grilled chicken strips are a rip off. $8 for a few bites of chicken. The fries also had a sour taste like pickle. A good view."}
{"text":"The outside patio view is gorgeous....especially during sunset. Came to MVP after driving around Cave Creek sightseeing.  The service was extremely slow and when asked about their beers on tap our waitress did not know the beer menu.  Our waitress was very nice just a little slow, since the service was slow we decided not to eat here.  I would come back for the view...it's beautiful."}
{"text":"Beautiful view for sure, and a comfortable restaurant. The food is decent for a bar, but the service is really slow. We sat for about 15 minutes watching the waitress waking past us over and over. She only stopped when we stopped her. She looked a little surprised but agreed to take our order. We could have also had a better table but all the open ones still had the mess from the previous customers. The place has? a lot of potential but they need to get their act together. Oh, and the music is too loud. I love the music but we could hardly talk at our table."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to enjoy the beautiful views we heard about in other reviews, it was our first time going there last night.  Hunter, are waitress, was very prompt and pleasant! The bottle beer was ice cold too!  Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Good food and great service.  The view from the patio is lovely.  Breakfast is great.  The build your own Bloody Mary is the best.  We also love the fish and chips."}
{"text":"Love the location-probably the best view in Cave Creek. Nice beer selection-could be better-and friendly staff.  Why two stars then?  Their food is horrible-with hardly 10 items on the menu.  If they could get someone in there that knew the food aspect of a good bar people would be lined out the door.  I really would like to see this place make it...but as it stands????"}
{"text":"Another great view; however, menu and wait staff have issues. Heard great things about the burger so I ordered it medium and came out rare. Small printed table top menu says cheese and bacon $1 extra and comes with chips. Waitress asks if we want chips or fries. We said fries (thinking it's a $0 substitution). The $8 burger was billed at $13. We expected $10. When pointed out to waitress, she says it says right on the menu that we charge $1.50 for the c/b and $2 extra for fries. We all looked. Not there. She resists on the cheese bacon cost difference. She returns with updated check with only one of the $2 fries removed. No adjustment for cheese/bacon and 2nd fries. I fiddled with the piece of paper (menu) in plastic and discover the mention of $2.00 for fries which you couldn't see in the holder. Glanced at other tables near us and it was the same. Issue is not $1 or $3. It's the lack of attention to the menu and offering alternatives that cost extra with no mention of it and then resisting our comments. Menu has maybe 10 items, so wait staff should KNOW it. I might go back for a beer and the view. Not the food. We ended up overpaying by $3 but decided to just leave and not say more. It's a shame because concept is great."}
{"text":"Easily the best Irish Pub in the valley, the bar is perfectly designed with plenty of seating and a huge bar. He outside area has the perfect view. One of my he only bars carrying Killkenny Cream Stout, delicious beer. The service is very uneven and the food is just good, but the place is so nice it overcomes the minor shortfalls. The place to go to watch sports since the televisions are huge. Great place."}
{"text":"I am really wondering where this place finds their help.....again my husband and I came in to have a drink and sat down at the bar counter next to another couple.  The bartender ( a short haired brunette) walked by us to bring the other couple their water and then walked around the center island and came back around to bring them a menu. By this time she has walked by us twice. The bar counter was almost empty except for my husband and I, the couple next to us and a couple at the other end of the bar. After giving the couple next to us their menu she continued to walk to the other end of the bar and readied the dishes to put them into the dishwasher....never once acknowledging we were there!!!!! Does this women pick and choose the customers for this business??? You would think the owners would  not be happy when their employees are sending customers out the door because they decide who they want to serve and who they do not.  This is loosing the owners money.  This place rarely has a full parking lot as it is after 1 year. They have a BIG problem with their choice of employees. Maybe they should employ MEN and they might not turn away so many customers as the women they employ have way too much attitude!"}
{"text":"We just walked out of there after learning they had only ONE person servicing the whole \"pub\" including food orders. There were around 50 patrons there when we walked in. Service was already poor to start with. My prediction: won't last another year with this business model, slow service, and sloth like kitchen times.   Owners obviously not committed to service."}
{"text":"One thing it has is a view of the mountain everything else is a disaster The worst service I've had in my life"}
{"text":"We decided after passing by for months to stop. Nice, open feel, had beers, $6 each. Owner introduced himself, nice guy! Not even good tasting drafts.  Wife ordered reuben, I,  bbq ribs, waitress said ribs almost gone, that closed me.  When they came, not what you'd  expect, but a bunch of ends and fat and junk with sauce poured over, $18. If this was from my kitchen it never would've left the door. Sad presentation also. Reuben was fair, I  pushed ribs aside and ate half the sandwich. Seems like not only this and most others these days are mediocre at best , plus way overpriced for poor quality. Left with a $75 bill and a bad attitude ."}
{"text":"Good drinks, great view but the food is horrible. As a pub overall it is pretty mediocre. I have taken family here a couple times over the past year and have yet to have had a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Irish Pub in Cave Creek..  this restaurant has absolutely breathtaking views of the surrounding area. The dining area is light and bright, the patio is where you want to sit down and enjoy your favorite beverage while enjoying the view. We were greeted by the owner herself, she seated us and recommended we try the Ruben sandwich and so we did. Good suggestion! We also tried the Tuna melt and same here, it was pretty good.  The French fries.. not sure what seasoning they use but wow the fries are good!!! Little spicy w/ vinegar flavor.   Overall good experience, maybe we would like to see more options on the menu."}
{"text":"They had the air off today. It was just too hot to stay here and eat. We normally love this place but had invited friends to come up and we were hit with the owner turned the air off. Please don't do this again during the summer. We love you but when it's 100 outside no one wants to sweat just sitting there having a beer."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved there new bartender !!! The Ruben is to die for with chips . We will def be back for a sandwich and the new bartender !(: thank you for a good experience."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying... I liked this bar. Good views. Live music. Good people. Good bartenders... except one. But we'll get to that in a moment.   This has been my 'go to' place in Cave Creek for a couple months now. I try to stop in once or twice a week. The bartenders know me and have taken very good care of me. In return, I tip at 80% - 100%. I always do. These people work very hard for that money and I appreciate great service.  Everything is usually good until this one bartender is working. Let's call her 'K'. She has a real aversion for me for whatever reason. A couple friends who know of her have told me this is common, that I shouldn't let it bother me. The few times I have had to deal with her have been uncomfortable but there's usually another bartender and the experience is still a positive one.   That was not the case last night. It's been a very long week. I was tired and just wanted to sit at the bar, have a glass of wine and listen to some live music.  I sensed the tension the minute I sat down... this bartender was working solo and she let me know right away that I was NOT welcome at her bar.   Message received loud and clear. I paid for my (still full) glass of wine, got up and left.   I won't be back.    Why drive 25 minutes to Cave Creek and risk having this type of poor service be my only option. I can choose a favorite place in Scottsdale where I feel welcome. I can choose to spend my money somewhere else.  That's exactly what I intend to do."}
{"text":"Entirely mediocre food...although liked the vinegar addition to the fries in the Fish & Chips.  Service for lunch was friendly and efficient...nice touch having lightweight fleece blankets in baskets for outside patio diners.  Great greeter, \"Creeker\", the dog!  Ambiance: local bar meets cowboy-stop (riders can tie-up their horses in the dry creek below the bar).  Nothing to crow about....adequate food with friendly owners."}
{"text":"This pub is a good place to catch a pint with an amazing  view. I visited soon after they opened,\" and I got to meet the owners and I have to say they are great and charming people. I had the pub cheese and I was not impressed ... but it's pub cheese in cave creek so I didn't have huge expectations. They have great taste in what bands play there. Servers and tenders can make or break bars, PJ and John have been there since it opened and I for one hope they stick around, they make it a good place to hang around. Prost!"}
{"text":"Here's an idea: if you're pretending to be an Irish pub, how about some Irish music. The duo tonight playing Fleetwood Mac and Bob Dillon were begging for requests. So I asked for any Irish song. They didn't know even one. Weird."}
{"text":"Should have read the reviews first. These people are rank amateurs in the restaurant business. We did get a beer right away but then the service from the kitchen took forever with only 2-3 small groups ahead of us. The burger and chicken sandwiches were fine once we got them but the fish and chips should be called \"blackened\" as it looked dark and the only way fried stuff turns out that dark is if the grease hasn't been changed in eons. The final straw was we got overcharged on the burger (menu $8 + $1 for cheese) was $11 and the chicken sandwich (menu $9 + $2 bacon) was $14. I would have complained but we didn't have 30 minutes to wait to get it corrected!!!!!"}
{"text":"My gf and I stopped in on a Friday afternoon at 130'ish. We sat at the bar. Michelle, one of the owners poured us two perfect Guinness. Bartender Joe took over and added an Irish margarita, which was delightful. The Commodores came on overhead to sing about Sunday morning, we couldn't NOT sing along. When it was over we asked for a replay, and a little louder. They indulged us!!! So much fun. Michelle's husband, JP, came over to say hello because we were fawning over their dog, Creeker. What a great feel. I've been here before but this time felt different. Service was friendly and welcoming. In the past, servers and bartenders have seemed irritated and rushed. Perhaps the owners presence is a sign of good things to come."}
{"text":"Best way to describe this new pub is \"lots of potential\". Stopped in after a hike in the afternoon, and enjoyed a pint and wings. Small menu that I'm sure will grow. Great atmosphere with garage doors opening out to patio. Owner was onsite and staff were helpful and friendly. Hope it takes off."}
{"text":"Went in here to have a late lunch...about 5 people at bar and 2 sitting out on patio....we sat on patio to enjoy the view and that is all it's worth!! My hubby ordered a beer took 10 minutes to get it and we ordered burger and chicken sandwich, after 25 minutes no food, so I went inside to find waitress to pay for beer because we were not going to wait any longer, she never came back so we left money on table and hit the road....what a waste of space!!!"}
{"text":"visited here from out of town and i have one word... WOW! view was stunning and food was great. they also had live music... such a fun environment, we will be back!"}
{"text":"This our second time here. The pub burger is one of he best i've ever had. Absolutely delicious. Chef Ryan is a creative genius with flavor and menu design, creating a fantastic following. Thanks for coming out to introduce yourself and say hi. Looking forward to next time. Thank you. Next time desert please.   We loved sitting out in the patio with an awesome view of the mountains. Service is great and we will be back.  UPDATED:  Came back third time because it was so good the first two times. This was a totally terrible experience. I ordered the same thing again, burger medium with pepper jack cheese and bacon, side fries. Burger was well done on the very dry side. Server didn't order my fries until after burger came out. Bottles of ketchup, mustard and mayo were oily and gross. Fries were gross because oil cooked in was old. Waitress said she took care of fries for me. Gave me my bill. $12. Then comes back said she gave me wrong bill. Brings it back saying she took off the tea this time. Bill now $16. I see fries and bacon are now added into the charge. I won't be back and will stop telling people it's the best wine burger around. Terrible experience.  Correct the service and consistency of food."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving!! While the outside and inside was a great view the service was horrible. Meaning we walked in found a table and sat there for more than 15 minutess and not one employee came to take our drink order!! We didn't even get a menu. It was early enough in the day so it wasn't that busy. I was disappointed. We got up and walked out and not one person said anything!!!! Just plain rude."}
{"text":"Bad service, food wasn't worth the price .  Excellent bloody Mary's.   Its a absolutely beautiful bar , they should pay more attention to the service , food quality with relation to the price.  I won't return to eat."}
{"text":"Good place with Great views to grab a beer or drink. BUT Very limited Menu and an 'Irish' Pub out of Shepard's pie the weeknight we were there :(.   Great to have Live Music Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Also be aware, as others mentioned, very pungent smell later in the evening if you sitting on the patio. I hope they find and fix that as it spoils an otherwise great place to watch the sunset or soon to have a summer drink on a full moon night with the silhouette of the mountains!"}
{"text":"Dissappointed.  live here and heard it was good. Went for late lunch.very,limited,menu, and overpriced. ordered fish &¡chips.1 piece,fish, potatoe,chips,covered,with ???and sticky sweet coleslaw. ARmold.palmer drinks  not cold and weak.Wont go back."}
{"text":"We have been many times. Mainly for the great music. Went Sat nite to hear the music. The band never showed & we ordered dinner (unfortunately). Had a visitor in town for a visit and not only were we disappointed but embarrassed. The food was terrible. How you can mess up a burger is beyond me & the chicken strips were not good at all. Drinks & dinner for three came to over $80. What a waste. Our guest was surprised to get charged for rocks on her drink. Go figure.   We will possibly return for the music but not the food.  Service was okay. But not worth it."}
{"text":"Overpriced and really poor service. long waits for drinks and what seems to be an uncaring staff"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar got waited on by Joe and Jen both gave us great 5 star service. We enjoyed our usual drinks we get everywhere we go and we also did happy hour appetizers that were awesome we got the pretzel bites with beer cheese and the shrimp both were amazing! Great service surrounded by good people with amazing view what more could you ask for? JP and Michelle did a great job with this place and the detail."}
{"text":"We went their on a perfect Saturday night. We sat on the back patio overlooking the mountains and the valley. The air was fresh with a nice breeze. I had a grilled sandwich with cheese, bacon & tomato. My friend had one of the specials for the evening; baby back ribs. We had delightful meals, wonderful drinks, live music and awesome service. We had a wonderful time. If you are looking for atmosphere and a delightful evening, this is the place."}
{"text":"It's no joke! The mountain view's are incredible! A true Irish pub indeed! The food selection could be improved with more options but their pub nachos are legit...truly legendary! Nachos made with shepard's pie meat, peas and carrots! Their wait staff was attentive and made awesome recommendations for beer! Mountain View Pub was definitely a hidden gem that I wish I found earlier than my last day in AZ before heading back to San Diego!!! Leave them wanting more is exactly what they've done on me...I'll be back and can't wait!"}
{"text":"Terrific breakfast!!! I don't know what it is like as a bar but I hope they can make it as a breakfast joint.  Terrific view.  Great service. Very reasonable prices.  Food is served hot and just as you order it.  Very friendly place. Best breakfast in Cave Creek and Carefree"}
