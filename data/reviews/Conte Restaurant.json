{"text":"We got stranded in the Vulcan snow storm on the way to the airport and lucky for us we were close to this place! I have eaten in little italy a few times, and it was not nearly as good as Conte. The service was fantastic, the prices are fair, and the food is superb. The margharita pizza was super yum. The pasta arabiatta was really good too."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a great restaurant!  Authentic Italian food, made by a friendly Italian family.  Pasta fagioli was great, salad was outstanding (yes, even the salad) and the spaghetti w/ meat balls was the best.  If you're in Berea (or driving by on I-71), do yourself a favor and eat at Conte's."}
{"text":"I'm so grateful to Yelp for steering me to this hidden gem.  As others have noted, the exterior gives no hint to the terrific food and friendly atmosphere inside. Once you walk in the door, don't be put off by the fluorescent lighting and plastic tablecloths -- because what comes out of that kitchen is pure Italian home cooking.  I ate way too much, but it was so darn good:  homemade chicken stock in the Italian wedding soup; a huge pile of thinly sliced, light-as-a-feather eggplant parm; crusty fresh bread; and a couple of cannoli -- all for just over twenty bucks.    And the place is genuine, unpretentious and welcoming. I loved hearing the family-owners banter back and forth with each other in Italian; the server who called me \"sweetheart\"; and the fact that the owners seemed to know everyone who walked in the door. This place is the real deal.  Go.  Eat.  You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"This is by far the best real Italian food I can remember having.  We decided to try this place that happens to be close to my work and where I live based on the previous review.  I almost thought the last review seemed a little \"too good\" to be true but decided to take a chance anyways.  Everything the last reviewer was completely accurate.  I even mentioned the previous review and the owner remembered the people who wrote it and were happy to hear the positive feedback.  I noticed the wonderful smells as soon as we entered the restaurant (something rarely encountered in most restaurants).  Our meal started with the homemade bread (which the Italian owner gladly showed us rising on some metal trays for later today).  Myself, husband, and the two kids devoured the first loaf so they brought another.  My daughter and I shared the spaghetti and meatballs.  I usually would not order that meal for myself as it is not my favorite but agreed b/c my daughter loves it and I knew it would be way too much for her.  It was a huge order with two huge meatballs and definitely the best I can remember having.  They brought it out already split in two which really helped when sharing.  My 7 yr old daughter also raved about it.  The owner said she makes her sauce and meatballs fresh every morning and proud that there is no sugar in the sauce (the true Italian way).  My husband had the Chicken Marsala and it was out of this world good.  The chicken was so tender and had no breading on it.  It came out with two pieces and plenty of Marsala sauce.  It was so delicious that both of us dipped our bread in the leftover sauce until it was completely gone.  The funny part of this visit is that we ended up here after another restaurant we intended to go to was closed for the week.  We met 4 other strangers at the other restaurant who asked us for another recommendation upon finding out the place was closed.  We told them we were going to try out Conte but hadn't been there before.  They ended up following us to Conte and ate there as well.  They also raved about their meals which included huge chicken parm subs and the veal.  The owner said they always use high quality, fresh veal (nothing frozen).  The 4 strangers were very happy they took a chance by following us there.    I can't believe it took me this long to find such a fabulous restaurant so close to me.  The appearance from the front is very deceiving so I would not have tried it if not for the great reviews here.  The owners are putting all their time and energy into cooking high quality, true Italian food rather than decor.  Don't let that fool you too.  Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing! Authentic dishes, fresh ingredients, affordable and delicious! I'm usually very skeptical about places bc of my culinary background but this place was incredible. Other Yelpers were right the place isn't much to look at but just wait until the food arrives. You'll feel like you're in your grandmother's house in the heart of Italy!"}
{"text":"From the reviews We were disappointed. Salad was plain lettuce and carrots nothing special. Chicken parm was mushy and no taste. Broccolini was seasoned well but penne pasta and broccoli was overcooked."}
{"text":"Great little italian place.  I didn't expect much based on it being in a strip mall type of location, but it was worth stopping.  I would go again."}
{"text":"Exciting news!  The Contes are now cooking at the Front Row Bar and Grill in Brook Park (located on the corner of Snow and Smith Roads).  The food is still as good as we remember it!  So glad that their food is still available!  Go say hello to the Contes and enjoy their remarkable food!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other reviewer of the place.  A gem in the midst of a strip mall....  GOOD STUFF:  Cheap great Italian food cooked by old ladies speaking Italian.  Portions are huge (we got two entrees and it was way too much food to eat in one setting).  Prices are cheap.  BAD STUFF:  If you're looking for fancy fine dining this isn't the place.  Its clean and has a solid authentic feel to it but the decor is not to impress.  PRICE:  30-40$ for two people even if you order a ton of food...cheap  OVERALL:  I was amazed to find such great Italian food at this location.  Really, really good and definitely worth a visit.  Beats many of the places on the east side in little Italy hands down."}
{"text":"The first time i was there for a 40th bday the  food was amazing, but service was very disorganized. Our family went back for another bday party and it was horrible. We made reservation waaay ahead of time and they were still very unprepared. They did not have homemade gnocchi (which is why the bday girl picked this place). It was only 6pm in the evening so its not like they ran out! No lemon for waters, no sugar or creamer for coffee and the food was just ok at this visit! OH and then they brought the wrong dinner to the table and seemed put off by fixing it and the one dish that asked for meat sauce had NO meat.  Very chaotic experience! I would probably not go back. After reading the above review i def will not go there!! WOW...who do these men and business owners think they are? Why does Contes have two Review links...i'm posting on both!"}
{"text":"HOLY balls, this place is awesome. I'll do the short, cliffs-notes version:  -Authentic -Hole in the wall -Family-owned -Friendly -Middle of nowhere -Veal Parm = redonk -Salad served with everything at no extra cost -Bread & butter -Don't judge a book by its cover: looks a little run down but is run perfectly and the food is (first time I'm ever using this word in real life) amazeballs. -Only Italian I've had in the CLE area that has rivaled my favorite NY places. -I will probably never go back to another Italian restaurant in CLE other than this one and maybe Stino Da Napoli."}
{"text":"Such a FANTASTIC hidden gem!  I found this place by searching for restaurants within a certain radius of where my Aunt lives...all of the reviews said the same thing, and I will echo their sentiments, ignore the d√©cor of this hole-in-the-wall and just dive in, you won't be disappointed!  We had the wedding soup (as good as my great-grandmothers, sorry Grama Guzzo!) and we all enjoyed our entrees.  We ordered the lunch portions of each entree and still had half leftover for dinner!  Oh Madone, this place is GOOD!  I'm already planning a trip back to Cleveland just to eat here!  :)"}
{"text":"Without having had much success tracking down decent food in the airport area of Cleveland, I was thrilled to have the chance to try Conte's.  Walking in almost felt like home and the staff were all very friendly.  The food was awesome- the Pollo Marsala was fantastic.  The Piccata my colleague had was equally as delicious (I stole some off of his plate.)  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"La Cucina Italiana! This is an authentic Trattoria. Maria cooks from the heart.  The best in northern Ohio!"}
{"text":"Honestly, do yourself a favor and visit this restaurant!  We visited conte's after the home and garden show and we were totally impressed!   Everything is home made by \"momma\" and is so incredibly flavorful.  The staff is warm and friendly and so very kind.  A great \" mom and pop place\" that cooks far beyond the cookie cutter chains.  By the time we left I felt like the owners were a part of my family.   5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"As an update....sadly, the restaurant snuck out in the middle of the night! We were there the night before and went back the next night and it was banged up and closed. I peaked inside and all that was there was a land line phone! They got to know us well as were there often and consistently, so to be honest, I was actually offended that they didn't warn us that they were closing. On the flip side, at least I was able to stick to a diet and lose weight. I'm sure that wouldn't have happened if my obsession with this place had continued."}
{"text":"It doesn't get more authentic than this...the daughter waits on the tables and Mama makes the food.  It's an open-kitchen-meets- small-cafe setting with maybe 4 booths and 5 tables.  Nothing fancy...plastic coated tablecloth and laminated placemats.  You get the idea.  I have been searching for a place like this since I moved to Cleveland.  A girl I work with told me about it.  She's full-blooded Italian so I figured I couldn't go wrong.  The spaghetti and meatballs is a huge portion served with 2 meatballs and meat sauce.  The flavor of the meat sauce is superb...authentic tomato taste.  And the meatballs are delicious.  Only $10.  The chicken parmigiana was 2 pieces of chicken and a side of penne pasta.  $12.95.  The mozzarella sticks are pretty good.  All entrees come with a small salad with straight up oil and vinegar salad dressing.  Fresh bread is brought to the table when you are seated.  Good selection of chicken and veal dishes as well as pasta dishes.  For a one-mama kitchen operation, you can tell she cooks her heart out!  The *only* odd thing is the distance the daughter stands from the table while taking your order.  No joke...she must have stood 4 feet away from our table (making me wonder if I had b-o).  No alcohol is served.  They do take credit cards.  Forget Little Italy...this place is the real deal."}
{"text":"Having grown up in Brooklyn NY and lived in the Northeast most if my life, I love Italian food.  I recently moved to the Midwest and found myself at a loss for good food.  I made it my personal quest to find quality places to eat.  Don't go to Conte's for ambiance.  The place does not look like anything from the outside or inside for that matter (my first clue that this place had potential).  Go to Conte's if you like authentic Italian food that you would find in New York. I won't go through the menu because everybody has their favorites but everything that I ate was delicious.   I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ratchet!  Entrees were terrible. I would Definitely not recommend this restaurant. The eggplant was over-cooked and had very little flavor. I was very disappointed and have no clue as to why reviewers are recommending the eggplant."}
{"text":"Fantastic family run hole-in-the-wall place. As others have noted not a fancy place but the food is excellent.   I had the italian wedding soup and the pollo dello chef, which was served with ziti. So so good. My mother had the veal cicialno. Equally good. Chicken was flavorful and well cooked. The cheesy sauce was addictive and delectable. The pasta was al dente, and didn't taste like watery junk. I kind of enjoyed that we could watch the activity in a main part of the kitchen from our seats.    Far less expensive and a far better dinner than most mid-level not quite fancy italian restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm going to be real honest here, after reading the reviews, I had such high expectations for the food here.  SEVERE DISAPPOINTMENT.  I'll say the  service was great, but that's about it.  Appetizers: Wedding  Soup - 5/10 Calamari - 4/10  Definitely frozen calamari from a place like GFS or the equivilient, the breading was not crispy at all.  The salad, ha, laughable, a few pieces of iceberg lettuce and some shredded carrots on top.  Definitely not what I'd call a salad.  Bread was decent, a little overdone, but it did come out piping hot so that was a positive.  I got the chicken parm.  Imagine this, two frozen breaded chicken patties with a mound of burnt cheese on top.  I have no idea how they burnt the cheese this bad, maybe put it under a broiler??  The cavatelli's I got on the side were soggy.  Eggplant parm was the same way.  But with even more burnt cheese on top.  I really have no idea where the positive reviews are coming from.  Two people, and the bill was almost $50.  Not exactly cheap, and definitely not authentic.  Everything screamed GFS (other than the home made sauce, but it didn't have much flavor).  Do yourself a favor and go to Olive Garden over this place."}
{"text":"This is a small family run Italian kitchen, that does has some room for improvement. The food here is VERY GOOD! I had the chicken piccata, which aside from being a little salty was very good. My Co-workers also loved their dishes as well. The portions were very good sized, and the prices are very reasonable. They did use good ingredients.  They could use some help though. The store front was not much, and almost scared us away. Don't let the run down look keep you away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The restaurant was a bit of a mess. The place had dishes stacked on the counters in the dining area. The staff were friendly and spent lots of time talking with many of the customers who mostly seem to know each other.   Don't go here if your in a rush. They could use more staff if they want to make the place improve."}
{"text":"Come for the food.  Come back for... the food.  Looks-wise it was even more hole in the wall than I expected.  Food was nice, though I found both the veal piccata and the salad vinaigrette a little salty.  The veal was tender and lovely, with just the right amount of crisping and sauce. Entrees come with a bit of ziti and marinara, which was great, and with the criticized iceberg-and-carrots salad--which I was fine with, since it was very fresh and had a nice light vinaigrette.  They give you a nice fresh loaf of bread, hot from the oven.  They have excellent olive oil--I had the caprese and mopped up the extra with my bread. Nice service, far better than I would expect from a place with plastic glasses and vinyl tablecloths.  It looks sort of like someone opened a restaurant in that back room they weren't using, and it's very homey--but the food and the price? Just right.   BYOB - the people who just came in have wine with them.  And the woman running the place, Italian, knows many of her customers. It's a great atmosphere if you don't care about having candles and white linens.   Pasta fagioli IS excellent.  An enjoyable dinner.  I've had worse Italian in NYC, and paid a lot more, too.  I think my favorite aspect of the ambience is the TV above my head that's set on an Italian channel.  Something about hearing the language really adds to it all. ;)  And since I don't speak it and I'm not watching it, it isn't distracting at all."}
{"text":"Don't come if your a foodie..but its a nice example of a very good layed back Italian american restaurant without the airs and graces. Simple red and white checkered table clothes, flouresent lights...some are dead.   Service is good...with a smile and attentive.   They just painted the place, still need to hang the art.  I had the penne ametriciana (matricana) which isn't exactly out of the Rome recipe book, but hit the spot. The pizzas look excellent... And the little garden salads and bread where superb.    If you like wine, order a glass from a fresh bottle"}
{"text":"Delicious, excellent service!  So friendly.  I received a hug and a handshake when I walked in the door. Fresh, housemade bread arrived with a simple salad. The vinaigrette was freshly made which totally made the salad. My girlfriend had the Pollo Della Chef. 2 chicken breasts filled with Mascarpone and spinach, covered in a brandy cream sauce. I almost died it was so good!  I had the chicken piccata. So yum!  Nice big capers in the lemon butter sauce. And the portion was very generous. Who needs a fancy dining room when you have authentic, well prepared food at reasonable prices. Definitely a place I will frequent."}
{"text":"We found this wonderful family place and the food was great.  I had chicken parm and it was the best I have had.  Paul had the carbonara.  The bread was hot from the oven.  Everything was made to order.  We would go back if we lived in Cleveland.  They are very friendly!"}
{"text":"I was a regular at Contes when I lived down the street from the original location. I refer any and everyone who is looking for Italian as they make the best in Cleveland in my opinion. When I found out they relocated to Front Row I immediately planned to make a trip across town to enjoy one of my favorite meals. I called ahead and they insisted that it was the same exact food that was served at the original location. When seated I didn't even need a menu because I knew I wanted the Fettuccine Alfredo add chicken. Contes has never been inexpensive so I didn't expect it to be inexpensive here either despite the bar setting. However it was a surprising $13 which was a bit cheaper than Contes if I remember correctly.   I received my salad accompanied by a tiny premade toasted dinner roll. Anyone who frequents Contes knows that the bread is always freshly made but I let it fly. The salad was different as well because the original Contes salad never came with cheese let alone two types. And the dressing taste like normal Italian which must have also been premade. I suspect things may have changed a little because after all this is just a small bar and no longer the authentic little Italian restaurant I used to frequent. It took a while to come out which didn't bother me either because I know it takes time to make such a good meal. I used to watch the owner prepared the meal straight from her kitchen therefore the wait never bothered me.   Anywho when I received my pasta my boyfriend immediately asked was it a lunch portion and I thought the same but decided not to complain. The noodles were linguini and not fettuccine but that didn't bother me either. Another change was the fact that the chicken was cut into small square pieces and they were beyond dry. I'm used to a very moist whole piece of chicken or two. The worse part was the fact that the noodles way undercooked and clumped together. The alfredo sauce didn't even taste the same and there were no roasted garlic cloves. Because I respect the food Contes has produced in the past I decided not to picture the food because it was just that bad. I tried to eat it but I just couldn't so I told the waiter (who by the way was very nice). She insisted that it was the original Conte family in the back preparing the food and that she would have it fixed. However, I was totally turned off and declined.   I really miss Contes and I hope that one day they return in a different location and serve the same home cooked meals they once produced. I enjoyed going there after a long day at work and enjoying a great meal accompanied by good customer service from the family."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian place in Cleveland. Though not much to look at, but the food is delicious. Their puttanesca sauce is perfection. My lady loves the cavatelli and peas with the pink sauce. Go hungry with friends and embrace the food."}
{"text":"A co worker turned me on to this place and boy was I  not disappointed. I won't comment further on the decor as it has been well documented, but when the food is as good as this who cares? They could serve it in the parking lot for all I care.   I haven't ordered lasagna in a restaurant in years until today. Its so good you  better sit down. The wedding soup shows you what real soup is and not the crap you get at Olive Garden or any other chain restaurant. It was homemade and fantastic. Prices are reasonable and a must try for any Italian lover. Great job Conte family, I'll be back........soon."}
{"text":"I was taught never judge a book by its cover and this place is a great example. If you have read my \"About Me\" you will know I love Italian food. This place has unbelievable, authentic, Southern Italian food. I had the lasagna served with a tossed salad and bread sticks. The portion served was very generous. I seen on Yelp that everybody gave it 5 stars and thought it was a fluke. I'm here to tell you right now it's not. Not much on the outside but what comes out the kitchen is pure magic."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!!    I lived in Naples, Italy for seven years - this food was exactly what one could expect in a trattoria in Southern Italy.    I had a Caprese salad and Spaghetti Carbonara and could not have been more pleased.  Caprese salad is alternating layers of mozzarella  di buffalo and sliced tomatoes, finished with a drizzle of olive oil, a dash of salt, a touch of basalmic vinegar, and fresh basil.  Usually I am disappointed with Caprese salad because it's darn near impossible to get authentic mozzarella in the US.  This one was perfect, as if it had beamed over that very instant from Naples.     Likewise, I am usually disappointed with Carbonara in the US because it's generally not correct - I usually end up with alfredo sauce and crumbled bacon - but Conte's was perfect, no alfredo in sight, nor crumbled bacon.  Instead it was authentic Carbonara which is based on eggs, parmesan, and pancetta (not crumbled bacon) and was totally as I have it experienced in Italy.  The service was great, and the people are very friendly in that southern Italy sort of way.     If you can't afford a trip to Italy you should try Conte for a genuinely authentic Italian trattoria experience!"}
{"text":"The food was great. Felt like true home made Italian food. The server was courteous and gorgeous. I would definitely consider coming back on my next trip to  Cleveland."}
{"text":"Mama Mia!  Yes!  Thanks fellow yelpers!  This is a great find.  Went for lunch.  Thought I would eat just one of my meatballs and half my spaghetti...every bite was so yummy I just wanted another until there was none.   I found my bliss point!   I'll be back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for lunch. It is a very small space but warm and homey. I ordered eggplant parm which I eat whenever I go to an Italian restaurant. It was one of the best versions of the dish I have ever had. A very good portion with a side of rigatoni. Salad was good and the bread was fresh and hot. My husband ordered spaghetti and meatballs which he really enjoyed. Neither of us could finish our entrees.This will be my go to restaurant whenever I crave Italian. Very friendly service. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I concur with all of the other reviews, this place brought me back to my Grandmother's Italian cooking. Pasta fagioli was excellent, chicken parm was fabulous. I agree the appearance isn't all that but it more than makes up for it with the food."}
{"text":"Excellent review and great service.  Sat right next to the kitchen and watched them prepare the food.  If you are in the area definitely Go."}
{"text":"My friend and I have been on a food mission. We had to travel to Chicago from central Florida on business so decided to hit every restaurant we could find. We have been called food snobs because we really enjoy great food and we are very pickyI try and do a review on yelp on each restaurant that we dine in. Especially some of the ones we have tried from triple D's which were very disappointing.  Anyway back to the person who gave this place three stars when you haven't even stepped foot into the place is beyond me!!!!  Yes this place is nothing to look at inside and out and it is true the food sure makes up for it.  The other great thing about this place is that you can bring your own wine.  My friend ordered the chicken marsala that came with a salad and a side of pasta in a wonderful red sauce. The chicken was fork tender with mushrooms on top and the marsala sauce was a light sauce and not heavy or over powered by the marsala. The salad is just iceberg lettuce with some matchstick carrots. Nothing fancy but the salad dressing was not just straight up oil and vinegar but something they make up themselves. The bread they serve comes out of the oven nice and hot and real crusty. I could have eaten a whole loaf with the real butter they serve.   I ordered the eggplant parm that was outstanding. I usually like my eggplant breaded then stacked. This was not breaded but fantastic and the portion was out of control. You could easily split the dinner but of course not me.   I also ordered a side dish of gnocchi that was covered in a red sauce and melted mozzarella on top. Now this dish was not on the dinner menu but I saw it on the lunch menu and asked Maria if I could get an order and she told me in her heavy Italian accent \"but of course. I make you anything you want\". Now this dish was enough for three people easy. Oh yeah. I also had the pasta fagioli soup that was out of this world. You can tell everything is home made. It is so nice to go into a family restaurant instead of a chain. Maria who cooks all day with her son and also takes your order and brings your food to the table with the help of her husband and what a joy to listen to the chatter in the back in Italian and the pounding of the chicken and veal and the huge pots in the kitchen that they must cook all the sauces in.  We just couldn't bring ourselves to order dessert.  I highly recommend this place and the prices are more than reasonable"}
{"text":"Delicious.  People were friendly.  Food was amazing.  Prices were solid.  Just dropped by while waiting for flight to arrive at Cleveland airport."}
{"text":"Have eaten here 4 times in the last 6 months and is my go to Italian Restaurant on the west side of Cleveland. I asked Crystal, my server if there is anything better than the veal saltimbaca and she steered me to the veal Italiano. Veal cutlets with eggplant and cheese. I believe you can't go wrong with any veal. The chicken parm and seafood pasta are also excellent. If your traveling through Cleveland it's worth getting off the turnpike and traveling 10 minutes to experience this jewel! Bring your own wine. No corkage fee!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a drive from Pittsburgh to Minneapolis based on other Yelp reviews.  Yep, the outside looks run-down. But as others noted the food is really good and very reasonably priced. I think the entire Conte family works there and they are friendly. They readily worked around my wif'e's food allergies. Interior is a bit underwhelming.  The portions are really large and the prices are more than fair. The special on 6/26/13 was eggplant parm with one side (vege or pasta), salad and a soft drink for $7.95.  Wife and daughter #3 had this and loved it.  Compare this to a 6\" sub, bag of chips and a drink at Subway.  I had spaghetti puttenesca which I enjoyed and daughter #2 had penne with vodka sauce which was also very good.  We could have shared one pasta dish for two. I think both dishes were $10.95.  The salad was the weak link with just some iceburg and carrots, but the home-made dressing was good.  We all enjoyed the grilled eggplant and zucchini.  Total for 4 people with 4 entrees and two appetizer and drinks: $54  I am giving this five stars, but this is not an over the top place. I am giving it five stars because the food (except the salad) was very good, service very friendly, the portions very generous and the prices are kind to the wallet and we would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Ate here last night for the first time and it definitely won't be our last. This is an amazingly friendly family run restaurant.  Our server Crystal welcomed us and asked where we would like to sit, which with our very active 2 year old a table works better than a booth for us.    I felt like we were visiting my adopted Italian grandparents house with a few distant cousins who had stopped by too. Eating out with a 2 year old is always a roll of the dice...perfect little guy or.....well....we have all seen that kid that you feel bad for the parents or yourself for having to eat near him.   Anyway, the food was lovely.  The pasta was cooked perfectly.  They made a \"side\" of whatever pasta I wanted for the little guy with whatever sauce I wanted--not on the menu--but they were happy to do it.  Everything was delicious. Hubby & I both had carbonara....yum!"}
