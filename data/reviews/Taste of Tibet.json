{"text":"Our Dubuque, IA port town needs Tibetan food like this! We brought our toddler son to this quaint & artsy gem in Madison, WI & I loved it's simplicity! The sticky buns were also a hit, plus the lovely staff knew the items fabulously well! Not only was the food ready after I took an hour to order; then changed my mind from the veggie dumplings to the ginger tofu-but the food was hot, not like luke warm for a change. Paintings are beautiful & the colors, including the frames had a very ecclectic look even! Flavor's were mild, as we ordered the buttered noodles for our little on, chkn dumplings, potato app, & ginger tofu. The ginger tofu hd a bit of a bite to it but not as hot as the spicy hot sauce that accompanied the chkn dumplings. I would go back there again just so i could try the green looking dumplings! lol! Enjoy this delicate & light meal! I was curious about dessert too!"}
{"text":"I've never had Tibetan food before, so I had no idea what to expect, but I liked this place.  The owner/waiter was very friendly and accommodating, and the food was fresh and tasty.  Reasonable prices and portion sizes, and cool pictures of the mountains. Come here for an interesting alternative for tired Chinese food.  Also, they have yak meat!"}
{"text":"We really liked this place.  I would especially recommend it for a lunch on a cold day.  It really struck me as good, hearty comfort food.  We loved the steamed buns.  They are sort of like having a good dumpling in Eastern European cuisine. We had great service even though every table was full.  It is a small place with limited seating like many others on State Street."}
{"text":"The steamed buns, hot noodle soup, and ginger tea at Taste of Tibet are perfect on a cold winter day. Don't expect a lot of bold or intense flavors from the sauces and spices in the food. The flavors here are more subtle. Do expect fresh and tasty vegetables. They are never overcooked. The service here is very friendly, too."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new place on state street. I went in with my friends today for dinner. I liked the appetizer we got, some vegetable pancakes were yummy. I ordered Tofu Chili with rice for my entr√©. My friend ordered Tofu Veg with bread. The look of food were not that attractive when they serve. Both foods' taste were tasteless and blend. I asked my Tofu Chili as spicy but I did not taste anything and I could say boring taste. Very watery - wonder why it was so blend? I don't think they put any spices like salt and such. I am guessing that's healthy? I don't know what they put in, so I can't really say it. but it looked and tasted like just boiled veges and tofu in water. I am not kidding. If you are curious, you should try. I don't think I will go back there unless somebody is paying for it. then I will only get pancakes, but I don't think that's worth to drop by.  It maybe just me who loves indian, thai, korean foods. I may not have tongue for tibetan foods."}
{"text":"Stopped into this place while looking for a unique place for dinner on State Street.  The atmosphere was very quiet, and we enjoyed people-watching from the big picture window.  I had a bowl of beef soup with spinach, carrots, daikon, and hand-pulled noodles.  The broth was fantastic - very rich and smooth.  My companions had dumpling soup and a vegetable tofu dish, and had nothing but good things to say.   The prices were ungodly cheap for the amount of food.  We didn't try appetizers, but easily could have and still been coming out under $15 a person.  I'd definitely go back, I'd like to try the yak meat!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the spicy zing of Thai or Indian food, Tibetan is not a great fit. But if tasty and hearty/rib sticking food to get you through the day is what you are looking for, then Taste of Tibet should be part of your rotation. After all, who doesn't like dumplings? The decor is simple, but pleasant and the folks who run the place are real nice, so give it a try..."}
{"text":"The Beef Then Thuk (a beef and noodle soup resembling pho) was outstanding. Savory, plentiful, and extremely well-seasoned. I ate with a large group and got to try a little bit of everything. And as for everything else...  \"what the hell is this thing?\" \"Why is this cold?\" \"You have to walk to the liquor store around the corner if you want alcohol.\" \"All my utensils are dirty.\" \"Did these vegetables come out of a bag?\" \"This tastes like paper.\" \"Please, get it away from me.\" \"What were they trying to accomplish with this dish?\" \"No do not box these up please just throw them away.\""}
{"text":"As a disclaimer, this is the first time I have ever tried Tibetan food (because... Himal Chuli and Chautara are Nepalese... right?). Novice disclaimer aside, this place is absolutely fantastic.  I'm currently still basking in food coma glow as I write this while i nurse my momo baby. haha.  My little brother and I walked in during a study break, not knowing what to expect and we were both happily surprised. The place is immaculate and the servers are sooo incredibly sweet and attentive. We had 3 dishes- beef sha momos, beef gyanthuk and chicken fried rice. Momos are Tibetan dumplings... and really, who doesn't love dumplings, especially if they come with hot sauce?! Gyanthuk actually reminded me a bit of japanese ramen. SOOO good. I should've asked for chopsticks--I'm so messy with forks. ha. And the fried rice was solid (honestly though, it's pretty hard to screw up fried rice. haha).  In summary. Everything was delicious and the amount of food served was absolutely perfect. It definitely has the family-owned business feel and I hope this restaurant is wildly successful and more so, I hope this restaurant becomes and STAYS a State St staple =)"}
{"text":"Service was great, even with a whole credit card bill splitting snafu. They were very accomodating in our requests for changes to the menu and always attending to us.  It was our first time trying out Tibetan food. It's a bit bland and not as much flavor as Chinese, Thai or Laotian food. We had the ginger shrimp-fried, battered shrimp was a bit soggy in the sauce, momos-dumplings, chicken curry-yummy, and two other beef dishes that slip my mind right now. Overall, not a bad place to eat, but we really wanted to throw in some sriracha or a bit more salt."}
{"text":"We came in after a busy day of bike riding, beer, and volleyball and it hit the spot. We had a variety of steamers which were okay - the shrimp one was definitely the best. Make sure you try the Tibetan hot sauce - yummy. Very reasonably priced too.  They let us BYOB (is that legit?), as we had some beer in a backpack. I might go back again for BYOB, but I don't think I'd come out of my way for just the food."}
{"text":"I'd never had Tibetan food, but I figured on hearty, stew-like dishes featuring chicken. I am a great guesser.   I had the ginger chicken with rice. Rice, chicken, and a thick orange sauce made for a hearty meal. Well-flavored, it wasn't as spicy as I would have guessed from ginger being the focus. The consistency and general flavors reminded me a bit of tikka masala, and like tikka masala, I'd be happy to eat the sauce spooned over rice any day of the week. The chicken was good, but kind of freaked me out - the pieces were all little one-inch balls. To my knowledge, there's no place on a chicken that naturally forms that way, and it wasn't a nugget - the balls were actual chunks of chicken. So confused.   One friend tried the chili chicken, and cleaned his plate. Another friend got the fried veggie patties appetizer (good), and rice soup (off-putting). Since you get your choice of veggie or chicken broth, she thought it would be a clear broth with some rice and maybe chopped up veggies. Nope. It came out looking like Cream of Wheat - or like really, really wet rice. It didn't taste like much, and was just too much of one thing.   Also, Madisonians, if you're not sure where this is, I'm fairly certain it used to be the Sony store."}
{"text":"I don't know if authentic Tibetan food is supposed to be bland and visually unappealing, but that's what I've gotten the two times I've eaten here.  We didn't have any problems with service, but the food was just bad."}
