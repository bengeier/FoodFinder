{"text":"Went to Walnut Wednesday today and got the steak tacos (2 for $9). The tacos had onion, lettuce, cilantro, steak, table cream and cheese all wrapped in a corn tortilla.  I would have liked to seen a hot sauce or salsa of some sort added for extra heat and less cilantro, but overall there was a good, fresh flavor profile.  They definitely didn't skimp on the steak and I think two tacos would be plenty for most people. I'd give the tacos three stars, but with the fast service (had my tacos in less than 3 minutes), I'm bumping them up to four."}
{"text":"Our company in Mentor had Motormouth food truck cater a meal.  The food was excellent! We had Duo Entr√©e of Hanger Steak and Chicken, Chive Hollandaise and Port Wine Dry Cherry sauce on side, Marinated Grilled Vegetables,Herbed Red skin potatoes with Bacon Vinaigrette, Apple Slaw and Mini Cheesecakes for dessert.  The beverage was Iced Tea and Lemonade.   I liked the way the vegetables were served, cooked but cold so they would not be mushy when the last person was served.  The marinade made it taste awsome.  The asparagus had just the right crunch and flavor.  To serve 70 people from a truck is amazing.  I am particular on my steak and I like it  medium rare, and that is exactly what I got.  The flavor was just like a ribeye that I had a Longhorns a week ago except this was more tender.  Chicken was done perfectly also right from the grill.  I was near the end of the line and there was plenty of food to go around.  It was the best lunch time meal our company ever served."}
{"text":"I've been to a number of food trucks (anytime a food truck is downtown for lunch, I manage to track it down!) and I visit MotorMouth regularly because the food is consistently delicious and served quickly!  I've tried the grilled cheese, korean beef tacos, fish tacos, chicekn cordon bleu sandwich, pork sandwich, and fish sandwich.  Each menu item I've had offers a unique take on a traditional sandwich or taco - and it works!  Keep it up MotorMouth and keep coming downtown!"}
{"text":"Eh. That's all I got.   The service and presentation was good. Classic foodie look and feel. The food itself just wasn't amazing. It was good and I guess for the price, good. I just had a much better tasting dish at other trucks. I believe I had the pulled pork. It was great. The fish taco was the disappointing one. I will try it again of course but I'm not sold it will be better."}
{"text":"First time I visited was St. Patty's day. I had the corned beef burger. Hand ground patty, cabbage, thousand island, so tender and juicy. I don't know how it stayed together, but it was amazing and a great size for the price. Here's hoping this gets added to the menu on a regular rotation.  Service is fast and friendly, food is fresh and delicious with some inventive twists. The grilled cheese is amazing - cheddar and blue cheese together on toasty bread - the perfect comfort food.  My friend swears by the beef tacos. And don't forget a mexican brownie! Spicy and sweet, just a little exotic and a great end to a good meal.  Of all the food trucks, this one is probably my favorite and am excited to see what delicious ideas they come up with next."}
{"text":"Tried the Korean BBQ Beef Tacos at MotorMouth.  $8 for 2 tacos--about the same size as the tacos you would get at Chipotle--filled with grilled steak, hoison BBQ sauce, shredded lettuce, cucumber kimchi, and table cream.  I liked the corn tortillas and the relatively sizable strips of grilled steak, but the taste overall was underwhelming.  The cucumber kimchi did not add much, as the flavor was primarily driven by the hoison sauce which is then dulled down by the cream.  The effort was appreciated, but the tacos are a little too pricey for what you get--I would definitely opt for another one of the menu items should I visit again.  The line and wait for food took about five minutes total towards the end of the lunch hour.  The wind whipping down East 9th made certain that I felt every second of those five minutes.  If you have to trek back to your office before eating, ask for some foil to cover your basket of food."}
{"text":"My first Walnut Wednesday experience and it was kind of cool to see all of those food trucks together and crowds of hungry downtowners waiting to order.  I had the Korean BBQ tacos, and I'd have to agree with Jason V.'s review. It was decidedly average. I wasn't expecting authentic kalbi, so I guess I wasn't disappointed. The meat was somewhat dry with only a faint taste of the godlike Korean BBQ marinade. I am not sure I got hoison sauce in mine, and if I did it was very little. The cucumber kimchi also only had a faint taste of authentic kimchi, which just left me wanting the real thing. The best thing about it was the corn tortillas, which were mouthwatering and had that delicious grilled corn flavor that just tastes like summer. The problem was that it was so flavorful that it overpowered everything else at times. I am no chef but I feel like the following changes could knock this one out of the ballpark: a stronger kalbi marinade, a more potent kimchi (and maybe cabbage instead of cucumber), and maybe a flour tortilla instead of corn.  The wait wasn't long at all, which was likely helped by the masses being lined up at the other trucks. Maybe there was a reason for that. I would probably try this truck again, but definitely not the Korean tacos. They get points for at least being creative."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews, given that this is quickly becoming my favorite food truck in Cleveland.   I've found their food to be fresh & colorful, unique combinations that aren't TOO unique - just offbeat enough to keep you interested, like apricot BBQ pulled pork. Their fish tacos are light & airy & flavorful, & even though the fish is lightly fried, they're topped with so many veggies that they almost feel healthy! Motormouth's owner prefers not to serve fried foods (I guess the fish is an exception), so you'll find lots of other almost-healthy options on their ever-changing menu - & large portions, to boot.  They don't necessarily have the glitz & glam of other trucks, nor do they have the major reputation (yet) that some of the others have garnered for themselves, so you might be inclined to pass over Motormouth at Walnut Wednesdays or the Tremont Farmers Market. I encourage you not to, & to give them I try. I certainly haven't been disappointed by them yet!"}
{"text":"We had Motormouth cater our wedding out at Keystone Shelter in the Metroparks and all we can say is, AMAZING! They were great in every way. We were able to have them pull up right next to the shelter for full cover from the rain. Our cocktail hour service was top notch! We had passed appetizers including a mouthwatering steak crostini, along with the mojo braised short ribs. SO GOOD! Our main course, which was buffet style, included pulled pork sliders, confit chicken wings and shrimp skewers to name a few, all delicious! All our guests were raving about how amazing the food was all night long!  Everything leading up to the big day was on point. Communication was always professional and we always felt confident in all our decisions with them. We were so confident with Motormouth, we never even had a taste testing!! It all worked out flawlessly!   We will always recommend MotorMouth to anyone looking for someone to cater their event or even for just a quick bite.   Thanks to Team MotorMouth for making our wedding day perfect!"}
{"text":"Well I'm not a food truck pro BUT I do love good food and the Shroom Sandwich was delicious :) I loved it!! I wouldn't change a thing about it and it was the best of the 4 foods we tried here at food truck Friday! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I was walking across Public Square in downtown Cleveland yesterday when I noticed this food truck called Motor Mouth.  I worked downtown for three years and never saw one food truck!  I love food trucks, so I had to try it.  I ordered the steak flatbread and a green tea.  A few minutes later, my name was called and my order was ready.  When the cook handed me my styrofoam container, it felt light.  As I walked away, I opened it up and was a little disappointed by what I saw.  I saw a thick, grilled flatbread, some greens, some sauce and a little bit of steak.  It looked appetizing, but small.    When I got back to my car, I scarfed it down.  It was actually delicious!  The sandwich was $8.00 and the drink was $2.  I may try some other things on the menu if I find this truck again, but for the price, I don't think it was worth it.  It was tasty though!"}
{"text":"My experience with MotorMouth wasn't good and wasn't bad. They had an extremely long line this past Wednesday because a few of the food trucks didn't show up for walnut wednesday - there were longer lines at every truck. Anyways, I ordered the Shrimp Tacos. The description on the board was better than the product, I think . If I'm going to wait about 30 minutes for a couple tacos, they better be amazing! The tortilla was a little too charred (and I like them on the charred side), the mango and peach salsa was... tough? it certainly didn't remind me of the buttery mangoes I'm used to! The avocado ... drizzle ... was a low percentage of actual avocado. The one element that was assuredly perfect in this dish was the shrimp. Cooked perfectly and what gained this experience 3 stars."}
