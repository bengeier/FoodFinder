{"text":"Smoked ribs were perfect, tasted like southern bbq to me. Plenty of flavour ... maybe just a bit too salty for a non salt lover."}
{"text":"Great saloon bar atmosphere as soon as we walked in the door...Hot wings were fantastic..so we're mild...meat platter could be shared...delicious..great waitress...We will be back."}
{"text":"When it was a bar and grill, much better. Ever since their expansion, things seemed to have gone downhill. Food is mediocre at best and have made me ill, and for whatever reason, there has been no air-conditioning for the past few weeks when it's been over 30 degrees outside, closer to 40 with the humidity. It's a pity the owner has come to care so little about his business"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends before seeing a show and oh boy, what a disaster!!  Stay away from this place and I mean stay away!! We ordered the southern fried chicken sandwiches( they come with a choice of two sides) here comes the fun stuff if you want your \" free side\" to be onion rings 1$ extra, sauce for the fries $1-2 extra can't really remember) i chose the sweet potato and beans( reminded me of canned beans that i would eat during a hurricane mostly, no taste whatsoever) the chicken on both sandwiches we had was way over- fried ( it was grey and black actually) oh and cold and it left a horrible aftertaste. At this point i was in a rush and skeptical of this whole place as on normal occasion I would have argued to not have to pay for that garbage and I regret eating it. Even simple things like the sides were basically frozen onion rings although they lied to us that they were fresh and the fries were hard like a piece of wood and just plain pork feed!! Will i ever come back here?? NO WAY!! NEVER!!"}
{"text":"It smells funky. Burnt chicken fingers  and blue cheese was yellow and congealed.  Wings were small for a pound of wings. Cesar salad was soaked in dressing.  Burger bun was soggy close the kitchen door. Looks nasty in there too  Positive Beer was good cold and fresh.  Conclusion by drinks not food service good"}
{"text":"We came here today after spotting this place on yelp. Service, food and prices were all excellent. I recommend the brisket, the bartender also recommended we use the house hot sauce and it was amazing!!! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I have never been inside Shakers, but I have had take-out from them several times now and YOWZERS - SO YUM! 

They are first and foremost a BBQ place, though they really come off like a bar, which is why I looked right past them in the little shopping plaze they are in. I'm not exactly a bar girl, more like a nerd girl.

But they have ribs and chicken and AMAZING starters and pulled-pork sandwiches and now my mouth is watering, dangit. And they are a super friendly restaurant with a HUGE menu.

Everytime we call, the same guy picks up and cheerfully calls my Husband \"buddy,\" like they are old friends. I LOVE that. I love friendly people! But I love their food even more, so I will definitely be heading in soon to sit and enjoy my ribs instead of devouring them quickly while studying business reports, trying to keep my cat out of my cornbread. If only they were open right now...*daydreams about their ribs*"}
