{"text":"Excellent Small town dinner. Cool 50's decor and I like that they have a counter to sit at. Came on a Thursday morning, busy but no wait. Food was excellent and made to order. I had the breakfast burrito, side of hash browns and a English Muffin. Should have only ordered the Burrito, it was huge! Everything was cooked perfect and great quality. Coffee was never empty and server was friendly and fast. Defiantly will come back when in the area!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!  We were looking for a new diner for Sunday brunch and found Tootsie's.  Boy are we glad we went!!!  Not only is the food spectacular and extremely well portioned, I cannot say enough about the waitstaff.  You don't have to wait for anything!  I had corned beef hash and eggs...the corned beef hash is homemade with corned beef sliced and diced and the eggs over easy were perfect-o!!!  Coffee is refilled and they are back at your table enough to check on you.  The diner is adorable and super clean!  This is how it is supposed to be done."}
{"text":"Since my husband and I moved to Coraopolis we stumbled upon Tootsie's Diner and fell in love with the style and menu. Not to mention the people that work there-  they are awesome! We've at this point become regulars on Saturday (or Sunday if my work schedule changes). 

Depending on what time you go the pace definitely picks up and gets busy but it's worth it for a nice hot meal. I recommend if you're in the area plan to stop there and grab a bite! Say hello to Tracey our favorite waitress while you're there too! 

Oh and last but not least -- Look for their \"After Hours\" nights. A lot of the photos I've included was from their special dinner experience that they do every-so-often. It's BYOB and a smaller menu but there's choices of apps, main dish, and dessert. Mmm mmm!"}
{"text":"The service is so fast and friendly! The food is DELICIOUS! And you can't beat the price! I love this place! Will definitely come back! - Courtney M."}
{"text":"Great little diner. Everything that you would expect was on the menu, and a few specials you wouldn't (jambalya hoagie). The food was good - everything is made from scratch, the portions were large, and the service was very friendly. We will definately be back."}
{"text":"Tried Tootsies diner out for the first time and definitely will be going back. Small family owned diner with colorful scenery and comfortable seating. I had the French toast stuffed with cream cheese and my girlfriend had the same, it was delicious. Also some biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon which were very good. The service from Colleen was great and the cook did an amazing job!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this spot every single time. It's a true small diner feel. You walk in, seat yourself,  the food is exceptional. I personally love the biscuits and gravy and eggs benedict. The owner makes his rounds. It's just a friendly vibe. They remember you and treat you like they really value your business. Great local spot."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast at Tootsies.  Fantastic.  It is a nice change of pace from the mediocre breakfasts you find at most local places.  It's as though they are actually trying to make delicious food, and succeeding in spades."}
{"text":"I don't know what diner Anthony went to, but it wasn't this Tootsie's based on my visit today. I had breakfast and it was great. The bacon was perfectly done and I received a nice portion. I thought the home fries were really well prepared. I was asked if I wanted peppers and onions in the home fries and I'm glad I said yes. The eggs were as ordered. They serve a great Mancini's marble rye that was delicious (choice of at least three types of bread). My server couldn't have been nicer or friendlier. I was also greeted by the owner (Tootsie's daughter) and she was also very friendly. The staff was welcoming (some greeted by name) and friendly to the five tables around me.  This is a great diner that is a new favorite!"}
{"text":"They have the best breakfast here! Definitely recommend!! They also have had fish fry Friday's in the spring which are tremendous!!"}
{"text":"My third visit here in the past year. Always enjoy it! Had the Saddlebags - pancakes with sausage cooked in and two eggs (over easy). Put the eggs on top, add syrup, and tastes great. We sat at a table outside because it was full inside (10:00 AM on a Sunday). A little noisy with the trucks and all, but fun to be at a sidewalk cafe in Coraopolis!!  Service great, food great, a place I will be sure to come back to every time I am in the area."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice and so far I love it. This will be my go to place for breakfast whenever I have people visit and a nice place when you just need diner breakfast. With no real breakfast spots in Sewickley this is a great option right across the Sewickley bridge in Coraopolis. So good, and the staff are friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"As good as it gets is correct :) My husband and I frequent Tootsie's often. Big portions - you definitely aren't leaving hungry - and everything I've ordered here has been wonderful. Particularly love Carla's Saddlebags, which are their fluffiest pancakes stuffed with breakfast sausage. I order a side of rye toast every time and I don't even really like rye, but for some reason it's awesome here. It can get busy during peak brunch hours but tables turn pretty quickly. Coleen and Mark, the owners, work their butts off and it shows. Tootsie's is a fantastic diner."}
{"text":"Been there twice now and had a great breakfast both times. Corned beef hash is the very best I've ever had and I order it  everywhere I go. Coffee cup was never more than half empty when someone was there offering a top off. We don't go out for breakfast often but this will be our go-to when we do."}
{"text":"Breakfast was ok, not fantastic. Service was quite slow (one waitress and one cook). French toast was a bit eggy. English muffin of the eggs Benedict was a bit mushy and the hollandaise sauce was not very tasty. No orange juice, no corned beef hash and we were there early. Positive thing was that the place is very cute and clean."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic breakfast with home-cooked everything!  Absolutely delicious.  They were also very helpful when it came to my daughter's food allergies.  Much appreciated with great service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome just came here from Erie, Pa we have nothing like it and the breakfast looks so good I can't wait to enjoy it and the servers were super nice and helpful with the menu is for sure stop again and eat this awesome breakfast !!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Friendly folks.  Short hours not open evenings I don't think."}
{"text":"Tootsie's Diner has the best breakfast - hands down.  The beat the pants off any local competition.  The owner is warm and inviting, and very serious about customer service."}
{"text":"Perfect quick lunch before a client meeting. I had the cheeseburger, friends had the chicken salad sandwich and club sandwich; all were great. Cute interior design reminded me of an old 50's diner. The people were all great. Friendly, happy and helpful. Go here if you are in town.  And they have the cleanest restrooms I've ever seen in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Service here sucks. Slammed the drinks down and gave us the check immediately after the food. Meanwhile the French toast was soggy and was not cooked fully and the sausage was massively over cooked."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say.
I was hungry for a good breakfast after a long day flying with nothing to eat.
So while I waited for my bags at airport I jumped on Yelp and looked.
Up popped Tootsies and I said what the heck,it's on the way home.
Well I am so glad I did.
I guys Mark's Breakfast and when it came out I was floored on how much food there was.
3 huge pancakes,fluffy and just to die for.
The bacon was delicious and the home fries were spot on!
I went into a food coma trying to finish it and I couldn't!
I so wanted to but just couldn't,I wasn't man enough!
Great place to stop,give it a try,I was so glad I did!!!!!"}
{"text":"Got my order to go and share with another family member. Jenny Lee cinnamon french toast good but I don't know any place that serves the heel of the bread (not to mention I hate the heel!) and that piece was so tough I couldn't even cut it.  Eggs Benedict was good but really had no Hollandaise sauce because apparently what little they gave me slid under the potatoes.  Some of the thicker sliced potatoes were not cooked all the way otherwise pretty good with peppers/onions.  Stay away from the homemade donuts; very greasy and heavy - not to mention $2 each.  I'll stick to Dunkin Donuts at 99 cents for a better donut.   
A bit pricey for what you get 

Note:  No silverware or napkins for my to-go order and they should put the syrup in a souffle cup.  When I got home all the syrup was soaked into the french toast."}
{"text":"Everything is homemade   Service started slow the waiter forgot what we had ordered for drinks just coffee and water.  We had the corned beef hash and eggs it was ok nothing spectacular, service did improve after it cleared out a bit,"}
{"text":"Great place to eat good service good food good prices nice atmosphere you're coming through Corey you should definitely stop here and try it all the foods homemade"}
{"text":"Let me do this review while I still have a belly full of hamburger.  What a treat.  I was feeling a little sorry for myself, having had to open my wallet for a nice chunk of change to have some work done on my car today.  The owner of that car shop (which I will also review) was kind enough to give me a gift certificate to Tootsie's Diner to have breakfast on him.  I had already eaten breakfast, so I decided to use it to grab lunch instead.  I was encouraged by both the local endorsement and all of the positive reviews, and I'm pleased to say that my expectations were more than met.  Fast, friendly service, and great food.  I went with a bacon cheeseburger and upgraded to onion rings.  That burger was so juicy and flavorful, and as it turns out, the owner told me that he mixes the hamburger with brisket.  Wowza.  Warm, buttery brioche bun, and the good thick bacon too--not that skimpy stuff you see in pedestrian buffet lines!  Whoever described the onion rings as being like doughnuts pretty much nailed it.  They're cut very thick and must be hand battered right there at the restaurant.  Not too greasy, and served with a side of special sauce that's very similar to bloomin' onion sauce at a certain steak joint.  As I looked around, I could tell that this was a local hangout.  Families, workers on their lunch break, friends, and at least one other lone diner besides myself.  I'm going to have to try it out for breakfast or brunch sometime, because I'm sure it's on point."}
{"text":"Two blocks away! Too convenient.  I've been for breakfast and lunch. 

Really good omelet. Pretty good Reuben (too much krout). The waitress was great the first time (breakfast) but was distracted by a sales person and the owner the second time."}
{"text":"The resturant has the same vibe as the one before, still over staffed, rude, and the food was not good.

The homefries, sliced not diced, we're over seasoned with that red seasoned salt and over greased. 

The omelet was bland, the eggs had no flavor and was obviously too milky judging by the over fluff and the creamy texture.

Had to ask for jelly for toast, which only comes in white or wheat. 

Will not go back again."}
{"text":"Best diner around!  Love everything they make - must try the bacon - melts in your mouth.  The staff and owner are all very friendly.  It's better than your mommas cooking."}
{"text":"When I read Anthony's review, my jaw dropped.. I couldn't believe what I was reading! This place has awesome service, and even better food. My friends and I come here at least twice a week because we love it so much! Everything is homemade and reasonably priced. The breakfast tacos and eggs benedict are my go-to meals, but everything is good! Even if you don't live in the coraopolis/moon area, Tootsie's is definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"It's 8:00am on a Saturday morning and we drove 20 minutes to eat here!! Absolutely fantastic yumminess!! Our 8 year old and 2 year old loved it. So much food, home cooking at its finest!! And the service was unmatched. They even turned on the fryer so our 2year old could have chicken nuggets and fries. Amazing! We will be back...and often!!"}
{"text":"I don't like hotel breakfast and always venture out to a local place when I can. Walked into Tootsie's and received a warm welcome from the owner. Great menu selection. Asked about corn beef hash and was informed they smoke their own corn beef and everything is made from scratch, so that's what I ordered. The portion was HUGE. More than I would ever eat. The eggs were good and the hash was tasty and unique. People at Tootsie's are super nice."}
{"text":"Sorry to say I was very disappointed in Tootsie's.  I have had there breakfast before and it was really good.
Today was not that day, We went there about 10:00am  and we sat for 35 minutes waiting for the waitress to wait on us, didn't happen. A cook came out and got our drinks, then we were forgotten again. 
A party of three came in and a party of two and then a man came in they all got waited on before my boyfriend and me.  Very irratated at this time.  Ten minutes later she got tired of the look on my face and came over to get our order. our food arrived we waited over a hour  this is just not right. My sandwich made the bun soggy, so it didn't get eaten and some of the grilled chicken look horrible.
Will I eat there again.........maybe for breakfast.
I was a waitress for 45 years and I never did that to a customer.  Wait staff needs help."}
{"text":"Ding, Ding...order up!! This fantastic little diner is nothing short of amazing!! My boyfriend and I stopped in for breakfast this morning and we are both kicking ourselves for not getting here sooner!! There were so many great options on the menu and some fantastic specials, it was really hard to choose. You could tell anything you ordered was going to be great! We finally narrowed it down. He got the sausage and cheese omelette, complete with toast and home fries, and a side of corned beef hash (his favorite). I ordered the 2 eggs sausage and toast, complete with home fries. We also split a stuffed French toast...because how do you pass up cream cheese stuffed goodness?! The portions were perfect and so filling. Eggs were cooked to perfection, home fries delicious and well seasoned, the bread was local and soooo fresh! The hash was some of the best I've ever had, the sausage was delicious, and the coffee was amazing. There aren't even words to describe how insanely good the special French toast was. Topped with fresh berries and whipped cream...HEAVEN!!  Everything there is scratch made with love and it shows!! Our sever was a sweetheart, and very attentive. in fact, the entire staff was extremely friendly. We also got to meet one of the owners, Colleen. She was very warm and welcoming and treated us like family. In my mind this is THE diner in Coraopolis. We will DEFINITELY be going back for more!!"}
{"text":"There were so many things that made this place a five star gem! 

1. The location. On a beautiful day you can sit outside and enjoy the location and not even think twice about the prices. Can you say double winning.

2. The prices,diner food, diner prices!

3. The service. 

I decided to go with a breakfast burrito since for whatever reason I had really been craving those. Mines was ginormous! Full of flavor and served with A special salsa that really added that extra flavor I sometimes look for in breakfast foods.  


Our waitress was extremely helpful and happy to answer any questions that we had. The only issue may be parking as I didn't see any dedicated parking and if it's a week day that may be an issue as there are other local businesses that are explicit in the \"no parking here\" rule. I will definitely be back when I make way back this way!"}
{"text":"What a great place for breakfast or lunch. Everything is just like mama used to make! 
The Chicken n Waffles are fantastic and the Meatball Hoagie is served on a fresh Mancini's roll and was excellent!"}
{"text":"Found this gem on our way out of the city and what a find!  Mark is the owner and he served us himself.  We had breakfast and everything was amazing!  Blueberry pancakes were the best I've ever had!  Omelet was huge but the price was not.  Would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.  Food was good.  Outside dining was nice.  Pricing was reasonable.  Only negative was service was quite slow.  All in all a positive experience.  Me and my family will be back."}
{"text":"We were sad to see the last diner here close up shop, so needless to say when we saw Tootsies open up we had to check it out!

Atmosphere is still pretty much the same classic diner feel.  Bright, clean, and just the right touch of retro coolness.

Staff was friendly and the food delicious!

I'll be sure to try the breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Nice place. Pretty consistent with the other reviews here. I did just notice something which I consider tacky and something I hate. The waitress asked whether I wanted my home fries plain or with peppers and onions. I went for it. Later I see on my bill that they charged 50¢ extra for it!! Now that's freaking tacky. She could have said 'for an extra 50 cents\" etc. 

Again, no big deal but it's definitely tacky."}
{"text":"Super small diner but the breakfast was delish! The inside is small with a counter to sit at and only a handful of tables, definitely don't come with a large group! While we had a short wait which isn't surprising for a Saturday at brunch time, we were greeted quickly with menus. We all ordered various omelettes and the homefries with onions and peppers. Everyone was happy with the meal! While the food and service were a a bit slow, we couldn't complain since there was only one waitress busting her butt for the whole place! If you are in the area, you won't be disappointed.  Sandwiches looked good too, so I'd be curious to come back for lunch!"}
{"text":"Good fast service for a Sunday, corned beef hash not as fresh as advertised still tasted good"}
{"text":"This has become my go-to breakfast spot.  Tootsie's is a really cute place, very clean, with lots of vintage items around.  It is a small restaurant, 9 tables, I believe, and a few counter stools.  Parking is on the street, but never a problem.  Waitstaff are very friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient.  The owners, brother and sister are nearly always around, pitch in when needed, and are very likeable.  Now...the food...is WONDERFUL!!  Everything is well-presented, hot and fresh.  This place makes the best pancakes I have EVER had--fluffy, tender, and just delicious.  Everyone there knows me now, and they remember how I like things, which is nice.  I tend to be VERY particular, and they are patient with me...they have yet to call me a pain in the ass.  To my face, in any event!  Thus far, I've had breakfast on every visit, bit I've seen a lot of lunch items go by, and they all look and smell great.  Come here.  Really, you'll be happy!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to be able to give this place a super good review. The place was adorable and had a great atmosphere, especially if you like that diner feel. The coffee was great but never got refilled and the one waitress made you feel uncomfortable because It seemed like she didn't want to be there. I felt like she slammed the food and drinks on the table. If it weren't for feeling like a burden, I would have given it a higher rating. Hash browns were good but French toast was cold."}
{"text":"Great little diner. Super clean.  Friendliest staff, even at the  the end of the day!  Mark, the owner, even came out and asked my kids what music they liked for the jukebox since it was quiet near closing time. Excellent Reuben and sandwiches.  Need to come back for breakfast, looked great."}
{"text":"We had a delicious breakfast at Tootsie's. The service was friendly and efficient and the menu has great options for everyone. The decor is cute and it's very clean. My only complaint is that the prices did seem a bit high for breakfast. I have tried several different places in the area and Tootsie's has been the best."}
{"text":"Oh, what a treat - diet be damned!! A very quaint diner with a fantastic burger and fries. This no frills burger hit the spot.  No special sauce or assortment of misplaced slippery toppings.  Just lettuce, onion and tomato - and one of the best buns I have had in a long time!  I am now at peace :)"}
{"text":"Bang for your buck: 7/10
Quality: 8/10
Service: 9/10
Ambiance/Location: 9/10
Overall: 9/10

Great service! Get the pancakes!"}
{"text":"First time. Had marks monster. Amazing. Eggs were solid. The meats were incredible. Asked for potatoes to be well done and they actually came out well done. Pancakes were fluffy and delicious. And the service was fantastic. Were only ones there when we arrived. Place was filled at 10 when we left. Would definitely recommend and will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I was in the area for unrelated reasons and stopped here spontaneously. This is definitely some of the best diner food I've had. They don't seem to freeze ingredients, it's tastes fresh, and you can definitely notice the difference. Also, Maggie, the server was incredibly nice. If I'm in the area or passing through definitely will be stopping back, and recommend you do too."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, classic feel and fantabulous menu items. Tootsie's Diner is now the best establishment I have ever stepped foot in! Their home fries are the bomb, and their waitresses treat you as if you own a Bentley! Tootsie's, thank you for putting a smile on my face."}
{"text":"This diner is so cute. Makes you really feel like you are in a family owned restaurant. I ordered Stefanos Sampler to try a little bit of everything on the breakfast menu. It was delicious. They advertise hand made and that is exactly what it tasted like. Tasted like there was a lot of love and effort put into the food. The meat was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I don't normally eat pancakes but their pancake was excellent."}
{"text":"The waitress was not very nice.  My wife had French toast with berries, but the berries were frozen.  I had the eggs Benedict and the eggs and hollandaise were cold.

I won't go there again."}
{"text":"Just amazing place all around I will definetly  call you again. Customer service is by far the best I have seen."}
{"text":"Excellent food and wait staff! My wife and I had Sunday breakfast there and we will definitely go back again. I had the breakfast sampler and she had the breakfast quesadilla with chorizo. Both dishes you can tell were homemade with quality ingredients. One of the best quesadillas we have ever eaten even after living in Phoenix for 2 years being surrounded by excellent Mexican food. We also loved the diner ambiance and color scheme that brought a smile to our daughters face."}
{"text":"There was a long wait, but the waitress was nice and even though they only had one pot of coffee for the whole restaurant she kept our cups filled. I got the western omelet and asked for Swiss cheese, but it came with American. I was too hungry to wait so I ate it anyway. It was good... not flat like a pancake but pretty thick. Would recommend their omelets for sure. And you can't beat Mancini bread.

Unfortunately they didn't have cinnamon toast, which my wife loves. They had poached eggs (wife loves), but were out of fruit (not seasonal). The waitress was nice and cut her up a banana anyway (like a little baby)."}
{"text":"As one that worships the Reuben (which I absolutely do), you will be hard pressed to find a better option in the Moon area. I have tried pretty much every possible location in the are and some are well known for their Reuben`s but Tootsies is the meatiest / tastiest I have yet to encounter. I accompanied the Reuben with a side of onion rings which also were top notch and the size of donuts. The onion rings were served with a blooming onion type sauce."}
{"text":"There are few foods that I choose to eat, this restaurant has broadened my horizons and furthered my knowledge of possibility
                  -Aaron Male
Me and my family enjoyed the multitude of flavor we tasted from the delicious buttermilk pancakes to the omelet that was \"very good\" - My grandmother. We enjoyed the thought of a local business being so great we would wish it to be back with us in our hometown

This business and food was great, you should come, don't forget to support a local business."}
{"text":"A classic diner that draws regular customers. Very friendly and attentive. Portions are big! I got the burrito that was delicious. Like how they use local products like Mancini's bread and Marburger dairy."}
