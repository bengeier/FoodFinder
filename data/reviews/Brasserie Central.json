{"text":"This is a great neighbourhood restaurant. The staff is super friendly. The food is excellent! I've eaten at Central many times and I have never had a bad experience. Try the Gazpacho this summer. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Westmount is the Beverly Hills of Montreal and our Brasserie meal with mussels, duck confit, lobster risotto and prosciutto with Parmesan has been delightful. Having fun in Montreal"}
{"text":"It is a cozy restaurant with a very Westmount crowd but the food is below expectations and a bit pretentious. The seafood soup I buy in IGA is much tastier. I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Good food but terrible service! They are nice but We waited more than 45 minutes for food. I didn't order something complicated, I ordered their hamburger. Terrible wait so I would not come here again!"}
{"text":"J'adore cette nouvelle place"}
{"text":"Great food, great ambiance, feel you are in Europe. Had the ozzu boccu was to die for!!"}
{"text":"Great service at the bar. We were 3 girls who had a delicious ginger red sangria and loved the appetizers shrimp and cod fritters. Great fries too. The Resto owner could have been a little more customer friendly and greet us more warmly."}
{"text":"Petit bistro local un peu plus élégant que la moyenne des commerces et restaurants l'entourant mais d'une simplicité volontaire et d'un charme intelligent qui l'éloigne de toute prétention. J'ai commandé la salade d'endive, les pétoncles saisies et quelques tranches de l'incontournable jambon Serrano qui trône d'ailleurs fièrement au milieu de la salle à diner, prêt à se faire découper et servi avec du parmesan fraichement râpé et une huile de truffe et miel; un véritable régal. La salade d'endive au citron qui comprenait aussi des morceaux de pamplemousse et des pacanes caramélisées fut toutefois mon coup de coeur. On parle ici d'un équilibre fin et habile entre les différentes saveurs sucrées ou amères sans pour autant les compromettre individuellement. La portion des palourdes était un peu petite malgré son statut d'entrée. Tout aussi délicieux par contre et une cuisson particulièrement réussie.  
Le service était agréable et le vin qui nous a été recommandé accompagnait en effet très bien les diverses entrées que nous avions commandées."}
{"text":"I just had brunch here.  Excelelent. Lot's of brilliance in this rarity in Westmount.  The brunch menu was so interesting and the dishes were delicious.  

GOOD:  This place has a lot of good things. 
1.  Coffee-great cup of espresso.  Clean and elegant.  
2.  Eggs with truffles and braised beef-this was excellent.  The presentation was wonderful-in a mason jar-and the eggs and braise were perfect (could have been more salt-but oh well).  
3.  Pain perdu-wonderfully made with brioche.  Light and delightful.  Perhaps could have put the caramel and yogurt off to the side. 
4.  Bacon-this is probably the best bacon of any restaurant in the city-better than Maison Publique (they cure it themselves) and Lawrence.  
5.  Service-incredible and friendly.  They let me in 15 minutes before opening time-no snooty rule fascists here. 
6. jambon serrano-incredible qualiyt serrano with a great machine.  This serrano was better than the Iberico Bellata that I have had here in Montreal.  The machine was amazing. 
7,  Eggs for children-they made a children's egg dish for my daughter, she loved it.  They only charged $5 for a \"children's meal\".
8.  Price was great for this quality of food-$12-15 per dish.
9.  Bread was free (unlike Ritz's new Daniel Boloud restaurant).  
10.  Homemade rhubarb orange jam.
11.  Great butter.  (Salted-though I like sweet butter better)
12.  Presentation-great.
13.  Ambiance-great.
14.  Service-fabuolous.  NO angry people here.  What's with Westmount?  They need some angry people to ignore you.  

NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:
1.  Baking-the baked goods have a ways to go. Chocolate cake and madeleines are not yet there. (The homemade bread, however, was very very good).  
2.  One cup of coffee was so-so.  According to the waiter, it was a different coffee person for the first cup vs. second. 

RETURN:  Absolutely.  I want to try the buckwheat pancake dishes which looked compelling. 

MENU:  I would have liked to see the dinner menu be a little less Canadianized (at least in the naming of their dishes).  But I am not running a business, just eating.  Even so-I am pretty confident that Thierry's amazing talent will shape things beautifully, and I look forward to trying the dinner menu.  

REVIEW IN GAZETTE:  Strange and questionable.  Whe was trained in France and got kind of irritable that it wasn't a classic Brasserie with sauerkraut, sausage and mounds of seafood.  And she compared it to four of the best brasseries in Paris.   But if you look at her other reviews on French restos-she doesn't hold them to Parisian standards (they wouldn't be close).   

And she doesn't get snooty about divergence elsewhere.  She reviewed some Japanese restaurants that seem pretty Canadianized (all but 1) which to me don't have much semblance to japanese food (the exception was Jun-i which has a lot of great things going for it).      

Maybe she ordered the wrong things; she ordered spaghetti in a French Brassirie-enough said? 

She was snooty about \"too much truffle oil\".  Us non-snooty (I am pretty snooty) eaters LOVE truffle oil.  I can't afford real truffles, and I love the next best thing.   A person who loves \"Japanese\" restaurants (owned by Vietnameses) that serve \"California Rolls\" should not get all uppity about truffles.  I get irritated by overly snobby reviewers.  But I get more irritated when they don't know anything about some of the foods they review. (She obviously knows French cuisine and has the training and background to review it.)  But I think maybe her pickiness was in overdrive.  But who knows, new restaurants have kinks to work out."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to enjoying the tapas that was described by previous diners. Overall, my husband and I were underwhelmed. The clams and shrimp were very good, the fig with cheese, cod cakes were good but the duck legs we found bland and greasy. There is no salt or pepper on the table probably because the food is already quite salty.  What was most disappointing was the service. It took a while before our drink orders were taken, then too long before they were brought to the table.  We were never asked if we wished another drink, an opportunity lost.  Too many excellent restos in Montreal - at this price point, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Brasserie Central is a modern twist to a French bistro. Yet, not as pleasing to the palette as a French bistro should be. 
Upon our arrival for brunch at 10:30am on a Saturday morning, we noticed we were the only table. A bit surprising! 
We sat down and had a lovely waitress. Kind, polite and did her job well. Our drinks(Coffee and hot chocolate) took 15 minutes to arrive. Disappointing considering how easy they are to make. 
My hot chocolate was very poorly made, it tasted like nothing but a warm(not hot) cup of hot milk with a dash of cocoa. Or perhaps it was instant? Either way, I made a comment to them, and they made me another one. Not one bit of a difference from the first one. I got over it, but still not impressed.
While waiting for our breakfast, we noticed the chef/owner sending his assistant to purchase the raisin bread for my french toast. Shouldn't you have this by now?? 
Twenty minutes later, our beautifully presented meals arrived. Truly great presentation with the plates and decorations. Unfortunately the plates and decorations stood out far more than the food. 
Our meals were just \"OK\" they were served not too warm and lacked taste, but not salt. My raisin french toasted tasted dry, and very sweet. 
The eggs were well done, good! Considering how simple it is to cook eggs. The Hollaindaise sauce was saucy and yellow, but not taste at all. What happened to the hint of lemon juice? Paprika? All these ingredients are always part of a Hollaindaise sauce.

Overall, I know this restaurant is doing quite well and has been in Westmount for a few years now. Perhaps we simply had bad luck? Or it was a bad day. 
If and when I decide to return, I would think twice about it."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. It's a decent bistro with good wine and food. But I find their cocktails are not well made. So stick to wine if you want a drink. 

I really like their burger but found their tartare dull. The service quality  can vary depending on the night. Some times it's been great, other times brusque. It's pricier than what I'd expect for the quality of food, but it's in Westmount which may explain why."}
{"text":"We went there for brunch. The menu is small, which usually I don't like, but there it wasn't a problem, because the options were all great! I had the omelette and regretted it, it was nothing special. Then we shared this amazingly looking raspberry french toast, which did not taste quite as great as it looked, but still was a very good choice. Service was very good. I just felt the food was very promising, but ended up being not very remarkable."}
{"text":"Very talented chef; friendly service; charming atmosphere; a jewel in Westmount area..."}
{"text":"Laying in bed one night, the bf and I were watching a Montreal food show that was showcasing a restaurant that looked, for a lack of a better description, really really good. We slowly realized, \"hey, that resto is actually in our 'hood\" Rejoice! Great restos in Westmount are few and far between so it was a pretty exciting discovery. 

11am on Saturday we showed up ready for our weekend brunch. The place was fairly empty yet we were nonetheless excited and struck by the simplicity and modern elegance of the golden themed decor. The menu was fairly limited (6-7 items), I chose the pancakes and he the omelette. I ordered a side of bacon and was pretty happy about that as it was thick and crispy, yet juicy. Our dishes were small in portion yet well garnished, fresh, and well-made with quality ingredients. Service was good and we will be sure to come back again and again."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch with friends.  Reservations are suggested, as they are quite busy on weekends.  It's got a nice French bistro decor going on, with a fun lively atmosphere.  Service was very good.  Prices are a little in the high side but not exorbitant.  I had the goat cheese and mushroom omelette which was very nice and came with a side of toast and home fries which were very tasty.  My daughter and husband had the French toast which they both said was good but \"too chocolate-y\".  Like that's possible??? They even made a little bowl of scrambled eggs for our baby.  Note: there were a lot of babies and small kids here.  They were all well behaved and the noise level was reasonable.  This may be a good thing or not, depending on your perspective!  For us, with little ones, it's a great family friendly brunch option with sophisticated menu options for the grown ups."}
{"text":"The crab cakes were great. We went for brunch and the menu was small but very intricate and absolutely delicious. It's a very elegant place and in the Westmount area with good boutique stores. It's a nice place for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Brasserie, quite self-explanatory, French ambiance with a relaxed setting. Went there for brunch on a Sunday morning. The place is very family oriented. In fact, the time I visited I actually saw more families with kids than couples. The egg benedict is on fleek if that's what you're actually wondering :P"}
{"text":"Brasserie Central is like a fancy French pub. Nice decor (wood, brick, pipes and mirrors), with a table of fresh baguettes in the middle of the restaurant. I dropped by for lunch this summer and though they were pretty firm about opening at 11am, we were able to pick our table when we physically went by the make our reservation. It got quite busy shortly after we were seated.

The menu is on the short side but has interesting twists to classics. They also have a lunch table d'hôte that seemed like a great deal but wasn't quite what I wanted. There is a focus on seafood which was nice to see. I love getting bread baskets in Montreal - the baguette slices we were given had just the most lovely chew. I ended up getting the spicy lobster roll and swapped out my fries for a green salad. The 'roll' ended up being two slices of dark rye/pumpernickel bread which was nice. There were large chunks of lobster along with avocado slices, sprouts, and some crunchy bacon slices. It wasn't very spicy at all though. The salad was simply dressed in an oil-vinegar vinaigrette. 

Service was good, food was decent. I will probably come back."}
{"text":"Small restaurant on Sherbrooke st. In Westmount. The place is very loud. The decor is nice and trendy, the have a nice terrace. Food wise they have 1 item in the table d hote...and the rest of the menu is very limited in terms of choice. I tried the lobster roll, it was good just a bit too lemony.... the fries were good ."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Ritz Carlton, and am a fan of Boloud's work in NYC, so we figured we'd stop by.

Dinner tasting menu was fantastic, and very reasonably priced compared to where we're from. A place like this would be far more difficult to get reservations at in New York City.

Liked it enough to come back for the lunch tasting menu during our trip. Again, outstanding.

Garden and ambiance was beautiful."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this place! I study in Mariano and close to this restaurant. The manager was so patient. I ordered butternut squash soup with coconut milk. It was fabulous. The crab cake was fantastic. Since I was alone and with small appetite. I couldn't order a main anymore. For dessert, there were chocolate pot mousse and pudding cake with hot caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. Heard pudding cake would come in big portion so I chose chocolate mousse. The mousse was average. Definitely going to come back and try the jampon and the dessert!"}
{"text":"If you're with a group of girl friends in the Westmount / NDG area and you want to sit outside and have cocktails and bites that are delicious and pretty what are your options really? Brasserie Central is what we came up with, and we weren't disappointed. 

The duck drumsticks were fingerlicking lipsmackingly delicious, crispy and saucy and super good. The Aperol Spritzer was a big glass of alright. The white sangria was too sweet for my taste, and the service was a little spotty forgetting things here and there, but generally kind and friendly. The room is nice looking, the patio is sunny with a roll down shade when you need it. Lots and lots to appreciate."}
{"text":"Brunch on a rainy Sunday. Interior is nice. Service was excellent. Coffee- Meh. Our entrees looked nice- they appeared to be made with all fresh ingredients with good technique, but the flavors were disappointing. How could something that looks so carefully prepared be so uninteresting in the mouth? I mentioned to the waitress that my buckwheat crepe (which was cooked perfectly) was cold inside (I don't think they warmed up the ham in any way before filling) she kindly comped our coffees. I only ate part of my breakfast because I just got bored about 1/3 of the way through.  I would go back in hopes that the other dishes would have a more more interesting balanced flavors."}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out, as menu seemed awesome, and located in a place without this type of offering. But we went on a Saturday at 3:30pm, and the kitchen was closed, which we found kinda weird. I guess we should've checked first, but still strange a bit we thought.

So, we wanted to sit outside (lovely seating in the sunny breeze) then to just have cocktails, but apparently Westmount law doesn't allow you unless you get food, despite a closed kitchen, but one thing was on offer: slices of ham from a large ham that was sitting in the middle of the warm room with one or two flies buzzing about it (no joke). 

Anyway, we decided no ham, and sat inside then. We asked for a cocktail menu, but were told there was no cocktail menu, so we just ordered two Bloody Caesars. They tasted unbelievably good, but there was hardly enough vodka in them (couldn't taste it at all/no buzz from the drinks at all). We decided to just leave after finishing them and headed to Burgundy Lion, on the way out, we noticed over a dozen little cocktail menus standing on a little tray by the door and menus, and thought it was weird that we were told there was none.

Cute little place, but we felt very underwhelmed due to a slight pretentiousness it carries, and the general feeling we got from the clientele. It caters very much to the wealth of the area rather than objective quality. Service was friendly, but that seemed more fueled by comfort of high tipping clientele rather than genuine care.

We probably had a uniquely off experience, but I doubt I'd want to return anyhow. Westmount can feel weird and elitist and cutoff from society in general, and this place embodies that feeling."}
{"text":"Although my food was pretty decent. The service was horrible. My friend and I went there for lunch around 1 on a Friday. She ordered a glass of wine and the turkey club. The waitress said that there was no more turkey already! She also said they had no more if that type of wine for lunch hour. That they were keeping all the wine for the dinner menu?! 
I've never heard of this before?! 

My friend had to take the burger and got charged for extra cheese and bacon. 

I took the salmon which was good but considering the service we won't be going back! 

Also, don't expect to have oysters for lunch it's only on their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with 2 girlfriends and it was horrible! My friend said that her carrot soup was the worst she had ever tasted. Her main was risotto, and I could tell in a second that they had not used the correct rice. Her bowl had rice floating in broth, and she said it was terrible. I ordered the lobster sandwich ($17) and it looked and felt amazing. The bun was toasted and crunchy with butter, but one bite of it told me that the lobster salad was tasteless. honestly, I could hardly even taste a fishy taste.
I don't get this place. The food. Terrible, but people keep going there. Go somewhere that actually makes edible food!"}
{"text":"Original brunch menu with many different seafood options in addition to the usual eggs and ham fare: eggs Benedict with lobster, crab cake or smoked trout. Their potatoes are seasoned and tasty. Juice is made fresh.

Reasonable prices, clean place with lots of natural lighting in daytime and friendly staff."}
{"text":"A lovely little gem in the heart of Westmount with a wonderful staff and a simply menu.

K and I went to try their new \"tapas menu\" and let me tell you, we weren't disappointed.

Round one: white wine and garlic Mussels and hot wings. The former, simple and straight to the point, offered a pungent garlicky journey. The latter, modest in appearance, brought some serious pimentón kick. Marinated, breaded and glazed with the same assortment of spices (read paprika to the power of three), the chicken wings were delectably sweet and spicy both in their tenderness and crunchiness.  

Round two: Baked oysters with chorizo & Queso Fresco, and the Gambas, which you will guess by their color, also a la pimentón ;). Juicy, with a crunchy pop, the Gambas were colossal. And so were the oysters. They delivered on their promise: a firm and slippery texture drenched in a creamy sea of fatty spicy chorizo bites and fresh cheese.

For dessert? The house's Sticky Toffee Pudding and the other new creation of the day, le cream pie. K took over the Pudding and its ice cream despite being lactose intolerant (that's how good it was), but I think the pie is by far the dessert that won it all. Made with white chocolate and bananas on a bed of crumbled biscuits and walnuts - the custard cream was decadently light and fluffy. 

All in all, a wonderful bistro where to meet an old friend."}
{"text":"The ossobuco here made me forget that Revenue Quebec exists. It's that good. And I make damn good ossobuco, so this is a big deal coming from me. It was served on this barley risotto that was also to die for. I am literally salivating as I write this. 

When they first opened, I thought the food was hit or miss, but in the past year the food here has been delicious. I've eaten here about 6 times in the past 12 months and literally everything I've had from their prosciutto to salads to dessert has been perfect.

The service is great. The waiters are on their A-game and Paolo, the owner, is not just amazing with food and wine suggestions but can also do Elvis impersonations (you'll only see this if you are really really lucky).

The decor is simple and beautiful and the vibe is like a classic French bistro but more friendly.  It's definitely the best restaurant of it's kind in Westmount and I'd even venture to say that it's seriously up there for spots west of St-Laurent. Plus they are open until midnight every night (even Mondays) so it's an awesome place to go to for later eats.

So yeah, you should eat here. It's delicious and fun and lovely and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Eggs benedict done differently from what I'm accustomed to, but pulled off so, so well. I ordered the benedictine: 2 poached eggs, hollandaise, shredded ham, on BRIOCHE. Flavours complemented one another and was the perfect portion size. Size potatoes could have been crispier but were seasoned well! Service was very attentive.. It was a hot day and my water was refilled nonstop! And the atmosphere was wonderful. My girlfriend got the lobster eggs benny and she loved it as well. good stuff.. or should I say... BON PRODUIT.."}
{"text":"i could have been dining in ny or sf.  well, with french subtitles anyway.

my parents used to frequent mess hall as they live right around the corner.  with the new swanky digs, brasserie central shows lots of promise.

warm lighting and sienna toned indian artwork, the food is tdf.

uber cute tin buckets for uber cute teeny seed buns. i never eat bread or rather rarely eat bread but i just had to try it.  it was too cute!

menus on clipboards in either french or english...our table was super boring with 3 orders of the special of the day.  it was a divine pork medallions on a bed of caramelized onions with a puree of celery.  my parents didn't care for the celery but i scraped it off like a scavenger.  who does pork medium rare?  well brasserie central does!  we paired it with a pinot noir from new zealand.  

owned by a highly regarded chef teamed up with an impressive pastry one, we had to sample a dessert.  i asked for a house specialty and was given a layered parisian pastry with salted caramel butter and buttermilk sorbet. dee-lish.  

a wee tough on the wallet but central is worth the splurge.

men do come dine as i witnessed quite the number of ladies partaking in a culinary voyage.  our friend who was the chef at l'express told us to check this place out, if that isn't a ringing endorsement, i don't know what is!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere , jazz sweet music, dim ligth, good service, many tables, you can take a drink after 5:30pm."}
