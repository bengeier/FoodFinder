{"text":"Ok so this place is no good in my opinion, would give zero stars if I could.  decided to try em out and ordered delivery a while back and when the food was delivered it was cold with hardly any cheese on the pizza, You could clearly see the bread throughout the whole pie. the wings were also cold. And to top it off the salad was soggy and seemed past it's useful date. Pretty much threw out most of the food because it didn't taste good anyway. Didn't even taste the salad for fear of food poisoning. For pretty hefty prices I was definitely expecting better. Big jimmy's is way better for half the price. I felt like I was ripped off. called them, talked to a staff member she assured me a manager would call. Long story short I called and called and never received a call back. Always just an excuse. \"I'm not authorized to issue a full or even partial refund, you'll have to wait for a manager to call you\" I must have tried 5 or 6 times. I wouldn't spend your money here. Pretty bad when you get beat by $5 pizza. what disappointed me the most was their lack of concern for a paying customer. A customer who has spent lots of money and used to regularly visit philly's bar and grill, which they are affiliated with."}
{"text":"They were fast on their delivery;  however,  they sent me the wrong cheesesteak.  I called them up and they resent the correct cheesesteak in a timely manner.  To be honest,  do not think I will reorder from them again--not because of the mix-up, but because I was not pleased with the food (cheesesteak bread was soggy)."}
{"text":"Spacolis is ok pizza. I ordered bread sticks and a pizza. Ill give it to them that the flavor's of the pizza and bread sticks were very good. But the pizza was under cooked and so were the bread sticks. Not that it was doughy or anything just that the crust on the pizza and the bread sticks were still very white and not golden brown. The cheese on the pizza was all so not browned like how you would expect cheese to be on a pizza. I will give them another try and i will be asking to have everything cooked just a little longer."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS PIZZA WINGS & CHEESE STEAKS!!! This place is awesome, great food and atmosphere. Convenient location for MCC students to grab lunch. They also deliver so they're perfect for take out night or game day munchies. Best pizza and specials in town! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Got a groupon for this place so decided to try it out last night when we didn't know what else to do with ourselves. We decided on the 18 inch veggie pizza, cheese bread, and garlic fries. They don't deliver to our location so we decided to call ahead to pick up. 

The girl who answered the phone sounded really annoyed that we were calling to order from here. She sighed after every item I told her. *Sigh* \"Is that all?\" Umm... yes. Because if I order one more thing I think you might start to cry. Anyways, she told us it would be ready in 25 minutes. So 25 minutes later we drive down there, only to find out that they haven't started on the cheese bread, or the fries. Really? We gave you almost half an hour and you didn't even start part of our order. So we had to stand around for an extra 5 minutes, clearly annoyed. So they finally bring everything out and we pay. The cheese bread looked anemic. No brown on it whatsoever. Which is clearly from the fact that they started it as soon as we walked in the door and pulled it out as fast as possible so we wouldn't have to wait any longer. The fries were good, nice and hot and didn't have that really spicy flavor of garlic when too much is used. The pizza was also good. A little on the cold side, like that had been finished and sitting out for at least 5 minutes before we got there. But it was a good size with a good amount of veggies.

I will give this place another chance just because the prices are decent, and while I had to wait longer than necessary, everything tasted pretty good."}
{"text":"Very good pizza place, never been disapointed yet, the wings can be hit or miss, but mostly hit."}
{"text":"Got delivery and it took about 40 minutes to get to me but it was well worth the wait! My calzone was amazing! Definitely will be ordering here again!:)"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Spacolis since they opened thier doors last year. In the first few months this place rocked, maybe because they were new....  . It has since declined greatly. Slowly the quality of food as well as customer service began to dwindle. I was served a hot slice with frozen toppings for example. It seems with each new employee, they care less and less about the customer. I think they rely on the college across the street for repeat business instead of offering great service. The last time I dined there, I watched  an employee break many healthcode violations like eating in the kitchen and not washing hands.... ick."}
{"text":"The deluxe pizza is amazing! Its full of flavor. We get it all the time for work, and enjoy every single bite. If you have any left over, I would recommend warming it in the oven, not the microwave. 

The employees are always happy to help and delivery is super fast."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight. Almost 6 yr old son gave a big thumbs up for the pizza. We also had wings which my hubby said were very good and I also liked. The house salad and dressing were good. Owners couldn't be nicer ~ came out and talked with us after we finished to make sure everything was ok and see how everything was. Want to try the cheesecake next time.

We will definitely be back. Great prices on everything."}
{"text":"Best prizza! All the toppings are delicious I've had the pineapple and Canadian bacon pizza and the sausage and onion pizza. Also the special wings are on point OMG.  I'd suggest getting the pizza well done, it's a lot tastier and the crust is a good crunch."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Over 2 hour wait for pizza and then we're told the driver was making 5 runs and ours was last even though we literally live 4 minutes away. So if the pizza shows up cold then they'll \"fix the situation\", I'm assuming making us wait another 2 hours for pizza.. No thanks. First and last time I'll be going here.

Update: pizza showed up extremely cold and had to be reheated in the oven."}
{"text":"Greasy, full of oil, and overpriced.  That's a nutshell of what Spacoli's awaits for you.  With Grimaldi type of pricing, I was expecting much better.  Instead, this is below Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"A mixed bag. We really liked the sauce and pepperoni, but the cheese was obviously part skim (waxy, no chew) which is a dealbreaker for me. There's an option for whole milk mozzarella in the ordering process, but if it's not something they use regularly, how fresh will it be?

Crust was odd, almost like non-yeast crust (soft, not much chew), and the bottom was coated with crunchy black specks that appeared to be burnt cornmeal, as if nobody swept out the oven before putting our pizza in. That black grit was dealbreaker #2.

To pick it up I had to go to the back of the bar at Philly's. Pickup process was chaotic--app said \"10-30 minutes\" and then updated it to about 50 minutes--that was eight minutes in, when I was already pulling into the parking lot. I went and killed some time at Food City across the street. I came back about ten minutes before the specified time, to suddenly get a notification that my order was ready. It had been sitting there a couple minutes, apparently."}
{"text":"My groupon was about to expire so I ordered take out today. I ordered the Spacoli's original cheesesteak with garlic fries and an 18 inch pizza with pepperoni and jalapenos. They told me it would be about 30 minutes when I placed my order but it ended up taking about 45 minutes so I waited for a bit in the restaurant. The service was great - they offered me a small glass for a drink while I waited for my food. The total ended up being around 50 cents because I was using a groupon. The person who rang me up (I'm guessing an owner) didn't charge me since the total was so small.

The cheesesteak was flavorful and cheesy, they did not skimp on the whiz. The roll was soft and fresh. The garlic fries were tasty but soggy so I would ask  for them extra crispy next time. The pizza was definitely worth ordering again. The crust was handtossed so thin but not too thin. The crust was soft and the sauce was savory. The 18 inch pizza was cut into 8 huge slices. All in all you get a lot of good quality food for your money."}
{"text":"Seriously bad!  No flavor to the pizza at all.  Tasted like the sauce was made from ketchup.  Wings were OK at best and they forgot the ranch for our salad with delivery.  Would not recommend.  Spend your hard earned money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Very very disappointed. It was movie night at my neighbors place and we decided on pizza. My friends had told me that this was the best place to get pizza so how to give it a try.
First, the pizza took more than hour to get to us. We were pretty starving by that point. Second, the pizza was cold when we got the box... What a miserable fail. I just ate it because I was so hungry, but after this experience, I'll probably go somewhere else as my first call for delivery pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken bacon ranch pizza.  Got home, no bacon... Pizza was overall still good."}
{"text":"Man these people have good pizza.  Just went and got a sausage, olive and onion pizza and it was killer.  A little expensive, but it was so worth it.  And they deliver too.  I'm serious, try it."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing, as are the breadsticks. I just hate going in this place because it's frequently crowded with people. But hey, that's a personal preference. If you like food, GOOD food, definitely go here, but it's certainly not a quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"A very solid place.  Professional, good pizza, good prices, quick delivery.  Not outstanding, but just a good pizza at a good price.  The best in the area for delivery."}
{"text":"Okay, so I ordered a simply 14\" thin crust pizza and an order of mozzarella sticks for my kids. 95 min later, still no order. ? After almost 2 hours the pizza and mozzarella sticks arrived ice cold. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Very unsatisfactory.  After traveling all day to get to my hotel, I decided on pizza...what can go wrong, right?  I ordered delivery of the 14\" deluxe and a 2 liter of diet Pepsi, my total was $21.27, and took about 35-40 min to get to me which was fine.  The smell was amazing...at first.  I thanked the delivery guy, added a tip and off he went.  I went in and washed my hands to get ready to dig in and that was the end of the good experience.  My first bite told me that the crust was a little burnt, I figured well, it's probably a brick oven pizza and it got a little hot on one side...NOT the case...the crust was completely burnt.  I know I could have called and complained, but I was starving from being in the travel mode all day, so I basically ate all the topping (which was pretty good).

I don't think I will risk another $20+ on this one."}
{"text":"First time ordering pizza at our new house and I look for reviews all the time. This place in particular had good enough ratings so I scroll through the pictures and I come across a good looking pizza. I order a half and half, pineapple on one side and pepperoni on the other. With high expectations, I was very disappointed. 

Clearly not enough pineapple on the pizza. Maybe they believe pineapple doesn't belong on pizza, but come on."}
{"text":"Awesome experience. Fabulous food delivered to our hotel room. Courteous delivery.  Ceasar salad was so good, wings perfect, pizza tasty,philly cheese steak surpassing expectations."}
{"text":"New to town and in the mood for pizza so I decided to give Spacoli's a try.  Designed my own pizza with some meat and spinach and had it delivered. Arrival time was quick and pizza was excellent. Will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Nothing better that a Stone Oven Pizza!
Had customized \"Meat Lovers Pizza\" Pepperoni,sausage, mushrooms and green bell pepper. Honey/Hot chicken wings that are really taste and meaty. Delivery Service option is outstanding:"}
{"text":"Got delivery tonight. I had an Oder of wings in their house sauce and a pepperoni calzone. Delivery was fast, friendly, and arrived hot. The wings were awesome. Their house sauce is def homemade seemed to have some garlic in it. Hot enough to not be boring but not so hot you can't taste anything. They were meaty too! Oh and the side of ranch they give us tasty and more than big enough to dip every bite in it. I'll def be getting wings from them again. My calzone was good, made with real cheese, and properly cooked. It was also big more than enough for two. Good food, good prices, and they deliver. I will def be seeing them again and a again."}
{"text":"This place is solid. I've ordered from them several times and its been good each time. Far better than the \"chains\" and with the extra couple of bucks.

Calzones are excellent, the sauce is good and the dough they use seems to be fresh. Pizzas are pretty yummy too...Nothing to rant and rave about but definitely a nice change when you want a specialty pie. Wings and cheesy bread are great as well.

I wouldn't hesitate to order from them."}
{"text":"I'd order from here again. Just make sure you order the specials because doing otherwise, cost way too much for regular pizzas. I ordered a white pizza and meat lovers. Both tasted good but I'll admit they screwed up my order. Being that I paid $30 for a small and medium pizza, I expect to get what I pay for - this ous why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza, and FREE DELIVERY. Sorry chain pizza places, I have finally found a legit replacement. Best deal is their 18\" giant cheese pizza for 9.99 every day."}
{"text":"Address does not exist.  Apparently it is inside the bar.  Not sure if it is still in business."}
{"text":"Huge Portions!
Sweet Potato are awesome! Food was very tasty & hot!
Ordered online & was delivery promptly!"}
{"text":"Pizza is always great.  They put plenty of cheese and veggies on the pizza.  Only place I order from.  And John is always super friendly.  Drivers are prompt too."}
{"text":"Spacoli's pizza was anything but a disappointment. I ordered through the Yelp app, which was incredibly easy, and our pizza showed up hot with delicious fresh toppings, and a crust that was perfectly crisp outside and soft on the inside. We got the large meat lovers (add jalapeños) and it was enough for two adults, with 2 slices left over. Spacoli's is officially on our pizza list!"}
{"text":"I would recommend Spacolis Pizza 100% to anyone!!! I recently moved to Arizona and had a flyer on my door for this local pizza place. The prices were much better than the big national chains and I wanted to see what my neighborhood had to offer. When calling in for a delivery order, I spoke to Barry, who apparently is one of the owners. Either way he was extreamly helpful, suggestive and very friendly! The price was right but the quality exceeded the cost by far! The delivery time was quick, the food was hot, it looked amazing and all the accoutrements were included without having to even ask, i.e. red peppers, parm cheese, napkins, even paper plates. And might I add that the ranch dressing is out of this world!!! I had a wonderfuly amazing experience with Spacolis and will continue to order from them as well as suggest them to everyone I know the area!"}
{"text":"Okay so I'm going to be honest, we are from out of town and stayed at the Red Lion Inn. So the good reviews and location so decided to order from them. The girl that took my order apparently was new. I order a 18\" Half Pepperoni and half Hawaiian, also ordered Cheesy bread with marinara sauce. With them being down the road and ordering at 9pm it was odd that she said it would be 45 minutes. Anyways, when I received our order it was 100% incorrect. I got a 18\" pizza half pepperoni with pineapple and half with normal bacon. Also instead of cheesy bread I got a hamburger pizza?? When I called they first offered 25% cash back or to resend the cheesy bread, I don't believe they understood my order was 100% incorrect. Anyways we resolved the issue by getting full credit for the next night so looks like dinner was planned. In the long run, things happen and I get it. Once it was all resolved the food was good, service a little slow. But hey it beat getting up and going somewhere!"}
{"text":"Really about 2.5 stars. Pizza is mediocre at best. Decent texture and bake but really bland and flavorless. Certainly edible but not good enough to become a \"go to\" by any means. Delivery took 20 minutes longer than quoted which is kind of annoying considering it's less than a mile away (don't judge me haha)."}
{"text":"Ok I'm 46 years old and don't tend to say 'OMG!'. But, OMG! The marinara sauce with the bread sticks is as good as my North End Boston Nana's!

And yeah they need to buy better delivery bags."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, the breadsticks are addicting.

That's where the fun ends.

The first time I ordered, they were out of spinach (I stray from the ordinary..), and they called to ask what I'd like instead. Understandable.

The second time I ordered, it was delicious and perfect. Woohoo!

The third time I ordered, we ordered a specialty pizza. It arrived missing two of the ingredients! It had also cooked unevenly in the oven, leaving one side perfectly cooked and the other slightly burned.  Unacceptable.  And if I hadn't been all flu-like and had noticed sooner, I would have called or even just sent it back with the delivery person.

I'm hesitant for a fourth try... when they're good, they're great.  It's just that they're not always good."}
{"text":"Right on! Great wings, loads of extra ranch, a yummy cannoli and delivered under the estimated 45 minute wait! YES!  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"One word: Delicious 
*insanely fast delivery*
Affordable...great deal will definitely be ordering more pizza from here."}
{"text":"Really good but the pizza was a little underdone.  The flavor was really good.  The flavor of the pizza dough really stands out and I was really impressed.  The wings were also really good.  We tried the teriyaki and the bbq. Nice flavor and really crisp.  I did prefer the bbq over the teriyaki.

I will definitely visit again the next time I make a trip to AZ"}
{"text":"How could Brak not try a joint named Spacoli's, even if it's not spelled the same as the famous surfer dude?  Heck, they even have the proper \"no shirt, no shoes, no dice!\" sign on the front door.  Have been here a couple of times, and the pizza was average-to-better both times, but the second visit was bizarre.  It literally took about a half hour for the pizza to be ready, and the manager/owner type dude was very concerned and made us a free 2nd pizza to make up for the wait.  That was a nice gesture, but what were 2 just-fed people going to do with another pizza?  Eat it cold the next day?  Some sort of coupon for a subsequent visit would have been a better solution, nonetheless we appreciated the gesture.  I have a hard time recommending this place, not because of that incident, but because of the location.  It's in a very sketchy strip mall, right next to a dive bar that has lots of \"interesting\" patrons hanging out around the area around Spacoli's.  The parking lot is filthy and I felt like I needed a shower just from having been there.  Not sure I'll be back, but if not, it won't be the pizza that keeps me away, it'll be the surroundings."}
