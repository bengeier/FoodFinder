{"text":"I finally got to try this restaurant after passing it for years. We were a group of about 15. Despite the name this is a great place for a group. There was an ever larger group near us. They can separate the groups with curtains.   No disappointments. The service was great. Pizza as a starter had an excellent crust. The Oso Buco de cerf was amazing, on a bed or risotto. The only thing a little weird was the chimicuri on the side. The three chocolates for desert was very good, but too much after such a big meal.  Bring your own wine helps keep the bill down.  I will be back."}
{"text":"My overall experience at this restaurant was good. It's a bring your own wine which is always fun. The place is nicely decorated with music that isn't too loud.  I went there with a small group. In my opinion, this restaurant is good for any kind of group. The food was tasty. However, the service was a bit slow.  I took the onion soup. It was an interesting thing to use a puff pastry on the top, but it wasn't cheesy enough the way I like it (but that's personal). My next dish was the confit de canard. Very good! It came with fries. They were good, but I would've preferred something a bit more original like a gratin dauphinois or some kind of rice. There also was a very small salad . It was a bit bland. Some other people on my table had the Osso Buco and said it was very good! The dessert was a dark chocolate mousse with a homemade marshmellow dipped in chocolate. We started singing 'happy birthday' for my friend and the waitress immediately brought a candle to put on the dessert, which was a cute gesture! The mousse wasn't too sweet and the texture was nice! Finally, we got offered some tea or coffee which was a good way to end the supper."}
{"text":"Small, quaint, so FRENCH!  You feel as if you are in the heart of France.  I heart the duck confit. SO GOOD!!  It is a bring your own wine here.  Excellent service and attention to detail. You will not be disappointed.  Good for small groups here."}
{"text":"Au Petit Resto, malgré son nom, Au petit Resto n'est pas un petit resto. J'y ai été dans le cadre d'un souper de groupe, nous étions 10 et nous avions le menu de groupe.   On peut y voir toute de suite une certaine atmosphère conviviale. Il y a un petit foyer en plein milieu, pour se sentir à la maison. Les hôtes sont très aimables, ils se sont accommodés à notre groupe et on permis certaines personnes de prendre autre chose que le menu de groupe.  J'ai commencé avec une salade de betterave. C'était bon. Salade de betteraves, verdure et fromage de chèvre. You can't go wrong with that. Je vous avouerai que, jusque là, rien d'impressionnant.   C'est au menu principal que la magie a fait son effet.  J'ai choisi de manger la cuisse de canard confite, salade et frites maisons. Je dois dire que c'est très bon. La cuisse de canard était si tendre et dure à la fois. Les frites étaient malade, car elles avaient un peu de gras de canard qui avait coulé dessus. Oh oui.  Alors que j'étais enchanté par ma cuisse de canard et les restants de mes collègues, le charme a diminué au niveau du dessert. J'ai pris la crème brûlée. Je sais, c'est un peu le dessert trop facile. J'ai donc été déçu en goûtant une crème brûlée qui ressemble aux autres. Je recommanderais donc le tiramitsu, qu'un ami avait pris et qui était bien bon.  J'y retournerais? Peut-être pour les soupers de groupe, je dois dire que la place est vraiment pratique pour cela."}
{"text":"As usual, Guillame is the best of hosts.  I had not eaten at Petit Resto in years, and he had since moved to a larger, fancier location.  But, on one call, he took my reservation and gave me the best table in the house!  The food - I had the cassoulet special, totally filling, totally greasy (in the great way that the French use grease!), and delicious.  My guest, a brochet of scallops and jumbo shrimp (hate that oxymoron...).  Perfect!  I would eat there every night, except I might get fat...but I love to be able to bring my own wine."}
{"text":"This place is incredible!  The owner and his wife are the most attentive and delightful people.  We were seated next to the wall of glass/windows which allowed us to \"people watch,\" as well as, the falling snow.  :)  The restaurant is intimate but large enough to reserve for dinner parties.  You're welcome to bring your own wine and there will be no cork fee charge. The food... EXCEPTIONAL!!!  Our group ordered Horse Tartar (Tartare de bavette chevalier), Lamb, Veal, and Filet mignon (Filet mignon de boeuf sauce Petit Resto).  The Filet Mignon was absolutely the best I've ever had the privilege to consume.  The service is impeccable.  Simply put, this restaurant is an undiscovered gem!  If you're ever fortunate enough to be in Montreal it would be criminal to not reward yourself with this exceptional dining experience!"}
