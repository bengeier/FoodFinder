{"text":"Tonight my boyfriend and I ordered to go from here. We order Finn Fries and a buffalo chicken flatbread. I was told me when I called that it would take 20 minutes we showed up at exactly the 20 minute mark only to wait for 25 extra minutes once there. When we finally got our food it was cold and had obviously been sitting in the back the whole time. We got home and had to heat up the food and it was horrible. The Fries also had no seasoning on them and were completely plain. Horrible  experience. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"After eating here, I developed worst case of food poisoning that I can recall in my life.   I doubt that I will ever return."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed lunch here many times and find that the quality of the food, service and price are great!  The lunch menu is very diverse! I usually go for the lemon chicken with a side of rice and broccoli OR flatbread with soup or salad. I have never had anything bad here.  Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a lunch uptown!"}
{"text":"Great service, and the food was amazing. I was a little disappointed on the serving size for what I ordered (cheese tort with broccoli and tomatoes). I mean if I'm spending 16 for a plate of pasta I would have expected more...but then again, they do advertise themselves as being a little higher dollar so it's fair. They have a decent outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Food and service are good but the temperature is awful. It's always extremely COLD during lunch. Very uncomfortable dining experience."}
{"text":"Pretty solid bar and restaurant. The food isn't going to knock your socks into a coma or anything, but not too shabby.  If you utilize their nifty beer specials beforehand, you may not mind the salt overload. The staff was friendly enough and the bartender seemed like a swell fella. I brought one of my considerably less handsome and intelligent friends with me, and they did not openly mock him, or even ask why such an amazingly hot and cool guy such as myself would hang out with such a knuckle dragging mouth-breather. Kudos to the staff at Blackfinn's for making my hangers on feel almost deserving of spending an evening with me."}
{"text":"I seem to end up here at least once per trip to Charlotte.  I never leave disappointed.  The food variety is wide and the meals are always good.  There are also several local beer options."}
{"text":"After working in restaurants for about 7 years I have a pretty high tolerance, but was very disappointed with my visit today. Stopped in for brunch and started out with mimosas and bloody Marys. Bloody Mary was amazing. Ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken avocado salad. The salad came out wilted and completely drenched in dressing. While the chicken was fantastic, the waffles tasted like cardboard and were hard as a rock. The 2 or 3 potatoes that were on the plate tasted like they were cooked in oil that wasn't hot enough. The drinks were  good, but we definitely won't be coming back for food."}
{"text":"I've never been to blackfinn in the early afternoon so maybe my experience is their norm.. I went with a friend and we ordered soup and a buff chicken wrap. It was taking so long (30 mins) for our soup to come we told them we wanted the wrap to go. Only to discover later that we got a chicken caesar wrap with broccoli instead of what we did order?? There was maybe 5 other customers in there besides us so it's not like this was a mistake due to being busy  Sitting here right now, it just took 17 minutes for a vodka tonic to be brought to our table (the other drink still hasn't came) our server never introduced herself and doesn't come by."}
{"text":"Awesome place for newcomers! Ask for Matt - he knew the menu like the back of his hand and have great recommendations. The menu is simple but not boring."}
{"text":"Josh the bartender was great. The drinks taste amazing and he talked me into getting food and it was wort it. He recommended the mac and cheese with chicken and I will definitely order that again!"}
{"text":"Ill give them the benefit of the doubt with the generous 3 star rating as it was somewhat busy and I did sit at a table I the bar area. Our server was M.I.A.for the majority of my time there. Beers came out after the food even though they were ordered at the same time. Bartenders could not have cared less about a single customer. Big applause to the hostess, who did a fantastic job greeting customers, running food, bussing tables, and trying to smooth over guests. A large thank you to the one server (not named Ashleigh) who stepped in and took care of us and not-too-thrilled customers around us. Food was defiantly on point, especially for 11pm and the cooks getting ready to shut down the kitchen. That did a lot. Our personal server was rude and I understand it was busy, I work in the industry too but it does not excuse the fact of making a customer feel like they are a bother. If it wasn't for the competency of the rest of the staff it would have been a disaster. Would have been nice to see some sort of manager on the floor trying to save the sinking ship."}
{"text":"LOVE that the normal menu has gluten free, vegetarian, etc. marked directly on it!  I got the blackened brie appetizer which tasted heavenly! For my main course, I had the chicken stir-fry which was also a winner.  The staff was friendly and accommodating for our group of about 10.   Overall, great experience and tasty food."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent, one thing I noticed was the music got louder as I was eating my dinner. Having a conversation was out of the question by the time out meal was done. He waitress was great, she apologized, but I asked  her if she turned the sound up? She replied no, so there is no reason for her to apologize."}
{"text":"I have only been here once. Nice establishment and the food was pretty good. However, I got up to use the restroom and ended up slipping in a big puddle of grease on the floor just outside the bathroom area. When I got home I had a huge bruise on my leg. There shouldn't be puddles on the floor for customers to slip in."}
{"text":"We have eaten at black fin several times since they opened, while the food is good the constancy is non existent. On this visit the food came out and the food runner was asked a question on which had dressing on it and he said \"I don't know\" and proceeded to place the food on the table. Well one went back since it was not made right, not to mention the soup that was ordered never came with the food. I asked the manager were the soup was and she proceeded to go and get the soup. Well if she had checked the ticket she would have seen which was ordered but she did not and brought out the wrong soup. She was asked for extra dressing and that took a while. She then brought out the right soup but it was not hot a all, I sent that back and it finally came out hot. The others we  were with ordered a ceaser  salad, well the dressing was obviously bad since it tasted like bad anchovies. They sent the salad back and we were told that they make it all the time. The manager never came back to the table, if I was the manager and something went back to the kitchen I would have come over to the customer... the bill came and to our surprise they did not make any kind of adjustment to the bill to compensate for all the trouble that we had. Honestly yea they are very busy since they opened but that will wear off in time and its obvious they don't seem to care...... to go out to dinner and spend money you might want to think twice about blackfin"}
{"text":"Went there last night for drinks for my birthday visiting from NY. Not impressed and to top it off, a cocktail waitress or barback girl with short blonde hair was walking behind my fiancé yelling rudely to move. Her friend who did NOT work there was screaming profanities at us. We have a one year old and don't get out much and our from out of town. The girl and her friend were very trashy and made the establishment look bad. We own a couple bars in NY and would not tolerate such employees or behavior."}
{"text":"Despite our Thursday night room temperature entree and food runner kid who has no idea what \"customer service\" means, I assure you that the server and restaurant manager were on their A game!! Sapphire was our server and not only does she represent classic southern hospitality but she was a great communicator. The restaurant manager came by our table several times and was over the top accommodating. A cool place to be and the staff makes it worth your while."}
{"text":"Food...excellent...waitresses...not so much.   I have never experienced such disdain from my primary server.  It was my son's birthday and our family decided to have a pre-celebration at Black Finn.  Her service and attitude dampened our mood.  Thankfully, Amelie's welcomed us!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a late dinner here after the Panthers game, loved the bar and atmosphere while watching the World Series and SNF, service was good and prompt but the FOOD was seriously lacking, like crappy chain lacking. Mac and cheese was dry and unseasoned, add on chicken was sooo dry and cold, husbands burger came without cheese as requested so they brought a tiny slice of American (no melted cheese . Great place for a drink I would say skip the food and eat at flemings"}
{"text":"food is awesome. my first yelp. and food is awesome. but they got rid of the blue cheese tomatoes. so minus a star. this appears to also be a vt bar #goacc"}
{"text":"Fun place for happy hour friendly staff.  Love the apps for happy hour.  Wish it were closer.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great American Food Excellent beer wine menu Service great  Prices good clean  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was my first time there, and we went for a brunch event. I thought the food was ok (very basic and a tad bland), but they didn't seem interested in keeping the very limited buffet items stocked (or even plates). We sat outside and I think had a server come by once in the 2 hours we were there - had to go inside to the bar for everything (water, coffee, etc.) Also, I thought it was weird that it was a dog-themed event, yet there weren't any water bowls/stations on the patio for the pups."}
{"text":"Went Friday night. It was packed. Music was outstanding. Appetizers were delish. Drinks were great. Salad was outstanding. We will go back very soon"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time last night and for a Saturday night the place was a madhouse. Still, the bartenders kept their cool, were fast on the drinks, and kept a smile on their faces throughout all the crazy.  Didn't eat at Blackfinn last night, but their menu looked good so we stopped in just before noon today for lunch. Also wanted to see the restaurant when it wasn't packed wall to wall. Service was really prompt and solid, which almost always is the challenge new restaurants face. The wait staff seemed very well trained and I was impressed.  Fish and chips were delicious. My husband loved his French dip style sandwich. I like this location much better than the uptown location. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Met a friend for drinks at Blackfinn prior to Bruno Mars concert at Spectrum Center.  As expected, it was PACKED!  We found a spot at the upstairs bar, and had to wait just a few extra minutes to get a drink ordered.  It was generally longer than I'd like to wait to be served, but considering the timing right before a 20,000 person event, it was reasonable.  Our bartender was fine - not rude but not especially friendly.  Beer and martini were good.  Ordered fried deviled eggs and fried chicken sliders to eat.  The eggs were pretty disappointing.  They were fried to perfection, but very bland.  I love a deviled egg, but these lacked lustre for sure.  The fried chicken sliders were fantastic.  Very fresh and tasty.  The food did take FOREVER to come out - like maybe an hour.  Again, we should expect some service delays during a hyper-busy time, but this was pretty bad.  I would probably give this place another try on a night with no event if we lived nearby."}
{"text":"Great food, great date night spot and the prices are reasonable. They usually have local beer on tap and in bottles too! I would recommend the skillet of Mac-And Cheese with pulled pork. Delicious! The staff is always friendly too."}
{"text":"Disappointed to learn that one of our favorite lunch spots did away with their lunch menu...   if you are looking for lunch under $20 this isnt your place not to mention the service at lunch is not quite as fast as dinner.  Disappointing experience today overall"}
{"text":"Mediocre food . The chicken tenders is blend no flavor . I would not go back . I never knew it was this hard to make chicken tenders .."}
{"text":"I don't have high expectations of bar food. But chicken tenders should not be so tough that they are hard to chew. These had no flavor, so needed to be dipped - but the ranch dressing had so much garlic it was hard to use. The pimento cheese was good - but served with Ritz crackers?? Most tables inside were high tops, and these stools were uncomfortable for sitting very long. To me, it's a place to sit outside and have a quick beer. The beer list is adequate, just not stellar for a pub."}
{"text":"It often comes down to your waitress and when she doesn't bring the appetizer you ordered, messes up another order, is never seen so drinks aren't refilled, doesn't clear the plates off the table when we're done, and takes 15 minutes to bring the check, I can only hope she was having a bad day and this isn't considered the norm.  Our group of five goes out to lunch once a month and was hoping to add this to our rotation, but sadly won't.  We all order several desserts to share each time we go out, but as you probably guessed the check was delivered before we were asked if anyone wanted dessert."}
{"text":"Showed up on a Sunday and restaurant is 1/3 full yet its been 15 minutes amd we havent ordered our meals or gotten our drinks. Little annoyed by the slow, unexcited staff.  They have large screen tvs with sports which is nice. Booth seats are comfy and tgey have high tops as wrll. Large bar."}
{"text":"Meh. Something about this place just screams average to me. The food is okay, nothing special. The atmosphere is a generic pub/sports bar type vibe. The drinks and bar menu are all average."}
{"text":"Bartending staff is unfriendly and inattentive. More interested in standing around talking than serving customers. Food is overpriced and generic too."}
{"text":"Overall not impressed. I have been to the location in Knoxville, TN and loved it but was very disappointed at the Charlotte location. It's a small location and there was no hostess so you just say yourself which is fine. Our server was nice and did a good job. The food did take a very long time. 25+ minutes for 2 entrees and a side salad. There was a manager present but he was just watching the basketball game on the tv the whole time. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"4 stars on Monday  thru Saturday. Good food selection and what we had tasted really good. Really good beer selection and plenty of tv's and seating. The problem with Sunday - where to begin. Too much loud music. I was there to watch football not listen to a rock concert. Also, while I appreciate Aarons Rodgers, I was there to see him on 19 out of 20 tv's. If you want to get an established good crowd, please, turn down the dang volume on the music a little and show someone other than the Packers. Can't wait til next Sunday when it will be the panthers on 14 tv's and the Packers on the other 6. I would return any day but Sunday until they fix the problem."}
{"text":"Waitress was friendly and we were seated immediately. The food came out relatively on time. The quality and size portions were comparable to any other chain restaurant. The price point seemed higher for a place that could easily be compared to any Applebee's or Chili's."}
{"text":"Had the Queen City Chicken and it was great, I recommend to anyone that likes Italian sausage and pepperoni with their chicken."}
{"text":"I ate here over the weekend while in town for a wedding.our waitress,Alyssa,was very friendly and knowledgeable!She recommended the Chicken Parm to my sister.The tomato lemon basil linguine was a delicious change from a marinara sauce!My apple bourbon haddock was very good and I loved the mashed sweet potatoes that came with it!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is super underrated for pub food. I have never had a meal here I didn't like and usually come here a couple times a month. Great service and beer selections. Highly recommend if you're in Uptown/Epicentre area and looking for a laid back meal!"}
{"text":"2 stars for effort. Ate here on a Thursday about 2 weeks ago and man was I disappointed. First of all...it took someone over 10 minutes just to ask for drinks. I was on an hour lunch break so I was irritated.   I wanted to order the \"pick two deal\" a salad and soup. The salad I wanted wasn't apart of the deal so I told him to just give me the full size of what I wanted. Well what I got was a wilted Caesar salad and vegetable soup. I am big on meat so my meatless lunch felt like an afternoon snack. The waiter was aware of the mistake and he apologized and offered to bring me what I wanted. Well I only had 20 minutes left so I declined.   Overall, I didn't like the vibe in this restaurant and the slow service so I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"First I like to thank Yelp for the gift cards we won. This place is great, we ordered salad, flat bread pizza and the our meal, within mins of ordering our salads came out, when the salads were done, a couple of mins past and then the flat bread came to the table. We were able to finish the flat bread and have a little break before the main meal came out. (so I would say it was right on time for the food coming out). My wife had the pan seared chicken  (wow) this was very good. I had the Queen City Chicken, this was very good. Over all I would say we will be back. 5 stars for food and service."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch with family. The food was great and the server was fantastic. Will  definitely be back especially for game day."}
{"text":"Stay away! Awful service. Staff can't handle the amount of people coming in. Worst service you can get in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere; really friendly staff; nice menu selection....Much better then the average chain pub. Quick bite or a couple of drinks... Good social stop."}
{"text":"First time visit. I realize they just opened and are busy with all the Packers fans (???) but we waited for 15 minutes to get our drinks, then another 45 for food that was disappointing. Honestly not our \"scene\" with the loud music etc but maybe we will try again at a less busy time. If the food is the same the second time, we will not return.  On a positive note, the fries weren't soggy."}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations. Staff were professional and friendly. The Ahi Tuna salad was excellent. And the choice of quality beers was very good too. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"So I checked in at Black Finn 27 minutes ago after being here for 30 minutes and we still haven't gotten our food. I understand that there is concert tonight and you're slammed but plan ahead. And they just brought out our fries and nothing else. I've been here before and have never had an issues but this was the worst. Upside the bartender gave us free drinks and the food was good. They apologized several times. So I'll give them another chance."}
{"text":"I recently came to Blackfinn Ameripub for a lunch when I was in Charlotte recently.   The staff was amazing and the food was okay. I think the menu was extremely extensive. My biggest gripe was trying to narrow down what I wanted to eat. I had the California Naked Bird, based on a recommendation, and found the portion to be rather small. The burger itself has no bun. You can choose a salad on the side if you'd like to feel a bit more full after your meal.  The location is convenient since it is located on Uptown and near all the sites and shops."}
{"text":"I walked in with really low expectations, given the other reviews here. I was pleasantly surprised. The burger was good and so was the service. If you find yourself in this neighborhood of Charlotte, this place is solid."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my first time here and I have to give a bad review and it's not about food since I never got the chance to eat! I just wasted an hour and a half waiting for a table only to be told it was going to be another 15-20 minutes.  The place is crazy busy and I understand there might be a wait at 6:30 on a Saturday night but over an hour wait is nuts! I would have appreciated a text message letting me know that my original wait time of 40-45 mins would be longer so I could have made the decision to wait or take my name off the list. I'm new to the area and certainly hope that this isn't what I can expect when I try to eat out in Charlotte. I see from the other posters that this is a fairly new restaurant and I'll give a bit of slack for that but if they want to stay is business, they have some serious kinks to work out!"}
{"text":"Came for a quick meal and was highly disappointed with their time management. I was only able to order a cocktail drink in the hour I was here. By the time I decided I would not stay for dinner the server took an additional 20 minutes to close out my bill. The hostess proceeded to pour out leftover drinks from tables into potted plants in the outside seating area. Overall highly disappointed given such a great location."}
{"text":"I ordered from Uber Eats and got the wrong food, which seemed like it was an issue with the menu that Uber Eats has up. Anyways, I called and let them know and they went ahead and fired up the right order for me and said it would be ready in 10 minutes... No hassle... I did have to drive there, which wasn't a problem at all but the hostess and manager, Mellissa, has my food ready and a $20 gift card. Great service. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Had the worst service I have ever had. Not only was the service slow but the heater outside went out and the management didn't seem to care. I have never had a problem before but this was unacceptable."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in to have a drink and an appetizer.  Unfortunately it was St. Patrick's day and the place was slammed with a pub crawl.  We were sitting at a table outside and asked the manager if he could please ask the people that were congregating behind us to move over a little bit so that our chairs didn't get slammed every time a waiter would need to get by.  The response I got was \"it's just the nature of the pub crawl\".  Absolutely unacceptable response by the manager of the restaurant.  About a half an hour later there was, of course, a problem with the people behind us and they eventually got kicked out when they wouldn't get out of the way of the waitress who was trying to serve the other tables around us. I understand the place was busy but when I ask a manager to help us make it a little more enjoyable I would expect a little satisfaction.  All we wanted was him to ask the people behind us to move over a little bit and clear the aisle. After all was done, the bouncer and the waitress thanked us for helping them keep the aisle clear."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place to meet up with friends Uptown for drink, or a full out meal.   They have a pretty solid draft selection, as well as a full bar selection. Their bar bites/appetizers are delicious ... I'm a fan of their chicken tenders. For dinner, the shrimp tacos are tasty, but nothing extraordinary. They have a great patio area to enjoy the warmer months.  This place is packed at night, and is a definite 'hot spot' in Epicenter for drinks. It's pretty average priced for Uptown."}
{"text":"I LOVE Blackfinn. I love it so much that one day about two weeks ago I went there for lunch and then ventured back for an after work send off for one of my colleagues. There were about ten or fifteen of us. Professional friends from work, paying customers looking for a laid back environment to enjoy ourselves. I am going to skip the food part because it is irrelevant to me at this point.   A highly intoxicated customer (eyes glazed rolling in the back of his head) approached me. He began to harass me about the racial composition of our table. He felt there were too many races intermingling and it made him sick. I shielded the rest of my colleagues from having to engage with this man, but could not get him to leave us alone. Finally, a directed him to the patio when I flagged him down. Upon their exit, the table behind us told us he had also approached them and was complaining about our table's racial composition to him.   I let the Blackfinn worker know about the situation and not sure if it was a manager (assuming it must've been) but the person who came back from Blackfinn apologized but said they would not be able to ask him to leave because he wasn't doing anything illegal. Well, it is illegal to be that drunk in PUBLIC.   The REAL issue is that Blackfinn OVERSERVED someone and didn't want to be liable for this guy who was probably quadruple the legal limit driving behind the wheel of a car. I worked in the restaurant industry for years and we would've told this guy to leave in a heartbeat for harassing customers.   SHAME ON BLACKFINN! You should've called him a cab and paid for it yourselves. Their nonchalant attitude sickens me and I won't be back despite loving their food."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good! Came here feeling hungover and in need for some good food. I loved that the menu had 3 different ways to consume one of my favorite hangover foods, the buffalo chicken sandwich. I went with the sandwich with the Caesar salad (trying to be healthy) but I tried some of my friends fries and wow, they are awesome! Overall great service, massive selection on the menu, and one of the best buffalo chicken sandwiches I've had in a while!"}
{"text":"I will not be coming back. Food was good but service was horrible. We arrive and wait over ten minutes to be seated as there is no hostess to be found. Several servers walk by and never acknowledge we are waiting. Our server Sam needs some retraining. I set my empty tea glass out and she walked by probably 5 times before I spoke to the manager Ben about getting a refill. He then says he will take care of it. He proceeds to have another server bring me a tea instead of doing it himself which a professional manager should have done. I've worked in the service industry in the past and this is not acceptable."}
{"text":"I was out for dinner with office colleagues and everyone wanted something other than pizzas or burgers, so we went to Blackfinn.   Me being a vegetarian, I asked them to customize their Shrimp pasta for me which means I had a simple veggies pasta.and it was really delicious. You don't expect too much flavor when you order a pasta and it was a pleasant surprise.The portions were generous and everyone in our team loved the food. Few of my colleagues ordered Shrimp, Steaks, New York Strip etc and they really liked what was served.   A male-server was a little rude to me, when I requested him to take a picture of our group, and it took one star away from this review. Otherwise, this was a great experience and this one is primarily for the Chef coz he/she did magic with that pasta :) :) and the sweet girl who was our server for the order."}
{"text":"I went here the other weekend with a group of friends. I made a reservation for the 9 of us. We actually got there 45 in early to grab some drinks at the bar, and when we walked in, they told us our table was ready. So we grabbed some drinks, waited for some more friends to arrive, and then sat down.  Our waiter was very nice. We split some appetizers, such as the tuna and spinach artichoke dip. All of them were amazing. Even though I was very, very sad that they ran out of moscato at 8pm on a Saturday, they had other fun martinis to drink. My fish tacos were OK-not as good as I wanted them to be. Everyone else really seemed to enjoy their food. Overall, I'd go back here with friends and just order something different."}
{"text":"I went in here tonight with 2 of my friends. It was our first bar of the night. Ordered 3 shots; half liquor half juice. And it was almost all juice. Not to mention the bartender with the fancy watch couldn't have seemed more bothered to serve us when he had maybe 3 tabs currently running and no tables in his section. He threw the shots at me and my friends from across the bar. Paid over $24 for 3 shots. Go upstairs to Howl at the moon to get a STRONG bucket for only $3 more and much better service."}
{"text":"Great place, always hit it up when I am in town.  Wait staff are cute women and always have sports on.  pub and saloon area's are great to watch games.  food is above most bar's and beer list is great."}
{"text":"We are in town for a conference and stopped by here because it was close to the hotel. It was so good we came back the next night too! Amazing food and wonderful service. We really liked our server, Madison, and asked for her the next night, too. Wonderful experience; highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the service. Waiter failed to bring one of our drinks, rarely ever checked on us, refilled drinks etc... had to flag him down or remind him of things. Seems like an isolated issue as the other waitresses seemed to be very on top of things. Food was good. Some items are WAY overpriced, others priced right. Plenty of TVs to watch the games. Comfortable atmosphere. If I went back I may try and get a different waiter/waitress."}
{"text":"First time here and it may be my last. Ordered food well over 20 minutes ago. No voluntary updates. When I inquire, I'm told that they are swamped in the kitchen and that it should be out soon. If you knew you were swamped, just tell me that."}
{"text":"I was here once on a business trip and it was pretty good.  I would definitely go again given the chance.  The place was pretty nice overall with a good bar; nothing to complain about.    The waitress was great.  I was part of a large group so they gave us a smaller menu to choose from; not the full menu.  I had used yelp and checked the menu online so I knew what i wanted before i walked in (mac and cheese with BBQ pork) but it wasn't on the small menu they gave us.  So I ordered what i wanted \"off menu\" - kind of and everything was fine.  The waitress checked in to make sure i liked it.  FYI the mac and cheese w/ BBQ pork is really good.  The service was fast, the drinks were cold.  good times."}
{"text":"I had made a reservation for brunch this past Sunday with 14 other ladies. They put us upstairs in a semi private and quieter area which was nice. My only complaint with that area is that there isn't a bathroom upstairs. Overall the experience was good. We had one waitress for 14 people which was fine until the end when we all had separate tickets. My complaint is that it's a lot of tickets and maybe another person helping would have prevented multiple tickets from being charged incorrectly. Everyone enjoyed the brunch items as well as the salads and hamburgers. We had no complaints with the food or drinks. We wanted this to be our regular place for meeting up but I'm not sure if it will fly since several of us were charged incorrectly and weren't willing to spend another 30 minutes trying to sort it out."}
{"text":"A great restaurant/sports bar with a fun uptempo vibe. A little loud if you're trying to have a conversation with your date, but we enjoyed the patio very much!! The wait took forever, so be sure to do call ahead seating at least an hour in advance"}
{"text":"Surprisingly surprising for a basic bro-pub.  Any time you walk in and see Chive TV playing, you know it's gonna be a hit or miss experience. Everything about Blackfinn's Ballentyne location feels like a Hickory Tavern. They are almost one in the same, but the key difference is the quality of the food. Blackfinn does a lot of things really well. Going in with very low expectations initially, after about 6 visits I have been happily proven wrong.   I have yet to have anything that's just doesn't taste good at all or has evidence of using crap ingredients. They are one of the few restaurants I've come across that does a from-scratch turkey burger and it's really good. Most places tend to go the cheap route and use some sort for manufactured, frozen thing. The flatbreads are pretty tasty, their salad list selection could use a little enhancing, but they are still pretty good, the bacon wrapped meatloaf is hearty and flavorful, and they seem to know what they're doing in the sandwich department.   The beer and drink selection is great with reasonable prices. The service can be hit or miss at times, but sitting at the bar insures you can get in and out in 30 minutes or less.   For a tacky, American sports pub, Blackfinn Ballentyne hits the mark on several things. You definitely have to, in order to pay the rent for their prime real estate. If you need a casual spot in Ballentyne for a quick bite, you can't go wrong here...truly a 3.75/5, but I have to round up at that point."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Hosted an event here and the staff was beyond phenomenal and helpful. Grab a Mango Or Cucumber Cooler for their drinks, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Even tho they have a soft opening a week ago and officially opened 3 days ago. To be able to host about 150 Packer Fans on this wonderful opening football Sunday. All hands goes up to them. Yes they have their kinks. But overall, it runs pretty smoothly.. Our waitress Lacey was adorable.. She check on us often.. Our drinks are alway fills. Our empty plates are promptly removed.  Our Packer fan base have grown. So from the Angry Ale, Taco Mac and now Black Finn. Overall, I was very impressed with BlackFinn.. They made sure they're fully staffed to host our group.. From what I heard.. Taco Mac wasn't good in that department. So now we can call BlackFinn our home where we can gather together and cheers on with other cheeseheads! No doubt they will work out their kinks in no time! So now I cant wait to go back. Til next Packer game. #gopackgo"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today and never been to this location but the hostesses were welcoming. They seated me outside as I requested. The cheerful waiter, Jack, came out and immediately took my order. Food came out fast and the BBQ chicken flatbread was delicious! I was alone outside but that didn't stop Jack from checking on me more than enough times. Today's experience was cool and if you come by here request Jack, he's awesome!"}
{"text":"It's a common go-to because it's at Epicenter.  With all the bank workers in the area, Blackfinn can fill up during happy hour.  I've been here a few times, with the latest visit during dinner.  The ambience is best described as folks in suits who have been loosened by half a dozen beers.  For dinner, I had the fried chicken, which came with roasted potatoes and collard greens.  To me, the best part was the greens.  I love the bitterness with a dash of spice.  They had the perfect consistency, which take a lot of time in the pot.  I enjoyed the potatoes as well; they also had the right level of doneness.  Lastly, the fried chicken was decent. I just didn't enjoy the heavy gravy that went on top of it.  It was heavy and overpowered the chicken.  I couldn't really scrape it off since it had softened the breading on the chicken to the point that it all would've fallen off had I tried.  Service was friendly, and the waitress remembered to asked me if I wanted sweetened or unsweetened when I ordered iced tea.  It's something I always forget to indicate when I'm in the south, so I'm glad she made sure!  3.5 stars for the food, rounded up to 4 for the service."}
{"text":"Do NOT come here for work lunches. Regardless if you have a party of 4 or 12, you cannot walk out of here in less than an hour and a half.   This has been a constant theme since they opened up and a half dozen lunch trips later. Unfortunately we think things will change every time, they have not.  Food is good which is why we keep coming back. I'll come back on a Friday for lunch when I want an extra long lunch."}
{"text":"Great sports bar! Very chill atmosphere and a great place to watch the games!"}
{"text":"Paul's Yelp Elite Rating: 3.75 Stars  Always a solid lunch spot, today I ordered the Double Bacon, Double Cheddar cheese burger and it was (surprisingly) REALLY good! I don't know why, but I expected an average burger! Duh....out of all the times I've been here the food has always been solid (but not spectacular). So today I decided to \"take the plunge\" and order the burger....I've had MANY of the other lunch menu items, and have never been disappointed....but for SOME strange odd reason today I thought differently.....thankfully, my worst fears were slain and I had a REALLY good burger!  So my experience here in Charloote is that when you order a burger \"medium,\" you get well done. That's just how it normally is here in town. So that is what I expected. BUT, much to my (very pleasant) surprise, I got a very MEDIUM burger today! YEAY! It was slightly red in the middle and Paul was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO happy! Very juicy and tasty all in one bite! And since I got a \"bacon\" burger, I asked for my bacon (extra crispy and well done) and they DELIVERED! Yeah #2!  Finally, the fries. Wow they were really GOOD! They must have been taught at Johnson and Wales University (where I learned to make great fries) because their fries were VERY tasty......crunchy on the outside and soft and pillowy on the inside. VERY yummy!  The 2 guys I met at lunch were very \"friendly\" with our lovely waitress.......and shey took it like a seasoned Pro....even though she was young and \"no match\" for my work crowd!  Overall, a really great place to have a lunch!"}
{"text":"My God, what astonishing food. This ain't pub food, this is so much more. My visit tonight was a couple of days after an event at the same restaurant, I really wanted to see an \"organic\" run of dinner service, out of the critical spotlight.  Krissy and I got seated right away. After getting our drinks, we saw some things on the menu quickly and just placed apps and entrees at the same time. Food service was very fast. I wish the appetizer had come out before the entree but everything was brought all at the same time. No biggie, that is how we ordered it!  Chipotle Queso was outstanding. They're adding a new Jalapeño Pale Ale queso to the menu soon so I wanted to give this one a try. Good base, velvety texture, and just a hint of heat. It was a tad on the salty side but this is quintessential bar fare so no problem at all. Huge fan of this.  Krissy got the ginger tuna entree and the best part of her tagging along is stealing bites! The tuna, oh wow. I'm usually a purist when it comes to tuna because it's so easy to overwhelm the delicate flavors, but they showed a lot of discipline with the ginger and overall seasoning. The sear, phenomenal. I'm actually arguing about which was better, the tuna or the green beans served alongside it. Lightly seasoned Tuna beside cranked up garlic green beans, match made in heaven.  My steak and frites was a big home run as well. Perfect medium-rare skirt steak, thinly sliced, and seasoned with salt/pepper/garlic, simple as can be. Spot on execution and served with arugula and fries. Is it crazy for me to think of greens next to a steak typically as an afterthought? Blackfinn proved me wrong tonight as the vinaigrette tossed on top cut the fattiness of the steak so well, they have an eye for balance. Outstanding fries, hot, rich, and crispy!  With all that praise, praise, and more praise, it's a shame that the visit was soured slightly by our waiter. Between ordering, 15min wait, food coming out, and eating all but the last few bites, there was no sign of him. I had actually saved 4-5 bites of my steak waiting on a refill because I was very thirsty. It wasn't that we couldn't flag him down, he simply wasn't anywhere to be found. The wait staff station was right beside our table so I was dumbfounded as to what happened. I really wanted to order a Birdsong Jalapeño pale ale to go with my meal and my girlfriend a glass of wine, but no dice. By the time the refills came out we were finished with our plates. The check came shortly after and that was about it.  Such a shame, the food was perfect. Chad and Matt are doing a phenomenal job in the back of house. I just found myself envious of all the neighboring tables getting better service. If the food made this review 6-stars, the service unfortunately lost it 2! Really bummed on being the bearer of such news but hopefully next time I'll be able to give it that final star! Hell, as long as the food is as good I'll be back no matter what."}
{"text":"Came in here for about 10 hours on Friday during the NCAA tourney games.  Sat at the bar where Mike and Nina were working.  Both of them were awesome and really took the time to talk with us even though they were very busy.  a couple of other bartenders we had really weren't friendly but faked it well enough.  Food was good and they did a great job of changing channels for all the games.   this place is not light on your wallet though.  if you are planning on eating, drinking there for a few hours be ready for a $100+ night  also, charging a cover after 930pm for a bar???  come on.  get over yourself"}
{"text":"Went with a friend for dinner and drink before heading to a show. We sat upstairs as we were told it was a little quieter (which it was... but the place overall is very loud). Food selection of food, I had a wedge salad with chicken and my friend got a steak, which she said was good, but a little lacking in flavor. Service was very good, especially considering how busy they were. When we went downstairs to leave, it was PACKED! Lots of people there cheering on teams for football games. Good experience. We'll go back.. and will remember it's not a place for quiet date night."}
{"text":"This was the biggest letdown I've experienced in a very long time from a restaurant. I attended a graduation luncheon with 22 guests & a set # of options for guests. The reservation was at 1pm. All guests were seated by 1:13. We did not have dedicated servers, so we wound up having to walk behind the bar to get ice & refill our tea, water, and lemonade. Yes, that's how lacking the service was. We only got caught getting our own ice once during the 3 hours we were there. It took a guest tracking down waitstaff to take our order, get the drink pitchers refilled, etc. The food took so long to get to the table that when one of the guests went to find a server, another guest went to another restaurant & brought takeout back to share. The manager Chad/Chaz finally came by and said that when the server put the order in it never made it to the kitchen, which is why it was taking well over an hour to get to us. The restaurant wasn't busy, so I'm still wondering why the kitchen staff wasn't wondering where the order for the big table was (especially since the party was reserved well in advance). A few guests got the fish & chips. They remarked that the fish was good, but the batter was so greasy that they removed the crust (which was shiny & hard). They said that you could actually taste the oil from the fryer. One little girl ordered the burger & fries. She destroyed it & said it was the best burger she'd ever had (not sure if it was or if she was just that hungry). The mother of the graduate got a chicken wrap & fries with a side of hair (yes hair). The step father got the lemon chicken, which he said was good (but he'd never seen a recipe for rice pilaf with little bits of angel hair pasta in it). I ordered the crab cake sliders. They were decent but had a fishy flavor to them. There continued to be a lack of service & I almost felt bad for the manager on duty. He was sweating profusely every time he came to apologize for something else. The first set of cake plates they brought actually had chunks of food on them. And some of the rolled utensils had food on them. The glass with my iced tea had food on the outside of the glass as well. The manager said he'd make it right before the bill was brought. They brought out a platter of cookie brownie bites. The strawberries that garnished the platter were gorgeous! However, the flying insects that came with the platter kind of sealed the deal with my disgust. By the time I left the restaurant I wasn't feeling well. I barely made it home before I got sick & spent the rest of my evening near the bathroom. I don't feel much better this morning & yes, I spoke to the manager last night so he could check the crabmeat. But this was a horrible experience. I had a much higher expectation from the appearance. The food, health standards, and service wasn't even marginal. I realize we were there  a long time. But it was mostly spent waiting/looking for service. And for all of the issues with the luncheon, the manager only took off a whopping 15%. Yes, epic fail Blackfinn. Your staff needs training in the BOH & FOH."}
{"text":"Awesome place! I work in the area and we've been coming since they opened! Great for calling in lunch and for coming in after work for drinks! Nice new touch to Ballantyne."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the excellent service this would be a 1* review. The food was FLAVORLESS. I mean white bread FLAVORLESS. The beer selection was so-so for an Ameri-pub and the speakers were deafening. Won't go back."}
{"text":"It took a minute to get greeted and seated.  Once we sat our server asked us what we would like to drink.  I asked about the whiskey selection, she said she had no idea and sent me to the bar.  The bartender really wasn't well versed in her stock because after she was done I had to point out the top shelf whiskies.  The bartender poured the drinks, several minutes later our server dropped the drinks off and left.  Ten minutes later she came back over and took our orders.   My husband ordered a Greek salad and an Apple Bourbon Glazed Catch of the Day.  I ordered French Onion Soup and the Balboa.  Our salad and soup came out first ( which we requested).  My husband's salad was fine but my soup was cold, the cheese was not melted and it had a funny taste.  After our server passed us a couple of times and after several minutes of it sitting at the end of the table she finally inquired how everything was.  I told her it was cold and tasted funny - she apologized.  A few minutes later our food came out - my husband's food was fine but again my sandwich was ice cold.  At this point I was so hungry I just ate it.  When she finally came over and asked how it was I was almost done.  While I was in the middle of explaining - she walked away - SHE WALKED AWAY while I was mid sentence.  Granted it was to get the manager but she walked away - rude.   The manager Jeremy came over and he did apologize for the food being cold - he said which I can only hope was joke that the kitchen staff was hung over because of the holiday.   What I didn't say to him - which I should of - if the server spent as much time taking care of her guests then hanging out the bar with him, the other servers and staff maybe our experience would not been so poor.   The manager did comp both the soup and sandwich which was totally unexpected and we were grateful but we still will not return in the future."}
{"text":"Very Fun place and loved the vibe great service ! It was super busy but Bartenders and servers were awesome. They have a really good menu. Lots of TVs. The outside patio was pretty nice. I had the ying yang shrimp and it taste pretty good. I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers but fries were a bit salty. The shrimp spring rolls and nachos were delicious!"}
{"text":"Bar area as first come first serve on Saturday 6pm. Several 2-tops open. If we had had a larger party, it would have been a 45-min wait for the dining room.  Salmon spinach salad was good, perhaps a bit heavy on the dressing for my taste. Little One had cheeseburger and fries, with no complaints. French fries were among the best either of us had tasted.  Around $30 with 2 soft drinks; in and out with plenty of time for the theater.  Service was average."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink while waiting for friends. Great cocktail on tap special White Cran Sangria! Bartender was nice and I was taken care of quickly. Crowd demographics is 30+ which I liked and bar was clean. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the atmosphere and there chicken tacos. A good place to watch football if you don't mind not having sound on."}
{"text":"Was visiting Charlotte last week and went there for lunch had fish taco  it was great , one of the best I had next time I'm in Charlotte I'll be there again to try something new."}
{"text":"Good location in the Epicenter.  One of my favorites.  Extensive menu.  Our server Lindsay was great.  Pretzels and cheese appetizer is a great starter.  Good atmosphere and drinks."}
{"text":"I was a bit leery about Black Finn opening in Ballantyne as we lived in Uptown Charlotte our first three years here and it was pretty much known to be a \"beer crawl\" kind of place. We were most pleasantly surprised that this Black Finn location caters to all tastes and age groups. The food and service have been consistently excellent. They have two outdoor patios for those of us who prefer a bit more peace with our dinner (interior very busy & noisy). We even order takeout from them on evenings we don't feel like cooking or going out. They are a very upbeat cheerful group and we always enjoy our time spent there. And for you wine drinkers, don't miss their \"Wine Down Wednesdays\"!"}
{"text":"Liked the food options and quality. Also liked the environment."}
{"text":"Annoyingly crowded.  Had to leave!!   How could you eat?"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I end up at Blackfinn quite often because of its location in the Epicenter. They have a variety of food that meet a lot of different needs. And working for the city, the crown lamps amuse us.  The food is good and comforting, but nothing extraordinary or different. We were there for lunch. I did a pick two meal where I got a buffalo chicken flatbread and house salad. The food took a while to come out. Other times I've been here, it also seemed a little slow for food. The house salad was fresh with mixed greens, cherry tomatoes,  onion, pine nuts, parmesan and kalamata olives. I got what the waitress described as a green goddess dressing. It had a creamy garlic flavor and was pretty good. By the time I got to my flatbread it was a little cool. It had a nice buffalo and blue cheese flavor. I could have used additional hot sauce.   You can expect good service, consistent food in a comfortable bar environment."}
{"text":"Really awesome food, drinks and the best staff! Jeremy, Ben, Jack, and Chris( my girl) all rock. They are always friendly and make us feel like family! Cannot say enough great things about BlackFinn in Ballantyne!"}
{"text":"The service was prompt and everyone was very kind. We had the Finn fries as an appetizer, as well as the crab and shirmp dip. Both were great. I had the blackened chicken alfredo, which had the perfect flavor."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE FOR FOOTBALL. I normally LOVE coming to this Blackfinn. The food is decent, they have a great happy hour and their rotating taps are impressive. I went to Blackfinn to watch football yesterday and I had some issues with the manager. I understand I am in Charlotte...and people want to watch the Panthers. I also understand that managing 40+ TVs is annoying and you cannot please all guests when it comes to channel requests. I've worked in the service industry before. I get it. I also know that this is a Packers bar...but the Packers weren't on until 4pm.   I walked in at 1:07pm to watch the Pats game after the fire alarm finally stopped. I walked in and all but 4 TVs were on the panthers game. Again- I get this. I was seated in the corner and asked if they could switch the TV in front of me over to the Pats game. Only 2 other people were watching this TV and I even asked them if it was cool.  The first excuse the manager gave me was that I should have arrived at 1pm to make special requests. I'm 7 minutes late...my fault. The second excuse was telling me that I am in Charlotte and that we are supposed to be watching the Panthers. Do you realize that like 90% of Charlotte is made up of transplants? The third excuse was \"well I can see if I can change it but you got to buy these guys (sitting at the next table over from me) a beer for the inconvenience. I'm buying wine by the bottle AND getting food. I don't need to buy anyone else a $3 bud light draft.   Of the 40+ TVs that you guys have and there being about a dozen 1pm games on, why do I have to go through this much trouble to get one TV changed? I absolutely get that you receive a million requests to change the channel, but damn. This unnecessary push-back definitely did NOT want me to come back...even to watch the Panthers game. Good luck with your business."}
{"text":"Went for 7pm dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Waaay too loud.  Had a sore throat from screaming just to have a conversation.  Waaay too crowded.  Food was mediocre.  Everywhere you look there's a TV.  More of a hangout place than a dinner place.  Not a fan."}
{"text":"First thing I noticed: I never had to ask for a refill. They just kept coming and I was so impressed. I had the 12 hour pork mac and cheese and it was incredible. The pulled pork was perfectly seasoned and I could taste the buttery-ness in the mac and cheese. 12/10"}
{"text":"My guy and I stopped in here for a few beverages and a snack to finish watching the Carolina game and to start a night out for bday fun for my love. This place is A-OK I mean its just a really reliable go to place for food and drinks. They have 2 levels with a bar on each floor. I always end up upstairs for some reason though. They are a little pricey nothing to bad but while I always leave satisfied I'm not like itching to come back asap. I do like that they have a lot of tvs that make it an obvious choice for any sporting event that might be happening. The bartenders are ok they don't say much to you and you may need to flag them down should you need something.   The food has always been good here I have to say. The other night I had the steakhouse salad the bleu cheese was outstanding and the steak was a decent cut. My guy had a turkey burger which was really good not a huge portion though which I actually prefer but he was still hungry after the man could eat all day long and not be full. They have patio seating on the first floor and parking available in the epicenter parking deck and is located in the front entrance to the epicenter."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Food is very good and service downstairs is A+....I have been getting the baked haddock with fresh green beans! It may be one of the best pieces of haddock I've ever had! Fresh and cooked perfectly. I always sit at the bar and the bartenders downstairs are outstanding! Very friendly & engaging! I also come back because of Ishmail. He is one of the best bartenders in Charlotte! So respectful, remembers your name, shakes your hand! There's also another male bartender (tall, white) that is awesome also! If they could get the rest of the  bartenders to carry themselves like these 2 guys do, they'd \"hit a home run!\" I realize upstairs is different at night (rushed, busier and more like a club), but the lack of smiles and coldness of some of those bartenders (many are females), can be nasty!"}
{"text":"It's a big sports bar in a nice location.  There's a patio (with tvs, which is cool and something we don't see where I'm from).  The menu is varied and the beer list is long (yay!).  I had the fish taco lunch offering with rice pilaf.  I've had pilaf a zillion times as a kid and I've gotta say, this was among the best I've tasted!  It had little chopped veggies (zucchini and such) in it and it was WAY better than I expected.  The fish tacos (I got them fried) were quite good too!  Service was on point and our waitress was delightfully sassy (matching me and my dining companions)."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I had a very lackluster dining experience here on Saturday night. The plan was to have a girls night to watch college football and eat dinner. We called ahead and asked when the best time for 7 people to come in and get seated would be. We were told to show up before several other large parties planned to arrive at 6:30. So we arrived slightly after 6 and were told there would be a 30 minute wait and that they would text us when our table was ready. The bar being a complete zoo, we decided to grab drinks at mellow mushroom while we waited. We arrived back at blackfinn close to 7 to check on our table. We were not seated until after 7:30. So a 30 minute wait TRIPLED and became over an hour and a half. There has got to be a better way to set expectations. There were a couple parties waiting with us and they were equally peeved and given low wait times. The young hostesses looked terrified but never offered apologies. Once we were finally seated the foot was good and the service was okay. This may just be growing pains but it was more than just a little annoying."}
{"text":"Watched the Panthers beat the Pat's here Sunday Great place to watch all of the games on Sunday Great prices on special drinks and food at the bar  Clark our bartender was great and all the people in reataurant were very friendly  Food was very good  Great Burger!!!! Will go back!!!         This Restaurant deserves five stars however today they are -2 stars for the following reasons Melissa the bar maid  that serve me took extra napkins that I had in front of me and inadvertently put them in front of another couple that was sitting next to me probably without even realizing it then she took some clean plates and placed them in front of people but had her thumb in the middle of them hopefully she has clean hands the food I ordered was the chicken and green sandwich was absolutely delicious fries were fine the beer was fine the service was fine the place was jumping it's a very good place"}
{"text":"I want to start with the positive, so I will say that the food here is better than average bar food. I had the crab cakes (which are more like piles of crab meat and breading) and french onion soup, and my friend had a burger and fries. The food overall was pretty good.   This place gets two stars because of the service. Our waiter was too busy socializing with his coworkers (I could see him chatting with them from where we were sitting) to refill our drinks or bring us our checks. I had to get up from the table to get his attention.   Worse, I saw the manager walking around socializing with coworkers as well, and he never looked twice at our table to see if we were receiving attentive service.    This happened on a weekday lunch hour, by the way.   They cherry on top was that both my seat AND our table were rocking back and forth. It's a little too soon for furniture to be falling apart, in my opinion.   With all of the restaurant choices in Ballantyne, I definitely won't be back here for a meal."}
{"text":"Such a deceptive restaurant with terrible management. I went to blackfinn on Cinco de Mayo and asked the bartender if they had any specials.  He said yes and preceded to tell me that they had $2 corona lights and $4 draft beers (not to mention he used his fingers to tell me the amount they would cost, so there was no miscommunication in pricing).  I figured the $2 corona light deal was a good special so I ordered to.  When I asked for my check (they already had my card so they paid it out) my total was $11.  I asked the bartender why it was $11.00 when the other gentleman told me they were $2.  The gentleman who told me the special returned and rudely told me that he said $3 (even though he definitely told me $2, besides it does not add up to $11).  I then asked to speak to the manager and wanted to pay the price I was told. The manager told me there was nothing he could do except buy me a beer.  He preceded to pour me a beer without touching a register (a beer I doubt he comped off, therefore stealing from the bar that he is managing. Definitely not sketchy at all)! I found their customer service dismal. I will never return.    They lie and steal your money!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch and drinks.  Sat at bar.  Thought it was OK overall.  Service was good but surprisingly they were out of some wine and bourbon that I wanted, especially on a Wednesday.  Food was OK, buffalo wrap was just OK.  Peel and eat shrimp was the highlight."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant especially since the Bucs game watch is here.  Ordered the fried green tomatoes blt and a side of fries.  Great food and service.  Great fans and just a fun atmosphere.   Go Bucs!!!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located near shopping and  the  movie theater  this restaurant with outdoor seating   has a nice menu with very upbeat friendly  service. However the inside ambience is so loud and noisy with tvs  and music I would only choose outdoor seating another time. The food was good, fresh, plated nicely , with moderate portion size. The quality in my opinion  ran the gamut from very good to mediocre. The fried fish was excellent, coleslaw mediocre, cut homemade  fries good. My chicken avocado salad was basic and could have had more chicken and avocado in it, in my opinion, meager amounts of chicken, avocado and bacon. The green goddess dressing was excellent, I asked for extra dressing.  My dining mates shrimp and linguine was very good with plenty of shrimp . Prices were moderate, good menu choices ( see photos). The restaurant was packed on this Friday night. I would try something else off the menu another time but eat outside."}
{"text":"I really can't say enough good things about this place.  Ishmael (our bartender) is honestly one of the greats!  Do yourself a favor and come here and have a good time.  Cheers Ishmael!  Great drinks, Great Food and a friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Blackfinn and It was better than I had envisioned.  I am not normally into the pub thing or pub like food.  Blackfinn offered more than traditional pub food.  My selection was lemon chicken with capers, brócoli, and rice.  I subbed out the rice for French fries.  Not one morsel was left on my plate and I wish I could have picked up the plate and licked the remaining of the lemon sauce.   Just plain yummilicious.    The bar is a massive wrap around with lots of seating.  There are a lot of high top tables in the restaurant.  I prefer regular booths.  Thankfully, they had a great booth for us. The service was very efficient. This is another great option in Ballantyne Village. I can find absolutely nothing to rag on here.  If you want a lively environment with big screen TVs, jamming music, and very decent food, this might just be your place."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and had a great experience. The server was very attentive and continuously refilled our drinks. Our food was out quickly and tasted great."}
{"text":"Parking around is limited, so I usually have to park in the parking deck. I only come here for the salmon and the crab dip. The crab dip is a hit or miss though. Sometimes it's really good, other times its SUPER greasy. Their salmon is flavorful. I usually get it blackened with the lime and peppercorn glaze on the side. I'm not too crazy about their quinoa and green beans, so I substitute them for their potatoes (amazing) and broccoli.  Last time I went, they ended up blackening my salmon.. literally. The skin was completely burnt and so was the top. I wasn't upset or anything nor did I mention anything to the server because it took her a while to check on me, so I just ate in between the burnt areas. Had I not been STARVING, I probably wouldn't have ate it."}
{"text":"I came to this place because it was next to where I was staying and they had a big variety of food.   I ordered the French onion soup for an appetizer, it was good, can't mess that up. The entree I got was meh. I ordered the bacon wrapped meatloaf. To me it didn't have any flavor even though you can tell they put the most in it. It was like bland sausage pizza lol. But hey, you cant eat everyone's meatloaf. The green beans were yummy.   I got dessert too. I think it's called the brownie chocolate chip avalanche? It was okay.   Maybe it wasn't a good idea to order the meatloaf. I'll come back and try something else"}
{"text":"Cocktails after Wedding Dress shopping with a few of my girlfriend to celebrate her soon to be U ion with her fiancé.   This rating would have received 2 stars if it wasn't for Conner the bar back and delicious fries that came with ranch and BBQ sauce that I wanted and didn't have to ask for. Great move on serving those two with your fries. Now down to review business.   When I arrived they had already started on their beers so I ordered another round. A tall guy with dark brown and had in a green UNCharlotte 49ers jersey came over and said \"yeah! What you want?\" Not how can I help you, would you like to drink, what can I get started for you? None of the proper bar questions you would expect from the bartender.   As my drinks arrived my friend mentioned how rude he was and to go ask the bartender in the purple Jersey if I needed something else. I said no I won't ask him anything either because he also was snappy when we asked why did they ring the bell. They have this bell at the bar, so when someone tips really well the bell is rung. I'm not sure what really well meant to them. But at the rate these bartenders were going no bell ringing would be taking place for them from me. Ironically my friends ended up agreeing and saying the same thing. The bartender in the Purple Jersey also told He told one of my girlfriends when she asked for a beer, \"you're going to have to hold on because I have five other drink orders before you.\" For someone to have the time to muster all those words and form a sentence that was rude. Could have simply said \"give me one moment if you will and I'll take care of that for you.\" Yes they were extremely busy because they are the new and hottest bar in Ballantyne right now. But that should give you more reason to be respectful because you want returning guest.   FLAG ON THE PLAY!!! They allowed two children to sit at the bar with their families while they waited in their table. This has to be illegal, right? I felt sooo uncomfortable sitting right beside with looked like a four year older and six year old with my beer. I never drink in front of my children. But for this family to sit them in their laps, at a bar, and the bartender serve them and not acknowledge it was baffling.   I will say there was ONE person that was the absolute sweetest to work with. His name was Conner and he was the bar back. I told him if I could leave him my tip I would. Because he was in top of refilling our waters, greeted us with smiles, said yes ma'am no ma'am, provided napkins, silverware. And I shared with him how I appreciated his kind services and generosity. Unlike the actual bartenders I had been dealing with. And I told him I would be sharing my review on yelp as well as with his companies mangers. He said thank you I appreciate that from you.   While I was sharing with Conner my appreciation the guy with the purple number 5 East Carolina jersey over heard me. Then his WHOLE demeanor changed. He started being overly nice, to the point where he bought us a round of shots because we were celebrating our friends wedding. And then he wanted to chat with us, and we just were not having it at that point. You had plenty of time to be personable with us while we were there for 3 hours and spent a total of $60 on just drinks and one appetizer for three women."}
{"text":"If u r looking to watch a football game other than the Green Bay Packers, don't bother coming here. All tvs in the bar will only be showing the Packers. This is the most asinine sports bar ever! Will not be coming back here for Football!"}
{"text":"My colleagues and I stopped here to grab a late lunch. We had a party of about 12. The restaurant wasn't busy, but it took our food a reaaalllyyyy long time to come out. When the food arrived, it was quite tasty. I ordered the apple bbq salmon salad and a side of mashed sweet potatoes. I highly recommend this as an entree. The salad was very filling."}
{"text":"Walked in the door to try and watch the Nacar race, it wasn't on. We sat down and it took about 5 minutes before we were even acknowledged. Finally she asked us what we wanted so we ordered two draught beers. She got us our drinks, we paid, and she disappeared. We were going to ask if one of the tvs could be switched to Nascar but she wasn't around. When we finished our drink she finally came back around and asked us if we wanted another. With such terrible service, we respectfully declined and left. Also, she moved at turtle speed...so take that for what it's worth."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really really did but it was just okay.  The food was decent but not worth the price.  The service was top notch.  The drinks weren't anything special.  The people watching,however, is amazing.  My girlfriend and I did get to see a 50+ year old man hit on every single 20 something girl there until one of the men in their group initiated an altercation.  That was probably the most exciting part of our visit."}
{"text":"We came here during our 12 hour (yes 12) layover in Charlotte. This place has a slightly divey feel. It was also dimly lit. I liked the atmosphere, everyone in their own conversations and several sports games playing on the tv screens as \"background\" noise. It was relaxing. I forgot our waitress's name, but she was very friendly and assured me that my meal choice was a smart decision. I ordered the shrimp and grits (labeled on menu as a restaurant specialty). I really enjoyed it, it had a different look than your typical shrimp and grits. There was a creamy sauce surrounding the shrimp, grits and sausage. The only negative thing I would say is that the blackened shrimp was a bit too salty for me. Aside from that it was great. I would come back, if I ever come back to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Well.... it's a Tuesday - roommates birthday, last minute decision to check out the \"new\" place in the neighborhood. We are currently sitting at the bar. His first time here will probably be the last. It may not be the bartenders responsibility to notice the persons birthday while IDing - but at least smile. Have to say, these are the most grumpiest people working this shift. You are working in customer service - smiles are free. After all, word of mouth is huge in this industry. Least to say, our food just got here and no one has even assisted to ask if everything is ok or if we need anything else. Not cool. Good luck keeping this location open with such service.   *** this is an update of the rest of my night - 40 min later. I never do this but I had no choice but to leave a \"zero\" as a tip. My drink was done and it was towards my meal when someone asked if I would like another one.  No thanks. Here is a tip. On a \"not so busy\" night - cater to your guests. Not just a select group at the bar. To top it off, manager was passing by on and off without any acknowledgment.   Kudos to the guy who said he'd give me some more marinara sauce. Cause after all I wasn't even asked if I wanted ketchup with my fries"}
{"text":"Having just moved to Ballantyne (after moving six times around Charlotte, from Uptown to South Park) we were very skeptical about Blackfinn Ameripub which was known to be a cheap beer hall (i.e. $2 Coors & stuff. . .the place where \"kids\" went during their pub crawls. I even called them about that as it just didn't seem right for Ballantyne Village, next to where we live. Spoke to the most pleasant and reassuring people who truly gave me and my husband hope. They just opened and have been more than we expected. Super friendly and enthusiastic staff, very interesting menu (far more sophisticated than one would expect), and the food was GREAT!!! We've ordered from them twice, never disappointed (actually surprised at how good the food was!). OK, we're not kids and don't need the TV's and all that noisy stuff, but we can't wait to sit out on their dog friendly patio. Blackfinn, please stay as wonderful as you began. WE NEED YOU!!!  P.S. Really addicted to your special salad which I share with my husband before digging into that fab chicken dish (was it called Chicken Roma?). We WILL be regulars and spread the word."}
{"text":"We choose Blackfinn Ameripub because it was close to our hotel and the menu seemed tasty. I ordered the strawberry goat cheese salad and my husband ordered the spinach salad with salmon. The time:7:50 Sunday evening. We finally were brought our salads by the hostess 45 minutes later. Both our salads had the wrong dressing and to get that corrected took another 10 minutes. Thank goodness we had dressing on the side. If they had to make new salads we would still be there. The waiter never checked on us and we had to flag down another waitress to get our check. This restaurant was not busy! Go someplace else. Too many other great restaurants in Uptown."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, pricing is fair but the food isn't extraordinary.  Ordered two burgers one with cheese one without and they both came with cheese. Drinks were a bit watered down. Staff is super friendly, there are televisions everywhere in the bar area so you won't miss a game. It's our second visit and it's great if you're going to a game or a show at the epicenter due to its close proximity."}
{"text":"We had our 2016 NFL Draft Party here. They provided us with the entire upstairs. We were situated near the bar area. Our waitress was Justice. She was very nice and attentive the entire time. I have been here for dinner and other game events before and have always had a great time. They have great food. You can't go wrong with the Asian Ginger wings. They are so good!  I would have given them 5 stars save for the fact that our draft party was scheduled to start at 7 but they weren't quite ready. Otherwise, a nice experience with a great staff and great food."}
{"text":"I went to Blackfinn's on a Monday night with a few friends. We didn't know it was Trivia night, so we ended up getting involved in that and won second place ($25 gift card!).   Food: We started with the Finn fries, queso, and soft pretzels. The fries were nicely seasoned and came with buttermilk ranch and bbq ketchup. The other two apps were ok. I ordered the lime seared salmon as me main meal. It had a great crust to it. The only thing I didn't like about it was it was a little to salty. Other than that, it was cooked really well and was a nice portion size.   Service: A little slow and not super friendly, but not bad either. Our waitress was quick to bring out drinks and refill our water glasses, which is always nice.   The have a really extensive menu with tons of options ranging from healthier (salads, fish, chicken) to more decadent options (burgers, pulled pork, etc) at a good price point. I'm not itching to go back but I did like it!"}
{"text":"Great food but the am usually here with a large group over lunch break, and every time we wish the service was quicker and that they took into account a lot of people have to hurry back to work.  Take our orders quicker, bring checks quicker, etc.  A couple people rushed to order before the rest of us so they could leave before the rest of us so that they could make afternoon meetings at the office on time.  At least they have lunch special options. I always enjoy my food here, whether sandwich, wrap, salad, etc.  A couple people ordered the fish and chips and the fried fish portions were huge!"}
{"text":"The rice pilaf and steak are amazing. I know it doesn't sound like it makes sense but it has probably the second or third best steak in uptown Charlotte. They also let my party make our own home made sangria. Love it"}
{"text":"Oh Blackfinn... You remind me so much of college and I'm not sure that that's a good or a bad thing! I certainly don't want to relive that time in my life but it's so tempting at the same time!   This is definitely a fun, upbeat, young bar. I went with a bunch of friends and all we did was dance all night long. The music was great, the dj was great and he played a nice variety of music for everyone to enjoy. It definitely was crowded and definitely was filled with the college scene, which if you don't enjoy, I wouldn't venture out here late night during the weekends. It's a fun environment but you have to have the tolerance!   Drinks were relatively cheap for uptown in the epicenter. I'm sure I'll make my way back here one night when I'm feeling 18 again and party like it won't hurt the next day!"}
{"text":"This place manages to be pretentious Uptown style bar and casual at the same time. Best of both worlds, everyone can be happy here. Really good food, amazing drinks. I came in to the bar in a pretty awful mood and Christian, the bartender, cheered me up without being overbearingly social as bartenders can be. Also Monday nights they have a very casual but fun trivia night with prizes, jokes, and just overall fun. Definitely a top choice in the Epicentre."}
{"text":"Been to both the restaurant and the bar. The restaurant is actually nice and I don't mind it. I wish it was a separate business.   The other night, a few friends and I were hanging around Epicenter and one friend suggested Blackfinn for a drink. My intuition responded with a loud \"No,\" since the last few times I've been there, the crowd has been weird and the vibe was off. Admittedly, it's been many months so I thought, maybe I can try it again.  When we walked in, it wasn't as suffocatingly crowded as it is on weekend nights, but there was still a weird vibe and I felt a little bit uncomfortable in this place. The bartender was curt and seemed like he had a bad day or didn't want to be working there. One friend ordered water and the bartender rolled his eyes.   One thing I appreciated was that the menu has all prices listed clearly. Still, our bill for three drinks was surprisingly high - and we are uptown regulars. If we at least got a friendly smile, it might not be so bad.   I know the business cannot control who walks in the front doors, but it's always a consistent situation where other patrons make me feel uncomfortable here. One other individual at the bar was so overtly staring at me (I'm not dressed in any weird or slutty way) that my boyfriend had to shift his chair so as to block his view. As this patron left, he walked so close to my chair as to brush the length of my hair. There was plenty of space for him to walk by without doing that...   The location will ensure that this business has an audience - I will not be included in it."}
{"text":"Just opened but you can tell, it's gonna be a spot we desperately need in the Ball. Those of us who want late night food or drink in the area, are stuck with Bradshaws or Brazwells. They are open till two, with a full menu and open for lunch! (That corporate booty). The outside patio is really nice, great people watching. Our server, Maggie, was phenomenal as well. Sweet, on point, and ever so friendly. It is what it is people, catch a game, grab some lunch, late night drinks and nachos, or watch the Cougars. Welcome to Ballantyne BlackFinn! I'll be in you most weekends.   Edit: this place is poorly run, with consistently bad service. I avoid coming here."}
{"text":"When looking at the place from the outside, one would expect the decode to follow in the inside. Not so much. The bar area was the only area that actually matched the exterior. The rest of the dining space (downstairs) looked like it was an old 90's Perkins.  Food wise, we had three in our party and each ordered something different:    1) 14oz Ribeye w/garlic butter for side had the greens and mashed potatoes. Overall wasn't bad - green are close to traditional.    2.) Stirfry - vegetables are okay, could have used some heat in the sauce though. Overall the dish was just ok.    3.) pork carnitas - basic food, pork wasn't really tender. Overall - okay.    Two people ordered drinks, a rum and coke and a Long Island ice tea and both drinks had two much ice in them and were watered down.   The menu feels disjointed from the decor. Overall impression is that the place has no real identity, won't be back again."}
{"text":"Man, you have to try the bacon wrapped meatloaf with potato mash and green beans. It is spectacular! You will want to savor it, maybe take some home or another a to go portion!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a light dinner before exploring the epicenter.  The place is open seating so we sat downstairs in one of the booths. The booths all have personal televisions attached (very cool).  Our waitress was absolutely amazing, I wish I could've gotten her name.  I ordered a Long Island iced tea and so did my brother. Our drinks looked completely different. Mine was clear I actually thought she was giving me another glass of water. My brothers drink had the faint brown color. Both tasted disgusting. The waitress said it was because the bartender used lemonade and that she could make it again. I declined and instead asked for a drink nobody could mess up. Or so I thought. I ordered a margarita and so did my friend. Mine looked like a margarita however it was terrible it tasted like soap. My friend's margarita came out next and hers was clear and tasted like salt water. We all sent our drinks back. The waitress kept apologizing even though it was not her fault that they have a terrible bartender. I ended up just getting a lemonade which she completely voided from the bill. I thought that was very nice of her.  I gave this place 4 stars because the food was great. For dinner I had the iron skillet macaroni and cheese with blackened chicken. It was VERY tasty. The chicken was well seasoned and moist. Everyone at my able enjoyed their food.   I'd definitely come back just to try another item off of their extensive menu, but i think I'm done ordering alcoholic drinks from this place. Hire a new bartender please!!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes Epicenter can be a pain to get in and out of but getting into Blackfinn makes it worthwhile.  The hostesses and servers are always very nice and helpful.  It is a sports bar and it has plenty of tv's and they are very nice about putting on the game you want to watch.  The booths in the bar area also have small, individual tv's in them as well!  As far as sports bars go, I'd say that Blackfinn has some of the best food available.  Definitely not your standard chicken wings and nachos.    The cheese sticks are mozzarella in spring roll wrappers with an asian-style dipping sauce...a great twist on this appetizer.  The baked haddock is really good and I would definitely get it again.  The crab cakes are good too, although I might ask for them to be a little more crispy the next time.  If you're looking for sports with better than standard food options...check out Blackfinn!!!"}
{"text":"Nachos app was really good. I had the Mac n cheese, it was also good. Great waitress."}
{"text":"This restaurant was okay. I went during the middle of a banana bar crawl so you can imagine the noise. Luckily they had a back room and they sat me rather quickly. The food was a good price but it wasn't the best. I ate the bacon wrapped meatloaf, sweet potato mash, and green Beans. The meatloaf didn't have any seasoning so that's what completely turned me off from it. The mash and beans were great. The spinach dip was the best part of my meal. My waitress , Judith, was also very sweet and she took great care of my table. I would go again just to try something else but I'm not really sure what I would get this time but I would try it again."}
{"text":"Their new after-work menu is a pretty good deal. There are $5, $7 and $9 items. They also have good daily drink specials. Overall I think the menu is overpriced for what you get. Food is good, just not memorable. Good place to stop in for a drink and some apps if you are going to an event Uptown."}
{"text":"Heading to the \"Epic Center\" for a country concert at roof top establishment. My friend was waiting on me having cocktails as I was riding the silver and blue electric missile.  She mentioned how inside the bar area smelled rancid as if someone had projectile vomited across the entire room. I thought she meant just a dirty ol bar mat. NOPE.. Ohh dear lawd! Horrific smell as I entered the bar heading to the restroom. How are people actually sitting in here eating right now?   Because of the horrific odor, and still opting to eat here, we chose to sit out at the front patio area and absorb second hand cigar smoke instead. The waitress laughed when I made a joke, but other than looked as if she really didn't want to be there. Actually, a lot of the employees looked like they would rather be somewhere other than BlackFinn.  We had questioned how many tacos came in a meal, she stated 2 or 3. We opted for two but she insisted on ordering us three. Huh. Interesting. Listening is a skill. We also ordered the spicy shrimp app. Before those came out, we were greeted with a pimento cheese app compliments of the folks previously sitting at our table that decided to relocate.. and that message wasn't passed down the pipeline.  Cheer up the employees and rid the vomit odors and more stars could be coming your way."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a good experience here for my birthday. The waitress, Sapphire, was pleasant and easy going as we joked around several times. Those kinds of servers are fun to work with...  Everything we grabbed off the menu was tasty, including the ice cold beer.  For my birthday, she was nice enough to bring me a huge dessert loaded with ice cream. whipped cream and fudge topping!!! (See Photo..)"}
{"text":"I was emailed by Sara who is one of the managers for Blackfinn at this location if I wanted to check the place out as well as get some free appetizers. She suggested certain dates and I picked yesterday (Friday) at 730 for a party of 8. She said to just let her know how many people and what time and she will have us down for a reservation. She confirmed with me that she will do that for us.  We got there at 730 and told the hostesses we had a reservation at 730 and the girl told us there was NO reservation and that we had to WAIT an hour. We told the hostess that we had an email stating that there was one reserved for us. She told us that they don't do reservations by email and we were probably at the wrong location. HOW EMBARRASSING!! I finally pulled up the email to show her the conversation between me and Sara and asked to speak to the manager. She told me that they would try to get a table for us and bring a manager up here. No manager never came up to us. We finally got sat and the server was really nice. He knew nothing about the free appetizers and had to ask Sara who also happens to be at the restaurant. He finally came back and told us that we could get pretzels and two flatbreads.   We started off with the pretzels and the mustard queso was good. The pretzels were soft. Flatbreads were also good. Two people got the buffalo chicken sandwich both grilled. Chicken was over cooked and there wasn't enough sauce. It was on a ciabatta bread. This chicken was so small compared to the bread. It was just too much bread and not enough meat. Some got tempura fries and thought they were good.   Overall, this place was ok. I appreciate the free apps but the whole thing was really confusing and somewhat embarrassing especially since Sara the manager was the one to contact me. Obviously, there was a huge miscommunication on their end."}
{"text":"After being seated tonight & waiting 10-12 minutes, no one even asked me if I wanted anything to drink.  At least 6-7 servers walked by my table and to me that just shows that no one cared enough to alert anyone that my table hadn't been attended to at all.  I finally got up and walked out of the restaurant & headed to the car with my son.  But I was upset because I patronized the place on many occasions before and felt that I should address the issue.  I walked back inside the restaurant and told the hostesses what happened.  All they said was that they were sorry and seemed to really not care at all as I turned to leave to give my business elsewhere.  Sadly, I won't return to Blackfinn again and it's a place that I had grown to like a lot but poor customer service will leave a terrible taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"A great place to come for reservations. The food was delicious and so were the drinks. Are service just wasn't that great. The manager did help out a bit though when we were having issues. I wouldn't let it stop me from coming again."}
{"text":"I must start by saying I am basing this review on the food and service of an event held in the top floor of Blackfinn where they provided a variety of catered food options; however, I did not dine in the restaurant by ordering off the menu. In my experience with the food we received, however, everything was mediocre at best. The good: the service was friendly and they were good about refilling drinks; their salad and fruit selections were very fresh (when salad is the best part of the meal it's generally not great news) The bad: pretzels and cheese dip- the pretzels were supposed to be soft pretzels but were way too dense and chewy, not very good at all. Tacos (they provided pulled pork and fish tacos)- neither taco came with much meat at all, the guacamole on the side was very bland, and everything as a whole lacked flavor. Chicken sandwich sliders- I had two of these..the first one had less than an ounce of chicken (literally took up 1/4 of the slider bun at most) and the second was very bland, unseasoned chicken that was way overcooked.  All of the food was very bland tasting and lacked any spice/sauce to provide much flavor. They also overcooked most of the meats it seemed, and everyone was complaining of things being way too dry. Normally I wouldn't write a negative review without actually ordering my own personal meal at the restaurant, but I have a guess from the quality of the catered food that everything here is average at best."}
{"text":"Solid spot. Super busy bar area but plenty of bartenders with great service. Food was pretty good. It was super loud after work on a Thursday. good menu options and plenty of TVs on. We will be back for sure just not sure we will rush back. Not sure why. Just a feeling. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I went out for my friends birthday at the epicentre to do some bar hopping. When we got there the bar was packed so we understood that there could some waiting time to get drinks and the cover was only $5 so that was not a problem. The problem was when we got to the bar the bartender served about 5 people who got there after me which was about a 20 minute wait on 1 drink. Once I am able to ask for Hennessy and Coke she makes me a Hennessy and red bull. She tells me the price of the red bull drink, $13, and I alert her that I didn't want that and she makes the new drink. I ask her what's the price on the new drink and she then tells me the price is $13.  In my mind I'm thinking there's no way the those two drinks are the same price but I pay for it and walk away. I head down stairs to the restaurant area where there's a little more light and I notice that I have a filthy sticky glass. I then go ask the bartender in the restaurant area how much a Hennessy and Coke is and they tell $11. My intuitions were correct. I was up-charged $2 for my drinks on top of being given a dirty glass. After that fiasco we left and ended up having a good time at Suite, but I would not recommend blackfinn to anyone."}
{"text":"We stopped here to grab some food for one of our friends. She'd just arrived and had not had anything to eat. But while we were there, we grabbed drinks too. We were headed to the Janet Jackson concert, so we didn't want to hang long. I didn't have food, but I had a glass of red wine. It was good, can't complain. Our waitress was nice and fast. We told her we had to get in and get out and she made sure that happened. The menus at this place are huge. I mean, I just was distracted by the size and how they were overwhelming the little space we had at our booth. And each of us had one. I should have taken a photo, but I forgot. My friend said she liked her food. Everyone enjoyed their drinks, but those menus have to go."}
{"text":"Great GF options both in lunch and for general menu.   I had the roasted chicken and cooked well with steamed beans and side salad.    The staff were great as well.   The surrounding area is filled with all sorts of restaurants and stores."}
{"text":"Blackfinn is your very average sports bar/restaurant. The service was fine, not great but not bad, the food was mediocre at best, very basic bar food. Two great things were the draft beer selection as well as the outdoor seating. if you're a beer drinker looking to catch up with some friends over some snacks, go for it.  But if you're looking for quality food, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Worthless bartenders. The bald one took my order and apologized for my fries and fried tomatoes weren't out 40 minutes later. Then had to ask 3 times for the tab and wait another 20 to pay. Skip this B squad and go somewhere that knows how to run a business"}
{"text":"Had an amazing avocado chicken salad. It was hearty and very satisfying. My 4 stars are for the salad alone, it was THAT good.  We didn't care for the fried green tomatoes as they were all crunch, minimal tomatoes. I also felt they were too expensive for such a casual place."}
{"text":"We have been ousted 3 times now due to private parties, a dedicated GB Packer bar, after spending a lot of money and ruined our plans. Very short sighted management decisions by alienating your base guests. At lease send notifications on special events/closures so we don't waste our money, time, and plans. You just lost us. Shame on Blackfinn."}
{"text":"Wow! Sure wish I'd been sooner. I know Blackfinn from their various other locations, but haven't been eager to try the one in Ballantyne because I hate parking in that \"plaza\" -- but we decided to give it a shot on Sunday. Football was on the tube and the place was booming.... I was nervous when they sat us in the far corner (thinking our service would suffer), but.... I was wrong! Service was great, food brought out promptly and was absolutely delicious (and fresh). I ordered the California naked bird which was seriously worth coming back for DAILY! my husband ordered the crab cakes and our wee one opted for the flatbread. I loved how one of the side choices for kids was apples w/peanut butter. They were dusted with cinnamon for a little extra deliciousness. The tab was reasonable and beer specials were above par for Ballantyne ... so glad they're here and we're soon to be regulars."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. The service and food are both hit-or-miss. It is a fun place to watch games though. Other than that, it's not anything outstanding or worth it to go out of your way."}
{"text":"Went to Blackfinn in the Epicentre area on Saturday night with my Wife, one of my daughters and her boyfriend. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with friendly staff, and the General Manager came over to say hello to us. We tried a little of everything there, and all of the food was excellent. Our server Brandi took perfect care of us and the GM checked on us several times to make sure we were pleased.  I couldn't have been happier and would definitely recommend Blackfinn."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere and quick seating.  Server was very mediocre in attitude and suggestions.  The night took a turn for the worst when I discovered a piece of plastic wrap inside my bacon wrapped meatloaf.  Will not be back!"}
{"text":"So surprised at the unique menu offerings, not your usual pub food. The service was a little slow."}
{"text":"It's just one of those places that aren't the best at one thing, but there's nothing really bad to say either. And the fact that it's one of the very first places I've been to right after moving to Charlotte makes me feel a bit attached to it.  I don't go there often, but everytime I'm there, I enjoy it very much. The food is nice, the service is super, and it's vibrant but not tooooo loud up or down stairs.  All in all, I'd recommend it, especially because it's right there in Epicentre. Go try it. I think you'll like it whether you're looking for a place to have a beer or two watching a game, or for happy hour with a bunch of your friends."}
{"text":"We came here and ordered drinks and food. My drink came and it was filled to the brim with ice and virtually zero alcohol. So my food comes out (turkey burger) and it was terrible. It was very tasteless and the fry portion was small. The waitress put in the wrong order for my friend, but her food came out and she wasn't satisfied either. All in all, we will never be back and don't recommend this restaurant to anyone...."}
{"text":"I see from the reviews are all over the place.  For a while I liked this place but now I've soured on it and don't know if I'll be going back. First introduced to this place via Meetups and initially I liked the vibe.  It typically does attract a good crowd on the weekend nights.  Bartenders work incredibly hard when they're slammed and deserve credit for that. When I started to go bad on Blackfinn was when I started to venture here on my own upon moving to Uptown and coming during times when they weren't slammed.  I started trying some of the food and while not terrible it wasn't much to write home about.  You pay a premium for eating at the Epicenter which is why as a general rule you're better grabbing a bite outside the Epicenter whenever you can. Also, and I know Blackfinn isn't the only place guility of this, but when they're not as busy the bartenders start getting a bit lazy.  A lot of time talking amongst themselves, on their phones or talking a lot with one customer (a lot meaning over 5 minutes with one customer or group of customers).  What this is that despite not being busy you're getting slow service.  You sometimes feel its easier to get a drink when the place is packed because there aren't distractions.  So yes I gave credit where credit is due but criticism of the customer service is warranted her.  The bar staff need to seriously up their game. Oh and one bartender was a total d-bag to me after I was trying to joke around a little but we won't go into that one.   Not saying I would never go back but unlikely I would go back by myself.  It's just not a single friendly environment."}
{"text":"This place is great and the service is top notch! We've been here a few times and it's always crowded so there is a bit of a wait for a table but worth it. Has a nice atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"I'm really sad for this place because they really had the opportunity to crush it in the Ballantyne area.  I should have updated my review many visits ago but last night takes the cake.  I had the privilege of previewing their new menu and remember loving the watermelon and tuna poke at the event.   So I was excited that I would be able to try it again. It was no good, hardly considered an actual Poke dish (since I couldn't identify the poke sauce in the dish) and my cucumbers were soggy. I don't dish out many bad reviews...but come on guys...that should have never been served to my table.  The took it off my bill but as someone that regularly checks out dining spots, I'll find it hard to recommend you guys.  Some other dishes my group tried, was the ying yang shrimp, pretzel bites, Finn fries, honey hot flatbread.  I guess out of all those..my top pick would be the fries and pretzel bites.   Your drinks and specials are amazing.  So I recommend you check them out for happy hour or casual drinks...save your appetite for something else."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed, to be honest. Came here on an 85 degree day to enjoy dinner outside and instead had to sit upstairs in the freezing cold with every fan going on top of the a/c because of a \"buyout\" downstairs and outside. I couldn't see my meal because it was so dark, and I'm now pretty sure there were little oranges in it, which I'm allergic to, based on how I'm feeling. (they weren't mentioned in this menu item.) It was also crazy loud. Bummed I came here for my last night in town"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and had the blackened chicken pasta which I thoroughly enjoyed.  I like its convenient location to my job, with plenty of parking in the nearby garage. Also, they have an extensive menu.   A little something for everyone.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My spouse and I stopped by Blackfinn last night when we were told there were no tables available at Fleming's. I'm so glad there weren't any tables available at Fleming's because we  were very happy with our meal. My husband loves iceberg lettuce wedge salad and Blackfinn's was huge. He got tons of bacon and really good bleu cheese dressing. In fact, he didn't want an entrée because he enjoyed the salad so much. I had a slightly dry Caesar salad with dressing that tasted good, but needed more dressing. My medium-well ribeye was tasty, but needed a little more moisture. It was supposed to have a butter drizzle, but it needed more. The bacon cheese grit cakes were the star of the show. They were crunchy on the outside and really moist and delicious on the inside. We didn't need dessert because we were very full. Thanks for being there for us, Blackfinn! We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great location and view, nice interior, good service, but just OK food. The price point is high as you'd expect. I ordered a few different menu items and have never been impressed, the flavors just seem on the bland side. Portions are smaller than expected too, like come on... fries are so cheap, give me more!"}
{"text":"Prob a great bar but not a great restaurant. Out of my first choice entree. No veg for the second entree. Salmon was two butt ends that were super dry. Service was poor. Bartender obviously had somewhere else he'd rather be."}
{"text":"I had the fillet mignon off a prefix menu, it was one of the best steaks I've ever had. The location and atmosphere was that of a regular sports bar, and the service was nothing spectacular. But the steak and the side dishes were fabulous."}
{"text":"We are from Oregon and wanted a place to go to kill some time before catching our flight. This place was better than expected. We got a beer and a margarita, they were both delicious and the bartender was quick and kind. We ordered the pulled pork nachos and they were so yummy. This is a great place to catch a few drinks and eat. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Ohhh boy!! I write this review with a full belly and a semi sober mind lol. What's not to love about this place!? It's in the mix of any and everything in the city. Tonight it's not packed on a game night and I immediately sat at the bar. Got my drink and sat and talked with my friend. Music doesn't blur and we could have a conversation without screaming at each other. I then ordered my food bang bang shrimp which was great and shrimp linguine which made me want to lick the plate! In an hour or so we're walking to the Spectrum Center to go to the Hornets game. What a great night."}
{"text":"I am so grateful BlackFinn reached out to me regarding my previous visit, which wasn't ideal. They apologized immensely and told me they wanted to make it right. They allowed myself and the 3 others who were with me that night to return for another shot.   We were greeted with kindness and attentiveness. Our waitress was again very kind, personable, and hard working. We ordered drinks for the table, which came out very quickly. The cocktails were very good, and you could tell they were made with quality ingredients. I enjoyed both bourbon cocktails on the menu. The guys got a beer tower haha.   We put in an order for two appetizers- the pretzels and the spinach artichoke dip. These also came out very quickly. They deep fry the pitas for the dip, which instantly makes them to die for. Pretzels were decent.   I ordered the salmon with rice and green beans along with a Caesar salad for my entree. The salmon was a good portion and the Caesar salad was well balanced and delicious.   Lastly, we ordered dessert. The chocolate chip brownie with ice cream was to die for. It may have been my favorite part of the meal. It was nice and warm and the ice cream was the perfect topping. It was plenty big to share! Everyone enjoyed it.   BlackFinn took care of the entire meal for us as an apology for our previous experience. I even had two family members come into town last minute, and I asked if they could join. They took care of all 6 of us beautifully and welcomed us with open arms. They handled the situation with tact. These are good people, and I was pleased and excited to return. We enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Dinner here when there was a home Monday night football game in town. It was busy, but service was pretty good. Unfortunately they were out of the entree my husband really wanted to try as well as some of the draft beers. Ended up with an ahi tuna entree with green beans and lemon ginger sticky rice for me and the bacon wrapped meatloaf for him. Both were good. Took half of each back to hotel for lunch.  Over all wasn't amazing but dinner and service were good!"}
{"text":"I know that there's a blackfin closer to uptown or something but I've never been so my first experience was amazing. My siblings and I were sat down in just a couple of minutes and we got the best server there, her name is Sharma I believe and she was great! she was so funny and recommended some great food. our food did not take too long to come out and it was delicious. I had a bacon wrapped meatloaf with asparagus and it was AMAZING it also came with some sweet potato mash but I just wasn't feeling it so when we brought it to our servers attention she did us a solid and let me choose a side of Mac and cheese and omg was it good. my sisters ordered the jambalaya and the chicken alfredo and those were also AMAZING. I highly recommend this place it is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Had the salmon for lunch with rice pilaf and asparagus.  I was very impressed.  I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Love their chicken tacos. Sometimes the kitchen/ FOH staff is slow. That's the only complaint I have though. Food and drinks are good."}
{"text":"Don't sign up for any of their special events unless you want to be spammed with every single one from then on out. No automated way to unsubscribe and even after direct contact with Taylor Paduch, I'm still on the list after being assured I'm not. Fine place, was cramped, but it was NYE, but Taylor has made me never want to go there again, especially for mediocre, overpriced, spam-inducing events. GET ME OFF YOUR EMAIL LIST."}
{"text":"Terrible. Waiter less than interested. Forgot our appetizer. Shrimp and grits were horrible."}
{"text":"My first visit was surly my last.  An awful experience indeed.  I walked in with a buddy after catching a movie Sunday night.  It was after 10pm and the place was dead.  We were half greeted by an unenthusiastic hostess in some type of white cape.  She led us to a table and seemed confused by our request to be seated outside.    Once outside it took several minutes to be greeted by a server.  We ordered drinks and it took 20 minutes for them to arrive at the table.  I know this because I text my wife as we placed the order and checked the time stamp of the text once the drinks arrived to confirm the wait was as long as it felt.  About 5 minutes after placing the drink order (though they still hadn't arrived) the server came to inquire about our order.  My friend asked a question about an item and she took that to mean he wanted it.  He agreed, but made it clear that he wanted it delivered with my food, but I wasn't yet ready to order.  She said she'd check back in a few minutes.    Moments later another server appears to let us know that she would now be our server.  She confirms my friends order and asks for mine.  He reiterates that he wants his food to come out with mine.  I order the lime salmon something entree.  Three or so minutes pass and she returns to tell me that they are out of lime.  She suggests the barbecue salmon.  Sure.  Another few minutes pass and she informs me that she was misinformed and that it wasn't lime, but in fact salmon that they are out of.  She asks if I need the menu again.  I concur and she fetches it for me.  I quickly call out the roast beef sandwich.  \"Oh, we're out of that.  I'm sorry.\"  At this point I'm agitated and just move to the very next item on the menu:  fish tacos.    In comes a third waitress yelling what sound's like \"T-Bird\" on the patio.  She raced by our table only to loop back and ask us if we ordered this \"T-Bird.\"  We are confused and say no.  She rolls her eyes and strolls back inside.  Apparently she was saying T-Burg - My friend had ordered the Turkey Burger.  Sorry lady, we don't know your kitchen lingo and we asked that our food come out together.  To us that meant it couldn't possibly be ours since I had just placed my FOURTH order less than 60 seconds prior.  Outcomes the first waitress with the plate again.  As she sits it in front of my friend she insists, \"You ordered the turkey burger.  This is yours.\"  She walks away as our new sever approaches.  My friend explains that he wanted his food with mine and she takes the burger away.  Off to the warming window it goes to sit and await the company of my order.  By now our drinks have arrived. When the food finally comes out, my friend's burger has about 12 sad fries on the plate.  He points this out and the server promises more, which never arrive.  My tacos are bland and the fish is mushy.  The drinks, a cucumber cocktail for the both of us, were pretty amazing.  They were the only good part of the entire meal.  Had the server asked, I'd have gladly ordered another.  They were in very misleading glassware though.  A line in the middle of the glass makes you think the level of the drink is either much more or less than what it really is.  At first glance I thought I was drinking way too fast and slowed down.  Not good considering their goal should be to sell more.  Later I thought I had plenty left only to find myself slurping air from the straw.    Towards the end of our meal we had to endure griping from the server about our experience.  It was her attempt at an apology that turned into her complaining about her day and her coworkers, accepting zero responsibility for anything that went awry.  At no point did a manager stop by our table to apologize for the delay or for the unavailable items.  No offer was made for a complimentary dessert or discount off any item on our check.  I didn't even eat half of the disgusting tacos that I didn't even want to begin with.  I left feeling unappreciated and somewhat ripped off.  I'd never recommend this place to anyone, and I have no plans of returning myself."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere. We got sat right away on a Sunday evening. The location is great to walk around after a full tummy. We had the Queen City chicken. It was filling, looked great, tastes great. I like the art in there and they also brought the projection screens down in the main dining room. Also the booths are Large. Price was also good! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is our server was slow. But I'm sure it will be different next time"}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular to be had here.   30 minutes for drink order to be taken.  30 minutes for appetizers to be delivered.   Wife literally had to drag a server to our table to place drink order.   The food was unspectacular. Ordered a simple cheeseburger well - it was delivered rare.   At this point I cut my losses and tried to just pay my tab and leave...yep,  20 minutes later.   As I was leaving I overheard a customer irate that they had placed a reservation and an hour past their alloted time they still had not been seated.  There are too many options in this location to waste your time on unremarkable food and horrendous customer service. I strongly recommend avoiding this place."}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  I've been here before and it has not been like this.  This experience is so bad I feel the need to write.  Facts only:  1. Upon arrival, the bartender did not even smirk. Much less a smile.  Did not greet me when I sat. 2. Squeezed 3 lime slices into my drink and got 2 drips.  DRY is not the word!  3. Ordered 1 drink...sat for an hour and was not offered another drink. 4. Second bartender came on and did not say hello or offer any help. 5. Staff all gathered talking but no one attending to my party or other guests.    Plain and simple...bad service."}
{"text":"After visiting before, we thought this was going to become one of go-to spots for dinner, but they have gone downhill tremendously. Anyone who know restaurants, even a little, can see that cost-cutting is at the top of the list.  1.  Arrived and were happy to see that the patio was about 50% filled, so plenty of seating on a beautiful evening, right? Nope...at 6pm, relatively early for the dinner crowd, there was a 30 minute wait for patio seating. The HALF EMPTY patio. Obviously no staffing to take care of customers.  2.  We were seated right away inside, but walked through the only 50% filled lower level, where we could have at least been near a window (empty booths and tables everywhere), and instead were taken upstairs. Note: the upstairs should be reserved for emergency overflow or private parties with low expectations. Not at all the vibrant, energetic atmosphere of the rest of the place. Normally would ask to be reseated back downstairs, but after the long walk, we just settled in.  3.  Server was very friendly and prompt. Drinks quickly. Helpful with the new menu that had our favorite dishes no longer on it. That was disappointing for us, of course, but in addition, the entire menu had become plain and common...like any other grill in town. Also...chicken as far as the eye can see. Again, looks like cost-cutting across the board.  4.  Ordered the Finn Fries as an appetizer. Took almost 20 minutes to get them, they arrived about 2 minutes before our entrees, and the amount of fries, even for their lowest price starter was embarrassing.   5.  Entrees were good, although the shrimp linguini, which used to be a great dish with large tender shrimp, is now an oily version of it's former self with what can only be described as tiny salad shrimp.   6.  Icing on the cake...we were rushed out by our waitress. Could have simply been inexperience and not a reflection of the restaurant, but to be rushed when the place was half empty and the wait was apparently due to poor management, was incredibly annoying.  In short, looks like what was a really good restaurant that was living up to it's billing and location at a nice place like Ballantyne Village is headed downhill. We'll probably stick to the Terrace Cafe which is always on par, has creative dishes at the same prices and has been consistent for years. #shrug"}
{"text":"We did a work lunch here with about 20 people. This was the first time I'd been here, the place was pretty busy but thankfully we had a reservation.  The service was better that I'd expect for 1 server for 20 people, plus with the rest of the place being packed. The food did take a while to come out but that was pretty much expected with the volume of folks in the restaurant. I always had water in my glass so I was good while waiting.  Someone from the table ordered some chips and dip. I wasn't really in the mood for chips and dip but figured I would at least try one. I immediately regretted that decision. The chip was soggy/greasy and there was absolutely no life to it to give it that \"crunch\". It tasted chewy like it'd been sitting in a pool of grease before being dumped on the plate. Gross.  I ordered the lunch fish tacos. By reading the menu and being told by a friend these were supposed to be good, I was expecting some really good tacos. You basically get 2 tacos and some rice for $11. You can get them fried or grilled and I ordered the grilled ones. When the food finally arrived I was very disappointed by the portion of fish in the tacos and the overall flavor. I know both tacos combined couldn't have added up to even half of a filet. The person across from me even made a comment when the food was delivered, \"Oh wow you are eating very light today, huh?\". The very small bits of fish were piled on a huge bed of cabbage. When I took a bite I literally tasted nothing but cabbage and since the fish was so small only the 1 or 2 inner bites of the taco had any fish. No avocado or cilantro flavor made it through the overwhelming cabbage. The side of rice had a good flavor but I didn't order the meal for the rice, I was really hoping for some tasty tacos and man what a let down. I felt like I just payed $11 for a mouthful of cabbage. What a rip off.  I'm not sure if I would try this place again. Maybe dinner would fare better, but I'm reluctant to try when there are so many other restaurants in the area with better selections.  I would rate lower but the server was good and handled the large crowd very well."}
{"text":"I went here at least 2 times and the food was pretty good. The first time, I had a fish taco and a baby kale quinoa. The fish taco wasn't too bad, it was a little salty but had potential of being really good.The second time I was even better. The waiter was awesome, he had a sense of humor and he definitely knew how to choose wine. My friend and I had him randomly choose a wine for us and his choices were on point. We ordered a blackened brie as appetizer, blackened chicken alfredo for myself, and my friend had a jambalaya. Everything was extremely delicious for the both of us. I'll definitely will be coming here a lot more often."}
{"text":"Got half rack of ribs and they were terrible. Couldn't eat one. They were tougher then jerky. Sent them back to the kitchen and had them removed from the bill."}
{"text":"Extremely Loud outside. There is a radio station or something nearby & the music blared all evening!!  Food is typical pub food but tastes good. Nothing bad to say, but nothing out of the ordinary either!"}
{"text":"When we arrived, no one was there to seat/greet us so we had to wait a bit. The food was okay...I ordered the Tuna Poke ($12) expecting a semi-salad thing but instead got something that looked like a few dried pitas and a tuna avocado dip (see picture). Was a bit disappointed in the small portion but it tasted good. Friends got the chicken something dish and Mac and cheese (the Mac and cheese looked good!)"}
{"text":"First visit. Apps were awful. Food was just okay. Service was horrible. Will not be back."}
