{"text":"Well priced and tasty dishes. The cocktails were fun and the service was friendly and attentive. The room was a little bright for a dinner service but the summer night and lots of windows are an understandable cause. Definitely recommended for a fun night out with friends."}
{"text":"I checked out Wallace's for the first time last night. It was a Sunday night and pretty quiet. I had made a reservation through OpenTable but clearly didn't need it. We ended up sitting at the bar and the bartender was awesome. We enjoyed chatting with him and he gave us some great recommendations including the Smoked Gouda Housemade Sourdough Flatbread. It was loaded with caramelized onions, roasted tomatoes and watercress. And had a balsamic drizzle on it. It was fantastic. Also, if you are thinking about what side to order, make sure you try the Cheddar Stone Ground Grits. Grits are usually hot or miss and they hit a home run with these.   There cocktails are also on point. The Violet Lemondrop with housemade violette and St. Germain was my favorite. Followed closely by the Blueberry Thyme Smash."}
{"text":"This is the most interesting venue in the world (at least in my experience!). Tonight I am listening to Spanish Opera Music...in a bar...with lots of other people! The music is quite good and the emcee is hilarious. I usually come to Wallace's for jazz, but tonight I came out of curiosity and to see my voice teacher perform.   Everyone at Wallace's is friendly. The servers are outstanding. And the food is quite good.   Emcee: \"Who has better opera on a Tuesday in a bar?\" FYI: Tonight the Pens are playing the Caps in a playoff game here in Pittsburgh and this place is packed. With no tvs.   Ok, back to the food. I have had the shrimp and grits, crab cakes, caramelized brussel sprouts, and tonight the smoked salmon quesadilla. I wasn't a fan of the quesadilla but I've loved everything else.   Bapsy the server and Antwuan the maitre d' are both excellent. If you want a fun and interesting evening, head out to the Hotel Indigo and check out this Tap Room!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a late dinner and was super surprised (in a good way) by the live jazz!  Excellent music, excellent service.  Wait staff was super.  I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This is great if you're a traveler staying at indigo! The smoked Gouda flatbread was delicious!   I noticed they also had a fun live music schedule for December mostly on Tuesday/Thursdays!"}
