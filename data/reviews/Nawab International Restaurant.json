{"text":"You get what you pay for in this place.... and the prices aren't cheap. That being said, the food is delicious and well presented. It's a very fair deal- pay good money- get great food. I recommend this place often to friends and family, especially those who tell me they just had the best Indian food- you can't say that until you try out this place. Hands down beats the Host and all those other over rated Indian restaurants. The decor is nice as well, great for family dinners or a date. The staff is attentive and on the ball... very professional establishment."}
{"text":"I like to eat Indian wherever we go, as there is not much selection back home in Oregon.  This place was pretty good.  Not the most authentic, though some might appreciate the menu with pictures and names in English (sag paneer = spinach + cheese).  I would happily go back and try it again.  Had better Indian in Boston, MA and England as well.  I enjoyed everything and we had a lot to sample as there were ten of us.  My wife is the sag paneer fan and she thought it was just okay, something weird about it that she couldn't put her finger on.  Ambiance was nice for a strip mall location, maybe this is normal in Canada.  Attentive wait staff, very slow night.  Some in our party come here often and love it, though being the only party in the place from 7:30-8:30 PM on a Thursday might not bode well for the future of the business.  A couple more tables came in as we were finishing."}
{"text":"This place is good but I find the Indian Kitchen better. More choice and authentic food. The Indian kitchen is located at south/west corner of yonge and center street"}
