{"text":"Avoid the sauces, but the sashimi is cut very well and the sushi rolls are delicious.  specials during the week are worth it!"}
{"text":"First off, Yelp filtered more than 40 reviews at the time of this post. Trust me, you want to read those reviews. If I wasn't so honest, I would have given this place 1 star to make up for all of the filtered reviews, but I would honestly give it 2 stars.  FOOD: Boston roll - Good proportions. Fish tasted good. Dragon roll w/spicy mayo - Not very flavorful. Spider tempura roll w/spicy mayo - Not bad, but not spectacular. Ebi roll w/honey soy - Good proportions and not too bad in flavor. Unagi roll - Don't even get me started. There is no way a restaurant that looks this well-decorated and charges this much to serve something that is so bland and scarce. One piece of the roll literally had a piece of unagi that was as thin (and tasteless!) as cardboard. If it wasn't for a concert that we had to go to afterward, I would have definitely complained to the manager. Simply unacceptable.  Rice was far too mushy for anything worth calling sushi. All of the filtered reviews agree with this review.  Wasabi was grainy for my taste. I've never had grainy wasabi, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and just chalk this up to my preference.  They have nice drink specials, but the one we had tasted very watered down and not strong at all.  SERVICE: At first glance, the service was pretty good. We would have liked them to refill our water a little bit sooner, but the fact that they offered to split the bill for us was a plus (we had a party of four). Unfortunately, as another [filtered] reviewer stated, they had trouble with the cash register. It took them so long that we were actually late to our concert - and trust me, we had plenty of time before we started this hassle. Give them a month or so before asking them to split your bill.  Server didn't know what dishes he was bringing out and had to ask us! Again, give it a month or so and they'll [hopefully] be familiar with their own dishes.  AMENITIES: Restrooms were nice and clean, but the paper towel dispenser in the men's didn't work and the light was dim in the women's.  They have a very nice lounge - well-decorated and an excellent addition to make up for their food.  LOCATION: The only good thing about this restaurant is its location. What a shame!  CONCLUSION: Do not come here for good sushi. You will be gravely disappointed by the flavor, proportions, and cost. If you choose to ignore my warnings and waste your money, at least don't ask them to split the bill and waste your time. Come here to hang out at the bar to people-watch or to hang out near the restrooms."}
{"text":"I am giving it two stars because the bartender was cool. Otherwise this place would only have one star. The sushi rice was really mushy, reminded me of when I tried to make sushi for the first time. I expect better from a restaurant. Overall, the rolls look like they would good based on the ingredients, but the preparation is really poor. Go to RED sushi. Dont go here."}
{"text":"I was walking down State St when this establishment caught my eye. Yes, I do want sushi. The waitress was a little taken aback that I was dining alone, but other than that she was very nice.  I had the spicy tuna roll, which was all right. Not terribly flavorful, but I got it with the spicy mayo sauce, and I am a sucker for flavored mayo, so I enjoyed eating it.   The owner stopped by my table and chatted for a moment. I asked how long the place had been open, and he answered about a half hour.   Beautiful interior and a round bar in the middle."}
{"text":"Me and some friends love sushi, so we wanted to try this place.  Off the bat, the interior was really beautiful.  I love the ceiling and the giant Buddha.  The lighting is neat, as they have candles everywhere (one guy spent about a half hour walking around lighting them).  Unfortunately, the service was horrible.  The waitress started taking drink orders, got through 2 members of our group, and walked away.  We had to call her back so we could all order drinks.  I'm not sure if she thought only 2 of us were drinking of if that's all she could handle.    Eventually we ordered.  There were a lot of options, and it is cool that you can pick a sauce for your sushi.  I had the chef choose for me.  We then proceeded to wait 45 minutes for our food. I've never had to wait this long for sushi.  The restaurant wasn't extremely busy, so I don't know what the problem was.  During the wait I finished my beer and wanted another.  I ordered it from the waitress, and that took another 10 minutes.  They only have bottles, so I have no idea why this took so long.  My food eventually arrived, and it was good.  I had a spider roll and a spicy tuna roll, both were really good.  The rolls were a good size, so I felt like I got my money's worth there.  When we tried to pay, the waitress took only 3 of the bills, so she had to make two trips to settle our tab.  I don't know why this occurred.    Overall, the atmosphere and food were good.  However, the service was absolutely horrible, which is unacceptable if you're paying $30 per person."}
{"text":"What even are you? Why are you reopening as the same place with a barely changed name? Where are all of the normal sane friends of yours who can either talk you out of your fun dream of owning this place or help you make better choices about it?"}
{"text":"Can't honestly say I was impressed. At all. I feel bad to knock them knowing that they're really eager to have a new restaurant on State and that they really seem to be trying hard, but better they know this so they can get their shit together instead of going under.  Ordered miso soup, eel rolls, maki, and drinks. First off, the drinks took forever to arrive. Same goes for refills. Our waitress was new and clearly had almost no idea what she was doing - you think they'd just hire someone with some experience. Cocktail was overpowering and, strangely enough...too sticky.  The rolls were extremely disappointing. It takes some skill to turn maki (cucumber rolls) into something flavorful, but I have seen it done several times before. This was exactly what it was - cucumbers and rice. The cucumbers were Walmart-quality and the rice resembled a watery paper pulp.  The eel rolls were the worst offender in failing to live up to expectations. This was the first time I was trying eel, so I was seeking an adventurous dish that could introduce a new flavor to my palate. Instead I got...more mashed rice. I couldn't even tell you what eel tastes like. The lack of flavor was appalling.  Miso soup was alright. I've certainly had better, and the salt was kind of off. But what I especially recall about it was that it was insanely overpriced. As is everything in this restaurant. A big part of the reason I feel compelled to leave one star is because the gap between the quality and portions of the food and the price I paid was simply unacceptable. I didn't feel like dropping over $100 to get the same amount of food I get for $40 at a better sushi joint, so I left this restaurant about $75 poorer, unhappy and still hungry."}
{"text":"You honestly just pay for the atmosphere here. It's really got a great interior/lighting as other reviews have pointed out. It'd be a good \"date\" place perhaps? The price per quantity/quality is horrible.  A quick note on the drinks : What a joke. Firstly, they don't even have a price on the menu for them. I order a drink that's SMALL. It was a \"martini\" but it was certainly not in a martini glass. It was filled with ICE like you'd get with a rail mixer at a dive bar. So yep a watered down, small cocktail for $9."}
{"text":"Maybe I was setting myself up for a bad experience by coming here directly after seeing Jiro Dreams of Sushi, but my goodness, this was a disappointing experience on so many levels. The only thing about which I have no complaints is the carefully-curated \"atmosphere.\" I ordered one of their overpriced cocktails, which was sorely lacking in booze and took nearly half an hour to arrive. The sushi, also overpriced, took at least an hour to arrive (this was mid-afternoon, so it's not like the place was busy). One of my dining companions was so sick of waiting that she was on the verge of walking out. The rolls place a much greater emphasis on non-Japanese ingredients than I see at other Madison sushi restaurants (such as cream cheese and LOTS of mayo); maybe they were trying to go for fusion, but it came off as disjointed and (as Julia B. mentioned) trying to cover up for the poor quality of the ingredients. The salmon roll I ordered was appallingly dry and required as much chewing as beef jerky. The wasabi was anemic and flavorless. Frankly, I'm not sure how this place is still in business, with so many other great sushi restaurants on State (my favorites being Wasabi and Takara). It seems like the entire budget was used up on decor, with little left over for wait staff, trained sushi chefs, or quality ingredients. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today with my girlfriend.  We were greeted when we first arrived and the restaurant looked very inviting.  We ordered the lunch special (either 1/2/3 rolls with Miso Soup) as well as a Spicy Tuna inside out roll.  Service was prompt and efficient and we received our order with minimal wait.  We were told about the special sauces and that should have been our first warning sign.  While the sushi looked well prepared on the plate, it was utterly devoid of flavor and was a sign of inferior fish (perhaps the reason for the need for sauces).  We received a tuna, salmon, and yellowfin roll as the Chef's special.  As far as the spicy tuna, it was spicy in only title alone.  It lacked heat and the avocado and shredded carrot that was in the roll with it was different.  With the amount of nearby sushi restaurants in the location, I am concerned about the long term viability of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice location, overlooking the intersection of State and Johnson. Trying to be upscale but feels like it was thrown together in a couple weeks. The amount of money they put into it (or lack thereof) does not match the fact that almost everything on the menu is overpriced.  The bartenders struggled serving a group of 5, taking a while on the first round of drinks and never asking us if wanted to order food. After eventually taking our order, they struggled with the computer for 10 minutes and then told us it might take 40 minutes to get the food.  The sake bombs were a disaster, with barely any beer in an awkward cup that trapped the shot glass. It might have had something to do with the fact that the bartender admitted he had never made a sake bomb.  We got our appetizer in the middle of the sake bomb pouring. The tuna tartar looked like carpaccio but tasted great. We drank our sake bombs, ate the tuna, then received another plate for free (screw ups sometimes work in your favor).  The wait for food wasn't that bad, but we got half our meal and half our second round of drinks at the same time.  The sushi was actually pretty good. Everyone was happy with their rolls and they even made the spicy tuna extra spicy per our request.  In the end, they comped us the sake bombs and served us good sushi, so I gave them an extra star and am holding out hope that they replace their bartenders and manager. This really is a great location and I enjoyed everything that came out of the kitchen, but they've got to improve the interior, service, and pricing."}
{"text":"How is it that there are 47 reviews filtered, many written by people with a lot of posted reviews, but that every time the rating gets too low someone with one or two reviews has a positive review posted.  Has anyone ever seen such an insane ratio of filtered reviews?    Read the filtered ones.  These guys have NO CLUE what they are doing and they somehow think they can charge twice as much for the same food that others are executing competently."}
{"text":"Real fast:  1. So dark I can't see my fud. 2. Yikes, 1.5 stars on yelp? Shouldawouldacoulda gone to Red but really wanted to try T Sushi anyway.  I thought the maki rolls my friend and I ordered were pretty good. They were good-sized and well-presented. Nothing spectacular, but I would say they ranged on the higher end of maki rolls.   I wasn't too fond of the ceviche appetizer though. The tilapia tasted fishy and the shrimp looked (was?) raw. I probably shouldn't have finished the entire dish... Hopefully I don't get some sort of parasite from the raw fish.  In my opinion, there are MANY better sushi/Japanese options in Madison. So...make the short hike over to Red or Marumoto for higher grade sashimi. If your wallet doesn't thank you, at least your belly will."}
{"text":"Horrible sushi.  Missing ingredients and no sense to just tell the customer it's unavailable. I ordered an appetizer that came to the table with sashimi on a chip. Huh?  If you're checking yelp already move on to the next sushi place."}
{"text":"This place really is trying. The hostess and waitstaff was friendly and dressed very \"hip\", but waiting 10 minutes for a glass a wine when the place was practically empty is not cool. The place feels like it is trying to be very cool and fresh, but it has the feeling of a place that won't be around long, as it looks like it was thrown together on a budget.  Speaking of a budget..holy prices, batman! The roles were expensive, miso soup for $8? NOT prices that reflected the quality or atmosphere; they should have been half of what they were.  The sushi was interesting (some sauces were a bit different and refreshing), but not as good as you would expect for the prices paid.  If this place is around in a year, I'll be very surprised. There are just so many other good choices in the area."}
{"text":"Hmm, why did Yelp remove the plethora of one-star reviews for this horrid \"sushi bar\"? Overpriced, bad quality fish, nasty, watered-down drinks, slimy owner. GO TO WASABI if you want good sushi, good service, and reasonable prices. AVOID THIS $***hole at all costs."}
