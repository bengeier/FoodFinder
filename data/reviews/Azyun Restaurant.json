{"text":"Such a great fusion of flavour!

The duck noodle dish was insane. I highly recommend this.

Great service"}
{"text":"Came here dinner, table for 2 and we were quickly seated and service was fast and friendly. The decor of the restaurant is very nice and cozy. 

I would definitely recommend making reservations, we got there at 6:00 pm on a Saturday without one, and it seems like all the tables were already reserved. We got lucky because we got there early and promised to leave before the 7:30 reservation arrives. 

We ordered:
Springrolls - bit on a salty and oily side. Tasty but I wouldn't order again 
Beef brisket mantao (daily special) - super delicious, we ended up placing another order
Crab sticky rice - good, recommended
Lamb ribs - bit on the fatty side but the pear salad that came with it was probably the best dish we ate. Might be because everything was so heavy and oily, the salad was the only light refreshing palette cleanser. 
Price: $68 before tips for a party of 2

Overall, food was good but I don't think we will come back because everything was just too oily and heavy (other than the crab sticky rice). If they had some more veggie or salad options, that would be helpful. Felt a bit sick and uneasy after dinner and had to drink lots of tea to calm the stomach down."}
{"text":"Second visit here and it was for a Yelp event. They offered a menu offering seared tuna rice cake, pork skewer, prawn toast, fried chicken sandwich, and truffle fried rice. Everything on the menu was incredibly flavourful ! All the elements of the dishes worked well together. My personal favourite was the truffle fried rice. It had a delicate half cooked quail egg on it. Paired with three different kinds of mishrooms, the rice was to die for ! 

Highly recommend this place if you are looking for some good food at a cozy restaurant , look no further ! P.S. the restaurant manager, Ricky, is super friendly and awesome !"}
{"text":"Great place for date, not so much for family. 
I would skip the sunchoke springroll but I recommend the following...

1. duck confit noodle - pan fried flat noodle with duck confit. A bit oily but heavenly delicious.
2. Truffle fried rice - good option for starch
3. Pork belly sandwiches 
4. Lamb ribs 

We put down 100 bucks between 4 people. It's different Chinese food with a French twist. Service was decent. Restaurant was small with only 6-7 tables so reservation is recommended."}
{"text":"Saw all these amazing reviews so I just had to come here to try myself and it definitely lived up to the hype. 

It's a small restaurant so I highly recommend to call ahead and reserve a table especially on the weekends as they are super busy already!

We've ordered quite a few items off the menu: the truffle fried rice, duck confit noodles, spring rolls, char-siu lamb ribs, fried mantou and tofu cheesecake. Where to start as everything tasted so yummy and was presented oh so lovely.   

The dishes that stood out the most for me was the springs rolls, duck confit noodles and char siu lamb ribs. 

Spring rolls: absolutely loved the filling and it matched so well with its dipping sauce. 

Duck confit noodles: amazing dish, really enjoyed the housemade noodles. You can tell the chef is very attentive to details, as this dish is on a bit of the heavy side so I really liked how the chef incorporated pickled onions to lighten up the heaviness from the sauce. 

Lamb ribs: thumbs up for being so innovative. Who would've known char siu sauce would pair so nicely with lamb?!? and the lamb itself was slow cooked to perfection, very tender. 

Overall: awesome food, excellent service. can be pricey but it's well worth it. Can't wait to come back to try their brunch menu!"}

Rating: (9/10) Food, (9/10) Service, (7/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (9/10) Presentation, (9/10) Cleanliness

My Experience:  

Nice new trendy fusion restaurant with special and delicious dishes. Very fresh take on some classic traditional dishes, but a bit on the pricey side. Reservations recommended! 

When we went, most of the restaurant was still empty, but almost all the seats were saved for reservations later in the night. I would also not come here with a large group without a reservation, as the seating is fairly limited. 

The menu has a variety of dishes, which changes depending if you're dining for lunch, dinner or weekend brunch. Overall the rice and noodles dishes stood out, with the mantou being their star dish, as it is used for the sandwiches, apps and desserts. 

Service is very friendly, explained all the dishes clearly and was helpful with the menu. Restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks , service was great . 
Nice patio 
The truffle infused rice was to die for"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dining experience. Ricky was an excellent server. We had ordered the chicken, ox tonge, pork belly and the finale lobster scallion. Would definitely recommend Azyun to my friends and I look forward to my next visit. Best of luck guys!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars!

Despite this crazy weather outside with freezing rain and such, my girlfriend and I still decided to stick to plan and trek our way here. When arrived, we were literally the only table and we made reservation prior thinking incase it might get busy since it's a small restaurant with limited seating. Ambience is casual/bar style restaurant. 

Staff was friendly and he was attentive. Liked the fact that he made recommendations on the menu since it was our first time. He also told us that the dishes are tapa style so it's meant for sharing (Price point was a bit high for tapa dishes in my opinion). My friend and I both did some yelp research prior so we decided to order the lobster dumplings ($16), fried chicken ($14), and truffle fried rice ($14) to share. 

To be honest, presentation looks good but taste of food was just ok. I feel that it was a little bit on the oily side as I saw the oil dripped off my fried chicken. Fried chicken were juicy and crispy which I like but minus the oil tho!! Lobster dumplings were my least favourite as I didn't feel that it was anything special and I couldn't really taste the chunk of lobster either, texture tasted more like snow crab and barely any in the dumpling. Moreover, I always love anything truffle so the truffle fried rice was definitely the winner for me. It was just the perfect amount of flavour so I highly recommend to try this dish."}
{"text":"Celebrating a friend's birthday tonight and this restaurant is his choice. This restaurant is not really big but is able to fit a large group of us, 14 people. There are still a few small tables on top of sitting our party of 14. I ordered two dishes, 8HR Pork Belly & Snow Crab Rice Toast.

8HR Pork Belly (score 3/5)
The mantou itself tastes good. It's soft and sweet. The pork belly is well marinated and tastes somewhat salty to me. It really surprised me with dressing inside the bun. I found that I had to eat the mantou quick, otherwise it (the mantou) would get soggy.

Snow Crab Rice Toast (score 3/5)
Pan fried rice at the very bottom like a base. On top of the rice toast, there were slices of snow crab, lettuce radish with avocado sauce and mayo and a sprinkle of black sesame. I am amazed at the wonderful idea of the combination of ingredients. When I read the title of the dish, I thought snow crab is the main ingredient of the dish. Somehow, I found the taste of the sauces has overpowered the the taste of the snow crab. 

The restaurant has given me a lot of surprises including the bill. It would be nice if I was informed that service charge was added to the bill already. When I asked to pay with the machine, it asked for tips as well. I didn't know until I left the restaurant."}
{"text":"Tapas proportion Asian fusion. Our group of 3 tried a little bit of everything for lunch and it was so tasty!  The sauce on the mantou sandwiches is a touch sweet. Definitely try there vey fragrant truffle fried rice! The only criticism is the place is small so make a reservation and be on time!"}
{"text":"Was there a few weeks ago. Food was really good and so was service. Their beef brisket pulled pork was my favourite."}
{"text":"Nice new spot in Markham offering unique dishes.

Food: Good taste and innovative menue, fusion cuisine, nice presentation.

- Truffle Fried Rice: must order if you like truffles. Bursting with truffle flavour, semi raw egg on top, marinated cailiflower and mushrooms, a great tasty combination.  Good portion size to share between 2 ppl, but order another bowl if you are with a group.
- Duck Confit Biang Biang Noodles: noodles seem fresh/hand made which was cool, duck was nice and tender, good overall taste. Portion size was a bit smaller than expected, the photos here make the dish look bigger than it is.
- Sunchoke Spring Rolls: never had this type of spring roll before, it's different and I like it.  Good portion size with 4 rolls.
- Cod Fish Cakes with Potato Slaw: lovely fried cod cakes, nice flavour, great pairing with the malt jelly.  Comes with 2 good sized rounds of cod cake. 

Drink: Singapore Sling was good, took advantage of tge Yelp $5 check in special. 

Service: great, friendly. Good dish recommendations.  Does come by to check on patrons and refills water. 

Place: black modern interior, special blackboard menue is nice.  Only issue is that the restaurant is small and seems to cater more to groups. For 2 people, there's only 2 tables or stool seating by the window if they are saving the larger tables for groups. 

Price: decently priced but on the higher end based on portion size.  They are close to Inspire (another one of my fav fusion restaurants) and the portion size there at a similar price point is huge, so something to think about if they are going the 'tapas' route. 

Overall, a solid recommend.  Would come back again to try other dishes and the special chalkboard menue items. A great addition to Markham!"}
{"text":"It's a surprisingly small space, so it's probably safer to make a reservation. We had lunch here and the server did warn us that the food was more tapas style, so do expect smaller dishes. We had the confit duck wings ($11) and the chilli chicken bao ( $10) and we enjoyed both. The dishes were well balanced, the duck wings were really tender and I really liked the fluffy mantou.  The meal reminded my friend of fusion-ized (definitely not a word :P ), elevated dim sum. They also have a nice patio space, so I would definitely want to come back in the summer and try more of their dishes/enjoy their patio."}
{"text":"So pleasantly surprised to find a good asian fusion joint in the neighbourhood. We were especially happy about the fried chicken. Simply saying it's juicy, tender and really flavourful is still an understAtement so you all gotta go there and try it for yourself. Chef Justin, I hope you keep this one up! 

Also tried all three flavours of their Steamed buns and absolutely loved them all, particularly ox tongue. It was a nice medium cut that is tender enough to melt in your mouth. 

The only dish we did Not enjoy wAs the shrimp toast, which wAs a bit too oily. 

Otherwise, greAt job and we will come back for brunch neXt time!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the pork belly man tao! Lots of flavour and there's two per order. I had never tried truffle fried rice before but it was my favourite dish. We weren't huge fans of the seafood noodles - they use very thick noodles and it was pretty tough. I personally am not a huge fan of cheesecake already and the tofu cheesecake didn't do too much for me. 
We were surprised by how small the restaurant actually was but it has outdoor seating. recommend making reservations otherwise my guess is it would be pretty hard to simply walk-in on weekends."}
{"text":"Nice new fusion spot in Markham.
Service was great and food was delicious!
The menu is very simple. 
We were a party of 7 and we just ordered everything on the menu.

Few of my \"must-trys\" include:
- truffle fried rice
- lamb ribs
- sunchoke spring rolls
- cauliflower fritters
- pork belly mantou sandwich

Price was pretty decent.. with everything ordered on the menu + a few drinks.. total was about $40pp including tax & tip.

If you are planning to come as a group, remember to make reservation. The restaurant is small with few seatings available only."}
{"text":"Location/Service
- Right in the heart of Main Street Markham
- Street parking is available and there are some small parking lots around the area. Suggest carpooling if possible, cause it does get pretty busy during peak hours
- Very small restaurant, around 15-20 people seating. There is a patio available to accommodate more guests
- Nice simple decor, like their use of blackboard to promote dishes of the day or new items
- Staff were very nice, friendly and knowledgeable. I like how the Manager were able to provide beers that will match well with each of the dishes

Food
This review will be based off an Yelp Event. The restaurant serves Asian-fusion cuisine, tapas style. 
- Seared Tuna Rice Toast. Good portion of tuna is served over a small bed of toasted rice as the base. I like the Serrano chili that adds in a spicy kick to the overall taste. Didn't taste much of the miso avacado, but still enjoyable. If the rice toast was a little more burnt, that would be perfect!
- Pork Jowl Skewers. One of my favourites - pork jowl is the cheek of the pig, and can do as far to the neck. It's not as fat compared to pork belly, but they have sous-vide into a very similar taste and feel. The Habanero glaze really marinated well and the pork itself was tender and soft.
- Prawn Toast. A prawn that's fried in Panko crust, which is similar to a tonkatsu. The prawn was a smaller than I thought - but the crust itself was a nice compliment together. You can dip it with Nuoc Cham Sauce (a Vietnamese dipping sauce), which also matched well
- Fried Chicken Mantou Sandwich. Also one of my favourites. The kimchi and bun itself were self-made, which are very good. The fried chicken is a soy chili brine that is made for 48 hours! Very tender and easy to chew - matched very well with the kimchi mayo
- Truffle Fried Rice. Interesting mix of fusion cuisines. It's truffle oil used in the dish, which still adds a huge flavor as a whole. I like how they use a small quail egg along with mushrooms that balances out the taste and provide a comforting end to the meal


Overall , I really enjoyed Azyun and kudos on the creativity fusion mixes of each dish. It's a good intimate place to share tapas and chit-chat. Would definitely comeback to try some of their other items available."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant in a suburban area!! Requested fried chicken mantou, truffle fried rice and duck confit biang biang noodles.

Mantou was delicious with warm sweet bread and a little added crunch of veggies. Truffle fried rice was my favorite, not too overpowering with truffle flavors. Duck confit noodles was a touch too heavy... If I were to go back I'll switch it out with a lighter veggie dish.

I had the Shanghai sling which was delicious and my friend enjoyed the virgin version of the same drink. Overall, quaint little asian fusion tapas. Would go back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"I came here recently for brunch after reading all of the great reviews on Yelp. The restaurant is quite small so I would definitely recommend making reservations, especially on weekends. Our group of four showed up about 15 minutes after the restaurant opened on a Sunday morning and were lucky enough to grab a table.

Our server (whom I believe may be the owner as well) was pretty much running around the whole time serving all of the tables. He was really friendly and kept a positive attitude despite how busy it was once all of the tables were full.

Prices are reasonable and portions are decent. I hope they stay that way. I really enjoyed the fried chicken and French toast as well as the snow crab sticky rice which comes with a side of spicy sauce. We also ordered the special of the day - deep fried duck wings in black bean sauce. This is probably the only dish we collectively regretted getting.

Deserving of a solid 4 stars for the food + 0.5 for good service and value."}
{"text":"If there is a reason to visit Markham for dining then azyun is the answer.  

We were served a very modern variation of classics with a bit of their personal touches to truely give us a unique experience.   I promise you that the tofu cheesecake is to die for.

The environment and atmosphere was advertised as integral to the the dining experience and true to their word we had an amazing time.  

The server we had was personable and friendly we felt right at home.  

This is definitely a spot I will visit frequently and I would recommend this place to all my friends as well."}
{"text":"Good quality food and innovative dishes 2.5/5

Deep fried chicken (2/5),oxtail bun (4/5),truffle fried rice (5/5), Tuna salad/roll (2/5), the duck confit noodle (3/5),spring roll (a miss to me,not even finish my piece) 1/5

Worth trying, but will not go back again"}
{"text":"Tried a couple dishes during their soft opening week a while back and they were quite delish.

Here we have the duck confit with biang biang noodles topped with a poached egg, cashew nuts, onions and sesame. It was a dish that was simply done without that 'try hard' fusion approach. Noodles were chewy but on the slightly oilier side with some of it clumping together. Would have liked a bit more duck incorporated into the dish but it was generally a decent dish.

The pork belly bao was also a nice option that you cannot go wrong with trying. Pork belly was well seasoned and grilled perfectly. Pickled veggies balanced well with the slight sweetness of the sauce and the saltiness of the pork belly.

In terms of service, the waitress was attentive and approachable. She also explained each component of the dish as they were brought to the table."}
{"text":"3.5, almost 4 stars

This is definitely one of the more difficult restaurants to rate, as it is better than just A-OK, but we can't say we are fans just yet. The service was warm and attentive and the waitress knew the menu well. 

We ordered the Crouching Tiger and Memoir of a Waitress, and they weren't bad. Like the food at the restaurant, the drinks are also very reasonably priced ($8 for cocktails). I found the Crouching Tiger to be on the sweet side, although I did enjoy the kick from the ginger beer.

As for the food:

MUST ORDER: Ox Tongue Mantou Sandwich ($9) - This was my favourite dish for the night and the portions were good. At first bite, there was a burst of flavours and textures in my mouth, with the soft mantou carrying a slight hint of sweetness, unexpectedly tender ox tongue, refreshing pickled cucumbers, fresh and crunchy fragrant fried onions and a dab of creamy mayo that brings it all together. However, the fixings were unevenly spread, and after that initial bite, I could only taste the mantou and ox tongue, which I found the flavours to be too mild on its own. I think it may have been a different experience if I had paid more attention and made a conscious effort to spread out the fixings so it would be better incorporated into every bite, but I think I was just too hungry that evening! 

Sunchoke Spring Rolls ($11) - Again, the portions were quite good for this dish, as it came with 4 spring rolls and truffle soy mayo on the side.  Sadly, this was a complete miss for me, although my husband liked it. I felt that the spring roll lacked texture, as the sunchokes were pureed and the spring roll wrapper used was phyllo dough, which was more flaky than crispy. I usually love sunchokes, but when pureed and combined with mushrooms, I found the flavour too earthy and it was even slightly off putting, but this is purely based on personal preference. 

Truffle Fried Rice ($14) - This vegetarian dish was very well executed. The rice was perfectly cooked, the cauliflowers had a nice sear, and a good amount of truffle flavour was incorporated into the dish. Although the dish was very balanced in general, I felt like it was missing a flavour burst or some sort of wow factor.

Confit Duck Biang Biang Noodles ($13) - I really enjoyed the texture of the noodles. Through speaking with the waitress, she mentioned that the majority of their menu items, including these noodles, are made in house. I did find this dish to be slightly oily for my taste, and again, there were good flavours in the dish, but nothing really stood out.

Tofu Almond Cheesecake ($7) - We personally love tofu in our desserts. So naturally, the tofu cheesecake was a no brainer for us, although we were really tempted to try the fried mantous with flavoured condensed milk. The cheesecake was more on the fluffy side, and the tofu flavour stood out with a nice hint of sweetness. The blueberry coulis had a slight tangyness to it, which was a nice complement to the sweet cheesecake. 

Overall, I think the chefs at Azyun created some thoughtful and balanced dishes. Although none of the flavour combinations were particularly impressive, with the quality of food served at their current price point, we have no hesitations returning to try out other menu items."}
{"text":"Honestly, just slightly disappointed with the food. I was excited to see another addition to Markham Main Street, especially one of Asian descent. A fun play on Asian fusion, I felt like the food fell short of what I had expected from the hype and raving reviews. 

From the get-go, I was a little surprised by the price which was on the higher end for tapas. The truffle fried rice was pretty good. Strong truffle taste with mushrooms, which was relatively generous in size. The only off thing was how overwhelming the truffle flavour was and how it got kinda gross after a few servings. As well, the cherry tomatoes really clashed in flavour and were off-putting. I noticed a trend of overly acidic/sour salads that were meant to compliment the sweet and savoury feature of the dish. This was true for the lamb ribs which were super tender and amazing flavour but was ruined but a soggy snow pear salad, as well as the fried chicken which was spiced and peppered just right, but was then paired with a poor attempt at kimchi. Definitley the best dish was the buns with pork belly. Amazing flavours and juicy meat, placed into a 

It was a nice restaurant, don't get me wrong. Nice ambience and service. Just questionable combinations of food that try too hard to push that Asian fusion aspect. Small portions at a fairly large price. Try once, but wouldn't make it a regular place to return."}
{"text":"This out if the way quaint place for modern asian fusion cuisine. The setting was small but not crowded. We were a party of 6, we ordered everything on the menu, sharing tapas style. Everything we ordered was good, but no stand out dish. The service was awesome, our waiter accomodated our every request with superb friendliness."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend so my husband and I decided to come here for lunch. It's a cozy restaurant with modern decor. There are a variety of selection (daily specials on the black board, and the regular menu). It's tough to pick since there are so many things that interested us on the menu. We finally selected the pork belly mantou, crab cake, fried mantou, truffle fried rice and rose strawberry panna coda. 
I would say overall great service and excellent food. Nicely done with the fusion element!"}
{"text":"We went to this new restaurant on Main St Markham to celebrate my daughter's birthday. Thanks to Yelp I found this new Fusion restaurant. We were a table of 4 and we shared 6 salty dishes and 3 sweet ones. As previous yelpers have mentioned the food is great for sharing. We tried the Tuna Lettuce Wrap, Pork Belly Sandwich, Sunchoke Spring rolls, Truffle Fried Rice, Duck Noodles and Fried Chicken. My favourite was the Sunchoke Springrolls, other favourites were the Pork Belly Sandwich and the Fried Chicken. The Duck Noodles was a bit too salty and oily. For dessert we had the Fried Mantou with Taro Condensed Milk, Fried Mantou with Apple Cinnamon Condensed Milk and Ice cream and the Tofu Almond Cheesecake. They were all amazing! 
There were 2 servers and they were both very friendly. It was nice that Chef Justin came out to say Hi, he was personable and friendly. He mentioned that they will change up the menu every so often which is a great idea as that will mean we will be going back to try new stuff. I would definitely recommend this new place but it's small so I know that very soon they will have people lining up to get it in."}
{"text":"Went to this today for my boyfriend's birthday. The place to start off is small but since the weather got better today a patio option is readily available. I made reservations for 7pm and had a table prepared with my name on it. 

Sitting down the place had a modern and vintage feel to it and realitively well lit. Its more of a boutique restaurant being it quite small with around two chefs and two waiters. The service was good being everyone was friendly and made sure we were satisfied with everything.

I ordered the truffle fried rice , fried chicken & the duck sticky rice wrapped in leaf. Honestly all the dishes were well cooked with a twist to everything. It was a fusion meal with various combinations of flavours never eaten before anywhere else. I enjoyed all the dishes hard to explain the dishes to be exact...

The servings was of good porportion not too small and not too big. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch today.

First impression was nice atmosphere.   Kinda nice that there is not to much traffic yet but it will pick up as word gets out (like yelp).  Place has been here 6 weeks and they have delicious menu to choose from.

There were tons of delicious options to choose from.   Went with a chicken and French toast (a fan favourite), side of double roast potatoes and a pork belly Bao with taro chips.

Chicken and French toast had lots of flavour.  You get the jam taste from the berries, a nice syrup and Nutella on the bread.  The chicken was nice and crispy and yet very moist.   The smashed roast potatoes had some kind of flavoured mix with the salt and tasted really good.  Pork belly Bao, as long as it is fatty is really tasty with some fresh notes from the slaw and pickled apple. 

Staff here is very knowledgeable and friendly.   Feel free to ask them for recommendations.   Portions on the items greater than $10 are quite large so probably  good for sharing as well."}
{"text":"Fairly innovative and delicious dishes - but definitely not at a cheap price!

Nestled away on Main St. Markham, this new Asian fusion restaurant really makes you wish the portion sizes were bigger! I came here with my boyfriend two weeks ago and we ordered a Duck Confit Biang Biang Noodles and a Lamb Ribs to share. Thankfully, my boyfriend had already eaten because honestly, both of those dishes combined was only enough for a me-portion. (Disclaimer: I won't deny I can eat a lot buuuut I mean, the dishes are definitely smaller than usual). 

The biang biang noodles were very interesting having had an overall soft chewy texture but was slightly crisped at the edges. The duck confit was tasty with fair amounts of meat and I enjoyed the overall flavours of the dish paired with the soft-poached egg. The lamb ribs was a little more hit-and-miss. Of the three ribs, 2 were tender and juicy while 1 was a little too burnt with a sheet of hardened meat/glaze on top. The pear slaw on the side was refreshing but perhaps also a bit too tangy and sour in my opinion. 

Overall, the food was great but with my big appetite and small wallet, I don't see myself frequenting here."}
{"text":"New restaurant in markham woot! Cheers to this new chinese fusion cuisine. Small cozy modern decor - clean & minimalistic. Came here with a group of friends for my best friends birthday. Booked for 12 ppl but ended up almost double in number... however they were extremely accommodating & welcoming. Food was great! Ordered everything on the menu since we had a big crowd and ordered double triple of the items we enjoyed most! Def recommend at main st markham!"}
{"text":"Such a creative and delicious menu, does not fail to impress with intricate flavours. Good food good environment what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Do the right thing and head on over to Azyun Restaurant. 

Know the must-gets: The Azyun Fried Chicken (upgraded taste since the first time going), pork belly mantou, truffle fried rice, tea smoked duck breast and the PORK SIU MAI. 

5 stars x 1000 for customer service if there was that option.

Seriously, do the right thing. 

Thank me later."}
{"text":"Blown away. Not by it's well thought out decor or staff friendliness, but purely by their food. Don't expect a feast, but rather, expect leaving on a full stomach feeling great! I've simply never tasted fried rice or ribs cooked this perfectly. And I'm Chinese. The lamb ribs are a must try, and complemented with truffle fried rice is the perfect combo. (actually we went for salmon but it was unavailable at the time)."}
{"text":"My friend has been wanting to give this place for a try for the past month and I'm glad she brought me along. There are so many great options to choose off the brunch menu and lots of food that I'm dying to try now that I stopped by. We both ordered the Fried Chicken + French Toast. It was delicious! The currant jelly really complimented the fried chicken and French toast which is something I liked. The portions were great as we both got really full after! The Nutella in the French toast was bomb as well. The place itself is so cozy and nice. The service was great too! I look forward in coming here for their dinner menu next time."}
{"text":"I've been anticipating to try out this restaurant after reading numerous good reviews. 

We came as a party of 6, which is a good size as that way I have enough people to try out almost every item on the menu. 

The lobster dumpling was tasty on its own, thin wrapping and stuffed with a good portion of lobster inside each one. The thin wrapping makes it very delicate and tasty. The only thing I did recommend was the broth to be less sweet as it contains honey. Overpowers the dumpling itself. The sweetness of the broth shouldn't steal the thunder of the lobster dumpling. That way, one can enjoy the broth while eating the dumplings at the same time. 

The truffle rice was nicely done, dry but yet not too dried- just right. The noodle with the duck was not bad, except, I would prefer more duck and sauce. The chicken batter biting into it felt a little soggy. We ordered both the jerk chicken (on the blackboard) and the fried chicken. Personally, I was not a huge fan of the fried chicken. 

I really enjoyed the snow crab sticky rice, a good portion of snow crab and went well with the home made XO sauce. The sticky rice itself tasted very flavourful. 

The sunchoke spring rolls were unique. I like the thin batter and the truffle mayo.

I've also ordered the tofu cheese cake, it was pretty good as it has the New York cheese cake texture with a tint of tofu. 

Anyways, overall, good service and a nice little place with good ambiance. Nice new restaurant to try out.Will be back and recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch after hearing and reading all the good reviews. My friend and I tried their eggs benny and duck confit pancakes. 

The pancakes were really good! 4.5/5! I like how they had pears to complement the pancake. The sauce which consist of sesame seed and hint of sesame oil is really nice touch too.

Mixed feelings about the eggs benny. The muffin portion was a bit too hard and I was not really a big fan of the sauce.

Would be interested in coming back again though to try other menu items."}
{"text":"One of my favourite fusion restaurants in Markham! A little out of the way but definitely worth the drive. I had their truffle fried rice and chicken waffles and both were amazingly delicious. I highly recommend both dishes! The cherry on top was the excellent service, Ricky and Justin both went out of their way to get to know their customers which I think is really smart for a new restaurant. Will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"After hearing and seeing other Yelpers checking in. Plus a trip to another restaurant in the neighbourhood, we saw this place and we must check it out. So we browse on the menu and on Yelp to see the pictures plus the reviews. We said, we are coming. 

Got here just before the reservation time. When I first walked in, the restaurant isn't too big. I like that... this makes it more unique compare to a giant restaurant. We were greeted by the host and she sat us down not long after. First observation, the decor is earthy and simple. I like that because there isn't the need to have ostentatious decor. The kitchen is open to the restaurant, so we can hear all the woks and utensils being put to use. 

Time to order the food, and we browsed the menu. My observations were there are only limited number of choices available. I've mentioned before in other reviews, the chef has honed his or her skills into these. We decided to get the truffle fried rice, fried chicken and the snow crab rice cake toast. The toast came first, there were quite a bit of snow crab on the toast. Very fresh flavours and I believe there is sriracha mayo on it. I like the flavour combination. Then the fried chicken came. The chicken was decently juicy. The star of all came out: the truffle fried rice. I could smell the subtle aroma of the truffle. After mixing up the poached egg with the fried rice, we started digging in. Every bite we had, we could smell and taste the subtle aroma/flavour of the truffle. Another plus, there weren't much or even any oil in the bowl, that's a plus in my books. (I've been to too many Asian places where I can see the residual oil left on the plate). Then we ordered dessert: tofu almond cheesecake. I have only one suggestion, perhaps try to use a compote that has a higher citrus acidity to offset the flavour? Just a suggestion. :)

The service was excellent, and we were tended to by the host quite often as she checked in on us numerous times to make sure we are looked after. 

Overall experience is a 5/5, cause I had great food at decent price and great service."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Everything on the menu looked so good. Can't wait to try everything.

Exceptional flavour , texture and attention to detail. Kudos to the chefs."}
{"text":"Awesome asian fusion restaurtaurant.
 
The Sunchoke Spring Rolls were filled with a mushroom paste and covered in a flaky pastry crust.  It's a definite must try and unlike any spring roll I've had before.  You also get a portion of 4 so absolutely worth the money.  

The truffle fried rice was also absolutely delicious. A bit on the oily side and not the largest dish but packed full of flavour.  

The last thing we got was the ox-tongue manteau.  Not a vegetarian option like the other two, but my friend tells me it was quite good.  However probably not as good as the first two.  

Service was also amazing.  

Great place to try, will definitely come again."}
{"text":"This might be my new favourite brunch spot in Markham! 
The creative menu ensures everyone a perfect dish for their preferences. My personal favourites are the duck confit pancakes and pork belly buns. The chicken and nutella waffle was amazing as well, as the chicken was fried perfectly crispy on the outside and moist inside. 

I recommend arriving earlier or making a reservation as there are very limited seats and an even smaller kitchen. 

While it may be on the pricier side, it's still reasonably priced considering the unique choices offered!"}
{"text":"I like how this restaurant is small and intimate. It's great for large groups if you call ahead and make reservations. The restaurant is tapas style so don't come hungry, otherwise it will cost you an arm and leg to fill up. (4/5)

=The menu=
Small enough where a large group can pretty much try everything on there. A small menu also makes sense to allow the restaurant to focus on quality of each dish and change it seasonally. (3/5)

=Food=
The presentation of most dishes were ok. I would have hoped for more in the presentations, given the price point and ability to focus on each dish. (2/5)

Mantous - soft and subtly sweet. I thought it was done pretty well. Both the smoked brisket and pork belly are good. You will have to eat it soon after it arrives, otherwise the bottom bun gets soggy and everything falls apart. I think the smoke brisket could use a bit more pickled veges (as oppose to a single thin slice of pickled cucumber) as an accompaniment (4/5)

Tea smoked duck breast - this dish is their version of Peking duck. The duck breast is done medium rare, but I found it a bit tough to get a clean bite through. I enjoyed the duck more on its own and didn't care for wrapping it up. (3/5)

Steamed duck sticky rice - smokey. Bit oily. Very salty. The XO sauce didn't really add to the dish. It's a good dish, and would have been better if they would have halved the amount of sodium. (2/5)

=Service=
Friendly and attentive. Came around to check up from time to time, so we had our space to enjoy but was not forgotten. (4/5)

=Bill=
Bit on the pricey side but I could live with that. However, sneaking in an 18% mandatory gratuity for a large group is unacceptable. This wasn't written on the menu. This wasn't verbally communicated to us. If you weren't paying attention, you will tip extra on top of their imbedded gratuities, guaranteed. (0/5)"}
{"text":"The benchmark for Asian fusion restaurants; Main St. prices are high, but the atmosphere, service, and food quality merit it so - with the tastiest lamb ribs in Markham leading a concise menu.

What We Got: lamb ribs; truffle fried rice; lobster dumplings; cauliflower pakora; prawn toast
What I Liked: lamb for sure; cauliflower and fried rice were solid
What I'll Get Next: lamb ribs again... duck noodles, spring rolls, and fried mantou to be tried!
What I Wouldn't: prawn toast

Made reservations here for a Friday evening. It was fairly busy, but service was generally fast. Classy exterior, nice interior but a bit tight on space. The homely atmosphere is supplemented by on-the-wall chalk menu specials. They also provided us with a one page dinner menu on a sheet as well.

CAULIFLOWER PAKORA came first. There were 4-5 pieces, and had two mini bowls of different sauces (spicy mayo and a green cilantro/fish sauce one). Small portions but it was really tasty and had a solid crunch. I like that it wasn't over-battered, and you could see the general outline of the cauliflower still. Solid vegetarian option - and I really enjoyed the mayo sauce (and ended up using it with some other dishes too). 

PRAWN TOAST came second. It was not so great. Some pieces were bland, others were overly salty. Bit oily. There are better options. This also came with the green sauce.

TRUFFLE FRIED RICE. Truffle taste was subtle but nice. This one's a bit challenging to share since it's definitely more substantial when you can pull spoonfuls directly into your mouth... But maybe that's just the uncivilized barbarian in me. This vegetarian option was good!

LOBSTER DUMPLINGS were highlighted by a delicious soup. REALLY flavourful and came with a ton of veggies which packed the flavour: asparagus, mushrooms, peas, and green onions. The dumplings themselves were decent, but the soup was a show stealer. And that left...

LAMB RIBS WITH PEAR SALAD. Salad was surprisingly good. Very nice dressing - light but good. Generous on the pear slices. But the star of this dish, and probably of this whole restaurant, and likely on all of Main St...

The lamb ribs.

THE LAMB RIBS WERE SO GOOD. 10 hour slow roasted, they said. Fall off the bone, they claimed.

Yes, yes, and yes. Four pieces. Cherished every single one. Tender. Tasty. Absurdly delicious sauce. 

Value-wise, is that $4 piece? On days where you TREAT YOSELF, yes.

I'm getting this every time I feel I deserve it.


4.5/5. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! The tea cocktails are so  refreshing, a bit light on the alcohol side thou. 
My fav was probably the mackerel and the salad that comes with the lamb ribs. The pickled onion goes really well with the fish. The salad is perfect compliment for the lamb and just so good for a hot summer evening.
Duck sticky rice had good flavoring too. I basically love all sticky rice dishes so can't complain abt anything.
Jowl skewer is a bit too salty and sweet for me, the flavor is very reminiscent of Shanghainese braised pork (hongshaorou). The pear dip thou, loved it. 

I'd definitely go back to check out their brunch soon."}
{"text":"A friend had told me about this place and the photos looked great so I had to check it out!

This is like a tapas/dimsum place that modernized its dishes. Tiny menu but it was still functional.

We had pork belly mantau, fried chicken mantau, and three cup rice.

Pork belly was the best. Yes, it was fat :( but we knew this. I generally dislike pickled veg but they helped balance out the smell of pork. It's two buns per order so it was a tad small but expected.

Fried chicken mantau was alright. Both this and pork belly were good but I feel like the pork belly taste complemented better. The fried chicken taste wasn't as complex.

And finally, the three cup chicken rice. Ugh. This was what brought the rating down. I had honestly thought it would have a Taiwanese flair but it was 95% just sticky rice \"law mai gai\". It wasn't what I had expected.

Service was impeccable but there were only three tables. The owner praised us for making it through the snowstorm so that was nice. Also, they offered hot water instead of cold. I was pretty happy about the attention to detail.

Would I recommend? Yeah but don't get the three cup chicken rice."}
{"text":"Modern Asian Fusion + Bar in Main Street Markham!

This establishment sits in the Heart of Main Street Markham with easy and free public parking on the streets and also back lot.

Once you enter, you are welcomed with a sign with the name of the restaurant as well as a menu item promotion. We were greeted with the friendly staff and offered water right away.

The menu offers limited options in the from $10 - $30 in tapas style food.

They also offer Asian influence mixed cocktails which are worth a try for less than $10.

We ordered the Spring Rolls, Fried Cauliflower, Fried Chicken, Hello Neko and their new mixed cocktail with Guava.

PROS:
- With every served item, the server provided us details of what was in the dish and frequently asked for feedback on the dish, which I appreciate
- Spring Rolls were amazing, with their dipping sauce, it is lightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside
- Fried Cauliflower was fried on the outside and had an interesting flavour once you bite into it, making cauliflower taste much more than crunching on a vegetable accompanied by two dipping sauces, one creamy, the other, fish sauce, highly recommend!
- their popular item, Fried Chicken, coated with buttermilk batter was crunchy, and boneless
- Drinks were unique with an Asian twist than your standard bar drinks
- decor was modern and simple

CONS:
- tapas style food, it adds up
- limited in seating as the restaurant around 4-6 tables and a couple seats at the bar

Definitely would come back here and try their lunch menu!"}
{"text":"I went to Azyun on a whim with my friend and we're both glad we did. We were greeted by really friendly staff and quickly seated. The server, Ricky, was incredibly accommodating giving us suggestions and even recommending me tea for my cold. We got the truffle fried rice, the fried chicken, and the tofu cake. The fried rice was very flavorful and the preserved vegetables was a nice spin. I really enjoyed the tofu cake as it was soft and wasn't too sweet for my taste. Overall, the experience and food was A+ and I would definitely come again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Their menu items are pretty interesting & unique!The braised pork mantou was my favourite. The bun itself had a light sweet taste to it. And Ricky was super nice. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very innovative and inspired menu, went twice in their earlier days. Food is well seasoned and appropriately executed both lunch and dinner. The chef is sociable and demonstrates a high degree of passion for the industry. Respectable.

Cocktails are one dimensional and uninteresting. Even the specials of the day left me with literally no impression.

Must try for the food, but say no to alcohol."}
{"text":"Alright, this review is WAY overdue! I heard you Ricky and Justin! lol

Been here three times during lunch already and each time I tried different dishes to get an idea what they offer.  I tried their Azyun Egg Benny, Truffle Fried Rice, Fried Chicken and Toast and Snow Crab Sticky Rice and I have to say, they are all super delicious and it's so hard for me to pick a favourite!

All these dishes are quite fusion and unique as you probably don't see them elsewhere in Markham or Toronto.  Their Egg Benny uses Fried Mantou as base, which gives it a very unique texture and it doesn't get soggy!

Fried Chicken and Toast may sound simple to you, but their chicken is fried to perfection! Tender and not greasy at all! Pair those delicious chicken with their toasts which has Nutella condense milk filling and Honey Butter Currant Jam, you have a great combination.

Truffle Fried Rice is very flavourful with lots of fresh ingredients and mushrooms and Snow Crab Sticky Rice is great as well! The spicy sauce that comes with it is ADDICTIVE.  Now you know why I can't choose a favourite?!

Last by not least, if you are feeling for a drink, Ricky can make you a wide variety of drinks or even ask him what's his special drink is of the day! I promise you won't be disappointed!

A tip for all of you, reservations are highly recommended as the place is quite small and it gets busy during lunch and dinner time!  I need to visit this place for dinner one day too!"}
{"text":"Totally deserving the High ratings on Yelp. I first noticed this new restaurant on yelp that piqued my interest. Most if not almost all reviews were positive.  Just a few doors down Inspire, Azyun is another welcome addition in Main Street north of markham. 

I tried almost everything on their menu with a group of 5 foodies except for the salmon rice dish because it ran out, which gives me the incentive to go back again and again and again.  Easily shared tapas dishes that u can just order the whole menu except that some dishes are hard to share. Their menus keeps updating so it is always fresh and innovative.

I like pretty much everything from Azyun except one dish, which is the 3 cups chicken. Most people will expect that 3 cups chicken taiwanese dish but this is totally not the same thing. It is a lo mai gai instead , aka the sticky wrap rice. 

My top 3 dishes are: 

Truffles fried rice 
Confit duck biang biang noodles
Ox tongue sandwiches 



Cons: 

small place so reservations may be needed unless you don't mind sitting at the counter. 
Parking isn't that hard but is very limited on the streets.
Or park at green p parking and walk over. 
Can be very traficky to get there during rush weekend hours. Advised to go earlier during the week to avoid waiting.
Since it is tapas, can be kind of pricey but for the food quality of the dishes, it's worth it.

They will be open for brunch starting on March the 10th - alas I can't go that weekend to try :(

I recommend to try this restaurant soon as it will only get extremely busy as good word of mouth spread. It is less busier during early of the week."}
{"text":"This place has the best fried rice (truffle oil fried rice) and lamb ribs I've ever tasted. The pear and ribs, which sounds unappetizing at first, delivers a creative yet delicious palette that I've personally never tasted. The ribs were perfectly tender. I'm Asian and I've had some really good rice- the rice I tried is easy to recommend. It may be a little oily for non Asian foodies, but should be fine for most. The place is small (luckily we were the only ones there at the time)- I imagine on a busy day it could get pretty uncomfortable, but the food and mindful decor easily makes up for it. Portions are perfectly sized, though smaller than most places. Overall, it's an easy recommendation for small groups."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and efficient.
Modern Asian fusion with solid roots in the Asian realm
Tastes are carefully played with with enjoyable flavours. We especially liked the truffle rice, the feature fish and the almond tofu dessert"}
{"text":"Came here on weekday with the mom to see if we'd both like this place. 
What used to be a bar back in the days is now a new fuision-tapas like pan-Asian restaurant
In terms of the ambiance, its simple layout is perfect and making a reservation is always recommended.  
What I liked most about this place was their creative approach to each dish in terms of flavors and presentation which doesn't compromise the quality of ingredients.
Here's the breakdown of what we ordered all of which was a delight to eat! 
Mackerel 
Pork belly mantou
Pork jowl on sticks 
Seafood noodles 
Tofu cheesecake
As for service, there were no complaints as they were helpful. 
Price wise its reasonable for what you order."}
{"text":"One of the best newly opened restaurants uptown.
Been there 3 times and still tastes just like the first time. Really good food and service, I highly recommend to anyone who haven't been there yet."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with my sister- not impressed. 
Service was good, food was mediocre. 

Pork belly buns I think lacked garnish and were a bit salty for my taste. 
The truffle fried rice was pretty good. You can smell the truffle but I think the tomatoes covered the taste. 
Please take the morning dumplings off the menu- they were awful. It was basically a dry italian sausage wrapped in a thick, dry dumpling wrap. On top of that, it was $10 for 4 dumplings. 

My sister has a very small appetite and we managed to finish the 3 lunch items without being too full. Good luck if you have a huge appetite. 

Maybe dinner has better options."}
{"text":"I originally came here because my friend was taken aback by the beauty of the blonde bespecticled hostess-- Fortunately, the food was ASTOUNDING making it worth having to watch my friend once again go through his patented 'I'll just keep it cool by not saying anything to her' moves."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday brunch, after hearing all the rave reviews. This place is very similar to Inspire, carrying a very similar menu. I tried their fried chicken and waffle, and chicken had the perfect level of breaded crunch, but their raspberry sauce, completely threw me off. Overall, this is a nice little fancier lunch or dinner spot uptown, but if you're coming for the food, I think there are better options out there."}
{"text":"New fusion restaurant with great food and service, a must try if you're ever in Markham area."}
{"text":"My wife had seen pictures of this place from her friends and so we looked forward to trying this new spot located on Main St. Markham. 
First thing, the menu is not very extensive and has a limited selection of dishes. Our waitress was very welcoming and asked if we needed recommendations or descriptions of any dishes. We started with the dish that brought us here, the Sunchoke Spring Rolls. Despite the hype, we were pleasantly surprised at how fluffy and tasty the spring rolls were. It was a good start.
We then ordered the Beef and Broccoli (bone marrow), Fried Chicken and Pork Belly Mantau Sandwich.
The bone marrow was not a huge portion but we enjoyed the accompanying rice fritters and matching broccoli sauce. The fried chicken was well battered and very juicy. Again, the accompanying spicy mayo and picked vegetables were a pleasant match. Finally, the pork belly mantau came with two servings. The pork was very fragrant and soft and went well with the pickled cabbage. 
We really enjoyed the food and look forward to trying the other dishes. The wait staff was kind and friendly.
Note: the restaurant is very small and a bit on the cold side."}
{"text":"After hearing great reviews about Azyun Restaurant, my fiance and I decided to check this place out! We called on the same day to make a reservation and got a seat at the bar. Our server was very friendly and we got to watch him work the bar, making specialty drinks for the customers. I'd actually recommend the bar seats for a date night :) The restaurant is small so it's a good idea to book well in advance.

DRINKS:
* Azyun Caesar + a Pork Mantou (bun) - mine (3/5)
I compared this place to Nextdoor Restaurant because it gives me a similar vibe. I enjoyed the ND Caesar (at Nextdoor) much more than the Azyun Caesar because the tomato flavour is too light - it's almost watery. The part that earned its points is the pork mantou, it is sweet & crispy. Very delicious! I'd recommend ordering that on its own.

* Rickards Red - his

FOOD:
* Truffle Fried Rice (5/5)
Okay. Can we talk about how yummy this is?! Firstly, I'd like to mention that I'm pretty biased when it comes to truffle-anything because I love truffle oil infused everything. This was so good! Shout out to the mushrooms because it had the most truffle flavour. The poached egg was a great touch to the rice, it kept the rice from being too dry. I'd highly recommend this!

* Confit Duck Biang Biang Noodles (4/5)
The duck confit was very tender and flavourful. My fiance made a comment about how he wished they added more meat and I made a comment about how they should add more veggies. So you get a mix of what we both prefer on this dish haha. Nonetheless, very delicious - again similar to the truffle fried rice, the poached egg was a nice touch.

* Lamb ribs (3/5)
Here's the difference in opinions - my fiance loved this because the lamb flavour (or smell) was very strong, whereas, I didn't really like that part. This dish is very sweet and very saucy. I could only take one! The rest got devoured by the lamb-meat-lovin' guy beside me.

Overall, I had a great experience here and I plan on bringing my friend here next time!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

Usually skeptical about Asian fusion but this was pretty good, especially for a new restaurant. The space is small. I find the white lighting a bit harsh/bright - good for photos but could be dimmer for better ambiance. 

Fried Mantou (3/5) - they change up the condensed milk every week. We were lucky to have taro that night - my fav! 

Pork Belly Mantou Sandwich (4/5)-  I love pork belly baos. Couldn't taste the condensed mango milk but otherwise a safe, standard dish.

Sunchoke Spring Rolls (3/5) - made with phyllo pastry, this was soft instead of the typical crunchy spring roll. Innovative dish, good with the truffle soy mayo. For some reason I was imagining sunchoke chips, but it's actually a pureed sunchoke filling. Eat it while it's still hot otherwise it gets even more soggy (so I was really a fan at first bite, but when I got to the second one, it was more 'meh')

Steamed three-cup chicken rice (3/5) - sticky rice in lotus leaf with chicken cubes, very strong in soy sauce flavor

Confit duck biang biang noodles (4/5) - housemade flat noodles (a bit slimy/sticky), I liked the soft confit duck and poached egg

Tofu almond cheesecake (1/5) - I usually love tofu cake but this was not as smooth as I like; not a fan of the thick nutty base and pairing with almond butter (a very 'healthy/raw bar' type vibe)

Overall, the dishes were tasty and unique, on the heavy/hearty side. Flavours were good but all very similar, lacking that extra 'something' (maybe some citrus or lighter aspects to balance it out)."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night for dinner. It's a small restaurant with only a couple of tables. Since we arrived after 830 we got seated right away. There was only one wait staff but almost everyone else was done, she only needed to serve us during that time. She was prompt and friendly. We ordered the truffle fried rice and duck confit noodles that everyone talked about as well as the daily special brisket mantou. 

The brisket mantou (2 for $10) was flavorful and the meat was super tender. I really enjoyed it except that the sauce made the bottom of the bun soggy.

Next onto the duck noodles ($13) and truffle fried rice ($14) that most yelpers rave about. The duck noodles tbh was a bit of a letdown. First, there was really little tiny pieces of duck meat that could easily gone unnoticeable. Second, the noodles were lump together. Even though house made noodles can be on the soft side, I still think that a decent plate of noodles should not lump together especially given the amount of grease with this dish. I just don't know how I should feel about this dish. It's some strong flavor but it's not strong in duck flavor(?)

The truffle fried rice was pretty good on the other hand. The truffle smells and tastes good and I especially like the sweetened/pickled cherry tomato that adds extra flavor while balancing the heaviness of the truffle oil. Overall it's a decent dish.

I would not necessarily say that I had a very satisfying meal because when you factor in the portion it is a bit pricey and you will leave half full. However I do appreciate that they have an interesting menu that stimulates my taste bud unlike what I usually have on a regular weekend."}
{"text":"Heard about this new place that opened on Main St. and stopped by with friends after work. We ordered basically everything off the menu: cauliflower fritters, ox tongue sandwiches, lamb ribs, fried chicken, duck noodles, truffle rice, and the dessert!!! Everything tasted great and the service was great. They were so friendly. The atmosphere feels upscale while still cozy. The ox tongue particularly stood out because I've never tried it before but it was delicious. The fried chicken is probably my favorite and tasted great with the jalapeno and horseradish toppings! I am definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Had a very enjoyable dinner with my family tonight, the food was incredible, the presentation was fabulous and served tapas style. The wonderful thing about tapas are that we get to taste so many different flavors. Management was also friendly and made us feel welcome! Luv this place and can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"My exploration of new restaurants brought us to Azyun, suggested by JK. It's a cozy space with seating for about 30 diners (my guesstimate). The decor is modern and chic, very nice.

The menu is small but interesting and they had a few specials for the day. The dishes being served at nearby tables all looked good so it took us a while to settle on the Confit Duck Biang Biang Noodles, Lamb Ribs, and the Crab Sticky Rice (one of the specials).

While waiting for our order, we started with some cocktails, the Shanghai Sling (gin, cherry brandy, orange, lychee, lime, bitters) for JK and Crouching Tiger (bourbon, gin, ginger beer, orange, lime) for me. The Crouching Tiger had a sharp bite from the ginger beer but it was nicely balanced. Checking into Yelp revealed an offer of any bar rail drink for $5 so I later had a Whisky Sour that was also quite good.

The duck arrived first, very nicely presented. It tasted as good as it looked, maybe even better. Stirring the poached egg into the rest of the ingredients blended the flavours and textures quite nicely.

The lamb was also very attractively presented, with the Asian pear salad next to it on a long plate. The meat was deliciously seasoned and tender, probably as a result of being slow-cooked for ten hours. The pear salad balanced the fat of the lamb very well.

The crab sticky rice was wrapped in a lotus leaf and served in a bamboo steam basket, dim sum style. It was a good dish but the crab flavour was a bit subtle for my taste. I would probably try one of the other dishes before ordering this again.

By design, the portions aren't \"meal sized\" but more like large tapas plates. That left us wanting a little more. Hmmm, fried chicken or bone marrow (special of the day)?

The chicken was popular at nearby tables so we chose that. It was very crunchy on the outside and the meat was tender and juicy. It was actually a little too crunchy. The batter tended to crack and fall off. The chili mayo was a nice complement but would have been a more effective dip in a portion cup, rather than on the plate. Nitpicking.

Overall it was a very good experience. The cocktails were on point. The duck and lamb were excellent, while the crab and chicken were very good. The service was excellent. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Trying this new and hot restaurant in markham. It's a very small, cozy restaurant. And you could smell the food cuz it's a open kitchen. We only order the truffle rice and duck confit Noodles. The food is awesome, and the service is bravo. Will return and try some other dishes!"}
{"text":"Braved windspeed of 65-97 km/h yesterday just for food. Also because decent shots were not captured the first time around, so was on a mission to go back especially for that prawn toast! Owner and staff were very friendly and attentive, so the second time around as just as nice.

MENU
Consumed over 2 visits so you're not thinking \"Whooaa! Slow down, fat@$$.\"

[MUST GET! SO DELICIOUS] Truffle Rice $14  - Super highly recommend this dish. Truffles were so fragrant mixed into the rice, but it was the poached egg melded into everything else was where the magic sparked. Only thing that could had been better was for the dish to be hotter, then that'd be next level of black magic f*ckery. 

[Very delicious!] Prawn Toast $9 - The entire \"toast\" was actually pulverized shrimp remolded back into a toast. Found it super neat and tasty. The outter panko layer was crunchy, while the prawn inside was nice and soft; sprinkling sesame seed over it allowed for some nice and nutty aroma. While I wasn't a big fan of the nuoc cham (fish sauce dip), I did liked it a lot better with the spicy aioli sauce for the chicken. 

[Must order for fried chicken lovers] $14 - Batter tasted very light, and some nutty aroma could be detected seeped into the chicken pieces as  whole; fried in peanut oil? SO was impressed that the flesh remained moist and tasted fantastic with the aioli sauce. One thing that could have been improved would to allow the oil to drain a bit on a rack first before serving.

Steamed Snow Crab Sticky Rice $14 - Came out pipping hot from a bamboo steamer basket. It was nice there were generous pieces of crab in the rice. Mixing it with XO sauce made it taste even better. I would have ranked this perfect but just really disliked the flava beans which kind of ruined the flavours for me. 

Confit Duck Biang Biang Noodle $13 - SO liked how al dente the hand made noodles were, but the duck was just very dry and frankly a bit bland. The poached egg again saved the dish, but it wasn't as mind-blowing as the rest. 
 
===

Overall, loved this place, but I did have 1 qualm and that was with the hot water. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out what it was, and then I finally realized it was from the water--tasted like duck or some kind of weird plastic aftertaste. Please please use a water boiler, preferably one where it doesn't give off that taste.

Owner was very kind to offer us cheesecake for coming in despite all the weather warning, but we must decline since we were stuffed to the brim.

Will visit again in the future for that black magic f*ckery truffle rice."}
{"text":"(Visited prior to the new menu.) Really outstanding food across the board, with attentive service as well. Duck noodles are the standout (please bring them back!), with mind-blowing mantou and perfectly cooked meat in every dish. Our only gripes were the fried chicken (a bit too greasy with crust easily separating off the chicken) and a cheesecake dessert overwhelmed by the flavour of black liquorice. Would love to see dessert options further explored. Intimate atmosphere demands reservations. Great new addition, check them out!"}
{"text":"I feel like Azyun is going to be one of those places where it will be quite hard to get a seat in the future. Partly because the space is tiny to begin with! The restaurant is located on Main Street Markham and is located quite close to Inspire actually, which also serves Asian fusion. And the space is just as small, so even now it might be good to make reservations. We just walked in and fortunately there just happened to be enough bar seating for two facing the window. The place itself fits maybe 25ish people, including the bar seating, as part of the space is occupied by what I think is the open kitchen.

Though there was a large party that day, Ricky made us feel welcome and walked us through the brunch menu (which is a fairly new addition), taking the time to describe each dish when it arrived and asking for feedback at the end. Service was excellent and there is clearly passion behind this place and a desire to grow. Asking for criticism isn't the easiest thing to do!

The food: we ordered the Azyun eggs benny and fried chicken + french toast. Prices and portions are on par with what you might get downtown - $17 and $19, respectively. We left decently full with room for dessert. I think Inspire has slightly bigger portions. I know this place is for tapas, but I think the brunch menu is more like individual meal portions.

The poached egg was perfect in the eggs benny and what makes it unique is that it comes served on Chinese mantou. Their reasoning is that it's not quite as heavy and dense as an English muffin (true). It comes with double roasted potatoes (and they give you a lot of potato, perhaps to make up for how filling an English muffin is). Solid dish.

The fried chicken is brined overnight and was very flavourful. Super crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. It comes on top of french toast filled with nutella and condensed milk with a blackberry coulis on top and honey butter on the side. Separately, these things were delicious (the nutella was a little heavy for me but that's personal preference). Together, they weren't unpleasant but chocolate and chicken is a bit of an odd combination... it wasn't a bad combination though! Perhaps something to make the dish feel a bit more cohesive would be a good addition though I'm not sure what that might be.

Overall, I think the flavors for these brunch items were balanced and more subtle than Inspire, which I like. I would come back to try more items! Markham really needs more places like this instead of chain restaurants... I hope they do well and continue to leave room to improve."}
{"text":"Came to the restaurant tonight and was looking forward to try it out based on all the reviews. Definitely encourage reservations as it is quite a small restaurant opened 2 months ago, they had to turn away walk ins as most tables were reserved. We tried the truffle fried rice, which I found good, but not spectacular. It seemed like it was lacking something, it had mushrooms and you can taste the garlic, but could barely taste the truffle.  The duck confit noodles were okay, we were a bit disappointed as it was quite oily and the grease turned me off. There was not a lot of noodles so it was hard to say that it was a noodle dish, my husband said it seems like it doesn't know what kinda dish it wants to be.  The fried chicken was good, but we can taste the flour on the batter. Maybe it was what we choose, but it seems like this restaurant was trying a bit too hard. We actually like Inspire restaurant a few doors down a lot more, the portions here were quite small compared to Inspire.  I think if instead of making mantou buns, steamed buns will be a lot better!  Anyways, I guess it is a good addition restaurant to Main Street Markham."}
{"text":"Azyun is definitely a place to check out. It's the newest addition to this area but definitely give a try because the food here is on point. 

March 10 - was the first day where they offer a brunch menu and I was impressed. The menu offers a variety of dishes which are shareable and perfect to try in a small or large group setting. If you're planning on dining here, make a reservation especially for dinner; it's a small place but lives up to it's newfound hype. 

My Mom and I came here for lunch, we took awhile to decide on what to order as everything on the menu sounded delicious. We ordered the following dishes: 
* Truffle Fried Rice 
* Morning Dumpling 
* Lobster Dumpling 
* Steamed Snow Crab Sticky Rice 

The Truffle Fried Rice was ah-mazing! It was very fragrant and after the first bite, it got even better. I especially enjoyed the different textures and how each ingredient complimented one another. 

The Morning Dumpling was something new and different, usually I'm not a fan of dumplings but this was unique. The tomato jam added an extra touch to the overall flavours. 

The Lobster Dumpling was refreshing, the combination of lobster and shrimp - it was a good bite and the broth was light but had good subtle flavours. 

The Steamed Snow Crab Sticky Rice (this takes about 15 mins for prep but entirely worth it!). We enjoyed this as our last dish but it was delicious. The portion was perfect for sharing and sauce it came with completed the dish. It gave the dish a good spice and the rice was steamed perfectly. 

Overall, my Mom and I enjoyed our experience at Azyun this past weekend. A huge thank you to Ricky for being so accommodating and kind. He explained each dish thoroughly and came back to check on us many times as well. You can clearly feel his passion for the restaurant and food. I definitely recommend coming to check out Azyun as I will definitely be coming back to try out the rest of the menu (including the dinner menu)."}
{"text":"Frist visit there didn't know what too expect but very pleased with the food and service. It is a very small place and eould have to wait for a table for about 15 to 30 mins."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service! The duck confit noodles were my favourite. The truffle fried rice was very nice too. My table ordered two plates of the fried chicken cause we really liked it! I tried Ox tongue for the first time and it was surprisingly good! The pork belly bao was also one of my favourites."}
{"text":"I've been to Azyun twice and both times, I've had such a wonderful time.  The food here is awesome but here are my top 5 must gets: 

1) Truffle fried rice - absolutely must get.  The truffle flavour is definitely apparent in this rice and the cherry tomatoes and mushroom compliment this dish nicely. 

2) Pork skewers - Oh this was fantastic.  I had this at a Yelp event and I wish I had known about this much much earlier.  I could eat a million of these :) 

3) Fried chicken - MUST get.  It's crispy to perfection and the kimchi is so nice with it.  I don't know how to describe this fantastic dish except that you've GOT to get it.  

4) Seared tuna rice cake - it was delicious with a fantastic punch of spiciness.  The rice cake complimented the seared tuna as well and what would make it even more fantastic is if the rice cake were a little more crispy.  

5) Mackerel - if you are a fish lover, you'd have an appreciation of this mackerel.  What I loved about it is that it was already deboned (big brownie points).  It was grilled to perfection and just a great dish overall. 

The servers here are very friendly and they make awesome recommendations.  Ricky the manager is also very personable and friendly.  I would most definitely come back to Azyun for more great eats!! :)"}
{"text":"A couple of my yelp friends recommended this restaurant to me, so I decided to come for brunch with some friends. We ordered four items to share: Fried Chicken French Toast with Nutella, Pork Belly Mantou, Truffle Fried Rice and Duck Pancakes. I really like the duck pancakes as the duck is actually mixed into the pancake and the batter is a bit sweet like HK egg waffles. My friends liked the Fried Chicken French toast the best. I couldn't really taste the truffle in the truffle fried rice. Pork Belly Mantou was our least favourite because we didn't think the flavours go together."}
{"text":"When I first saw the menu, location and photos, I thought...this place reminds me of Inspire next door. But I was so impressed when I went for brunch, my friend and I couldn't stop listing things that Azyun is BETTER than inspire.
It's a small little restaurant that replaced the old horrible burger place on Main St. The restaurant is cozy and modern, very fitting for the menu. I also appreciate how they automatically serve hot water instead of iced given it to be a cold day.
Waitress was very pleasant and attentive; she also had great awareness of the menu so could readily answer our questions and make recommendations.
For brunch, I got the french toast with a side of fruit and my friend got their little breakfast.
Everything came promptly and was beautifully plated. My french toast was delicious with the nutella, honey butter & berry compote. Some pieces were slightly charred but the inside was still fluffy. My fruit plate was mint and honey marinated and was delicious, I felt it was slightly small for the price but it went well with my french toast.
My friend's plate was also delicious. It was convention breakfast food, but everything was done perfectly and portions were great.
I do find their pricing on the menu very \"off\" in conventional standards. Some items seem obviously underpriced and a steal when you see the end product; but others having pricing that just boggles your mind when you see how underwhelming it is. (For example - My delicious full size french toast was $6 and a bowl of oatmeal was $11)
We are very excited to return for dinner and brunch to try their regular menu that everyone raves about."}
{"text":"Big shout out to Ashley our server and the kitchen crew. There are 13 items on the menu and my husband and I shared 7 of them. Everything we ordered was delicious and a great modern twist on Chinese cuisine. Great atmosphere and Ashley is warm and welcoming. Dishes came out quickly thanks to the kitchen staff. We ordered the spring rolls that were wrapped in phyllo pastry for a nice change, lamb ribs nice and fatty, truffled rice, pork belly mantou, tuna lettuce wraps really fresh and for dessert fried mantou and tofu cheesecake. We loved it all and we're actually going back next week!"}
{"text":"I believe this is a relatively new restaurant in the area. I came here with a group of 7 on a Saturday night and we ordered quite a few dishes to share, including fried mantou (2-3 orders so each person got 1), tuna lettuce cup, fried chicken, truffle fried rice, lobster dumplings, steamed snow crab sticky rice, and confit duck biang biang noodles. The fried mantou was similar to what you can get at a Shanghai restaurant but it came with avocado condensed milk on the side, which was very interesting and I personally love avocado! The fried chicken was really crispy and we loved that the chicken was marinated before frying  The truffle fried rice was my favourite - surprisingly the truffle flavour went very well with fried rice.

They have quite an extensive beverage menu. We each ordered a cocktail/beer and they all had very interesting flavour combination (but on the pricier side).

Overall, we loved the taste of the dishes we ordered but the portion was too small. We didn't feel very satisfied/full and kind of expected more for the price we paid. I want to come back again but hopefully they increase the portion in the future."}
{"text":"I am always on the hunt for innovative food and this place hits the spot! The dinner was so good that I came back for brunch the next day. 

MEAL HIGHLIGHTS:

1) FRIED MANTOU ($4) a deep fried bao served with a special coffee-infused condensed milk  sauce. That sauce was TO DIE FOR!

2)Highly recommend the TRUFFLE FRIED RICE ($14) It was absolutely delicious and filling!

3)FRIED CHICKEN AND NUTELLA FRENCH TOAST ($19) I don't even need to write about this. Think about this combo, book a reservation and try it out for yourself! 

On top of ALL that...we also got amazing service. Thank you Azyun for such a wonderful experience, I hope I get to be a part of Yelp Elite so that I could  try out the alcoholic bubble tea coming out next month!"}
{"text":"A tiny restaurant that comes with a small variety of menu to choose from, but the food is super awesome! Came here with a group of 8 people for dinner on Friday. We ordered 3 lamb ribs, 2 fried chicken, 2 truffle fried rice, 1 steamed three-cup chicken rice, 1 spicy lamb noodles, 1 sunchoke spring rolls. Everything we ordered was great, only the steamed three-cup chicken rice is a little bit too salty. The lamb is nicely cooked and the truffle rice is probably my favorite. However, the portion of them is quite small, everyone might not even get a bite of it, probably we need to order way more to be full for everyone. Definitely I will visit again, but maybe not in a big group but 2 people haha."}
{"text":"Loved my dining experience. The food was great and you can tell the chefs really put thought into the dishes. Prices were good and portions are tapas sized, so it's you can get a bunch of food and share amongst the table. Their house cocktails also looked AMAZING so I will definitely go back to try them."}
{"text":"Visited here on a Saturday night not knowing it was best to have a reservation. I opted to sit at one of their bar areas which was perfectly fine.

The restaurant has a smaller selection of options but I wanted to try almost all of them! Between my mom and I, we tried their Duck Confit Biang Biang noodles, Sunchoke Spring Rolls, Ox Tongue mantao and Tofu Almond cheesecake. 

The highlight for me was definitely the noodles. The combination of the duck, mushrooms and noodles were delicious. I've also never had noodles like the ones served here but I absolutely loved it!

The service was also excellent and our server Ashley was super friendly and helpful with the menu. 

I'm excited to give them another try for lunch as they have a different menu. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great new place! Super cozy with good food and fun cocktails! Great date spot, or brunch on a beautiful day outside on their patio!"}
{"text":"Unique food with new world flavours. Awesome creations and each dish carries a unique characteristics either in flavour and appearance. Service was great and store is comfortable."}
{"text":"A little over priced for the quality and portion. 
We pretty much ordered  everything on the menu as the portion for everything was very small. We liked the  truffle fried rice but a little too oily. The belly bun was good too. The rest was okay."}
{"text":"My brother and I took my mom and grandmother here for Mother's Day. We made reservations for 8. I found out later that they closed at 9 but it's a good thing that we eat quick. The food made it easy for us to do it though. Our waiter spoke Cantonese so it was great because my mom and grandmother barely speak English. It was a fusion restaurant so a bit of the familiar mixed with unfamiliar made for a great experience.

It's quite a small restaurant with not a lot of seating. Some may feel it's cramped but it wasn't a big deal.

We pretty much ordered half the menu. I order all 3 steamed mantou sandwiches, pork jowl skewers, confit duck wings, tea smoked duck breast, torched mackerel, fried chicken and lamb ribs.

Out of the 3 sandwiches, I'd have to say that the brisket and pork belly were on par with one another and the chicken one was just alright. The former two were very flavorful. Each basket comes with two sandwiches.

I think I enjoyed the pork jowl skewers the most. Just the right amount of fat for the tenderness plus it was both sweet and spicy on top of that.

I thought the duck wings were okay. I'm used to trying the duck wings from the local grocery store and they didn't taste that much different. Not sure if I'd order it again or if I got good value.

When it came to the duck breast, it didn't seem that different from the smoked duck breast that you get from the store. It just might seem like a thing regarding duck at this point. This was the most expensive thing on the menu so I expected a bit more.

The torched mackerel was worth it. It was tangy as most mackerel are and we spent a lot of time eating it. They said it was boneless but I found a bone here and there so be careful.

I don't really remember how the lamb ribs were so... I'm just going to say forgettable. Might have to order it again to see if they actually were.

The fried chicken here was awesome. They gave us a lot and it was extremely crunchy. It was good by itself but even better with the hot sauce. The kimchi was a bit random but I like kimchi.

My brother and grandma enjoyed it but my mom loved it. She was so busy eating, she didn't even have time to talk. I think the bill came up to $150 for the 4 of us. So, it was a bit on the pricey side but I'd still come back after saving a little or maybe I just won't order too many expensive items."}
{"text":"We saw this place opened up recently and decided to give it a try. It's located in quaint little downtown Markham, surrounded by other nice shops and homes. The restaurant is very small on the inside - only perhaps five or six tables (so make a reservation).

It definitely has a trendy, \"uptown\" kind of vibe: hipster ingredients such as truffle mushrooms, sunchoke, and lotus leaf; mash-ups of familiar foods with unexpected twists, such as \"beef and broccoli\" but with bone marrow, or cheesecake but with tofu; an eclectic cocktail menu; and walls decorated with lucky cats, Polaroid pictures, and \"#AZYUN.\" The restaurant also has a feeling of intimacy, as if you're just eating dinner at your aunt and uncle's house. The chef's name is on the menu, and you can watch him cook from your seats. And the waitress struck up friendly conversation and cracked some jokes, but in a \"we're just chillin'\" kind of way, not in a rehearsed, \"I'm trying to make you like me\" kind of way.

The food itself was quite tasty. We enjoyed the pork belly manitou and the lamb ribs the most. The duck noodle and the beef + broccoli were also quite good. We finished off with the tofu cheesecake for dessert. Remember that this is a tapas restaurant - the idea is to order multiple small plates to share. I'd say most dishes are sized to be shared amongst two people - but we made do sharing them amongst the three of us. Also, a good rule of thumb is around 2 dishes per person in your group (e.g. if you're coming with just your spouse, the two of you could split 4 dishes).

A few small things detracted from the experience. Firstly, the service was a bit slow, which caused the meal to drag on longer than we wanted. In fact, I think the waitress forgot about some of our orders for a while. Secondly, since the restaurant is so small (and since we didn't have a reservation), we got a less-than-ideal seating arrangement at the high-top by the window, where it was a bit more awkward to interact with one another (although, of course, we appreciate getting a table in the first place, rather than being turned away). And lastly, the restaurant got a bit boisterous: at times there were kids crying, parents whistling, and people shouting. Nothing was a deal-breaker, but these things made the overall experience just good instead of great.

On the whole, we had a fun time. It was nice to check out this new restaurant, and we hope they do well!"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 3/5
This place is located on Main Street Markham Rd and Bullock Dr. There were a couple parking spots on the street, but I would suggest parking in the parking lot on Wilson St. 

[SERVICE] - 5/5
Our server was personable and friendly. She made suggestions from the menu throughout the night and frequently checked on our table. 

[DÉCOR] - 4/5 
Modern but small and cozy. There weren't that many tables, so I would suggest making a reservation for groups of more than 4 people.

[QUALITY] - 4/5
The flavours within each dish complemented one another very well, and all ingredients were high-quality. The menu also changes quite often, I assume 

[ORDER] - 4/5
- Confit Duck Biang Biang Noodles - $13.00: savoury and noodles were perfectly cooked, I believe the noodles were homemade as well. Unfortunately, there wasn't that much duck confit in the dish. 

- Lamb Ribs - $16.00: tender and the sauce had the perfect amount of sweet and savoury. 

- Fried Chicken - $14.00: chicken skin was light and crisp. Chicken meat was juicy and soft.

- Truffle Fried Rice - $14.00: aromatic with the scent of truffle oil

- Steamed Snow Crab Sticky Rice (takes 15 mins to prepare) - $14.00: the flavours blended perfectly with one amother. There weren't that many pieces of snow crab in the rice but pieces tasted pretty fresh. 

[OVERALL] - 4/5
Definitely a great place for tapas. The items on the menu are quite pricey in comparison with other Asian restaurants, but pretty normal for this type of food. Every dish was multidimensional and made with high-quality ingredients. I would recommend this place for their delicious Asian Fusion tapas."}
{"text":"This is a new Asian fusion spot on the quaint little street of Main Street Markham. The decor is fairly modern and well put together, however there are not a lot of seats. Dined here with two girlfriends on a Thursday night so we were able to snag a table at 7:30 without waiting. For a spot that just opened a month ago, the place was fairly busy. 

The concept is Asian fusion. It is a fancy type of Asian fusion since they have things like truffle and duck confit on the menu. If you're someone looking to impress a foodie, you must come to Azyun!

The server was very friendly and gave us recommendations and menu specials. Overall the concept is tapas style where you share multiple dishes. I wouldn't say this is an izakaya either because the servings are bigger than an izakaya. We ordered the truffle fried rice, duck confit noodles, fried chicken and mantou bun. The truffle fried rice smelled like perfection and came with a generous serving of different types of mushrooms. Duck confit noodles were also very flavourful - barely tasted the duck but the combination of ingredients were awesome. The fried chicken also came in a generous serving - quite good for sharing. Plus, it came with pickled veggies that were an excellent complement to the perfectly fried chicken!

Our bill came up to be $45 which was pretty good for a group of 3 people! Our server was very attentive, always checking up on us and refilling our water every chance he got. 

I would definitely come back to bring my other foodie friends to this spot. Happy to have tried and looking forward to seeing new menu items!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family on a Sunday morning & ordered a wide variety of dishes from Azyun. My favourite dish was the fried chicken with French toast. Great vibes and amazing food all around, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Sunday night. I'm glad I came with a group of 4 so we could try a lot of things on the menu. I find this place more of a tapas place, ordering a few things to share as opposed to ordering one dish to be your main.

Tuna lettuce wrap ($13)
Seared tuna served on mashed avocado in fresh piece of lettuce, topped with some tempura pieces. Ingredients were fresh. This tasted really refreshing, a great appetizer. 

Sunchoke Spring rolls ($11)
This vegetarian spring roll was delicious. A flaky phyllo stuffed with a king oyster mushroom filling. Really tasty! The filling was super rich in mushroom flavour. This spring roll texture was more on the flaky pastry side rather than being your typical crispy spring roll. 

Lamb ribs ($16)
These braised lamb ribs were glazed in bbq pork sauce, served with a super refreshing pear salad on the side. The lamb ribs meat were really tender, outside edges had a nice crisp. Because the meat was rich in flavour, having the pear salad on the side was really refreshing.

Truffle fried rice ($14)
This was my favourite dish of the night! Vegetarian fried rice mixed with mushroom, cauliflower, and truffle topped with a poached egg. The fried rice was cooked nicely, strong in flavours. Words or pictures don't do the justice but this dish was definitely delicious!

Fried Chicken ($14)
The chicken is marinated overnight in a bunch of ingredients prior to being fried the next day. As a result, the chicken meat itself is flavourful and doesn't rely on the flavour from the fried batter. The fried chicken was super crispy, and didn't feel oily or greasy at all. Not going to lie it did remind me of Popeyes. 

Duck Confit biang biang noodles ($13)
My second most favourite dish of the night. I swear there was more duck meat and mushrooms in this dish than the noodles! The noodles are made in house. I really liked the flavour of the sauce, more on the saltier end. The duck meat was tender. All ingredients went really well. Tasty!

Black sesame bread pudding ($8)
The black sesame bread pudding kinda tastes like a combination of \"man tao\" and \"ma lai go\" (chinese dimsum dessert) but with a hint of black sesame flavour. The texture was more dense, not soft and fluffy like normal bread pudding. The bread pudding was served with homemade caramel sauce and topped with ice cream. It was different, but I liked it!

Tofu cheesecake ($7)
This dessert was completely made in house. The crust had a lot of mixed crushed nuts. There was a strong tofu flavour but I personally prefer having more cheesecake flavour. 

Love the decor, nice and cozy place. Be sure to make reservations though, the restaurant can seat around 20 people.
I will definitely be coming back to try their other items!"}
{"text":"we ordered the spring rolls, cauliflower fritter, fried chicken, pork sandwich, truffle fried rice and bao. I recommend ordering duck noodles it was so delicious that we had to fight over the dish. Everything was so delicious we were licking the plates by the end. Price was more than reasonable and the service was great I will visit again for sure."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of visiting Azyun for their soft opening, and their service was welcoming and attentive, which was amazing for such a busy night. The restaurant is modern with a cozy atmosphere - great for both a date night or casual night out with friends. We ordered the sun-choke spring rolls and duck confit noodles and both were delicious. The vegetarian rolls were crispy and light, while the noodles were full of flavor. All the dishes on the menu seem creative and unique, my only regret is not being able to eat and order more. I will definitely be back to try the other items!"}
{"text":"The one expectation I went in was that I was going to pay quite a bit of money for not-as-much food; such is the realm of tapas sometimes. That expectation was pretty much shattered upon leaving. 

The service was very friendly and attentive, and went above and beyond as to explain what each dish contained, without compromising the secret ingredients :) The two biggest dishes left on my mind and palate were the sunchoke spring rolls with roasted truffle mayo, along with the almond tofu cheesecake with blueberry ginger compote and almond butter. The spring rolls defies the regular image of a spring roll using phyllo pastry, which also complimented the sunchoke filling. The roasted truffle mayo gave a nice umami kick to the spring rolls.

The tofu cheesecake was light, fluffy and not too sweet, to my delight. the blueberry ginger compote helped to alleviate any heaviness (if any), from the cheesecake, ending the meal with a very pleasant high note.

Yes, you will be paying around $11-30, but... the service, the experience, and most of all, the food makes it all worth it. They are set to unveil a new menu very soon, so keep an eye out!"}
{"text":"What my wife and I had to eat: Truffle Fried rice, Pork belly sandwich, and Duck wings

The taste of the truffle fried rice was so full of flavour and we had not taste anything like this before, amazingly tasty. The duck wings were was so nice and unique taste with a wonderful presentation. What can I say about the Pork belly sandwich, it was truly unique and light with wonderful flavour.

The setting of the restaurant: small but very nice seating and decor is modern with a unique cool twist which makes this restaurant a great place for a date night.

Overall thoughts: I Highly recommend this place and will come back again to try the many other unique dishes, can't wait!! Will go again soon on another date night with the wife."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first because I didn't want to go to another Asian-Fusion restaurant that is overpriced and overrated. Well, clearly I was wrong. Everything here was absolutely delicious! My favorites were the manitou sandwiches (get the 8hr pork belly!!!) and the truffle fried rice. The drinks also quite good and their names are quite playful. In fact, if you grew up in Hong Kong in the 90s and early 2000 you'll definitely appreciate the inside jokes. 

In any case, yes, fo visit this place! And yes, I am definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Had a GREAT server -Ricky- who was very quick, efficient, and fun. Will return just to have such great service. 
The food was so amazing - Bao (pork) Shiami , and Smoked duck confie. Wish we took more pictures as it was so tasty and rich. 
The place is small but very trendy and worth the traffic and waiting to get a table. 
Worth coming back to as we visited from the states - Los Angeles"}
{"text":"Had very interesting things there. Very creative and fusion food. Hopefully the portion can be bigger. They continue to have new dishes which makes me want to go back and try them.
Staff and service is good.
Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Quite disappointed. The portions were too small for the price. Taking into consideration that it's a fusion cuisine, the taste and flavours don't come together very well and there isn't anything too special that you can't find at other places that could probably do better. Our small party's bill came to a total of $78 (4 dishes and 2 sides) and we were all  discontent with our meal, enough that we went elsewhere for another meal right after.  Nothing wrong with the service, but sorry, not sorry."}
{"text":"Super delicious food, very attentive service. Definitely will be back. I came here for a spontaneous dinner with a friend one night, it was early in the week so not many people in the restaurant. Waitress was very friendly, seemed to know her stuff, and was quick and efficient in serving food. 

I wanted to order the lamb ribs but according to the waitress, it's a super popular dish which was sold out the day before. I was a tad bit disappointed to hear that, especially with news of such raving success. Instead, I ordered the ox tongue mantou and the pork belly mantou. Now, I don't normally eat pork but due to everyone and their mom's recommendation, I caved in. And as usual whenever I eat pork, the taste was just downright gross to me. But don't take my opinion for them; my friend who ordered the same dish expressed his fondness for it. The ox tongue mantou though, that stuff was amazing. I should've just skipped the pork belly for another order of those. The meat just melts on your tongue. Super delicious. These are a must try!

I also ordered the truffle fried rice. Also a must try! It is really delicious but my only gripe about it was how oily it got towards the end of it. My friend who got the duck noodles expressed in similar agreement. It would be nice if less oil was used in their cooking. 

Over all, very neat restaurant. Albeit a little cramped, there's very few tables, only about four, and a few chairs at the counters and bar. I can see this place becoming busier on the weekends so a reservation is a must before coming here!"}
{"text":"Brought my mom here for an early mother's day dinner. The staff are friendly and the ambience is nice. I really liked the food, it was very unique. I'd post photos but my camera really didn't do it justice. We ordered 3 dishes and the portioning was perfect to share between 2 people. I recommend the brisket sandwich and lamb ribs as their meat is very tender. The flavors of every dish were very well paired. A bit on the pricey side but I definitely want to come back and try more."}
