{"text":"As I was getting my wheels checked during my lunch break I began to look around for a place to grab some lunch. I knew I didn't want a burrito so I ignored the taco shop on the corner. Definitely didn't want Burger King. So as I kept looking around...hello! This small barbecue shop popped out at me. I gave it a shot. 

As I made my way into this little hole in the wall shop you can tell right away what you're in for...the air was lingering with smokiness. I ordered the brisket sandwich and it was BOMB! The brisket was tender and delicious. You can taste the spices, smokiness and the hours that was put into making such a delicate piece of beef. As a butcher, I know my beef. 

This place was small with only a few tables but the atmosphere here was inviting. The guy working there was friendly. Unless you're familiar with the area you may miss it. I guess this place is only good for lunch cause they close at 6 pm. I could be wrong. If you're a fan of barbecue give this place a try. I'd go there again. It's next to a tattoo shop across from discount tires. Keep your eyes wide open."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! The food is really good, the prices are very reasonable and the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Adequate BBQ.  That being said, they hold things on a steam table so the meat continues to cook.  Brisket, while ok in taste pretty much shredded almost like stewed meat.  Ribs were ok, but also over done.  Saussage was ok.

Sides (potato salad and baked beans) were ok, but nothing special.

Not sure they do on site smoking of meats. 

Giving the benefit of the doubt here...more accurate rating would be  2.5"}
