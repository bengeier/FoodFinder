{"text":"Lane's appeared to be more of a neighborhood stop than I previously expected. They have a wide variety of traditional donuts, more unique donuts, cookies, and other dessert pastries.   I was mainly here for the donuts, so I opted to try a traditional glazed, a buttercream filled chocolate glazed, and a \"Persian-style\" cinnamon roll (less sweet, with peanuts on top instead of sugar and frosting).   None of them really blew me away, but they weren't overly sweet so I didn't dislike them. Overall it's an OK, but pricey donut shop. I will probably stick to Greenbush for my sugar fix."}
{"text":"Horrible service & exceptionally unhelpful employees. I returned after excellent experiences with their previous location and was very disappointed with the new one."}
{"text":"Lane's Bakery makes the best tasting birthday cakes in Madison, by far, and does terrific decorating. We've ordered at least 20 of their cakes for birthdays over the years and are SO happy they're open again!!"}
{"text":"Chocolate cream filled Bismarck doughnuts..l want to be buried in a pile of these..actually everything I've tasted here is fantastic. Thank god I don't live here--I  would be 300 pounds.."}
{"text":"Pastries and kringle are supurb. But there is a need for better customer service. The older woman who was working made no eye contact, did not great us or thank us for comming in. A smile and some eye contact goes a long way. She acted annoyed that we were there. Very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Lane's is back!  Went in last week and bought a couple of dozen for the office.  Everyone raved.  Since we moved to town in '05 Lane's has been my favorite bakery for quality of product and service and I'm happy they reopened."}
{"text":"Lane's has wonderful cookies and donuts, but what drops it from a 4/5 star review is the service.  I usually stop in on my way to visit family and bring them some treats, as well as pick up something for myself to eat and drink.  This most recent visit was the first I had tried something from the drink menu and I was not impressed.  I should have went to McDonald's and got a better tasting drink at a more reasonable price.    The service if you aren't a regular there isn't the friendliest or the most prompt.  I ordered my drink and some treats.  The person who took my order took her time informing me that the person who would make my drink was in the back getting a cake for another customer.  That was something I would have appreciated knowing when I ordered because I had been waiting for over five minutes by then.  Another customer, an older woman, who must have been a regular came in.  The person's whole demeanor changed - she was friendly and helpful.  At this point, I'm getting annoyed waiting for my drink while the customer who is it for can't get off his cell phone.    I hope that maybe the customer service improves because I'm not sure I will be making another special trip to Lane's in the future."}
{"text":"Horrible service when it wasn't even busy. There was 5 people standing there all talking about how they hated customers instead of actually talking to me. Dry bakery items. Becky was a total prude and a snob for her shitty food. Their coffee is good, but you can tell they had nothing to do with that. Never going back again"}
{"text":"I have visited this bakery two times and both times I have enjoyed it very much. During my last visit I ordered some valentine themed cookies that had white and pink hard frosting. I paired these cookies with a 12 oz regular brewed black coffee and it was the perfect start to my day! I also ordered a danish and that was delicious as well.  Someone recommend their Cronut, which is a cross between a croissant and donut, but  I'll have to get that on my next visit. I look forward to trying their other pastries and cookies. On another note, the bakery was spotless and organized. They seem to also have a some lunch choices. Stop in next time you need a delicious treat!"}
{"text":"The best donuts in Madison, hands down.  The chocolate cream filled and the Persian are my favorites, but they are all very tasty.  Their cakes, especially the whipped cream cakes, are also really good and very affordable."}
{"text":"The best donuts ever. Especially if you get one that is just fresh."}
{"text":"Thee best whip cream cakes!!!  They have a great variety of doughnuts and cookies. Everything is always fresh. My favorite are the Persians, a cinnamon roll with a little frosting and nuts on top. Their coffee is fresh and hot.  They have several tables inside and out.  I've been gong to lanes for years and they don't disappoint.  I like their new larger store at the end of park street.  I really think they have the best donuts in madison."}
{"text":"I enjoy absolutely everything about this place! My co workers and I have become regulars there because staff are so friendly, the sweet treats are adorable (see image below) and delicious, they have great options for lunch, and it is also a cozy space to stop by and grab coffee with a friend. Definitely recommend and will continue to be a regular."}
{"text":"I've been a fan for years.Today is donut appreciation day and Lanes makes the best. The only reason I don't go more often is my clothes. I'd have to buy larger ones and can't afford it."}
{"text":"Their chocolate whipped cream cake is simply to die for. I have requested it as my birthday cake for the last 6 or so years. Every time I order one they are so flexible and wonderful with the silly designs I request on top! I do recommend giving it a night in the fridge to fully thaw. The cake is not half as good when still frozen. Their cookies are cute designs and taste okay. Their cakes are the true stars!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to pick up some paczkis, but found out we should have ordered ahead.  No problem, ordered some for pickup next week.  We all got a doughnut to go, and sat in the shop to eat them.  So good!  It may be a bad thing that this place is on the way home.  highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday cake and it was perfect! Chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and an excellent design on the top! The illustration was of a super cute tiger and the lettering was great as well. Everyone loved the cake, especially the birthday boy, so thank you."}
{"text":"I am torn on this review, on the on hand its a great local business with good food that has been around for ever.   On the other hand, they are real assholes to cyclists. I have gone in a number of times when they were not busy, and brought my bike in the store or leaned it up outside, and they were very very rude to me, and told me to get a car.   So 5 for food, 1 for service."}
{"text":"I'm so happy Lane's opened at their new location in The Atrium on South Park St. They are still going through the pains of being a new team and working out the kinks of only being open a week, but I hope they work it out because their donuts are so heavenly! They also make Kringle, have been selling their own Christmas cookies, and have some cheesecakes for sale. The atmosphere isn't quite cozy yet but they're working on it.  I also wasn't impressed with the mocha I ordered. It tasted like untrained baristas. Still, I am a fan and support that this local business is trying to get settled on the south side. I'll certainly be back, with a clearer review once they've had some time to get comfortable."}
{"text":"This place knows what the fuck is going on. I actually might like this place better than Greenbush, but I would hate to admit that out loud so i will never actually examine it too closely, I'll just distract myself with the doughnuts!  The Persians are a super safe bet, I also highly recommend their cinnamon rolls. The turnovers are a little lack luster (i think all are to be honest, or maybe i just have unrealistic expectations for what could be). I have had and highly recommend many of their cookies! The frosted sugar is great!  And anything coconut!"}
{"text":"Nice assortment of baked goods and coffee.  Open early at 6 i believe donuts were a little soft but still good"}
{"text":"The pastries are pretty solid, but the customer service was a little chilly at best. Maybe I just caught them at the wrong time of day?"}
{"text":"Loveeee this placeeee. My favorite one is the one that has sprinkled sugar on top of it. Kinda like the old school twists I used to buy every morning at school  yum."}
{"text":"Holy cow get here early. I have tried almost everything and aside from a slight expansion in the waistline everything is awesome. Premium donuts are to die for."}
{"text":"I needed a cake for my father's memorial service. I was a mess. I called late. They asked me about my dad and I said he liked bright, rich colors. They made a moist (sorry, I know people hate that word) delicious marble cake with the most beautiful floral decorations. It was absolutely stunning, and they seemed eager to make me very happy, which they did.   I no longer live in Madison, but if I did, I'd be back each week to show them how thankful I am for their efforts.   Nice people, great service, delicious cake. Thank you, Lane's."}
{"text":"Lanes Bakery is a great local spot for pastries and classic desserts. As soon as you walk in, youre welcomed by freshly baking goodies. The sale almost every kind of pastry you can imagine including croissants.  The staff is extremely nice and warn hearted.  If you need a quick donut for breakfast to kick start your day, Lanes Bakery is a great choice."}
{"text":"I went with a friend to purchase a cake from here. I love how spacious and clean the shop was, especially for a bakery. I'm also happy that my friend shared the cake with me. It was by far one of the best cakes that I have ever eaten in my life. From the cake to the cream; it was on point! More please!  Great customer service! I would say A+"}
{"text":"customer service was a bit brash the day we came in.  So be ready to just order what you want and don't ask them to explain too Much.   I ore ordered 3 Kringles and they had them ready when they said. Come early if you don't pre order."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to buying some treats from this bakery. I got a little lost after dropping off my daughter in Fish Hatchery after a soccer practice. I was happy that I had 3 minutes to spare, it was already 5:57pm when I pulled into parking infront of the store. As soon as the staff saw me. She ran straight to the door to close it. Not caring at all. I would have taken 1 minute to order. All I wanted was some macarons and cookie for my daughter but she couldn't spare. I've frequented this place even at their old location but now not sure if I even want to venture as I live in the East side and work in West, I have to make a conscious effort to come here but not anymore. Chocolatarian (East side) wasn't this rude to their customers so I'll go their way instead."}
{"text":"I've dropped in twice to their new location in the Villager Mall and sampled the apple turnover ($2) and a coconut cake doughnut ($1).    The massive apple turnover was just OK.  Liked the flaky pastry, but the apple filling could use some more cinnamon or nutmeg - I found it a little bland.  The coconut cake doughnut was much better.  It was still remarkably fresh at 4PM in the afternoon.  There was nice textural contrast between the moist interior and the cakey exterior.  Just the right amount of sweet.  It was very similar in taste to the cake doughnuts at Greenbush Bakery (a good thing).  While the staff is as friendly as they were in the old location, they are still learning the how to use the cash register.  During checkout on both my visits, the cashier just stared at the register for about 45 seconds trying to figure out what key it press.  It doesn't help that there are no prices listed anywhere in the bakery (there is a price list for beverages).  I have not had the chance to try any of the coffee drinks yet.  The interior is clean, but a little sterile.  I'm sure it will acquire a homier vibe once the business gets more established in its new location.  Free wi-fi is a plus."}
{"text":"Great donuts! I can't speak to a lot of the other offerings but they almost always have samples and seating so I consider those other big pluses. Service is usually very fast"}
{"text":"Lane's makes delectable baked goods and I especially enjoy their cookies. I brought in their chocolate chip cookies to work and my coworkers claimed they were the best chocolate chip cookies they had ever had. I got their  black and white cookies and they were so delightful. The cookie was fluffy like a cake and the chocolate frosting was so delicious."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed by Lane's. They have a decent selection, but their prices and quality weren't great. I ordered a caramel latte that was advertised as their drink special, but it tasted like they used a mix instead of real coffee beans. And the drink was very watered down. Not something I want to pay $3 for! The second time I went, I got a cappuccino which seriously tasted like garbage. It tastes like the cappuccinos you get from those machines in gas stations. I also ordered a double shot espresso to go, and they initially said they couldn't do plain espresso to go. What?? You just put it in a regular size cup. So yeah, the barista was kind of incompetent and seemed very inexperienced. I got two danishes as well, both of which tasted all right and were moist enough, but certainly nothing special. They were one step up from gas-station pastries. Sorry, another gas station comparison. Donuts are good though.  What I did like about Lane's was that the inside is quite large, and they have many pre-made cakes. They also have numerous things you can sample as well as a large selection of baked items. Lane's seems like it'd be a great place to take kids, as they had some Sesame Street themed cookies and other fun decorated baked goods, but overall their taste and quality were not impressive.  I really wanted to love this place. But the coffee was what did it for me. I can tolerate mediocre baked goods, but if you're going to serve crappy tasting coffee, it's a deal breaker."}
{"text":"I ordered a birthday cake for a co-worker's birthday and Nessa was so helpful, professional, and friendly on the phone. I wasn't aware of the 48 hr policy that the bakery needed in order to take the cake order (I'm from out of town and one of the local people I'm working with here in Madison highly recommended Lane's). Despite the lateness the bakery took my order and the cake could NOT have been more perfect! It was absolutely delicious and beautifully decorated/colored!! The birthday girl nearly cried! So, THANK YOU Lane's! You made a very special day even more special!"}
{"text":"I always like the Kringle, so when I stopped in I had to get one also. This place is fantastic, the employees are very friendly and helpful and more than accommodating. I called in to get 18 assorted donuts to go and they had it finished in minutes, even with the morning rush. Make sure and get a Kringle while you are there!!!"}
{"text":"Frosted sugar cookies are my favorite food and this is my go-to bakery. I custom ordered 2 dozen cookies and they were very flexible with my requests and got the order done quickly. I've tried many other bakeries around and they do it best! Wide variety, and their donuts and Kringle are also delicious. Highly recommend for a sweet treat."}
{"text":"The customer service was beyond terrible/rude, and there are no vegetarian options anymore.  I've been going sporadically to their Park Street location over the past few years, and their donughts are meh (not too sweet, which is good, but sometimes stale and generally not the perfect consistency).  I go here for lunch every so often, but hadn't been in quite a while.  I went therefor lunch last week Thursday, but found nothing vegetarian on the menu, so only bought some molasses cookies from a display.  They were unbelievably hard and stale.  I ate one of the ten that came in the box anyway, but then decided to call them to let them know that the cookies were stale in case they cared and they could test a box themselves to see if they truly were stale, or maybe they could apologize and offer me some incentive to come back again.  The woman on the phone was really nice and understanding.  Although she said she doubted the cookies were stale, she said she'd let management know so they could decide for themselves.  She also asked if I wanted someone to call me back the next day.  I initially said no, but then she kept offering it, and I eventually said yes it would be nice to have a call back since maybe the manager who called me back would be able to offer me a coupon if I returned or apologize or commiserate over the loss of my $5 on this box of cookies - show some sort of compassion.  I never received a callback.  Then, today, Tuesday, a friend suggested we go there for lunch.  I thought, \"Sure, why not.  They might have some vegetarian specials today of soups or sandwiches.\"  No such luck.  I asked the cashier who was taking our order (very politely) whether she had any recommendations for vegetarian options.  She said I could order any of the sandwiches without meat.  I said that a lot of times when I ordered sandwiches without the meat, they didn't have much flavor.  I asked if she had seen any particular sandwich being ordered without meat a lot or if she had any recommendations.  She gave a huge sigh as though she was pissed off at being asked to think.  I gave her 30 seconds to scan over the menu.  When she was still silent, I asked her, \"It looks like the only things I can have in my sandwich would be the cheese, lettuce, and tomato.  Is that correct?  That's all I see in these sandwiches on the menu.\"  She corrected me to say there was also onion available, but that was it.  I asked if there were any vegetarian soups, and she glanced over and then said \"No,\" with a bit of an attitude.  I said, \"OK, well thank you for your help.  Do you know if there's a manager available?\"  A manager did eventually come out and ask if she could help me.  I told her (very politely) that I had some feedback.  I told her that I had been in twice within 7 days and that there wasn't anything I could eat off the lunch menu since I was a vegetarian.  She said, \"I know we don't have many vegetarian options.\"  I was taken aback by her dismissive comment.  I explained that I had come many times a long time ago and that they had had some vegetarian soups and a macaroni and cheese option.  She said dismissively that they didn't have those options anymore.  I told her that I had come in some days ago and that I had bought stale cookies but that no one ever called me back about it.  She said that the manager probably hadn't called me back because she had thought it was \"stupid.\"  I was incredulous at how rude she was being.  A customer next to me was half gawking at her rudeness, half laughing.  I asked her if maybe she was going to do anything as a result of this conversation, such as tell another manager about this.  She said that she would.  My friend had ordered lunch, and I sat there drinking water, when another manager came out to our table and aggressively said, \"I hear you are angry about something.\"  I looked up at her and said that I wasn't angry at all and that I had tried to provide feedback.  She then backed down and did start apologizing half heartedly for her staff's behavior and for her lack of calling me back when I had been assured that someone would call me back.  She was kind of nice about it, but I could tell she didn't mean any of the apologies and she thought I was a horrible person for being a vegetarian.  The food on the lunch menu is OK, but pricey.  If you want vegetarian options, don't go here.  If you want nice customer service, don't go here."}
