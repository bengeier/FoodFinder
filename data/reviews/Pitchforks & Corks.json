{"text":"An amazing find that deserves recognition.  Great atmosphere, happy hour and live jazz music!  This will be my new go-to spot to kick-start  the  weekend."}
{"text":"An extremely cool location - a place to get wine, beer, coffee, food, in the same building as ASU's great new campus store.  Its a nice space, with a good vibe, that includes a patio overlooking College Ave.  We stopped there pre-game before the Stanford game and it was a great place to have a couple of beers and look out over the  game day crowd.  Nice to be able to enjoy a relaxed off-Mill avenue place to hang out and support ASU.  Please give them a try - you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Nice place! It's upstairs above the asu gift shop. Serves alcohol on campus which is awesome. Had my reserves when I walked in because it was empty. You order at the counter and they bring it to you, food is delicious and happy hour prices are awesome! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Pitchfork and Corks and I enjoyed it as much as my first time. I love to visit when I have some extra time on my meter and looking for a quick, filling, and inexpensive bite.  The place is modern in style, typically quiet and not crowded when I visit around brunch time allowing me to seat myself wherever suits me. It is the perfect environment to relax and enjoy your food.  I always feel like I'm treating myself due to the elegant environment and tasty, well-crafted food that looks like it would cost more than it actually does! The portions are a decent size too! Craft salads are piled high and run about $6, sandwiches with a side potato salad around $5, and omelettes with a side salad around $4. They also have ready-to-go plates, pastries, and coffee options if you're looking to run in and out.   I highly recommend if you're looking for craft food and an upscale atmosphere at an affordable price!"}
{"text":"The layout, bar and service are great. Food is great and wine selection is pretty good. This place is across from Postinos and could be a good replacement for sure. Side salad and potato salad were ehhh. So that's why the four stars but other than that, great experience."}
{"text":"The service was fabulous very courteous and friendly staff along with great food and a very relaxing atmosphere. I would highly recommend  this establishment to anyone!"}
{"text":"I love Pitchforks! I come here all the time to grab coffee, eat lunch, or even just to study. The atmosphere is great and the staff is fantastic! Maddie, Autum, Tori, and all the others always brighten my day! Pitchforks is definitely my favorite spot in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Great little place just north of campus. They have great prices and great food. The menu is a bit small but it isn't much of a restaurant more of a wine and coffee cafe. Great way to end a day of classes I would say! And if you like wine they have quite the wine selection!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  especially with the Jazz band playing in the background.  Could use $5 pitchers to make it perfect!"}
{"text":"Great new spot on the second floor of the freshly opened College Avenue Commons. Vantage point from the patio offers great views and a modern, classier edge for the sophisticated ASU faculty member or administrative staff. They have happy hour deals including $1 off house wines and $5 beers (think local craft from San Tan). The small menu offers nibbles but this prime location is a great starting point for a Friday Happy Hour. Soon to join the area: Local fave Postino and Snooze. Overall, worth a chance to hob-nob with Dr. Crow and his elite inner circle."}
{"text":"We stopped in yesterday for a glass of wine and dessert on the patio.  We brought our dog and enjoyed hanging out on the patio with her.  Great space with great views of A mountain.  They have a nice selection of nibbles, wine and sweet treats too.  Our server was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Really great place! Good wine and cocktail menu and very affordable priced food. I got the ham omelet and it was delicious! Also came with a small olive salad that was good and it was all $4. Atmosphere is very relaxed and fairly quiet, overall nice place. The service was really nice but was slow, ordered and it took over 15 minutes to get the glass of wine, took over 30 minutes for the food to come out. Will still definitely come back though!"}
{"text":"ASU opened this place up during the fall 2014 semester, and it's a nice place to stop by and relax. I walk past it a couple times a week on the way to and from class; it's an extremely convenient location for students and offers everything you need for a casual lunch experience with friends.  I've stopped by a few times during lunch for the $5 beers and sandwiches. It's actually a really awesome venue with a very modern interior and an expansive balcony. I thought it was poised to be the perfect addition to College Avenue... that was, until Postino opened up right across the street with their happy hour specials. Still, Pitchfork & Corks is a great place to stop by and it seems to be frequently used by ASU faculty and their special guests."}
{"text":"Caesar salad with chicken is very crisp. I've also had the Smoked Ham Omelet which I recommend as well. I've come back to have both again so the taste is great. One thing is that the low tables are a bit odd for eating but great to just have coffee."}
