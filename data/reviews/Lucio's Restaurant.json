{"text":"I'm giving this review 2 stars only because of the quickness of service. Everything else is subpar. The ingredients are not quality and the portions are very small for how much you are paying. You will also be charged extra for things that normally come with the entre at similar restaraunts. The staff is hit or miss sometimes friendly sometimes not so much and the dining room also doubles as an underground poker league."}
{"text":"recently ordered delivery which was a bargain at $1.75 delivery fee.  ordered the cavatellis (which came with a small salad & garlic bread), and an order of breaded mushrooms.  delivery guy was right on time.  food was packaged very nicely.  the pasta must have weighed about 2 pounds !  quite a bargain, all the food + delivery for only $14.  i'll have leftovers for 2 nights.  not the BEST italian food i've ever had, but just fine for a night when i don't want to cook.  good deal."}
{"text":"... My first ever review. I'm not a negative guy but this place hardcore embarrassed themselves this past Saturday during the Ohio State game. My mother called and ordered \"wings, a sheet pizza and a sandwich tray\" while the wings were good and I suppose the rest of the food was adequate we had a whole different problem. Apparently when my mother made the order they took the credit card number down incorrectly. This happens I know. They called to correct the problem and no one picked up so they left a voicemail. After explaining the problem and THINKING the call was ended the (I'm assuming manager) decided to call us \"fucking assholes\" and to then insult the KID that took the order by calling him a \"fucking idiot\". I had not heard the message till after the food was delivered. They sent a 90 pound girl with a broken wrist so I had to carry all the food in myself, which was no problem at all but seems also quite unprofessional. If this manager is the kind of person they have calling customers  I can't imagine it's a very tight ship..."}
{"text":"Not my usual pizza place. But on a couple of random occasions we have been in the neighborhood and ordered the breakfast pizza we have never been disappointed. Service is quick and friendly and the food is excellent."}
{"text":"This is a small, Italian joint in Lake County. You're not going to get any better than a 3 star experience here, quite frankly.   There isn't much I can really say about Lucio's because it's just so unremarkable. It's within walking distance to my parents house.... and I wanted pizza.... and I needed to get it ASAP because I was hungrayyy.... and that's really about it.   As a teenager, this was sort of a hangout place for the locals. We thought we were cool going here without our parents and ordering a pizza like a big kid. It has since changed owners and been remodeled. I liked the older setup -- and there wasn't any cheesy Italian chef wallpaper border in those days.   The pizza was okay. Fairly adequate. Yep. Worth the price too. I'd get it again if I had to."}
{"text":"I lowered my previous 5-star rating, because (as my previous review stated) we ordered our food to be delivered.  We have been using the online menu.  We  have always ordered the beer batter fish and the fried perch.  Each order had 4 pieces of fish for $8.95.  Price was not bad at all, but this past Friday, both orders of fish came with only 3 pieces.  When I called and asked why we had been shorted, I was told that the online menu was out of date....My guess is that it was out of date since the previous week, because for that past month or so we have done this every Friday and got 4 pieces of fish.  But honestly, is it the customers fault that the restaurant keeps an out of date menu on their own website?  I held off on this review to see if they had changed it, but  it has been another 5 days and still the same.  I will find another place for our Friday \"order in\" ritual."}
{"text":"We ordered an Italian stromboli, and the stromzana, along with garlic cheese bread. The amount of grease on the stromboli's was disgusting, it spanned the entire box, and for $8 each they were no bigger than hot pockets...very disappointing.  Very scant fillings, very doughy and undercooked. The garlic cheese bread was void of all garlic flavor and left a lot to be desired by my palate. Save yourself the let down, and order elsewhere. Your mouth and wallet will thank you."}
{"text":"My wife and I got takeout from Lucio's tonight.  We both got the cavatelli with meatballs dinner (salad, roll or garlic toast and pasta) and everything was very good- the sauce on the pasta has a nice flavor.  Would definitely recommend Lucio's for dine in or carry out."}
{"text":"Called in for delivery. Staff was extremely nice and so was driver. I had the cavatelli with Alfredo, side salad and bread. I asked there to be no tomato or cucumbers but I can tell they pulled them off bc there were a few in there. Didn't get any silverware or napkins. Also, the sauce is very very sparse! A lot of my cavatelli were dry with no sauce: BUT, The food itself was very good! Mistakes happen. Just please please do not pull off an item that someone doesn't want. If I were allergic that would have been terrible. Just remake the salad with would take 30 seconds. We also got a burger, and a few other things that were good as well. Def will order again!"}
