{"text":"If you are looking for Japanese food, this is NOT the place to eat.  It smells like Vietnamese pho soup.  It looks like weird Vietnamese pho noodles.  It doesn't taste like Vietnamese nor Japanese food.   More than half of each dish was made of bean sprouts.   The shrimp tempura was a sorry excuse of deep fried crumbs.   Save your stomach and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I I was at the Core location for a bowl of beef brisket noodle soup. I know I can't expect high quality from food court, but I have to say that I am somewhat disappointed with what I've ordered. Honestly, I have had much better for less than $8.81 with way better quality and quantity at Bankers' Hall. The noodle I have gotten for lunch was very soft and it was so soft that I had to eat my noodle soup with a spoon, because I can't manage to pick it up with my chop sticks; also there was so little noodle, or maybe because they have all been broken down. On the other hand, I have had their rice dishes and they are actually quite good, hence my disappointment from the noodle. I may go back for rich dishes, but stay away from the soup for sure...Or maybe it's just my luck... :["}
{"text":"I am not even sure what I ate... The other review that says \"because the line is big does not mean it is good\" couldn't be more correct, the only reason I went there was because of the line up. You are pretty much eating garbage chicken with watered down sauce on plain rice. Then you think you are putting soya sauce on it for some taste but it turns out to be fish sauce or something. Don't eat here. A Edo would be a blessing in this area."}
{"text":"For a fast food place, the food is fresh and good. Ordered some sushi and sukiyaki beef to go. Made quick, reasonably priced and the counter staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Just because it's busy during lunch hour doesn't means it's any good. There was chicken in my food when I ordered beef. The noodles tasted very doughy and the food was sloppy and rushed."}
{"text":"I don't normally eat at a food court, because I can pay a dollar or two more and get more of a homemade meal elsewhere. I was in the mall and didn't want to walk to Chinatown in the cold. I heard on Zomato that the beef brisket noodle soup is decent.   For $8.81 (with GST), the beef brisket noodle soup was not bad. My plastic bowl was filled with a generous heaping of slippery noodles and sprouts. The broth was piping hot, though too salty. The brisket was tasty and I liked the addition of daikon, carrots, and onions."}
{"text":"It's edible...that's not saying much.   I had the beef teriyaki.    The rice wasn't very good, the beef teriyaki wasn't very good...but I mean the food was fresh just wasn't very good.   The price was okay cheap but not super cheap.....    It was super underwhelming.  I would not go back.  I really like the name of the place so I want to like the place, but I can't.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Food Court dining. Very slow preparation for a food court.  The meal could have been much better. It was cheap but not overly cheap.  Will I return.  Maybe once I'm bored of all the other locations and the price is still low."}
{"text":"Considering the lines this place has I expected a lot better - burnt is the best way to describe this food.  Edo does a MUCH better job with yakisoba.  It's already pricey for a food court, poor quality food.   I'll never be back, I strong suggest you don't go period."}
{"text":"Free fruit cups and spring rolls! Foul food! Your typical lunchtime fast food joint. They serve noodles and food combos. Slightly cheaper than neighboring Thai Island. I always get tricked into coming here because I'm starving by lunchtime and there's always a line a Thai Island but no line at Koya! I think I'm being smart by ordering here, but once I get my food I realize pretty quickly why there's never a line here.  Noodles are not impressive - almost exclusively broth and weirdly undercooked veggies, and very little actual noodle. The few sad strands I got in my ramen were way overcooked and soggy.  Next time I'll just wait in line."}
{"text":"I've gone here often but over various times I've been disappointed. They are extremely cheap when it comes to meat. My boyfriend always pays for extra beef, yet it looks exactly the same as mine without extra. When we ask, they insist it's extra, it's not. Today we asked for extra beef on the side, and watched the cook pour out one order of beef and split some of the meat out and cooked it separately as his \"extra\" amount. Absolutely ridiculous. Extra meat is almost 4 dollars, almost half the meal price. Rip off."}
