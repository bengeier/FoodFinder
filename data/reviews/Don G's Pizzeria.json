{"text":"Cool pizza place. They have a great selection of lunch and dinner items. Their gyro pizza is really good and so is their stromboli and calzone. Delivery is pretty fast and the deliverer was friendly."}
{"text":"Good pizza. But they need a menu online somewhere I couldn't find one. Nice delivery guy. Extra cheese and pepperoni so good."}
{"text":"Best Pizza ever!!!!!! Gyros are slamming too :) eat here frequently for lunch and recommend it to everyone..."}
{"text":"I really liked this pizza. More then most in the area. It was delivered quick and pretty cheap also.  Make sure you tell them if you are paying with card because they don't ask you and it's a hassle at the door. But besides that I will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"They have very good food here, the Pizza is Great and the work place is open for al to see through the window!...... my only negative is last time i was there, the waiting area was...scary, cob webs in every corner...dark and musty...BUT the food..excellantio!..i made that word up just now..lol   the kitchen looks clean and they all wore glove....anyhow..order!"}
{"text":"We had calzones and they looked likes pizza flipped on top of each other. I barely tasted sauce in the inside and nothing stood out about it. First and last time ordering from there."}
{"text":"I've had their pizza delivered for years.  It has gone down hill. Since 2013 start, I haven't ordered from here cause its not worth it. The last pizza was so bad we threw it out.  The pizza before that was burnt, and they replaced it, but the second time we figured it was on us and just won't order there any more."}
{"text":"This pizza is great! Always fast with their deliveries even on weekend nights.  The sausage they use on their pizza is the best I've ever had!  My family orders from here regularly."}
{"text":"my brother it's a very good restaurant I like it they have good food it's awesome so awesome that it literally ruined my social life because all I want to do is go eat there"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! We dined in for the first time and it was WONDERFUL.

Customer service was excellent, everyone was happy and eager to help.

Buffalo chicken pizza- AMAZING! Breaded buffalo chicken pieces topped with cheese, bacon and more cheese. One of the best pizzas I've ever had. Crust is a traditional type, crunchy and fresh tasting. Overall wonderful pizza. I can't wait to try another kind. 

The Don Gi's Fire Burger: let me tell you..this is one of the best burgers you will EVER have. Beef patty topped with provolone cheese, breaded and fried jalape√±o pepper rings, bacon and a creamy chipotle mayo. You'll crave this burger! Flavorful, mouth watering, phenomenal burger. You MUST try this burger. 

The kids had chicken fingers, of course. I really can't review a chicken finger. They were good, says the child!"}
{"text":"Tons to pick from on their menu. A family fave of ours for years plus they are open late."}
{"text":"This is some of the best food in the old Brooklyn area. I love the burgers and specialty pizzas. The wings are always a good size and the sauces are excellent. The honey mustard wings have a bit of a kick to them. The staff is real nice. This is a family owned business that never let's down."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time ordering from Don G 's and the food was great! I ordered an extra large sausage and pepperoni pizza, cheese stuffed bread sticks, and hot barbecue wings. The pizza was cheesy with a crisp crust that was not too thick and just the right amount of sauce. The sausage had great flavor that was not overpowering.  The wings were huge, juicy, and had a delicious sauce on them. Very good! Oh and the bread sticks were like giant mozzarella sticks This is definitely my new pizza place!!!"}
{"text":"Don Gi's quickly became our go-to pizza delivery spot when we moved to Old Brooklyn. Their crust and cheese are especially delicious! We typically go for supreme and sausage or ham and pineapple,  but everything we have tried so far has been really good. We were shocked to find that even their salads are worth trying - made with fresh ingredients and hearty. Any time our parents come into town, they ask for us to have Don Gi's on standby :) If you live in the area, you'd be remiss not to try it!"}
{"text":"So I had never heard of this place till a friend of mine told me that he he found these good wings in Cleveland (he's from buffalo, so he's a hater jk). From there I found some coupons in that random book u get them with ads in it and with saving comes more ordering stuff. So I call to order and the lady on the phone wasn't pleasant at all, these appears to be a trend in this whole Brooklyn old Brooklyn area. The person who takes ur order is just mad, clearly it's a thing.  But to not let this evil person discourage u. The food was F'ing delicious. The Pizza was the best I've had possible ever. The wings were good, better than most but just good.  I was told to order them extra crisp, which I forgot cause of the alcohol, so they might be great if I ordered them the way I was told by my buffalonian friend (I'll take part of the blame for the wings not being better). This little random a pizza spot was really good and would get 5 stars if it wasn't for the awful customer service. Did I mention they didn't have menus, they also don't have an online menu. If they had an online menus then I don't have to ask what kind of wings do u have whiiiiich prolly would have stop the lady on the phone from catching an attitude after reading 4 out of the 16 sauces, just sayin. I'll go back here again but I'm pretty over all the \"this area bad customer service\" so hopefully they don't ruin this whole \"I love this new place\" experience I'm having."}
{"text":"The pizza doesn't stand out. For what it's worth, it's pizza that seems to be at any other neighborhood pizza place.
There's plenty of mozzarella cheese, just a little bit of sauce. Greasy on the bottom. Crust is hard although not burnt. 

I'll give them kudos for the only public place in the OB that offers wifi and as an open business, Dongi's makes the OB more livlier."}
{"text":"Apparently the evening manager Roy loves to handle customers like they don't matter. After waiting 2 hours for a delivery. (We were fine with wait and understood weather conditions. 

Once the pizza finally arrived, they had delivered and incorrect pizza. I called and spoke to Roy and he said for me to deal with it Bc he has new customers he has to take care of. I told Roy that I simply wanted a credit for a portion of the pizza or even a phone call next time saying the pizza we ordered can not be made per that request. After asking Roy if I should receive a phone call his response was \"I don't know. I'm busy, I can't call everyone\"

I then asked for his name and title and he told me
If he has a problem with the way I handle his business to call and speak to the owner tomorrow bc at this point he doesn't care. 

Frankly, if Roy would've just listened he would've known he didn't need to bring another pizza out,
Tell me to come up and pick up the mistake, or basically tell me my business didn't matter.

I told him I would follow up with the owner tomorrow and he then said \"I have your name and address basically threatening me over a pizza\"

This place used to be a good place to order delivery. We will no longer be using this service."}
{"text":"This Pizzeria used to be my favorite but lately their pizzas have been very greasy overall they're very fast and their service is pretty nice the atmosphere here also is very nice the people seem nice."}
{"text":"Had a pizza delivered around 9pm 7/21/16.  Opened box pizza was very burnt.  Bottom was burnt and the crust was so hard from being burnt.  the sausage was almost black.  I immediately called Don G's and nicely explained to girl.  She responded \"I made that pizza and it is not burnt\".  She was very rude.  We have gotton many pizza's there but never again."}
