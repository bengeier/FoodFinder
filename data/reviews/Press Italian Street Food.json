{"text":"Oh my gosh, the deliciousness!! So glad I forgot to bring my lunch to work.   My work usually has a different food truck every day, and so far this is my favorite!  The paninis all looked amazing, and if I could, I would have ordered one of each for my friends :)"}
{"text":"Where you ever so disappointed with a meal you felt like eating again?  My husband was so disappointed from the food from another food truck he thought he had to eat again. (we had lots of leftovers we just left) He decided an Italian Press Sandwich would be better.  He ordered the sandwich that came with one side so he picked crispy potatoes with gorgonzola sauce. (that sounds good doesn't it?)  The sandwich was very dry and seemed to lack the pepper pesto it was suppose to have. Some of the potatoes were really delicious with fresh herbs and light drizzle of gorgonzola sauce but the rest of the potatoes were burnt tasting and without sauce.  meh"}
{"text":"I went with the farm salad and bruschetta.  I wasn't sure about going with a healthier option from a food truck but I was glad I did.  I can't get over how fresh everything was!  The salad had blackberries, shaved parmesan, chicken and granola.  Everything was so crisp and fresh.  The balsamic for the bruschetta was a little on the sweet side (which I liked) and the herbs were so flavorful.  It was good quality food."}
{"text":"Found this food truck at the Street Eats Festival at the Salt River Fields and out of all the options I tried I like Press the best. Other trucks didn't have a reduced price offering after visitors paid $12 to get in but Press delivered in this category with appetizers priced in the $1-$3 range and half sandwich/salad combos for $6.  The arugula side salad was quite plain dressed with just a tad of balsamic vinegar but they went nicely inside the Italian panini which came with salami, pepperoni, mortadella, and provolone. The website says that the Italian comes with a red pepper pesto but my sandwich appeared to come without this spread. Nonetheless it toasted, simple, and well executed.   At $6 one of the few places that delivered good food and value at the festival."}
