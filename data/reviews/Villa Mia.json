{"text":"And when the Clams Vignole, and they were awesome. Wife had the rogatoni pomodore.  Great find."}
{"text":"Omg... Just came from dinner. Never again. Ran out of tap beer, and brought us a half a glass. No veal, even though we called yesterday and asked about their veal. Was told \"truck is not coming in till Friday \" by the waitress. WTH!! Food not great at all, and at the end of the meal, the waitress brought us \"the box\" for US to put our left over food in. Really ?? How about removing the plate to the back, and doing it there. Last time someone gave me a food box was at Olive Garden, so that says it all. Ugh... So much better when it was La Strada. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Just went to this place last night.  This place is understaffed, the service is horrible and they were out of everything we wanted.  After finnally getting our food it was just ok.  I was hoping that the food would make up for the lousy service and atmosphere but i was disappointed.  Will not be going back and i do not recommend."}
{"text":"My son and I took a trip there not long after their opening.  We both opted for the veal parm. It was delicious. The serving was generous and it arrived quickly.

Really can't ask for more from a small local place."}
{"text":"Want \"Brooklyn\" pizza prepared by some kid, go across the street.  Want New York pizza prepared by Louie from Brooklyn...this is the place.  Fresh dough, good tomato sauce, just like I like it.  The other food looked good as well.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza in the area. Last night I ordered the cheese and veggie delight pizza. The crust was perfect and the cheese and sauce combo reminded me of fantastic Boston North End pizza.
Finally my quest for great Pizza in NC has come to an end"}
{"text":"\"Lucky\" Luciano Suppa is gone, and with him so goes my support and any hopes for the future of this place...."}
{"text":"We recently ordered pizza from them, twice in the past month and both times we were pleased with the pizza. We liked it better than Brooklyn Pizza. 

The crust was just right.. not too thick and not too thin either. The sauce was tasty & was the right amount...same thing with the cheese.

They do delivery to our neighborhood so that is also a plus for those times we are too lazy to go out! We will definitely be back for more pizza here."}
{"text":"This is our go-to local restaurant now. Always good Italian food. Great pizza for North Carolina.  Very friendly. Family owned. Can't say enough good things about them!"}
{"text":"I walked in with my husband for lunch a few days ago. I can't review the food because we never ordered, never sat down and saw nobody but the dishwasher. The restaurant was empty, and after 8 long minutes we left. I'm curious as to why there are security cameras all over the place though. Near the counter, off to the side but in full view is a live feed from about 6 security cameras. Very uncomfortable to know that the entire place could be watching me eat! can you say creepy? 
You would think it could have been used to notice my husband and I standing there and offer us a table in a completely empty restaurant. No matter to me, we left and went to a wonderful Greek restaurant in a shopping center across the street. I will be very happy to patronize them again! Villa Mia never got my business and never will. NO STARS if I could, but I have to give one just to post the review."}
{"text":"Wife and I ate here for the first time. Had the vodka penne pasta and wife had the egg plant. Mine was great. Hers good but a little salty. She had house red wine which was good and a good pour. I had a draft beer which was fine. 

Also tried a slice of pizza which was on special. It was good also. The whole pizzas are 18\" which is a monster.

It was our waitresses first night and she really did a great job. Total bill was 32.00 which I thought was very reasonable.


We'll be back soon"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in the area IMO and I am from the Philly-NJ area....where there are great pizza joints on every block....and they come very very close.   Subs are good too.  Prices are a little higher than most....but you get what you pay for.   Sausage rolls and Calzones are very good and my GF LOVEs their Shrimp Scampi.  New owners took over a couple years back (was La Strada) and they have improved the place (LaStrada was pretty good too).  It is my go to place when I want takeout!"}
{"text":"Had the steamed mussels. I uploaded a photo here. The house wines are a great deal, for only 5$ a glass.  Can't understand why others find that expensive. 

Hard to find anyone offering wine, let alone at $5 bucks a glass - that's as good a deal as you can get.  This is my 3rd time back with the entire family (2 young adults 18 and over) and everyone was happy. 

The mussels I ordered were listed as \"appetizer\" but the plate was full enough that when adding in the unlimited  focaccia bread they keep giving you for dipping, it was sufficient as a light meal for me by itself.  The bread is herb encrusted with rosemary, oregano and other seasonings. 

The steamed mussels had a perfect white wine, butter, garlic, and herb sauce. Just a touch of pepper without overdoing it.  My \"Momma\" herself couldn't have made them better.

We also had the \"Caprese\" for appetizer, The basil was fresh and mozarella above average, moist, and very fresh tasting. The quality of food here is as good if not better than Carabbas and much better than the bland overcooked pasta at Buco de Beppo. Best of all, its right next door for all of us that live nearby.  

It's like having nonno and nonna cooking for us right down the street. Trust me, I'm 54 year old, born to 2 100% Italian immigrants, and lived in Italy for 18 months and spent entire summers there.  I've eaten locally from Milan to Venice and Rome to Sicily. It doesn't get better than this state side. 

The pastas are a higher quality durum wheat/semolina blend that is much chewier than the bland \"dumpling-like\" consistency of pasta most other places serve. Then again, if you are used to poor quality Italian pasta that is overcooked like dumpling mush, (which is what most other places push off as Italian) and cheap processed cheese, you should not eat here."}
{"text":"I called here the other day & the phone rang & rang, then finally went to a fax signal.  I called later & no answer.  I think they may be out of business."}
