{"text":"The street tacos were excellent. I enjoyed the chicken, carne asada, and mahi mahi tacos. I ordered them a la carte so I didn't get the rice and beans on the side. My husband ordered some tacos with rice and beans and I noticed that the rice and beans looked very dry and a bit stale. I tried them and they definitely were not fresh. I looked over to the plates of others and the rice and beans looked the same. 

It is a shame that they serve the sides this way because the tacos were delicious."}
{"text":"We've tried to find a decent margarita in the Pinnacle Peak area for 14 years and now  must finally conclude that one does not exist. We returned to Jalapeno's after avoiding it mostly over the years, choosing instead to head to Cantina Laredo to the south or to Carefree/Cave Creek. The house margarita was poured into a tumbler- sized glass and as a result you could barely taste any tequila. Their mix is pretty bad. We ordered a shot to share that spruced it up, but asked for \"something affordable\" suggesting Herradura, which is usually cheaper. The server was clueless and the small shot cost $9. We decided to try the Sangria Swirl instead and it was unbelievably bad and undrinkable. The server didn't care that we were not finding any satisfaction with the cocktails. I would say that if you like green corn tamales and don't need a margarita, this isn't a bad place to visit.  

Update - I see by the manager's response I just have my facts wrong! Well there you have it. I'm sure that the many tourists that frequent this place wouldn't know what a proper margarita is supposed to taste like.  Why not simply offer your customers to have those \"almost two ounces of tequila\" served in a smaller glass instead of swimming in a 16 oz tumbler of sweet mix?  How about...hold on...serving it in a margarita glass!"}

Great place. Tell them it's your first time and they'll bring you their signature Best of Phoenix Sweet Corn Tamale. So good!

HH- 1/2 off appetizers, 2.50 domestics, 3.50 imports, 3.50 signature margarita. 

My wife and I had their delicious chips and salsa then split the mexican pizza. It was way too big to finish! We were bummed that we were too full try try an entree so we'll have to give this place another try soon.

{"text":"Sloppy service but great margaritas. We were amazed at the abundance of wait staff and still no service. They all seemed preoccupied, even the bartender who wasn't able to clear the bar after guests left. 
Really the only reason to patronize this establishment is on Tuesday for $5 top shelf margaritas."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Hatch Chile margaritas are a seasonal treat. Service is always attentive. Ask for the spicy salsa option. It's a nice accompaniment for the regular salsa. Lots of options for vegetarians. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We have been to Jalapeño Inferno several times over the last few years while visiting from out of town. The last 4-5 times we have been the service and food have been really mediocre....but we are suckers for good margs and chips & salsa. We dined there again last night hoping they had redeemed themselves, but half of the food came out warm, the other half cold... like had been sitting on a counter for 30 minutes while the other food was being prepared, cold. It's pretty tough to mess up steak and fish tacos, but they were bad... really bad. The server did her best to keep up and she was super sweet. It was truthfully a kitchen error. Needless to say, we will be avoiding this place going forward."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 3 because I feel that a 3 is a generous rating. First of all, let's talk of seating. If I wanted to have a community meal with strangers I would say eff it and join a hippy colony on the beach and say eff it to hygiene and share finger food with people who haven't showered since Watergate. SECONDLY let's talk food, the food...oh the food. Plain, greasy, over portioned, and slapped on a plate with some dry rice and some quick boiled black beans. The options in the menu are disguised into giving you choices but they're all practically the same. The spicy menu that they warn you about has warm bland Americanized Mexican food. The service was even more of a disappointment, the woman had attitude and had us repeat practically everything we ordered after she would leave for several minutes. It was shocking, but I can see where some crave the mediocrity of food. For me, I'd rather go to the Spotted Donkey or Hancienda over this place."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Jalapeño inferno. I had the surf n turf fajitas and my friends had the signature fundido. The cheese and spinach appetizer was incredible - and the salsa was amazing. A couple of nits - this is the second time I've walked in and the second time I've been hit by the door of someone walking out! They should probably fix that. Also took us 3 tries to get plates for our chips n salsa - weird in an otherwise great service night."}
{"text":"Great feed! And great service!  Miranda was the best. We will request her next time. Not only was she personable and professional, but accommodated our request to move tables.  KUDOS, MIRANDA!"}
{"text":"So disappointed... Went for Taco Tue. The food was very bland no flavor at all, even the salsa had no flavor or spice, I love most any Mexican food so was hoping for a good place near home... I ll keep looking, nice setting don't think I could stomach the food again though :("}
{"text":"We went out for dinner and had a great time.  Aaron was the best and most attentive server. He made our night special. Hats off to Aaron! The food was excellent and his service was outstanding. We had a great evening!!"}
{"text":"My whole family went here for dinner in December.  My brothers tend to be picky eaters but neither one had a problem finding something they liked on the menu.  We started with the monster nachos, which my brothers liked despite their dislike for refried beans.  The waitress was also kind enough to make sure the sour cream and guacamole stayed on the side.

For a main course, my mom and I split the wild mushroom and goat cheese enchiladas and the seafood poblano relleno.  Both were to die for.  The enchiladas were perfectly creamy and delicious, and the seafood poblano relleno was the exact right amount of spicy.  The rest of the family was very happy with their meals as well.

I plan to return here the next time I visit the area."}
{"text":"The food and service here are always so awesome! I just tried the signature fundido for the first time and the jalapeño cream cheese that tops it off is to die for! My mom tried the cast iron skillet and its presentation was so nice and pleasing to the eye unlike other Mexican restaurants that just plop everything into the plate and call it a day. Our server, Beau, did an awesome job as well. He made a great recommendation for the peach Melba margarita and was very attentive! Overall, exceedingly happy with this visit! Will definitely keep coming again and again and again!!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the staff was very accommodating and nice.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"New owners?  Bad results . . . 

It was Saturday night and my date and I were looking for good food and an opportunity to catch the ASU game at the bar.  We walked into the bar area and it looked very different from our previous visit.  They went from two bars to one, which in itself wasn't bad, except that the new bar backs up to the window.  So there are no TVs at the bar.  So we grabbed a tall bar table instead.  We were looking for the game and were told that they didn't have a cable package that included the ASU games.  How is this possible?  Also, went to the ladies room and there was no soap, so I had to go to another unisex bathroom to wash my hands.  A man and a woman, who may have been new owners or managers were milling around and not helping anyone, even when it was clear that people were waiting a long time to get service.  In addition, they were showing off their new party room, which looked about as appealing as a party room at Chuckie Cheese.   The party room was hidden by a big piece of plywood that had the restaurant's logo on it.  So amateurish!  Looks like the restaurant was recently taken over by owners (or managers) who simply don't realize that the customer experience is what is important.  And the manager/owners were also sitting at a table in the bar, eating dinner.  As were two of the wait staff, each taking up their own tables.  Now I have no problem with staff eating at the bar, but in most establishments it doesn't take place during busy hours of 8 p.m., and it usually happens at the bar, it is done discreetly.  Something about the whole experience struck me as extremely unprofessional.  We will never come back.  Ever.  Sorry, but I need to watch football at the bar, or in the bar area at least, with some form of service.  And without being stared at and not helped by the management!"}
{"text":"Most enjoyable lunch today at this restaurant. Our server Taylor, was very personable and deficient and we look forward to returning to this restaurant. It is becoming one of our favorite restaurants to go to"}
{"text":"We love coming here because we are able to walk to this location. Growing up in Texas I am used to Tex-mex  from Austin, Houston and San Antonio which is my favorite type of Mexican food. We have also lived in Tucson and enjoy that local cuisine as well. This place is a good melding of the different types of Mexican/American food. The fajitas are great, as well as the enchiladas and tacos. It's fun to sit outside and enjoy a delicious top shelf frozen margarita when the weather is right. They have recently remodeled and we love the inside as well."}
{"text":"Lobster Street Tacos were awesome! Nice portion size for the meal.

I also enjoyed the twist on the chips and salsa, the basket had several different types of chips in it, which was a nice feature."}
{"text":"Went here last week for the first time after moving to the area recently. We had the Saturday shrimp special. I had tacos and husband had the skillet. Tacos were flour tortillas, which I like better than corn, and were really good. Husband loved his shrimp skillet. Vince gave us great service. Husband got a daiquiri that was not to be mistaken for a virgin :-). We told Vince it was our first time there and he brought us a tamale as an appetizer. It was really good. Overall a great first time. Can't wait till the cooler weather to enjoy the patio.

**FYI on your first visit they bring you a free appetizer, it shows up on your bills as credit all the way at the bottom. Don't be an idiot like me and think that you got charged for an app they brought you without asking!**"}
{"text":"For Mexican food, this is just okay.  For Scottsdale mexican food, I guess it could be considered good.

The chips and salsa are very good.  Everything after that was just okay. I ordered the Chili Rellenos and for the most part they were bland and a bit mushy.  The green chili sauce that it was smothered in lacked real flavor. The pork it is was very, very salty.

I hope our waitress was fairly new because she did not know what items were considered vegetarian and then brought out the wrong dish to one of our table mates."}
{"text":"Never been to a restaraunt that is perfect all the time. This one is better than most.

We've been frequenting this place for a coupe of years, and the food is always good to excellent, and so is the service, mostly. The mexican pizza is a favorite. The salsa with the chips is very mild, probably for tourists, and my mom likes it, too. The inferno sauce is not. Mild, that is. Very good spice.

 Flour chips mixed with the others are outstanding. You can get a bag to go if you give them a little notice. 

 My experience is that \"mexican\" food tends to be prepared according to regional tastes. If you're used to Taco Bell, then you will be surprised. Same for Tex/Mex, and New Mexican \"mexican\". 
 
Never liked grease dripping from the burritos, and never been to an American \"mexican\" restaraunt where the plates weren't hot. No grease here, just good food."}
{"text":"This place has been a staple in my life for 22 years now! It's had two owners during that time but the food has always been consistently good. The black cherry frozen sangria is off the chain! I'm a huge fan of the black and bleu salad and the pollo fundido...just yum"}
{"text":"I have been going to Jalapeno Inferno since moving from Chicago almost five years ago. It's the type of restaurant when you have guests from out of town it is the first place you think of taking them. Well today's visit changed everything for me and I hope for many of you out there. We were seated by a girl who was very Curt and unpersonable. ( I was blown away to later find out her name was Danielle and she was actually the manager of the location!) I would think in a restaurant the first person you meet should be happy and chipper unlike her. We were seated immediately and were greeted by two servers. Super bubbly personalities and we definitely thought we would have fun on our visit. My husband and I were very hungry so we requested to have the delicious green chile tamale brought out right away. As we waited we ate some tasty chips and some of the best salsa. Definitely on the mild side but full of flavor. We were joking around with our servers getting ready to place our order when that beautiful tamale was placed on our table. Like I said placed on our table with no mention of it being a hot plate. I placed my order and then went to move the plate closer. I shrieked! Obviously the plate had just come out from the oven and I burnt my thumb index finger and middle finger. The server's scattered like ants. As I watched my fingers start to blister I started to cry. My husband and I waited over 5 minutes with no one coming to assist us or offer any help. My husband got up and went over to a server who brought bandaids over as if that was going to help. Then scattered again. Because of the lack of empathy and with my crying from the excruciating pain we decided to leave. Never had a chance to eat any of the food. As I was leaving my husband went back inside to speak to the manager. She came out with a bottle of Coppertone aloe gel as if that was supposed to help my burnt fingers. I went back inside absolutely Furious from the lack of attention that I received into something that was of a serious nature. I said I wanted the name and manager at the corporate office as well as a phone number. Danielle was so rude and condescending that I ended up raising my voice and throwing a few expletives out. I could not believe in today's age that there was such a lack of customer service and compassion for what was going on at her establishment. Talking back to me in the manner that she did enraged me further. My husband was so shocked by her behavior that he found the number at the corporate office. He spoke with someone who stated she was part owner named Laura. After my husband explained what had happened she actually had the audacity to ask if we paid for our meal. Pay for a meal we did not eat?? All she was concerned about was the bottom line and not her customer. I am so sad to say that after Jalapeno Inferno being my favorite restaurant in Phoenix for years I will no longer go there. I Now understand why the rating has dropped to three stars. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Over a $10 offer, which the restaurant was advertising in store, my sister and I were belittled and patronized.
Rather than doing what any good manager would have done and honoring the offer, this GM decided to give us a rather long business lesson which included telling us to \"think realistically\" and that \"it isn't for people to come in and get free food\".
The most upsetting thing about this is that it was a manager-created problem. I am certain that the owners did not think this is how their patrons would be treated when they developed this offer. They put no minimum purchase requirement or any verbage that might suggest one. The manager just decided we hadn't spent enough to use it. When our waiter asked him for an explination as to why it wouldn't be honored I overheard the manager say, \" I don't know, they just didn't spend enough\". What?! 
My sister and I are both very rational people and I absolutely understand the business surrounding these offers. I understand that on THIS visit they did not make a profit off of us (but my sister has gone in weekly for years!) and having had years of management experience I understand the managers frustration with us using the offer on such a small order. HOWEVER the way that this was handled was incredibly unproffessional. 
From one business proffessional to another I explained to him that the offer should be honored and that if he see's a problem with it he should discuss the verbage in the offer with the owner and try to have it re-written, to which he responded that he would \"take care of [us] this time\" but to know for next time that we need to only use the offers on higher priced tickets, a response I would expect from a fast food manager at best.
A guest should not have to explain to a manager that you don't discuss these matters with your patrons, such matters need to be handled in the back of the house. And of course, whether it is a $5 or $50 ticket guests should be treated with respect. I knew that even before his business lesson."}
{"text":"I came here because it had good reviews, a groupon/living-social voucher, and was craving some Mexican food that is actually spicy because I'm tired of going to restaurants that put that little jalapeno pepper graphic next to an entree only to have be as if they never put any spicy peppers in the darn meal.

Well unfortunately, that was the same case here. My boyfriend loves extremely spicy peppers and ordered an entree off the \"spicy\" list, \"for those who are daring\", and was extremely disappointed. I do like spicy but not as much as him, tried a couple bites of his dish too, and I didn't taste anything spicy.

The reason for the 2 stars is because of expectations; you can't name your restaurant \"Jalapeno Inferno\" and have the spicy dishes taste so boringly unspicy. Now I really am tired of going to restaurants where they promise sweat-induced spiciness but fail to even tickle my taste buds."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I saw it on google maps as my husband and I were driving by and I knew as soon as I saw the name that I wanted to try it out while in the area.

Our server was very friendly and helpful, which automatically earns two stars in my book. 

The chips and salsa were fantastic! The basket of chips was a combination of corn tortilla chips and flour tortilla chips. We both filled up on those evil calories before our meals arrived.

I read a lot about the tamales and our server raved about the spinach enchiladas so I ordered a combo with the two. The tamale was ok, but to be fair I've never really been I to them. The spinach enchilada, however, was the best I've ever eaten, and as a vegetarian I've had a lot. The sauce was yummy, the creamy spinach filling was incredible and the sliced almonds on the top  made the whole thing even better. The husband ordered the Nuevo Mexico enchiladas and they were, in his words, \"hotter than the blazes of hell\". Good, but we had to stop at the Safeway next door for Tums."}
{"text":"Came here with friends and their sons that are both under the age of 5.  Nice restaurant with plenty of choices and really good food.  The staff was patient with the requests for the kids and services was quick.  Worth another trip for sure."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with Jalapeño Inferno. We have gone several times and generally enjoyed the food so I decided to take some out of town guests there for lunch. The server was awful. Ignored us and acted like he was too good to wait on us. The food was overly sweet and did not have much flavor. I was embarrassed. We will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I like the complex this restaurant is located in which makes for good outdoor patio seating, weather permitting. I cant review the entrees as I went for a happy hour in a large group so tried only a couple of finger foods. The guac was good and salsa flavorful. However, no way was the spice level  anywhere close to what the restaurant name suggests, a relief for the faint of heart , might be disappointing for those looking for the kick."}
{"text":"My fiance and I made a tradition to come here every Friday night. The service was great, chips and salsa were to die for, but my fiance found a long hair in his food. As much as I miss and love this place, I will never coming here again."}
{"text":"You guys this is our go to mexican restaurant, like atleast once every 2 weeks. 
Their chips are beyond delicious, and if i dont stop my self i could an entire basket of their flour chips. To me their salsa is just okay. 

However if they only had their chips and Verde spinach enchiladas on their menu, i would still continue going as often as we do. The best spinach enchiladas !! I do wish they had more speciality vegetarian options, but they do have enough. There are options on the menu for everyone and large portions, usually enough for next day's lunch. 

This place has good margaritas, top shelf is my favorite.  And if thats not your thing, they have a full bar.  Does happy hour, 1/2 price appetizers during happy hour. Also features a new tequilia each month i believe, and seasonsonal speacials (hatch chilies). 

The staff if friendly, knowledgable, and usually the owners or management team drops by to ask on your experience. 

I will keep coming back !"}
{"text":"Great food and service!! I was referred to this place and I am so glad we came. Definitely try the Tamatillo enchiladas and the fried ice cream ;)"}
{"text":"Am I taking crazy pills???!!!!! Four stars???? Really????  I think there needs to be some sort of quiz before being allowed to write reviews......  It could be as simple as: How many fingers am I holding up? Who was the first president of the United States? Or, have you ever eaten Mexican food before?

So based on its proximity to my home and the four star reviews from yelpers, we gave it a go. Was it completely terrible? No. But come on guys, call it what it is. This place is no better than an El Torito. Frankly, you are way better off to go to Baja Fresh, take it home, make your own margarita and save 50 bucks...

I had the carne asada fundido. Basically its like an under-fried chimi with steak and sauteed peppers and onions inside and sour cream on top. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't shitty, but there just isn't anything to sing about. Utterly average... 

Traveling for work a lot, I get to eat in a lot of great cities. The only reason I mention that is that in many cities, if you open an \"ok\" restaurant, it is closed inside a year. You just can't survive if you are this average. I have had better mexican food in Seattle for god's sake....SEATTLE!!!!!!! There are more mexican americans in this town that the entire population of Washington State.... Is it possible that the only good mexican food in this town comes from place where you have to stand in line to order?"}
{"text":"My favorite TexMex restaurant!  Great food.  Large menu."}
{"text":"Words I would use to describe this restaurant: generic, bland, boring, underwhelming.  There is nothing exciting about this place except maybe the descriptions of the entrees, which falsely made everything sound wonderful.  I ordered the Green Hatch Chile Enchiladas, which was listed on a portion of the menu that contained a warning about the spice-level.  The entree was described as slow-roasted pork carnitas enchiladas in a spicy green hatch chile sauce.  First of all, not spicy at all - really, I would have felt fine feeding this to my one-year-old.  There was definitely not slow-roasted anything in the dish - just cubes of unflavored meat.  And the hatch chile sauce?  I am pretty sure that it was from a can - the type you find at the grocery store.  My wife was equally disappointed with her entree."}
{"text":"My husband and I are locals and come to Jalapeño Inferno frequently, but just today our excellent server, Cyvanah, shared with us about yelp. We travel a lot and have never used yelp but after she told us we immediately went home and checked it out. 

We have never had a bad experience at Jalapeño Inferno, just today my husband and I sat on the beautiful patio. He had some enchiladas with an ice cold beer, and I had a salad with a top shelf margarita, everything was outstanding as usual. 

We recommend this Mexican food to everyone we know and have never heard a complaint back. It is most certainly a place to spend your time. Food, drinks, service, they offer it all!"}
{"text":"(Make a reservation!)

We decided to try this place on a recommendation from a partner at my Fiancés firm(I guess he knows the owners). He knew we loved rhythm and wine so he absolutely insisted we try their other restaurant too.. So glad we did!

The guys both had inferno burritos which they loved but were taken aback by the heat, still really enjoyed the dish though.

I had the smoky pork hatch quesadilla which was delicious and had just the right amount of heat considering the hatch chiles. 

Chips and salsa were fantastic, we all love flour tortilla chips when we find them. It's a nice surprise and a good deviation from boring corn tortilla chips. Drinks were also great, we had the \"special\" of the evening which was a Tangerita. Tasted like a tangy orange creamsicle!

The only thing keeping from a 5star rating was the service. We made a reservation and although we were a few minutes tardy, there still seemed to be great confusion as to where we were to be sat. I can only assume the hosts were feeling a bit overwhelmed there must have been 25 people waiting to sit. Then our server, JJ, was at first hyper attentive coming for drink and food orders twice before we even had a chance to look at the menu. Then brought the check before dinner was even through and we dodnt see her again for wuite some time. We had planned on another round of cocktails and some dessert but she had already brought the check. Once we finished dinner she asked if we were ready to pay?? We said no we would like to see a dessert menu to which she responded \"oh well I don't need to bring the menu, I can just tell them to you\" which she did, in mediocre detail. She asked if we still wanted dessert and we said of course, we ordered a TA-COokie (their version the pizzookie) and were going to order a second dessert as their were two couples but she insisted it was enough to share for the 4 of us, then walked away. Still not offering another round of drinks.

The TA-COokie was just OK , severely undercooked even for being a pizzookie but who doesn't like raw cookie dough? We ate the whole thing any way.

Overall we had a great experience, being in the restaurant business I know sometimes servers just lose their steam towards the end of a shift, but it's always good when the quality of food outweighs the service and in this case it more than made up for it. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this place after all my friends ranted about it and although this place is very nice with a great ambiance, the food did not match. The service was good except for the fact that I didn't know who my server was. The food seemed as if it's all out of of a bag or can with little to no seasoning . The margaritas how ever were amazing and they best part"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in town!
Killer chips and great Margaritas."}
{"text":"My wife and I and our friends have been here many times over the past couple of years for dinner or happy hour and have totally enjoyed the food and dining experience. Tonight, however, was a huge disappointment. We wanted 20 minutes for a table, followed by a 40 minute wait for our food. 

My wife's salad looked like it had just been washed and was served wet - yuck! 

I ordered a fajita, The meat was grossly over-cooked and served on a bed of sautéed onions with just a single slick of red pepper, a teaspoon of lettuce, 3 of the greasiest fajita wraps ever seen rolled up in tin foil and a small amount of shredded check melted into a clump and unusable.

The waitress had way too many tables and was less than attentive to the diners in our section. A guest at a neighboring table winched when served her food as a good deal of it was hanging off the edge of the plate looking like the kitchen just slopped it on. 

When we politely spoke with the waitress about our meal she became defensive and offered no apology. Before receiving the check the manager stopped by to ask how our dinner was, he too was defensive and had a \"so what\" demeanor. Neither the waitress or the manager apologized which was very disappointing.

We know they can do better because they have! 

Maybe it's time to call Gordon Ramsey for a rescue!!!"}
{"text":"Jalapenos has been our go to Mexican joint since the late 1900's. Many restaurants have come and gone in this neighborhood, Jalapenos has staying power. The staff are all very friendly and helpful, and our glasses are always full! The owner/manager usually stops by our table at the end of our meal to make sure everything was good, and it always is!

The chips and salsa are amazing! What sets them apart is that the chips are a combination of both corn chips and flour chips. Not just the standard corn chips like in most Mexican restaurants. The salsa is fresh and delish with the perfect amount of cilantro.

I think between my husband and I, we have ordered just about everything on the menu and it has all been very good. Also, if for some crazy reason you find yourself there and don't feel like Mexican food, the Jalapeño burger is fantastic. If you have room for desert, try the Flan! It is absolutely the best flan I have ever had, anywhere! It has a lovely smooth creamy consistency, simply perfect!

I highly recommend Jalapeños as a great Mexican family restaurant."}

Will be back every time we are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Have been going to this restaurant for quite sometime.  The food is fairly consistent, and they have a cute outoor patio with a small 'creek' and sometimes live entertainment.  It's nice to see a couple familiar faces (one waitress and one waiter in particular) working over the years.  Both are friendly and attentive.  It seems there have been some adjustments to the menu over the years, which I understand, but I miss some of my old favorites.  My husband likes their chips and salsa.  Overall, a thumbs up."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are always on the search for good and truly spicy food, and when we saw the living social coupon for Jalapeño Inferno, we were pretty intrigued.  Unfortunately our experience was very underwhelming.  After a long wait before seeing a waitress, we ordered a couple of their \"premium\" margaritas, which we both thought were just okay, a little on the sour side, and overall, lacked balance.  We ordered the smoked pork quesadilla and the Texas style enchiladas to split for dinner.  It always bugs us a bit when something is listed as \"not for the faint of heart\" due to it's spiciness, and it comes out medium spicy at best.  The management is super nice, and offered to buy us an app for our initial wait.  One of the managers also recommended a puréed hatch child sauce which made things much better, and had a nice kick, but we felt this should have been somehow infused in the dishes.   Ambiance was kind of all over the place, and we would have liked to have had some more traditional Mexican type of music as opposed to the pop channel they had on.  Service seemed to be good around us, but I think that our server was just over sat, and forgot about us after our food came out.  Over all, we wouldn't recommend this for spicy food enthusiasts or authentic Mexican food connoisseurs, but we think that it'd probably be a good place for families."}
{"text":"Man I'm not gonna lie I think this place is great. Just started going here since I moved to this side of town and it's my new favorite.
1) the food is awesome. Barbacoa tacos or the Courtney burrito! Oh and ask for a side of hatch sauce. The waitress Shannon recommend it to me! So awesome! 

2) get a boss! It's a margarita. And it's good and strong. Pretty much it's a boss.. Get it! The bartender, I think Paige is her name. She's the best, makes the drink so on point and incredible friendly, which is always nice!

If you can make it here I recommend it."}
{"text":"I have finally found my favorite Mexican restaurant.  Food has great Flavor and the hotter sauce was good enough to drink although I had to ask for it. The service was impeccable, they kept both my diet Coke glass filled and the hot sauce coming. Now for the good stuff.  The top shelf margarita was wonderful and if I wasn't driving I would have had at least three. They served a mix of chips, both came out hot. The corn chips were standard, but the flour ones were more fluffy and addicting.

I can't wait to go back.

{"text":"Try the frozen margarita swirled with black-cherry sangria....tasty and generously spiked with alcohol. Ask for the hotter salsa (a bit brownish compared to the standard red one they bring)... Tostada and green corn tamale were good. Service was prompt and friendly. Atmosphere is inviting, comfortable. I will be back."}
{"text":"Always awesome service and great food! Our server Beau always has the best smile and suggestions off the menu 
I tried a chimichanga with shredded chicken, it had so much flavor, and my cucumber melon margarita.... wish I had more!!!! Thank you for being the best Mexican restaurant ever!!"}
{"text":"My sister and I were going to a move at Desert Ridge yesterday but wanted to grab some lunch first, we are Mexican food junkies, and since the only option at Desert Ridge was Rubio's, we decided to head a bit further North and go to Jalapenos. 

While I don't get here very often, I always am happy when I do. First off, the chips are awesome. The give you a mixed basket of corn and flour tortilla chips. Now I like tortilla chips in every shape and form, but the flour tortilla chips are a rarity, and when I see them, I pounce! They are so rich, they melt in your mouth, and are heavenly with the fresh, chunky salsa. 

I have had many things here, enchiladas, tacos, Mexican pizza, all of which are very good. I would really recommend the shredded beef, it is very moist and flavorful. I decided to try the spinach enchiladas yesterday, to see how they compared to my favorite ones at Arribas. I have to say, they were very different than the ones at Arribas, but they were very good. First off, they use a flour tortilla instead of corn, and they fill it with spinach and cheese, then cover them in read sauce with a dollop of their spinach con queso on top and sprinkled with sliced almonds. It is a very unique enchilada...and very yummy. 

The chips are what keep calling me back to here....but the rest of the food never disappoints either!"}
{"text":"That was the best chile relleno plate I have ever had, cam with a beef and cheese with green chili sauce all over.  It has become the new standard for all chile rellenos, the only problem is that now I don't really care for them anywhere else."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! The food was amazing, the service was very good,  and the chips and salsa are soooo good! We were also given a complimentary sweet corn tamale which were surprisingly delicious. We didn't have any margaritas but the iced tea was passion fruit-my favorite! For lunch I had the chicken tacos and my husdand had the chicken enchiladas. They were both very good, portion size was perfect, and we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican restaurant since my old one unexpectedly closed down a few months ago. Little did I know there was another within 10 minutes from my home. Happy hour is insane. The margaritas are amazing and everything we ate was delicious. The restaurant is beautiful and staff is very nice which I didn't expect because of the area. The only downside is that it doesn't feel like its very authentic.  My husband and I are still going to be regulars for sure."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Great chips and salsa - the tamales were to die for - and I loved the shrimp tacos. 

I'm a fan and will come back again soon!"}
{"text":"(After not having a good experience at the other place owned by the same person...being insulted by bartender) My boyfriend and I wanted mexican food. The owner of both this place and Rythym and Wine, should reconsider the hiring process of the staff. We walked in around 8 pm, well before closing. The staff could have cared less and were just wanting to get ot of there. The food was good, but we will never go back to either place, not matter how cool the lights in the trees are!"}
{"text":"Yum! Great food, reasonable prices and very generous drinks. I've been here twice so far, and I WILL be back!!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place for Mexican food.  Great service, atmosphere, and the food  was outstanding! I would recommend this restaurant!    I have been  in Scottsdale 6 months and have eaten here 7-8 times!   Always delighted to take friends or family members to this great restaurant! :-)"}
{"text":"Waitress was great.  Taco was good.  Not so good enchilada, burrito, beans.
Sick most of the night."}
{"text":"Cassie was one of the best servers ever.   The food arrived quickly and was soo tasty.   I shared the green corm tamales (a tad thick but huge and yummy) and the black and blue salad (fantastic steak salad).    Margaritas were good especially the house for only $6.00.   We are visiting this area but would go back again and again if we were locals just to try more of their dishes!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Amazing selection of margaritas and a huge food menu.  Everything we've tried has been good to great.  Living in the area makes it a weekly visit for us!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants. The fajitas are amazing and the atmosphere is good too. The patio and the bar area are great. Good happy hour and margaritas too. The black and blue chicken salad is my go to for lunch! I saw they are opening a new location in DC Ranch which is closer to me so I'm excited to try the new location ."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch. Street tacos were excellent. Frozen Sangria was one of the best drinks ever. My wife says the flan is the best she's had. The patio is well laid out and spacious. Finally our server, Karlie made it a great day."}
{"text":"Hate doing this but I will probably never come back here. The food was decent but the service was anything but. My food and drink came out very quick but the overall attitude of the staff was very disappointing. My server couldn't have cared less about my experience. Won't name any names but people should not be in this industry if they have bad attitudes and completely turn off their clientele. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Connor was a wonderful server, super sweet and helpful. And tall. And handsome. 

Food was good, fried ice cream was the best part

But...towards the end of our meal, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye...I look over...and a server is training two very large, extremely exposed breasts. So much for a family restaurant right?

By the way I think they're fake. 
And we are not lesbians."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly, and I wasn't in the mood for something heavy. So I braved something from their lighter fare menu (I say brave because not a lot of Mexican food places offer good healthy menu options). I ordered the roasted poblano green chile stuffed with chicken and black beans and topped with pomegranate seeds. It was surrounded by some puree   that was amazing! (I can't find the Lite fare options on the online menu, so I don't know what it was) The flavors were complicated, but went well together, and was unlike anything that I've ever tasted! I was pleasantly surprised and I loved it!  I even tried a bit of the jalapeño fundido, which was really good but definitely heavy. It all came out very quickly, the service was good, and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love the bar for a casual dinner. The chips include flour and corn tortillas, yum. Salsa is garlicky but good, most menu items are tasty and some are even a little imaginative for a Mexican restaurant. Best of all, the servers are always super sweet. One of our favorites for sure."}
{"text":"If you're in the parking lot and starving go for it. Otherwise not really worth a trip.
Not bad but just typical, average, mediocre. Menu does have variety - but again you've  had it all before. Wait staff - slightly below average."}
{"text":"Plating was nice.  Tex-mex more than super authentic.  Loved the chips, salsas, sampler platter, and the specialty drinks.  The barbacoa tacos were chicken and being a lazy food lover, I just saw Barbacoa and tacos and didn't read any further.  Wasn't expecting Chicken at all - expected beef cheek or some kind of shreaded beef. But, overall pretty dang yummy and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Condescending attitude by long time bartender.  Came by my table to see how i was doing and asked,  \"How are you doing, young lady?\"  I am over 60 and took offense to her unprofessional and condescending use of \"young lady\".  Mentioned this to the manager (a young blonde woman) who came by to collect my tab.  She said staff are told not to address customers in such a way and she would mention this to the bartender.  Obviously, lessons in how to treat customers are not being taken seriously and need to be reinforced at the Scottsdale location.  Many (if not most) of their customers are nearly-senior or senior citizens."}
{"text":"I went here with some girlfriends last weekend and everything was great! We had great service and the food was amazing. Cocktails and drinks were tasty and if you go one must try the Black Cherry Sangria! 
Their staff was helpful and friendly and very patient as we took almost 2 hours to order!
The only complaints are that parking is a disaster and they are only open until 10p on the weekends which is very inconvenient."}
{"text":"Been dining here off and on for many years and have desperately wanted this place to become my favorite. However, the food and service are erratic at best and the prices on the menu keep increasing significantly. The food is not true Sonoran style Mexican food -  it's a variation that is lacking flavor. On my last visit, I realize the prices of most items have increased a couple of dollars again. I'm moving on and giving up. There are far better Mexican restaurants in the north east valley."}
{"text":"Best flan around!
The only reason they didn't receive 5 stars is because the oil container (of the oil and vinegar) was very messy  from a previous patron.  Should have been cleaned between uses."}
{"text":"Great food with great prices. Loved the hatch green Chile enchiladas. The ambience is good - eating outside is nice. Good service - our server,  Steven, was on target for meal! Highly recommended - would love to come back on our next visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I'm not sure who's writing awesome reviews, they are either not familiar with good Mexican food or they are being paid to write this stuff. The food was some of the worse Mexican food I've ever had. They are busy only because there are not many choices in North Scottsdale. Trust me, it's worth the drive to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I can see why people love the tamales, but they weren't 'my cup of tea.' Instead I was very impressed with the section of their menu that focused on spicy items. I ordered the burrito with inferno sauce in it. Finally, something that would sting and linger. I like this place a lot and so does everyone else in my family ( immediate and extended)."}
{"text":"We just landed from Chicago, need a quick bite, ordered their tamales, with side of fresh avacadoes & fresh jalepenos.  WOW on tamales.  Can't wait to go back and get that again and try something else on mwnu"}
{"text":"This is a terrible restaurant. It all tasted like it came out of a can. Do not waste your time or money. Our server was very good however."}
{"text":"We love the sweet corn tamales here. We used our free YELP coupon for the guacamole. It was very good too. The  basket of chips contains both corn and flour chips. We chose to sit outside near the pond, fountain & bushes. It was very refreshing. The music can be a little \"rocky\" for us. I would prefer more relaxing music outside. Our server Tyler was very attentive & pleasant.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. We come here all of the time. I love the Sea of Cortez Fajitas. (All of their fajitas are good). The green corn tamales are tasty. The quesadilla cobb salad is great at lunch. Their chips and salsa are awesome! (They serve both corn and flour chips). My husband is obsessed with the Ta-Co'okie, the ice cream cookie dessert. All the servers are really nice. I love this place!"}
{"text":"We recently moved to this side of town and was happy to find a good Mexican restaurant nearby.  We always get the fajitas (shrimp/chicken and steak/chicken) both have always been really good and they will do lettuce wraps if you prefer.  The mgmt is very friendly and accommodating!  The salsa is great, glad it close-we go regularly."}
{"text":"This was my first and last experience at Jalapeno Inferno.   It was Horrible!!! If I could, I would have given it less than one star.  It started right from the beginning when the hostess brought us to our table. The busboy was still wiping it down and sweeping under the table, and we had to wait while he cleaned up someone else's slop.  The hostess then  placed the menus on the table and was gone before we were even seated..Micheal our waiter was not very attentive from the get go..  His first stop at our table was very untimely and he was not very engaging.   Upon receiving  our food  I immediately noticed my beans and rice appeared as though they had been sitting under a heat lamp for some time.  The edges were  burnt and the top of the rice was crispy and dried out. The beans were also dried out.  It was very obvious and I really cant believe someone had the nerve to set the plate in front of me.   It took several minutes to get my waiters attention so I could finally return it for another meal and  ten minutes or more to get a replacement .   By that time, my guests were already done with their meals.  The food was waaay too salty and the portions not that big .  In the end, I saved my quests the embarrassment of calling the manager over and placing a complaint, however now I wished I had.    Do yourself a favor and skip this place."}
{"text":"Average food and average service. I like this place because it's close and will go here again, but I would not honestly think of taking a group or a guest here. Other places near here have more \"must go\" appeal. The Anaheim rellenos were pretty good and of course the fluffy chips are great, but I have never had a memorable dish here.

Although we have been here 5-6 times, we just noticed that they have changed  the decor and have a better tequila menu. So, I guess that means we never go inside... The patio is very cool when they have the guitar duet playing there, but I think that is the only reason I would come back."}
{"text":"Fantastic and Consistent neighborhood restaurant.  
Super friendly...ask about the Green Corn Tamale if it's your first visit...YUM!"}
{"text":"It was a rainy day, so being the kind person that I am, I agreed to drive my wife to My Sister's Closet in North Scottsdale.  She thought I was wonderful, until she saw that there was a Hornaceks Golf Store in the same shopping center.  Imagine, she questioned my motives!!  So to make it up to her, I took her to Jalapeno Inferno Bistro Mexicana.  

We just happened to time it so that we were seated immediately.  We were  given chips and a red salsa, which was rather bland.  When the waiter found out that we had never been there before, we were also given a free sweet green corn tamale.  It was quite good, but not quite what I was looking for.  I wanted HEAT.  So I asked him if they had a hotter salsa.  He brought out their hot salsa, which still wasn't very hot - so then I asked for a side of fresh chopped jalapeno peppers.  After adding that to the salsa, it began to have a little heat to it.

After looking through the menu, my wife decided that she liked the tamale so well, she ordered two more of them off the appetizer menu.  The menu was quite extensive, and had a lot of choices.  I finally decided on the Enchiladas Nuevo Mexico, off of the \"Some Like It Hot\" section of the menu.  My wife was very happy with the sweet corn tamale.  I thought the enchiladas were very good, but still lacking in the hot factor.  So it was simple - I added more fresh jalapenos, and that helped it a lot.

So all in all, it was a good experience.  The service was excellent, the bistro was quite attractive on the inside, and the food was above average.  I always drink Dos Equis Amber, so I can't judge the wine or mixed drinks.  My only complaint was that with \"inferno\" in the name,  they should allow at least an option of spicing up the salsa or entrees.

At  best, the salsa was bland, and the enchiladas, while spicy, were not \"hot\".  I thought my expectations might have been to high based on the name, but my wife, who is not fond of \"hot\" foods, also thought the food somewhat bland.

But, of course, the best part was that my wife did forgive me for visiting the golf shop.  That made it worth the trip."}
{"text":"I'm a picky eater and and thought the steak fundido was great.  Order a Boss margarita with this and you are guaranteed to enjoy your experience.  I would have given them 5 stars but the wait was frustrating.  We were told 20 minutes which really ended up being almost an hour.

One of their bartenders was our waiter and he did a great job turning our frowns upside down."}
{"text":"One of the poorest service experiences I've ever had. We sat outside and we were told they would turn on the outdoor heaters for us. After sitting there for about 10 minutes with no drinks and no waiter/waitress yet, someone finally came out to take the drink orders but did not turn on the heater. We asked 3 times before the manager finally came out and tried to start it. It did not start, so he removed the propane and came back 10 minutes later with a new tank which did not work either. He never once acknowledged/apologized during this time. He finally gave up and walked away without a word and apologized only at the end of the meal. Also the tortillas were rock hard."}
{"text":"This is my first review on yelp and it was my first time to Jalapeno Inferno but it was so AWESOME, I had to share my experience!
Just had lunch there with my girlfriend.  We started with margaritas, I had the \"the Boss,\" which is their version of a skinny marg.  It was light and fresh and strong too.  We tried their guacamole and not only was it really tasty but it was a big portion as well.  For lunch I had their seafood enchiladas which our server recommended and they were amazingly good, nicely topped with a tomatillo salsa - spicy but not too spicy.  And we enjoyed their cookie dessert, baked warm with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.
All the food was fabulous but really the best part of our lunch was the friendly service by not only our server but the whole staff we interacted with.  Our server was really special though.
I'll definitely be returning again soon!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Jalapeno Inferno Bistro Mexicano, or Jalapeno's as \"we\" call it, many times and I have to say that they have never disappointed.  My personal faves are (not necessarily in this order) their mango margarita, flour chips--be sure to try those!, awesome guacamole and salsa -I'm into the hot & spicy so for me the hotter the better & if you're like me don't expect their \"hot\" to be \"hot\".  When it is Hatch chile season, be sure to try the Stuffed Hatch Chile, it is to die for!  Again, even though it has the little symbol for \"hot/spicy\" next to it, it isn't.  Just realize that this is coming from someone who uses ghost pepper salsa on darned near everything...  Nice ambiance, friendly staff and they are very accommodating with my special dietary requests, which can lead to waitperson eye-rolls but never here.  You've got to try the flour chips, they're the bomb!"}
{"text":"This is everything a Mexican restaurant should be!! Awesome chips and salsa (too good) and clean, fast, friendly place. All the entrees are awesome. The hatch green chilis are super spicy and good. Highly recommended the Grande Burrito with red chile beef, the Hatch Green Chile Enchiladas and the Hatch Cheese Skillet appetizer!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the attraction with this place is, The food was terrible it was low quality food. I order guacamole and it was over salted probably to disguise the fact that the avocados were bad  and the nachos where heavily deep fried with oil dripping of them. I ordered  a burrito and asked the waitress if it was really spicy she told me no, well that was the biggest lie I just think she wanted to see me in pain sicko. I can normal handle spicy but this was to much  i was sweating my nose was running and my mouth was on fire half way threw it I felt an overwhelming urge to throw my brains up had to run to the bathroom. After I ran out of there I went home and threw up some more and went to sleep the next morning I had really bad stomach pains and diarrhea for about 2 hrs lets just say I lost about 20 lbs, so if anyone is thinking about going here eat at your own risk. All these people saying its great I don't understand maybe its because they are drunk I don't drink so its all about the food with me and in my book failing miserably."}
{"text":"The Scottsdale Rd Jalapeño Inferno used to be our favorite Mexican restaurant, and we have recommended it to many friends.  Not any more.  Things have changed, and both we and friends have noticed.  Some of it concerns Happy Hour and where it applies - used to be the entire restaurant and patio - now only the bar and bar patio area, which adjoins the  restaurant patio.  We had a party of 6 seated on the patio next to the bar patio, weren't aware of the changed Happy Hour, and were refused Happy Hour prices.  Rather than picking everything up and moving, we left and went to another restaurant.   On a recent previous occasion, we were served food that had been under the heat lamps too long and a waitress that was less than friendly.  Something has changed at this JI, and not for the better."}
{"text":"You must try the sweet corn tamale! That is a great way to start the meal. It is almost a desert it is so sweet. 

The place is is the corner of a strip mall but the scenery is more then just the parking lot. The chips and salsa, always the measuring stick of a good Mexican restaurant, were perfect. Thick chip/tortillas and spicy salsa. Mmmmmm. 

The food was delicious.  All our entrees had plenty of heat so order lots of water. The chicken enchiladas I ordered from the spicy menu delivered a good kick.  They were juicy, flavorful and now they are gone. My wife's salad was fresh. She ordered the spicy ranch dressing which came on the side. Good thing because it made her nose run it was so hot. 

 Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Great find in N. Scottsdale. Chips are cooked in-house. Very good. Had the Hatch Chili pork enchiladas. Just enough heat to get your attention. Probably best enchiladas I've eaten.  My daughter got the seafood enchiladas which were a little different than what you typically find, and were very good also. Service was very good especially since it was a very busy Friday night. Planning to go back before I leave."}
{"text":"I have wanted something different and jalapeños did not disappoint, our waiter(Tommy) was courteous,fast, and informative, since it was are first time, Tommy started us off with a comp. sweet tamale that was very good and I will order as an appetizer, I ordered steak fajitas, which were brought to the table sizzling hot and came with rice and beans nicely displayed, everything was very tasty, and the chips and salsa are also very good, I will be eating there again very soon, Enjoy"}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon.  First time there. Had the spicy green chili bowl and friend had fish tacos. Food impressed both of us. Service was excellent as well. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Less than impressed, again.  Mexican food is not that complicated, and they continue to  bring dishes with  bland flavor profiles.  I had the green chile pork burritos, the meat was dry and grainey in texture,  as if had been cooked this AM and sat in a warming tray all day,  then rolled in a tortilla and covered in Verde sauce.  It was recommended by our waitress as one of there better dishes.   The mgr passed by our table 10 times and never greeted use, nor did I see him greet any tables all night.  They seem to be on cruise control, which is a very dangerous attitude for a restaurant or anyone in the hospitality business.  I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best Frozen Black Cherry Sangria ever! This drink alone is enough to get back here week after week. But the food is fantastic; they have flour tortilla chips! Salsa is fantastic, everything I have ordered is great (try the combo plates, or their specialty hatch chili recipes). Great place to take any Mexican food loving friend :)"}
{"text":"Me and my wife visited the restaurant for the first time. It was after church and it was mothers day. We called ahead and they informed us of the buffet. We asked about regular menu she said yes it was still available. We were seated and 45 minutes went by, no server. We finally stopped someone and they acted as if we were bothering them. 25 more minutes passed then we had a server. She informed us that buffet was 19 dollars adult, 9 dollars children. I said i wanted a regular un-sweet tea. and they gave my family there drinks. We walked to the buffet......disgusting. I have had lunch at my daughters school with better food. Also there was food everywhere on the floor etc... I was not eating that. My tea comes and it is a raspberry passion fruit....What??? I am ready to leave. I have no food and my bill is at 80 dollars and everybody at the table has had a omelet.  I asked that my tea be taken back and  I stuck with water. A lady with \"WHITE FRAMED GLASSES\" came to the table and asked how we were doing? I said not good. I told her how our experience was going she shushed me and started to explain to me how the buffet worked my daughter was telling her \"excuse me, excuse me.\" she shushed her then also. She was so rude my wife is now ready to go. We asked to speak with a manager and Jeff came over, he was great. My wife was crying that is how bad of an experience this was. This woman with the WHITE FRAMED GLASSES should be fired. She absolutely was rude and disgusting.  MY WIFE WAS CRYING on mothers day, after church. The only positives were Jeff the manager and the water. Seriously omelets at a mexican restaurant. I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"We have been several times. Service has been good, food is ok for quick Mexican.
Tonight, we started out ok until the flys took over. Seriously, pick up your  drink and brush the fly off, pick up you taco and a fly is on it. We spent the time we were there waving our hands around. When I told the manager, she said, yes, we know. \" They keep coming in when the doors open and close. \" Last time I checked, all restaurants have doors. The glass door by our table was covered with flys.

Gross, will not be back, especially after that lame response."}
{"text":"Husband and I took the in-laws here and he has been back since. Love the sweet corn tamales - if you go, you must try these. Also, the margaritas are very good. I really enjoyed my shrimp enchiladas. They had almost a dozen shrimp in them, which was great, b/c it drives me nuts when you get a shrimp dish with like three shrimp in it. I mean, they are called shrimp, by their nature they are small, so putting three in a shrimp dish is counter intuitive. Husband enjoyed the street tacos, which were also excellent. 

Jalapeno Inferno is also nice for its sedate atmosphere. Unlike a lot of other Mexican places, there is a refreshing lack of colorful parrots, which makes it perfect for a nice dinner with out of towners, esp. those who already feel that everything Arizona must feature cacti."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Jalapeno Inferno for lunch last weekend and were not very impressed. The restaurant and the patio are nice looking but the food was not as appealing. 

The salsa and chips were \"okay.\"  I wasn't a fan of the chips. I know that many people do but I found the texture to be similar to \"Cinnamon Twists\" at Taco Bell. I prefer crispier chips. But, my husband was a fan so I guess it's just personal preference. 

My husband had the Hatch Green Chile Enchiladas and I had the Anaheim Chile Relleno Platter. I did not like my meal. I could only eat a few bites of the Chile Relleno but I did enjoy my rice and beans. My husband enjoyed his enchiladas but they were not as hot as advertised since they are listed under the \"some like it hot\" portion of the menu. 

They main reason I am giving this restaurant two stars is because of the lack of service. We rarely saw our waitress and the restaurant did not appear busy. She never asked if we needed anything and never refilled our water or beverages. She took our order, dropped off our bill, but never provided any service in between those two events."}
{"text":"I am a Mexican foodaholic. Jalapeno Inferno is one of the better Mexican food restaurants in North Phoenix/Scottsdale. The restaurant is quite busy so be prepared to wait if you come right around dinner time. They have excellent chips and salsa, the food is flawless and the prices aren't bad either."}
{"text":"Best chips in town!! I go for the chips.  There salsa is different, I love it.  I usually order the fundidos when I go there.  Great place.  If you go for lunch, the price is more reasonable."}
{"text":"The good: 
Great patio, and service.
The bad: 
Bland food. I've had better Mexican. food at any On The Border. Atmosphere? Head banger hard rock and Mexican restaurant. Uh, no, I don't think so. The owner's apparently like that music, we were told, and lock the controls so it can't be changed. Great for them. It's their restaurant after all, but not exactly what you expect in a Mexican restaurant.
We've tried Jalapeno's a number of time over the years hoping it would get better, but it's only gotten worse. This was our last try."}
{"text":"The food was very good, It was a month or so back so I forgot what I ordered but it was on the customers favorites section ( It's no longer there.) It was some kind of enchilada with goat cheese and chicken and spinach and mushrooms, etc... Really great! My boyfriend ordered what was stated on the menu as a 13 inch burrito but we thought maybe they brought him the wrong food item. Although it was super tasty (no complaints about the taste), It was only about a 7 inch burrito, so way smaller then stated on the menu or expected. Good service, a nice menu, obviously they change the menu up, which is also a plus. When we went, they were speaking of opening a great wine bar we'd like to try. The chips and salsa were very good! We will go back after we try out a few more Mexican restaurants. The one nice plus about Scottsdale is the selection of places to eat is so HUGE we have the great pleasure of finding a trying out so many great places such as this!"}
{"text":"Used to definitely be one of my favorite restaurants but after tonight I'm absolutely done. I drove and picked up take out, and whoever packed it up shoved all the food, included queso, salsas and tacos into one bag, which ultimately broke when I got home and tried to pick it up, leaving my queso and salsas spilled all over the floor and my tacos on the floor as well. I called to complain about the lack of carefulness when packing, and ultimately got nowhere and just left it. Then, when I went to eat my taco I noticed the color was a bit odd and it seems to be that my chicken was somewhat raw. I'm just so disappointed because this place has always been great, and I don't know if they just had a bad night or what."}
{"text":"I used to go to Jalapenos many years ago before they had a fire.  My friend and I checked it out tonight and were pleasantly surprised.  The layout is completely different, the menu is much more extensive and expensive ( OK though).  Our waitress JJ was right on the ball with drinks and our food order.  I had the shrimp tacos and they were quite good.  My friend had the seafood enchilada and said it was very good also.  We have one complaint though, and it's a big one for us.  This was something we didn't notice until after we ordered and the food arrived.  The people behind us had a dog in the restaurant and it wasn't a service dog.  The dog was medium sized and in some kind of nylon carrier with screened sides, and an open unzipped top.  When we mentioned to our waitress that it's against the law she said \"Oh, it's OK it's in a carrier\".  That did it for us, we will never go back there again. Instead of 3 or 4 stars we give it a one because of the dog."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great! My husband and I were visiting Scottsdale for a few days and it was suggested by locals we check out this place. Everything we ordered was awesome. We were given a complimentary tamale for being first timers and wow, it was amazing.  The fajitas and enchiladas were delicious entrees as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite spots for good Mexican food. While it may not be the best it is certainly good. We have tried a number of dishes ranging from fajitas to salads. Their chips and salsa are amazing. The margaritas are the reason we keep coming back. Lol."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this place as it is close to our home and the food is very good. Not your typical mexican food. We have never been disappointed by the food or the service"}
{"text":"All five of us loved this place.  The chips are homemade, very fresh mix of wheat and corn chips.  Salsa was good, not spicy but not bland.  All the food was delicious.  The decor was a blend of southwest and tongue in cheek.   Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great chips and salsa.  Can't say enough about the margarita's.  We had the Friday special - steak fundido's which were awsome."}
{"text":"I use to like this place (what was I thinking) but it has gone completely down hill. The service is absolutely atrocious FYI, even if it's completely dead. I asked for a something as simple as guacamole for a starter with no tomatoes. The waiter said the guacamole already had tomatoes in it. What?!! You mean to tell me your not making it fresh in the back? He replied that they made it earlier that morning (it was 4:30pm) and that it was in the fridge. Umm, gross! As a Mexican restaurant how lazy are you to not make your easiest staple, guacamole?! Food comes out literally 4 minutes after your ordering, no matter what it is, and on a scalding hot plate. Which means it's all microwaved. Grotesque! This place has lost my service."}
{"text":"Something has changed for the better....

Up until a few weeks ago I was still feeling three stars about Jalapeno Inferno.  We've been here or picked up take out on and off since my last review and it was always ok.  Last month we decided to go one night for dinner - they do have a nice atmosphere and good service. We ordered the skillet cheese (no chorizo this time), appetizer sampler platter and the tamales...everything I tried was really delicious.  The tamales are out of this world and the skillet cheese was nice and spicy.  

Since that night, I've been back a few times including two lunches and it has been equally good.  I don't know what's changed but Jalapeno Inferno has moved ahead of a couple of my regular Mexican restaurant go-to spots."}
{"text":"The food was good. The plate was extremely hot. But the food was lukewarm at best! Service was good. I would maybe give it a second try but not for sure.  Oh, and it was hot in there. They could turn the air conditioner on!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years.  Today I brought friends from Scotland and had been bragging on this place and was a bit disappointed.   It was a warm day in Scottsdale and we came in thirsty and warm.  No air condition was on and it was quite warm and somewhat uncomfortable.  We decided to stay anyway.  The service was very so-so.  It took awhile to get our cocktails as well as placing our orders.  In my opinion the restaurant was not busy.  I have seen it much busier on prior visits.   The lunch menu ha changed and I was sad to see Chile relleno  had been taken off.  I do not know if we will return?"}
{"text":"Nothing goes better with Mexican food than margaritas. And luckily at Jalapeno's they have a trio sampler so you get choose and enjoy three drinks for $10! 
Both my girlfriend and I love seafood food, so it worked out that I got the lobster tacos (sweet lobster meat with cilantro, onion and cheese) which came with a big serving of rice and beans and my gf got the tequila lime shrimp tacos so we could trade off.

Both meals came out quickly, and the plates were massive! We gorged on the delish tacos which went great with our margaritas! 

Our waitress was great, and she joked how they had a wheelbarrow out back to carry us out. Not gonna lie, I almost took her up on the offer - we were stuffed!  

This place is awesome, I can't wait to come back here when I'm in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"Came for dinner, Karlie was our waitress, along with our favorite waitress Samantha. Amazing service! A little misunderstanding when we order, we did not clarify and were charge a lil extra. Without hesitation the manager Melody came over in a very classy stay le and assured us she'd correct what really should of been our error for not asking. Amazing service!!! The food as always outstanding!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!! Lunch fajitas, half shrimp and steak veggies well done. Love it! I do each business lunch I can here. And then come myself again for dinner. The owners, Terry and his sister are the best people ever. I always see them there Helping out and creating smiles.

{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner, and overall mixed but positive results.

The good:  Corn & Flour chips plus salsa were terrific - crisp, warm, and great salsa.
Courtney's Burrito - laced with Inferno sauce that is actually spicy!  Generally what they advertise as hot/spicy is pretty mild, but this definitely packed a kick. Not overpowering, but genuinely hot.
Honey Flan - light, creamy, maybe a bit too much whipped topping, but not overly sugary or chemical tasting.

The not as good: My wife's fundido.  I forget which it was she ordered, but it was basically a chimichanga with a creamy jalapeno sauce on top.  It wasn't bad, the chimi was crispy, it was just pretty bland.  It could use something else in there to provide a contrast to the cream, something tangy to cut through it.

Cost of the two entrees and dessert was close to $40, no drinks.

Close to full on a Saturday around 5:30, probably busier as the night goes on."}
{"text":"My 10 yr old son got burned on the UNCOVERED handle of  cast iron skillet they serve their sizzling fajitas in. Spent the meal holding ice on his hand. When i called the owner over to tell him what had happened and that they should cover their handles, especially when placing in front of a child, he was not very sympathetic but did offer burn spray. Server comes out and asks if she should pack up our food to take home since my son was screaming in agony. I asked for ice and held it on his hand, while my food sat cold. My 2 other kids and husband had already started eating, so we decided to stay. Towards the end, the owner sends his manager out to apologize on his behalf and said, owner wants to treat us for dessert and take the fajitas off our bill. We did not accept their token dessert. Walked away with my sons hand being blistered and a $65 bill. When I complained about the uncovered handle to manager, he tells me that never happened before but owner will look into covering handles in future. The owner did not once check to see how son was doing and was quite aloof. Shame on you jalepenos,  for not being more cautious around a table filled with kids. The service to start was poor. Couldn't even clear a table before bringing out next course."}
{"text":"Husband and I had lunch on the patio. It was a beautiful day outside and we had a very nice server. I was considering ordering a dozen of their green corn tamales for my holiday dinner but wanted to try them first. I had not had tamales since I was a child and remembered them being served in corn husks. I ordered the tamales as an appetizer and my husband ordered carne asada fajitas to share. It took a little time for the food to come . When it did the server warned us that the plates were scalding hot. I had read on Yelp that the plates were hot but the food was not. So I touched my tamale with my finger and sure enough it was room temperature. I mentioned it to the server and she apologized and whisked it away. In the meantime my husband's fajitas were dried out and flavorless. The steak had been grilled but was absolutely tasteless with no seasoning. The green peppers and onions had been over cooked almost to a pulp. The guacamole was delicious. The tortillas were gummy and the homemade chips were doughy and a bit greasy.

The server returned with my tamales in less than 5 minutes and they were piping hot. They had obviously been microwaved. To my disappointment they were not wrapped in corn husks and steamed as I remembered tamales. They were like little cakes with a very small amount of green chili and corn stuffing. Very sweet and tasted more like a dessert than an appetizer. 

Overall a bad dining experience. The only nice things were the patio and the server. The food sucked!"}
{"text":"Best guacamole every had at a restaurant and the fish tacos are amazing"}
{"text":"Took my family to dinner last night and everything was very, very good. I had the Special Red White and Blue Margarita and it was great too. The Hatch Chilis are nice, the 2 kinds of chips are great and you can ask for the Spicy Salsa too! I used my new Free Shopping / Restaurant App called VEEBOW and got $5.00 Off!!  It's always busy here which says a lot!"}
{"text":"I recently ate at the jalapeño inferno for the first time and wow what a delight! The fajitas are fantastic and our server Ali was excellent!! She really made our experience awesome and was very attentive and helpful! I will definitely be back for more blood orange margaritas and great food!"}
{"text":"I ate at JI last night for the first time, at the DC ranch location, although this location doesn't appear on Yelp or Google Maps.

Overall it was ok. Our server and her trainee were pleasant, but overall service was slow. It took over 5 minutes for my husband to get his margarita, while we watched our server and the trainee talk with the bartender and another staff member while the bartender made the drink. This restaurant seems to have an abundance of staff, which makes the wait times worse. 

As far as the food, they forgot some of the sauces, the server noticed and corrected it. The table ordered steak fajitas, shrimp tacos, and Chile relleno with pork.  Overall not the best Mexican I've had in the valley. Most of the dishes we tried were not super flavorful. We also had the cookie dessert, which was good."}
{"text":"I just saw the news with restaurant ratings. I was surprised to learn that Jalapeno's had 5 restaurant violations."}
{"text":"The restaurant was close to the golf course we played at so my wife and I stopped for lunch on 10/8/17 around 2:00pm. The server we had was excellent and I in no way fault him. However, I ordered the grande shredded beef burrito for 14.00 and there nothing grands about it. It was normal size and had nothing but heavily salted shredded beef inside and that was all. To salty to even keep eating. My wife ordered the lunch beef fajitas and enjoyed those which was good. The \"top shelf\" margarita for 10.00 dollars was anything but top shelf. It uses a 12.95 cent tequila and they advertise lemon and lime juice. We received a bottom shelf shit of tequila, sweet and sour on ice, with a taste leaving my wife wanting to gag her last sip. We didn't want to get our server bad remarks because he was fun, chipper, and fun to be around. Just the food and the bartender were at fault on this afternoon."}
{"text":"Good food but overpriced because your in north Scottsdale. The fajitas were great. I also like the mini chimis."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was quick and piping hot. Been here 30 min and we are full and happy. We ordered the grilled quesadilla as an app then the chimi that ate nogales and the Anaheim chille relleno platter and were amazed! Even just the chips and salsa were excellent. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so close to home I thought I'd give it another chance. Had not been there in years. Now I remember why. The service was surly. My husband said something to the manager and now we both have stomach cramps. I wonder if he did something to our food? The pina colada was watered down and tasted bitter. The fish tacos were OK, but the roasted corn that came with it was odd. I don't think I'll be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"I had a nice lunch sitting out on the extended patio of Jalapeno's this week.  The sun was shining and it felt warm, the perfect excuse to order a margarita.  The drink was just so-so.  Nothing special.  

The lunch specials are very nicely priced at around $7 for two items.  The plate came hot and the shredded beef taco with the hard shell was quite nice.  The other dish was not memorable....in fact, I cannot even remember what I ordered right now!  

The waitress was nice; I think she has worked here for a long time.  I'll go back and this time I'll start with a beer and then maybe this place will move up to a 4-star rating!"}
{"text":"Went into Jalapenos earlier for the amazing Hatch menu that just came out. Our server Nicole was absolutely amazing. Very friendly and very attentive. Sydney was behind the bar making some amazing margaritas to sip on while we waiting for our delicious food. An amazing neighborhood spot to stop in for great margaritas and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Very slow service and there was not many people in the servers section. Food was excellent and appropriate for price. Half price margarita was awesome and they do not skimp on the alcohol. It would have been more enjoyable if the server said more than 2 words to me, and if the service wasn't so slow."}
{"text":"Standard Mexican chain-food cuisine. Tasted fine, poor service"}
{"text":"Best margaritas in town!  Happy Hour is great value with half price appetizers! 
Our waitress, Taylor, was very attentive and she has a great sense of humour and wit.  Relax in the early evening at Jalapeño's!"}
{"text":"Nice remodel but something happened to the service.... Forgot my lunch , husbands lunch cold and never asked for refills of chips, salsa or drinks! What's up guys??? Hopefully it's not starting a trend for this restaurant"}
{"text":"Food is always good but prices keep going up.  Not good enough for the prices they are asking.Nice patio."}
{"text":"Very impressive! Loved their service and style. The chips and salsa had an interesting flair to it. The chips were a mixture of tortilla and wonton type chips. The salsa had a peppery flavor which was really cool. I ordered the skillet chicken which was very yummy. My hubby got the street tacos which he really enjoyed as well. He ordered a margarita and I went with the berry bubbly martini which were both delicious and very strong which is a plus. The bill was right at about $50 bucks with tip which isn't too bad considering we drank alcohol. 

We also had a living social deal that expired almost a month prior and they still honored it. We will definitely be back and we'd also love to try their other restaurant, Rhythm and Wine!"}
{"text":"Lunch was good. We shared the steak fajitas. Chips were really good all you can possibly eat. Our drinks were always full and good service. Quick."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  Service was average at best.  Food was ok but not great.  Drinks were good but not great.  Went on a Thursday night and was greeted by a sign telling us that service was only available in the bar area.  Strange, are they remodeling or trying to close early?  Either way not a good first impression.  We won't be back, I'd rather go to Spotted Donkey, Haciendas, or El Encanto over this place any day of the week."}
{"text":"Excellent Margaritas!!! Stopped by on a Friday night and was pleased with the fast service in spite of the crowds. Will def be back!"}
{"text":"I hate to be the Bad Guy. But, I have to tell it like it is.
We were out in North Scottsdale and turned to Yelp for some Ideas for Mexican Food.
Seeing 3 people that I know had visited this place and given them great reviews, we thought we would give it a try.
Located in the middle of a shopping center, it looked nice,with a big outdoor patio. We went inside and were greeted by a male host who said we could help ourselves  to any table we liked on the Patio.
I went to use the restroom to wash my hands before we ate. The ladies was nice and clean and very nicely decorated, I noticed some interesting art work on the walls on the way back to my table. This is where the good times end.

Our Waitress ( I think it was Cyvannah) or something close to that, came right away and asked if we were ready to order. We said no,it was our first time there. We had not read the menu, but we ordered an Ice Tea and hot coffee. We got chips and salsa and our drinks. My coffee was old ,the bottom of the pot. It tasted it and there were grounds all in the bottom of the cup. My water glass had a big lip print on it. (NOT MY COLOR). So I never touched that. The Coffee mug was filthy as well. You can see from the photo I took of both of them. Because, later I asked if I could have a 2nd cup of coffee and our server said she would have to make another pot. Since that was the last of it she had given me. Well, there you go, I knew it.
Yes, I would love another cup,thank you. I was thinking ,this will be great I will get a real cup of coffee this time. Almost 20 min later she brought it. The cup was just as dirty. Does this place not have a dish washer(machine) because, nothing seemed cleaned.

Our food came no later than 5 min.after we ordered it. It took longer to get our to go boxes than the food that was to go in it. When she brought it ,she said,\"Careful it is really hot\". Well the dishes were hot not the food on them. 
Meaning they had all been microwaved.
I ordered Chicken Soup. It was supposed to be spicy. when she put it down in front of me there were multi colored bubbles all over the top of it. I said, \"wait, what are all these bubbles\"? She said that happened while she was walking with it , it made Bubbles. Plus it is hot, that is the Bubbles.
I took and spoon and scraped the bubbles off. They were soap bubbles.
I did taste the soup, it was barley warm, and was not spicy. So either there was soap in the soup or the bowl when the soup was placed in it.

My Dining Partner ordered and enchilada with rice and beans. The rice was old and dried out as you will see in the photo as well. We also ordered a sampler platter so we could try a little of every thing. Which everything on that as well seemed as if it was made before and reheated in a microwave.
Nothing was good and nothing was hot. even the Cheese Crisp all the tortilla broke apart like it was days old. Fresh tortillas do not do that.

The chips and salsa are good , but if you are gluten intolerant, don't eat the Flour chips, they are mixed in with corn ones. Our waitress never came back to check on us till the end. I had wanted Corn tortillas with my meal. I had been given flour. She brought those along with our check. Knowing that we were done with the meal. Looking back that day. I wish we would of asked to speak to the Manager. Maybe he or she was not there that day. Maybe that is why everything was so bad. We paid $50.00 for this mess including tip.
Our waitress seemed very pre occupied with something else , somewhere else. There was another girl working the patio with long dark red hair. She was very on top of her tables and taking really good care of her people. So it was just us that had Cyvanaah on the patio.

Anyway, it was a horrible experience and one that we paid a lot for as well. Check out the photos , I think you will be horrified. We both felt sick that night. I know it was from the food and I only ate a little.
I am guessing that most people like it here for the Drinking ,the Happy hour. Because, I do not know how they could stay in business with dirty dishes and bad food."}
{"text":"My team at work has a monthly lunch out where we can all pal around, and most recently Jalapeño Inferno was selected as our destination.

Looking through all the reviews on Yelp I was certainly excited, but I was also apprehensive about the North Scottsdale address. I thought maybe it would be too schmancy for my liking, but I couldn't have been more wrong.

To start with, the mandatory chips and salsa: SO GREAT! There are corn tortilla chips mixed in with fried triangles of flour tortilla, giving you crunchy then flaky texture battles and a difference of flavor in every bite. More restaurants should do this! My party of 6 put away 4 baskets! The mild salsa was homemade I think, and chunky, and the hot salsa was also good with just a slight amount of heat.

The menu was so varied that I had a hard time choosing what to get. Everyone at the table got something different, but since it was my first time here I decided to see about a basic staple: the lunch combo. I ordered a chile relleno (a true measure of any Mexican restaurant) and a chicken enchilada, with rice and beans. The relleno was really good, tasted fresh (not frozen) and spicy. The cheese inside was melted through and each bite was delicious. The accompanying chicken enchilada was also superb, with the chicken being throughly seasoned, and not drowned in sauce to where you lose flavor. You could taste the cheese, chicken, sauce, and the corn tortilla in every mouthful. The beans and rice were as you'd expect, but I'd say a bit above the standard. I also got to try a generous piece of a co-worker's Mexican pizza, and the best word to describe it is decadent, as in I knew there was no way that it was good for me, but I couldn't stop eating it anyway.  All in all a great lunch!

If Jalapeno Inferno can nail the basics so well, I can't wait to try some of their signature specialty items. I'll definitely be back soon, probably on a TACO TUESDAY."}
{"text":"Holy moley love this place! Favorite is green corn tamale ... Yum! Owners R very accomidating  five stars for sure"}
{"text":"We usually have gone to Jalapeno Inferno for lunch on Saturdays and one night a few weeks ago decided to go back and try it for dinner.  

I asked for my Margarita like I always do there - Top Shelf on the rocks and - strained.  I don't like the pulp in their home made margarita mix.  I got the first one with all this icky pulp and just asked to have it sent back and just to strain it.  The owner came back and was so rude to my -- in front of our 2 kids no less - saying that he gave us the regular margarita since we didn't appreciate the fact that their mix is homemade.  I told him they strained it for me all the time on Saturdays - bless Patrick's heart.  The owner then told me he did not know how that was done.  I said \"Well there's a little thing most bars have called a \"STRAINER\".  He said he didn't have one.  What???

So forget the better tequila and the Gran Marnier that would normally be in my Top Shelf margarita.  I'm just some low life that didn't deserve that I guess.  

So I find out -- this guy is the OWNER that treated us this way.  We have been there every Saturday at lunch with the 4 of us spending easily $100 a week -- through the slow summer when no one was there and everything.  Yes, good tamales and food in general.  But I'd rather eat in a barn than pay for rude service and line that owners pockets with my money.  We've never been back..."}
{"text":"Amazing experience the food is amazing. I had the carne asada burrito and it is out of this world. Karlie and Samantha are wonderful and provide the best service you could ask for!"}
{"text":"So good! A friend and I were trying to decide on where to go for dinner and this place showed up on yelp. When I mentioned the name, she started raving about how good it was, so I had to try for myself. Definitely didn't disappoint! We had chips with salsa & guacamole, chicken and steak fajitas, beef enchiladas and even tried the flan, which I've never had before. Not a big fan of the flour tortilla chips but the server was happy to swap them out for corn when we asked. A little pricey ($80+ for 3 ppl) but we did order a lot and the portions were huge. We'll have plenty of leftovers for the next day or so! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I'm SUPER disappointed in our last visit to Jalepeno Inferno this past weekend. I touted it so highly to my husband and family after a couple of great experiences.  I went to dinner with my husband, son, sister in law, brother in law, and their two kids. Thankfully the kids and my brother in law were all fine but me, my husband, and my sister in law all ended up sick over night. We compared our meals and the common denominator was the coleslaw side we all ate. When I called the next day to report our sickness the person on the phone tried telling me that food poisoning only occurs 24 hours after eating the bad food. I'm not a doctor, but it seemed pretty clear that the three of us all ate the same side (coleslaw) and overnight all had the same reaction.  The person on the other line then proceeded to say that maybe we're \"just not used to eating Mexican food\"...I assure you, we eat Mexican food pretty often both at home and out and this has never happened before. She then asked for my name and number so that she could call me back after she spoke with her chef. It's been over 24 hours after my call to the restaurant and I've still heard nothing back although I'm not holding my breath. Needless to say I won't be going back anytime soon, not just due to the fact that we got sick but because of the lack of care taken once they were alerted to the fact that there was an issue."}
{"text":"So. Confused. About. The. Rave. Reviews. Wandered in early Saturday evening for the first time. Smelled like a BATHROOM. Didn't try the signature green tamales so maybe those are secretly awesome. The salsa is just run of the mill. Tastes like supermarket salsa. Yeah there's a mix of chips (flour and corn) ... big whoop. The flour chips are way too oily and the corn chips also just taste like out of the bag chips from the grocery store. I ordered the Shrimp Anejo entree and my husband ordered shrimp tacos. Shrimp was seasoned well but salty. They also did not clean the shrimp - GROSS!!!They were sautéed in olive oil, but the veggies were sautéed in butter... makes sense (not). Onto the beans ... again tastes like out of the can. And my entree came with some weird corn cheese spicy thing which was not specified on the menu - it had just said corn. The best thing was a margarita we got with their signature #Batch91 tequila. Very delicious. But overwhelmed by all the other factors - topped off by the 3-4 FLIES that kept bothering us while eating. Won't be returning to this place."}
{"text":"I hosted a birthday party for my 80 year old mom today and we had 45 people.  It is hard to find a place that will host a group of this size and be personable.  The manager(Becky) and the staff were truly incredible.  The environment food and service was exceptional.  I go there with friends often for lunch and this evening was so awesome for me,  my family and guests.  Oh and the food is awesome!!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! The green corn tamale appetizer is the best thing ever.  Fantastic service and food is so fresh. They have lunch size fajitas that are perfect! I brought my sister here who's from Chicago and was looking for good Mexican food. She loved it as well. I almost forget it's there because it's north up scottsdale road but it is well worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Prices are pretty high for the quality of the food. Chips and Salsa were both good. We ordered the appetizer platter - most of it was really tasty. However the Chimichurri Steak Tacos were dry like the desert (even the chimichurri itself was dry). Took 10 minutes to get our drinks and the manager had to take our order as no one has come to us after 10 minutes. We weren't offered anything complimentary for our wait. Considering how expensive it was, and the poor quality of service and some of the food, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Met a friend there for lunch. I'll give it another chance later but my first experience was...meh. Ordered a bowl of the corn chowder for my meal and it had good flavor, but was room temperature at best. Good thing we were sitting outside so \"room temperature\" wasn't in the air conditioning. 

Service was good but friend's burrito was also considered \"okay\" but not something they would drive to as a new destination.

I hope it improves."}
{"text":"We went to Jalapeño Inferno for the first time last night.  We ordered the Fajitas for two, $30.00.

We were disappointed. The shrimp (five served) were luke warm at best.  The chicken breast tasted like it had been cooked prior and then just heated up for our plate.  The chicken was tough.

There was ONE red green pepper slice on the entire platter which was about four inches long and 1/3 inch thick.  No green pepper at all.

The onions the chicken was served oner on the skillet were soggy.

The menu advertises the fajitas being served on a \"sizzling platter\".  There was defiantly NO sizzle on our platter.  And the cast iron platter being really hot is what caramelizes the onions giving the fajitas their wonderful flavor.  Not so for us.

Tortillas and salsa were served to us but no napkins.  We had to ask for napkins and silverware.

The tortillas are a combination of pita chips and tortillas.  I don't know about you, but I don't dip pita chips in salsa so we dug through the basket to find the traditional tortilla chips.

The salsa bowl we were served had big chunks of onion in it.  Much bigger than you would want to dip into.

The restaurant was VERY loud.  We could not really hear each other talk even with being seated in a corner.

The fajitas are served with sour cream, guac, rice and refried beans.  The refried beans tasted like they were out of a can.  The rice did nothing for the fajitas, hardly any taste at all.  A small cup of cheese was served with the fajitas but there was so little cheese in it, the amount was really appropriate for about one and one-half fajitas.

Bottom Line:  Perhaps the other dishes are good, but we would not return to find out."}
{"text":"Great food!!
I had the Courtney's Burrito and it was awesome and pretty spicy.
They have 2 kinds of complementary tortilla chips, salsa was ok.

Highly recommend if you like your food spicy."}
{"text":"Can't beat the chips and salsa, ceviche, tacos de la calle and margaritas!"}
{"text":"They have awesome tortilla chips, delicious salsa, and great menu items to choose from. Love their salads, always fresh! Drinks are good as well. Great environment, and wonderful service."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my Sunday lunch at Jalapenos! Everything from the patio to the service was above average! I really liked the food especially the flour tortilla chips and salsa. I had a yummy chicken chimi. I will go back in the future."}
{"text":"Awesome! Sat in the new bar and was very pleased. Great place to watch sports and hang out with friends. The new bar is much bigger and there are a lot more TVs. Ordered the New Mexico enchiladas and they were delicious. I'll definitely be back for happy hour."}
{"text":"Tuesday's are the day to go for me...all you can eat tacos plus rice and beans for $9.99 how do you go wrong!?! And the fresh made margaritas are really good to and they're half price. You barely can eat at Taco Bell for that price, and who wants to anyway. Lol"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I drove up here on a lovely spring afternoon for lunch on their patio that was open onto the bar area.  They had several flat screen t.v.s which offered viewing of the March Madness games.

We started with chips and salsa (I was not a fan of the flour chips mixed in, boyfriend liked them).  He also ordered a side of the Inferno sauce, which the waitress explained to us as not starting out too spicy, but watch out, because the heat builds!  The boyfriend actually had to stop eating the salsa when our food came because his mouth was on fire and he wanted to be able to taste his food. 

We were able to take advantage of the Yelp special (buy one get one free lunch).  I built my own chimichanga and he built his own burrito.  Both were delicious.  I also got the honey flan for dessert.  It was also delicious, but very rich, and I couldn't finish it!

We will definitely come back here to taste many of the other things off of the menu.  The service and ambience were great and the salsa was hot!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The chips, espinaca con queso, and valley verde/spinach enchiladas are delicious! This is definitely one of our family outings almost once a week due to the cravings we have for the food! The staff is really friendly as well and we always enjoy their services :)"}
{"text":"Food is inedible... Place is filthy... The owner has a horrible attitude- he told me the chicken is pre cooked and made warm to order... Place is a joke..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant! We vacation every March in Scottsdale and I look forward to this meal all year long.  Courtney's burrito with steak is my go to! HOT and flavorful. There Inferno sauce is outstanding. So many restaurants sacrifice flavor in an attempt to make things hot but Jalepeno's incorporate both heat and flavor perfectly.  Flour tortilla chips and guac are also great and they have the coldest draught beer around.  If all that wasn't enough we've always had very attentive and friendly wait staff.  I can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed! I love this place but I decided to make the reservation thru Open Table. I made the restaurant aware that it was my wife's birthday when I made the reservation. They never acknowledged that it was her birthday, never wished her Happy Birthday. What a joke. Jalapeno Inferno, get with the program...."}
{"text":"Love a free sweet corn tamale! It was sooo good. And so were the housemade flour chips! I wish they were the only representation I had of Jalapeno Inferno because this review would look much different.

However ... and this is big ... the $75.00 on 2 margarita pitchers was totally a RIP OFF.... are you kidding me? Not cool, Bistro Mexicano, not cool.

They offered pitchers for the group - and we're like \"WOW, that's great.\" And then they charged us for 8 individual overpriced margaritas that they dumped into glorified glass mugs... I guess \"bistro\" is like code for snotty bartender, overpriced drinks, slow service, and \"B\" at best mexican food.

I'd go here again, but I'd definitely have to pre-game the Margaritas beforehand... otherwise the first 30 minutes of the night will be signing an \"official document\" verifying we're of legal age. And then top it off by throwing down a Benjamin for two measly margarita pitchers...

I wanted to love it. And I just really didn't - not at all."}
{"text":"Consistently disappointing summarizes our experiences here.  The chips and salsa (ask for hot salsa) and inferno sauce are the only positive factors at this restaurant.  My husband and I have ordered food here numerous times and each time leave shaking our heads wondering why we didn't learn from our past experiences at Inferno.

I'll summarize our most recent visit to provide an example.  I ordered a combination plate that was supposed to consist of a soft vegetarian taco and bean tostada with a side of rice and beans.  My husband also ordered a combination plate with a bean tostada and inquired as to what options were available for a burrito without meat.  The server pointed him to \"Courtney's Favorite Burrito Inferno\" that was on the menu and explained that the burrito had rice, black beans, cilantro, onions, etc. in it and that he could get \"pretty much anything he wanted\" in it and they would just omit the meat. When our meals arrived, my plate was missing the side of beans altogether and the taco was served with a hard shell.  When I asked to have the taco replaced with the soft shell that I ordered, my plate was swept away and reappeared about a minute later with a soft taco that was clearly simply the contents of the hard shell taco that had been scraped haphazardly into a tortilla.  As it turned out, the taco was actually the best part of the meal as it was nearly impossible to chew the greasy, leathery tostada shell that was sopped with refried beans and few if any other toppings.  My husband's plate contained the same lackluster tostada and had the appropriate sides of rice and beans.  As for the burrito, which according to the combination menu is supposed to be ten inches, what arrived was a six inch dried, cracked, and stale tortilla containing nothing but greasy sauteed onions and green peppers that I would assume are used for the fajitas.  The burrito was so flavorless and the ingredients so poor quality that he gave up on even trying to consume the majority of it.

Another consistent negative that we've observed about Inferno is the generally rude attitude of the bartenders who seem to be put out to have to make a margarita.  Once we do manage to get their attention after they continually walk past and ignore customers in need of drinks at the bar, a margarita is then sloppily thrown together and served in a glass that is only about 2/3 full.  It would appear that the staff's attitude is simply an extension of the owner's as we've seen Terry, who certainly recognizes us from Inferno and from his sister property Rhythm & Wine yet will not even greet us or most of the other customers, skulking around the restaurant rudely demanding that staff change the television channels as he stands around idly, seemingly wishing he were anywhere but at his restaurant.

All in all, this is a place to stop for some chips and salsa and nothing more.  The location is really the only reason that we've been to Inferno as often as we have and we certainly aren't in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"Great food and service and awesome chips and salsa! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Came here for a rehearsal dinner. Chips and salsa were beyond amazing and fresh to order. Free guac if you check in. We did Buffett style entree. The pulled chicken was delicious ! The servers were highly attentive."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite, the tequila shrimp is my favorite. I usually have Taylor and she is awesome, great service and always a smile, but I had paige this time. She was super sweet and very helpful, made me try something called the boss. Very good and I hope I see her again. I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"This was the second time we've been to Jalapeno Inferno and I am certain it will be the last.  We decided to hit up this joint again after forgetting we've been there once and subsequently bought a localdines coupon thinking we would try the place out.  After purchasing the coupon we both realized we'd been there before and weren't impressed the first time, but since we already bought it, we headed down for some dinner.  

The restaurant was packed on this particular Sunday night, so we waited about 15 minutes to be seated.  We were seated in the bar area, which normally would be fine, but like I said it was pack and we were surrounded by people who were getting a drink waiting for their table.  It was so uncomfortably crowded I almost had a panic attack.  Thankfully a booth opened up near our hightop table and we quickly claimed it to get out of the crowd.  The staff was accommodating, but seemed super overwhelmed by the massive amount of people.

The chips/salsa that were served before our meal were ok.  The salsa wasn't my style and the flour chips were good, but the plain ones (not sure why they mix the two) were so-so.  I ordered steak fajitas, which came out looking like chicken (a weird color) and the Hubs had enchiladas, which he seemed to like.

Basically, my opinion is there are better mexican choices in town.  Jalapeno Inferno is OK, but I would rather go to GREAT than OK.  Just my two cents..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Everything between atmosphere, chips and salsa, main course, and most importantly, their Flan. Have to try."}
{"text":"I was a regular there and have been happy in the past. I had met my family there on Saturday the 9th for a light dinner and some drinks. Since it was early in the evening I had decided to invite my wife and 2 sons. My sons are 6 and 2. Since the family party was so large we had to set at 2 different tables. So my 2 year old son wanted to bounce between tables, wanting to see his mother and father. 

The manager/ soon to find out the owner was the one who rudely disrespected me and my family. He spoke very loud how he didn't enjoy my 2 year old going between tables. And he said that my 2 year son was an endangerment to his staff!! He spoke out loud making  the other customers very aware of his frustrations. 

I proceded to let him know that I was not happy and that I would never return to his establishment. His response was you have already told me that twice why are u telling me again.

Long story short, I will never return to the Jalapeño Inferno again. And being in the sales line of work I will spread the word to everyone to never eat there again.

Sincerely
Aaron Morrison"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place. I've made my grandparents take me here the last three years for my birthday, for dinner. 
Their margarita's are my favorite, I don't know how they make them but they come out in a more smoothie sort of way, than how frozen margs are more slushy like at most places I get them from, so you don't get that weird watery-ness once they melt a little.
Their food is amazing, I love their green corn tamales, that sh*t is to die for. I am going to miss this place so much when I move to Minneapolis, I'm hoping the Mexican food up there is as good as it is here.
The service is always lovely, the atmosphere is great, and they have the cutest little patio :)"}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was good. Needs a little attention in the decor department. Our booth had drywall exposed where the table has hit the wall several times and there has been a half measure to repair.

The flan is out of this world. Out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"We experienced the worst customer service I have had in years. We waited almost 25 minutes for water and had asked 4 people for Chips and Salsa. This restaurant used to be one of my favorites for a neighborhood Mexican restaurant but the managers need to step up their game. The manager apologized and said there was no reason for their errors. She offered to comp our drinks and when the bill came everything was still on the bill. Very disappointing experience. I asked the hostesses and other servers to have the manager stop by to speak with her but she never reappeared. I finally flagged down another server to at least have this error corrected."}
{"text":"AMAZING! We tried this restaurant because of a Groupon and will keep coming back because of the amazing food. The chili relleno was the best I have ever had and I lived in New Mexico for a year and never found one that came close to this place! Warm monterey jack cheese oozed from my chili with shrip and just a light batter. The fundido dish was very good as well. Just a kick of jalapeno and lots of cream cheese. 

The atmosphere was great. Service was fantastic. Several people checked on our table to make sure we were good. The complimentary chips and salsa were yummy, they don't just put regular chips, there were a different variety that were more like a crisp and they were yummy! 

They also gave us a card for $5 off our next visit which will be soon! This was probably the best mexican food I have had ever!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot after seeing it on my happy hour app. I signed up for the email newsletter on their website and received a 5$ coupon when you spend $20 or more on anything. 

Food wise, they had half off happy hour from 4:30-6:30 and domestic beers were 2.75 and imports 3.75. The chips were tasty and so was the salsa. The funditos were good but nothing you wouldn't find at any other mexican restaurant. 

Their website and social media work seems to be very good. I like places that keep me informed of what's going on.

The cantina was very nice inside and everything was tasty. 

Might go again someday and try some more dishes. Hey where was this \"free tamale\" everyone is talking about?"}
{"text":"Dante hated mediocrity and this place although not as firey as the name implies offers terrific recipies and a wonderful happy hour value in North Scottsdale. The staff is courteous and very friendly. 1/2 price happy hour items are delicious and plentiful. The cheap margaritas are full flavor and full of tequila. The happy hour in the cantina is kid friendly if you are looking for a reasonable place to fill the kids with chips and mini burritos. 

We had the sampler plate, shrimp cocktails and a basket of fresh corn and flour chips. With drinks for 3 we got out of there for around $30. Great value."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch with a friend. The ambiance was good. The restaurant was clean. The service was average if not a bit slow. The food was good/average. There is nothing about the place that makes it stand out good or bad. A nice neighborhood restaurant and retreat from the heat."}
{"text":"If you love Mexican food you have to try this place. Great food! Great service! The best margaritas... especially the Boss Margarita! If you're looking for a great summer beer they also have Orange Blossom on tap and it is excellent! I highly recommend Jalapeños to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Not sure if the cooks (there is no way they have a chef back there) know what Mexican food is.  I had their shrimp tacos and they were absolutely tasteless.  How can anyone mess up shrimp tacos??!?   The only good thing was my drink.  I will not return....anything is better than Jalapeno Inferno!"}
{"text":"Tasty! The chips and salsa should get 5 stars. The other food was pretty good too and service was great. Try the queso!"}
{"text":"We live close to jalapeño Inferno. I can't begin to describe how wonderful not only the food is, but as well as the service staff! We are always greeted pleasantly, and any request that we make our taking care of diligently. The manager always stops by to say hello to our kids, and makes for a wonderful, Pleasant family experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food, we are from San Diego, we have had some real good Mexican food, this place rates high in our book, when we go back we will  definitely eat there again, the staff here were very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Ordered shrimp cliche and sat at the bar.  Delicious.  Bartender was great and I love that its family owned!  Support small businesses in our area!  GO THERE!"}
{"text":"The menu is okay but the food is VERY SALTY. I'm not that sensitive to salt but this food was almost inedible. 

The service was very slow and I had to contantly flag down a waitress for more ice tea (remember, I was eating a salt mine!). When it came time to get the check, yep, you guessed it. I had to get up and look for the waitress to ask for my check. 

The atmosphere was casual and decent but the salty food and poor service will keep me from returning."}
{"text":"Their happy hour food deals are great.  Highly suggest the sampler platter, its enough for for 2.  Love the chips and salsa.  Excellent place all around."}
{"text":"I'm no sissy, but Jalapeño Inferno Bistro's Inferno salsa had me in tears!

JIBM is located in a strip mall in the middle of no wear in Scottsdale, Arizona. Since it was such a warm, beautiful night, my fiancé and I decided to eat dinner on their outdoor patio. Since we ate outside, I'm not too sure how big the inside of this place is or what it looks like. 

Right when we were seated we were given a big bowl of complementarity chips and salsa. The great thing about JIBM's chips is that they give you both corn and flour tortilla chips. I love flour tortilla chips and since not many Mexican joints offer them, I ended up going through at least three bowls. Their salsa was really chunky and loaded with veggies, which is the way I prefer my salsa. I also got a side of their famous inferno salsa. This salsa was dark green in color and looked really watered down but to my surprise that watered down green salsa tasted like it was made in the fiery pits of hell. One bite set my mouth a blaze. Sadly, this salsa was all heat and no flavor, so I didn't touch it for the rest of the evening, which kind of bummed me out because I love hot stuff.  

Since it was happy hour when we arrived, we decided to take advantage of their half off any appetizer special and order their South of the Border Platter, which usually cost $12.99 but we got it for 6.99. This is what this appetizer consisted of:
Cheese Quesadilla
Green Corn Tamale
Mini Red and Green Chile Burritos
Chicken Mini Chimichangas 
Espinaca Con Queso and Beans (Cheese Dip)

Besides the quesadilla, which was just OK, all of these items were really tasty, especially the tamale. This tamale is made with sweet white corn masa and filled with Mexican cheeses and green chiles. It was really, really good. In fact, their green corn tamale's have won the Best of Phoenix award for best tamale's.

For dinner I ordered their signature Fundido and my fiancé got their Verde Valley Spinach Enchiladas. My fundido was made with a huge flour tortilla that was filled with delicious marinated steak, grilled onions and peppers and then deep fried and covered with an amazing jalapeño cream cheese sauce. My Fundido was wonderful, especially the jalapeño cream cheese sauce, which had an amazing flavor. 
My girl's enchiladas were stuffed with spinach and a slightly spicy cream sauce and topped with red enchilada sauce, espinaca con queso sauce and toasted almonds. Oddly, I did not try her meal but she said it was really good. Their rice and beans were good too.
Besides the disappointing inferno salsa, my only other problem with this place is that all they have to drink is Pepsi products. They do not offer any aguas frescas like horchata or jamaica, which made me sad.  

The service here was great. Our waitress, although very busy, always made sure we had everything we needed. She was also extremely friendly and even had a great sense of humor. The prices here were also really good. 

If your ever find yourself driving down Scottsdale road and happen to pass by JIBM, do yourself a favor and stop your car and grab a bite to eat. This place is definitely worth checking out if your in the area."}
{"text":"I'm a little late with this review, but it is worth the read! 
I have been going to jalapeños for 15 years. The chips and salsa have always been superb, however, the margs have never been a reason to go there. Over the last few years my family and I have noticed the service and level of quality slowly decline. The last visit I made and will EVER make was the final straw. It was new years day with a one page menu and a way overpriced buffet. To make a long story short we were accused, by the owner, of our 4 year old eating food off the buffet without paying, even though it was free for kids under 5. When we were charged for him and the 10 grapes he \"stole\" she told us we were \"Wasting food\".  She continued to speak to us like we were 5 years old and made us feel like criminals. I will sorely miss my chips and salsa, but I will not miss paying too much for poor service and overpriced average food."}
{"text":"This Mexican restaurant is literally in my backyard so it is our go to place when we want a quick Mexican food fix! The salsa and chips are great and I like the fact they have flour chips as well as corn chips - I have had the shredded beef tacos, mini fundidos, beef enchilada and each time they do not disappoint. The take out service is awesome - you call, place your order and when it is ready they bring it to your car - so easy! The patio area is nice for when the weather is not too hot- you don't feel like you are sitting on a patio in a grocery store parking lot - it is very enjoyable. No 5th star only because the wait staff and hostesses are not that friendly - every time I have been n they act like they want to be anywhere but there"}
{"text":"Been here several times and have not been disappointed. Had the steak Fajitas. Very good. The frozen sangria is not to be missed. Also, happy hour has a good selection of appetizers and drinks. Service is consistently good."}
{"text":"Have gone here several times and always had a good experience however this time was a disaster. Cold soup sent back and still not hot the second time. One person in our party asked for mustard for his burger, did not have any which was weird because he also had eaten here before and they always had Mustard. French fries were ice cold and so they gave him another order half the size. My lobster tacos were great but my husband said his chicken tacos were fair. My friend had a fajita salad and almost choked on something hard which we figured was an onion skin. All in all it was not good. Oh and we had to wait 20 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"Very delicious Mexican food with a hint of American.There is a wide selection of food and drink. Chunky salsa and crispy tortilla chips are served as you decide what food to order. The service is usually very quick and it's almost always possible to get a table right away. Seating is offered inside the restaurant and outside on the patio, misters are available during summer and heaters are available during winter. 
My family regularly enjoys Jalapeño Inferno and I plan to go back for a long time."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. The steak salad is bomb. A must when coming to Scottsdale. Rachel the manager took great care of us on an order mix up. Which is the only time ever in many many visits. Love it. Happy customers!"}
{"text":"This was the first time patronizing Jalapeno Inferno Bistro tonight -- was I in for a real treat!  I was so very pleased not only with the food but with the service as well.  John is an absolutely great server - very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu.  My son and I had a most wonderful dining experience -- thank you!"}
{"text":"Since this had been one of my favorites,  of course we would return. Only this last visit a couple weeks ago was not so great. The chicken fajita did not have much for flavor and the soft flour shells were very heavily soaked/cooked in grease.  I could not eat them. Nothing special with the beans, rice etc. Just very mediocre. We left still hungry as the waitress even forgot our appetizer. I don't want to give up on them yet, as it used to be so good.  Hopefully it was just a bad day and hopefully they get rid of the greasy shells."}
{"text":"The only reason the review gets two stars is because my meal was good. The service was horrible, and the other two meals were subpar. It took us over ten minutes to be acknowledged at our table. Eventually a manager came to us and got drink orders but never apologized for the wait. There were many tables open, I understand busy nights but this did not appear to be the ordeal. Eventually a waitress got our order, one meal was over cooked and dry, the other came out cold and a side of cold fundido sauce that they said they microwaved."}
{"text":"I went here on a cold night around the holidays and it provided the warmth I needed. The front room is pretty hokey, and I'm not sure I'd like dining in there. But the back room, the \"lounge\" area, is much more my style. The food was above average Mexican, lacking the spiciness of other spots but more than making up with the quality ingredients. I also enjoyed the live entertainment (some acoustic dudes covered \"My Winding Wheel\" by Ryan Adams -- play that anywhere and I'll give three stars). I'd go back, but only for that back room. The front room looks like Don Pablo's had a lovechild with Ajo Al's. Blah."}
{"text":"I was surprised. I couldn't get into a nearby restaurant, it was Christmas Eve, crowded in other places so I came in with the family. The food was surprisingly good, our server was excellent everyone was great. Try the Inferno burrito - very very hot! Yum."}
{"text":"We were out of state with family looking for great food and drink.   This place was a hit!   From the great chips and salsa (which we couldn't stop eating) to the margaritas (husband and my cousin said they were strong and tasty) to the main meals (chili rellanos have now set the bar for others to reach) and kudos to our server answering questions knowledgeably for our vegetarian diner.  It was the best dining experience of our trip - we would be there every week if we lived there!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and tried the chimichanga, street tacos, and the pollo fun dido. The chimi and tacos are just ok. A little flat in flavor. The fun dido is real tasty with a good kick and a lot of cheese. Their complimentary chips n salsa are delicious and they give you a variety with flour and corn chips!  The margarita is very good but a little light In the tequila zone. I'd like to give them a 4 star if it wasn't for the rather inflated prices, but I suppose they're in the right area for it in n. Scottsdale. I will be back but will most likely get a beer instead of the cocktail."}
{"text":"Hubby and I love this place. Food and service are always good. Looking forward to trying their new location in DC Ranch. I think it opens Fall 2014."}
{"text":"This is a great Mexican Restaurant. The flour nachos and salsa is excellent, they have great signature dishes, and the service and atmosphere is very good. Prices are a touch on the high side, but the food is genuinely good so I don't mind paying for quality."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are delicious, great flour chips. The atmosphere is really nice perfect for date night or families. Margaritas are really good especially the boss! Food has always been delicious, never had something I didn't like, but the naked poblano appetizer comes with a sliver of a poblano pepper and there's way more toppings then there is poblano. NOT a \"stuffed poblano\" more like a slice of pepper under a dip. Still tastes amazing though."}
{"text":"Salt,salt and more salt! If you love salt and don't care about your blood pressure order the green sauce on your burrito or chimichanga and the salty shredded beef! The green sauce is SO salty it is literally inedible!  I ordered a chimichanga and asked for it with both red and green sauce.  The first time they brought it to me, they under fried it, which is the worst!  I got a greasy, soggy mess on my plate.  I sent it back.  The waiter came back and said it was MY fault because I asked for sauce on it!  Clearly, they were really busy at 7:00 pm on a Saturday night, and just didn't fry it long enough.  It happens!  I am a seasoned chimichanga consumer and I know what the deal was here, don't blame the customer when the cooks are rushing and compromising quality just to get orders out.  So the waiter said the only solution was to re-do my order with the sauce on the side.  Attached is my picture of my dad, DRY chimichanga.  I was so hungry by the time they brought it out, I just went with it.  I bit into it and the shredded beef was so salty, it was inedible.  I cut off a bit of the tortilla and dipped it in the green sauce and it was all salt!  Again, I informed the waiter, who now just discounted me as a nuisance.  I have been a patron of this place since BEFORE the fire!  I expected more.  Taste the food before you serve it and cut down on the sodium!  I give it three stars because the problems here are so rookie, shouldn't even happen!  The salsa, which also used to be super, was tasteless.  What happened to the cilantro?  I learned to love cilantro because of your salsa!  Left hungry!  Who leaves a Mexican restaurant hungry?  Sorry guys,  up train your staff and taste what you are serving before it goes on someone's plate!"}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, horrible.  I have no idea why this place gets the customers it does. CUBED chicken. Absolutely disgusting. Xtapa Joes is the bomb and its two blocks away. I will never eat at jalapeño inferno again."}
{"text":"Awwful.  The only saving grace were the flour chips.  The chimis were bland and 90% dark meat and flavorless.  I ordered a chile relleno with chicken.  Well they piled a chuck of shredded chicken on the top that looked like someone had thrown up.  Beans tasteless, rice? red and tasteless.  The tea was great.  Our waiter was excellent"}
{"text":"As far as Mexican restaurants go, this is one of my favorites.  We never come to Scottsdale without going to Jalapeno.  I have been coming here for longer than I can remember, and now my lady is as addicted as I.

I consider myself a margarita aficionado, and they have among the best margaritas that I have experienced. The beauty of their margarita menu is that there is something for everyone.  If you want an awesome margarita in the style that most gringos enjoy, order their ultimate margarita.  They make their own sweet and sour, and it is delicious and large.  If you don't care for a sweet margarita, order The Boss.  It is a more traditional margarita made with only a splash of sweet and sour, but mostly just tequila and lime juice.  Enjoy their home fried tortilla chips while you drink your first margarita.  They use both flour and corn tortillas to make these.  I usually eat all of the flour chips first, but never leave a corn chip behind either.

To go with your next margarita just pick about anything off of the menu and you will not be sorry.  I most recently ordered the Texas flat enchiladas. The taste was good, but I found the thick masa tortillas held a little too much of the oil in which they were fried and were a bit too rich for my taste.  My sister's mushroom and goat cheese enchiladas were yummy and different.  My lady's fish tacos were delicious. If you don't want to experiment with something new, order anything more conventional, and you won't be sorry.

Other than to visit family and friends, Jalapenos is the reason that I can't wait to return to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I felt like a queen!  My husband wanted to go here to experience their \"Taco Tuesday\" weekly special. You order a taco dinner plate and then you get unlimited taco refills. It was our first time here, so as a celiac person that makes me nervous.

Carl, the manager, was greeting people at the door and it was nice to have a small chat about the restaurant before we even went inside.

We sat on the patio and proceeded to stare at the menu. Everyone who works there is super friendly and attentive! However, it was Samantha who left a lasting impression on me. We were handed chips and salsa, which is a staple for Mexican places.  Dan and I were discussing whether we thought they were flour or corn (our typical Celiac chat) and Samantha came over. She was not our server, but handling the area nearby. She proceeded to inform us to not eat the flour chips nor the corn as they are fried in the same oil as flour items. I was so grateful for her information! She then asked what I would like to eat and then educated me on how best to order it from our server. I absolutely appreciated Samantha and her information. She even consulted with our server to make sure she would have the kitchen prepare my food the right way. The food was flavorful and prepared perfectly and the margaritas were fresh and cold! 

It was so great to have such a passionate advocate, like Samantha, at this restaurant! I will never forget how much she cared for my situation. It made me feel so nice that I didn't have to be \"that girl\" with all the restrictions. Thank you for employing someone like her, Carl! She is worth her weight in...well....margaritas!"}
{"text":"Food superb and way too much to eat for lunch! Service by KIRSTIE was even better than superb friendly, attentive and super quick with refills and the bill! Coupled with a Groupon I didn't mind the 35 mile drive (actually was already in Scottsdale so an additional 7 miles). Would highly recommend but go hungry and ask for KIRSTIE. Had sampler platter and special Inferno chicken burrito. First time visitors get a free tamale! GREAT"}
{"text":"Excellent lobster street tacos. My wife absolutely loved them and she got me hooked to. Will surely be back. The drive from east Mesa was worth it."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in a long time. The food and service was outstanding. We asked for sour cream to offset the Inferno sauce. The sour cream and food was high quality. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone. Oh yeah, the service was spot on and even gave us \"to go\" tea drinks!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in my hotel guiding me to this place. Thought pretty bland taste.  The steak burrito was really lacking in flavor from the meat. I expect or hope for some local spices when in the area. Tortilla was overly doughy. Chips and salsa were good but average. No one in group had any one thing that was special."}
{"text":"Normally I would give this restaurant five stars for its frozen swirl margaritas and about two stars for its food until last night when I tried their Hatch Chile Verde Pork Bowl.  Holy crap is it sooo gooooood!!  So spicy that you'll feel the warmth in your chest and belly for a few hours after... but if you can handle the heat it's totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"We were greeted with a complimentary world famous Sweet Tamale since it was our time visiting. It was De-lish! The BOSS margarita (it is not weak!) pairs perfectly with the hatch chiles and other spices used to flavor their meals. I had the hatch chile shrimp & bacon relleno with black beans and rice. We also had an order of guac. It was all very fresh with lots of flavor. I'm happy we took our friends advice and went out of our way coming from Sedona to Phoenix Airport. It was worth it! And, now I'm full."}
{"text":"Our favorite in the area. Chips and guacamole are really good. Happy hour in the bar is a very good deal and it is a classy place to have dinner in the dining room.   This is where we take out of town guests looking to experience southwestern cuisine.   try the green chile corn tamales. Best west of Santa Fe."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 2.5 stars really. When we pulled up it looked packed but really it's just bc most the restaurant was sitting outside. Probably because of the nice nighttime weather but for me personally it was mainly due to the atmosphere inside. It was surprisingly cheap and blah looking. The outside patio is pretty nice looking (other than the bright hospital lights they have under the archways) so I assumed the inside would be of similar Taste. There's no where to stand in front of the reception podium without being in the way of foot traffic. The inside decor really is a stark contrast to the out. It's bright in all the wrong areas and lightning color it way off. It's resembles much more of a cheap 24 hr taco shop (which are great in their own right) and much less an upscale Mexican joint. 

They have a large cocktail menu but the cocktail I ordered just tasted like all bitters and tequila. There wine list is beyond horrible, which was again surprising due to the demographics, double surprising when I saw they had a sister restaurant called 'rhythm and wine'. I'm not much of a wine drinker but honestly their wine list is the worst I've seen in this part of town. 

The service seems to match the inside atmosphere.  It was busy so there's that, but it still took about 10 mins to get waters and chips and a few minutes after that we finally saw our server who had a bit of an attitude btw (someone must have said something to her bc she was forcefully trying to be more polite towards the end) 

Food was ok. Nothing really that special. Pricey for not so great mexican Food. I was really disappointed all around at this place. I was really hoping to like it. I'm in this area often and there doesn't seem to be any good Mexican places."}
{"text":"Staff was fast and friendly. Portions were decent, but there was no flavor in the chicken enchiladas, or chimichanga. Sadly disappointed with the food- good chips and salsa though!"}
{"text":"I have lived for 15+ years in the Pinnacle Peak neighborhood and considered this a very good Mexican restaurant.  I moved up to near Carefree about a year ago and decided to revisit the restaurant tonight.

This was a very bad experience.  I even questioned if the management had changed because I could not consider this the same restaurant.

The restaurant has been remodeled, I can only assume to get more hi-tops in the bar space but the atmosphere has been totally destroyed.

There were three of us at the table, two ordered fajitas and I had a \"Chimichanga\".

The chicken fajitas were totally dry, no seasoning on the undercook vegetables,  totally unacceptable.  My Chimi had never seen a fat frier to give the intended crispy covering. It was a soggy mushy presentation.

While I have enjoyed this restaurant for years, tonight's visit was the end.  I and party will never return.

I need a no star option on the rating list.  Stay away."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been open for quite some time now and going back after not liking the taste of the food the first time, my opinions are the same. This place does have some terrific plates but for me the taste is a too bland compared to other restaurants that I have been to in the valley."}
{"text":"went for the first time and had an amazing experience! great food, great drinks, and great service, her name was kim! I was bragging about how awesome this place was so I took a friend and had a completely different experience. the bartender was RUDE. she acted as if it was an annoyance to have customers at her bar. I tried to order food but could not get her attention to get a menu. I sat there for about 20 minutes with my empty margarita, thinking she would ask if I wanted another one but she never did, so I took my business elsewhere. very disappointing."}
{"text":"Love the margaritas of course. The only thing we've ever had on the menu were the fajitas. Never tried anything else because we liked the fajitas so so so much. The service was great. The atmosphere was conversation friendly and it's a great place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Truly one of the worst meals we have had since living in Scottsdale.  We went at lunch time and it tasted like bad leftovers from the night before. No flavor, the fajitas came out cold on a cold cast iron plate. Salsa is my gauge on Mexican and Pace Picante is far 
better than this. If you want great tacos, affordable prices and a charming restaurant go to Diego Pops. It is worth a little extra drive for all the things Jalapeño Inferno lacks.  Yuk!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food restaurant!!!!! Love their green chili!!! I would eat here every day! My husband likes the fajitas and of course their margaritas!  The flour tortilla chips are the best I've ever had! Have to try it!!! Both locations are nice, prefer the atmosphere at the Scottsdale road location"}
{"text":"Like its name, Jalapeno Inferno Bistro Mexicana has a correspondingly large food menu & drink menu, and it was all really good. I would definitely return here, whether for happy hour (okay definitely for happy hour) or dinner (also a definite yes). First of all, I LOVE the margarita sampler. Many brewpubs have beer samplers but this the first margarita sampler I've ever had the joy of ordering. Also the menu is quite large, has a ton of variety & a lot of interesting (much more than regular tex-mex) options, and has a lot of good vegetarian options.

My boyfriend & I tried six different margaritas. My favorite margarita was the mango which was ridiculously amazing. A lot of mango margaritas are too sweet or have a very processed fruit taste but not this one - it's perfectly balanced & fresh tasting. I generally really dislike margaritas that come out of the large frozen blended dispenser because they are usually way too low on alcohol and I generally prefer my margaritas on the rocks instead of blended, but the mango that good is super good. My boyfriend's favorite was the coconut. I thought the Texas-Ass Kick-Ass margarita was really smooth with the Shiner Bock floater, and it has a great name. The ones that did not impress was the Ultima (boring when there are other better choices & overpriced at $12) and the Pinnacle Peak Pomegranate (didn't actually taste like pomegranate). 

I had the veggie fajitas which were really good and big enough for two meals. All the components of this dish were outstanding. The black beans were really great & have a very good flavor (I think cumin). The guacamole was fresh, full of garlic & lemon, and deliciously chunky. The tortillas were so soft & pliable & thick - I'm not sure if they were freshly made because I didn't see a tortilla maker but they sure tasted that way. The vegetables were a little on the bland side but I added the table salsa & it was great. My boyfriend had the west texas bbq taco's and he really liked them and the mango-chiptole bbq sauce. Also the complimentary chips & salsa were ridiculously good - super thick fried chips and fresh chunky flavorful salsa.

We had awful service at the bar, as in I think that's the rudest a bartender has ever been to me. It took the longest time to get a drink menu and then to put in our drink order. She complained about my order for the sampler to me, to the other bartender, to the other patrons and even had the nerve to say to another patron 'I'm making these drinks terribly, don't order a sampler' loud enough for me and the entire bar to hear. It was awkward. Fortunately our actual server at our table was really nice & friendly."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night & the place was busy when we got there but the 3 of us got a seat outside right away. They brought us chips which were good, half of them were different & after my wife ate one she realized it was a flour chip. Very tasty but she is celiac so oops! We've never had flour chips brought out before. I guess we should have been suspicious and asked but oh well. We mentioned it to the waiter and he brought us all corn tortilla chips. 
  Besides that the food was good. We got Fajitas that the menu said were gluten-free. And they were very tasty. Apparently they had problems with the cooks and they were backed up in the kitchen,  but a lot of people checked on us to make sure we were OK. So overall the food and service was very good."}
{"text":"Veggie medley fajita. Homemade flour chips. Cheat meal!!!"}
{"text":"OK, really want to give this place a five, but I can't. Food like most places depends largely on knowing what to order. Fajitas rock by our standards. Here is my big GRIPE. We live close by and consider this our go - to Mex place. So I sign up for the e-mail specials and notices. Summer rolls around. Daily specials in addition to happy hour. The e-mail we recieved states clearly that on Monday ALL margaritas are half off with purchase of an entree. We stroll in and I order a Ultimate and am told that one is not half off. What?? I say, the e-mail clearly states and no exceptions are noted. I whip out my smart phone and show them the e-mail. The bartender/waitperson goes to ask manager, manager (who has seen our faces in there at least once a week, we always sit in the bar) says NO, we can reserve the right to say which ones are half off.....???????????
This is clearly BS to send out e-mails to your loyal customers stating one thing and then change it when they get there, as they see fit. I am accustomed to honoring my commitments both verbal and written. No apology from the \"manager\", a man at the moment, nothing, just a flat we aren't doing it. This drink was only a couple bucks more on the menu...Really?  Had a similiar experience last winter when the e-mail said all margaritas and then was told only house (Acapulco Gold). I don't do house..  This kind of attitude is close to sending me somewhere else, they need to shape up the attitude toward the locals who frequent here all year round.

UPDATE
Terry, a owner at Jalapeno, addressed this issue right away by sending me a reply with an apology and admission that I was right about the intent of the promotion to include all margaritas. I would truly recommend this restaurant to anyone, and regularly do. If you run into a like problem with a promotion, ask to address the owner(s), they care"}
{"text":"Food was good service was quick, will definitely go back. Portions were good. The rice was not my taste but my hubby enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Perfect place for ceviche. I'm a snob & I love theirs. Chips & salsa are of course addicting. Mini fundidos are off the chart & the pot roast tacos are always a fav. And with Cinco de Mayo coming up you can bet they will have a full house. I would suggest a reservation."}
{"text":"Loved the place!  

GREAT homemade chips and salsa to start.  Server was fantastic and friendly.  Large portions and delicious food"}
{"text":"Five hungry travelers, having spent the day in Sedona, embarked upon a journey in search of Mexican fare. Apple, the God of Technology, worked its magic and through the power of Yelp, we founds this place. 

We were imediately seated, surprising for a Saturday night and promptly received some tasty chips and salsa.  Our wonderful server, Jose, recommended the Boss Margarita, which 3 of us tried and agreed was \"boss\". My sister tried the black cherry sangria (served frozen), was like a cherry shake. 

We all really enjoyed our meals, my seafood relleno with just a bit of heat and sweet;  the fajitas were flavorful - quite a treat and the the chimmichunga was downright awesome. 

We mentioned to our server the Yelp coupon - the manager, James, stopped over to tell us this was a new promotion and shared the scoop on the renvoation. New tile, new ceiling and new artwork - Robert Shields (Shields and Young of 70's fame). 

When this weary traveler finds her way back to this area, this place is first on my list."}
{"text":"We went for lunch, fabulous,great service too! I had the \"Black and Blue salad\" and it was yummy, with a seasoned chicken breast. My lunch mate had the Signature Fundido, and went crazy! We would definately go again and soon!"}
{"text":"We went back for dinner last night and all was good. Shrimp fajitas came out piping hot. Chicken fajitas, hot and plentiful. My enchiladas, hot and super flavorful. The whereabouts of the microwave? Unknown but it wasn't used on anything we ordered."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  When you come into the restaurant it seems like your coming through the back or a side exit . There is a checkout in both sides where some people walk up to pay there bill, others pickup takeout, and people come in to be seated. Then instead of walking to the seating area. There are seats all long the hallway as well as the rest of the restaurant, so it can be uncomfortable if you're stuck in the hallway seating as we were this time. The waitress was incredibly rude and seemed very put out and bothered to be working there. She repeated several times \"you only want to order waters\" for our drink order which was odd. It was so uncomfortable I finally added an iced tea. I've had some of their drinks before including something with a black cherry type of flavor which was awful. I have decided this is simply not a place to waste money on drinks but I really didn't appreciate the failed upselling by the waitress either. When the food finally came we were dissapointed to say the least. The spinach enchiladas were very overcooked. The tortilla shells and rice were very hard and difficult to chew. This has happened occasionally in the past and I thought it was a fluke but now it is happening every time. The rice was practically inedible. The side of black beans were also slightly hard and undercooked but not as bad as the main dish."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and I loved it even more. I was wishy washy about what I wasted, Candace was a peach. Didn't rush me, then brought me the drink I wanted from the moment she spoke about it. Let's face it she knew the customer better. The drink a blue margarita. Then fabulous chips,salsa abd huge plate of guacamole! I knew I'd never have room for the dinner lol. Huge chimichanga,I don't remember the name but it was huge. Took half home. I loved the manager stopping by to ask how things were. To me that always shows they care. I loved the night out at this fabulous smelling restaurant. I'd definitely go back and refer others. Thank you for terrific service and food!"}
{"text":"Spendy for a Mexican joint. The manager walks around and looks at the people way to much. Creepy! If you do go try the Buritto Inferno...HOT!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is not a good as it used to be.  I am constantly surprised how hard it is to find good, consistent Mexican food in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  I will keep looking but disappointed this place isn't better because it is so close to my house."}
{"text":"The food tasted good. If you have a mexican craving then this will satisfy that kick. I like that they had all traditional american mexican food options plus they have items with their own unique twist. Their chips and salsa were tasty and fresh. Their dinner selection is plentiful. I got the Signature Fundido and it was really good. It weighed like a brick. The chicken was well seasoned and the sauce they put on top makes the dish. The servers were also great. 

The only thing that i did not like was that we got put on a table that was just too small. WE\ had 4 adults, 1 toddler, and a baby. So with all the plates and drinks there wasnt any space on the table. It was hard to eat. Also, i had to the senior citizen move and bust my phone out to get enough light to read the menu. Just too dark in there.  Other than that everything was good."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. Love their lobster tacos and I like the fact that they mix corn and flour chips."}
{"text":"This is my family's go-to spot for mexican food. We consistently receive top-notch service and great quality food.  I love their homemade chips and salsa, especially the flour chips! The green corn tamales are fantastic, and most portions are big enough to share. Yes, it is pricey, but not exorbitant for the area. 

We always sit in the bar area to take advantage of the happy hour specials. We typically avoid the main dining room, because the bar area includes plenty of seating options: booths, low-tables, and high-tables. There's also an extensive outdoor patio.

Happy hour runs M-F from 3:30-6:30. Half off all appetizers and few dollars off margaritas. Check the chalkboard in the bar for all the specials. I typically just go with a Cuervo or Don Julio margarita, but they also have some usual picks such as a prickly pear margarita and a mojito-rita!

They offer a lunch menu (even during weekends), which includes a two item combo for $8 and three item for $11. Also look out for game day specials on Sundays during football season. Overall, a great neighborhood restaurant and happy hour spot!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge jalapeño inferno fan! Never been with a crowd that didn't all love their food. Vegetarians try the vegetable fajitas, my step mom raved over them. I was extremely satisfied with my margarita, the service and the food. Highly recommend for lunch or dinner!!!"}
{"text":"This was our second time visiting this restaurant and we had another great experience. The hostess actually suggested a table for us and asked our opinion rather than just leading us to our spot and disappearing. We sat on the patio and she suggested we sit by the little creek where we could hear the running water and the ambience was nice. The food, while spicey as the name would suggest, was delicious and arrived quickly. 
We also had the same waiter again that we had for lunch on our first visit a couple of months ago--Tyler and he was great at his job, something I am always relieved and happy to take note of."}
{"text":"So good!!  Basket of chips has both flour and corn chips.  Flour chips are really good.   Hard shell chicken taco was excellent...tastes like they made the shell as opposed to store bought.  Cheese enchilada was nice and cheesy.  Service was great.  Only reason I didnt give 5 stars was bland salsa and a green corn tamale that was too sweet.  This is a good mexican restaurant and I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot because they are so close to my home, however, this is not a destination for me anymore.  Last time we came here it was for my parenting group's moms night out.  The food is not very good, the service is mediocre.  Some of the margaritas are still good, but not enough for me to want to come here.  So sad!"}
{"text":"My wife and I was told about this place from our hotel concierge. We checked it out for lunch last November and loved it. The sweet tamale appetizer is amazing! I had a spicy enchilada and it was really good. Crowds seemed high which was a good sign that it is popular. If we come back to visit AZ again we will go back"}
{"text":"Love their chips and salsa! I had the tacos for taco Tuesday and they were delish and my husband had a sampler platter which was yummy too! They also have a pretty good happy hour. My husband and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Super tasty, fresh and crunchy chips~ corn & flour was a fun surprise! Fresh and chunky salsa was really good too! I used my free Yelp guacamole coupon for checking in  and we really enjoyed that while we waited. My husband got a Boss Margarita and it was very good!!! My chili rellenos were good with the Green sauce  and I asked for a few corn tortillas- yum! My husband liked the pollo fundito but would have preferred it to not have onions and peppers inside. It was more like fajitas inside, but good! Excellent service- we will be back again!"}
{"text":"First time here? Free tamale y'all ! Green sweet corn...and it's huge. Yum. 

Very tasty prickly pear margaritas served in a very fun tall glass. Only place I've seen outside of Aqui that has this sweet little gem.

Steak salad had a ton of steak, and my hub liked his dish too. Quick service, cute patio...nice lunch. Surprising find in a strip mall. Fun way to start an anniversary mini-vacation."}
{"text":"Earlier this week, we used our handy Google mobile app to locate what we hoped was authentic Mexican food. We were craving flavorful salsa and well-spiced meat dishes after a long, warm day in the desert. What we found here was slightly different than we were expecting......The chips were made of corn AND flour tortillas, which was a nice surprise but way too filling while waiting for our food. The salsa was just fresh tomatoes with some cilantro (or maybe even parsley?) for color.
It was \"Taco Tuesday\", which here meant all-you-can-eat of crunchy or soft with 3 different filling choices.\"Hamburger Helper-esque flavored shredded beef tacos\", according to my teen son. Ooops :( I ordered the \"award-winning green chili sweet tamale\". I fear they left the winners with the judges, for they didn't make it to my table. The tamales were dry and contained about a tablespoon of chopped chiles throughout. And, although they were sweet as promised, they lacked depth of flavour overall.
The service was fine and the refills on soft drinks was fair, but I really was hoping for more. We are in town for a couple of weeks and may try it one more time since it's close to our accommodations, but with all these Tex-Mex and MexiCali flavour houses to choose from, it will take a lot to win us over for a better review."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise. The staff wasn't bad. My family loved the sauces that they used. They serve in good portions. This felt like a higher quality Mexican food compared to what I am used to seeing. If you're looking for Mexican food, you couldn't do bad here at least during lunch time. I have not been there at dinner time."}
{"text":"Came here last night with some friends.  Had me some of the Valle Verde Spinach Enchiladas.  Awesome.  Super tasty.  Even the chips that they brought out before our meal were pretty awesome.  There were light and fluffy- very fresh.

I'll definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch yesterday and found out it was the last day for half off margs today! Had to come in! We have had the lunch shrimp fajitas which were amazing, the mahi tacos, and anejo lime shrimp entrees. Everything is delicious and filling. Jordyn has been taking care of us tonight and she is awesome as well! I'm in the industry myself and believe she is a wonderful server. My boyfriend and I will back again soon!"}
{"text":"Jalapeño is a nice local Mexican restaurant, and depending upon your tastes, you will either like Jalapeño or nearby X Tapa better.

The major drawback for us to Jalapeno's is not the food, but the atmosphere.  The place is very noisy.  We are parents of two twenty somethings and whenever we're at Jalapenos there seems to be a bunch of out of control kids who's parents have selective hearing and are enjoying a few margaritas.  Hey, we've all been there; and, I mean all of us.  But, that's what babysitters are for, right?

Okay, now for the food.  The Salas is good, but the Margaritas are better!  For the most part the food lacks spice, but that's okay.  The BBQ taco is one of the reason we come back.  But, leave the kids at home, okay, or go to Chipotle instead."}
{"text":"We were visiting family in AZ and it seems that this is everybody's favorite meeting spot for dinner and drinks in the area. Sure enough, the place looks super busy, with friendly service and a solicitous hostess. We sat on the patio and admired the world going by, had good conversation going and ordered some drinks. The margarita special was served in tall water glasses, filled to the brim with ice and very light on the tequila - at least to my East Coast palate (I've had drinks in TX, CA and Mexico that put everything else to shame, so...). Chips and salsa appeared quickly and they are nothing special, but okay. Now to the food. It is in one word terrible! This is not Southwestern Mex, Tex or any kind of Mex, it is just awful! The Shrimp Tequila Ceviche had canned Thai mini-shrimp in it, and was watered down a lot. I had no time to finish it since the main dishes came out practically 2 minutes later. On the advice of several family members I ordered the Chile Rellenos and another of us visitors ordered one of Kelli's combos, I think it had the green corn something or other. Okay, those chiles were flat, flat, flat, were swimming in grease, had a thick blanket of cheese on them and had probably spent some time in the microwave and under the lamps. The refried beans looked like they had been diluted with water and whizzed in a blender and the rice was close to inedible. The green corn tamales were nothing to write home about. Only the steak fajitas were somewhat palatable. Our local family appeared to be faithful patrons, so we kept mum, but I doubt that this restaurant would warrant a return visit unless they get their act together in terms of expediting the food properly, not watering down drinks and definitely in the food quality sector."}
{"text":"Good Mexican Mexican food. Generous portions, good flavor, been in Scottsdale for a very long tome and has been recognized locally for it's food quality, I'm hooked on the flour tortilla chips! You can request to have only flour instead of the corn and flour mix they usually bring. Salsa is more salsa fresca than blender salsa. Outdoor patio has misters and is very quaint. Good Eats..."}
{"text":"This is a bit over-due and ergo hazy....but I remember the chips and salsa were nothing short of AH-MAZING! 

I was in town for Thanksgiving and the man and I made the trek here to meet up with an old high school friend that I hadn't seen in....well, in awhile. 

The food was great and the chips and salsa...did I mention? Ah-mazing! 
We stayed around after they left and moved to the bar but oddly enough after another round or so of drinks and way before the ASU/CAL game was over the place was closing up and like 10or 11ish. Weird! Other than the chips/salsa I don't really have a reason to drive to BFE  (Mom in Surprise, Dad in Fountain Hills and I live out of state) but I really enjoyed the place!"}
{"text":"There is a new Jalapeno Inferno now in DC Ranch in Scottsdale.  I have been to the 23587 N Scottsdale Rd location a few times and always though of it as just okay, so when the new location came to DC Ranch, we though we would give it a try.  We arrived at 2pm and there were very few patrons inside and nobody at the bar.  We sat down and ordered a beer.  20 minutes later they arrived.  Not a great first impression, but at least they were cold.  The beers were the highlight of our visit.  We ordered a cheese crisp to start off with.  We usually don't order appetizers, but it was a late lunch and we were hungry.  I don't know WHAT kind of oil they used, but the crisp tasted like rancid oil...horrible!!!!
By the way, the chips and salsa were very mediocre and absolutely nothing to write home about.  The chips were not warm (the way I like them), and the salsa was watery and tasteless.  Then...our food came.  It was truly awful.  My son had a machaca burro, enchilada style.  It was red chili with sauce and the sauce on top had a film on it that looked disgusting.  I am quite certain that this was a frozen burrito that had red enchilada sauce poured on top and heated.  He threw up after a few bites.  I had the pollo fundido.  It was equally bad.  It was full of green pepper, so much onion, and very little chicken, that I couldn't eat it.  The cream cheese sauce that I always love on this dish was dry and tasteless.  
When our server finally came around to check on us and asked how the food was, I couldn't help but make a face and tell her the truth.  She came back with the check and said \"we took a little off\".  Well, a little off was $3.00 and our check was still $65.  I requested that she take mine and my sons meals off the tab as neither were eaten past the initial bites.  She went tot the manager who did take them off the check.  We will NEVER be back!  The service was okay, but not good and the food was terrible."}
{"text":"This is a big restaurant, way bigger than it even looks from the outside.  We sat outside and watched the sunset which just adds to the surrounding ambiance.  

I saw some reviews below mention the chips and salsa, but omg don't get me started on how good it was!  I mean we were like vultures attacking prey and had to ask for like 4 refills of the free chips and salsa.  

I actually can't do too much spice so seeing the dishes were not really spicy suited my tastebuds.  The chicken fajitas were good, comes with rice, beans, guac, sour cream, cheese and tortillas.  My family liked their dishes as well and commented on the shredded chicken being really tasty.  

We will def be coming back here in the future.  One mention is that they do offer a coupon on their website for $5 off...so go look!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at Jalapeno's outside on the patio last night and our food and service was outstanding!  The weather was perfect, and the guacamole was one of the best I've ever eaten. We had the most delicious sweet green corn tamale, lobster tacos, and chicken enchilada. It was wonderful and I was able to navigate around the menu due to my gluten issues. Everyone was happy there and we had a lovely time!"}
{"text":"Service was iffy but oh Lordy was the food amazing!! Definitely going back and hopefully I will have a chance to try their margaritas. I'm super picky about Mexican food and I am glad to say that is authentic. Their soft tacos and enchiladas are a little soggy which sucks but minus the texture... they are great."}
{"text":"The ambiance both inside and out is wonderful. Lobster street tacos are amazing and the fried ice cream has a nice raspberry sauce. Truly a delight!"}
{"text":"Cinco de Mayo disaster...food was gross and server was obviously overwhelmed. Never a good sign when your server doesn't know the tequila menu in a Mexican food restaurant. Highly doubt I'd ever come back here..."}
{"text":"The dinner we had here was OK... nothing to rave about. The tortilla chips were very good as others have mentioned... a mix of corn and deep fried flour chips. The salsa was OK... lots of fresh tomato chunks but not much kick. We shared \"steak fajitas for two\"... plenty of tenderized flank steak but not much seasoning. The sides of Mexican rice and re-fried beans were bland... didn't taste homemade (could be). Gringo Mex as others have mentioned.
The margaritas were blended well... not too large but they did have a kick to them. 
We were told the drink/appetizer happy hour specials only apply to the bar area... only after we were seated in the dining room (they did offer to let us move). I've run into this a few times... think it should be stated up front. From reading other reviews, it sounds like they may honor happy hour rates on the patio as well (we were not told this)??
The service was OK... a bit slow at the end but I think our waiter was in training and the place was very crowded (on a weeknight!). The noise level didn't add to the ambiance. 
I wouldn't really rush to come back here. I might stop in and give it another chance if I were nearby to try some appetizer and drink specials... seated in the bar area."}
{"text":"Great fresh chips & salsa, and we had shrimp fajitas & spinach & cheese & regular cheese enchiladas & all the food was so good! Service friendly & attentive. The iced tea is passion fruit infused & yum also."}
{"text":"Jalapeño Inferno is now a great new addition to my list of lunch spots close enough to the airpark to not be absurdly late for work! I recently went here for a team lunch after doing a little research and was pleasantly surprised by how good things turned out. 

The chips and salsa were great, but the salsa lacked that gritty (I'm in a hole-in-the-wall) flavor that I truly love. The spiciness is toned down a little more than I like too, but the flavors were very tasty,especially their version of a spicy selection. The chips though, that's where they got me... Some of the chips are regular corn chips that you would expect in a Mexican restaurant (but with quality) and the other chips were just cuts of tortilla that were deep fried! I couldn't stop eating them!

For my real lunch, after eating more than enough calories in chips, was Courtney's Favorite Burrito Inferno with chicken. It was off the very hot portion of the menu. The chicken inside the burrito was awesome. It was nice and blackened before being chopped up for my burrito and I could tell. The burrito itself was topped with Inferno sauce and hatch chiles, and it totally won me over. It wasn't the best burrito I've ever had, but I'd be lying if I didn't say it was really good. I also got to try some of the Mexican pizza. If you can imagine what good nachos taste like, you'll understand the flavor, but now imagine that feeling of the perfect bite when eating nachos throughout eat bite! The Mexican pizza at Jalapeño's calms down your brain's instant guilt trip by rewarding your taste buds with a  perfect bite every time.

Jalapeño's was great for lunch and it was great for a group. The waitress seemed a little bit impatient, but next time I visit here I will update and clarify if that was just a fluke. If you're in the airpark for lunch, drive a couple miles north and give this place a try; it ain't bad."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing experience and amazing people!  Go see Josh at the bar and you're guaranteed a great time!"}
{"text":"Terrible. We will NEVER eat here again. The appetizer sampler was horrible and one of the items was so salty I almost spit it out! The pizza was cold in the middle which was surprising because the server warned us to be careful that the plate was hot. The manager came over to check on us and didn't even offer to comp the pizza after we told her it was cold! There wasn't an option for zero stars or I wouldn't have given them any.  Not worth it!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Black and Blue Salad, and the Flan for dessert. We also got a basket of the flour tortilla chips, instead of the corn tortilla chips. Everything was exquisitely delicious. I only wish we lived nearer to this restaurant because it would become a regular place for us. Sooooooooooooo good!

P.S. It's a little too pricey for my liking, but I'm a cheapskate and it costs about what one would expect, given the location."}
{"text":"My love and I sat outside (finally cool enough to do so here in Arizona) - service was spot on. Enjoyed our Cadillac Margaritas, the Signature Fundido and the Tequila Lime Shrimp Tacos blew us away!! So amazingly delish! Manager was always attentive and walking around to make sure everyone was o.k.

We left happy, our bellies full and relaxed.

If you want some authentic Mexican food that isn't covered in enchilada sauce this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere at this place!  The mushroom and goat cheese enchiladas were great and so was the peach melba margarita!  The chips and salsa were quite tasty too!  My only complaint was that our server kept trying to rush us even though there were other open tables for new guests."}
{"text":"This place had been a staple for my wife and I when we first moved out here. Their chips and salsa are awesome! I would recommend getting their Espinaca con Queso appetizer but it seems like it has gone downhill a bit in the recent months. However, it is hatch chile season right now at Jalapeno's so I would recommend trying their Espinaca with chorizo and hatch chiles (a twist on their original year round Espinaca). It is a lot better than the original and even more addicting.

The service has been spotty in all the times we go there. If you want superb service, you might want to look elsewhere. However, their Happy Hour is fairly decent and if you want an early \"dinner\" go there for some appetizers and chips/salsa. I would recommend the Hatch Chile quesadilla with a side of their Inferno sauce (definitely not a place for the health food junkie). Their Cheese crisp is also excellent! 

Entrees are good but I generally get the same thing every time so I can not comment on the rest of the menu. 

Overall, I would recommend going at least once (esp now during hatch season), but sign up for their Inferno Club on line and get $5 off your first meal."}
{"text":"We went to Jalapeno's for lunch on Sunday and the experience was great. The service was fast and the food came out quickly. They have a great patio area to enjoy. Would come back again for the cheese crisp and enchiladas!"}
{"text":"The green chille tacos are really good, but they are a bit spicy! I'm not a huge spicy person so I had a bit of a surprise biting into them and actually have green Chile's on the tacos instead of a sauce. As far as drinks go, my table tried the blood orange margarita - tasty!, market street mixer - this one was kind of a disappointment, it was described to have açaí in it, but I could only taste tequila, and the Paloma - delicious."}
{"text":"Just finished a great meal with the family tonight, what I really want to tell about is the last time we came here. We were starving for Great Mexican food and we had just been taken to our table, unfortunately our son had wasn't feeling so hot... As soon as we got seated he tossed up everywhere! Feeling frustrated as we were all hungry I took the dude outside, to my surprise Josh had come out with a glass of ice water for him! Talk about service and going the extra mile! Thank you bud, we appreciate it and although the food is good that kind of service will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night. Sat at the bar and got a avion margarita that was on special, tasted really good after a long day in the sun! Ordered off the 3 combo selection section, food was so good I took the leftovers home. Finished off the night with a chocolate tequila shot for desert, WOW! So smooth and refreshing. Would recommend this place to anyone that wants a quick bite and a good margarita!"}
{"text":"This is great Mexican food...With a lot of places to choose from I am definitely a fan...The owners can be a bit standoffish and times but hey whatever...

What we really care about is the food. SO what can I honestly say is great...Well the Sweet Corn Tamale is by far the most amazing thing I've ever tasted (OK not really but the best thing I've tasted at jalapeno's). They have great Fajita's, and some great combo meals. 

Margarita's are yummy and they have a great specials such as Taco Tuesday's (All you can eat Taco's). Margarita Monday's jump on their website to see them. Definitely worth the drive up to North Scottsdale.

As for the chips and salsa hold the phone...They have corn and flour chips mixed with the yummiest salsa! Now they just need a guacamole made table side (or one that tastes good) 

Overall the food is great, the service is mediocre never outstanding but the food makes up for it...

Enjoy..."}
{"text":"A business colleague took me to lunch here last week. The food is great!! The service was very good. You have to try their chips, they are out of this world. Homemade, corn and flour chips freshly deep fried.. YUM!"}
{"text":"This was our first time to this place and we could not be more impressed! Our server Dyllan was a rock star making sure our experience was perfect. We tried the green chili tamale to start with our prickly pear and Acapulco margaritas. The prickly pear was a bit sweet for my taste but my husband LOVED it! I had a combo chili relleno and red chili beef soft taco EXCELLENT. Husband had the burrito enchilada style - also really great. Dyllan came over to offer spicier salsa and make sure everything was wonderful. We were pleasantly taken back  and will certainly be visiting again."}
{"text":"This is my third attempt tonight  to review this place.  The yelp app failed me twice so i am now on my computer,  But i enjoyed tonight enough to keep at it until i could do this review.  We discovered this place a while back when they did a groupon.   We love it.  Their flour tortilla chips are such a great start, and their appetizers and food are delicious.  The thing that made me take the time to do this review was the great service that we got from our waitress, Savannah.  Rarely do you get someone who is so friendly, helpful, and efficient.  And she never left us hanging needing her, nor did she make us feel rushed.  We thought it was impressive enough to tell the manager and the yelp world.  If we lived in Arizona full time, we would go there more often but we will definitely check in whenever we can."}
{"text":"My family's favorite Mexican food since we moved here 10 years ago.  Flour chips and salsa are the best!"}
{"text":"Lunch was a great experience, the artwork caught my attention before anything. The servers were attentive and the food was out before I could even blink. It was busy with people during the lunch hour, so that much mean the food is quite tasty.

I enjoyed chicken fajitas (but the chicken was a little dry) as my entree along with the nachos and salsa as a complimentary starter.  I thoroughly enjoyed the salsa at Jalapeno, they give you two kinds - a traditional and a hot salsa.  I would recommend stopping here for a Mexican lunch if you're near this area.  They have a great outdoor patio, but that is only for the nice weather here in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon for this place and used it on a Saturday afternoon after hiking.  The food was amazing and the waitress was super awesome.  They served us complimentary tamales because it was our first time eating there!  

I've been back a couple of times since and intend to keep doing so!"}
{"text":"Totally giving this spot 5 stars because the green tamales are AMAZING!  ....but the service was a bit slow today. In their defense... there were a few huge parties, snowbirds are back and it's a couple days before Thanksgiving! Hubby had \"The Boss\" margarita that, he says, made him feel like \"an employee\" (it was killer strong).  Chips were a combo of corn and fried flour tortillas with salsa.... very good! I cannot rave enough about the green tamales!"}
{"text":"We love this place as a family!! Awesome service every time we go in! Aaron in the bar area was so sweet to our 8 year old daughter too. He sat and spoke with her, and even gave her some motivation to improve on her coloring. When she told him she thought it looked bad, he said., \"well I think it looks awesome, but if you think it's bad, how are you going to improve it.\" I love that because she thought about it and had a solution. He definitely went above and beyond. We eat out often, so service like that really blows us away, especially when you eat out 4-5 times per week. 

We probably go here 2-4 times per month since it right down the road! They have awesome deals too! For the summer they do a daily special, which we love! Also their happy hour lasts until 6:30, and offers $5 margaritas (get the frozen Aculpolco...trust me!) and 1/2 off all appetizers. The sampler platter is amazing, and plenty of food for a couple at only $7.50, which means more margaritas! We also love their combos that allow you to choose 2 or 3 items. Beware though because the food comes out piping hot!! You may have to wait five minutes to enjoy, although I much prefer this over cold food! This is a great family restaurant! We love it, and I think you will too!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the allure is with this place. Maybe because it's in Scottsdale?? We happened to be in the area on a Friday evening so decided to give Jalapeno Inferno a try. There was already a line forming so we took that as a good sign. A couple of seats opened up at the outside bar so we escaped putting our name on a list. The bartender was friendly, but perfunctory. We studied the menu while we waited for our drinks munched on chips. The salsa was very flavorful, and the chips were part corn- part flour. Maybe I'm just a purist, but really?? Chips made from flour tortillas? Ick! I guess that's how they utilize stale flour tortillas, and the snowbirds probably like 'em. I hate rummaging through the basket to get the corn tortilla chips!

For the entrees we decided on the Tomatillo Chicken Enchiladas and Baja Fish Tacos. Both dishes were mediocre. The tacos were short on fish. The enchiladas had an after-hot, which I liked, but they really weren't anything to write home about.
Glad we tried the place. I can't think of why we'd go back when there are so many really good Mexican restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent!  My husband had the surf and turf fajitas and I had the green hatch street tacos.  It was excellent!!  I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Good food, fantastic sangrias, way too much salt. Not so last time so something seems to have happened this time."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here just by chance and it is DELICIOUS our waitress Dana was amazing. She was very prompt and personable that made us feel right at home. The food is fresh and authentic. By far the flour tortilla chips and the cheese dip is a must. We'll be coming again."}
{"text":"My husband and I go to Jalepeno's at least twice a week. We love the salsa, food and the service. Our favorite waitress Samatha always is so cheerful and full of life. Knows exactly our drink order. Even if we are not in her section she brings our drinks before we even order them from another waiter. She is very personable. The fajitas are awesome. And the enchiladas are terrific. We really have never had a bad meal there.  We always enjoy our meals there."}
{"text":"Went there for the fourth time last week. First, a little about my visit history. 

1st visit: went with a friend. It was her suggestion. She and her sister love the restaurant and I agreed to go. The food was tasty but the margarita was not worth the money. My MIL makes much better margaritas at home. 

2nd visit: went with same friend when she came into town again. Food was okay. 

3rd visit: when my dad came into town for a visit, we wanted to take him to a Mexican restaurant. This was by far the worst of the four visits. In fact, it was so horrible I attempted to contact the owner quite a few times. Finally, she contacted me back and made a bunch of excuses for why should didn't call back. She said she would send us a gift certificate to treat us for the horrible experience. Lie. Here was our experience that time: the server was extremely rude, especially to our kids who were seated and not being loud or crazy. She seemed less than interested in us and rarely came to check on us. After eating the hot salsa I asked for a refill because I was in desperate need, and she gave me an attitude. The grossest part was that she was wearing a tank top and sweating. My husband took big issue with this, but I was more concerned about the food and service. The kids' burritos were DRY DRY DRY and looked like they were microwaved to death. When we asked the server a question about an item she ignored us, refilled my drink finally, and quickly left. I promise you that at no point were we rude to her - I'm too afraid of spit in my food to do that at any restaurant ;)

4th visit (and final): we took my dad for a redo. A different server took care of us and she was VERY nice. It was the final straw when our meals came out literally five minutes after we ordered. I'm not saying I don't appreciate the quick service, but it was telling that the plates were piping hot, as well. I'd rather not pay $13 for a microwaved chimichanga. Also, my daughter got a burrito that again was dry (I wish I would have made her order something different) and my son got a taco that looked like it had been sitting out for hours - he ate maybe two bites. 

I know everyone seems to love this place, but I'd rather go somewhere where the food is freshly made and not microwaved beyond an inch of its life."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place. Been going there for years and there's not a single person I wouldn't recommend it to. The other location.. not so much. This one is always exceptional. Have had 2 problems in the past 12 years I've been going here and both were fixed professionally and in a timely manner. Incredible."}
{"text":"I have been to both locations and the green corn tamales were consistently great at both. My husband and I loved everything that we tasted which has so far been the chips, salsa, fundidos, steak fajitas, green corn tamales, of course beans and rice, and guacamole. Yum!! Keep up the awesome work!"}
{"text":"Liked their chips (especially the flour tortillas).  Their salsa is good and service is attentive.  Great family dinner location!"}
{"text":"Holy crap - this place has the best kept secret - an amazing taco Tuesday deal! All you can eat tacos for $9.99? what?!?! Even if you only eat two, they're amazing, and it saves you $5 on their regularly priced taco plates. Also on Tuesday they offer a $5 top shelf margarita. :::smiles::: It's a from scratch bar too . . . . so real juice, not a mix. I can't believe it took me so long to figure out this magical secret!"}
{"text":"Would be a solid 5 star if they improved their chips and especially their salsa. The entrees I have tried here were all very good. I ordered from the special Hatch Chile menu both times. The chicken enchiladas with the queso sauce were outstanding. Good service. Bar tables have a better ambiance than the dining room."}
{"text":"Everything was barely okay. Service was adequate. It was 4pm on a weekday, the place was deserted,  but we were told we'd have to move to get Happy Hour pricing. No Happy Hour menu but apparently beer was a big 75 cents saving. Not worth standing up for. Dinner was edible but unremarkable. Prices seemed reasonable until the food came. Plates so hot they'd fry your fingers and pretty tasteless fare. Like a Mexican menu at TGIF. Boring. Disappointing We won't be back."}
{"text":"Always get great service and even better food! Love this place!!! The staff there is always so polite. I have never had to wait for a table even during a busy night!"}
{"text":"All you can eat tacos for 10$ on Tuesday! Amazing quality and flavor! I'll be there every Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Although I have been here a few times, I wasn't very impressed with the food or the service. They offer Happy Hour from 4:30pm - 6:30pm M - F. We went Monday at 5pm and were quickly seated in the main room. We asked about the 1/2 price appetizers for happy hour but were told that it was in the Cantina room only. After already been seated and served drinks, we didn't want to move to save a couple of dollars but it left a bad taste in our mouth. Service was slow. We order a 2nd round of drinks as we got our entrees and they didn't arrive until we were finished eating. My \"Top Shelf\" Margarita tasted like soap water. Although my shrimp taco's were good, my wife's grab meat rellenos was terrible. My son ordered the cheese casadilla which had chillis. He thought it was too spicy so he didn't eat it. I think this place is starting to go down hill."}
{"text":"The first thing that I noticed was this place was pretty quick in service considering how busy they were. Everything was in generous portion and cooked just right. I had an incredibly delicious carne asada fajita platter. I have to commend the cook that night for finding that sweet spot in preparing the steak, it was a perfect medium. 

Make sure you order from the drink menu! Everyone at the table had something different and they were all tasty."}
{"text":"While in town for Spring training, we stopped here for dinner and thought the food was wonderful.  As everyone else mentions the chips are a unique mixture of flour/corn tortillas with a little extra seasoning on some.  We also asked for a little spicier than normal salsa (not the inferno one!), and it was perfect with the chips and the dinner.

My husband and I both got the Rockin Shrimp Enchiladas and they were the highlight of the meal!  They were really good and with the extra spicy salsa, they became excellent!

The drinks were so-so.  I had the special tangerine margarita - which was okay, but then I got the Prickly Pear margarita and it was super sweet...too sweet for my liking.

This place does seem to get busy - even on a Sunday night.  Unfortunately, it was too cool out to sit outside, but the patio looked nice.

We topped the meal off with their chocolate chip cookie and ice cream in a cast iron skillet.  This, too, was great!

If we're in the area again, we would definitely stop for for the food."}
{"text":"Corn Tamales are the best. Plus their flour chips and salsa are so addicting. My husband and I love going here for Mother's Day brunches, date nights and with our family. It sounds spicy by the name but it's delicious. Definitely check it out. They also have deals for Groupon to check out."}
{"text":"Nolan is the best server and the chips and salsa are so good. I love TACO Tuesday!! and their House frozen margaritas!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome, service is fast and friendly. The chips are awesome too.  Never had chips like these.  This is a great lunch spot but the dinner is fantastic too.  Atmosphere is cosy with the right mood lighting for evening.  Shrimp tacos were fantastic and we ordered a picture of margaritas.  Best margarita I had in a long time."}
{"text":"I have been going to jalapenos for some time now and usually get fajitas, 50 percent of the time we dine in the restaurant.
The service is usually good and we have a great time. But every time I get take out they screw my order up and forget something. They need a better system for take outs."}
{"text":"It seemed like we drove for quite a while from Old Scottsdale for some Mexican food. At least it was very busy, so that was a good sign. We were greeted and seated within seconds while our drinks and free chips with salsa followed soon after. I can't say I love the flour chips mixed in with the corn chips but the salsa was quite good with either of them. We lapped up the small dish they gave us and asked for more. They brought a huge bowl and we ate it too. We also ordered pico de gallo for the chips. It was very good as well and I found myself mixing the two on my chips. 

We had the Carne Asada which came with vegetables and rice. I had a side of re fried beans because Carne Asada seems to go with re fried beans for me. The steak was a real steak, no skirt steak here. It was quite good and it had all the \"Mexican\" flavor that I was hoping for. Cooked to order and seasoned deliciously, this steak is worth coming back for. The beans were ok, just re fried beans and not worth ordering as a side. The vegetables were just that, but it was all worth every penny because of the steak. 

The waitress suggested the honey flan with caramel sauce and whip cream as it was her favorite. I'm not sure I've ever had flan but it was delicious. The dessert was kind of like a thick pudding but I loved the texture and I loved the taste. I thought I was too full for desert but I finished this. 
The service was very good and it was very quick. The whole meal for two came in at $45. Nice place to eat."}
{"text":"This place has become a tradition for us on Mother's Day.  Can't speak to the rest of the year, but on Mother's Day (and Easter) they put out a brunch that we really enjoy - reasonably priced, very good Mexican/brunch food, great atmosphere.  We were there today with our party of about 15, and the service was attentive and friendly, with us as well as with the kids in our group.  We didn't feel hurried and really had a fantastic time.  The cheese enchiladas were particularly good, as were the huevos rancheros.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, we just had such a good time tonight at Jalapeno's. On Tuesday's they do Taco Tuesday and let me tell you, we ate to our fill. Tried a bunch of different style tacos and they all were delicious. Margaritas were awesome too. We'll probably be back next Tuesday as well."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant.  Had the chicken fajitas, delicious.  Hubby had the carne asada, yummy.  I will get that next time.  Good margharitas and great salsa.  Service was quick, staff friendly."}
{"text":"It's Hatch Chile season and the employees here are very excited.
 Jalapeno Inferno has a separate menu dedicated to food items that contain Hatch Chiles and if you were to ask for recommendation of what to order they will tell you to order off this menu, which of course, we did. 

To drink, I ordered their Down the Hatch Margarita that contains, guess what....Hatch Chiles! Two different employees passionately suggested this so I was down to try and enjoy this drink. FAIL! So incredibly disgusting that it almost came back up the hatch. Now, I'm not sure if my taste buds haven't matured enough to appreciate Hatch Chile season  (that only lasts about a month or so), but my date wasn't a fan of this drink either and I was jealous of his Corona. Thank god the glass had a salt rim because that was the only way I could get the drink down. For my entree I ordered carne asada fajitas that came with 3 freshly warmed tortillas, guacamole, sour cream, shredded cheese, pico de gallo, and a side of refried beans and rice. Yummy! My date order Hatch Chile enchiladas that were really good and should definitely be tried. The chips and salsa were delicious, but who doesn't love deep fried tortilla chips?

Service was speedy and the staff was very friendly. The restaurant itself, is very clean, neat, and bright. I would give Jalapeno Inferno another go around if I'm up the area."}
{"text":"Did was really good and service was excellent. Our waitress was Bree and she was fantastic. My only complaint was that the child's taco was too greasy and apparently we have to tell the kitchen in advance to hold the grease. However, they were willing to swap my child's plate, which is excellent service. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place has to die for blood orange margaritas, chips and salsa, and guacamole! Great atmosphere and staff is nice most of the time! 4/5 for price and staff could be just a little bit more attentive. Also their side veggies could be dressed up a little with added flavor."}
{"text":"Great experience here last night .... My mom was visiting and dying for some authentic nachos and we picked the best place for just that !! Great food great drinks and awesome service even late night when I'm sure everyone was dying to close up shop and head out for the night :) thanks for wrapping up my moms experience in AZ so perfectly"}
{"text":"The monster nachos are pretty damn good. Split between three of us, myself and my children, still had leftovers. Clean and the outside patio is the best place to sit if the weather is nice. Tucked away in the corner its deceptive from first glance.  I'm a  native Texan from Dallas 
and I personally have not found any legit Mexican food places. Not in Scottsdale anyway.  Jalpenos is a  good fit for  the family. They cater to  young children and adults with a palate for good food."}
{"text":"Car club met at Jalapeno Inferno for lunch today. I am fan ! There was about a dozen of us and the staff did an excellent job taking care of us. Everyone received water, iced tea or whatever they ordered in record time. A good size restaurant, with ample seating both outside and inside, parking is no problem. We ordered from the lunch menu which offered  a selection from the main menu. I had the build your own chimichanga, consisting of shredded chicken, guacamole, peppers and onions. It was just the right size and very tasty, especially when I covered it with the hot salsa provided for chip dipping. Other diners had a variety of dishes and everyone seemed happy...and we all left full and ready for a nap. We even got a nice surprise, several of the couples got their check and it only had one item.  Seems like on Wednesday for the summer it is buy one get one free....an added bonus and incentive to get there soon. Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Service was great! The chips and salsa was excellent and My dinner was delicious no complaints about this place!"}
{"text":"Disappointed to say the least. I show up with my service dog (slash) to be greeted by the manager on the patio to be told that they don't allow dogs on the patio I then stated again it's my service dog she then gave attitude and walked away in disbelief. The food was at best 2 stars its Mexican! How well can u do refried beans n cheese? The bartender was very nice and seem to apologize for the managers attitude. I get it, rules have to followed but make sure you know the rules first. Another non present owner paying young kids to be manage his or her business. Sad to say won't recommend or be back, thanks though for the heads up."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a late Sunday lunch.  I had the lobster street tacos and my wife had the shrimp tacos.  Both were good, but I think the shrimp tacos had better seasoning (yes, I tried one of those too :)

Cold beer.  Reasonably priced.  Big portions.  Both lunches came with generous portions of rice and beans.  A bit too much for lunch, but good tasting."}
{"text":"Over all I liked everything. 

As for starters... the chips and salsa were excellent. The chips where very good... ne was like your standard nacho chips but the others mixed in where very different.They were flakey and light...  jet really good.

The \"black cherry\" Sangria (i order it non-frozen) was amazing...   really good and garnished with frozen cherries which was a nice touch.

Main dishes where very good. We ordered a wise array of dishes and everyone was happy with what was served. I ordered fajitas which were very good and had a nice sauce.

Over al everything was fresh and good quality. 

Service was slow... but we were there at lunch and a few larger parties were there so understandable. But a few points of waiting was a bit long of a wait to get drinks and some other things which took the experience down a notch.


If it wasn't for the poor service issue I would give a 4 Star rating.. but unfortunately I took it down to a 3."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a new Mex place and decided to give this one a try. We both had enchilada dishes. She had green sauce and I had the red. The food was pretty good. I wouldn't drive across town to eat here but it was decent. The service was good and atmosphere was pleasant."}
{"text":"I've given a review before and I've had to re-visit it and downgrade for the following reasons:

I went on a Sunday evening, early and went into the bar area.  Usually I will be happy to sit at the bar, however, since there were at least 6-8 high top tables available, I decided to sit at one.  
The hostess, if that's what you would call here in a bar, was nice, however, that's where it ended. 

The waitress asked me if I wanted a drink and as I was reaching for the menu she said the \"special was the Chambord one, did I want it\".....not a rousing endorsement, however I did order one.  It's not that good by the way, change the special. 
I ordered the Anaheim chile rellanos and since I didn't upgrade (really, I like a really good one just plain I guess) 
The chips and salsa, which are typically a half/half mixture of corn and flour were 95% corn, and no better than I could get in a better bag of tortillas. On a golf d note, the salsa was good. 
The chilis came out, and it seemed like they have plates of rice and beans sitting on a heated area (plate beyond hot) and then put the entree on it. The rice was drt and the beans looked like they had been sitting there too long also.  
The waitress did kind of ask me if everything was okay, on her way by.....really, is it that hard to be nice?
When I did not order a second drink, and the room was still not more than half full, the bill was kind of dropped off, not even with the usual \"take your time\".  I paid with a $50 bill and I guess she assumed what the tip would be.  Poor service does that.  She was lucky I had a $5 to use, although it wasn't earned. 
I did leave a 20% tip as I know food servers don't make too much and I sincerely hope she has to split with the other runners who at least were nice bringing chips and water. 
I'll probably not tell others to go there for \"great food\", it wasn't as good as normal for the last two visits.....it's become just another place to go. I'm out looking for another great place for Mexican/Southwest food.  Too bad, a few years ago it was great."}
{"text":"Not super cheap...
Parking lot sucks...
Never had anything bad there but portion wise...I guess I have expected more at times for the menu price.
Tasty food and quick, friendly and attentive service...always good if you want a quick but tasty meal.
Lobster tacos...Golden."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in North Scottsdale. Love their shredded beef burro enchilada style with red sauce."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me knows that one of my true loves is Mexican food.  That being said this is my favorite Mexican Restaurant in Arizona.  On my birthday they took me.  It was awesome.  They had a balloon guy making balloons for the kids and he made me a birthday hat.  Which is above and beyond what I would expect.  

Bottom line is the food is always great.  My favorite thing is the shrimp tacos.  And in general for what ever reason I always enjoy my time.  It's just a cool cantina. 

Wish I was there right now.  Maybe if I'm lucky I'll get there this weekend.  I hope if you love Mexican food you will give this place a try.  I see it has 3.5 stars which kills me because it's much better than that."}
{"text":"Food was mediocore and service was slow.

I'm new to the area and am very eager to try all the restaurants in my neighborhood as I  LOVE eating locally. This place was recommended by friends who joined us for dinner. It was a Friday night and the place was filled. It appeared to be decently staffed, but we found a few staff members standing around (bus staff?). We ordered an assortment of appetizers and drinks and waited, and waited, and waited. I'm willing to wait for food to be freshly prepared but I don't think it should take over twenty minutes to get a drink. The food was not bad, it just wasn't anything special that would make me think I had to come back any time soon.   We also waited a ridiculous amount of time for our table to be cleared, as the bus staff that was standing around never approached our table.  Instead, the very busy waitress who hardly had time for us, had to clean up our table prior to more food being delivered.  With so many restaurants in  my neighborhood to still try, this one will be put on the back burner for now."}
{"text":"BE CAREFUL!!! Hot plates will burn your fingers!!! Burnt my finger from the RIDICULOUSLY HOT plate in front of the manager, and he didn't apologize or offer to MIVE the plate for me!"}
{"text":"Chips are amazing and their salsa is BOMB! We love their hotter salsa and also order the hatch chili sauce for an additional kick! We love everything they offer and we make the 72 mile round trip at least twice a month because we refuse to go elsewhere for Mexican food! Being from California I've had the best of the best Mexican food there is to offer and nothing else in the valley even compares to Jalapeño Inferno! If you're looking for a sign, here it is. Go give this place a try! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Now that I have been here, I went back and read some of the negative reviews, and this place has caused me to adopt a new practice - read bad reviews first!! This place a common thread of rude waiters that disappear and being very dirty (some fun stories there about the owner too, although we apparently lucked out by not crossing his path).  Our experience was not much different......

 I will start with saying the food was pretty good, and although I didn't drink, the rest of my group (6 of us) enjoyed their drinks as well.  The restaurant has a nice feel to it, and looked like they had pretty good business.  Unfortunately, that is where the positive ends.  In the middle of our table was a condiment plate, and a stack of small plates (for chips and salsa).  We had to send the entire stack back, as EVERY single plate was dirty.  As we unraveled our silverware, we had to send two sets of those back as well for being dirty! YUCK!!  We waited quite a bit to order, but we were in good conversation, and I could say the waiter showed good tact in letting us talk and we snuck in an appetizer order and our entree order a few minutes later.  The food came out fast...in fact, so fast, that the appetizers came out with the meal.  Not only is that terrible service, but we literally could not fit everything on the table and had to give up things we were still working on just to make room, and maneuvering around everything made the appetizers nearly impossible to get to, and they went virtually untouched.  We made comments to the waiter hinting that the timing was bad and we would like to enjoy our appetizers, and his only response was \"yeah, that one does take a little longer.\" REALLY?! Do your job and control your food order!!!  The manager helped bring out the last of the food, and I finally mentioned everything that had gone wrong so far.  She apologized for the experience and admitted that there is simply no excuse for so much being dirty and said she would \"do something on our bill to compensate for the inconvenience\" (she took off the appetizers we barely had a chance to touch).  After we made a complaint, our waiter was virtually non-existent and we were asking for things (like drinks) multiple times till we got them. 

Final Scores
Food - B
Drinks - B (two people got same drink tasted totally different both enjoyed though)
Service - F
Cleanliness - F
Management - D
Hostesses - A (showed up 30 minutes early to reservation and were sat immediately) Their phone etiquette was great.

Sorry in my book, terrible service and dirty dishes are reasons to leave and never come back, I don't care about comped items, but we were pretty much neglected by the manager and the server the rest of the night...that is the complete opposite of how you should treat a customer with that kind of experience...cause guess what?? THEY GO TO YELP AND SHARE IT WITH THE WORLD!!!!"}
{"text":"It was a pretty basic, average Mexican bistro. It is good for a large group, we were well accommodate for a party of 10. The fajitas were great. Unfortunately, the waitress began by selling us a 'special sale' pitcher of margaritas that was completely watered or juiced down. It had very little tequila in it, which is obvious in a margarita on the rocks. That was pretty dissappointing.. The food was fine.....Guac was good...Other then that pretty average."}
{"text":"I spent $34.00 for pick up..two lunches. I paid extra for a dinner size of rice & beans. What I got were portions for an infant. This is not the first time, but is the last. The food is not bad but was cold..like really cold. No plates, forks or napkins and every thing is wrapped in tin so I couldn't microwave. Plate would help. Im not going here anymore. Very $$$$$"}
{"text":"Based on dining here for the first time and having lunch, this place earned a 4-star rating. My date had chicken fajitas and I had a cobb salad - both verv good. The margaritas were excellent. They were half-price, but I would have paid full price.

We shall return for more."}
{"text":"The service is never good but this time we waited 20 minutes for a drink order and 1 1/2 hours for our food.  Chili Rellenos burnt, Torilla Soup a pasty mush and the tacos had no flavor.  The owner was rude and when we asked when we would get our food she said \"That they are very busy and we would just have to wait\"!!  If the owner says that there is no one else to go to for help.  It was a terrible evening.  I am a local and know all the restaurants in the area.  Try somewhere else!"}
{"text":"The 10-year-old Mexican food restaurant has a huge patio,  and the inside was bright, warm and welcoming. I was really impressed with the cheerful service throughout the night, and I always felt taken care of.

The spot has a large margarita selection, and I tried a couple different varieties. The first I had was the Mojitorita, , which tasted more mojito-like than margarita-like, and I loved it because it still had an extra kick to it.

I also ordered the Pinnacle Peak Pomegranate margarita. I definitely tasted a ton of pomegranate flavor, and both drinks weren't overpowering.

As for the meal, I thought it was interesting the restaurant served two types of chips-thin and thick. The salsa wasn't as hot as the eatery's name might imply-it was a good medium heat.

My pal and I tried a vegetarian tamale, which I've never had before, and it had a nice fluffy consistency and was smothered in cheese. I am now a huge tamale fan!

I ordered a bean and cheese chimichanga ($11.99), which was so ooey-gooey good. It was a generous portion, but it was so tasty that I finished the whole thing.

Even though it was sort of a hike for me, I'd definitely go back to Jalapeño Inferno for their tasty eats."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have only been for lunch and happy hour, so I can't comment on the dinner menu at all, but for lunch it rocks. Service is always fast and good, food is excellent, happy hour menu rocks with a varied selection of margaritas that are all yummy. The apps are half off at happy hour also, so you can actually have a nice \"meal\" if you want. The patio is nice and sometimes they have live music. It's kind of hidden in a strip mall, so if you don't know where it is, you could miss it. This is not a typical strip mall place, though, it's very nice inside. Also, check for specials with Yelp- they offer some great deals!"}
{"text":"Every time I go here I am more  than pleased with their food and service. This past week my husband and I went to dinner and mentioned that it was our anniversary at the hostess desk, when our waitress came over to take our order she told us that her manager requested that dessert would be on them in \"celebration\" of our anniversary. It was a wonderful night and another wonderful experience there!"}
{"text":"The Pollo Fundido is really delicious and the proportions are huge so if you can't finish it they'll box it up in an oven ready box and the leftovers are just as good as they were at the restaurant! Good atmosphere and friendly staff, if I lived in north Scottsdale I'd definitely come in more often!"}
{"text":"They have the best chimichangas I have ever tasted! Great customer service and awesome chips and salsa"}
{"text":"They have two locations in North Scottsdale. One in D.C. Ranch Marketplace and this one. We like this one better for the food.
Since it was a great night out, we opted fir a high top in the outdoor bar section. Our hostess asked if we wanted a drink, so I asked her to get us some waters while I made my drink decision. She said she would be right back but that was the last we saw of her and of course, no waters. After a long wait, I flagged a server down and asked her to get a server. Finally, one shows up, with a bit of an attitude, as I heard the server tell our server that we had been waiting awhile, so instead of being nice, she's cranky. 
We finally get our drinks and order our food. I went with the Lobster Tacos. Chips and salsa finally showed up. Oh yeah, Yelpers- free guc when you check in on line!
The food is decent and usually the service is much better, but based on my experience that night, two stars."}
{"text":"Overall a vey mediocre place . The food was really not very good. I had the street tacos , and they were just ok, which is sad. Their margarita was way too sweet.  The service  was odd as well. It seems like 1st grade math isn't really something they are good at."}
{"text":"Fair... they charge you $1  if you ask for a jalapeño . None of the plates come with them which is weird. The service is good , but my order was wrong and the twist on sweet and hot just didn't work for us."}
{"text":"Started with the guacamole which was excellent. Especially when paired with their house frozen margarita. For the entree I had the dual  chile rellenos with chicken including sides of rice and re fried beans that were very good also.

Great place to eat with very friendly waiters and manager.

Yelp check in scored me a free guacamole."}
{"text":"After a few days of stewing, I just keep getting hotter and hotter over the Easter Brunch my husband and I experienced. It is quite possible that this place hasn't done buffets before. We arrive 15 min prior to our reservations which were at 10am, and were told \"WERE NOT READY\" the hostess was shocked that were arrived on time. So ok we'll go walk around. Came back 10 min's later and was seated. Then once seated, our server walks up about 5 min's later. Gave her our drink orders and she pointed out where the buffet was and to go ahead. Got up to go and was stopped by a different server, which said the foods not out yet. Now a line is forming around the buffet table and in the bar at the omelet bar. 10 more min's go by and finally the food comes out. My husband and I go up, get our food and get back to our table only to be even more disappointed that the food is \"luke warm\" REALLY. The table next to us asked for HOT plates, which they put there food on to warm it up. Then the bill comes $22.00 pp, $5.00 for each drink that seemed to hold about 3 oz (small), but the kicker was, we were then changed a 19% service charge for the 2 of us, NOT a party of 6 or more! Will we ever go back? Absolutely NOT! Terrible service and food. Extremely disappointing especially for the area. Nothing upscale about this place."}
{"text":"There is nothing special here.  The atmosphere is fine but it really is just the typical American version of Mexican food without any flare.  I'm even struggling trying to figure out what to write.  My enchilada was goopy as were the beans and rice.  The chips and salsa were good but again not special.  

Therefore, come here for an average, boring Mexican dinner but don't expect anything unique, special or particularly tasty."}
{"text":"Jalapeño Inferno has changed their menu. The Texas stacked enchiladas and Enchiladas Del Mar that we loved are gone. Gone! Those were two big time favs. Why oh why... 

The hot salsa is still the same, at least. Don't forget to ask for it as they don't typically bring it out by default. And the margarita selection is choice. The Cadillac is my #1. But man ... The new menu is just not as good. And our daughter, who is a burger connoisseur, said that her burger didn't taste the same tonight, either. It did look kinda thinner and smaller. 

This has been our go-to Mexican joint for a long time now, but no one was feeling it tonight. We'll be back to see if this was just a fluke. But with our favorite dishes gone and/or altered, we'll also be searching around for a possible replacement."}
{"text":"Ah Jalapeno's.  I love this place.  The first time I came here was probably in 2000 or so.  Very little has changed since then.  All of my favorite menu items are always waiting for me.  The famous Green Corn Tamales are to die for, the Enchiladas are my comfort food, and no one makes a better chili relleno.  

The place is family run and you can tell.  All of the staff work as a team and they treat you as one of the family as well.  There's a sort of effusive happy wholesomeness of good company.  

Don't miss the delicious home made chips (especially the flour ones), but don't eat too many either otherwise you won't be able to finish your main!"}
{"text":"The food at Jalapeno Inferno is very tasty and very spicey.  Unfortunately, the service is often aloof and inattentive."}
{"text":"Have been coming here since I moved here 10 years ago! Jalapenos is a good go-to Mexican restaurant for me. Probably mostly because I live so close to it, but also because the food is pretty dang good as well.

In my years coming here I have never had any bad service experiences, it has always been good. The chips and salsa are the best thing Jalapenos has to offer, for sure. Those flour chips?! Incredible. The corn ones are good too. The flour ones win by far though, the texture of them is great.

I typically order either the Sonoran Grilled Quesadilla or the Vegetable Fajitas. They are both pretty good. This place has a big menu too, lots of options. Also I have been of legal drinking age for over two years now, and I have yet to go to a happy hour here? that has got to change!

The whole ambiance of the place is nice. I will keep on coming back!"}
{"text":"I was skittish at first.  Good Mexican food in North Scottsdale?  But YES it does exist!  Jalapeno Inferno is DA-BOMB!  Great food, great drinks, nice and clean, and service that makes you feel like you are family.  They have phenomenal outdoor seating that is great at night.  This place is always busy and there is a very good reason - they have found the formula for success and the customers appreciate that.  Go get your grub on!"}
{"text":"Good upscale Mexican with good service.

I came here for business lunch the other day and everything went smoothly. It's Mexican restaurant but the decor makes you feel upscale.

Service was excellent, people on business lunch could be demanding. We like to talk and not pay attention to menu or anything until when we need something, we want right away. They catered our wants very nicely here. My supplier wanted to eat hatch green. He was too busy talking, when a server came, he asked if they have hatch green. If he had took time to look at the menu, he would have known they have several hatch green dishes.

My food was good. I ordered Shrimp enchiladas and really liked the sauce.

They had yummy looking desert but we didn't have time to order. Hope to come back to try some of their desert next time"}
{"text":"We've been eating here for fifteen years!  Consistently great food, even the hamburgers are delicious! Owners Laura and Terry run this place very well, and the service is fantastic. They really care about your experience and it doesn't disappoint! My favs are the shrimp tacos and pollo soup, hubby loves the combination platters. And the best drink is their frozen margarita swirl that will really make you smile! Check them out for a delicious meal and the best salsa and chips in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Jalapeño Inferno is my absolute FAVORITE Mexican restaurant to dine at!! No matter what plate I get, I am astounded at the flavors and aromas.  I usually order the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, or the tortilla soup, and I always am satisfied with my choice. I have also had quite a few of their salads and yet again, I am always pleased. 

The owners are usually always present in the restaurant, and come up to my table and ask how my experience has been.  They are extremely personable and friendly, and it's nice to be able to talk to them and hear (first hand) what has been going on in their restaurant.  

I have brought numerous friends to this restaurant and each and every one of them have been extremely satisfied and always want to return here. I will continue going here for as long as I live here, and I am so excited to try the restaurant that they are opening in DC Ranch!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. We had fajitas and have no complaints. The carne asada was tender and flavorful. 

Our server Aaron was outstanding and has a great sense of humor and a very pleasant demeanor. 

Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"It was a perfect day to have lunch on the patio.  My server was super friendly and I enjoyed my combo plate with a chicken encilada and the corn tamale."}
{"text":"Best ever jalepeno margarita!  Order the Inferno if you like it hot and spicy. I always order these types of margaritas and am often disappointed. Not this time - not here!  I will be back just for this drink. But the food is always great, so come for the food too."}
{"text":"My family and I are vegetarian. We tried to order food only to find out that none of the traditional red or green sauces are vegetarian. We said ok and ordered whatever sauces they had that were vegetarian. My mother and I ordered rellenos. We were told 10 min later that they were out. I then tried to order tamales. I was told they were out of those too. By this point, I am frustrated and the waitress is trying to blame the cooks and the owner. I ended up with enchiladas because there was nothing else. We are not difficult vegetarians. This place made us feel like we were inconveniencing them. Terrible spot for service. Terrible spot for vegetarians. At the end of the meal, our check came and they charged us extra for the sauces we ordered to substitute for the non vegetarian sauces. The food was not good enough to even warrant an extra star. Stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for something more than salsa that is hack, composed of industrial base with a sprinkling of white onion, this is not your place.

I would argue that very little cooking at all goes on in the kitchen, outside of some proteins for tacos and fajitas.

But I digress, it comes down to the salsa for a joint like this and...well...it's awful."}
{"text":"Hands down, our favorite place! My husband and I come here about twice a month and my friends and I recently starting coming for Happy Hour too.  Delicious chips (flour and corn) and salsa as soon as you sit down (they keep them coming too).  The mango margarita is my drink of choice here.  We always get the corn tamales and shredded beef tacos, and sometimes the spinach enchiladas (get it with shredded chicken and ask for extra almonds)!  Everything is amazing and the portions are large.  Whenever we have guests visiting we make sure to come here.  The owners are great and always check to make sure everyone is happy.  We will continue to come here (and to Rhythm and Wine which they also own)."}
{"text":"Have tried it several times because it's close, but am always disappointed. Actually very bad. Service and staff very nice but you have to have good food and they don't. Jesse"}
{"text":"Much improvement over our earlier experience at the Pinnacle Peak location. The location at DC Ranch far exceeds the other. Still needs to get their act together regarding service and treating customers. However I will say it was an improvement and the food was pretty good. Great salsa."}
{"text":"It breaks my heart but this place is falling deeper into the do not go back section.  The food is almost always on point but the service is terrible!! So if you have a lot of time and patience for incompetent service staff, you will not be disappointed.  I hope the management reads this and maybe train their people a little (ok a lot) in the art of serving. I would hate to see this place fall down the hole that several other restaurants have fallen victim to."}
{"text":"After reading other people's reviews I wasn't sure what to expect.  I found the food to be fairly good.  The guacamole was great, their ceviche was a bit different than I am used to, but tasty.  My mom had lime shrimp tacos and was vey pleased, and my chimi was pretty good.  Atmosphere was great too!"}
{"text":"Stopped in Jalapeno Inferno again yesterday for a quick happy hour and was quite pleased with our server. I must say Adrienne (sp?) was the best server we've ever had there. She was friendly, polite, and very prompt. We didn't have to wait for drink refills or our checks. She was on top of it all and I definitely felt the need to update my previous review. Maybe Adrienne is a sign of improved service. =)

I still don't quite feel the need to up my 3-star rating though. The food is decent and I love the happy hour prices, but this place just doesn't have anything exciting about it. It's a good spot for happy hour because it's close to work, but I wouldn't make a special trip up there. 

Thanks for the great service, Adrienne!"}
{"text":"Love this place or used to! Took my friend to the location off Pinnacle Peak today. I only had a second to sit my baby's carseat down when we noticed a baby roach on the wall. We quickly moved to the booth across the isle when I see another baby roach climb under the entry curtain. We quickly left, me embarrassed having taken my friend there. We won't be back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"I ordered the mahi tacos and shrimp enchiladas and the tacos only had 4 small sizes of fish, same as echiladas. Everything was super salty.
Chips were terrible, even my kid didn't eat them. 
I won't go back to this place again"}
{"text":"Two words of wisdom for you, and I hesitate to write this because it's going to make this place busy...

TACO TUESDAY.  For $10 you get unlimited refills (2 at a time) of chicken or beef tacos, soft or hard shell.

The drinks were strong and the staff is EXCELLENT.  They actually care, which seems funny to even have to mention that.  The manager even came over.

Watched one of the world series games here and it was a great experience all the way around.  It was clean, quiet enough, great food, great service, and what else could you ask for?

I didn't go during a football game on Sunday, but they have a sign that makes me want to.  all kinds of specials and special items.

Go check this place out of you are anywhere close!"}
{"text":"Great crunchy, homemade chips and salsa for starters! The green mole enchiladas with corn-WOW. To die for! This was my first time but the great, attentive service and tasty food was wonderful! Can't wait to go back and try some more their really tasty, fresh food!"}
{"text":"Wow! Great food and atmosphere! Had the spinach enchiladas with chicken! Soo good! Everything tasted very fresh and authentic. Have eaten here 2 times in 2 weeks and will defiantly return!"}
{"text":"As others have noted in recent visits, service had gone ridiculously downhill in the last year. Our last 3 visits to this location have caused us to never return, despite the good food.

I reached out directly to the owner as their website asks you to send feedback directly to her before I left a public review; I did so, never heard back over a month now. Guess they only want positive feedback?

Horrible service, bartenders more interested in talking endlessly to 'regulars' about personal affairs rather than helping OTHER regulars wanting their drinks/food.  Used to be a good environment but managers/owners that don't care will not allow this business to flourish much longer, IMO.  

The other location is good, food is always good and service is friendly and in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"I bought a localdines certificate after reading all the positive reviews, but in the end it wasn't as good as I was expecting.  There was nothing wrong with it, it just seemed like standard Mexican food.  If you tell them it's your first time there, they do bring you a complimentary green chili tamale appetizer, which was yummy.  I also liked the mix of corn and flour tortilla chips that come with the salsa (complimentary).  I had the spinach enchiladas and they were good, but I've had equally good ones at Serrano's and Carlos O'Briens.  The BF had the steak street tacos, and he said they were good.  Service was good...no complaints.  If we were in the area, I might try it again, but considering we live in south Gilbert, it's kind of a hike for average Mexican fare."}
{"text":"After my family & I have patronized this place for years I can say I'm done and won't be back. Wouldn't honor a gift certificate that was expired by a couple weeks but saying did.honor until a week ago like that was a consolation to us. The quality has declined so much in recent years that it's not even the same restaurant & seems consistent with reviews and SERIOUS lack of patrons. Not one table non bar area at 6pm.  
... USED to be good...oh well live & learn. Bad business as my mom would use for catering twice a year I said if she orders from here again  I'll get drive thru. Same quality."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and chips and salsa. We would recommend their food. Check in on yelp and get 10% off."}
{"text":"This was such an awesome amazing surprise!!! WE LOVED IT!!!!  My kids and I finally got to try Jalapeño Inferno.  The food was delicious!!! Our waitress Samantha was excellent, fast, and had a big smile.  The Mexican-style Calamari was crispy and just a little spicy with candied Jalapeños with a cooling chipotle ranch sauce.  The green corn tamale- tender, spicy and sweet- and an excellent cheese enchilada were my/my oldest favorites. My 9-year-old loved his favorite bean and cheese burrito with rice.  The chips were half flour tortilla chips, half corn... Piping hot with excellent salsa.  Even the managers were constantly roaming the floors to make sure everything was just right.  Amazing!  WE WILL BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Jalepeno Inferno with a group of 7 of my co workers. I have not had good experiences the last 3 times but I went because that is wjere the girls wanted to go. The service was terrible and tje food was worse! Several of us got the most expensive item on the menu...the surf & turf fajita. Disappointing is an understatement.... beef was over cooked and there was just a couple shrimps and very little lobster in the surf part. It was almost all mango pico de gallo. I will not be going back. Terrible food....terrible service"}
{"text":"One of the better places I've found for Mexican in the Valley. Now there are a few more I need to try, but for now Jalapeno Inferno is at the top of my list.

We went to Jalapeno during the Dining Out for Life Event (hats off to them for participating) and it was very busy. Maybe it's because of their location, I'm hoping it was because of Dining Out for Life.

The food (sorry, can't remember what we had) was prepared to perfection, not overly greasy like some places and the margarita I had tasted great. Maybe the margaritas are why I can't remember what I ate?"}
{"text":"One of our absolute favorite Mexican restaurants in Arizona,  and we drive from Tempe.  Everything is delish,  especially the pollo fundido."}
{"text":"Thanks to Groupon we found this place.  It's a nice Mexican joint in North Scottsdale.  Tucked away in the corner of the shopping center, there's no way I could've found it on my own.

After browsing the menu, I ordered:
Queso Crisp, $5
Monster Nachos, $10

The Queso Crisp was pretty good.  Kind of hard to screw up a Cheese Crisp, so I wasn't expecting anything less than good.  The Monster Nachos was very good.  I am a self-proclaimed Nacho-lover...and I'm a fan of their Nachos!

The service was so/so on the night we went...they were packed, so it was understandable.  Overall, pretty good experience.

**TIP** - the parking lot can get crazy packed on weekends, so park in the first spot you find.

Return Factor - 95%"}
{"text":"LOVE the puffy chips you get with salsa.... i get their chips and salsa for parties and everyone just loves them. their chimichanga is delicious and im glad they have a lunch size since its just huge for the regular sized one. Great food and service."}
{"text":"VERY RELIABLE AND CONSISTENT MEXICAN FOOD.

The true highlight is actually free; the house made flour chips.  Ask for the green salsa and if it's September ask for the Hatch green chile salsa.

Chimichangas are flavorful and shareable.  Here too get them smothered in the green salsa and have them put the retried beans inside.

For North Scottsdale, this place is a hit.  It is second place to The Mission in Old Town and even Ajo Als but I predict success by location alone.

The only \"CON\" I feel warrants a comment is the very dark and sleepy feel of the decor.  When I think Mexican, I envision fun.  A restaurant with few windows and dark walls pips that image upon entry.  But hey, isn't that what the bat is for?"}
{"text":"Love this place - the corn & flour chips along with amazing salsa are worth coming back for. And I can't get enough of their lobster street tacos. It's really nice to sit out on the patio and enjoy a beautiful Arizona evening while enjoying great food!"}
{"text":"I live nearby and they always seem busy so we ordered to-go one night to try it out.  They have curbside pickup which is nice considering it being a Friday night and parking is a nightmare there.  The website had a variety of meals but I tried a known meal in all mexican restaurant, the Fundido.  First disappointment, they told me 20 minutes.  I got there 20 minutes later and waited maybe almost 10 minutes until I called to tell them that I was waiting outside.  I could've just walked in but there was a crowd already standing/waiting at the door to get in.  Once I told them I was there, she came right out with my ticket.  She went right in and came right out with my food -- so it was probably been sitting there the whole time.  I went home, which is only 2 minutes away and the food was not even warm.  The cream cheese on the fundido was thick and had hardened.  They made the fundido way too fancy with loads of white onions and green bell peppers inside.  I also ordered a kid burger and the meat patty is the size of McDonalds cheeseburgers in a jumbo hamburger bun. The chips are a nice change but I really didn't like the big chunks of white and green onions in the salsa.  Maybe the service is different inside but this place is nothing to buzz about.  If you're looking for a sit down or a place to spend a few hours eating and mingling then this is the place but if you want a more decent mexcan meal, I'd rather go to Someburros down the street - much better."}
{"text":"Dunno why people are saying what they are, this place is good. Server was kind, brought us a free sampler since it was our first time. Worth getting again. The spinach and almond enchilada was killer. I'd def get that again. The nachos and fajitas looked awesome too, tho I didn't try em."}
{"text":"I hardly go to Mexican restaurants, I am a hard critic. Usually I can make it or make it better!
I am very pleasantly surprised, overall the food was really good and the service even better. I had the corn tamales (gave up meat for lent) and hardly miss my meat. 
The chips were a great treat, first place I have ever gone to that has flour chips ( reminded me of my grandmother) and corn chips as well...the setting was very pleasant, patio dinning with great people.
Need to come back for a meat dish!"}
{"text":"The Tamales were absolutely amazing!! Love the atmosphere! Great for Happy Hour or just to hang out on the patio & have their yummy nachos!"}
{"text":"Mexican food for commercialized Americans, but it does a fairly decent job at that."}
{"text":"Just okay mexican food. Very gringo.

The chips and salsa were very good.  The rest of food was okay.  We thought the food came out WAY TOO FAST.  Which is sign of previously prepared food that is just \"warmed up\".

We tried the lobster street tacos.  I could not taste the \"lobster\".  So, i wasnt sure if it was lobster.  It is NOT MAINE Lobster.  My dining partner had the shrimp fajitas and it was pretty good.

The service was fast and friendly.  Although it seemed like they had too many people that it felt like we were rushed.  People going left and right.  Zooming by you.  Not a very relaxed atmosphere.

This place seems to the next \"IT\" in Scottsdale.  I dont understand why this place is packed with people.  The food is just okay.  I have had better mexican food."}
{"text":"Excellent service by a super sweet and genuine young lady name Samantha. Not only was Samantha our waitress outstanding at customer service, but also knowledgable with the menu items which was very freshening! We ordered the sweet tamale appetizers. OMG a must have! Award winning for good reason! 
The chicken fajitas loaded, fresh & very flavorful! 
The table chips are a mix basket of flour, and corn tortilla chips with a very addicting salsa!!! Super GOOD & reasonably priced.nestled between Safeway grocery store & Lerenos pizzeria."}
{"text":"The food is so sucky!!!!! Good chips that's all not even the salsa was good. I was truly disappointed and hope to never go here again

The service was bad.and she only checked on us when we ordered and when the foodcame even though we needed refills in between that time.  The food was burnt and just a sad excuse for Mexican food, think of other places when craving a Mexican night out."}
{"text":"By far one of the best restaurants in Scottsdale. The espanaca dip, tamale, sea of cortez fajitas, and even their burger are all delicious. If you like spicy order the inferno sauce, but beware, that sauce is not for the faint of heart."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant.  We have been going here for years.  Not once have we had a bad experience.  The food is ALWAYS terrific.  The service is fantastic even during the crazy winter season.  Any bad review you see is beyond my comprehension.  Hundreds of visits here for us have been fantastic.  Best Mexican food in Scottsdale! Thank you for being so fantastic!"}
{"text":"Officially DONE with this place. The service that we got tonight (and the past couple of visits) was the worst service I've ever received at a restaurant. Samantha was our waitress in the cantina area (or at least that was the name on our receipt). 

We came in for dinner. It was Taco Tuesday which we didn't realize before coming in. We saw the deals on top shelf margs so we both ordered those. They were delicious. Now starts the nightmare. 

We ordered queso and when it was delivered, we had no chips left. Our waitress Samantha was no where to be found for about 15 min following that. We had to actually flag down a manger to ask for more chips and to ask them to reheat our queso which was now crusty. 

I ordered the all you can eat and tacos and my boyfriend ordered the fundido. Our waitress came back after our queso was gone and said \"remind me of your orders? The kitchen can't find your ticket and I can't find it in our system\". AKA she forgot to put it in and blamed the poor kitchen staff.   We reminded her and asked for more salsa, which we never got. She also asked if we wanted another round of margs, to which I said yes please. The margs never came. 

Our food finally came out about 5 minutes later and our waitress said \"can I get you another round of margaritas?\" ARE YOU JOKING? I swear I was laughing at this point. She had literally just asked us! 

As always, the food was delicious. The kitchen staff kills it. But the service is horrible. Even after having to ask a manager to reheat our queso, we didn't even get an apology. This used to be my go-to place for YEARS and now I just leave angry. I can no longer give this business my money. And you shouldn't either."}
{"text":"I went into jalapeño inferno for the first time ever. It was absolutely to die for and to make matters even better we had an amazing server, I believe her name was Shannon! I ordered the lite poblano and my husband ordered the surf and turf fajitas! On top of the delicious food and service we had some yummy margaritas that Shannon recommended. I had ordered the boss which is their skinny, I'd definitely come back just for that, and my husband ordered an ice cold Amber on draft! If you are ever in the area come on down! super friendly environment!"}
{"text":"Plain and simple:  if you want run of the mill Mexican & margaritas and live North of the 101 between Pima and Tatum, this place is an option.  If you order anything with shrimp, make sure you tell them to be generous or you'll be sending your plate back for more of 'em."}
{"text":"We love this place. Three words; flavor flavor flavor. We just left and we are more than satisfied and miserably full, and all we had was chips and salsa and shared two appetizers?

The place was packed when we got there but even still we quickly got a great table.

Even though they are under construction we still received our drinks and food well prepared and in short order.

The owner Terry came by each table and checked on the service and said hello to everyone. The entire staff from the hostess the wait staff(our waitress was Taylor) the bartenders to the busboys were exceptionally attentive and professional.

When you go you have to try the Smoked Pork Hatch Chili Quesadilla."}
{"text":"They are consistent and delicious. Definitely ask for the hot salsa, much better than the house salsa. Best Mexican north of the 101 and south of Cave Creek highway."}
{"text":"Place is very nice. A lot of tvs! 

Coldest beer this side of the Alamo. Also lots of tvs!"}
{"text":"First time! We shared fajitas for two. Yumm! We sat outside and enjoyed the open atmosphere. Service with a smile and nicely paced.  I have breakfast 5p0 yards away and never eve noticed this lil neighborhood gem. Fair selection of tequila's including Extra Anejo. 

Well be back!"}
{"text":"Yet another great experience at Jalapeno Inferno today. Came in around 4:30, right before the Sunday dinner rush. Service was great, our waitress was friendly and attentive. We were promptly served delicious flour tortilla chips which are dangerously good. Tonight I ordered the blood orange margarita which was tart and delicious.

I had a sampler platter tonight which included a corn tamale, mini fundido's, a green chile quesadilla and queso w/ spinach. Everything was absolutely delicious. I ate way too much because it was oh so good! My fiance had the queso skillet chicken which was amazing as usual. The ambiance is also really nice here and it was a beautiful day to have the patio open with a nice breeze.

Overall I am very impressed with Jalapeno Inferno. I will be back to try more!

(Going to try the lobster taco's on the next visit)"}
{"text":"At the time I ventured here there was the Yelp mention special and get a free lunch item, can't complain on that one :-D

But, the service was pretty dismal.  We were there for two hours!!! For lunch!  And, not busy either...

The food...Carne Asada Fajitas.  They were okay, lots of liquid in the bottom :-/

I won't make a specific special trip back here, but if I'm in that shopping center, I'll check it out again."}
{"text":"Understaffed and horrible drinks/food...never seen a bartender behind bar???? Really? The manger had to make the drinks and clearly he has never made drinks YUCK!!!!!! I had a cheese enchilada and rice....can you say salty??? Save your money.."}
{"text":"Good food, good service and good atmosphere...  Just tastes like American-Mexican food, so couldn't give a 5th star."}
{"text":"Because I couldn't get anyone to pick up the phone for my \"to go\" order, I decided to simply go there, order, and wait. What an excellent idea! I had the most delicious Pomegranate Margarita...I had to have TWO!
Food never seems to be quite as good taking it home, rather than having it at the restaurant. But it's a pretty good 2nd. 
We live close by, so this is typically our go to Mexican restaurant. 
One of the best things they have: their tortilla chips. Flaky, crunchy and perfect!
I will continue to return!"}
{"text":"It's a good place. Not a big fan of their lunch fajitas, as they were not hot and sizzling like most.  They chicken and rice soup is among the best I've had and order it everytime I go there.  They also have excellent chips and salsa.  I have tried various combo plates and they are quite good. Will go back and update my review upon at that time."}
{"text":"We come here a lot, but lately (past couple of months) the wait staff and bartenders in particular have a really crappy attitude.  They don't smile, don't act friendly and generally have a I don't give a s--t demeanor.  Fix it or I'll find somewhere better to frequent."}
{"text":"May 5, Cinco de Mayo, we decided to go to our favorite spot for my Birthday dinner.  Have gone on Cinco de Mayo before, with larger parties .   This time there was only 4 of us!

We arrived early, 5:20, reservations were at 6:00.   They seated us anyway, in a corner ..it was 6:00 before they plopped the complimentary nachos on the table... No water, No drinks, no napkins, no waiter.....
6:15 we finally ordered our pitcher of house margaritas, thinking that would be easier seeing how busy they were.   That order didn't arrive till 6:45, along with dirty glasses!   Waited again for 20 
minutes  for one clean glass....when they brought that... We thought, let's order another pitcher and food, because we rarely saw our waiter.   Who seemed to be a little frantic!   
At 7:20 we finally received our food ...we asked for our bill, because if the wait history...just wanted out of there!!!   Happy Birthday to me!!!

I made a point to tell the hostess when we left, how bad the service was... Not just the waiter....the whole process!   Her comment.. Well, it is Cinco De Mayo!!!
Hello...this was my fourth Cinco da Mayo dinner here and NEVER had service like this... The waiter took the pitchers off our bill... But my birthday was already ruined!
I will never go back !"}
{"text":"Family favorite. Always great food. The most consistent Mexican resturant in the area.. Good staff. Friendly & personable. Luv the Tex Az marg. By far the best marg in north Sct."}
{"text":"i blatantly saw a hostess eat a customers food before giving it to them. so i obviously got up and left."}
{"text":"This is our \"Go To\" place for great Mexican food.  A local favorite, so it does get busy.  If you like hot, There are several meals that have Inferno sauce added.  Chips and salsa is great too."}
{"text":"This has quickly become a family fave, at least twice a month! If I don't take the kids for mini fundidos, I meet the girls for a margarita! The service is great, the food is great! We've had an adorable waitress, Paige, a few times & the kids beg for her now! She's so fun & always has a smile on her face!"}
{"text":"Food isn't bad. But I've gone 3 times to this location over the past 5 years. I've gotten sick all 3 times. I tried it again last night and Bathroom issues again for my both me and boyfriend. Never going to this location again."}
{"text":"This place is not an authentic restaurant but it's close to being one. My boyfriend and I ordered the fajitas for two. This came with carne asada and chicken. The steak was perfect. Now the chicken was a little undercooked. It came with two plates; guacamole, sour cream, beans & rice. The food came out nice and hot when served. The rice was hard and dry. Overall our experience was okay."}
{"text":"I was apprehensive about trying this place because of the reviews and also because I am super picky when it come to Mexican food but we really like the food here.

The chips and salsa were great. I loved the flour chips mixed in with the corn chips. The salsa was tasty but quite mild for a place called Jalapeno Inferno. Still good though!

I had a combo with the spinach enchilada and the chili relleno. Both were good but I especially liked the chili relleno and the spicy sauce on top of it. I will get just 2 rellenos next time instead of the enchilada. Rice and beans were great too.

Husband was dieting so he was really happy to see the selection of lite entrees. It is nice when restaurants have healthy choices other than salads. He had the tomatillo chicken which he said was really good and didn't leave him feeling deprived.

Service was great. Our server was nice and attentive. 

We will definitely be back. Their patio looks very nice and I would love to be sipping a margarita outside when the weather cools off!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I always want to go here. The flour chips are unbelievably good! We always have to ask for more flour ones. You eat the corn chips because you feel bad for them, but the flour is where it's at. I always have their Courtney's Favorite Spicy Chicken Burrito (something like that). It is spicy, and it is soooo good. So much flavor and heat! They also have an amazing prickly pear margherita. It goes down like dessert, but it can be dangerous."}
{"text":"Great chips and salsa (corn chips and flour chips).. the salsa is nice and roasted.  The queso is good (although I am more of a fan of the queso with charizo vs the spinach).  The burritos are huge and sharable.  I like the chicken better than the ground beef.  The service is better in the restaurant than the bar as the bartender is busy making drinks and catching up on the games vs serving people at the bar.... but it didn't really take away from the good food, so that will be a mulligan!  The desserts look great too, although I have always been so full that I don't order them!  Worth a trip for the good mexican food in a clean environment with plenty of TVs in the bar for a sportsfan.  The Happy Hour is good too!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and although it was busy we were seating quickly since we chose to eat outside.  The misters and fans made it comfortable.  The server was attentive and quick to return to check on us and take our order.  We enjoyed the sweet tamale appetizer, chicken fundido, steak and lobster tacos.  I can't say the lobster taco were the best thing I've ever eaten, but it was ok. The rice was a little too dry.  We loved our cookie sundaie and fried ice cream dessert.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We were a large group for lunch on a Tuesday and the server we had was wonderful.  He got everyone's order correct as well as getting out checks right (individual checks for 15 people).  

The food though was another story.  I had the spinach enchilada and green corn tamale on the lunch menu.  Well I guess upscale means you sprinkle slivered almonds on the enchilada (it was ok) however the tamale was not good at all.  I sliced into it and all there was was a roll of masa with a very, very  little green corn. Actually so little green corn that I had to search for it.

As stated the service was wonderful however the food certainly was not upscale.  Tried it and won't go back.  There are much better restaurants serving Mexican/American food in the area."}
{"text":"We went here for happy hour/dinner last night and had the best time!  We sat outside of the Cantina on the patio where they had plenty of heat lamps to keep you warm once the sun went down.  They offered some good drink specials and all appetizers were half off!  My boyfriend and I split a sampler appetizer and it was enough food to feed us both for dinner.  Everything I tried was delicious.  Plus they serve the best home-made chips in salsa .  Both were very good and it was a real treat.  The service was excellent and the manager came by to check on us also.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Co-worker really liked his steak/chicken fajitas. He received a large portion of both for $15. Guess I should have gotten them because I paid $20 for 5, yes 5, shrimp in my fajitas. The chips and queso were very good, though. The takeaway from here is don't get the shrimp fajitas unless you want to feel cheated. I'm guessing there's a better Mexican restaurant value somewhere nearby?"}
{"text":"In the mood for Mexican and somewhere different, we found a $30 for $15 gift certificate for Jalapeño Inferno on localdines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).  A great deal.  It made a meal for two half price.  Even better; It turns out this place is one of those great family owned strip mall restaurants that valley residents should be more aware of.

The setting:
We didn't eat in the dining room.  But from what I saw, it was quite spacious, and had a fairly formal setting for a causal family place.  The patio is big and if you sit farther back, you'll be on the other side of a pond setting between this restaurant and Jade Palace.  It's a nice touch.

The food:
The chips and salsa are awesome.  There are two types of chips in the basket.  One is a traditional tortilla chip; the other is very crispy, more like a wonton.  The salsa is pretty mild, but very flavorful.  A great way to start any meal.  Upon telling the server it was our first time here, he ordered us a free tamale.  It won best of Phoenix (I'm guessing in the new times) so they're pushing everyone to try it.  It's really good.  We also ordered the chicken and steak fajitas for two.  Delicious.  The steak had quite a kick to it, something very spicy in that rub.  Also props to Jalapeño Inferno for giving both plates a generous scoop of guacamole.  Most restaurants are really starting to cheap out on it.

Overall:
The service was great.  The food is excellent.  Jalapeño Inferno is a wonderful place to eat.  Get the localdine (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485) for a good deal, then enjoy a good meal!"}
{"text":"Loved the complimentary green chile tamale appetizer here!  I also adored the chicken enchilada with green chile cream sauce!!  I especially appreciated the fact that I was able to order this dish NOT fried.  Some venues refuse to alter their menu selections.  Understandable, since many chains strive to stay within national standards, but it's great to find establishments that gladly cater to their customers' wishes!

Even though our first, and only, visit was 3 or 4 years ago, I vividly recall it was a beautiful night, so Mom and I opted to dine in the patio.  It started to get chilly, but we did not want to move inside for the solo acoustic guitarist was delightful playing his Santana covers.  Thank goodness I always keep an extra jacket/sweater in the car for emergencies!

Thank you Jalapeno for a memorable night!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere, food, drinks, cleanliness and staff were top notch. I ordered the smothered chicken which was tender and very tasty....it also complimented my Kick-Ass Tex-Ass drink : )
A great place if you are craving Mexican."}
{"text":"Dined at the DC Ranch location with 2 guests in early May...great experience with very good food & excellent service.  Came back a few days later & it was like a different place.  Waited 45 minutes after ordering two non-complicated entrees.  I asked for Manager, who apologized for the long wait  & handed us our food to take home (he comped the meals, but truthfully, I would rather have dined in the restaurant).
  
Third visit a week later with hubby was definitely NOT the charm.  No Manager in sight (nor hostess), no attention for at least 10 minutes after sitting down, and server had a \"I could give a rat's butt\" attitude.  I specifically asked her about a particular entree as I don't like \"spicy\"... she assured me it was not.  HELLO...2 bites in, YEOW..hot, hot, hot.  She ignored me from the other side of the room, while I tried to get her attention (too busy gossiping with 2 other servers by the kitchen door!). I had to ask 3 times, 3 different employees, for some sour cream...to tamp down the heat from this \"mild\" entree!  By then, the food is cold anyway.

Finally, when our server showed back up to present the check (all smiley, because now it's \"tip time\") I indicated my essentially UNTOUCHED plateful of food and nicely said \"this isn't what you said it would be....it's very HOT, in fact, I could not eat it\". To my astonishment, she replies, \"Oh really?  No one's ever complained before\", then grabbed the plate & left.  No \"sorry\", no \"may I get you something else?\", nada.  REALLY?  By the way, the restaurant was NOT busy, so no excuses! 

Hey Owners:  either start training your servers to earn their expected tips,  or you yourselves need to hang around & make sure they're doing their jobs!  This server was indifferent & incompetent.  Even my husband, who is pretty easy going, was flabbergasted & said \"I won't be back here anytime soon\". 

I"}
{"text":"The mahi-mahi tacos are so frickin good. Not to mention the delicious guacamole. Loved it, definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley! I would come here just for their chips and salsa- so good. :) This is by far the best location- the service is very efficient, employees are friendly and the food is exceptionally delicious. Out of all of the dishes I've ordered, my favorite are the steak fajitas and the Black and Bleu salad with steak. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for good quality Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Best chips and salsa in Scottsdale. 
Fabulous nachos!
Great margaritas- get 'The Boss\"
Smoky pork hatch quesadilla is amazing
Black and blue salad is wonderful

I personally do not like their chicken but I like shredded white meat cooked in a pressure cooker. They grill chicken great or do shredded chicken but not all white meat.
Wishing they would add the delicious smoky pork as an option and not just for the Smoky hatch quesadilla.

Staff is warm and friendly. 

A great place to take family and friends visiting Arizona."}
{"text":"my favorite Mexican place in north Scottsdale.  Cozy and good.  Been going there for years, especially like the street taco and the salsa.  My wife had the recently update fun-dido.  she is already talking about going back to get it again."}
{"text":"I was visiting family for the Thanksgiving holiday and my aunt and uncle wanted to take us out to their favorite Mexican restaurant, Jalapeno Inferno. The restaurant is very clean and on a Friday night, very busy! But that just means it's popular, which is a good sign. 

However, I expected better service. Our waitress didn't bring my uncle's 2nd beer; maybe she was new, but luckily we weren't charged for it. All the food tasted great, except my aunt received chicken instead of beef, and my cousin found an inedible object in her food.The manager promptly came by and apologized and comped the plate and gave us a free fried ice cream.

I'm not going to dock this place too much because the food and drinks were tasty. Unfortunate things happen on occasion, but if I ever come back and service lacks again I doubt I'd go a third time."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fast, friendly service with scrumptious Sonoran Mexican cuisine...this is a spicy jewel in N. Scottsdale.  I would go here for the chips and salsa alone!  They also have a very cozy little patio outside with a rolling creek that makes sipping the house margaritas even more enjoyable.  

Wondering what's yummy to eat here?  I'd say start with the mini fundidos. These beauties are mini eggrolls stuffed with cheese, chicken, and green chili goodness, drenched in a jalapeno cream cheese sauce.  Served up in a mini skillet these are a tasty way to start your dining experience.  

I've sampled a few of the dishes here, and if you are a fan of green chile, you will be very pleasantly surprised to see a variety of their dishes are made with Hatch green chile.  Growing up in New Mexico, I was very happy to see this on the menu!  When the menu says \"spicy\" they mean it!  Try the enchiladas, quesadillas, and the green corn tamales."}
{"text":"Stopped by for an early lunch today at 11:15. Nobody at the hostess station and it was several minutes before anyone acknowledged we were there. Our server didn't indicate there were any lunch specials nor ask if we had any questions. Once our order was placed the food arrived quite quickly which would have been fine had the food been prepared fresh. My wife ordered enchiladas which were barely warm in the middle so they obviously were pre-made and reheated. My machaca burro was fine. Ice tea was never refilled and, we weren't asked if we wanted dessert. I don't know if it was an off day for them but I'll probably not find out since one bad experience is all I'm willing to invest."}
{"text":"This place is good to go.   Came for lunch.  Ordered the Red Chile Beef Burro. Outstanding!. Service was good and timely.  The flour chips in the chips and salsa were excellent!  Try this spot out I wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"It was my first time at this restaurant.  I tried the Hatch Green Chile Enchiladas which had great flavor and spice. As a recommendation from
a yelp review I ordered the sangria and for dessert we had the fried ice cream.  I did enjoy the sangria very much and the service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"I really like their baja fish tacos. The wife and I have them frequently. It's not always consistent, but most of the time it is very good. Get the corn salsa (not sure the right name for it, but its yummy!)"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been regulars of this restaurant for years, and we absolutely love it! The food is consistently excellent! super fresh, perfectly cooked, and seasoned so well. The entire staff is wonderful as well, we truly feel like, and are treated like beloved family.  
Today we ordered a menu item from their 99 days of summer promotion. Today it was BBQ pulled pork that they were kind enough to make us some nachos with. It was a wonderful way to enjoy the main element of the dish. Next Saturday I'm going to order it the way it's naturally prepared for contrast. If you haven't been to this restaurant yet, try it as you'll be hooked as well."}
{"text":"Bad service.  Went for lunch on cinco de mayo.  Saw there were specials, prizes, balloons...but our waitress never mentionned any of the specials.  We found out only after placing our order.  We were offered a free tamale because it was our first visit.  They forgot to bring it out.  Got it when the meal was almost finished then they charged it on the bill.  The waitress barely came to our table so no way to refill drinks or get extra napkins.  Food was mediocre. I am dissapointed because judging by the crowds I've seen there I expected excellent food and excellent service, neither of which we got."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been on a quest for great
Nachos and Jalapeno Inferno's did NOT disappoint!! I also ordered \"The Inferno\"
Margarita and I was in nacho-margarita heaven !"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things about this place which is why I decided to come in for a birthday dinner with my girls. I didn't announce it was my birthday so I didn't expect anything special, but the waitress was a bit rude and was rushing us. The manager was polite and made up for it by telling us to take our time . The food was good not great. I ordered the tamale and it was just OK. The chips and salsa however for the greatest thing the chips and fresh and made in house, the rice and beans werent bad i guess . I also had an enchilada and again it was just OK."}
{"text":"This is our favorite \"standard tex mex\" food in Scottsdale.

Their fajitas are awesome, and we really love their chips and salsa and the Skillet Cheese appetizer, which is their rendition of Queso Fundido."}
{"text":"Just found this place about 3 years ago. Jalapeño inferno has quickly become one of our regular places to eat. Their chips and salsa are homemade and yummy. We like our salsa hot so we request the hot and mix with the regular. The shrimp and lobster fajitas are to die for. And to wash down this fiesta of flavor you can't go wrong with the Boss margarita!"}
{"text":"This is a really good standby for local Mexican food. We were seated promptly at a table outside and immediately received chips and salsa.  Our waitress informed us that today was National Marguerite Day and the house drink was only $3. Ole! The drink was plentiful and tasty. The house Cobb salad was a good surprise with fresh greens, bacon, eggs, avocado - all the fixings - and a generous serving. The second dish we ordered was a burrito with rice and beans. A side of guacamole was only $1.50. All in all, a nice dinner, even if not exceptional."}
{"text":"If you're feeling like \"Mexican\" this place is just ok. Yes just ok. Their homemade taco chips are definitely a winner and hard to put down. Salsa \"tasty\". 

I like the 2 or 3 combo option on the menu. Lots of items to choose from. I tried the shredded chicken and beef tacos (served with rice and refried beans). Shells were homemade but a little greasy. My husband went with the shrimp enchiladas ($13.99). Nothing special and expensive. 

The have a long list of margaritas including their \"Kick-Ass Tex-Ass\" topped with a shot of beer. During happy hour (3 to 6:30) most margaritas are $5.99. Although that may seem like a good deal don't be fooled because the glass is filled to the brim with ice. 

Overall kind of pricey for a Mexican restaurant and not all that impressed with the quality of the food. Let's take it up a notch here."}
{"text":"We went here with an awesome Groupon and our taste buds were rewarded.  The location is nice, they have plenty of seating and the staff is super-attentive.  I loved this place so much I went two weekends in a row.

The food highlights:  

Once you are seated they bring you an awesome bowl of chips, not only corn chips but flour tortilla chips too.  I've never had them before and they practically melt in your mouth.  Their hot salsa is unlike any other I have tried, and it is AMAZING!  It's not thin like most hot salsa and was a  wonderful orange color with spices mixed in.  I made sure to take home the leftovers because it was so good.  I couldn't stop thinking about it and had to go back the next weekend.  

We ordered the Skillet Cheese appetizer.  A little cast iron skillet filled with delicious white cheese, cut up peppers and chorizo sausage, long with 3 flour tortillas.  This was SOOOO good.  It went very well with the chips too.  A little spicy if you included cheese, peppers and sausage in one bite, not so much with just the cheese.  

I had a three item combo, crunchy beef taco, cheese enchilada and bean & cheese tostada.  All of the items were like most of the Mexican restaurants in town and were very good.  

This restaurant has some very unique items on the menu and we will be back again.  I can't wait for my next food adventure!"}
{"text":"Love the happy hour with all appetizers half price. They do run daily specials if you get set up on their email list. 
I love the shrimp cerviche, cheese crisp, appetizer platter and great margaritas. The Don is awesome, but not on happy hour. 
We like to dine outside and they have a large patio with a nice water feature running on the West side of patio with nice landscape."}
{"text":"Ordered food togo and was greeted by 4 young hostesses who were ready to take my order.  I had beef tacos in a hard shells with refried beans.  They always supply salsa and chips which are corn and flour mixed.  Their salsa is excellent with chunks of tomatoes and mild kick.  The tacos were awesome as usual.  Thank you for the quick service!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best around as far as Mexican. Food goes...perfectly priced ..not too cheap not too much..friendly and attentive staff...my only reason for no five star is it's a little salty"}
{"text":"On our quest to find fabulous Mexican cuisine we stopped in at Jalapeño Inferno after some research.  Waiter was great and we attentive.  We dined outside by the water feature which sounds like a babbling brook and created lovely ambiance for our outdoor dining.  Definitely recommend the patio if weather permits!  Chips were unique.  A combination of fried flour and corn tortillas.  First time for the flour and they were all tasty.  Salsa was good!  Chicken enchiladas has a fabulous tomatillo sauce that was flavorful.  Rice and beans were good.  Lobster, shrimp and carne asada fajitas were a tasty choice.  A good amount of each for $26 served with traditional accompaniments such as sour cream, guacamole that was thoroughly enjoyed, lettuce, shredded cheddar and flour tortillas. Carne asada had great flavor.  Lobster was tender.  I would've like some char on my shrimp, but it was good.  Fried ice cream was shared st the end of the meal and was traditional ( we requested without strawberry and chocolate sauces) fried ice cream which we enjoyed immensely.  Overall this was a very enjoyable outside dining experience!  We would return and recommend!"}
{"text":"Maybe I just don't prefer my Mexican food deep fried and smothered in yellow cheese, but I was pretty disappointed in Jalapeno Inferno. 

I had a Google Offer, so we ordered a few house margaritas, the appetizer sampler, and the hatch chili pork enchiladas. The appetizer sampler looked like it guaranteed gastrointestinal issues, but we dug in anyways. There was just a dollop of guacamole that did not appear to be freshly made. The bean dip and quesadilla were both bland. The cheese dip was tasty, but it was the smallest item on the plate. The rest of it I believe were mini tamales, burros, and fundidos, but they all looked and tasted basically the same. To put it succinctly, all of it lacked pizzazz. If this represented the best of their appetizer menu, then I would not recommend any of the appetizers.

The hatch green chili enchiladas, on the other hand, were pretty tasty. Good, spicy sauce and succulent shredded pork. I pulled all the melted cheese off (which came off in one perfectly congealed brick) my enchilada, and I think that made me better appreciate the sauce. The rice and beans that went with the enchilada were fine.

The house margaritas were predominantly mix, so they were entirely run of the mill.

We sat on the patio, which was nice, except for the occasional wafting of cigarette smoke. I'm from Ohio. There you can't smoke in restaurants period, not even on their patios. I miss that.

Speaking of Ohio, the Mexican food at Jalapeno Inferno was basically like the Mexican food at average joints in the Midwest: average and appealing to those with palates that crave the fried, bland, and unnecessarily cheesy. The hatch green chili dishes (which I could never find in Toledo, Ohio) were this place's saving grace.

All in all, not worth the drive to North-North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I LOVE their chips... 1/2 flour, 1/2 corn in a basket. I've always had very good meals but can be a little inconsistent- however, in many, many visits it's never been bad. And most of the year, the setting on the patio would compensate for any missteps.

This weekend we were there on a Saturday and had an incredible summer special!! $15 for a sampler platter and a flight of Margs! We often share the sampler app (usually $13) anyhow so to get the three little Margs for $2 was crazy! 

The black cherry sangria is delicious!! Although,  I've grown more in love with the sangria-Rita!!"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! It was highly recommended by the place that we were staying at. Bree was our server. I hope that your tip reflected how awesome you were. She made great recommendations and was very attentive. She kept us laughing. The food was great! We would definitely return if we go back to Arizona again."}
{"text":"This place was great. We were seated quickly. The chips and salsa were delicious. My wife raved about the tomatillo chicken enchiladas. I had the shredded beef tacos (my serving size was small, but after all the chips I had, that was probably a benefit.) The tacos were delicious. Everything tasted good and the margarita was well done as well. This is mexican food that will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Food was great and the margaritas are good. Some items are unique and some are your typical Mexican fare. Seems like a good neighborhood spot. Went there twice, once for lunch and once for dinner."}
{"text":"Can I give them 6 stars!!! This was far from my home but well worth the drive. Right now they are having specials for the hatch chili festival and the chili relleno stuffed with shrimp was soooo yummy that I am going back this weekend for more. The ice tea has a subtle mango flavor which was a nice touch. The salsa, I am still trying to figure out what the spice is that is in it. It is great. Just the right amount of spicy and chunky and flavor. 

Service was great, fast, friendly. Atmosphere is great as well. Everything looked very clean. They have a \"family\" restroom and I have a daughter who uses a wheelchair so I was impressed that they have the extra bathroom which is always much easier and more convienent when you use a wheelchair."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best chips, nachos and Taco Tuesday. Lovely indoors or out! Friday nights get a bit busy/.."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place for Mexican food. I frequented this establishment a few times a month and would bring all out-out-town guests here. My past few experiences here, however, have been disappointing. Most recently, a few months ago I hosted a bridal shower there and had terrible service. We waited forever before our server arrived, waited forever for our food, and when our food did arrive, it was cold. We ate it anyways as we had been waiting forever and were hungry but politely informed our server, to which she flippantly replied that \"it had been a busy night.\" I was embarrassed as I was the hostess of this party and our experience put a major damper on our evening. I wrote them on Facebook informing them of my experience, and the owner kindly sent me a response back asking for my address and informing me that he would send a gift card as a token of his apology. I was touched by his kindness and decided to give the restaurant another try, so I sent him my address but the gift card never arrived.

I give the restaurant a 3 because up until my past few experiences here, the food had been excellent. Maybe they just went through a rough patch, but I'm still disappointed."}
{"text":"The nachos were huge, and pretty good. Would definitely have them again!"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable lunch of shrimp in a chili lime sauce my husbands huge burrito was more than  satisfying the service was friendly and knowledgeable we were in and out in no time without feeling rushed !"}
{"text":"A tale of two restaurants.  

First experience was early evening on the patio sitting at the bar. Great experience, good drinks and good food. The sweet corn tamales and nachos were very good.

Second experience was so different. We went during the day and were seated inside. Nothing was even near as good as our first trip. Drinks were messy - one margarita had coconut sugar crap dripping down the side of the cup so you couldn't even grab the glass. The food was generic Mexican at best which just doesn't fly in Scottsdale. 

Takeaway: The bad outweighs the good - unless you happen to arrive after dark and sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is amazing and the servers are wonderful. We have been here multiple of times. We always sit at the bar and Paige is amazing."}
{"text":"We have been to this location many times, food is consistently delicious and serivce is always good. Unfortunately their other location (DC Ranch) has a problem with service and getting the orders correct."}
{"text":"It's always nice when the owner of the restaurant asks how you're doing. That's the service you get every time from Jalapeño Inferno in North Scottsdale.

The lighting is better in the bar, so I prefer to sit there. We shared the green corn tamales, always a treat, but I don't think they need the cheese in them. 

My wife got some kind of fried mexican pizza that was huge and delicious (most of it is in my fridge this morning). I tried the Goat Cheese and Mushroom Enchiladas and they were super tasty, as were the black beans on the side.

The *Princess Margarita was good, but she said it was little too tart. I had The Boss and the Top Shelf, each unique and tasty, but I'll stick with the Top Shelf Margarita only next time.

Overall, this place is great! I thought I remembered it having fewer vegetarian options, but I was good-to-go. I do, however, wish they added something meatless to the spicy section of the menu. I know how good that inferno sauce is ;)

Turns out the owners opened a new place recently for American food, wine and rock-and-roll, Rhythm and Wine. Looking forward to trying that too."}
{"text":"Let's start with the chips and salsa. They give you normal crispy chips AND decadently fluffy tortilla chips with a really fresh salsa. Super duper tasty!

Now, I can't remember what I had the first few times I came here but I know I was blown away. However, the only thing that matters anymore are the spinach enchalads. They are served with a incredibly flavorful red sauce and then topped with another white sauce and get this - TOASTED ALMOND SLICES. Yes, toasted almond slices. These lil' babies add the most insane texture to the creaminess of the cheese and spinach filling. I would love to have a plate of these right now - at 8:03am. The rice and beans are also excellent.

I can't speak to the alcohol selection too well but I did have a non-alcoholic prickly pear margarita and it was rather scrumptious. I was assured the one with alcohol was just as tasty and you get a ridiculous sucker in the shape of a cactus.

My only complaint is the service can be hit or miss. Last time I went was father's day around 1 or 2 and the place wasn't very busy. Our server was a bit of an airhead (and rather squeaky but that's not their fault)."}
{"text":"We were first-time visitors to this restaurant on Saturday night. I was blown away by the personal attention given to us by the staff. The hostess asked if it was our first time there, and then she notified our waitress, who gave us a complimentary sweet corn tamale (which was delicious). They were also running a special on their facebook page for a one-cent margarita with the purchase of an entree. The margaritas and the food were delicious. The tortillas and the chips were fresh and tasty. The only blah items were the salsa (fresh, but bland) and the fried ice cream dessert (which came out soggy). Our waitress was so personable and spent lots of time checking on us and chatting. The manager also came by to welcome us. We will definitely go here again, and I look forward to trying the honey flan next time."}
{"text":"When Jalapeno's remodeled their bar area, things just got better.  They also started having lots of drink specials and Thursday ladies night events like a margarita and a manicure.  I even went once when they were having a promo and enjoyed $1 margaritas for a couple of hours.  If you live in N. Scottsdale, Jalapeno's is a great option for lunch or dinner or just a few margaritas and some chips and salsa.  The food is good; my friends and I would always get a variety of appetizers and share them.  The Mexican pizza is really good and my friend swears by their chimichangas.  I had a pomegranate margarita that was awesome, but their plain old rocks/salt marg is pretty tasty too.  Honestly, there are probably better places to go for Mexican food, but not really up north. So if you live in the area, I definitely recommend checking out Jalapeno's."}
{"text":"We're out-of-towners who got some food to go because we just wanted to vegetate in the hotel room and watch some TV. So, no comments on service. However, I will say that the food was ready fast (within 15 minutes of my call) and quite tasty, and I've had Mexican throughout Cali and the Southwest. It's not \"authentic\", but you're not going to find that in Scottsdale, and at least this isn't a total chain."}
{"text":"The good first... seriously such a cute patio, cute vibe, friendly staff, and quiet enough to talk and visit. The ehhh.. food was just OK, I had mahi mahi tacos and my husband had Carne Asana tacos, we each ordered \"The Boss\" margarita and it was so bad. Like nasty, my husband immediately pushed it away and didn't have one sip. I felt bad a had a few.  It was the weirdest taste it was like something was added to the drinks and was sour.. nonetheless our server never asked how are your drinks? Is something wrong? Because I argue with people all week at work I decided paying 15 per margarita and not drinking it was better than complaining, but I think there was a missed opportunity to a) identify what went wrong at the bar b) keep people that just moved here recently as customers that will keep coming back. Overall I think a great little spot could have totally been a one off experience for us"}
{"text":"Best happy hour around. Very good food fair prices. Good service. Recommend chicken quesadilla."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE restaurant in all of Arizona!! They have the best green corn tamales, chimis and pretty much any other Mexican food you can think of. It's a family owned restaurant so they will take great care of you! We always leave happy with the hot food and happy with the service."}
{"text":"Awesome, consistent, delicious food.  We travel from Northern AZ for this gem!!!  Delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious food, we got the Courtney, the Cobb with Mango dressing and pulled pork  with red sauce. Margaritas were perfect. Flavorful and not too sweet. 

The wait staff were prompt and friendly. Made sure we always had chips, salsa, full water glasses and made sure we were enjoying the drinks and food.

The restaurant had a great atmosphere. The decor was warm and made you feel very relaxed. Just enough TVs to keep up on the game but not too many that they were a distractions."}
{"text":"I'm sitting in the car, about to leave the parking lot and suddenly it hits me...

It had been quite awhile since I had been to Jalapeño Inferno and was ready to venture a little from home to get some spicy pseudo-Mexican American food, because I remembered it being so satisfying.
Apparently it has been for good reason I haven't made this trek in awhile. In short, I haven't missed anything. 

We started off with the guacamole...

Did you expect an awesome description? 
I expected guacamole. What I did get was a few avocados shoved into a blender with a tomato and slopped onto a plate. Really, Jalapeño? You sprinkle some cheese on it and bring it out to me with a chip in the middle? Apparently whoever was in the kitchen even gave up when they were attempting to taste it.

My girlfriend ordered the Texas Style Stacked Enchiladas and I, being the spicy food connoisseur I am, went with my past favorite Courtney's Special. The enchiladas? She hated them. Her family creates genuine authentic Mexican food on a daily basis, of course she had no problem dismantling the disaster that lay before her. \"It looks like a confused stack of tostadas,\" I agreed. They were good for what they were, and sometimes it pays to think outside the box and I can appreciate that. In this case though, maybe start with an actual enchilada and work your way up from there. It can't be that hard and I'm sure if you asked, someone would gladly show you how to accomplish it. Next, the Courtney's Special, grilled chicken (which was very juicy, kudos) and black beans with a big helping of cilantro. It wasn't anything like what I remembered it being. To make it worse, it wasn't even that spicy. That sucks too, considering the only reason I come here is for that particular burrito. Oh well.

It seems to me that the owners are a little preoccupied with their newest establishment, hell, they even gave me a $5 gift card to their Rhythm & Wine Bistro when they carried my half ton check over and nonchalantly lowered it down onto the table. Minor exaggeration. 

The bill: $42 for the burrito, the enchiladas, avocado purée, a water and a tea.

Here's my tip: take it from the guys that know it best. This close to Mexico, and with as many authentic Mexican food places we have here in Phoenix, it shouldn't be that hard to do some homework and take a couple cues from the creators. Keep it simple, keep it cheap, keep it awesome.

Two stars for my waitress who, despite never refilling my tea in the hour and half we sat in the establishment, kept a bubbly attitude. That I appreciate."}
{"text":"Had  delicious lunch, shredded chicken soft taco and spinach enchilada.  Checked in for a free plate of wonderful guacamole.  Always a favorite!!!"}
{"text":"This is another Northern Scottsdale Mexican restaurant that I have been coming to for many, many years. Good Mexican food, not too fancy but definitely has some flare. I great place to sit outside under the misters and enjoy a margarita for happy hour.

Highly recommended for anyone looking for good Mexican food.

Tip: I usually order a child size cause I can't eat a full portion."}
{"text":"Good upscale Mexican with good service. This is a Normal Weekend Restaurant for my family ."}
{"text":"Haven't been in the Southwest for awhile, but lived in Albuquerque for 15 years, so I know authentic Northern New Mexican cuisine - this place was great! Authentic food, excellent staff to customer ratio=speedy service, & very good margaritas - would go back in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there today. Pretty much got in an out in an hour, which was a plus. Food was so-so, waitress was not GREAT but not bad. The flour chips are really good, but I don't care for the corn ones, and the basket is a mix. The salsa is good, but could use a little kick. I had a combo and got a beef enchilada and a beef soft taco. Didn't care for the enchilada but the taco wasn't bad. Did not care for the beans but the rice was actually pretty good. My boyfriend got the chicken tacos and they were really good with an avocado cilantro dressing. Overall, Eh, but I had a groupon so I wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"Steak torta sandwich was excellent. 
Great service. 
Best Mexican food in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"It was \"under construction\" when I visited yesterday, but I enjoyed dining in their cantina nonetheless.

Good quality from the chips and salsa to my chicken wrap. Reasonable lunch specials, and I am guessing an amazing atmosphere from the look of the work going on in the dining room.

I shall return!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Great, authentic  Mexican food for a reasonable price. Plenty of menu options to choose from. Chips and salsa are divine!  I would come here just for those. Second time here and will definitely come again. :)"}
{"text":"This was the perfect groupon purchase. Thirty dollars worth of food for 17 dollars. The food was really good. We had the Fondito and Steak fajitas. The serving sizes were super good for the price. The chips were corn and flour tortillas.  We also had two different types of salsa. What a great experience nestled in a little strip mall on Scottsdale Rd and Pinnacle Peak.  Try it if you haven't."}
{"text":"Best mex in Scottsdale. Super cute and trendy. Best margs and salsa in town. Get the shrimp taco or Courtney's burrito!"}
{"text":"Very good chips and salsa and very good service.  Food was good. Bartender poured a very heavy (but tasty) blackberry margarita. Thankfully I wasn't driving home. I think the rest of the meal was also good."}
{"text":"Finally made it in time for Happy Hour! Got 3 'appetizers' for the 2 of us and could NOT finish!! A lot of really good food at very reasonable prices. Good variety on Happy Hour too. Drinks were good pours and could get house or premium. 
ALSO, it was mentioned to us by Vinnie that they now do reverse Happy Hour 8-10 PM 7 nights a week!"}
{"text":"The guacamole was delicious and that started  us off with a thirst ! The drinks were filling as were the rest of the apps! Great food, good service and very affordable especially at Happy Hour?"}
{"text":"Great service. Quick and super laid back and our waitress even honored a 10% off Yelp coupon that was for a different Phoenix location. The food we got was excellent - get anything with the shredded pork and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place has gone way down hill from the last time I ate here. I came here with my mom about 2 months ago for dinner at around 5:30ish. It was pretty busy but not over ally crowded. We got seated right away which was nice but had to wait about 5 minutes before our waiter came to our table. After getting our drinks and ordering our food we had to wait a good 30 minutes before our food came out. I ordered the 'chicken tacos al carbon' and immediately my order was wrong. I asked for corn tortillas and got flour. I also asked for a side of guacamole but got sour cream instead? Okay I like sour cream but would like what I ordered. I had to wait another 5 minutes for someone to come by so I could tell them the 2 things they messed up and then had to wait another 10 minutes just for my food to me corrected! My mom's food came out cold and after mine came out the correct way it was cold. Needless to say we ate dinner at home because the food was not worth eating. The only good thing was the drinks and chips and salsa. The manager didn't even come over to say anything about what happened and we still had to pay the bill for full price which was WAY overpriced. This place used to be so good but has gone downhill fast. I won't be coming back here probably for a while unless they change up the way their service is."}
{"text":"Sitting here wondering why we set foot in this place right now. Absolutely awful service and it's 3pm with maybe 10 people eating here. No drinks no waitress....oh finally got our drinks and some chips after 20 minutes. Update....ran out of chips 20 minutes ago still no waitress. Update ordered food....took it to go...."}
{"text":"The service and food has improved greatly over the years. The owners themselves are not friendly at all, but the super friendly staff including Samantha, Michael, Steven, Beau and Aaron are all rock stars in my book and make up for it. The food is super fresh and delicious and while it could be interpreted as a bit pricey, the quality is very high and the portions are plentiful."}
{"text":"Jalapeno's has a fun atmosphere, good outdoor seating, good service, and pretty decent Mexican food. 

They had great fresh salsa with a mix of chips. I ordered a combo platter with a shredded beef taco and a green corn tamale. Both were very tasty. The tamale was a tad on the dry side, but still above average. The beans and rice were okay. 

They offer a variety of margaritas. Our very attentive server insisted that a margarita called \"The Boss\" was the best one. We ordered them and they tasted like tequila with some lime. Too strong for me, but it was popular with the guys. Much to our server's disdain, I ordered a *gasp* blended margarita. Much better and easier to enjoy. 

I wouldn't go out of the way, but if you're up north and craving Mexican food, Jalapeno's is a good bet."}
{"text":"This place rocks! The only reason I don't give it five stars is because I reserve that for nicer restaurants that have out of this world food! Jalepeno Inferno has great food though! The flour tortilla chips are amazing, great menu selection, and all the dishes seem to be yummy. We've been more than 6 times and are never disappointed. Definitely worth going to!"}
{"text":"WOW! 

Second time was even better than the first. I had an appetizer and my wife had an entree. Both were excellent. What really made this trip special was our server JJ (Jordan). She was outstanding in every way. Awesome smile and attitude and we really liked her drink suggestions. 

Bottom line is this place rocks and we will return again and again. Props to the owners, management and employees!"}
{"text":"Is what it is- a Tex-Mex in a strip mall.   However, food is really good and the standards- Tacos, Nachos, Burritos, Fajitas all are solid.  If you have a family or big group and want to get a good meal at a good price, I would recommend.  Have been here several times while on vacation and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"The past three times I have been here I have gotten sick!  Talked to another person the other day that had also been sick the next day after eating here.  Won't be going back.  Not worth getting sick over!"}
{"text":"What did you do to the bar area? You took away the authenticity and intimacy of this once great place. You blew it!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service! Our server, Joy, was very attentive and friendly and made great recommendations! The food was pretty good. You're not going to get \"great\" in North Scottsdale, though. Chips and salsa are very good and so is the spinach enchilada."}
{"text":"Large portion sizes and reasonable prices.

Burrito and steak fajitas. The beef was tender. Both entrees were just buried in salt. Sure, this means, if you're a drinker - and, maybe, not paying attention - that you'll want another beer. But, it really was overwhelmingly salty.

Friendly staff. Clean restroom. OK ticket times.

I wouldn't go out of my way but I would go back."}
{"text":"Sampler platter was the perfect starter appetizer. The arroz pollo soup was very tasty. Margarita was good too! Cute place that we would recommend you try with family or friends"}
{"text":"We love this place.  The best Mexican or TexMex we have found in the NE Valley.  Our absolute favorite is Courtney's Inferno burritto - it has just the right amount of spice and flavor.  So yummy!!  We love it so much, we have a really hard time ordering anything else.  But when we have branched out, its always been fantastic too.  Also love the Prickly Pear margarita (and I'm not really a tequila fan).  They have a great patio and did a great job with the remodel of the bar area too, which now opens to the patio.  Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Exceptionally rude waiter, probably won't go back Too bad because the food was exceptional as always."}
{"text":"Best chips and salsa in the valley. Food is consistent service is not but overall one of my go to spots for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"One of our favorite go to Mexican restaurants. Excellent happy hour selection as well. Good spot to meet big group of friends for happy hour. I love there chips and salsa. Food and service is always excellent. Our go to spot."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I try out new restaurants almost once a week. This one being close to home we thought we'd try it this week, had pretty good reviews. We got to try their famous green chili tamale, it had good flavor but was mostly masa. I had the spinach and almond enchilada and Chile relleno it was good. But the service wasn't very consistant. The waitress was nice and informative about the menu but very slow in coming back to us to take our order and too refill our drinks. But I would try it again because the food was good and they had some different twist to tradition Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"First time coming to this location and everything was perfect. Hailey was our waitress and probably gave us the best service we've ever had! She was on top of her game with her food recommendations. 

I ordered the burro FILLED with shredded beef! Good came out within 10 minutes. We will have to come back and try some new items & definitely dessert!"}
{"text":"The food here used to be so good. Unfortunately, the food had suffered over the past few year and is saltier than a salt lick. The food has zero Mexican sophistication and has lost its luster. The margaritas are terrible which is sad because they used to be really good. Now they are WAY too acidic and taste terrible. Owners really need to change it up!"}
{"text":"Tyler our server was fantastic.   He was pleasant quick and efficient.   I ordered the fish tacos without realizing there were two kinds of fish tacos on the menu.  Needless to say I had ordered the fried cod tacos versus the grilled mahi mahi tacos.  Too much green sauce on top of the tacos - very heavy dish for me."}
{"text":"We had a good time here.  The waitresses and manager were friendly with us and the food was tasty.  I wish it was actually a little spicier though.  For a place called Jalapeno Inferno Bistro they should have some KILLER hot sauce but they didn't.  I really like the look of this place on the inside.  High ceilings and cool southwestern style paintings are on the walls.  I did like the Kick Ass Tex Ass margarita.  Yummy."}
{"text":"I always get the appetizer sweet corn green tamales, they are the best around! I order them with a side of guac, and yum! You have a great meal! Chips are also really good! I enjoy the flour ones, they taste like a tortilla bowl that a taco salad comes in!"}
{"text":"Very experienced owners who definitely know what they are doing! The best part bout this place: They seriously give a crap about their customers, unlike a lot of local chains. They will always do their best to accommodate you - whether it be for food allergies/intolerances/special diets, or reservations. The menu offers a ton of variety. A little secret: The owner loves good quality beef, hence, the burger and the carne/steak are AWESOME. Something good for folks who may not be int he mood for traditional mexican food, but are going with a group."}
{"text":"Fresh and hot.. Great prices. Flour and corn chips mixed which is great. Huge $10 lunch specials. Great to be in AZ for some Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here since I was a kid.  In my early days, service was never good.  However, with those delicious flour tortilla chips and great salsa, who could really be sad?  Yesterday, however, all of that changed.  We had the best waiter of all time, Aaron, who is basically psychic, brought us extra salsas, entertained our toddler child (yeah... we've been eating here a VERY long time!)  and had our table laughing after a long drive from southern AZ.  He was amazing, efficient, and the true definition of what I call \"Arizona service\" (the exceptional level of customer service that AZ has that L.A. certainly does not!)  
I would visit 100 times if I knew Aaron was gonna be our waiter.  He made our day a better one, and of course, our cheese crisp, green corn tamales, and other thing that had lots of cheese on some chicken were all amazing this time.  Thank you Aaron again and again for the efficient refills and fantastic above-and-beyond service!!! You are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service.  The manager Jen is great and always makes sure we have every we need.  Best Mexican food and great service! I love Courtney's burrito and also the fajitas."}
{"text":"Great little place - would be amazing in the cooler weather of fall / winter with the outdoor patios. 

For the vegan crowd they offer a veggie fajitas. I didn't bother to ask if there was dairy, but it didn't taste like it, but was very tasty - if only lacking a bit of seasoning on the veggies - but I would rather that than too much salt. 

The service was good. The manager checked up on our large party and we had a good experience. If you're in north scottsdale and want Mexican it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Yumm Yumm Yummmm! I just went here for the first time just a few days ago and really liked it. They have a large menu with lots of authentic options. I had a chile relleno which reminded me of the ones my Abuela used to make. Can't wait to return and try more of their enticing options!"}
{"text":"Good service but average fare. Was expecting better food based on reviews and prices. Food ingredients were good, but taste was average. Quesadilla seemed a bit overcooked and the texture was not appealing, but ended up eating the protein only."}
{"text":"This place's food is GOOD . . . REALLY GOOD.  There is nothing that I have ordered there that I have not liked.  It is also convenient for us as it's about 2 miles from our home.

HOWEVER, the service is NEVER GOOD.  I have eaten there with my husband 3 times.  The 1st time, we ate there kind of late.  We were among 3 or 4 tables of people left in the place.  The waitress seemed tired and didn't really seem to care that we were there.  She was far from friendly and the service was far from marvelous.  It took longer than I feel it should to get our food.

The second time we ate there, we sat in the bar area.  The bartender/server was eventually friendly this time, but only by the point we were about to leave.  In the beginning she didn't seem to care much and was just kind of blah.  I think maybe she warmed up because they got my order wrong.  I don't like refried beans so I asked if I could have a double rice portion instead of rice and beans.  When I ordered, the server said that was fine, but my plate came with beans and rice anyway.  She did offer to take the whole thing back and fix it, but I was so hungry, I just kept the plate.  Again, it takes quite a while to get your food whether they are busy or not.

The 3rd time we were there was last night (my husband, our baby, and a friend of mine).  They messed up my order AGAIN.  This time I had asked for tamales with no cheese over the top of them.  It came with cheese on the top.   This time, I was so frustrated, I didn't even bother to bring it up to the server and she didn't even notice it was wrong.  If she would have, with her attitude I doubt she would have genuinely cared anyway.  Again, it takes so long to get your food out at this restaurant when it's slow that I just sucked it up and ate it anyway as this was a Friday night and BUSY.  The server again was blah.  Not bad, but not friendly.

In conclusion, this restaurant could greatly improve its Yelp reviews if they would make an effort to make people feel appreciated and welcome.  The staff needs a lesson in customer service and they need to get a good flow of positive energy going.  

THEY ALSO NEED TO BE MORE CAREFUL ABOUT GETTING THEIR ORDERS CORRECT!!!  LIKE I SAID, I HAVE EATEN THERE 3 TIMES AND MY ORDER WAS WRONG TWICE.  To me, that is not acceptable.  I sincerely hope someone from management there reads this so that they can fix it because the atmosphere there as well as the food is good.  That's why I gave them 3 chances despite my past experiences.  Sorry, guys - 3 strikes - YOU'RE OUT!!!"}
{"text":"Great meal and very good service. Had the lobster street tacos and they were delicious!  Love the attention to all the ingredients used in the dishes-hard to make a decision. Home made chips were a hit at the table. Everyone at our table of six were very pleased with the meal. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Holy jalepeños!!!  This place is awesome. The food came lightening fast. We ordered the steak nachos and the chicken quesadilla. Both were delicious. To top it off, our waitress, Karlie was one of the best servers that we have had in a long time. She was personable yet fast. We suggest you get your jalapeño in here as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Went here the other night. So good! The black cherry Sangria is a little on the sweeter side. 

We had appetizer sampler, I highly recommend it. You get to taste everything and it's perfect to share. 

The chips and salsa you get first are fresh, hot and made in house. Be careful, don't fill up on them! It's easy to do. I will go here again."}
{"text":"Not being from Scottsdale, Arizona or even the Southwest, I'm not entirely sure how I ended up all the way out at this joint or how where this place is still qualifies as Scottsdale.  A girl said \"Meet me here\" and like a good boy with nothing but the best of intentions, I complied.

Nonetheless, the food is very decent, and I would recommend that you ask for a side of the hot green sauce, which is entirely constituted from peppers with the same name as the restaurant.  It adds a lot.  

If this place were a planet in our solar system and Phoenix was the sun, you'd be dining on Neptune, but if you happen to be out this way and don't know any better, you'll be happy."}
{"text":"I hosted a wedding rehearsal dinner for 30 people on the patio last weekend. The manager Veronica was very accommodating and responsive in the planning process. We had a beautiful buffet and our waiter Aaron was a huge hit with all of our guests. All of our local and out of town visitors were delighted by their experience and as the host, I was very relieved and pleased that the evening event worked out so well. I highly recommend using Jalapeño Inferno for a large party."}
{"text":"Service and related issues have worsened this past year.  A few examples...  Slow service, multiple occasions can't find our server to order a 2nd margarita.  Witnessed staff having personal conversations while multiple tables needed something.  When not busy, we were ready to order yet our server walked past us 4-5 times without greeting us.  One occasion the food arrived before the margaritas (again, when not busy, which is an odd occurrence for drinks ).  

We seem to always receive our queso appetizer when we're out of chips and the server often walks away before we can ask, or the server forgets when we ask (meanwhile staring at an un-eatable cheese dip that is cooling off and thickening, wishing oh so much gosh... if only we had chips with this cheese dip). This should never happen and actually the dippable appetizers ought to be served with more chips anyway. Heck, in general it is harder to get salsa or chip refills, but perhaps that is intentional?  

Some of the female servers, bartenders, managers seem rather friendly with each other.  There isn't the same professionalism; it's as if everything is extra casual now.  Hostess issues too.  Standing by the hostess station, we watched everyone who arrived after us be seated before us, and we come to discover the hostess crossed us off the wait list without calling our name (and no real apology or anything).  

All of these things were uncommon when the owners were frequently present in years past before the opening of two additional restaurants.  I fear this place has descended into a sort of resting on one's laurels status wherein they don't need to worry about these sorts of matters any longer.

And what happened to the vegetarian and gluten free menus? Hostess claims that someone stole them.  Odd.  Perhaps there is an alternative explanation."}
{"text":"I love me some good Mexican food, and this place does not disappoint I got the combo, chile relleno and a cheese enchilada. I will be back, I'm glad to have found such a great Mexican restaurant in our new town."}
{"text":"Love the chips, salsa and guacamole. Have never been disappointed with anything we've ordered. Favorite Mexican restaurant in the area!"}
{"text":"we have come to this location many times and are always so pleased with the service and food. Jordyn had been our server several times and tonight as well, very attentive and interactive with her customers. I cannot recommend this place enough!!"}
{"text":"We have been going here for over 10 years. It is dependable for great food and good service. The margaritas are fantastic and we have had just about everything on the menu with no disappointments.  Love the flour chips and salsa. Green corn tamales are a treat!"}
{"text":"WATCH YOUR CREDIT CARD & PERSONAL INFORMATION! Being at a Mexican Restaurant decided to order a round of margaritas for the table, the waitress asked for our ID's and walked off with them. (okay so she went to scan them, so we thought) came back with a clipboard filled out with our DL#, DOB, other personal information and said all the restaurants in Scottsdale do this... well I've never had to sign a clipboard before ordering a drink, especially with personal information written out by the server.  Okay, so that was an annoyance, but we can move on and maybe give them a second chance. Well, checking my credit card statement a week later find out that the server over charged our credit card by $40 when we have the second copy stating the total the card was swiped for. Even have the servers name (Sydney S.) as printed on the receipt.

Food was only mediocre with entrées being brought to the table 30 seconds after the soup was brought."}
{"text":"We have been here several times for dinner and have enjoyed our meal. However this is a horrible place for Easter Brunch with small children.  They had nothing a child would eat. No pancakes, cereal, yogurt or even fruit! The \"pastries\" were bite sized desserts. Muffins, danishes and doughnuts are pastries. I'm assuming they have never done this before because the service was horrible the layout for the buffet was a mess yet they automatically add a 17% service charge to your bill. I had to ask for some chips and salsa and basically that and the made to order omelette were the only thing worth eating. So disappointing for a special occasion with my family."}
{"text":"stopped in here with rents as it has became a staple for them. Very good food they have flour and corn chips personally my favorite Is the flour chips. Also got a chicken chimichanga I think the spelling is correct lol anyways. They offer 2 sizes large and larger I think it was a pound and half a pound. Trust me a half a pound is all you need. Verry good food quality. The sound on a wed was not bad. I expect some noise on the weekends. Verry fast service from server to kitchen and kitchen to server took about 15 max 20 mins for our food to get there. They are opening a new one near market street kitchen in the d.c. ranch area maybe higher end stuff skirt steaks idk. but sounds good. Will be back."}
{"text":"Food was great (5 stars), service was less than mediocre (1 star is being generous). Watch out for Candace."}
