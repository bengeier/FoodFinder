{"text":"1. Big eye tuna sliders ($10.96): Ahi bigeye tuna, wasabi napa slaw, sweet soy, pickled ginger - I ordered this appetizer for lunch and it was enough for me. Good balance of slaw and fish. The buns were soft and toasted."}
{"text":"I went there last night with friends, as a party of three. I have to say that was a great experience in Union Social. We ordered the recommended steak, and wow! That was amazing! The candy salad was okay, not a must-have. But both the tuna slider(forgot the name, but it's an appetizer) and chicken quizonnal(don't know how to spell, but it's also an appetizer, with smoke chicken and cheese blended, and baked in a triangle shape)  are worth trying! In terms of drinks, I would say it's okay, but I had better ones. Then, we ordered Nachos with extra cheese and edamame. Both are GREAT! I especially love the Nachos(when it's hot--crispy and the melted cheese...) Anyway, a nice place. And a thank-you to our wonderful waitress--Rachel!"}
{"text":"Bad idea I ordered a chicken club with raisin bread the bread was horrible and burnt to a crisp I also ordered chicken wings and they weren't that great either wouldn't order takeout from them that's for sure"}
{"text":"2 appetizers and 2 mains (Burger and a Chicken Caesar) with 2 cokes for $75.00 makes this place very pricy. Not to mention tips choices on the machine are at set to 1- 20%,2- 18%, and 3- 16% which encourages service to be mediocre - because the least you can get as a terrible waiter is 16%. (Yes you can choose the fixed amount and tip $0.00, but most people chose the % for the convenience of not having to struggle with numbers and won't cancel the entire transaction to $0.00 the tip). Oh wait! Aren't tips supposed to be 0-15%? (Tsk tsk!). Maybe 10%-15%-20%?  Service:  Good - Keep an eye out for empty glasses for refill on drinks please!  Food:  Calamari very good! Though I wouldn't call the white sauce tzaziki - it's closer to a creamy dill cucumber dip. Avocado Mash: Good texture but bland. Missing a bit of salt? Maybe add a bit of feta? Roasted Garlic Ceasar was solid. Make sure you love garlic!  Burger UFO is a good burger, good flavour with hints of Dijon - but a little dry.  All and all, not a favourite. OK food is not worth the price tag. Kelsey's, Montana's and other similar establishments offer a similar/better experience for less. People expect A LOT more for $75.00."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Service is good, waitress were nice and very friendly, however, food is average... I was surprised that they served beer but didn't even offer a glass for it. So you are expected to drink from the bottle. Btw, the glasses they brought were with finger prints so not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place, a happy addition to Yonge and St. Clair. It's about time! I've been for brunch, lunch, dinner and just drinks and each time I have not been disappointed by the food and drink quality, as well as the service. Especially love the drink specials and friendly staff. It would be great if there was signage to the restrooms. Everyone always walks to the back thinking they are there but they are in the basement at the front of the space."}
{"text":"At last, I can enjoy great pub fare north of Bloor. I live in the neighbourhood and this place has been a blessing.  The food here is excellent. The menu is full of varied and tasty foods. My worst experience has been a 6/10 penne, but everything else has been great: huge fish and chips, tasty killer chicken specials, and a good selection of appetizers.  The service is also excellent. Each of the servers I have had recognizes my groups and I, we get a personal 'hello' from the manager, and staff are prompt.  The atmosphere is also very nice. It is a diverse crowd of local professionals, a few families, friends, and groups.  If you like to socialize in a pub setting with friends, this is a perfect spot."}
{"text":"food was ok, expansive menu, nice thing it is open till late, sushi was ok, but flat bread pizza was a waste of money"}
{"text":"Love the food. The Chicken Taquitos, Chicken Rose Penne and Blueberry Cheesecake are absolutely amazing. The setting is very social, just like its name sounds. It's a bit too loud for my liking though.   Servers are nice, service is okay (in regards to timeliness). I guess the service can be slow depending on what time of the day you dine since it may be busier than usual."}
{"text":"Reviews of this stylish roadhouse restaurant are accurate, this is an upscale alternative to the usual strip mall chain eateries and bars.  Service is friendly and prompt.  We had two excellent burgers, tasty and well presented.  Worth a detour if you are in the Mississauga boonies."}
{"text":"Sharon is amazing!   Great service, good food and decent drink specials... Don't know what more you could want?"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Not the best. Nothing outstanding. Service was great though. I just don't see myself comming back here."}
{"text":"First off, I have to state this restaurant has been on my mind for years. I haven't for some reason took the time to make my first visit, that is until last night. After having some horrible experiences at other restaurants I decided it was time.   I must state if Yelp had a 6 star option I'd definitely give this restaurant such a deserving grade.   It was adequately packed when we first arrived and elected to take a seat at the bar while we waited for a booth to open up. Our experience with the bartender was phenomenal. Drinks were good. Calamari was decent. Once seated, we ordered the almond crusted chicken tenders and the mahi mahi. Both tasted amazing and the portion sizes were phenomenal. We also had the cheesecake which was delicious and a pretty generous size of slice. Service was attentive and prompt. The atmosphere of the restaurant was welcoming and very appropriate.  I'd swear I have found a new favourite restaurant. Let's just hope my subsequent visits will have the same experiences as my first."}
{"text":"I got the Chicken Panang Noodle bowl and truffle fries when I went. It was pretty good, although, the noodle bowl had too much peanut butter for my taste. The wait staff could be friendlier."}
{"text":"This is my third time visiting this establishment. Each time I've had to wait at least 10 minutes to see a member of the wait staff. Tonite was no different, it was 15 minutes to get my drink order while I noticed that staff are talking to each other. It seems that customer service doesn't appear to be a priority at this establishment. It's too bad because I do think the menu is innovative and interesting."}
{"text":"An amazing menu that's both classic with a contemporary and international penchant. Great service, daily specials and a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Since my last review, I find I can't stop coming here. The food is fantastic and staff are friendly. This is truly a nice place to eat, have a drink, take in a game, or even just read. Very relaxed and casual with a nice decor.   I have tried the hamburgers, chicken vindaloo curry, and Steamwhistle beer-battered fish and chips. All were excellent. Cooked just the way I like it.   This place seems to take pride in their food. The draft beers are always fresh. Cheers."}
{"text":"This place is good for large groups but don't come here for a warm ambience. The place felt like a cold renovated industrial warehouse. Nothing special except for their drink specials. The waitresses seem friendly however ours \"forgot\" to give back change for $20 on a $11 bill and when we got up to ask for it she didn't apologize nor seemed surprised at all. Wouldn't return to this location and the staff needs to learn some manners."}
{"text":"Came here on Father's Day with my girlfriend and her parents around noon and were seated immediately and brought drinks to start promptly. We've lived in the area for almost a year now but this was our first time at this establishment and we were pleasantly surprised. The menu was extensive and we all thoroughly enjoyed our meals. We will definitely be returning to check out the rooftop patio before the summer is over."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  Service was great and the food was good as well.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich with portabello and  melted havarti cheese which was very good.  Seems like it is a big happy hour place. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks, or to watch a game, but the food is definitely not the star here.  The dishes taste like they were made with minimal effort and with average ingredients.  Nothing tasted fresh and nothing was memorable."}
{"text":"Went in with a large group at lunchtime on a weekday with no reservation. The place was very busy but we got a big table with a booth right away. It was a little loud in there, hard to hear from one side of the table to the other. The service was excellent. Very friendly. They gave us free nachos because it was our first time visiting as well as a free dessert because we were celebrating a special occasion. The portions were large. The food was pretty good. The side salad options were great. Lots of drink refills and attention. Better than an average pub experience but just a little on the noisy side."}
{"text":"Great food and menu. I've been many times and have had great service. It's clean and spacious. They need more staff on the floor and bar. Seems like it's a few people doing everything"}
{"text":"Food was tasty, but not exceptional. The caesar drink was watery and not very good...don't order this. The long island ice tea was very good. The avocado dip was bland with not much taste. The calamari was good. The fries are excellent - order these for sure...and ask for malt vinegar on the side. Overall, the food varied from mediocre to just above average depending on the dish ordered. The brownie dessert was exceptional and the cookies/ice cream was very good. Service was ok. The server did not bring waters for everyone...which is odd. It is a loud environment with patrons having to almost shout due to loud music. It may not be the best choice for the elderly...we had an 85 year old in our group. Don't go here if you are looking to have a quiet meal."}
{"text":"Was extreamly excited to try this place. It had great yelp reviews but was kinda disappointed when we got there. The wait was 45 min and they had tons of open tables.   Overall the food was meh, we got a variety of food and nothing impressed that much. I would compare this spot to jack astors to be honest.   Also the beer selection is very limited. They need more local craft beer to fit the atmosphere they want to achieve."}
{"text":"Have the breakfast burger, its Ah maz inggggg!"}
{"text":"We loved our visit! The service was fantastic, the atmosphere was very fun, and all of the food was delicious - especially the chicken nachos! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My visit started not very pleasant. Long story short, my friends and I arrived at different times and the waitress sat us down at different tables. We didn't realize until 30min later. Even though this happened, the manager Esther came and brought us a free Mediterranean Dip Trio. This starter was delicious and full of flavours. My friends and I also ordered 1/2 lb of Crispy Calamari, which I personally thought was a bit soggy. For my main, I ordered the Herbed Brie Double Chicken, which came with some veggies and fries on the side. I'd give this dish 9.5/10, not only because it uses some of my favourite ingredients ever and also the chicken was perfectly cooked! My only comment is that the sides were a bit too oily.  Overall I would recommend this restaurant for a casual meet-up or a good spot to catch a game. It can get very noisy so not the best place to chit chat."}
{"text":"I liked this place!  Good food at very reasonable prices.  The service, although not super polished, was very friendly and overall I couldn't complain.  Our group shared the short rib poutine as an appetizer and we had the almond-crusted chicken tenders, candy house salad and banana coconut chicken as our mains.  Everything was very tasty and I would say above average for a chain/pub restaurant of this kind.  The desserts were...huge!  We shared the cheesecake and brownie among three people and couldn't finish them because the portions were so big.  Finally, there was a good selection of wine at reasonable prices.  We shared a decent bottle of Australian white, which was only around $30.  Although we didn't have any cocktails, their drink menu had a good selection, again at prices that wouldn't leave you with a huge bill at the end of the night.  Overall, our group left full and satisfied.  I would definitely give this place another try."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner for the first time.  We didn't need to wait for our table.  However the waiter wanted to seat us next to the rest room!  Didn't appreciate this because there were many vacant tables!   We had to select our own table that was farther away from the rest room.  The table was not far enough because we can still smell the washroom odour.  We decided to move to another table just to avoid the washroom smell.  However the next table and seat were not clean, it was dirty and sticky.  I wanted to try the fish and chips, regretted the choice the moment it arrived.  It was so disappointing, the fish and the beer batter tasted bland.  The cook need to season the fish and chips.  The beer batter was too thick and the coleslaw portion was the size of a table spoon and way too creamy.  The fries were the only thing on my plate that was good.  My boyfriend ordered the grilled salmon with caesar salad and although the grilled salmon was good, the caesar salad was extremely garlicky.  He felt sick afterwards and the next day due to the garlic overload even though he likes garlic.  They need to reduce the amount of garlic in their dressing especially when other patrons complained before.  Not sure of the high ratings because the food wasn't great, maybe for the beer?  The service was good, our waitress was nice but we won't be returning due to the poor food."}
{"text":"Service was lousy during a very slow time, 3 servers upstairs with only 6 patrons. We waited more than 30 min and still didn't take our food order, waitress was Asian with a tattoo on her shoulder. We finally got up to leave, she was rolling cutlery in napkins and chatting with the other waitresses, instead of seeing how we are doing !   Mojitos had rotten limes in them, so we finally left. If their limes are rotten, how healthy and safe is the food? I'm not ever going back and would recommend anyone going there check your food carefully or you may end up wondering why you have stomach poisoning...   When we spoke to the manager, all he offered was to put our order in \"right away\"... REALLY?   Don't go here!!!"}
{"text":"Gave this place 3 chances because I really, really wanted to like it. Trendy decor, prompt friendly service and close to where I live.   But none of that makes up for the mediocre food.  Can't,for the life of me, understand who these people are that are raving about the food."}
{"text":"We love the staff here!  Matty is a great bar manager that greeted us with a great smile and took care of us from day one.   If you want a good time , come to union and ask for Matty with the beard!!!"}
{"text":"Fri evening and busy. Had no reservations but the hostesses were super friendly and accommodating. Got us a table for 6 in only a couple minutes in a great spot. Food was great. Service was excellent...there seems to be an army of waitresses...they were everywhere! The only point for improvement was the temperature of the beer. We tried two different types and they were only cellar temp. Put the kegs in a better fridge and you have a winner."}
{"text":"Great food great service! Esther the general manager made us feel at home with her warm hospitality and gracious smile.  Thanks Esther! A great experience overall."}
{"text":"We got struck in traffic on 401 and we called and spoke to the manager that pls keep our table we r on our way....he shld have told us ur policy then we would have not wasted our time coming all the way to the restaurant.....plus u gave us a table where there was no t.v. It's a sports bar pls get some more t.v. I hope u get our point"}
{"text":"Went to Union Social today. It was our first time there.  The place was pretty busy. We had to wait 45 mins for our food.  We were pretty upset at first but the general manager spoke to us and was very apologetic about it.  While we weren't expecting anything from it, she did compensate us for the time that we waited.  The staff were very friendly, food was great, really nothing to complain about overall.  It was nice to know that the staff here cares about your overall experience.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night. Ordered the Avocado Dip (Starter), the Chicken Rose Penne and the Steamwhistle Fish and Chips. The food, service, ambiance, price - all very good! Definitely coming back here again! :-)"}
{"text":"Great ambiance & very friendly service! The food is a quality, fresh assortment of upscale pub fare and they have a decent selection of drinks. I've gone here for dinner a couple of times in groups of 4 - 15 people, always left happy.  I like that they have a (I think biweekly) sandwich special where they try out a limited time menu item. If you're feeling especially hungry, try their Cease & Desist burger. It's giant and one of the best burgers I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere. Nice decor and noise levels were lively but not overly distracting. Food is always good. Definitely pub food but good pub food. Service is friendly and has good timing. This place is big for the neighbourgood so we always get a seat."}
{"text":"I was always curious about checking out the location at St.Clair so when I saw that this one opened up in my area, I was very happy. I came with a group of friends during dinner and the place was pretty full. We were informed that there would be a wait for a table. While waiting, the female manager came outside to apologize about the wait and offered us free drinks while we waited. We were really impressed by the great service! It definitely made a great impression. The food was great as well- we got a bunch of appetizers to share among our group and they tasted amazing and were extremely filling. Try the their BBQ Short Rib Poutine- so good and savoury! I also got the Chicken Vindaloo which was great. Great place to go if you're looking for a fun, relaxed night out with your friends. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Atmosphere , service and food was excellent.  Went here on a Monday evening and it wasn't busy at all .  Check it out if you haven't been here!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to give this restaurant a try after seeing the good reviews and ratings on this site. However, we had a terrible experience here and would not recommend it to anyone else. It was so bad, I actually had to make an account just to write this review.  Foods we ordered: 1) Parmesan Truffle Fries 2) Ahi Tuna Sliders 3) Fish Tacos  The presentation of the food was decent. We didn't have to wait too long for our food either, and it wasn't busy at all when we went during dinner time. The food itself was BEYOND TERRIBLE. The fries were cold and everything tasted like it was left out in the open for like 3 hrs. None of it tasted fresh!!! Which was sooooo disappointing. We couldn't even finish our food because it was just too gross to down. The only good thing that I liked about this place was our server. Super friendly guy. A+ for him. However, the food was horrible and I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"Good food and nice service. Very new bar, only open 5 days, but not bad. The patio is still being renovated and the drafts aren't installed yet."}
{"text":"This place has good appetizers but their prices are too high. The best part is that most of the waitresses are hot and easy so if you slip them a 50 you can take one home"}
{"text":"Been there twice. Ambiance is modern and place was not too loud.First time, not so busy. Server took good care of us. Second time, too busy and server was rushing everything. Their margaritas in shoe glass is too sweet and mojito didnt have enough kick i.e tequila. Nachos were good. Veggie burger was horribly dry. My friend had special salmon and liked it. Alternative is BP."}
{"text":"A solid 3-3.5 stars.  Good, casual place to grab drinks, food and watch the game.  The hostess, our server and the manager (I assume) were all very friendly.  Also, I'm glad they kept the rooftop patio!   The menu has a good variety of items...similar to moxies/joeys.  They also have a different drink special every day of the week, so make sure you take advantage of that.   The chicken tenders are awesome!  It's not something I'd usually order but these were really good.  They have an almond crust on them and the meat is juicy.  If you feel like having something a little lighter, the candy house salad is also a good choice.  I ordered mine with seared ahi tuna, and although it was good, I actually preferred the candy house salad at the St. Clair location.  I don't know if the salad toppings change based on what's in season(?) but the one I had at this location didn't come with mangos, figs, etc....basically, less toppings but maybe the salads differ from location to location...not sure.  Either way, it was still good.   For the dudes out there....the servers here are very pretty...just sayin'. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Came here with a coworker as we were working in the neighbourhood.  We had made reservations and we were promptly seated as soon as we arrived. When the staff confirmed we were first time diners they comped us a free appetizer, the short rib firecracker which was absolutely delicious.   We split the Koren Short Rib Tacos and we both ordered the swordfish burger, me with a side of fries and gravy and he with a dragon roll side. The short rib tacos were tasty but if I had to choose between the tacos and the short rib firecracker, I would order the firecrackers any day.  As for the swordfish the roasted red pepper mayo was reminiscent of a sweet pepper jelly. It was tasty and the burger itself was good. I dont know if I would order it again because there are other items on the menu that I would like to try.   If I had to describe the atmosphere, it reminded me of a hybrid between a Montanas with all the wood/cottage-y seating arrangements and a Joeys with its lively atmosphere and modern touches.  We were happy with the service and the food. We will definitely be back to sample some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Ambiance was great. Food quality was good, except the batter on my fish and chips special became quickly soggy.... my husband had a burger that was great! Fries were really awesome! And to finish it off, we had the lindor brulee which was delicious! Overall, would definitely return and recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food I have had in this street - been living in North York for a few years, Union Social is a breath of fresh air!  The service was great - servers checking on us every now and then - with refills and if we comfortable - awesome!  I wasn't craving a burger or sandwich and tried the appetizers instead  Shrimp tacos - delicious! Steak tacos - wish there were more than 2 on a plate - heard there used to be 3 of them in a plate before! Poutine - top class - something different - gravy was nice, topped with crispy onions and steak - yummy  I would come back again to this place in a heartbeat - I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a bite. Rather than reading all these reviews, try them and then decide."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for an outing with friends. The service is amazing, waiters and managers were so sweet and offered free desert when there wasn't any short ribs left. The patio is really nice, but we opted to sit inside. The food is good. Ordered the candy salad and vegetarian flat bread. 5/5"}
{"text":"I like this place for brunch. Eggs benedict are yummy & the smashed potatoes they come with are simply delish"}
{"text":"Great place! Considering how busy it was, I was surprised they sat us right away without a reservation.   We had the calamari to start and it was perfectly done! The batter was nice and light, and the calamari wasn't gummy and overdone like it can be at other places. I had the almond crusted chicken tenders for the main and it was amazing! The chicken wasn't drenched in a batter and was so moist!  The maple dijon dip is the perfect side and the fries were perfect: skinny and crispy but still flavourful. My friend has the 5 napkin burger and raved about it.   The service was good, though nothing special. Overall, great atmosphere and good food!"}
{"text":"Food and staff and staff are wonderful !  Homemade burgers are the best! The wine and beer selection is pretty on par too !"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on the weekend. My husband had the burger with mushroom and I had the fish and chips. Nothing amazing but not bad either. Everything on the menu felt a bit overpriced for lunch but I guess that's how it is in these type of restaurants."}
{"text":"I travel a lot for work, and I am pretty picky as I love to cook and I'm good at it, but I've come here twice and both times I was let down. Union social has the right ideas, just poor execution. They have some weird flavor pairings which I think they are trying to be trendy and different with,but they don't work. I can't remember the specifics of my last meal here but, I do remember the fish tacos not being so good. The salad was great, but hey, it's hard to screw up a salad.   Tonight I had the firecracker short rib appetizer which were delicious but they were paired with sweet and spicy Thai chilly sauce. I love that type of sauce, but not with what tasted like stroganoff egg roles(delicious) They would have been complimented better by an Au Jus glaze or good gravy, not the garbage they have me as a side. My high school cafeteria churned out better.   The steak was ok, it was cooked perfect, but seemed to be a sub par grade of beef.   The truffle fries were hit or miss, the few bites that actually had truffle oil were great, this could be alleviated by tossing the fries well in a bowl before serving.   Over all it's a cool place inside with a neat feel and with very attractive ladies working, But I'm sure Toronto has more to offer from a culinary standpoint than U.S.E."}
{"text":"The service is great. The food is okay, as good as the bar food gets. It is good for groups and they are very accommodating. You can reserve online in advance for your party. The rooftop patio is super cozy and very unique. Their sandwiches, sushi, and appetizers are all good. The staff are very friendly,"}
{"text":"It's the best restaurant in North York .. Me and my husband LOVED everything that we ordered.. The atmosphere is good and the second important thing for us after food is waiter/ waitress. They were friendly and so nice .. We can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Honestly, there's nothing really wrong here. I just wasn't impressed. Admittedly, I didn't have any cocktails just lunch (burger) and a beer. That said, I may not seek it out, but I'd come back."}
{"text":"I think this has become my fav mainstream place besides Moxies. We were welcomed with a free sample of the beef firecracker. It was delicious! We almost added it to our order. We tried the almond crusted chicken and the poutine. Omg! It was yummay!!! And very filling. Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a really great restaurant with a good ambience. The food is standard American/Canadian fare with a fusion twist on some things. A tad pricier than other places, but it's tasty enough to make it worth it. I dream about their short-rib tacos at night! Also, the first time I went, they brought me a free app when they found out I hadn't been before. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time to this place last weekend. Service was just AMAZING. Waitresses were very friendly and the manager Sarah was awesome. She came up to our table, spent time taking to us. So nice to see good customer service. To top it off food was really good too! Definitely going back. Can't wait to use their patio in the summer! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service, decent food (had a mixed salad + one of the flat breads), good beer selection. Came here after 8 PM for dinner... was not expecting to find such cool place in this depressing mall."}
{"text":"I had the swordfish tacos and they were very delicious! I also loved the pomegranate martini from the bar. Excellent service from everyone we encountered and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place to meet and socialize. Great food as well and the ambience is good too."}
{"text":"Someone that lives in Mississauga had recommended the place based on their experience near them. Glad to have listened. Very friendly service.  Well priced.  Delicious food. We had a couple of the different burgers, short rib tacos, tuna sliders and swordfish tacos.  We all thought it was great. We ended it with the cookies and ice cream.  Just amazing soft cookies. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Union Social Eatery is a lovely place with a very warm and cozy atmosphere.  The menu is pretty diverse.  I think that most people would be able to find something that they like here.  I ordered the Roasted Vegetable Flatbread and the Candy House Salad from the Gluten Sensitive menu.  Both were delicious.  Gluten free crust is usually kind of gluey and disappointing, but the flatbread was light and fluffy. The kitchen was able to accommodate my requests for light cheese on the flatbread and no walnuts on the salad with no problems.  Everything tasted really fresh.  The portion sizes were generous without being overwhelming.  The menu is very resonably priced, especially considering that the food is obviously made with really good quality ingredients.  The big standout for me was the calibre of service.  Our waitress was attentive without being intrusive.  She was very friendly and knowledgeable, and seemed genuinely enthusiastic about the restaurant and the menu offerings. Our drinks were kept full, and our bill arrived promptly when requested.  I have encountered a lot of pretty mediocre service in Toronto restaurants lately, and Union Social was a refreshing change.  I recommend making reservations.  We went at 5:30 on a Wednesday night and it was quite busy."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and amazing food at an affordable price. Good place for date nights! Only downside to my eating experience was that the manager said that the brownie was on the house but instead charged me for it without informing me whatsoever. I never knew it was on the bill until I left the restaurant. They did not provide any take out bags with the containers - had to wait an extra 30 mins after paying the bill to get the bag."}
{"text":"Pretty decent hangout in the St clair area. The firecracker appetizer was absolutlely delicious!   Sadly, the rest of the meal didn't live up to expectations. I'd strongly recommend staying away from the Philly steak Naan wrap. Maybe mine was an exception,  but it was way way too salty. It felt like they salted each component individually and neglected to account for that fact when they put them all on the same plate.    My girlfriend's fish burger was fairly average, though she found the fish overcooked and dry.  Great selection of beers on tap, though cocktails are a bit of a hit and miss.  Overall, a decent place to catch the game but nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"The place has excellent customer service. Nice decoration and it is nice to eat here, grab a beer or watch a sports game. The menu is very interesting but the food is just OK, not bad but nothing spectacular, prices are OK"}
{"text":"Great balance between portion and presentation. Reasonable prices and delicious dishes all topped off by friendly and accessible service. Fried pickles are among the best in the city!"}
{"text":"Just dined here for the first time today and gave their summerlicious menu a chance, and man am I glad i did!  For my starter i chose the short ribs firecrackers (pretty much egg rolls) - came with 2, which was the perfect size  Main - Steak sandwich. Definitely the most juicy and tender steak i've ever had the chance to eat   Dessert - mint chocolate ice cream sandwich. It was amazing!!! But halfway through I couldn't finish it. It eventually got overwhelming sweet, but if you're into that then go for it!  I loved it here, our server was attentive and food was spectacular.  Mark my words I WILL BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"Good hangout spot for lunch and gets too busy.  Some good healthy alternatives. I ordered their tacos first time and they were just meh. I did however like the fettuccine pasta and the swordfish burger ( does have a little fishy taste) .  Their salads are also quote good and filling"}
{"text":"A very good casual dinner with top ingredients and craftsmanship. They had a decent beer selection, an attentive staff, and an eclectic mix of music. The housemade chive vinegarette for the salad was outstanding. I ordered the burger and found the right mix of beef to bun, a nice crust with plenty of juice. I would recommend this place and will be back on my next trip."}
{"text":"Stopped by late sat night. Our server was the best. She gave us samples to try of the beers we were interested in before having them poured."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my boyfriend. The appetizers we ordered were amazing - we had a pulled pork poutine and their house salad. Unfortunately, the mains that we ordered were not.   I ordered their steak and mash potatoes (which I had instead of fries) which was their most expensive main priced at $23. I was quite disappointed to receive a huge plate with food covering only 20% of the plate and no veggies. The steak was way undercooked, and it was obvious that the meat was not fresh since it was extremely difficult to slice thru. We felt bad about flagging down the waiter for this, but it wasn't edible.. I was having a hard time swallowing it. Instead of switching the steak to a fresher piece, the waiter offered to cook it for longer which we had no choice but to agree to. The manager brought it back out to us, and it was a little better but you can't really change anything about meat that isn't fresh.   Overall, it was a disappointing end to the meal"}
{"text":"Just finished lunch sitting at the bar,  and Sam took great care of us.  Service is always great here.  The food is not like a normal chain restaurant.  It is always fresh and homemade.  My wife and I come here fairly often and we decided the team here deserved a great review."}
{"text":"I believe this place has the best burgers in the city. The service is usually satisfactory (no one would accuse this place of being fast, even at the best of times). The main issue with the restaurant is that it is extremely loud. Due to is last fact, my wife and I usually order take out these days.   Today the service was exceptionally slow. Due in no small part to the bartender who was in shift today. I witnessed several people waiting for 10 minutes or more for a simple drink. I myself was required to wait 30 minutes (in addition to the expected 20 minutes). Apparently there was some mixup with my order and as a result, my wife's entree was not included. In an attempt to prove that the error was not his, the bartender decided it was a good idea to go digging into the garbage to find the paper record of the order. The first time he did this, he managed to half heartedly was his hands before returning to making drinks. The second time he dug into the garbage he thought better of the washing and returned directly to serving customers.  After sitting at the bar for 30 minutes with my entree, my wife's food was ready. At least her food was somewhat hot when I arrived home. The same could not be said for mine.  Ordinarily this place is one of our favorites, but today left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Only 4 because I can't give 3.5.  Rooftop is beautiful and food was ok as was service. Nothing particularly bad but nothing particularly good either.  We got a soup that we spilt. Was not offensive but i would not order t again. Some kind of chicken rice soup. And we each got a sandwich. Both were good but again not great. Was a nice atmosphere and wait staff was decent."}
{"text":"Overall impression: \"meh\".  Food is fine (Caesar salad dressing is WAY too garlicky), service is fine, cocktails/beer/wine are fine.   Utterly unremarkable."}
{"text":"Great spot! Would never recognize the place given the location and tinted windows in the front. nice ambiance. Almond crusted chicken was really good and the fish and chips were quite nice! great selection of craft beers as well."}
{"text":"Just a heads up, this location isn't doing Summerlicious!! I was quite disappointed as I called in earlier the day of, asking if this location is serving the Summerlicious menu (I assumed it wasn't since it wasn't listed - only the Toronto location is officially on the list) but the server on the phone said that they are, so I made a reservation for 2. However when we arrived, and after we were seated our server informed us that it's only the Toronto location participating (after double checking with the kitchen)... not impressed by the communication between staff at all.   Since we were already there it's not like we were going to leave, so we ordered the BBQ Short Rib Poutine to start off. This poutine was delicious!! The short ribs strips melted in your mouth and the fried onion strips added crispy texture to the dish. A definite must try to share! (one could feed 4 people for an appetizer trust me).  For the main, I had the Chicken Rose Penne, which was very creamy and filling. The chicken was a little dry but the broccoli and peppers with the sauce worked very well together. As my friend and I were quite full, we shared the Peach Creme Brulee for dessert. The sugar layer was on the thick side and I did not enjoy the peach custard at all.. it made it taste like peach yogurt... meh.   This place was quite busy for a Tuesday night and our server was clearly rushing for us to leave (even though we were only there for 1.5 hours.. which isn't bad at all in my opinion). Overall, the food was tasty (the appetizer was hands down the highlight of the night) but my personal experience with the restaurant and staff was not exactly pleasant."}
{"text":"Almost everything you order here is great! I'm not a fan of the truffle fries (way too much oregano-ruined it for me) but otherwise it is an impressive menu. Make sure to ask what the killer chicken sandwich is as it changes monthly. We were once asked to move spots to accommodate a big party(we didn't mind at all) and we're given dessert on the house. Awesome staff, great food and great drink specials!"}
{"text":"Food Quality & Price: Price is comparative to typical chain restaurants like Kelsey's or Montana's.  Our group tried a variety of items on the menu.  I was craving pasta so I gave the Spicy Chicken Rigatoni a shot.  I did not think that it was spectacular by any means.  The dish was not spicy at all (which was a disappointment) and overall the meal was only okay.   Facility: Ambiance and decor of the eatery were great.  It wasn't loud at all (as other reviews have mentioned) but then again, it was pretty empty when our large group went on a Saturday night in October. I liked the look and the washrooms were clean.  Service: I really liked the service at the Union Social.  It definitely brought the mark up.  All the waitresses were friendly, warm, and accommodating. I have nothing negative to say about the service and it carries the weight of this entire review.  Had the food reflected better, this would have easily been 4 stars.    Overall: I came to the Union Social with a large group. The restaurant was recommended by friends.  The overall experience was good, food was decent, service was excellent.  However, I would probably not set out to go to the Union Social on my own.  If I had friends or a group who wanted to go, I'd come back, but it was not enough to leave me wanting to return on my own accord."}
{"text":"Like my rating suggests above, \"I've experienced better\" Yes, the food is afforable, however it is mediocre. At my table, we ordered a burger, seared tuna salad, and a flatbread. We all shared our dishes with one another The flatbread looked amazing, taste was nothing special. Although it had many toppings, it was also covered in.. what seems to be just regular canned tomato sauce. They went a bit overboard with the balsamic dressing. The tuna was good, but who doesn't love a good seared tuna. However, because of its cheap price, we didnt get many pieces of tuna, and literally 1 fig (cut in quarters) to top it off. It was mostly leafy greens. Once again.. eh. Burger was alright, it wasn't horrible and I didn't personally hate it. However, it was served with some overly-salted fries.  Wait was a tad long for a weekday early (5:30 pm) dinner, but our waitress was kind and happy to help."}
{"text":"It's a neighbourhood restaurant with a downtown atmosphere, friendly service and a foodie menu.  Sounds like my type of place!    -Candied salad-was really cold-I mean like really cold.  I like my salads cool, but a little bit more room temperature would be better so I could taste the fig and mango better, but that's just me.    -The club flatbread was really good-thin and crisp, right amount of topping to crust ratio and $10 on a Saturday.    -Ahi Poke-is NOT like Hawaiian poke, but still tasty nonetheless.  Fresh tuna with soy, and a side of guacamole and baugette chips make a nice light app.    -Burger was rated as \"Really, really, good.  I mean well cooked and very juicy.  Not the best I've had, but pretty darn close!\"  Needless to say, next time I'll be ordering a burger!  It's a great neighbourhood addition and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Okkkkk.. lego with the Union Social Eatery.  Honestly.. I hesitated before going to this place.. I had always gone there while it was still Shopsy's to get that student discount. Still I decided to go. I went here with a couple of my friends throughout the hockey playoffs (leafs fail).   Food is proper. Real good.. Had the steak sandwich the first time and the steak and sushi combo the next. Both were surprisingly good. I was really surprised with the sushi... I was not expecting anything special.   Also.. waitress's doe. real nice."}
{"text":"The previous conditional pass made me a little uncomfortable but my friend and I went anyway. In our online reservation, we requested somewhere in the corner because we wanted to catch up... but when we got there, we were seated in the middle of the busy bar area! I had to request a corner table...again. Food was decent except the next morning my friend and I had to use the bathroom asap! Don't think I'd go back"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Saturday. The food was average. I had a burger with some fries and a soda. The fries was the best part of the meal. The service was not bad. I like the atmosphere of this place but I don't think I'm going to go back there. The whole thing was not worth it."}
{"text":"Picture Jack Astor's. Now picture something like that but MUCH better. There is a heavy attention to detail in every aspect of this place from the menu to the décor and it creates a great high end pub experience. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I went here last weekend for lunch for the first time. I heard a lot of great things about this place, and I can say from experience that they are all true!  First, a lot of people rave about the great service and now I know why. Our server was amazing. Friendly, helpful, attentive, very pleasant to talk to, she made us feel very welcomed and took the time to talk to us and answer questions.  Second, a lot of people mentioned the great food and I can honestly say the food is amazing. I had a cheeseburger and fries and it tasted fresh and delicious. It was cooked to perfection.  I really enjoyed the fries though the most. They were thin and crispy, but not burnt. So tasty! I was also impressed by the generous amount of fries they gave with the hamburger.   We also tried this chip and pita appetizer with dips. It tasted delicious as well.  I was also pleasantly surprised by how reasonable the prices were. While the prices are not cheap, for a nice restaurant with amazing food, I was expecting the prices to be a lot higher than they were.   My burger and fries for example was only $13.97. While that is pricey when compared to say fast food, this is a few dollars cheaper than some sit down restaurants.  I finally want to add one more thing, but I was debating whether I should include this in my review. Our server found out that this was our first time here and so she gave us a sample appetizer on the house to welcome us. We thought that was so nice of them! This is just another example of the excellent service that they provide. They really go above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience. They gave us this pork appetizer and it tasted amazing.   I wasn't sure I wanted to mention the fact that we got free food in this review because one, I don't know if this is a regular thing they do and I don't want people coming here for the first time to expect to get free food like we did. Second, I don't want people thinking that I gave them 5 stars because they gave us a free appetizer. I would have given them 5 stars even without this very nice gesture.  Anyways, I am so glad that I tried this place and I am so excited to come back and try more great food with incredible service!"}
{"text":"Good vibes, polite staff. Please note that the philly steak wrap is really salty so if you don't like that, avoid it (:   Their birthday specials consists of having the staff sing happy birthday to you with a candle on top (but make sure to remind the staff again because they forgot it about it for me lol)   Also when making reservations, ask for a booth table because the non-booth tables are not spacey, there was barely any place to put our food on the table..  Other than that it's a decent place and decent staff."}
{"text":"First time here.  Great food,big portion. Will definitely come back.  Love their fries come with the dishes, they are not frozen fries.  The size of the fish in the Fish&Chip is big (long as the knife).  Almond crusted chicken tenders is amazing."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on a trip to the Toronto airport. Fantastic food and atmosphere.  Wish it was closers so I could go again!"}
{"text":"Good food and service. I had a burger with truffle fries, and my wife had a spinach salad. Place is big, clean, and had good music. Will be back."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp.  Really nice place inside. Great service. Great food.   Everything sounded fantastic on the menu so it was hard to decide. Ended up getting a burger with a few different types of cheeses on it (don't remember the name) - it was awesome! So delicious. The hamburger patty actually  tasted like they make them in house and isn't some premade patty. They also had a gluten free bun option. Probably the best GF hamburger bun I've ever had.   Even better than the burger, which is hard to top, were the truffle fries. Amazing! Do not leave here without trying them.   I will definitely be going back the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Service good.  Ordered: chicken taquitos, Philly cheesesteak naan and chicken vindaloo - bland and terrible."}
{"text":"Decided to finally try this place today at lunch.  Firstly, when we mentioned it was our first time the general manager Esther came out to say hello and offered us a free appetizer, the House Braised Short Rib Firecrackers - which were delicious!  We ordered fairly straightforward mains, I had a burger my SO had chicken fingers and both exceeded our expectations.  Plus they have daily drink specials and it just so happened our favourite beer was the special of the day, so that was a nice bonus.  We will definitely be going back, great atmosphere, great service and really good food."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a Sunday. It was not busy at all. The waitstaff were kind and service was great. The menu had a ton of great options for both food and drink specials. I chose the French toast and it was delicious! Everyone at our table enjoyed their food as well. It came out relatively quick and was hot. The decor in the restaurant is really nice as well. We would definitely return here!"}
{"text":"I can't complain about this place. They ensure the customer is a priority which reflects on the clientele that keeps returning.   Well knowledged in mixology and ensures the client returns again. Won't be disappointed with their strong interpersonal and soft skills.  Great job!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing!  That is once I passed the hostess station.  Came here with friends and they vouched it was a good place, plus my friend's husband and friends wanted to watch The Davis Cup (tennis).  I trusted my friend's opinion as she loves food as much as I do and lives in the area.  I rarely venture north of Bloor as I'm a SOB (South of Bloor) lady, but occasionally would meet friends north of the downtown core so it's not a surprise that this restaurant has been opened for over a year and I have yet to pay a visit. I was happy I finally did.  Upon entering, the hostess was not very friendly at all, plus even gave my friend attitude when she said reservation under her husband's name (and he already called earlier to confirm our reservation and was given attitude as well).  One would expect the hostess would be all smiles and welcoming, but not even close.  She looked miserable and had the air that we were bothering her and this was before 6pm!  So imagine when the dinner rush started arriving?  The restaurant was about 65% at capacity when we arrived  It was really unfortunate when it was her job to welcome us to the restaurant and first impression is important.  One star should be taken off just for her attitude because it was that bad, but I'm forgiving as the rest of the dining experience was absolutely fabulous.  The restaurant  consisted of many booths and high-top tables by the bar area, plus a little enclave section at the back.  Decor looks more like an upscale sports bar to me that included a bar fully stocked with many beers on tap and a decent wine selection.  There were four large flat screens above the bar area so all the booths were semi-circle that it faced the TVs.  The servers were all friendly and attentive without being overbearing.  They were available when we needed them and even one server that wasn't serving us, thanked us for dining with them.  Service was definitely friendly inside the dining area which makes up for the lack of service at the front door.  Menu was pretty varied with a selection for everyone's palate.  I had a hard time deciding on what to order, so luckily for me my friend is the sharing kind.  The men had their own meals and I cannot comment on it, except it looked nicely presented.  They all said their food was tasty, so will have to try their orders next time.  The fact that we were close to the kitchen by the bar, we saw everything come out and it all looked delicious to me.  I was definitely impressed with all the food and the best part was all the food was under $20.  The  portions were generous with prices that matched the quantity and quality. Although, some of the prices were oddly priced that you normally don't see on menus i.e. $5.46,  $10.93, $11.19, $13.23, $13.64, $15.22 - who came up with the pricing?  In addition, daily drink specials were available.  Since it was Friday, we had their $15 pitcher of domestic beer. What a deal!  We ordered the following to share:  Korean short rib soft tacos $9.98:  3 tacos - short rib was so tender that it just melted in the mouth and every bite was nice and savoury  Grilled swordfish soft tacos $11.87: 3 tacos -  fish was fresh and flaky plus the wasabi napa slaw added a nice kick, but it wasn't overpowering  BBQ short rib poutine $9.98 - looked like a mess, but the short rib was so flavourful and the crispy onions added a nice texture to the mixture that just burst with flavours in your mouth.    5 Napkin burger with spinach salad $15.64:  it was ginormous and we wondered how are we going to eat that!  It was a tower of meaty mess that was stacked nicely.  No wilted pieces for the baby spinach salad and it was just simply fresh tasting with the light herb cider vinaigrette   Creme brulee $4.95:  classic variety with biscotti on the side.  You know it's a good creme brulee when you hear the crackle when the spoon hits the top and the custard just melts in your mouth  Chocolate chunk cookies $4.95: 3 warm cookies served with vanilla ice cream.  Simple as it can get and so tasty.  Overall, an absolute amazing dining experience and I cannot wait to go back to try some of the other food.  Am thinking it'll finally be worth my while to go north of Bloor without having to go all the way to the Yonge & Eglinton area."}
{"text":"This was an awesome experience. The food was great,there are a ton of seats, and the service was top notch.   I"}
{"text":"We had Sunday brunch here today and it was great.   Four of us had steak and eggs, two had burgers.   The service was awesome.  The steaks were a had tough, otherwise they would have received 5 stars.  They may wish to add omlettes on Sunday too."}
{"text":"We live in the area, but it was our first time here. We really enjoyed the upstairs outdoor patio sooooo much! Our waitress was awesome, and the manager Jack came by to greet us and chatted with us and welcomed us, which we appreciated so much! That kind of personal touch is so nice and rare. He shows a lot of pride in the menu and I love coming to places where the employees are proud of their employment.  Thank you so much and we will be back soon as long as there isn't a lineup for the fabulous rooftop patio!"}
{"text":"Great spot in mississauga.  One of the few nice spots in peel region.  Chicken sandwiches are always great."}
{"text":"First time here. Service and atmosphere were great. The chicken tacos was a bit too tangy, but the burger and the firecracker (short rib mix in wonton wrap) was delicious. Portions generous."}
{"text":"Poor service. Very slow to come with the food and the bill. The salads were definitely not worth it. Something I could make by myself. The herbed spinach salad did not even have marinated grape tomatoes that was listed on the menu. In addition, the burgers we had were dry. The almond crusted chicken strips were bland and tasteless. Would not come again or recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend for dinner on a Thursday night. It was surprisingly packed inside, however there was one table available and we were promptly seated. We tried the parmesan truffle fries for our starter. They were pretty good, however the fries/portion itself seemed to be quite small. I tried the blackened chicken bowties. It was a good pasta dish, however I felt like it could have used more chicken. My girlfriend had the Philly steak naan wrap. She liked it a lot. I would have given this 5 stars however our server was not very attentive or friendly and seemed to be paying more attention to the tables around us.  Good restaurant with a busy vibe, would come back again."}
{"text":"My brother and I decided to have lunch here before he started work and this was one of the closest option. The place was not as busy with many empty tables which was good because we got a seat and our food at a reasonable time and the server was really energetic and friendly. The nacho's are definitely one of the best I had, we ordered the chicken nachos, the nachos were double layered, the chicken at the bottom and another layer of nachos with toppings on it (see picture). However the poutine looked and tasted unusual, the gravy and the chedder cheese on the poutine was not the best, I would just order the fries next time as they were fairly good or the truffle fries according to yelp reviews. Unfortunately this place is far from where I live but I would definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Went for a girls brunch on a weekend and the restaurant wasn't packed at all. The pub serves American pub fare In a clean, nicely spaced dining area.   The service was professional, and even though they forgot my order and I had to wait while my table received theirs, the client manager apologized for the fact and offered it as a free meal. They did an excellent job on the customer service front. (4/5)  However, when it came to the food, I had the Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon. The English muffin broke apart easily and was soggy from the sauce. The side was a large mounds of potatoes that didn't have much flavour to it. Granted, there may be other items on the menu which are better, that I didn't have a chance to try. (2/5)   So overall I gave it a 3 star on average between the two qualities for my first experience. I don't think I would come back unless my friends really wanted to meet here in which I would chose some different items on the menu to try it out."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food & staff! Ordered the Bahn Mi Grilled Chicken Tacos, garlic shrimp tacos, and the mars bar brownie. The tacos were absolutely amazing and would definitely 100% recommend! I still think about those tacos often and constantly crave them (especially the Bahn Mi tacos).  The brownie was also extremely delicious if you have a big sweet tooth like myself.   Our waitress was so kind and welcoming and definitely made an effort to get to know us.   Amazing service- quality ingredients... will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Our 1st time, roof top patio is clean, casual  and cozy. Our server was very friendly and polite. Mediterranean dip was fantastic! The salad was decent  but the burger & fries they said made in-house and it really was! We got medium and it was very juicy. Big portion on the fries.   Julian the manager was very attentive and made our experience.  We will definitely come back again with friends and family."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying if you want good service, head over to Union Social! The staff here are super friendly and very accommodating. I can't recall the last time I had servers that were this awesome. The manager even came by and sat down with us for a little while and had a good chat with our group.   Came here with a group of 8 and we were able to get a reservation in on a Saturday night. The place was pretty packed already. We were hoping to have the Raptors game on in our seating area but there was a group who got there before us who insisted on watching the Leafs in a different room The feeds go to certain TVs so they weren't able to change them individually, which kinda sucked.   Ordered apps to share including Nachitos, short rib tacos, truffle fries and firecrackers. The truffle fries came out a bit too soggy but everything else was good. The Nachitos were fully loaded. They definitely didnt skimp out on toppings.   I also ordered the Chicken Rose Penne. DELICIOUS. The portion size was huge. Lots of chicken strips in the pasta also with broccoli and goat cheese. Yummm.   $5 pints of Sleeman every Saturday. They also have lots of beer on tap and in bottles.   I'd like to come back and try the almond crusted chicken next time!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere with a wooden theme. It has a feel of a modernize 80's eatery.  The music was not too loud.   I started with the roasted pepper soup which was a nice appetizer size. It could have been just a bit warmer, but it was tasty and did not feel very heavy.  The spinach salad was topped with beats, goat cheese and sweetened walnut crumbles. The sweet walnut complimented the salty goat cheese really well.  The burger was juicy with a few touch of meyo and mustard on the bun. Very tasty for the price! ( $11 )."}
{"text":"Service is pretty good, food is good for what is essentially bar food (almond battered chicken). Location is very close to the 401."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, iv been there several times, its just it takes a pretty long time for the food to arrive."}
{"text":"Yummy food and great service. Went for lunch with friends and was very happy with this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, even better and cheaper than Holy Chuck around the corner. This is the place I bring people who visit me from out of town and they are always impressed."}
{"text":"We've eaten almost everything on this menu by now and haven't found a single thing we didn't love. They also have great service. Definitely one of my favourite places!"}
{"text":"We happened to stop by on our way home, we were well greeted by the friendly staff, seated and were approached by the owner/manager who upon hearing that it was our first visit brought over a complementary appetizer.   Urban Social has a very Earthy atmosphere where the food is fresh and handmade. We ordered the Steak Frites. It was the perfect quantity and made exactly the way wanted it. It was amazing!   Urban Social Eatery is well worth the visit and has definitely found two new long term customers."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming to this location with a group of friends and it was definitely worth the try. We didn't have to wait too long for a table as the restaurant was not busy at around 8:30 p.m.  I ordered the Herb Brie Chicken which arrived at the table within 20 minutes. Overall, the chicken was quite moist and very delicious, which I would probably order again for next time.   Although the restaurant was very quiet at the time, our server for the evening was excellent and very attentive. The overall atmosphere was quiet, but again it was not very busy at that time. Would recommend this restaurant preferably for a large group of guests of 7 or more."}
{"text":"I go here probably once a month. The food and drinks are consistently good. I would definitely recommend going here!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere after work sitting with a larger group in the bar area was exactly what would be expected - it was loud, people were sharing food, and lots of laughs .  I went for the ahi tuna saved with a spinach salad.  the tuna was seared perfectly and was very high quality by the colour and the texture, but there was not a lot on the salad, so I needed more food when I hot home.  For a beverage I went for a Red Stripe served the only way it should be - straight out of the stubby!  As my team will be working in he area for the next few weeks I'm sure there will be more visits.  As with prior visits the staff were attentive and we were able to reserve some bar seating in advance for our group."}
{"text":"I've come to this place a few times over the years for lunch with coworkers and friends. I've since moved away but it's still a great lunch time spot when I'm back visiting. The place takes regular bar and lunch food and makes it a bit classier, with some Asian-inspired dishes too.   The food is reasonably priced (around $20$-30 per person, possibly less) and there's a unique set of appetizers and entrees. The crunchy BBQ chicken tacos and the almond-crusted chicken tenders are delicious - very crunchy and moist. The fries are very delicious too and well-seasoned, but can be subbed for an equally delicious creamy garlic Caesar salad...   Service is fast and friendly with daily soup specials. Waiters seem to be well trained on the food.   Seating area is open and well-lit, and seating is quite comfortable. Tons of parking, and close to highways and many offices. They also accept reservations by phone and via OpenTable which I love.   It's a great place for casual yet delicious lunch with family, work, or friends."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend, yeah I have a girlfriend. We decided to come here because we'd alway pass it and honestly that sign pulls people in. We went while they were playing the bluejays in the playoffs and it wasn't that packed as expected. We ordered crispy calamari, chicken penne rose, and wait for it...... BANH MI TACOS!! We were probably more excited for these tacos. Before our stuff came out I believe the manager came and greeted us and presented us firecracker pulled beef rolls, honestly I forgot what it was but it was like pulled beef, cream cheese and some other stuff in there, and I don't mind free food haha! It was pretty good I wouldn't lie to you guys. Anyways our food came and we digged right in, crispy calamari was mediocre tastes the same as any where else, penne rose was pretty bomb, but honestly we were more excited about these banh mi TACOS, and as 2 oriental people, an oriental couple we love our banh mi, it was pretty bomb! Chicken tasted just like the chicken in a chicken banh mi. Overall the place is nice, staff were attentive, treated us great, food coulda been better but a solid 4 stars! Washrooms were pretty clean, I mean they were wet spots everywhere but it's cool, it smelt good and that's what matter!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now. I finally got to try this place, and can't say I am impressed. We came on a late Sunday afternoon (around 2PM). The interior is okay, they dimmed the lights so nothing really stood out. The lunch menu had a decent selection of burgers. They give you the option of upgrading the fries for salad / sweet potato fries / dragon roll. My friend ordered the mushroom melt burger, and I ordered the Thai chicken burger, both with fries. Upon ordering, we waited for our food to come out. At last, our food came out after 30 whole minutes...   We digged into the fries only to find that they were warm and dry. The Pattie in the mushroom melt was burnt.. what's worse was that half of the chicken in my burger was black... Even the hamburger buns were burnt. I felt like I was eating charcoal. I really don't understand how a restaurant can take 30 minutes only to serve completely burnt burgers and over cooked fries.    Please stay away. You will most definitely have a better burger from mcds."}
{"text":"So this is one of the most highly rated places on Yelp Mississauga... After eating here a few nights ago, I'm not sure I understand why. It wasn't bad, but it also wasn't particularly good.  I ordered the candy house salad (~ $10) with seared ahi tuna (+ $7). The salad sounded fantastic in writing (mixed greens, sugared walnuts, mango, fig, feta, roasted red peppers, maple-pommery vinaigrette) but the actual product was a bit disappointing - instead of the peppery and bitter greens needed to balance out the sweetness of the fruits, it was mostly romaine. The ahi addition was similarly disappointing - $7 for 4 small slices of sesame crusted-not-seared and flabby-not-firm tuna. My friends were equally unimpressed with their choices.  Probably the best part of the experience was the service. Our server was lovely. She was super friendly and proactive, without being overbearing. Watching and hearing the staff interact with each other and with the diners, it seemed like they were genuinely happy to be there.  Considering the food and the service/ambience, it averaged out to an okay experience."}
{"text":"Had dinner alone at the bar. The staff were great and attentive...bartender a Letterkenny fan...how great is that.  I ordered dinner and when i said i wasnt happy with it she wisked it away and got me another entree. No fuss no muss. Filled my glass, got me some fries while i waited and all was right with the pasta! Professional staff and friendly place. Will be back."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Large patio, tons of seating inside with 2 floors. Great drink specials. Ordered the Korean short rib tacos (3/5), Nachitos with chicken (4.5/5), and Beef Poutine (4/5). Great place for drinks and food, fun vibe. Tacos were nothing special, beef was dry."}
{"text":"Good menu, different than your typical pub/bar restaurant food. I loved their salads for having some unique ingredients! ambience is nice when it's busy, and still enjoyable even if not. Good amount of seating available most nights."}
{"text":"Everything here is made fresh. We had the smokehouse burger and the almond crusted chicken tenders. Both were delicious. The chicken came with three sauces, but the ranch was the best. Had the cheesecake for dessert and it was also delicious. Would definitely come back. The service and the atmosphere were also great."}
{"text":"The great thing about this restaurant/bar is the drink selection. The variety is numerous and the prices are more than reasonable.   The food on the other hand, leaves a lot to desire. We ordered a variety of starters, including the truffle fries, the buffalo chicken tacos, sirloin firecrackers and the Mediterranean dip trio. The tacos were the only decent bite I got throughout the entire experience. The truffle fries were just covered in raw thyme and there was not a single hint of actual truffles. The firecrackers were decent, but the combination of sweet chilli sauce and the creamy mushroom sauce was odd. The Mediterranean dip trio should be renamed. The plate consisted of three dips (hummus, sun dried tomato and olive) which were served with pita and tortilla chips. Who puts tortilla chips on the plate and claims it to be a Mediterranean Meza plate?  My judgement is that Union Social only does well because the drinks are cheap and they have big screens for game viewing."}
{"text":"My go to joint .. place has a great vibe .. always busy but they have great staff to look after the customers .. they have daily specials each day if the week so you are never out of options"}
{"text":"Rave reviews of the Mississauga location had me wanting to try USE. Came here on a Thursday night after work with plenty of seating available.  Service was bad from the start. Felt rushed the entire night from ordering the initial drink to the meal. There just over an hour and the bill was brought to the table without us asking for it.  Friend and I both ordered burgers- good nothing spectacular.  I won't be returning to this location but might give the Mississauga location a try."}
{"text":"We had some family in from the UK, as well as my parents and they all wanted to watch the World Cup final, so we went to Union. The staff and management ( mark ) were awesome and recognized our every need. I felt bad tho, as other people showed up late for their reservation( silly to think that's ok) and were being rude to the staff and management . The place was packed solid, yet our glasses were never empty and the service was flawless! Thank you mark and team! Btw, our UK friends loved the place"}
{"text":"Liked the wine selection. Had valpolicella and Sauvignon blanc from Ontario. Steak frites were great. Saw some other cool dishes I would like to try. Will come back soon.  T was great and not impatient tho busy. But that's the name of the game."}
{"text":"Great daily deals on drinks. Loved my grilled swordfish tacos. Service was timely and pleasant. Will return."}
{"text":"Despite numerous positive reviews, Union Social Eatery is perhaps a fancier version of Jack Astors down the street.  I came in for a late lunch on Saturday and was seated promptly by the friendly staff. Most patrons seem to be watching the game at the bar.   I was starving and ordered a turkey sandwich, the Ace High Club or something on their menu. It took some time to arrive and just looking at it, my taste buds did not have high expectations. The Ciabatta bun ripped the roof of my mouth and the bacon in the sandwich was not crispy but instead cold and slimy tasting. Lettuce in my sandwich didn't look fresh either.. The mountain of fries on the side was pretty good though. They remind me of Swiss Chalet fries.  I asked if they had iced coffee and our server said no but could make one anyways. Just a suggestion, DONT do it. The iced coffee was probably the worst tasting coffee I've ever had - extremely watered down and tasted like nothing, all for over $2. I don't blame them though, it really wasn't on the menu.   Overall, service was good. The servers were all very professional and friendly. I may need to give other items on their menu a shot.."}
{"text":"Union Social Eatery is my lunch spot for the Mississauga Rd/401 area.  The burgers are made with real beef no fillers and the fries are wonderful.  Union is tucked away in the food mall as I call it where many corporate offices are located in North Mississauga.  This place gets busy during lunch and after work; reservations are recommended.  The rest of their menu is decently priced as well tasty!  Check this place out if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers!!!! I tried tha day special with rugula and brie cheese and it's amazing"}
{"text":"Good food, but exceptional service.  Korean tacos were really good, and the fries might actually be the same ones In-N-Out Burger uses.  ...but what really stuck out was really excellent service. When the manager overheard that we'd never been there before, she brought out a sampler tray of their appetizer dips to let us try them out. Servers were attentive but not pushy.  Solid list of local and major-label beers."}
{"text":"I've heard and read rave reviews about the burger so I was super excited to try that. Frankly, I've had better. I can appreciate the burger was a good quality and cut of beef and the grind was nicely coarse and loosely packed (just as all good burgers should be), but the burger was overcooked. The server said it would be medium well, but it was definitely past well done. It was consequently dry. First couple bites were tolerable, but the last two-thirds of the patty were very dry.   Also, it had a distinct lack of seasoning. I'm not talking about \"meatloaf burger\" seasoning. I'm just talking about plain old salt and pepper. I had to salt the burger patty and I usually never salt food at restaurants (I usually find foods a little too salty at restaurants). Perhaps the chef on duty that day just forgot to season my food. I don't know. Even the fries were lacking in seasoning. Pretty odd.   The fries were the thin shoestring cut type. Just a personal preference, but I'm not really a fan of those. They get cold and hard pretty quickly and it's difficult to get that ideal contrast between crispy exterior and soft potatoey interior when the fry is cut so thin."}
{"text":"Food: Ordered bacon cheeseburger for lunch with Ceasar salad. Burger was hot and juicy. bacon was crispy.   Service: We were seated quickly. waitress was prompt and attentive, checking on us a on several occasions and topped up drinks.  Decor: Updated decor. clean. chairs were comfortable.  Would I come back? Yes."}
{"text":"Make sure to get the smashed avocado when you're here! The food here has yet to disappoint and they are very accommodating when I let them know I was gluten free they brought me a very extensive gluten sensitive menu! It is really loud though so don't go expecting to have intimate conversations with your dining partner!"}
{"text":"First time here and was excited as I've heard only but good things. I got the braised rib firecrackers to start...amazing! Loved it.   Grabbed three short rib tacos for lunch, they were very good as well however I have had better tacos in the city. I know it's not fair to compare but what can you do. It's my review.  Service was very good, the server took her time to explain the menu and provide good recommendations, even though it was jam packed for lunch.   Highly recommend a visit. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"First time here with my friend. They sat us at a huge booth which was awesome because there was only 2 of us. Our waiter was super friendly and awesome. We both got burgers which were so good and the fries were awesome too. Excellent service, I would go back just to get that server again! haha."}
{"text":"Great premium-casual style restaurant in a more suburban part of Mississauga. I took my team from work here for a post-field trip dinner and it was a good choice. Safe menu with lots of traditional pub-fare options as well as a few more interesting main dishes.  The atmosphere was casual but chic, similar to Earl's. Food was also quite good, the group ordered a variety of items including a spinach salad, burger and fish and chips. I had a panang curry bowl which was very good although could've been better if it came with shrimp instead of chicken. The only complaint from the rest of the group was the chicken on the salad was colder than desired but could have been a one off.  Didn't study the drink menu as they had a good beer special.  Lastly - value for money was very good. On the cheaper side for premium-casual dining, dinner and a drink ran under $25 with tax and tip.   Would probably not command a full 5 star rating in downtown Toronto but a great location if you find yourself in North Western Mississauga."}
{"text":"The service is wonderful, but the steak frites is horrible. I asked for Medium Rare and they made it Medium Well. I would just stick to the chicken tenders and the salads."}
{"text":"A little pricey for what it is but it's good food. I'd be going more often if their prices were lower or they at least had specials. Nonetheless, overall this place is good."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, they sat as on the raised part beside the bar, so no big deal but we were right beside the door and I'm listening to all the waiters and waitresses and hostesses GOSSIP about each other, it was so unprofessional. A waiter walked by us 5 TIMES before a hostess whispered these exact words \"they've been waiting for like 10 minutes...\" HELL YA WE WERE.   Food was pretty good actually, the park fries are a definite must. Fish and chips mediocre but the chicken strips and the candy salad were so good! Kinda pricey but pretty worth it."}
{"text":"Talk about a place that goes above and beyond. From walking in we had all of the hostesses greet us soo nicely. It took a couple minutes to see if there was space on the patio but they were very apologetic fot the wait and everyone seemed genuinely kind. The rooftop patio is definitely the best reason to visit this place. Its a great environment with awesome music, fireplace and nice booths. First time experience we were greeted by a number lf staff members and while I could tell it was a routine they do for all first time visits it definitely felt genuine and made this a place I need to return to! Hopefully we still get the kind welcome next time ;)  we tried the veggie firecracker which was delicious, very cheesy. And the smashed avocado dip was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on a Friday night for date night with the hubby.   Atmosphere inside reminded us of restaurants in Toronto. Oh how I miss Toronto.   We were greeted and asked if we have made reservations and we said no, but they were still able to sit us right away. We sat on those tall tables, it wasn't the best seat in the house but the chair was comfortable.   Our waitress was lovely. She was new but she did a great job by being personable and still professional by reciting the specials right away.   We ordered calamari with beer and chai tea to start. Then a manager came by with our calamari and another dish. Our waitress had told her that it was our first time, so they treated us to one of their starter dish called \"Firecracker\".   OMG that dish was DELICIOUS! It actually overpowered our calamari dish. Look up the menu and read what is in it cause I don't know what it is but if was freaking delicious.   I ordered the Killer chicken special and hubby ordered club sandwich. Both were really good, but my dish was waaaay better than hubby's.   But I was so full from the calamari and firecracker that I couldn't finish it.   I am still thinking of that firecracker dish. Mmmmm"}
{"text":"Described to me as \"a hipster's Jack Astor's\" by a friend, I was a little bit nervous about coming here.  After our initial visit, I'd be more inclined to compare it to a pub.   We shared a beef rib poutine: fries covered with a house-made, creamy gravy, green onions, a sprinkling of grated cheese, and a pile of shredded ribs.  Was glad that I ordered a side of gravy (for an extra $2) for my entree fries, cause their gravy is pretty yummy!  Really discernible from that brown powder/water mix stuff.   Had a bit of an unfortunate hiccup (henceforth known as \"the hiccup\") for those of us that ordered burgers in finding bits of hard bone/cartilage in our house-ground patties, but they were tasty otherwise.  My cheeseburger had a thick and juicy patty, covered in melted cheese and topped with fresh slices of tomato & lettuce.  Was happy to eat almost all of the large portion of shoestring fries that accompanied the burger.   I have to say, most impressive of the night was the way that management and staff handled everything when we told them about the bones.  The server was really, really nice and attentive as was the manager.  I chose the Candy House salad with seared tuna as a replacement (comped at the end) which was four slices of seared tuna on lettuce with sweetened walnuts and feta cheese.  It was good too, but if I were to order again I'd still opt for a burger.  On our way home, my partner mentioned that aside from the hiccup, he very much enjoyed his burger and hopes to go back and try again."}
{"text":"If you go there for drinks, it's okay but I absolutely wouldn't go there for the food. It just isn't good.   For example, I had the Penne pasta with chicken (supposedly a popular item). While the pasta was okay, the chicken in it was the most bland, dry and unappetizing chicken ever. The chicken tasted like something that had been reheated.   I also tried the chicken wings. They were edible but I would give them a 3/10. These 2 courses I took were supposedly popular items. One positive about this establishment is that they have Sapporo beer on tap."}
{"text":"|| Must Try: Tacos and Sliders  || Rating: (8/10) Food, (11/10) Service, (8/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (9/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness  || My Experience:     First off, this place is hands down the best service I've ever had at any establishment. The manager Mike was extremely helpful accommodating our large party over the phone and, moreover, remembered us and helped facilitate our party when we arrived. Extremely friendly service and care for their customers. That alone would make me come back again.   This place us great for groups. The appetizer size is good for about two individuals and the mains are a hefty portion. We had the steak and frites, which were great, but the appetizers of tacos and sliders were the highlight of the meal.   I would highly recommend this for a large celebration or gathering! Had a great time and will be a returning costumer without a doubt!"}
{"text":"While service and setting was good, my brunch was very disappointing. I had the smoked salmon eggs benedict and it was subpar at best. The hollandaise sauce seemed dried up at the top and the yolk wasn't runny at all, it was fully cooked and dry. I will definitely won't order it again and hesitant to come back."}
{"text":"Very poor service....vil never recommend or visit again. I wish I could give zero star to this place."}
{"text":"This is a great spot if you want the quality food and service without having to battle the Gardiner to get downtown.   It's located in the business area of Mississauga in a plaza that has a plethora of parking.   The ambience reminds me moxies style. The service is great, all of the staff is helpful and attentive.  The food is very good, their menu is all under $20.00. The portions are also great. Not too much and not too little.   The time that I went was on New Year's Eve and it was not too crowded in there especially considering the day. They have strong flavours and a lot of different menu options.   Great food, great location! I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner.   I've been to the location in Mississauga so I e had prior experience with the brand before. This new location was pumping with great ambience, the service was on par and the decor, much like the others was nicely decorated. The only thing that was lacking was unfortunately the food...which I'm sure will likely improve once the kitchen staff gets the hang of the dishes.   Comparable to the Mississauga location it was lacking in that department.   We ordered the rib poutine which was probably my favourite. My neighbour ordered the calamari, which was upsetting. It was very bland. I also had a caesar that I asked for \"spicy\" and was pretty watered down. My main course was the banana coconut chicken. Presentation wise, nothing special, as it looked like something I could make at home. Taste it was a little less bland compared to the other items. But nothing that blew me away.   I guess it's what to expect for dishes under 20.00!  I think I'll come back once they get the rhythm flowing here.  Overall good everything! Just needs a little practice on the food!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place couple of time and its great! There is a lot of variety to choose from and all the food combination seems to be working.  Foodwise I have tried their yummy almond crusted chicken pieces, these things are addictive but are very blend and you will have to dip them in the 3 sauces they provide. The other thing I tired was banana coconut crusted chicken! I was hesitant in ordering this but the banana does go very well with the combination. And the last my favorite The sword fish burger... I love that thing! the sauteed onions go very well with the burger and their fries are too good.   The service is great and they try to be as quick as possible in getting people in and out of the place. It does get packed at lunch time on weekdays so make sure you have reservation. the staff is very friendly and makes sure we have a good time and checks back if we are ok.  The place is designed nicely, they have different kind of seatings and have TVs for sports as well.  Parking is not a problem as its part of a big plaza."}
{"text":"Yikes, food is overly greasy, very oily, not tasty, and super expensive. Very loud and cramp inside. The best thing of my meal was the grapefruit juice, but so small, I asked no ice to get better value of my drink."}
{"text":"I have now eaten at this restaurant a number of times and a pattern has emerged. No matter what I order without fail the food is excellent. But most of the time the service utterly fails on even the most basic level (except when we get Charlie).  On our most recent visit I spent twenty minutes looking longingly across the restaurant in the hopes of receiving a refill on my drink so I might continue my meal while it was still hot. Our server spent this time flitting here and there never once glancing in our direction.  I don't ask a lot. Bring me my food and fill my drink once. I'll be happy. Apparently that is too much to ask at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the club sandwich, hard item to screw up but when done right they can be great. In the case of Union they do a fantastic job making the club. Nice place great scenery and the waitress was great. Will go back."}
{"text":"Was in Toronto for the labor day week end. Dint know what and were to eat in this city so many choices! So we turned to your yelp app and found this place that was close to our hotel and the outlet mall. Was there for the lunch and had to trouble getting a table. I think is more of a night place to hangout with friends however there was a wide variety of dish we wanted to try. Service is quick and the plates were ready in no time."}
{"text":"Came here to watch game 4 of the second round for the raptors. Confirmed with the host that they would have the volume on and that there would be seats available with the view of the TV. They were very accommodating. The seating is comfortable and they have very big tables. Also really liked that you could get a view of the TV from almost any seat in the Restaurant.   It was three of us girls so we shared a bunch of apps: Buffalo butter chicken wings, calamari, and barbecue beef poutine. The poutine was by far the best, we had ordered it after we finished the wings and calamari so we were pretty full. Once the waitress set it down we cleaned the dish. It is so tasty. I saw a few mains pass by and regretted that we didn't order mains. Will be back again for it.   The Monday drinks special was $4 Corona and $4 primms and ginger. I had to have both x 2 and boy the Primms and ginger was very good."}
{"text":"Came here a couple times with co-workers as its right down the street. The fries were great, the servers were absolutely accommodating, but I do hate a bar with a long flight of stairs to get to a restroom. It always feels like someone's just not going to make it!  Other than that though, the atmosphere here is nice, open, welcoming. Not a great tequila selection (either Cuervo or Patron) but their social refresher 2.0 drink was, well, Refreshing! No ATM though :("}
{"text":"Tasty food and great service!! Overall an excellent experience!   Walked in with a group of co-workers (a total of 7 people). The manager saw us coming in from outside so he opened the door and held it open for us....how nice!! He was energetic and super nice...he cracked a few jokes and was very welcoming! Then the hostess set up a table for us right away.   Our server came within 2 minutes of sitting down and took drink orders. He wasn't as enthusiastic but still nice and efficient. He answered questions about the menu and just went straight to it! The food took about 20 minutes to arrive BUT there were 7 of us so it's understandable. Everyone's food came at the same time and everything was hot and fresh! And presentation of the food was spot on!  I ordered the almond crusted chicken fingers. It came with 5 big pieces and a mountain of fries! Portion was good! The chicken was hot, juicy and perfectly crusted with the right amount. I'm a huge French fry fan and these fries were soooo good! Thinly cut and super crispy! Their U.S.E. sauce is like a chipotle sauce, someone else at the table thought it was spicy but I didn't think so.   The rest of their menu looks really good so I'll have to come back and try something else!"}
{"text":"We had the Mediterranean dip, edamame, epic cheeseburger with poutine, and the mushroom melt burger (not sure if that was what it was called).  For drinks we had the special which was Rikards light ($5).  Edamame was over salted but good. The Mediterranean dip was smaller than expected but was enough for 4 people to share.  Burgers were cooked to medium well, juicy and full of beefy flavor.  You can tell they weren't the frozen premade patties many other chain restaurants use. The poutine was okay, gravy was quite good but the cheese was just grated cheddar cheese instead of cheese curds.   Our server Charles was excellent and very personable.  He seemed to really enjoy his job and made our visit extra enjoyable.   Overall great place to have food and drinks with friends.  Prices are very reasonable and the quality of food far exceeds the value."}
{"text":"I am totally biased as I love this chain - the first one I went to was this one at Yonge and St. Clair and I always had a good time.  Service is great and the seating is conducive for group gatherings. The food is really yummy especially all their various taquito dishes and let's not forget their Candy House Salad.   Since I work in the area, this is our work place's local jaunt so if you want to go there for lunch (and you have a big group), make reservations as it gets very busy.  Can't go wrong:)"}
{"text":"I went to this place last night for a bachelorette reunion. The staff was really nice and friendly, the food is average for a sport bar, we did not wait long for our food even though we were a group of around 20 girls. The only problem was at the moment to get our bills, since the guy did not keep proper track of each so it took long to fix bills and ask everyone what each ordered."}
{"text":"Love Love Union Social Eatery - and am sooo happy that it's in my neck of the woods! Yonge and Sheppard can't get any more convenient and this restaurant is housed in what was a very bad \"Mexican\" restaurant...  The set up is basically the same, but the food is great. For those who have been to the St. Clair location, the menagerie of yummy eats is ever presence. My SO and I tried the Fish Taco's, the Quesadillas (which were heaven and made with a Nan-like flaky pastry) and I tried the Gourmet Salad with Chicken which is a very popular dish; It's healthy, filling, and yummy!  We sat right by the window's which were open to let a cool breeze in...but if you love booths, this restaurant sure has them.  Service was smiley and great. I have no complaints about Union Social Eatery and am so happy there is another lunch-work-celebration place to eat at!!"}
{"text":"Better then average roadhouse.  Cut above Milestones and other like resto's"}
{"text":"This place is very similar to moxies feel. They offer some burgers, some mains (like pasta, rice) and salads.  Me and some friends came here on Friday night for drinks. I opted for a chocolate lager that they were featuring that night. Super cool! It's like a dark chocolate bitter after taste.  We also ordered some food like chicken nuggets with a side of the sushi roll. As well as the chicken with the side of their truffle fries. The sushi roll was good!!!! I would come here again for it!! Chicken nuggets was not too good. Pretty hard and dry, same with their chicken. Truffle fries... I expected to be way better. Only had a few seasoning at the top of the pile.  I would come here again for casual drinks and bites."}
{"text":"Make a reservation for a daytime meal. With its location, it's always packed at lunch.  I've been here multiple times and never disappointed by the food. Great selection and good service.   There's something for everyone on the menu!  No let down.  Good for a date night, group meal or business meeting."}
{"text":"stumbled upon this place after looking at Yelp reviews from people in the area.  we started off a group of two and by the end of the night there were 6 of us.   we had let them know as soon as we got there that we were expecting more friends as the night went on, and she said once a larger booth opens up she'd move is right away. (all night it never happened)   regardless, Charlie was our server and he was just awesome! from recommending (and repeating for us many time) picks from the menu. he was patient and very friendly and very accommodating.  we started off with the fries - make sure you order the garlic sauce on the side, it adds the perfect kick to the already delicious fries.   as the night continued we had the calamari, the chicken tacos and sown flat bread with dips. kept it just to apps but it was all delicious.   to finish the night we ordered the brownie, the cookies with ice cream and the creme brûlée. my favourite was the brownie!   definitely will return here again, I want to try a main course and one of their burgers next time!"}
{"text":"We went there for our wedding anniversary.  The staff was very friendly and Knowledgeable about their food. We were very impressed that they had a gluten-free menu. I had the steak and frites and my wife had the gluten-free killer chicken sandwich. Both were amazing."}
{"text":"Always great food and great vibes - we order take out about once a week. The Caesar salad is amazing, just beware it's a very garlicky! I'd recommend their burgers as well as the dragon rolls"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this place!! Love the menu options for lunch and dinner! Food is so good! Great healthy options as well. Atmosphere during the week is more business-y due to the after-work crowd, see a lot of young professionals when I go. Evenings weekends are more laid back and chill with a younger crowd. Waitresses have always been great. Place is usually  buzzing 7-days a week in my experience."}
{"text":"I'm excited that my 700th review is also the 70th for this amazing Mississauga restaurant. What a day I have had here (and literally I've been here for 4 hours).  Union Social Eatery, is located in the bustling business district of Mississauga just off of Derry Rd on Financial Drive. If you live in Peel Region (or anywhere really) and you've never been... stop what you're doing, Immediately, and get your butt in here.  USE (for short) is so many things to so many people, that it's hard to accurately describe them, so I'll go with Contemporary Canadian style fare. Again that doesn't even begin to describe them. They've more rustic than a Moxies or Earls, have better beer than your average spot (with almost 50% of their taps being held by Ontario Craft Breweries).   If you're indecisive normally when you eat out this place will drive you mental because the selection is extensive and each item sounds mouth watering. From Curry's and Pad Thais, to Burgers, gourmet salads and big ass sandwiches, and I'm not even talking about standouts like their almond crusted fried chicken tenders. But don't worry, the staff here know that you're up against and do their best to trim your choices down to a few 'Must haves' to you don't go crazy.  Being one of those indecisive people, I crumbled and went with my go to, a signature burger. In fact I went with the Epic Cheese Burger and asked for the double smoked bacon to be added. It was Epic... end of story. Perfectly cooked, not overly charred, still crazy juicy inside and all the toppings meant I didn't need to add much more than a little tab of ketchup to have it reach perfection.  The coolest thing, in my opinion is their monthly featured craft tap. Each month the promote a different craft beer and on Mondays (if you're extra nice) you can score a pint of that feature for $5.  So much more to try and I know that I'll need to return several more times just to put a tiny dent in the menu.  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Nicely designed space with friendly service but the food was just not cutting it.  The menu is eclectic, upper scale bar food that IMO tries to be too many things to too many people and ends up being nothing special to anybody.  I've tasted the burger, salad, tacos, and sushi and everything was just OK nothing special.    The prices are not cheap either. The $20+/head lunch crowd from the offices are going to expect more.  As for the dinner crowd, Yonge & St. Clair residents are mostly older folks so I don't know how many will come to a Road house-type spot for dinner.  It place seems a bit out of place with neighborhood but does fill a niche."}
{"text":"Good food but not amazing. Good for a quick affordable meal if you want to avoid fast food."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this restaurant out since it replaced Smokey Joe's.   Walking in there on a Saturday afternoon was pretty empty. They do have a rooftop patio upstairs but since it was too hot outside, we decided to sit inside.  I can't say I loved the food, it was pretty mediocre. Though a nice sized portion, the fish and chips were not crispy, and almost soggy. I did enjoy the fresh coleslaw though.  I ordered a mojito, which was A-OK and almost sour tasting.  The service could use some work, since we got up a couple of times to find the waitress."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was welcoming and beautiful with a rustic feel. The service was amazing. The girls are really attentive and always refilled my pop and water.  The food was a three star. The service was five star. Had the chicken carbonara pasta, way too much onion. The white cream sauce  had so much onion it overpowered all the other flavours in the dish. The firecracker braised ribs were decent for 10 dollars. The burgers are average. I've had bigger and juicier patties before.   Would come back here again because service was fabulous and atmosphere was nice. Food was decent and everything under 20 dollars so can't really complain. You pay for what you get."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here last night for the first time. The experience was overall a good one. The service was surprisingly quick, considering how crowded the restaurant was.   The Blackened Chicken Cappeline, was a dish I would definitely recommend, it was creamy and cheesy and just overal delicious! The sharpness of the cheese cut through the creamy dish just perfectly, and the portion size was just right. Also the Mars Bar Brownie, was to die for, it was warm, thick, fudgy, and had just the right amount of ice cream on top. Also I have to mention  their housemade caramel! I am not joking when I say I honestly wanted to pick up the plate and lick it all off!   Obviously I wouldn't do that in a restaurant, so I opted for the next best thing, which was swiping the plate with each fork full of brownie. Overall the food was great!   With that said the atmosphere wasn't the greatest. Right when we sat down we noticed right away that this restaurant was much more noisy then any other restaurant we have ever been in. Besides the noise, the rest of the experience was a good one. I loved the booths. They have two, four, and seven person booths, I personally hate sitting on a table in the middle of the restaurant, so to see that my concern would never be a problem here, I was thrilled!    Overall I gave Union Social Eatery a 4/5. Due to my great experience with the food and service. The only reason I didn't give them a 5/5 was because of the noisy atmosphere.   With all this said I would still highly recommended this restaurant to anyone who is looking to go out have fun with friends or the family, just don't expect a quiet night out!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend on a weekday and it was really busy. The place has a great vibe to it - it's hip and casual. I had the swordfish sandwich, which was pretty good. The truffle  parmesan fries didn't really taste much like truffle oil. I like that their menu has several solid options on it."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Came here and expected to wait a long time due to the game playing tonight; however, to our surprise the place wasn't too packed and we were seated right away. We ordered the banh mi chicken tacos, the calamari and the rose penne. My personal favourite were the tacos because of his flavourful they were. We were even given a free appetizer because it was our first time there. The food definitely exceeded my expectations and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This place was great! The servers were very attentive and friendly and the food was DELICIOUS!  My boyfriend and I are always exploring new places to have brunch in the city. With that being said, our meal really stood out, in particular I loved their potatoes. I don't know how they made it but they have a light fruity flavour to them, as if they've been soaked in peach or apple juice before being cooked. Great food over all, highly recommended! Definitely going to bring my friends next time!"}
{"text":"Supposedly it is a 4 star restaurant but the experience wasn't. Out of the menu, only the drinks were decent. I had ordered a Crispy Calamari and Fish and Chips. The Calamari was really hard to chew and the fish and chips came without the tartar sauce. Surprisingly, it was still very busy. The environment was good and our waitress was sweet, however the food there did not meet the mark of a 4 star eatery. The food is really expensive for the quality that is delivered. If you want to go to a really nice bar with really good food try Drake the firkin Pub in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Came here last night (Saturday @530pm) for the first time and had a very enjoyable meal experience.  Everyone from the hostess to the waiters were completely friendly and not overly nice or annoying.  Everything is supposed to be made in-house and the quality is noticeable.   Ordered the Nachos, buffalo chicken tacos and truffle fries:  Nachos - always always a staple for me on pubfare, and although everything tasted amazing, (shoutout to the spicy jalapeno!) it always saddens me when each layer is not layered properly with every ingredient.  Most of the chips on the bottom do not have toppings, but because of how fresh everything else tasted, I can let it slide.  Tacos - just a great combination of flavors. Nothing is overpowering and I DESTROYED these too quick. really really good and nice sizes too.  truffle fries - oven cooked and not too greasy, perfect combo for something saucy like my tacos  and you get a good portion!  The staff also gave me a complimentary molten brownie cake with ice cream because it was my first time at Union social, and it was just melt in your mouth goodness!  Only docking the one star for the Nacho layering haha but definitely will be back for social gatherings!"}
{"text":"Came here on a saturday evening for drinks and dinner and sat up at the patio.  We got a bunch of beers (all decently priced), and 2 apps.  The korean tacos were really good! and in my opinion, really well priced too!  Service was a bit slow and scattered and the patio got really chilly!  I'd definitely come back here for the good food, and decently priced beer!!"}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times ....Watered down drinks and a mediocre tasting selection of food. . . Service I'd okay they change their menu often and get rid of the good dishes  I'd recommend popping next door to the The Drake to be honest :)"}
{"text":"One of the highest rated restaurants in Mississauga, I thought it was time to give Union Social Eatery a try. Let's just start by saying it did not dissapoint.  I made reservations for 2 on Opentable and upon arrival was led to a booth for 2. The restaurant has a very pleasant atmosphere, what I would call classy casual.   Started off with a bottle of malbec ($28), almond crusted chicken tenders and the smoky club flatbread to share.  The food took a while to come out but when it did it was perfection. Good portions, hot and flavorful. Our fave was the chicken tenders. Just absolutely juicy on the inside and soo crunchy on the outside. The two sauces that accompany it were very well done, as were the fries. The flatbread massive, generous with the toppings and enmeshed in flavours. It was a dish that made my eyes and mouth happy!   After that, we were pretty satisfied but being our piggy selves, we went for the calamari which was alright.  We had planned to get mains but at this stage we were full up to our necks. But just had enough room for dessert or so we thought!! We each got the warm mars bar brownie because who shares dessert!! OMG it was a hugeee portion. We changed up the ice cream and got the vanilla bean instead of the mint. I don't know where they get there ice cream from but it's  heaven. I'd have been happy with a scoop of it alone. The brownie was super chocolaty and moist and was everything a dessert of this type is supposed to be. I ended up taking the brownie home because I just could not get any more in!   Overall the restaurant has a great atmosphere, friendly service, ahhhmazing food and very reasonable prices. Our bill was $100 with tips, for 3 apps and a bottle of wine which is quite reasonable. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This place opened up where Estrella was just north of yonge and sheppard. A restaurant with three levels, the bar and pool tables are on the main, some booths for dining on the second floor and access to a large open patio seating area. The bar is pretty nice with an exposed pipes look. I've been here a few times for lunch and the food is pretty good, I like their burgers and they have a really creamy and delicious mushroom soup. Only issue I've had with place is the patio could be a bit cleaner, was seated next to a few piles of rat crap at eye level on the outdoor patio, I understand it's outdoors but the staff should care enough to clean that kind of stuff so patrons don't see it and have their meal ruined. Aside from that one issue though this place does well in just about every other category. Try The Cajun chicken sandwich it is pretty spicy and has a nice jerk kick!"}
{"text":"Yes i like it here before im going again this month for some steak and burger for fun. I just dont know if it is still good after i went. :)"}
{"text":"A bit torn about this review so I'll start with the bad first since it is a short list and may need to be highlighted as it's in direct conflict with my 5 star rating.   The bad: Food - it's true what the other reviewers say that it's mediocre. My fish was super battery a tiny bit soggy. BUT but house made gravy is to die for (be careful as the server failed to mention it was an additional $2 but I was happy to pay for this little bit of pleasure that came in a very generous serving). What made up for the average food was their awesome dessert which came at such a reasonable price AND made in house too.  Service - ok it's not really a negative per se but all the tables in my area (including ours) must have been asked numerous times if so and so dish was theirs. Nope. So that was a bit of a mess as it didn't seem like they knew which table the orders belonged to.   The good: I went with a very loud eclectic group of ladies who usually only see each other once a year. 5 of us all different age groups and different backgrounds. Honestly at first we thought our waitress was gonna hate us cuz one of our friends kept annoying her with some comments. But she kept it together.   I'm not sure if this is normal practice but when we told her we hadn't been here before - the manager came over to say hi not long after. I was certain we must have annoyed him too cuz we all talk so much. After our meal he personally brought over a brownie with ice cream for all of us to share! Honestly we were completely pleasantly surprised. It was to die for so we proceeded to order more more more. We got the creme brûlée and the cookies with ice cream. Incredible. Heave. Cookies were perfect. They were so accommodating as my friend and I shared the cookie dessert but couldn't agree on the ice cream flavour and voila the manager said we will get a scoop each.   He was really lovely. Stopped by to check in. We had a lot of banter. Ask him about maple. He knows A LOT about maple lol.   We ask for the bill and ... what? All the added dessert was also on the house ... I mean seriously? Hands down ... my friends and I agreed it was such a good going out experience we had since we don't really go out much. Especially today which was particularly crappy with extreme winds and power outage. Thanks Union!!! Now I must google where Schomberg is (inside joke! Yup. We are at that level now haha)"}
{"text":"This location has so much potential. Patio was a great setup -I didn't get to enjoy it but looked cozy. Food was tasty. Nachos were just right. More jalapeños would have been made it perfect. If you're a heat lover. Killer Chicken was good. A little greasy and salty. Stick with a healthy side. Thirst Only to be quenched by warm beer on tap. That's was why I rated what I did. Also stuck on the second floor the AC was not working well. I felt sorry for the servers.  They worked their asses off only to be going up and down those stairs at least 30 times in the 2.5 hours I was there. Sorry no pics. Fingers were too greasy and the restrooms were in the basement.   I'll have to try the other location some time."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, food and service!  I like the innovative menu which, in theory, should not work well. I dont know how they pull it off."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times. A bit busy during the lunch hour but food served fast. Dishes are delicious! Like the martinis and the boots... lol"}
{"text":"We've visited this place a handful of times at various times and it's never disappointed in any way! The food, service and atmosphere beats out any other local pub / restaurants by far. Last visit was a reservation on St Patrick's day and we had another night of fun with great service. I ordered their almond crusted chicken fingers with candy salad (again ... I just can't help it they're amazing) and my husband had their special lamb burger which he said was great too. Drinks are made well and good and drinks come out quick even when they're packed on a Saturday night. Try their mojito and they're Caesars  Can't wait til our next night out we know where we'll be going again!"}
{"text":"Great Food and Friendly staff. Great place to hang out and a really Chill vibe. Must try!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 7 friends for the first time on a Saturday night and I was really disappointed by my experience, especially given all the great reviews for this place! Our server was generally pleasant, although she became pretty impatient when a friend of mine asked two questions about an item on the menu. As for the quality of the food, it really is quite average (like say, Pickle Barrel). The \"Killer Chicken\" burger I ordered had a very thin and dry chicken patty. Then, one of my friends found three hairs on her fish and chips (one of which was actually in the batter of her fish...) Another friend ordered the poutine and had major stomach issues right after (but we can't truly know the cause of that). Overall, I'm not quite sure if I'll give this restaurant another chance! Maybe i'll try the other location..."}
{"text":"I tried Union Social Eatery for the first time on Friday and was very surprised how much I enjoyed it. I had the Philly Steak Naan Wrap with truffle fries and it was amazing.   I like how you can book reservations online. It was very easy to do, and we didnt have to wait at all on a Friday night.    I look forward to the warmer weather to try the roof top."}
{"text":"While waiting for some friends on a Friday morning, I dropped in to have brunch. Ended up having the veggie burger that was just delicious. The burger came with tasty fries and a side of homemade gravy. When in uptown area, again I will for sure head back for a few cocktails. I want to try their rooftop patio this summer!"}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's birthday and really enjoyed it! It's pretty large (with two floors), really nice and trendy. I really enjoyed my chicken rosee penne, the pasta was fresh and delicious. The goat cheese tasted really fresh. I really liked that all the dishes are made fresh in house.  The mars bar brownie was delicious! So fluffy and moist and delicious. I typically find brownies too rich but this one perfect. The service was great for the most part. It got really busy and our waitress took a long time to refill our drinks.  I'd definitely recommend this place and plan on going back."}
{"text":"Another Yelp event wins again!  It's a very nice fancy bar/restaurant, with lots of high seating and room for big groups, as was ours that night.   The lighting was dimmed for an evening social atmosphere, the music was appropriate for the mood and was great relaxed but upbeat setting. IS that an oxymoron??   I wouldn't necessarily say this is a family dining out place unless your family is older than 13yrs old. No offense to the young childrens of the world. But tonight was definitely adults night! :)  Being a Yelp event, we had beer that was $5 a pint and appys to start. I tried the calamari which was cooked to perfection and the Smokey Club flatbread which was delicious as well. After sampling I was still hungry for a main course. I chose the swordfish which was recommended by all the guys at my end of the table.  I paired that with the seasonal grilled veggies and a side Candy house salad.   ~ Korean-style seared Swordfish topped with a oyster mushroom hoisin sauce!  I was not wowed by the swordfish, I think mostly because I love salmon and for this meal I think I was wanting a Cow steak. The swordfish is a meatier fish, not really a fishy taste and what made it for me was the sweet sauce on top.   ~ The grilled yellow and green zucchini was AWESOME!! I love grilled veggies  ~ Candy House salad is a bed of mixed greens topped with sugared walnuts, mango, black fig, feta cheese, roaster red peppers and a maple-pommery vinaigrette. THIS was my favorite part of my meal! So delicious! I would next time come get this and have a medium rare steak! Droooing at the thought already!   I really enjoyed my experience, Thank you USE!!"}
{"text":"Cool spot! Easy to find with lots of street and Green P parking. There's a dining area and a bar area, but you can see a TV from almost any location.   Menu has a lot of good choices and decent pricing. Good beer selection, as well. I had the Roasted Mushroom Melt Burger. Pretty good! Lots of cheese, not tons of mushrooms, but you didn't make a mess on your plate from losing toppings. The fries were blah, but the burger was big, so I didn't have room for them anyway.  Service was friendly. She joked with us while we tried to decide on food. She was really cool and could make any experience better just from her upbeat attitude and sense of humour. More places need servers like her!  A good experience, I'd go back to see what else they've got."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent. It's definitely a step up from Moxies. If I'm in the mood for \"American\" food close to home, I wouldn't mind coming here.   Ordered the steak frite. The steak was cooked well... perfect medium rare. I'm guessing they added some type of herb butter, which complimented it well. I was a big fan of the fries. Price was not bad at about $23  I saw some of the dishes being served around us, and in general the portions look pretty generous."}
{"text":"What a great service experience!! Our server, Melissa was really friendly and entertaining. We were visiting from Florida and she made us feel very welcome. The food was great too, but it took second stage to the phenomenal table side manners of the whole crew. It was a great experience. If you are siting in a hotel looking at ratings of local eateries, look no further. GO HERE!!"}
{"text":"First time here tonight and I must point out that the truffle fries and tacos (banh mi and Korean) were outstanding as the reviews say!   We came during a busy week night and were seated immediately. Waitress was nice and helped start us off with drinks. We ordered the fish and chips, UFO (house special burger), and 2 taco dishes.   The burgers are made in house and you can certainly tell. They were juicy and not dry.   Both tacos were very good renditions of a new Asian + Mexican fusion.   Everything tasted good and fresh. On top of that they gave us a complimentary sample of their firecracker dish, which we will certainly order next time !   All in all a good experience that met the hype from other yelp reviews. Bill worked out to be 35 per person with tip. Not bad considering we had 2 appetizers to share and a big main course. I will be returning back here when I'm in Sauga again. My only suggestion is do not wear sweats like I did. I felt overly underdressed. For guys at least jeans and a button up to fit in and casual dresses for ladies."}
{"text":"Needed a quick bite to eat before I headed over to Escape Games so we opted for some grub at Union Social Eatery. It was a Thursday night at about 7:30pm and we requested a table for 3. The hostess grabbed a waitress to escort us to a table right away which was great because I was hungrier than I thought. Another waitress came over immediately and took our drink order and she returned quite fast. She then asked if we were ready to order and we weren't ready just yet, she was returning much faster than normal. We told her we weren't ready yet so happily agreed to come back in a few and again she came back sooooo fast! She did the same thing when she brought us the dessert menu but I won't complain because I'd rather an over attentive waitress than a non-attentive one.   I was so hungry I didn't know what to get but our waitress suggested the Epic cheeseburger with avocado and bacon. It was a decent burger nothing crazy. My sister got the chicken bowtie pasta and my brother got the fish and chips. Everyone enjoyed their meal but it wasn't wow-worthy. I give Union Social a 4 star rating because of the service and atmosphere. A cool place to grab appetizers and watch a game."}
{"text":"I brought my girlfriend here for her birthday, it was our first time eating here and it was great! We had an amazing waitress named Jeannette who took great care of us and was really sweet. She helped recommend dishes on the menu, ingredients of which are apparently all made in house and taste delicious! We tried Korean tacos, mushroom burger, and ufo burgers which we enjoyed so much. Also, since it's our first time she got us a complimentary platter of 3 dips with tortilla chips and pita bread on the side and wow those were good too. Then at the end she surprised us with a free slice of blueberry cheesecake with a candle for my gf which we were already too stuffed to finish so we took the leftovers home because like everything else it was so good! Jeanette was so kind we ended up even hugging each other goodbye and taking bday pics with her, and even told the manager how great she was! We really enjoyed our dinner here and I highly recommend this place for a date night. I'm sure the place is great for groups too. We were there around 10pm on a Friday night and it didn't feel too crowded or noisy, got seated fast."}
{"text":"Amazing good. Great service. Casual, but upscale atmosphere. Great prices - everything is apparently under $17.00."}
{"text":"Please do something for the sound pollution!!! Beautiful decoration but something is missed in design. After 10 minutes you are not enjoying your time and food, unfortunately. I like this place but please do something for that much noise. You can hardly hear your friends or even waiter. It could be much more better experience if you could be able to fix it. There are lots of elements and materials in your decoration that reflect the sound, find a way to correct it some how. Metals, polished acrylic wood tables, concrete floor; they may be beautiful decoration but not a good combination in terms of sound pollution. It is hardly possible for me to chose to come next time."}
{"text":"Came by again today but the menu has changed since I was there last and there was nothing that I wanted to eat except the burger and I wasn't about to pay $15 . Nothing but craft beers on tap and a very limited bottled beer offered. Service was nice but I didn't stay to eat as this place is way too expensive. Went elsewhere and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for lunch. Biggest problem was finding parking in this parking lot at lunch time!   The place was packed when we got there (I guess that's a good thing). We had the Nachitos as a starter (pretty good but not much quantity) and I ordered the chicken Pad Thai as my main course. The quality and quantity of the pad thai was good and I was happy with it (even had some left over to bring home) but the food was a bit pricy.   Overall I would recommend this place to someone who wants to try a different restaurant other than the usual kelseys, BP, etc. as they do have a pretty good menu that has a few things I haven't seen before (swordfish burger!)"}
{"text":"*** Celiac Friendly ***  Still one of the best places to eat in Mississauga and gluten free makes it even better. I am totally a fan! Try their flatbreads. When you order one GF, it's more like a pizza. I love the Smoky Club and have them add pepperoni - one of the best pizzas in town!  Oh yeah - they added a separate fryer so now their fries are GF."}
{"text":"Went to Union Social for my birthday dinner.  I had been a couple times before and thoroughly enjoyed it. But this time  our reservation for 5 waited a longtim to place our order than waited again for our drinks. Our dinner took 45 minutes to arrive. My daughter had mentioned in advance we were celebrating my birthday. Nearing the end of dinner the waitress made no mention of dessert. So my daughter walked to the entrance asking about her request acknowledging my birthday. I chose the brownie it was delicious. The restaurant is extremely loud I suspect this evening they were short staffed the reason for the long wait for dinner, our drinks as well our bill and paying for our bill."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and not once have I been disappointed. If this is yours and your whole group's first time, you can let the manager know and receive a complimentary brownie dessert with ice cream!  The staff is very friendly with helpful suggestions if you need help with choosing what to order. The meal comes out relatively quickly and in big portions.   The firecracker (veggies or not) are an absolute must-try! It definitely melts in your mouth!"}
{"text":"The service was a bit slow and it wasn't busy at all. However, awesome decor and enjoyed the Sushi"}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The food offered a diverse variety, as well as tasted amazing and the portions were just perfect."}
{"text":"Was trying to gather some information for our corporate party. The event manager was so rude.   He refused to provide details about the venue and directly demanded me to for site visit. He literally said \"we open till 1am\" - are you saying that I have to go take a look by myself no matter how late it is??  I understand that you have \"many\" bookings to go through but sorry I have many places to visit and check too. Asked 10+ places this is the worst one I ever encountered.  One star for your \"invitation\"."}
{"text":"On a Saturday evening some friends decided to head out to Union for a last minute birthday dinner. It was hard to get dinner reservations in downtown Toronto because of TIFF. The drive down out west from Brampton wasn't bad at all and we found parking conveniently infront of this restaurant/bar. I walked in with my friend and the place was dimly lit, music wasn't too loud and this place was totally live. The atmosphere can work for a date night or a friends get together. We were seated along with our friends and the server Sarah was so friendly and thoroughly explained the dinner specials. Earlier in the day I had a huge double angus burger so I had no room for dinner but still needed to eat something ( hate that feeling). After I browsed through the menu, I decided to order some apps. I ordered the angus short rib sliders and the calamari. The server was really attentive and brought out all of our food at once. Now let me tell you about these 3 moist, flavourful, soaked in BBQ sauciness sliders.. Ahhh so good! I was thinking to order another round but then I thought to myself \"you ding bat you could've ordered an entree\". Anyway sad to say, the calamari wasn't too good. It was so salty and I actually started to get a headache from how overly salty it was! I got the servers attention and told her about the calamari and she was more than happy to get us something else. I took a good look at the menu again and decided to try the Mediterranean dip platter. After waiting about 10 minutes, she came out with med platter and I digged right in. The platter had pita and tortilla chips, with these three incredible dips; hummus, sundried tomato feta dip and calamata tapenade. It was so delicious that I ended up getting more chips because there was so much dip left. Now I'm awfully curious to try everything else on the menu. I will definitely be back for the dip and sliders.. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Daily specials here for drinks is great on these hot summer days. A nice cold Sleeman to go with burger and fries ain't a bad combination. I had the mushroom burger with the upgraded truffle fries. Hearty serving of food in a timely manner with attentive staff.   Truffle fries are a must at this place. Get them here every time."}
{"text":"This place was just okay, not the best.   Atmosphere is nice and casual. It's a great place for groups or to go watch a game on TV at the bar. The service is good but not spectacular.  Here are some of the dishes I've tried over the 2 times I've been: Garlic Ceasar Salad - It's like eating a garlic. I've had garlic ceasar before but their's just had way too much garlic in it. Everything else about it was good. They are not cheap about the cheese. But the garlic flavour is just too much.  Nachitos - Great! Would order it again. It's the perfect serving size for a pair.  Smoked Club Flatbread - Too much sauce which made the flavour overbearing. After having one piece, I thought it was good. But I didn't feel like having another. I would not order this again."}
{"text":"This one was a tough one to decide upon a rating. Some dishes came out full of flavour but mine was a complete miss.  So I gave them the benefit of the doubt and rounded up my 1.5. The good news was the Blackened Chicken Bowties.  A very flavourful dish and the pasta was nicely done to al dente.  Also a generous portion. The bad news was the 'attempt' at their Herbed Brie Double Chicken. It was advertised as a double chicken breast however I got the leg and thigh of what looked like a cornish game hen.  The 'brie' portion was minimal and was over-whelmed with the red pepper sauce.  It looked great on the menu but what was delivered fell well short. Service was okay throughout the night so that was a positive."}
{"text":"I've passed by the area and surprisingly never noticed it (I'm probably blind because its actually pretty big). My girlfriend was Yelp'n for places and found this place after reading the good reviews about it including one by Kris.  So we went here for dinner around 5:30pm on Friday. We were asked if we made reservations (which we didn't) so we were seated at a high-top table in the dining area. They had said there were lots of reservations made that night, so to me it felt like that might mean they are a good restaurant.   They had a pitcher of beer special on Fridays ($15 per pitcher), but I just got water. We decided to get Korean beef tacos. They got delivered within a few minutes, and OMG they were DELICIOUS! There were 3 of them and the flavor was so good, you all must give them a try! I was tempted to order another plate as my meal but I decided to go with the grilled Dijon salmon. Never had salmon with Dijon sauce, but it was delicious as well.  We both agreed that we would come back again and recommend to our friends. I actually plan to go back again today with my friends for some tacos :).  Check this place out of you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Food was good service was good. Honestly the only flaw was how dead it was, made it kind of uncomforting   Came with friends and got appetizers and beers   It was a Sunday around 8 and we were the only people in there ."}
{"text":"Love love LOVEEEE this place! They are so awesome, from the hosts to the servers to the managers. Love them all.   But the food is truly amazing. One of the best fish and chips I've ever had, great shoestring fries and a delicious batter. The almond crusted chicken tenders are my favourite. Also try the tacos. And the burgers. And the steak frites.   Just try anything on their menu and you'll be happy. Even the kids portions are amazing!  Go. Go now."}
{"text":"It was our first time there in a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch. It wasn't busy at all so we got seated quickly and got the booth we wanted. The menu had a good variety of foods.  But I would encourage to have more vegetarian and gluten free options. Also think about NON GMO. My husband ordered a pasta and then ordered the chicken tacos. A friend ordered the fish sandwich and I ordered the spinach salad. Everyone enjoyed their food and was pleased with it. My issue was with the temperature of the restaurant. It was freezing cold. Instead of heat cold air like AC was blowing. I couldn't understand for the life of me why they would do that. We Had to have our coats on as we ate. That's not what a nice dining experience should be. That's why I'm Giving it a 3 star."}
{"text":"Yummy food, amazing staff especially the manager. They even gave us free food for our first experience! Large portions and a warm atmosphere. Very accommodating to changes. Recommend highly!"}
{"text":"Just finished eating with my family to celebrate Mother's Day and everything was fantastic!   Great food, good atmosphere and great customer service.   Overall, a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 10 on a Sunday evening. Had reservations so we were seated right away.  The restaurant wasn't very busy for a Saturday night though.  I've been here twice before and both times thought the food was average at best.  Maybe third time will be a charm? Not so much.. Wife and I both ordered burgers, she had the smokehouse burger and I had the epic cheeseburger.  When we got our food, she had maybe 25% of the fries of others while I had about 50% of what others had on their plates. We notified that server, who was really efficient by the way, and she brought out 2 big bowls of fries for us.  The wife's burger bun was burnt and not just around the edges, she had to scrape off the burnt parts.  The burgers were decent, but found the meat to be a tad dry.  Like I mentioned earlier, our server was really efficient even with a large group! We had 5 separate bills and she was cool with it. Our water glasses were never empty. No issues with service whatsoever.   To end, great service, average food."}
{"text":"Yes..!! this place is awesome!  We went here for Summerlicious for lunch yesterday with three friends and all of us said we will DEFINITELY go back!  We had Jill as our server and she was so friendly and attentive.  The manager came to chat at our table too and she was super friendly!  Besides the amazing service, the atmosphere is nice too.  It's great having the large open windows near the front.    Best of all was the food!  WOW!  I was not expecting a burger to be so awesome, but it honestly was.  I got the chicken burger and it was so delicious.  The sauce was amazing, and the guac was delicious, and the chicken was moist and not dry.  Even the fries were awesome!  The other people I was with got the swordfish burger and the beef burger and they were also wowed.  The salads were good too, but the best part was dessert!  I got the peach basil creme brulee which was delicious, but the mars brownie which my boyfriend got was amazing!!!  I ate mine and half of his!    We looked at their regular menu and everything sounded awesome, and the prices were very reasonable, under $20 for an entree.    I would definitely recommend this place.  It's nice to have a casual restaurant on the Summerlicious lineup too.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Well I must say...I've been to the Mississauga location and now the Toronto location and it's still a great place to go!  Our server named Pema was on point from beginning to end!  She was awesome!  Very attentive and friendly all night, never had to ask for a drink, she always asked if we needed anything and checked in on us periodically.  Good job Pema!!!  Now the food...let me tell you...we had a group of 10 ppl and everyone's plates were empty.  I got the dragon roll, which was yummy.  Also, got steak and frites cooked perfectly at my liking of medium.  For alcoholic drinks, I got the Caesar and southern comfort.  Not only Pema was friendly, but all the other servers were friendly.  As we were leaving, multiple people who worked there said bye as we were leaving and it was a nice thing to see!  If you haven't been to a Union Social Eatery in Mississauga or Toronto yet...you need to!"}
{"text":"Ate here a couple weeks ago. We were pleasantly surprised at the food and service.  There are high-top tables and benches. The tables by the windows are great - the windows open right up to allow fresh air. It also makes it easy to get in and out of the restaurant - we saw a few people just walk right in.   Definitely a great find in the neighbourhood. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great spot which is close to my hotel. Stopped in here after reading the reviews from Yelp and man this place did not disappoint. Great bar with excellent service and spectacular food. What more could you ask for in an awesome city?"}
{"text":"Went to Union Social Eatery for the first time with my grandfather.  We wanted to try something different and this was fantastic.  The food was great but I think gramps got the better meal.  I ordered the Steak Frites medium rare, it was tasty, the fries were perfect, but it was more like steak with a side of fries. Normally when I order steak frites id expect the steak to be maybe sliced up, but more so on a bed of fries with some peppercorn gravy, besides the point though it was still good.  Here's what threw me for a loop. My grandfather ordered the almond crusted chicken fingers, I thought \"okay, simple order probably plain and boring\" to my surprise they were amazing! The sauces that came with the fingers were so good, the fingers themselves tasted amazing as well. Overall I definitely would come back here.   Side note: The vibe is great, and seems like a great date spot as well, the service could have been a bit better but no real complaints on that front."}
{"text":"Our server was very inattentive. Kept going behind the bar to fill drink. We sat there for approx 20minutes waiting for the bill. It was even worse when the server looked directly at me three times and saw we were waiting and proceeded to walk away from us. The food was phenomenal though. The steak was fantastic. However to me personally a server can make or break the experience. And ours broke it."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. My friend came here for her birthday and we celebrated her birthday, which was also craft beer night. A bottle of Erdinger for $6, you say? Yes please!  Seating was comfy and service was great. The place had a very cool, hip feel to it. We decided to order a bunch of appetizers to share rather than do big meals.  The chicken wings were great... both sauces! We also ordered the fries (parmesan on the side), the beef rib burgers (VERY good) and the tuna tacos (not bad).   One thing I have to mention, they were very very accommodating about my food allergy, and put all the dairy on the side so my cheese-eating friends could have it.   A neat place for a relaxing night out with friends."}
{"text":"I finally made it to this place. Funny enough it's one of the highest rated places in the city and near my work.  This is certainly a 21st century fusion-based restaurant. You'll find various Asian influences, some Italian, classic North American and modern trends. I imagine the 'Union' of their name suggests a gathering, but it could very well also represent the union of flavours they're combining.   I'd heard about the Korean tacos, and was craving them coming in, so I went with it. The tacos are actually an appetizer, so I added a side of fries to it. Everything's quite fresh about the tacos, and I really enjoyed the slaw. The beef could've had some more 'umph' to them, and the Sriracha mayo could've leaned a little less to the mayo and more to the spiciness for my tastes. All that said, they're still very enjoyable. The fries were quite good and no charge for the side of aioli.   Prices are generally quite good here. I found the appies a little more on the expensive side, but a good number of the mains were right around $15 and most under $20. Service was top-notch too.  Next time, I will probably go with a real main, and I've heard a lot about their burgers. My interest is certainly piqued to return and I may update my review."}
{"text":"Went for nachos and beer after work with peers. The nachos were excellent. Great atmosphere, good beer, great service. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here recently and for a chain restaurant it was pretty good.  It's similar to a Moxie's or Kelsey's in my opinion, but I feel the food here is better.    I had the Candy House Salad ($11.98) and added BBQ grilled chicken to it for an additional $4.  The salad consisted of mixed greens (a real mixed greens, not just romaine and iceberg, although it had too much romaine for my liking - but thankfully no iceberg!), mango, roasted red peppers, feta cheese, and figs.  The menu said it contained \"sugared walnuts\" but I didn't see or taste any in my salad :(  The dressing was a maple vinaigrette.  The added chicken was real breast meat.  The portion wasn't too generous, but it was acceptable.  Overall, the salad was good.  I liked the mix of ingredients.  Despite the word \"candy\" in its name,it wasn't too sweet (although maybe it's because I was missing the sugared walnuts).  Portion-size was good.  It was filling for a dinner.    So on the menu it says you can make any salad \"a Wozny\" for an additional $5.  I asked the server what this meant and he says it means \"almond-crusted chicken tenders\"  Apparently, there is a regular customer who comes there and always orders his Caesar salad with almond-crusted chicken tenders and his last name is Wozniak, so they put it on the menu in his honour, lol.  Sounds interesting, I might have to try it next time!    My husband had the BBQ Short Ribs with Cheddar-Chive Biscuit ($19.98).  It came with a side of spiced carrots, and it had a huge pile of fried onion strings on it.  I had some of the onion strings and they were excellent.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed his meal.  I didn't have any of the short ribs, but I saw him cutting it and it looked so soft and tender, like he didn't really need a knife!   Our server was Charlie and he was good.       Nice place.  The customers skew a bit on the younger end (at least it did on the Saturday night that we were there).  Lots of young couples on dates, I noticed.    It's in a strip mall, so there is lots of free parking."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with this place. What a yukki food. I have chicken vandaloo and I had a light food poising after that. It's a first time in a long long time. Starters were so so. We had calamari and nachos which were not bad. I was with my friends and some of them had a burger and some other chicken. Fries which came with it were overcooked. Burger was so so because my friends didn't finish it. But the place itself looked very nice and our waitress was great. Very disappointed with food though."}
{"text":"I went here about 6 months ago for a friends birthday and a reunion with a friend who had moved overseas. It was a fantastic night, but I was too distracted with the evening's events to notice how great this place is, although I left knowing that I wanted to go back.  So this past Friday I went with a couple friends to catch up over some beers and the Leaf's game. What a great evening! I made reservations the evening before because we wanted a good view of the TV's, the hostess taking my reservation was patient and did not end the call until she was certain I was happy with the location of the table she was holding for us. That was nice, considering most places rush you off the phone so quickly there is usually little time for questions or for preferences to be discussed.  We arrived around 7 and the place was full of the 'after-work' crowd. I expected it to stay busy, but it died down around 8-8:30. I am shocked that more people do not go, it would be a great vibe there if it was packed with the right crowd!  Food was delicious - I had the GF wings and I will order them again. For a somewhat slow night, our food took a looooong time to come out. We didn't complain but they were very apologetic and comp'd our food anyway - I am very impressed with the customer service.  I look forward to returning for another night of beer, wings and good company."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Friday cocktail.   Good cocktail, good shrimp taco app, although I found a hair in it.  Actually, under it (so obvs from the kitchen).  No biggie. I told the waitress just to let the kitchen know.  But I was fine eating the taco and I certainly didn't expect it comped.  Nobody from kitchen nor a manager ever came to apologize.  Woulda been professional. But whatever. Par for the course in Toronto service.  Not knocking a star off for the incident.  It's a decent friendly local 3 star place."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the environment and the meal.  The appetizer short rib tacos were amazing!  All of my party enjoyed their burgers and food. 5 star for sure!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this restaurant 2 of the 3 nights of my North York stay in late April. The food was excellent with so many great choices it was hard to choose. I enjoyed the chicken nachos and noodle bowl the first night and the fish and chips the second night. The servers were attentive. I look forward to returning next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch before it picked up and got too noisy - had the korean tacos and atlantic salmon and they were both divine. Service was quick and the atmosphere was cool; definitely gonna head back to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and was really underwhelmed. The fish for the rolls and salad I ordered seemed like they were going bad and not fresh at all. I know it's my a sushi restaurant but it should at least taste/look appealing. Also ordered the pasta and it was also mediocre. Willing to come back for dinner and give it another try."}
{"text":"Came here for after work drinks.  It is pretty cool for a suburban spot. I liked the service and the drinks. It wasfun. I do not think this is a \"family\" place, despite seeing kids there.  This is a bar lounge with good food. AVG pricing, but very good twist on bar food. Suits from the business park next to it frequent here.  I shall return!"}
{"text":"Union is a pretty nice bar and grill in suburbia that is not named Moxies or Earl's, although the decor of the place will certainly remind you of them. It's a *union* of chiq and suave ambiance with a large space which makes it a good place for a *social* meet up with friends, family, or whoever else you meet with.   The food started out mediocre out of the gates: the calamari ($10) was under-seasoned and the truffle fries ($8) were soggy. Not a good start.  Luckily, the entrees were much better. The almond crusted chicken fingers ($14) are breaded in an almond crumb batter and served with 3 sauces (mustard, bbq and ranch). It was a delightful \"union\" of flavours and textures; a really nice twist on your typical fingers and something I'd order again, and a dish that will get the table talking about - yay to *social*.  The salad with fig, mango and candied pecans ($10) *union*ized-together nicely, and you can add some protein on top for an extra $4. It was tasty and my protein of choice, steak, was well cooked, though a bit too cold.   The flatbread ($10-$12 I think) looked alright, nothing to be *social* about there.  There's also a decent selection of wine ($8/glass, $30/bottle) and beers (about $6-8 a pint) to really keep you *social*ly lubricated .  A 3.5 in my books."}
{"text":"Great service, food and drinks. Nice patio too! Have been plenty of times and will be back!"}
{"text":"I've come to know Union Social these last couple weeks, and I'm impressed.  The first time I grabbed a beer here with a colleague I thought it had a nice atmosphere, was well appointed, and had diligent and friendly staff.  Having eaten and drank here with some regularity at this point, I can attest to it's being one of Toronto's finest.  A great range of small bites (Korean tacos are a good example), burgers, sandwiches and main fare (the steak frites is quality).  The range of beers is extensive.  Just a great spot."}
{"text":"I'm quite surprised by all the rave reviews.... I arrived with a friend around 9:00pm and it was quite dead (it was a weekday). We had the nachos which lacked flavour... maybe having the chips tossed with salt would have been nice. We went on to try there burgers and they were quite dry and unpleasant, portions were great, beer and wine selection is great here but just didn't hit the spot as I am a big foodie. Thank god our server was welcoming... We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Always was very intrigued by the one on Erin Mills in Mississauga, however did not get the opportunity to try it out. Read reviews about the one at St Clair, and it had a giant fanfare.  So to my delight, to find out that one of my old favourite destinations at Yonge and Sheppard which used to be called Smokey Joe's (closed) for many many years and then turned into some Taco place who's doors shut as quick as it opened has been transformed into the Union Social Eatery.   They did not change much of the scenery inside the venue compared to Smokey Joe's but much more upgraded and elegant furniture.    I could tell the server's were sort of new there, but overall very friendly and honest girls who seem to be enjoying their role. However when I went to book the reservation; the one girl told me that they didn't have a patio. Which is not true. The PATIO is amazing!! Fire pits, cushioned seating, closed area on a rooftop. UGH...so upset that I booked a seat by the window downstairs; however it was still very pleasant.  Ok, now to the important part. The food, I left pleasantly satisfied. Daily drink specials are very affordable; to add on to a very wide array of craft beers and cocktails.   If you scroll through my photo's , you will see that I am a carnivore and not the biggest salad fan in the world. However, that CANDY salad. NOMS, citric and sweet with both cheddar and feta to send your mouth on such a whirlwind of tastes. I had the salad bowl to my face and scarfed that thing down. Next, was the Almond chicken strips. Chicken with nuts, that's quite a cocky recipe. However, it was amazing! complimented with a Dijon and Chipotle sauce. New combination of flavours; amazing!!!.  I also surfed and turfed with other people who accompanied me; and I must admit. If you are looking for combinations of flavours that are out of the norm and don't want to pay $$$.  This is the place to go. Far from generic. Even though now they are franchising and I probably will go thru the entire menu bit by bit and get bored one day. For now however, Union Social Eatery has been a very wonderful culinary adventure."}
{"text":"I came here with the boyfriend for lunch as we were tight on time.  It was my first time here and his second time visiting.  The restaurant was very busy considering it was a Friday afternoon.  Union Social Eatery is very nicely decorated with wooden tables, they had a variety of high top seating, booth seats, and bar seats.  We were seated immediately as we had reservations and once we sat down, we were greeted by our waitress, Trina.  She introduced the specials for the day as well as the drinks special.  Every day of the week, they have a drink special and today they had $15 Domestic Pitchers, too bad we both had work afterwards, otherwise we would've definitely split a pitcher between the two of us.  We both decided to play it safe and stick to water (how boring).  I decided to order the Grilled Swordfish Burger with their fresh, hand-cut Yukon fries. The Grilled Swordfish Burger consisted of hand-cut swordfish, topped with a mixture of charred leeks, grilled onions, roasted red peppers, and mayo.  The boyfriend had tried this before when he first came here, and he told me I'd really like it or hate it with it's distinct taste.  I definitely loved my burger because I finished it in literally less than five minutes (mind you I have never ate a burger that quick in my life).  He asked me to give it a rating out of ten and I without a doubt would give it a ten.  The fries were delicious as well, small bite size pieces that were crispy.  The boyfriend decided to go with the Killer Chicken Sandwich with fries.  I'm unsure of how to describe the sandwich as they made it differently as their daily feature.  He was kind of confused when he first got his dish because it looked like beef more than chicken.  So we asked Trina if the chicken is grinned into small pieces and made into a patty and she clarified for us that that is in fact how the sandwich is.  None the less, he also demolished his sandwich in no time so I'm guessing he enjoyed it.  If I wasn't in a rush to get to work, I would've enjoyed my food a little bit more, but regardless I would highly recommend coming here and trying out the food.  It's delicious!  Maybe next time when we come, we'll try dinner so we can get our drink on.."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and ordered the UFO burger (Union's fresh original), dragon roll and truffle fries.  The burger was typical and more on the bland side.  The dragon roll was a huge disappointment, as it fell apart once I picked it up.  I learn to stick with sushi, at sushi restaurants only.  On the contrary, the truffle fries were decent.  It had good flavour with the seasoning of herbs and oil.  I wish it had more truffle oil taste though."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for Summerlicious 2016 lunch, $18 for a three course pre fixe meal, and the experience was wonderful! All 3 courses were delicious and the service was amazing. I had the firecracker appetizer loaded with cheese and rib meat, the Thai chili sauce was a really nice complement. I had the steak sandwich and my boyfriend had the brie burger. The burger was actually quite unique, there's a hint of cumin and Indian spice in the meat, but the steak sandwich was the best by far. The meat they use for the steak is tender without being fat, and cooked to a perfect medium rare. Each bite was so good, would definitely order again!  And for dessert I had the Mars bar brownie parfait that is quite luscious and heavy and my boyfriend had the mint chocolate chip cookie sandwich. We were never short of water, and the general manager herself came by to smwelcome us, which I thought was a really nice touch :-)"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night and our server Lindsay was on point! We came with a big group of 15 people and they treated all of us with white glove service. I was curious to see how they would handle a big table due to the fact that they just opened a few days ago.  Nevertheless, the service we received was wonderful. The kitchen accidently made an extra short rib poutine and the manager came over and just gave it to us for free!  Now thats service!  We also brought a birthday cake and they did not charge us a \"plating fee\" which some restaurants usually do to make a quick cash grab.  We told them we wanted seperate bills and they gladly accommodated us without a fuss or a disgruntled look from the servers.  I also liked the fact that our server confirmed our orders when she was not exactly sure due to our seat change movements.  Better to measure twice and cut once right?  Needless to say...I was impressed with the service!  The food was great! Everything on their menu is under $20 and very reasonable.  I ordered the Banana coconut chicken with a side salad and it was delicious!  The Korean Short Rib poutine was on point and contained a ton of Meat and not just fries and gravy.  The Korean Meat Tacos were great appz and just set off our night right!  I really hope Union Social eatery continues to stick around and bring people together.  It should really bring in an exorcist to get rid of all the bad spirits from the former Smokey Joes and Mexican place before this.    Goodluck Union!  I will definitely be back for dinner and drinks!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed eating here for the first time during lunch on a Monday.  My sister dragged my friends and I to eating here and what can I say? I was glad that she did. The vibe and setup of the establishment was what I really liked about this place; urban rustic. The playlist of songs were a good mix of the latest and throw backs.   We ordered the following:  Crispy Calamari - They were actually very crispy, not the rubbery sometimes soggy calamari that a lot a restaurants serve. The flavor was a 8/10 . As for the 2 dips that it came with, they were not to shabby but nothing to praise about. The portion size was enough to feed 2 or 3. Came with a grilled lemon with it which I thought added a nice touch.  Nachitos - Didn't get to eat much of it because my friends are savages but from what I got they were just your typical GOOD nachos served with fresh salsa and sour cream.  Almond Crusted Chicken Tenders - They're apparently the popular choice for a lot of the customers and I can understand why. The tenders were excellent. A good even crust over the chicken without over doing it where you seem to get more crust than the actual meat which was juicy and tender. The flavor was a little too light for my taste but the 2 dips that went along with the dish, maple Dijon and their U.S.E. sauce added the extra flavor it needed. The Dijon was a little strong for me but the U.S.E. had a nice sweet taste.   Parmesan Truffle Fries - Honestly no words. Just order it! You will want to order just a plate of it alone.  Overall I will definitely be coming back here. An awesome place for brunch, lunch and dinner or a night out. Perfect place to bring a date or a group of friends."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but nothing special...service was kind of rude at times and price was pretty average but overall was an okay experience."}
{"text":"We love it! Fresh, nice and great service! The food was delicious... Try the chicken tacos taht has the asian dressing... Wow!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"USE is hopping in a strip mall of 14 other restaurants - one of every food type.  If you wonder what all of the cars in the parking lot are for, they are likely noshing and imbibing at USE.  The vibe is hip.  We were greated warming by a hostess who seated us and then proceeded to make recommendations for what to try (since this was our first meal here).  It turns out that the hostess is also a server and an expeditor.  We took her recommendations and let me say Jenna makes excellent recommendations.   We started with fried wontons with short-rib meat, cream cheese and other stuff.  Very good!  I had the fish n chips - it is way too big for anyone to finish and feel good about their cholesterol.  My dining companion has a swordfish burger that looked awesome (sadly, he didn't offer a bite).  He also swapped the fries for a sushi roll - what a novel idea!  Service was friendly, drinks were good.  Prices were very reasonable.  If I didn't know better, I would have said we were downtown YYZ.  It is a great place to know for when we are in Mississauga."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a late night bite, this is the place to go! I recommend the tacos on the night time special. Had a great dining experience here in a late Friday night."}
{"text":"I saw this place in yelp and suggested to my friends to try it. We are so satisfied with the experience. The place is cozy and clean, music is not so loud. Service is very efficient and very friendly. We have mediterranean dip trio and crispy calamari for starter. For main course, we ordered almond crusted chicken, herebed brie double chicken and epic cheeseburger. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I had the killer chicken sandwich and it was delicious!! The name does the sandwich justice. Highly recommend anyone going here for the first time to try it out. Also had the Parmesan truffle fries, absolutely loved the fries but didn't really taste anything else."}
{"text":"If there was a .5 i'd give it a 3.5 - Come on Yelp - let's get it together! Back to the review, This place is a solid pub, great renovation and the atmosphere is perfect.  The menu is large and the drink menu equally large.    On saturday they have kicking cocktails which are $2 off but from the menu it looks like choice vs. kicking is just a nomenclature for single or double - so my wife ordered a choice cocktail but made it kicking and it turns out they don't roll like that.  I ordered a bottle beer but they brought a pint (not a big deal) but then my second beer a bottle of MGD tasted a bit off.   We split the nachos which were by far the best thing we had - extra points for the tortilla bowls. The waitress wasn't having a great night because of the drink mixup and the attentiveness could have been upped a little (took a few tries for the ketchup).  It sounds harsh, but the place was at 1/2 capacity.  We ended up splitting the veggie burger and upgraded to the parmesan truffle fries - solid burger and fries nothing spectacular but i left really full!   great value, great ambience, but the waitstaff, bill error (which was rectified), the beer / spirit mixup was a bit of a downer.  I'd go back with a group."}
{"text":"I had a chance to check out this spot a couple of weeks ago and I was so impressed with the food. I got the Chicken Penne which tasted great with the feta cheese. The pricing of the food is decent. We had reserved a table from opentable, so we got our seating right away. It was fairly busy for a Tuesday night. Our server was helpful with the menu and helping us choose but after our food was given the waiter hardly came around. At one point we didn't have water and we were asking other waiters if we could get some water. Asides from that we had a good time, the atmosphere is a little loud so holding a conversation might be a tough. Overall I loved the food, I would love to give it one more chance."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday after work with some coworkers. Ordered the sliders and it was pretty filling. The portions are pretty big and it fills you especially the burgers.  The server was really great and polite as well. It was a little busy and loud but she checks up on us to see if we needed anything.  Great after work place. We always go here!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. We come here a couple of times a month. It is a lively atmosphere even on a weeknight. There is a bar with several t.v.'s for sports, lots of booths and a warehouse feel. The servers are very friendly, and the food has NEVER disappointed.  We love the chicken carbonara fettucine, but we hold the peas and add mushrooms.  The almond crusted chicken fingers are great, their fries rock. I've enjoyed their burgers, which are fresh made, and I love the candy house salad. Their specials have always been great as well.  The prices are fair, and you are getting gourmet style food, all made fresh. The desserts are delicious as well. The cheesecake is great and the creme brulee changes in flavour weekly, and is awesome. I highly recommend a visit to this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Over priced food with very small portions. I had the nachos which were very small and very boring, not worth the money. I also had the white truffle fries which were very dry. Our server was okay, not great. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"It was my first time to Union Social Eatery last night and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  When I first saw their menu I was sort of wondering how a place could have such a diverse menu from such things as sushi rolls to vindaloo chicken to swordfish but yes they do it.  I can't speak for all the menu items but we did get a chance to try a lot because Kris (GTA CM) held a CM event and as usual treated us to an array of apps which were generously passed around for everybody to try.  We had nachos, truffle fries, wings, flat bread, calamari from what I could remember.  The quality of the food was great.  The wings were really different but they were divine.   While I was speaking to everybody I could, Bilal who I've met only once before said he was a regular there and he highly recommended the swordfish burger.  I had noticed there were several menu items featuring the swordfish (swordfish tacos, swordfish burger and swordfish dinner).  I had to take his word for it because he said it was awesome.  I had ordered my swordfish burger which came on a really interesting bun.  Like an Ace bakery bun but not as spongy as a ciabatta.  It was almost as if it was just baked and it was great.  The swordfish burger was grilled and was topped with charred leeks, grilled onions, roasted red peppers and mayo.  It was a great combination and the swordfish wasn't dry.  The last time I had swordfish it was a thick cut but was dry but it was at a different place.  The fries that normally come with the meal are Yukon gold but I had subbed it with their version of poutine.  It wasn't a great poutine since the cheese they used seemed to be shredded cheddar, I could be wrong but for sure it wasn't cheese curds.  Still the burger was awesome and is a really nice change from the everyday kind of sandwiches I would have or would have access to.  I chose the swordfish because I don't have the chance to order it often and this menu again was very diverse.  They even had options to sub out your fries for a sushi roll instead for an additional charge.    What made the night special is that Mondays they feature craft beers and this evening it was Great Lakes Brewery's \"Yel-PA\" as in Yelp Pale Ale.  This was a specially made beer for Yelp coordinated by Kris and Great Lakes which is offered at select restaurants in the GTA and also available at the Great Lakes Brewery store near Queensway and Royal York in Etobicoke.  One dollar of every Yel-PA sold is being donated to the Daily Food Bank while supplies last.  This restaurant while it was a CM event was also a really nice place to get together.  We had a group around 11 or 12 and from what I could gather everybody was comfortable and the evening was filled with great food, great drink and great conversation.    Union Social Eatery is a nice facility which has good lighting and a good all around vibe.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  We didn't have to wait long for anything as service was great.  I can't say I have anything negative to mention at all.  The place was great all around.  I would come back here to try more of the menu as one meal for me here just won't be good enough."}
{"text":"Everyone was curious about what exactly the House Braised Short Rib Firecrackers were. It turned out to be extremely delicious and I wish I had more! These were assembled to look like 'firecrackers' on the outside -- the ones you pull and they crack. It had jalapeño-Montrery Jack, cream cheese, grilled Bermuda onions, cremini mushrooms, with a sweet chili sauce on the side. It was basically cheese, onions, and mushrooms all wrapped up together in a firecracker shape which was absolutely delicious. The jalapeño-Montrery Jack cheese and cream cheese were so delicious. I'm a huge cheese fan so this absolutely fit the bill. Yum! Like I said, I would definitely recommend these and order them again."}
{"text":"I was very excited to see that a new restaurant had opened up near our 'hood. And one that seemed to have some pretty good veggie options to boot! Union Social Eatery is pretty much your classic pub fare with a few 'gourmet' twists. For example, the Parmesan Truffle Fries. I was SUPER excited to try these. I love Parmesan. I love truffles. I love fries. How could I NOT love these??! Well let me tell you. The fries were of the deliciously crispy and thin variety, however, the truffle flavour was a bit lacking and the parm was pretty generous, but not melted onto the fries enough so it was semi-hard to eat. All that to say, I did quite enjoy them. I would just say there is some room for improvement.  For a main I had the West Coast Veggie Burger. As far as veggie burgers go, it was good, I mean, I ate it all. Nothing to write home about, but just a good standard veg burger with all the fixings! It did COME WITH avocado, which is a major bonus in my eyes. Usually that shit is extra. I would like to actually give them a rating of 3.5 just for that.  Oh also, the pimm's cup! Not outstanding but just happy to see it on the menu. Love me some pimm's.  All in all I will definitely go back when I am craving some pub food next. I think I will try the nachitos, as that is the next logical step."}
{"text":"I dine here regularly for business lunches and am satisfied overall with my experiences.   Food: tasty, quick, large portions, salads are substantial and delicious  Service: average Atmosphere: nice layout, comfortable seating, above average noise level"}
{"text":"Solid find in Mississauga.  We arrived well after midnight and the kitchen was still open.  Ordered the fish n chips to share and two cocktails.  Drinks were excellent.  You can tell they use quality ingredients and mixers.  Fish n chips were impressive-- the halibut was a healthy portion, fresh and the beer batter used was malty and crisp. Our server was pleasant and didn't rush us at all considering it was almost closing time."}
{"text":"Visited on Sat Oct 7 for dinner. The place was about 80% full. The place looks very nice and bright.   Pros Attentive and friendly service from the staff. Some very unique dishes on the menu.  Playing the Leafs game on the big TV's. They had at least 4 TV's, 1 not working though. Banana coconut crusted chicken breast was unique, some of the edges were a bit burnt. Not enough vegetables for a side dish, and bit too much rice.  Smokehouse deluxe beefburger - Definitely big, and literally a two-hander.  Half pound calamari is enough- comes with a choice of two sauces tzatziki or chili, we asked for both and they give us a bit of both :)  Cons Downstairs bathrooms. Somersby rhubarb tasted amazing but was $8.48, a bit steep IMHO.  Parking can be difficult in this area.  Didn't have audio for the Leafs game. Not a five star IMHO due to the high prices.   Protip - They have a private room that can seat about 20 -30 people.   Damage -  $72 includes tax, before tip"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: U.S.E. is reminiscent of your typical noisy pub with a slight hipster flare.   SERVICE: The service here is okay. You'll get what you need and in a reasonable amount of time.  FOOD: The fare here is both high quality and highly varied in choice. If you desire traditional western food, you can get things like poutine (with short rib on top) and burgers (also with short rib on top). This place also places a neat twist on otherwise normal foods. For example, my gf got their naan Philly cheese steak with a garlic aeoli sauce. Hands down that was the best Philly cheese steak I've tasted.   VALUE: The food quality is high, and the portions are sizeable, so you get your money's worth here. It's definitely worth a second trip."}
{"text":"Well after reading so many wonderful reviews of this place, we thought that it must be a hidden gem in our neighbourhood, and after a couple of days of looking at the menu online and salivating, we decided to pack up the kids and go to Union Social Eatery.  First mistake was bringing the kids.  Though there is a kids menu the environment wasn't exactly kid-friendly.  The host kept seating people near us, who then promptly asked to be moved.  My wife was perturbed that on the website there is a gluten-free menu, but in the restaurant there is no hard copy of said menu.  The waiter did rattle off the bulk of the gluten free menu, but my wife still had to resort to using her iphone to look at the menu online.  I had the thai red curry bowl.  It was ok, but not the kind of meal that makes angels cheer, maybe the other yelpers had set my expectations too high.  I've had much better thai curries - in thai restaurants.  My wife had the gluten-free club, which she said was ok, but not amazing.  For dessert we had ice cream.  Good old fashioned vanilla ice cream.    The union experience was ok, but we aren't in a hurry to repeat."}
{"text":"We're in town for a corporate training and we say to a local. \"We need place to eat and we prefer something local\" The response was \"Sorry Mississauga is a big box kind of town\" Thank goodness for Yelp and the recommendation of my fellow Yelpers. We really enjoyed USE. Service was great. Food was an odd varied mix of unrelated cuisine but somehow they manage to pull it off. I had the dragon sushi roll and a spinach salad. Which by the way, here's a tip: All of those entre' salads you see in the menu are also available as side salads. You won't find that info on the menu. Lucky for me the staff is really friendly and helpful and they work together to make sure that all guests are happy. Quite a rarity. Our group of 8 fit in here just fine and everyone had good food and a good time. Isn't that exactly what you want in a restaurant?"}
{"text":"I actually only found this when I got lost in the area, and made a mental note that this might be a cool place to eat. What drew me to it was attractive is that it's not your typical Keg, Moxies, Milestones, Caseys usually found in these industrial areas.   I was super glad because my work team asked where would be a good place for a celebration dinner, and I would have hated to go to a chain restaurant.   It's been open for only 18 weeks. Our server was super friendly and emphasized how they use fresh ingredients and make almost everything in house.   Their menu is diverse with everything from burgers, to flatbread like pizzas, mains like pasta/steak etc and even some dishes with an asian flair.  AND gluten free pasta and flatbreads are available at no extra charge. Excellent.   I got the GRILLED SWORDFISH BURGER ($12.95) something different. Covered with chilli mayo, grilled onions and leeks, and cherry tomatoes. It was yummy. Also helped my co-worked added some steak jus mushrooms on top. YUM.   From what I heard along the table,  The Epic burger apparently wasn't that epic. The coconut mango chicken was tasty, and a little different. The sushi was really good.   Great place for groups, drinks (they have a few large common tables), and work events.   I actually really want to come back and try their dessert!  The only thing that was infuriating was that the music was so loud. I was shouting the whole time and whts worse it was even louder in the bathroom  Everything was great ! I hope they can keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Tried the Atlantic salmon and chicken tenders. Finished with a Creme brûlée. Great! Ask for Charlie, the friendliest, helpful-est waiter this side of the planet! 12/21 update And now Charlie's the manager. Things can only get better. Great steak Charlie-boy!"}
{"text":"Overall, the experience was good. The nachitos were ordered as the appetizer and I loved how the salsa and sour cream was served in little tortilla bowls! I had the West Coast Veggie Burger and my partner had the Smokehouse Deluxe Burger. My partner actually said that the burger was better than The Works! Both burgers came with fries that were crispy and cut thinly.   Definitely a nice place to go with friends!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, enjoyed the rooftop patio. The food is good and prices are reasonable but I wish they would have put in a nicer bathroom - for those familiar with the history of this location, the stalls are the same as Estrella and Smoky Joes but with a fresh coat of paint. Recommend the burgers!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: this place is like a more hipster Moxies. Got seated near the bar which gave me a nice view of the restaurant and outside as well. Near back hey have a sliding barn door which leads to some additional searing. There are tvs around he top of be bar,perfect for game night.  Food: came on a Tuesday, they had $5 Sapporo. Everyday is a different drink special, would have been nice if they had a good special since I'm not really a big drinker.  Ordered the BBQ Short Rib Poutine which although was an app was huge and really delicious. I also ordered the wings but wings are wing so nothing to write about."}
{"text":"Service - the service at union social eatery was great. Our waitress was very kind and attentive. She was very friendly about my taking forever with he menu and also had some great suggestions. The food was also delivered very quickly! Even for being busy it didn't take at all long for our app and meals to make it to our table.   Atmosphere - great place to grab a drink and a bite to eat after work or with friends ! As the name indicates union social is the place to gather! It was a packed house. The decor and lighting, a mix of modern, industrial was also excellent.   Food - The menu had so many mouth watering options it was hard to choose. I really wanted the bbq rib poutine but wasn't sure if I also wanted another dish. I love burgers and their burger menu looked fab. I ended up going with the prolly steak naan wrap and salad for a side. Their maple-pommey dressing was phenomenal. My boyfriend got the ufo burger (union fresh original) which comes with tomato lettuce onion pickle and special sauce, also with the house salad and phenom. dressing! We shared the poutine and I am so glad we did! It had cheese, bread and butter pickles, crispy onions, gravy. The mixture of the bbq sauce with the bread and butter pickles plus gravy on the fries so good. Bbq sauce and sweet pickles are right up my alley so this was perfect! The Philly cheesesteak naan was good. I would have liked it better if it had less of the teriyaki style sauce and more garlic aioli. The naan was very soft and the philly steak tasty still. I didn't try any dessert but with hopes of coming back to visit this area again I will try it then! Their plate sizes we are also perfect. Not too much food and not too little.   Value - AMAZING value for the excellent service and the food!  The prices were good for their portion sizes. We are in town for our anniversary celebration. I wish the states had a USE! I love American food places with unique menus and burgers. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is hovering between a 3.5-4 stars rating.  I came here last night with a group of friends and this is my first time here despite me always seeing this place whenever I'm in the area. Upon entering, I noticed this place is pretty big and already packed on a Friday! We were seated in the area in the back and I ordered the fish and chips. I was told from my friend the food here is mediocre but the drinks are pretty good.   My fish and chips came with one long piece of fish (usually comes with two doesn't it? At other places), and fries and their fries are those thin fries. I also ordered a side of gravy. The fish tasted good but not the best I've ever had. But it got soggy near the bottom because some of the fries were under the fish. But my other friends enjoyed their food a lot. Our server was quick and efficient and did not hesitate when we asked to split the bill.   Overall, had a great time and would definitely come back again. PS the washrooms are all the way in the basement lol."}
{"text":"I originally booked my birthday dinner at the St. Clair location but when I found out that they were opening a location just down the street from where I live I was super happy so I decided to give it a try. Based on the reviews from the other locations, the service was very much consistent over at Yonge St. I knew it would be a hit or miss since they just opened up a week ago but I must say that I was thorougly impressed with the whole experience from beginning to end. The manager opened up the 2nd floor early to accomdate my large group just so that we have a bigger and more private space. The manager from the Yonge St. and St. Clair location even came by to greet me and make sure that I had everything I needed. Our server Lindsay did an awesome job taking care of my party and also confirming our orders to make sure everything was correct.  She was friendly and very attentive. They accidently gave us an extra order of poutine but the manager decided to gave it to us for free instead of taking it back. Overall, the food was pretty decent. I tried the Banana Coconut Crusted Chicken, Lemon Dill Salmon and the Korean Beef Tacos, all of which were tasty. What I also really liked is that all the menu items are $20 or less so it's perfect for a casual night out. I definitely want to come back to try out other food items and check out the beautiful patio."}
{"text":"I came across this page as a recommendation from Yelp, and considering it had over 150 reviews and the average was strong, I thought it would be a good idea to check it out. We arrived at 8pm on a Friday night, and the place was booming. We left our name and were told it would be 20-25 minutes for a table. We sat at the bar and ordered a drink.  The interior and decor was very minimalist and welcoming. It kind of had a Moxie's feel to it, only less of an attempt at \"high class\" look and more for the average folk. Our table was ready within 10 minutes, and our tab was transferred over without having to settle up at the bar before leaving.  We ordered the Almond Crusted Chicken Tenders, and the Chicken Penne. Within minutes of ordering, a person approached us with an appetizer sized plate. She introduced herself as the manager, and she said she heard it was our first time visiting Union. She gave us a complimentary order of the House Braised Short Rib Firecrackers, which is the featured item on their appetizer menu. The Firecrackers were very tasty, and hit the spot while enjoying a cold drink.  A few minutes later, they brought out our food, except instead of the Chicken Penne the waitress thought we had said \"Chicken Panang\" as in the Noodle Bowl. I'm not sure how Penne sounds like Panang, but to her defence it was fairly loud. The Noodle Bowl looked and smelled enticing, so we decided to keep it. The waitress offered to send it back and get our desired dish out ASAP, but we declined.  Not even 2 minutes later, the food manager (different than the first manager) came out to address the issue. He asked if we were sure about keeping the dish, and asked if we had a chance to taste it. He offered to allow us to taste it and decide if this was something we wanted to eat or if we wanted the actual dish we ordered. As a general rule of thumb, I never send food back at a restaurant (regardless of who's at fault for the mistake) so we kept the dish. The Chicken Panang Noodle Bowl was good, but only if you like the taste of coconut. It was somewhat overpowering and very prominent in the dish. It's just hard to adjust to an Asian dish when you ordered and expected an Italian dish. Nevertheless, they checked on us twice more and we got a visit from both managers, which was very courteous and unexpected.  The Almond Crusted Chicken Tenders were great themselves, but I wasn't a fan of the house sauce that it came with. To each his own though, and I used ketchup instead. The fries were small and almost shoestring style... I prefer a thicker cut potato with more filling than fried outside, but again this is just how they choose to do it. The fries were edible and cooked to my satisfaction.  Once the bill arrived, we not only received the free Firecrackers appetizer, but they voluntarily took the Noodle Bowl off our bill entirely. In addition to this, they applied a $4.99 discount which was labelled \"FIRST TIME\" on the receipt. When it was all said and done, the bill should have been $51.29 plus tip and came out to $28 instead.  I was impressed with their level of customer service, as you usually don't hear from anyone beyond the waitress when an error is made. Not to mention the discounts, the free appetizer beforehand, and the overall speed at which the entire evening operated at. Even if I had to pay for the food in full, I would have gladly done so. Despite being packed and every table being occupied, they still went out of their way to accommodate a table of two in realizing their mistakes and trying to do whatever they could to make up for it. This type of service isn't present at most restaurants these days, so it was definitely nice to see for a change."}
{"text":"The noise level is quite high for a dinner place in terms of music.  We ordered the garlic shrimp taco, the flavour went well together with the avocado. This dish was tasty. And the house braised sirloin firecracker (egg roll wrap) the cream cheese was way too overpowering. I had one bite and didn't continue to finish the dish. Definitely not ordering this again!   The truffle fries was not hot enough and tasted dried. It reminds me of left over fries and reheat in the oven the next day. Also, I can't really taste the truffle. A little on the disappointed side."}
{"text":"Updated review after trying few food item: Burger was juicy, fresh, and awesome. Comes with delicious thin fries. Calamari on the other hand was not up to par and surely not worth the price. I will update this review as I try more food items here.  Check out my previous review in regards to drinks. Service, and overall ambience. It still applies."}
{"text":"This was a huge disappointment after reading so many good reviews. The calamari was rubbery and very salty. The bartender actually told me that rye and bourbon were the same when I asked if they had rye whiskey....if u like TGI Fridays you will like this place."}
{"text":"If you're in the area, this place is better than Jack Astor's, Milestones, and any other pub if you're looking for good quality, casual food.   Today I had the lamb burger with goat cheese and roasted red peppers and it was PHENOMENAL. The bun was toasted on both sides and wasn't greasy. The lamb patty was moist and the goat cheese pulled everything together. One of the best burgers I've tried!   The fries are of the shoestring variety and only once would I say they have been subpar (this is over 10+ visits).   If you come at the height of lunchtime, expect to wait for your food, but when it does come, you won't be disappointed! They get a 5/5 because they're always on the top of our list for lunch options.  Here's some other thoughts on items on their menu:  - parmesan truffle fries. very fragrant and delicious - hand-crafted gravy. so good, you can taste the beef   - crispy buffalo chicken tacos. comes in two, added fries for a meal. would get it again if I don't want to feel too heavy afterwards  - U.F.O. burger - epic cheeseburger - smokehouse deluxe - cease & desist burger. all the burgers taste very fresh; the cease & desist was by far the messiest, but also most flavourful. you really can't go wrong with any burger choice here  - ace high club. really good! the cranberry focaccia makes this sandwich awesome  - philly steak naan wrap. it's good, but I found it very salty.  - killer chicken sandwich. this changes every 2 weeks, had a bbq chicken (was good, nothing special) and chicken parm sandwich (was great!)"}
{"text":"Love their patio, so cute. Only downside is they don't have enough lights so if you're having dinner at night you're pretty much eating in the dark Food is above average, but wasn't as amazing as I thought it'd be and from what I've heard  The beef firecrackers were pretty good as well as their quesadilla except one of the pieces were really burnt... My SO didn't enjoy his chicken sandwich very much, I thought it was so-so Although I was too full to finish my main because of our two apps, my grilled Dijon salmon with rice was simply delicious   4 stars for the service though Service was on par, our waitress was super friendly and cheerful and was very helpful with the menu as it was our first time. Would definitely go back to try out their other dishes"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with good waiters. Had fish and chips and loved it. The house salad was great!"}
{"text":"Took out my girlfriend for a birthday brunch to toronto. Was delicious and good customer service. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I usually hesitate to order a burger in restaurants.  Luckily I took Kris U's advice on this one and ordered the Epic burger and added smoked bacon.  Wow, who would think that a top ten burger is in Mississauga.  Add that to a draft of my favourite beer, Flying Monkey Hoptical Illusion, made for a near perfect experience."}
{"text":"Slow service on a Tuesday night. Food was slow. Truffle fries came with tiny pieces of fries and cold, gravy ordered on the side developed a thin film within minutes of getting it, tuna sliders was inedible, burger was burnt, waitress was not knowledgable and slow. And...washroom ran out of paper towels. We will never return after this horrible experience."}
{"text":"I've been living in the Yonge/Sheppard area for about 13 years, and simply put, this is the place in the area for this kind of food (e.g burgers/wraps, chicken fingers, chips, salads, i.e white people food).  They do add some ethnic mix to their food, I've had their philly steak naan wrap which was pretty good.  The decor is very basic, but clean and comfortable.  There are plenty of TV's and a bar as well.  They have some decent discounts on drinks on certain days if you're into that.  Overall, good place to hangout if you're in the area and with a group that can't decide on what type of food to get.  It is much better than the Boston Pizza that used to be there and is miles ahead of the Jack Astor's down the street.  It is comparable to the Moxies that was nearby and closed down."}
{"text":"This used to be a Shopsy's way back when I used to work in the area (about 6-7 years ago).  They've done a huge renovation and the atmosphere now is quite chic, similar to a Moxie's or an Earl's.   Service: I came for a Sunday brunch and food was served fairly quickly.  Food: Ordered the breakfast burger. It was basically eggs, and panchetta with lettuce and tomato on an omelette.  The taste was exactly what you would expect with eggs, pork and lettuce and tomatoes.  However, what I liked the most was the bun. It was a bit sweet, but very moist.  It was great.  Verdict: Will visit again if in the area."}
{"text":"I did not even set foot into this establishment but the customer service I received was so atrocious that I did not want to, nor will I ever.   My friends and I were planning a surprise birthday party for another friend, and having worked in the restaurant industry for many years, I absolutely understand the difficulty of acquiring a reservation for 12 people on a Saturday evening at 6:30 (prime time!). I had attempted to book a reservation for 6:30pm at Union Social Eatery, but was given the option of 5pm only. I took the spot, as 5pm could have been do-able for the party. A few days later, there was a hitch in the plans, and the reservation needed to be pushed back. I called in asking if there was any way I could push back the reservation to 6 or 6:30pm. The girl who answered the phone put me on hold and all of a sudden a very abrasive gentleman was speaking to me in a very defensive tone. I was confused at first, number one I had never been yelling at the girl, nor had I been irritated, and number two, I didn't understand why I was speaking to someone different now, but, nonetheless, I asked him the other questions I had, which were: 1. Do you take reservations at a later time on Saturdays and did I just try to book too late? (I wanted to know for future reference...however this is now a moot point).  2. What if I decided to cancel the reservation and then became a walk-in party? Would that be an option?   The man on the phone had a very aggressive tone and was very rude to me. He stated over and over again that he would turn me away if I tried to walk in and he \"just wouldn't even take\" my party. Again I asked my question about the reservations (do they take them at a later time or stop taking them at a certain time to allow for walk-ins, every restaurant is different and I have worked at both types), but he ignored the question completely and repeated himself stating a later time wasn't a possibility. Again, having worked int he restaurant industry in varying capacities for a long period of time, and working in customer service for even longer, I know a thing or two about operations and how to speak to and treat people who are asking reasonable questions. Still, I said okay and thanked him, and the call ended by him stating \"well, maybe we can see you next time then\" and he hung up. I was confused because nowhere in the conversation had I ever stated I was cancelling my initial 5pm reservation. I just had an inquiry about having a later time and 2 follow up questions. I then received an e-mail stating my reservation had been cancelled.   I was too irritated to call back, so my friend who was with me at the time called back. He was just as rude and abrasive to her, and when she stated that he was being rude, he said that he was not being rude and that she was being rude. He also said that I had been just as rude and said that I wanted to cancel the reservation. She said that she was with me when I called and that I wasn't rude and  I did not say that I wanted to cancel. He proceeded to call her a liar by saying sarcastically \"sure you were\". I am absolutely appalled that anyone would ever speak to someone in this way, let alone representatives of a party of 10 others who would surely (and definitely did) hear about this. That is so much business that you are losing and an awful reputation to gain. I told all of my friends and family about this and vowed to never step into a Union Social Eatery, and they all stated they would do the same and told their friends and family.   Union Social Eatery, I had heard a TON of positive feedback about you, and you had been on a list of places that I wanted to try for awhile, but as the quote by the great Maya Angelou goes, \"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\", and this is most certainly true for me. I felt brushed off and seriously disrespected for no reason, and I will never forget that. Sorry, but I'm not sorry."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I was in yesterday with my boyfriend. Ryan was our waiter (sorry for the late review! You're the best!). He was super helpful and personable. I got the bacon chedder burger, and the Social Punch (super yummy drink our waiter Ryan actually invented). My boyfriend had the special - which was the seafood linguine - and a beer that Ryan recommend. We both enjoyed everything very much. As we were leaving, we both agreed that Ryan was the best waiter we have ever had... EVER!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our experience here for my best friends birthday. We sat a party of over 15 on the upstairs patio without a problem (booking in advance) and the service was great. They took care of all the details and made sure that everyone was happy while also being incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. The prices are very reasonable and they have good specials on drinks as well. The specials are on drinks we actually enjoy ;) ,for example $4 Corona on Monday, and the atmosphere is really cool. There is a fire pit with planters in the middle of the patio which is nice to sit by with a drink if the evening gets cold. I ordered the brie double chicken and it was delicious, as well as all the appetizers like the med trio dip (I love the black olive one), and the fireworks which seemed like a twist on a fried spring roll. Very creamy and crispy with some meaty flavour inside too. Delicious! Love it here :)"}
{"text":"A few years ago, Union Social Eateries started popping up around town. It is a pretty decent casual pub food chain of restaurants. I ate at both their Sheppard location and this St Clair location.  Service is top notch. Food is yummy. Atmosphere is loud.  Recommendations: any of their burgers with fries, chicken vindaloo fushion dish."}
{"text":"Work your way around the menu. You will not be disappointed. Steak frites is my guilty pleasure. But their pastas and burgers are just as good. The social dragon roll is amazing. Their fries are addicting. USE sauce is a game changer. And even if we're full my friends and I can't help but order a Mars bar brownie with mint ice cream to share if we can't survive our own solo one."}
{"text":"So my friends and I decided to come here to hang out, grab a bite and catch the games. The restaurant was kind enough to accommodate a party of 8 for a Saturday given we reserved on a Friday afternoon. So that's a plus. The venue used to be where Shoeless Joe was, if my memory serves me well. The decor is alright, nothing stood out for me? The noise level can be a bit less to have conversations with friends. We were seated in our reserved spot not long after we got in. The staff are very attentive at first and the shift/store manager even swung by to say hello.   We ordered our food and we waited. I ordered the fish and chip, the fish is huge and came with plenty of fries. I also \"caved in\" and order the gravy. This I like as the flavours are different from the usual ones I get from other restaurants. Back to the fish, it is just okay? I couldn't taste the Steam Whistle Pilsner batter too much. Fish was just okay. Nothing super thrilling about it.   I believe this place is more for hang out and grab a drink than people coming here for food. Will I come back? Yeah for hang out and that's about it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night with a few girlfriends. Can't go wrong with their $6 martini special. I had the pornstar and it was really tasty.   We sat on the patio and it was very nice. Ample seating and nicely furnished. There was a firepit in the middle, but it wasn't dark or cold enough to have it on.   Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and happily answered all my questions about the menu and told me what was good and not so good. I ordered the curry rice noodle bowl with chicken and my friends ordered the almond crusted chicken tenders with fries.   My noodle bowl was good, but it didn't blow me away. It had a nice amount of chicken in it, but it wasn't too flavourful. The consistency for the curry was spot on, though.   My friends said they weren't too hungry but managed to finish most of their meal, so I'm assuming it was good. It came with a dijon dipping sauce and a chipotle aioli and shoestring fries.   We finished off our meal with their chocolate chip cookie and ice cream dessert. Three deliciously warm and chewy cookies with a generous scoop of vanilla bean ice cream (or mint, if that's what you like). It was the perfect size to share with three of us.   Our server was friendly and checked up on us frequently.  Would love to come back and hang by the firepit."}
{"text":"I recently moved in the area and have been here about 3 times now. Their service is great and their food is always good. Prices are reasonable. Definetly need to come here on a Sunday for Sunday brunch menu."}
{"text":"Saw the yelp review and thought I should give this a try, but the food was disappointing. We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share, which according to the waitress are the popular ones: short rib firecrackers, bbq short rib poutine, Korean short rib tacos, and crispy buffalo chicken tacos. The firecrackers was not bad, kinda like fried springroll with cream cheese stuffed inside. The rest of the appetizers are below average. The poutine was not hot enough, fries were soft and the gravy was a bit flavourless. Korean short rib tacos was just bad, all veggies, couldn't find any short ribs at all. They should call this the veggie taco. Buffalo chicken taco was mediocre as well. Overall, below average food. However, I must say the staffs are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The moment you walk in its a nice clean atmosphere with great staff and the smell of great food greets you.   With nice seating and a great selection of drinks,  they do allow for a great variety of people to try new and exciting drinks. I recommend the Dark and Stormy.   The overall menu ideas are exciting and unique with Truffle Fries and some Tuna Ahi Tacos. Both dishes were cooked with excellence and the flavor of the tuna was great.   Overall the waiter was very accommodating and the experience was nice! However what makes the point to be lost from a perfect score is the price value and the amount of oil in the burger. If the prices were dropped a tad bit and certain meals used less oil to improve the flavor, it's a great haven for good food and good times!"}
{"text":"This review could have easily turned out to be a big fat 1 star but what Union Social did to make it better was super professional and great customer service.  So this was my first time visiting Union Social so I called the day before to make a reservation after hearing that Union Social can get very busy.  So I show up the next day for my reservation to come to find out that my name was not on the list.  I became upset almost instantly as I looked around and noticed how full the restaurant was and how many people were waling out so they didn't have to wait.  I knew that there was potential that we would have to dine else where.  I showed them my call history on my phone to make sure I had the right number and they agreed that I did.  After about 10 minutes the figured out that the manager had taken my reservation but accidentally placed it for a week from that date.  The manager approached me immediately apologizing and stating that he would have a table for me right away and that we were his priority.  He immediately asked us if we wanted anything while we were waiting.  Within 10 minutes he had us a table and told us that any apps were on him and he didn't care which ones.  We asked for nachos with both chicken and meat which is not on the menu.  He didn't blink and had that out to us right away made the way we asked.  He was extremely accommodating to us and his goal was to redeem himself from the mistake he made.   Now on to dinner.  Our actual waitress was super friendly and talkative with us and treated us very well.  There were a few times where the wit time for drinks was a bit longer than it should be but I don't blame her for that as the restaurant was super packed.  The group shared a plate of nachos.  The portion was a bit small but very tasty.  I ordered a Turkey club sandwich with bacon.  I expected it to be your typical triple layered club sandwich but it wasn't.  It was served on some cranberry Ace bun.  I'm not a big cranberry guy but this bun was incredible.  This sandwich left me wanting more.  The sandwich seemed small at first but then i realized how thick it was lol.  Th french fries were the best I have ever had and the gravy at first I didn't like it but the taste with the french fries made it a must have.  I feel that Union Social will become a frequent place for me to dine in the near future."}
{"text":"Meatloaf Lunch Sandwich special was HUGE! and delicious. We had a very pleasant business lunch and all four of us were pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday night.  Food was very good - had the Phlilly cheese steak in a Nan !! Love the combo of Nan bread and steaks/ cheese!   Nice ambiance and comfortable bar seats.  Good selection of beers on Tap"}
{"text":"It was our first time there today for dinner good atmosphere big screen TVs it has an upscale pub style to it. It has a wide variety of food like burgers, fish and chips salads, steak and sandwiches. Service and staff were outstanding and prices were reasonable. My wife and I had the fish and chips and the cease and desist burger both were awesome and large portions. All in all a good experience we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday over the weekend, it was a big group (we had 2 big tables) & booked in advance so we got the upper floor partially to ourselves (there was another table there for a birthday too) was good that there was some privacy. I came here before but i don't recall much of the experience, however, this time i really think it wasn't their day lol. Our floor was being served by 2 servers together.   **Tip: we usually park at Baton Rouge's underground parking. it's hard to find parking in that area, and at Baton Rouge the parking is $6 and is all the way till 6am the next day. beats having to park on the street and having to feed the meter every hour. BR is closer to the restaurant than the subway stn, but it's still a ~5min walk? which could feel much longer when you're walking in -20C.  **Tip 2: it's fairly close to Tsuijri! :) if matcha is your thing can def stop by on ur way leaving the restaurant.   Pros: - i liked how they made accommodations for bigger groups to be upstairs and to kinda have a private space (ours was shared with 1 other group)  - prices are not too bad  - servers were nice - felt bad for our server who had to deal with so many issues from our group in one night - killer chicken sandwich - saw this on many yelp reviews so decided to give it a try. it's a chicken sandwich that they switch up every now & then - i asked our server and decided to order it. my killer chicken sandwich was pesto chicken with cheese and roasted red pepper, was really good but it came a bit cold.  - i subbed the regular fries that came with it, for truffle fries. the truffle fries as a SIDE was like 3/4 of my plate! really generous portion and well worth it, the truffle fries were really good.  - the upper floor we were on had a big flat screen, good to enjoy the game while you're there    Cons: - drinks were a bit expensive in my opinion. they have the 'double' special on Saturday - you order a drink, and you can order a duplicate for only $2 extra. however this only applied to cocktails, would have been great if they applied it to their full drinks menu as their beers were a bit expensive in my opinion  - they messed up the orders twice for the other guests in our party - the first time my friend ordered a pasta, they heard this order wrong and gave him another pasta. they had to redo it & bring him the correct one. - the 2nd time, everyone's order at our table came with the exception of this one girl. she ordered a burger (the burgers came the fastest) and her burger was nowhere in sight, even the corrected pasta order above came. because we were upstairs, the servers dont come as often so we had to wait for them to come & flag them down to ask about her order. not sure what the mixup was, but they claimed the order was placed. the girl ordered off the Gluten Free menu ,which was a different menu, so perhaps her order was missed. (it's nice that they offer a gluten free menu, but the basic standard is to make sure the quality/service is not compromised). anyway her burger finally came when everyone else was almost done their meal, so they gave it to her for free.  - the A/C & heat in the top floor was horrible. one minute it was freezing, the A/C blasting out from the vent gave my friend a headache (she was sitting right under it). 10 mins later, it feels like a damn sauna. not sure why they had A/C on when it's like -30 outside, but the temperature was annoying.  - the guests on the 2nd table of our party - their food didn't come until we were halfway done our food. by that time, only their apps started coming. so we had our table finishing super early, having to wait for the poor girl at our table to finish her free burger, and then having to also wait for the 2nd table to be done their food"}
{"text":"Awesome short rib poutine. Super tender meat and quality cheese and vegetables over nice, crispy fries. $10 for a plate fit for 2 people to share as their entire meal. Long Island was great too."}
{"text":"This place is great. Friendly service and delicious food. It was our first time there and the waitress took the time to go through the menu with us and highlight several of the dishes. I ordered the swordfish burger and had the mars bar brownie for dessert.  The French fries are nothing special but neither are they bad."}
{"text":"What's not to like about this place. I love the fusion menu, steak with a dragon roll, yes please! Their fries are amazing! Spacious and trendy inside. Can accommodate fair sized groups, and the server we had knew her shit. They definitely don't water down their drinks!"}
{"text":"Game 4 ALDS series Toronto Blue Jays vs Texas Rangers, I was here.  Honestly, I didn't think Union Social Eatery would have such great atmosphere, but it did. It wasn't too loud, though I'm pretty sure people were just paying attention to the game.  The food here is good. I have been to the one down on St Clair. On this particular visit, we weren't actually that hungry and ordered three appetizers to share and pick at while the game is on. Maybe we were hungry though because the beef taco, fries and 1/2 pound calamari went pretty quickly. We then also got the cheesecake because... Why not? It was a very generous slice of cheesecake that's well presented. I enjoyed it a lot.   Our server was good and didn't seem to mind we just got a few things and were mostly there to watch the game. We both didn't drink anything except water and it was replenished frequently.  I like how they didn't over-crowd, even on a game night, I look forward to coming back here and having a proper meal."}
{"text":"I thought this place was good based on the 4* review on Yelp. It's got a decent atmosphere but man does the food  suck. We ended up getting the flat bread which was delivered to us cold. Then we ordered some tacos which were meh, the shrimp was not seasoned properly and pulled pork was drenched in sugar. They used dempsters tortillas for tacos and if you know tacos you know that doesn't mean real tacos. Don't bother until they fix the food. I'll be posting this on Google where I'm a local guide. First time posting here but it's my honest review."}
{"text":"Visiting from the states. Great place, I'm surprised it's \"only\" 4 stars. Noisy in a good way, great music. Good food, great service, very accommodating and a good value. Great waitress named Sarah Well done."}
{"text":"Shocked at the high Yelp reviews for this place. I came here with one other person based on a recommendation from a friend who's never steered us wrong. That changed today.  I came here with one other person for a weekday lunch. Expectations were kind of low walking in because the place was dank and smelled kind of musty. I noticed there were only one or two people working the floor, but there were also only about 4 tables the whole time we were there.  We ordered two items - one main and one app - and it took over 30 minutes to receive them. The person I was with asked for an update 30 minutes in when we were about to leave, because zero attention had been paid to us and we had no idea where our food was or what was happening to it. The server told us it was being plated and it came out a few minutes after. We would have left otherwise. As it was, we asked for the bill right then.  The food was warm but not hot. We had the blackened chicken bowties (too many peppers, sauce weak, chicken tasted a bit stale) and the short rib poutine (FULL of pickles for some ungodly reason, quite rich-tasting, soggy fries, not enough short rib). The food was not worth waiting for, suffice to say. Also, I felt that these items were a bit overpriced for the portions given plus the proportions of ingredients used.  This place sucks. First and last visit."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! The drinks are very reasonably priced too, only $2 extra to make any drink a double which is nice.  Get the banana crusted chicken, it's amazing."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. We're so glad something like this now exists in the neighborhood (that isn't a huge crappy national chain). Service, and food is always great. Trixie is literally one of the best servers we've ever had!  Prices are very fair too with great drink specials even on weekend nights!  My only gripe: Needs a better (local) craft beer selection! Only one choice is...not choice."}
{"text":"Tuesday night required no reservations.    The atmosphere was average - kind of felt like I was in a warehouse.    The mushroom burger was really good - tender and well cooked.    $5 Sapporos on Tuesdays.  Party time."}
{"text":"I am regularly at this location for work meetings due to the fact that the environment is quiet enough to discuss business, staff is friendly and most of all food is great. Only reason I gave 4 stars is because I got a Ceasers here and the rim was covered in a very pungent tasting cajun spice. Ceasers deserve celery salt...don't fix it if it isn't broke!"}
{"text":"We've been here many times since it opened.  The food is consistently good, and it's wonderful how family friendly the place is.  Strollers welcome, and the servers always take the time to play with my kid.  Kids chicken tenders is especially good (and we like the cups for kids milk/drinks)."}
{"text":"Was visiting a pal who lives in Mississauga so we ended up at Union Social Eatery for dinner tonight. For a Saturday night, it wasn't jam packed, but there were enough patrons. There's a bar and dining area so coming in for a drink is kosher here.  Pretty reasonable for a myriad of menu items. Service was okay. Our server forgot about our main, but we reminded him and it came out shortly after.  We shared the following: - Candy House Salad (goat cheese, chopped pears, goat cheese, figs, grilled peppers) - Epic Burger (cheeseburger w provolone and havarti)  Being in Toronto, there are many USE like restos so I wasn't blown away. It was a-ok. If you're in the area, check it out as your alternatives are Swiss Chalet, Thai Express, Sprouts, and one of the Firkin joints.  A solid three stars."}
{"text":"The place is cozy and clean, music is not so loud. Service is very efficient and very friendly."}
{"text":"I just came back from this place recently. The first time being here was amazing! I called pretty late to make a same-day reservation and they were completely accommodating, no attitude or anything from the lady on the phone :). I came a little later than the reservation as the traffic was a little busy, but they welcomed me without hesitation.The menu was pretty interesting in the fact that it was a little bit of a fusion - awesome drink specials too :) Everything was in your typical price range at these gastropub type places, not too expensive, not crazy cheap either depending on what you get.  I ordered the Brie chicken and my friend ordered the salmon. We each got the drink specials which was $7 for long island ice tea or kronenbourg beer. It was pretty good and our server told us they make everything in house (sauce, cheese, croutons, everything).    Our server's name was Joelle and she was so sweet!   She checked in on how our food was often and refilled our water promptly, basically whenever she saw it was running low. Amazing! Another lady came to us named Esther (manager I believe she said?) and she was really friendly too. She welcomed us for visiting for the first time and we even got a complimentary dessert ! Free chocolate dessert? My goodness! (Unfortunately I can't remember the lady's name that brought us the dessert :( I was just staring at that brownie! )    If you're ever in the area, I suggest visiting this place. Drinks, food are great- service is amazingly friendly!"}
{"text":"We were traveling through Toronto back to the States and saw this restaurant off the 401. We decided to stop in, since their menu looked really fresh.  We were not disappointed! Their food was fantastic. They have more food prep workers than they do wait staff, which tells you something about all of the fresh concoctions they are preparing.  I recommend the Brie Chicken. It was delicious. I hope to return to Toronto for real some time in the future and visit again."}
{"text":"I came here with a few girl friends for dinner after work on a Friday. This location is the st. Clair location,  very public transportation accessible and if you drive there is a municipal parking lot right across the street. The food was good and the service was good too. Our server was friendly and was able to answer all our questions. The interior decor was more of an chic urban lounge / pub.  The booths are big and spacious.  The price range for their menu is reasonably priced.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I went with a friend last night for the first time and had one of the best burgers of my life.  Before I get into the food, let's talk ambience.  This place strikes a nice balance between dark, sophisticated and comfy casual.  I imagine it is kind of like what you find at the Keg or one of those mainstream joints that marketers have spend huge bucks trying to make feel and look right.    The service was tops--A+ all the way.  And similar to what I assume you find at a place like Jack Astor's, the wait staff probably have day jobs as models.  Guys, get those eyeballs ready for a workout.  So what about the food?  We shared the fancy cat truffle parmesan fries as a starter.  They were OK.  I've had better \"fancy\" fries before but these might be right up your alley.  Next time I'd just go with regular fries and ketchup.  Instead of those regular fries, we upgraded to the dragon roll which totally hit the spot.  Nobody who is a fan of this type of sushi roll would be disappointed.  But the real star of the show was the burger.  This lamb burger is not a part of the regular menu but it should be.  Juicy and all around delicious.  There was some kind of minted goat cheese thing going on, red pepper--it was amazing.  No kidding, one of the best burgers I have had in a very long time.  We skipped dessert.  No more food would fit.  Good beer was on special for $5--they feature a some deal every night of the week.  The menu is great--just two sides and something for every preference.  This place really has covered all of the bases.  You could come here for a big meal, a snack (great apps), cocktails, beers, whatever.    Given the quality, the prices are well worth it.  Everything on the menu is under $20!  Friday, after work, had the place pretty busy with a healthy mix of office workers, families and dates, both new and older couples.  I can see this place working really well for pretty much any situation: first dates, girls' night out, watching the game with guys or wrapping up a Friday with office mates.  Highly recommended and worth the slight commute--it is a few steps from St. Claire and Yonge."}
{"text":"We went there on Saturday night with my family and it was so ridicules. First of all our server was very tired like she was more into sleep. So what ever we asked her shes like it's up to you, what ever you like, they are all good!!!Ok i know they are all good but between 6-7 good burger there should be 1 popular burger at least!!!! Then I got the fresh daily homemade burger and it was definitely not fresh and I doubt that was even homemade. Finished our food and I know you wont believe me but we were siting there for almost 30 minutes  for our bill, we asked our server and 10 other server to bring us our bill and non would bring it to us!! Hope they see these reviews and improve!"}
{"text":"Service is good. Lunch hour is wayyyy too loud for my taste. Food is average. Servers are friendly and ready to oblige. I wanted a few changes in my order and they were happy to do it. Dinner hours are less loud but something about the acoustics in the place, even the busiest sports bars don't seem that loud. Also, unless you get seated in a booth, most other tables are too close to other tables around. I still end up going here a lot as it's close to where I work. Tip- make a reservation, especially busy hours of lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Great patio! If you sit near the sides, you can see all the traffic along Yonge street. This location is close to the subway and offers street parking. The food is very overpriced and average. I ordered the seasonal creme brûlée and it was around $6. The avocado dip is really good though! Washrooms were also all the way in the basement."}
{"text":"Good beer/wine selection at affordable prices. Food is fantastic but wings were a bit greasy. Amazing Mediterranean dip plate, truffle oil frites, burgers and nachitos.  Service has always been exceptional."}
{"text":"Union Social was fantastic! Came here for Sunday brunch and there was no line. Got the caramel banana French toast with a  friend egg and smashed potatoes. The French toast was so soft and the caramel banana sauce was the perfect amount of sweet, and just mushy enough to essentially act as syrup (although I added some maple syrup cuz why not?). The French toast came with a strawberry yogurt shooter (had a strong mint flavor to it) and watermelon as well. I LOVED the smashed potatoes... Super strong rosemary flavor. I mixed it with some ketchup and Sambal and Sriracha and it was great. I got so much food I actually had to pack the potatoes and take them home so the entree should definitely be enough on its own. The whole place has a really nice rustic western feel, with Edison bulbs on the ceiling and hard aged wood interior decorations. Beautiful place, beautiful food. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Tried this with two famished young kids.  Service was exceptional, friendly and efficient.  The kids menu (not printed) is real food and a step up from any other we've experienced.  The staff were welcoming with the kids and the din was just right to muffle any loudness while still allowing is the hear each other - a rare balance.  The food - wow.  We have loved everything we've tried there- the pasta dishes were both delectable and I am still trying to recreate the mars bar brownie at home.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4 stars. Went for a few pints and eats, and was very satisfied with the results. Everything on the menu is under $20 (pre tax) so its at least not going to break the bank going there. In my case 2 pints, flatbread starter and sandwich main came to just over $50 including tip.  Started with the Smokey Chicken Flatbread. The first and last bite had me thinking \"mmmm smokey bacon\" so no complaints there as a bacon lover. As a main, I went with the turkey club sandwich that came on awesome Ace Bakery cranberry foccacia bread. Very good and the turkey was thick cut deli style but in this case I wish the bacon was a bit more noticeable like it was on the flatbread.   Interior is nice, lots of reclaimed wood or brick walls. For some reason I felt the place still lacked identity. Maybe because aside from the nice wall surfaces, there was no art or lighting fixtures or really anything at all. Service was well intentioned, although a bit off their game in attentiveness. And I'm not sure how I feel about the name (something about Eatery reminds me of an environment similar to \"Moe's Family Feedbag\" from the Simpsons, but this place it far from that in reality). In the end, while I am rarely in the St Claire area - should I return I will likely come back here for my dining needs."}
{"text":"Second time here. still just... Meh It's a good environment to have a drink and burgers with friends. The waitress was attentive, cute restaurant and decor - but the food is really not great. Tried a few appetizers and mains - they are just \"ok\".  verdict: come for drinks and fries and chat with a friend."}
{"text":"Love this place! Came here on a Monday evening to beat monday blues... Food is amazing. We ordered a deluxe house burger and chicken penne. On Monday they have specials on beers (Got a bottle of corona for $4). They also made all the sauces and dressings daily in house which is a plus!:) Will definitely visit again.. I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"buffalo chicken tacos are the bomb! Service is fast. Love it! Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"So far I have yet to find something I haven't liked on the times I have stopped by while on town for work.  If you are tired of the chain restaurants and want a fairly priced place with awesome food.  This is the place."}
{"text":"This place is alright. The service is extremely nice, was greeted probably 4-5 times just walking to my table - not something you see everyday. The place is huge and I'd love to go to the patio in the summertime. Our waitress was very attentive and sweet.  Everything was on point, and they have drink specials every day. $5 sleeman pint saturdays!!  I don't think the food is very good. The 1lb of calamari was a huge portion but the taste was bland, even with the lemon squeezed on top. It was more crispy fried bits than anything else..  I also ordered the truffle fries, and although it being extremely oily, the truffle taste was not distinct at all. I've had a fair share of truffle fries and usually they're addictive af - I couldn't even finish this dish because it was so PLAIN. My friend ordered this poutine thing (not sure what it was, but it was on the starter menu) - it was so salty and he couldn't finish it either because it was too heavy. High cholestoral warning here, guys.  I'd return for the atmosphere and drinks but not for the food. Pricey AND not great."}
{"text":"I love having this place nearby because it is a great go-to. Food is great and I love how they change up the killer chicken sandwich so there's always something 'new' to check out. My ol' reliable is the Fish Market sandwich though. Burger fans I have been with really enjoy the burgers they cook. Really, the menu is wonderful when compared to the dullness of Jack Astor's down the street.  As the weather gets nicer, I look forward to hanging out on their rooftop patio. But even if it's full, they have nice seating by open windows right by the street. I'll definitely continue coming back here!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for catch up sessions with my friends and a few times with my family. I don't bring my parents to a lot of non asian restaurants because my mom is extremely picky, but this place she's been to twice (HUGE DEAL)  Every time the service has been great, and especially great on December 23rd (fully booked and reserved at lunch time) they were helpful and eventually managed to squeeze us in. The service was great, as was the roasted red pepper soup.   I have tried: Korean Beef Tacos (Meh, the slaw is a little bland) wings (only 2 flavors) are very tasty and good sizes two different soups and both were very chunky and delicious  their burgers were also very good the truffle fries were meh, no real flavor so it just tastes like oily fries  It's a bit expensive for lunch but for dinner it is a great place to stop by. They also have a good wine, beer and dessert selection!  Make sure you make a reservation, even for a week day :)"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a Thursday. As it was our first time, the manager came to our table and offered us a free appetizer. Not sure of the exact name of the dish but it can be described as beef and cheese spring rolls with sweet and sour sesame dipping sauce. Twas a nice opening gesture :)  We got two drinks to start, a cosmo martini (6$ for the Thursday special) and a Pim's cocktail. The cosmo tasted like pure (Smirnoff) vodka but the cocktail was delish.  For our main we ordered the UFO Burger with the salmon roll, the korean swordfish steak, and the spinach salad with ahi tuna. The burger was tasty and substantially sized. It didn't take my breath away but I was very happy with it nonetheless. The salmon sushi had way too much mayo and a bit bland tasting so I was a bit disappointed having paid extra for it.   The salad was good too especially with the seared tuna which was perfectly rare and very fresh, you can tell it was never frozen.   My favorite was by far the swordfish which was so tender, juicy and flavourful. Probably the best swordfish steak I've had in Toronto...  The servers were very friendly and chill. A very nice place to grab dinner and I will definitely be coming back again and again and again."}
{"text":"Love this place!  It's tucked away on St Clair, but they have great food and it's never too busy!  A cool atmosphere for having a couple drinks after work.  I personally love the veggie burger and the dynamite roll."}
{"text":"I like the concept of this place but the location is not ideal. The food was mediocre, wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Came here on an evening after work with some colleagues. The food was absolutely fantastic but we were seated next to the kitchen and it wasn't the most comfortable setting. The music is wayyy too loud, you need to yell at the person next to you in order for them to hear you"}
{"text":"Nice place to go for with fds. Noise level is high, so if you want to chat with your date, maybe not a good place.  Waitress is helpful and excellent service. Food wise is decent. Nothing special that will surprise you."}
{"text":"Located in the Yonge and Sheppard area, this gastropub features many delectable bites. I've been here several times including my birthday recently and have always enjoyed  Every time I've been here, I've ordered the Parmesan Truffle fries- definitely a must when you come here for food. It is so good that you need to make this part of your appetizer choice there. Every Sunday, they have $5 Hail Cesar's so a bunch of us ordered it- pretty good. They also have daily drink specials every day of the week and food specials as well.   Everything for my birthday went well from start to finish. The restaurant was able to accommodate a group of 12 of us in their upstairs private area which was nice to enjoy some privacy for the party.  From the service given by the staff here, the prompt food and drink orders, the ambience to the complimentary birthday dessert from the staff, it was memorable birthday for sure. It was great that they didn't include an automatic gratuity to the bill as we had a party size of 12 but I gladly tipped the server as she did an amazing job ensuring we were being looked after.  Overall, a very enjoyable meal and will definitely be a repeat customer in the future for sure."}
{"text":"I had another opportunity to try out Union Social Eatery again and had a wonderful experience this time around. I'd like to thank the wonderful team here for making our experience such a pleasant one.  We tried their Korean tacos which we were told they previously used sirloin beef but now switched to pulled pork. The pulled pork worked incredibly well with the Asian inspired slaw and the tacos were tasty.  I was moist and the balance of sweetness was spot-on. I admire the fact that this restaurant continues to evolve to make their dishes better.   The firecrackers are also a must order. It was perfectly crispy on the outside with a cheesy, gooey, meaty interior. It's so satisfying and the sweet Thai chili sauce brings it all together.   We ordered the steak special and the herbed spinach salad for our mains. The steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare. That gravy was an interesting sweet onion and shrimp gravy. There were veggies and we substituted the mash for truffle fries. The fries were great. The salad was lightly dressed and I loved the candied walnuts which added a hint of sweetness. The components of the salad were hormonious and thehe portion size was generous.   To end the meal off, we had the caramel brownie and creme brule. Both were delicious and were the perfect conclusions to our meal."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food in a sports pub environment with good (not great) service. I don't think the owners do enough to set themselves apart from all the very similar spots within a short drive, including not utilizing their unique branding to control and expand their market share. Very typically Canadian attitude towards business, unfortunately. Still, most certainly worth stopping by for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I came to Union Social Eatery as a recommendation from a friend. The moment I walked into the restaurant, I immediately felt welcomed. The servers treated me like VIP. Since I came in alone, I was expecting to be seated at a small, two person table somewhere towards the back of the restaurant. To my surprise, my server was kind enough to seat me at one of the larger tables towards the front (granted it wasn't very busy when I came in but it was still a very nice gesture)!   What I really liked about the menu is that it contains a wide variety of cuisines - Italian, Japanese, Indian, French - and all for affordable prices! I decided to order smoked salmon sushi for my appetizer, the curry coconut chicken steak as my main and crème brûlée for dessert. I'm usually pretty critical when it comes to restaurants that have mixed cuisine on their menus. I was pleasantly surprised once I tried the food that I ordered. Everything was delicious and tasted fresh (which is something that is becoming increasingly rare amongst restaurants nowadays), especially the curry coconut chicken!  Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at the new Union Social Eatery. The servers were very accommodating and made friendly conversation as I waited for my food to come. The food was excellent. I look forward to eating at the Union Social Eatery again in the future."}
{"text":"Went here last night for my first GTA Yelp event and I had a blast. Special thanks to Kris U for organizing and Union Social for bringing us apps to try! It was great to meet new Elites and also to see familiar faces!  My favourite starters I sampled were the nachos, truffle fries, and fried calamari. Loved the dill aioli they had on the side of the crispy squid - yum!  For dinner, my bae ended up ordering the almond crusted chicken fingers with fries, which I stole a bunch of and loved! Two amazing dipping sauces, mustard and chipotle aioli, accompanied the tender morsels. My green dragon roll was a-ok, not sure I would order it again but it was decent for a pub ;)  Loved trying the Yel-PA beer, it was very good!! Too bad its only a limited edition! Get it while it lasts people!!  Overall, staff were very friendly, restaurant was clean, and I would return for drinks and food when I am in the area! Thanks for a great night!"}
{"text":"Steam whistle is life! When you have steam whistle for $5 on Sunday and serve steam whistle battered fish and chips.... Sold!!! I love this place. Food is really good and the service is on point. Truffle fries, fish and chips and almond crusted chicken fingers are a must try. Nice casual dinning experience with nice decor :)"}
{"text":"Great PR and service. They want to please their clientele but, after two meals while on a visit to Toronto, their food just isn't good enough. Portions are huge - my friend and I tried to share the flatbread starter and, with great effort, barely ate more than half. They can do better. But kudos for caring."}
{"text":"Met Pam for lunch here on one of my off days. Even during the rush there's plenty of seating, and we were seated right away. I found the waitress and hostess very friendly. Once we ordered the food came in about 15-20 minutes, which I also found very nice. I ordered the garlic roasted Caesar salad, and I forget what Pam ordered but I did post a few pictures. I do remember the food being quite delicious. Would definitely return if I was going back to Mississauga. Reasonably priced for what you're getting. This also looks like a great spot if you're taking your prospective hire out for a job interview, although could get loud at lunch."}
{"text":"I took my family tonight for dinner and feel I must give this restaurant 4 stars. I was very tempted to give only 3 stars because the noise level is unbearably loud. However, the service was excellent, the food was tasty and plentiful and the manager was charming when the noise issue was mentioned on our way out. Clearly, this place is professionally run and the staff has been well trained. The ambiance is fine but surely they could find a way the buffer the sound down to an acceptable level where everyone doesn't have to shout. Perhaps some soft panels hanging from the ceiling...? The food and service were good enough that I will give it another try on a less busy night. I hope it is better as I would like to make this place a regular spot for a casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Great place and great service! And the prices are actually not bad at all. Good for dates and nights out"}
{"text":"The best place that I have visited in Canada. Maya is by far the best bartender I have conversed with in a while. Her knowledge of the craft beer options and her banter ensured that I will be back to enjoy the drinks and food. Such a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and both experiences were very good. Yesterday I was on the hunt for Nachos, I decided after getting the Canada Day email about nachos that my fun meal Friday needed to include nachos! Since this place was listed and I hadn't been in about a year I thought why not!  It is a relaxed casual looking place, good size and can accommodate groups. I made a reservation via open table. The waitress was really knowledgeable and friendly. Now the nachos were actually kind of disappointing hence 4 instead of 5 stars. The portion is small, I would be weary sharing with more than two people - refer to the photo, I think it shows the size pretty well (also very expensive for the size). They put a ton of shredded lettuce on top, I am not sure why... Could def do without. The jalapeños were great, the cheese was a little too greasy, but the chips had a good crunch.  The nachos were however made up for with the mains. I got the veggie burger with the truffled fries. I actually was worried for a second when I bit into the burger if they made a mistake and it was actually beef! But nope they just do a really good veggie burger! The toppings on it were top notch! And the fries are really good, with shaved cheese and rosemary. The other main was the almond encrusted chicken tenders, which I was told were very good as well, and generously portioned.  Point is this veggie burger gave my favorite veggie burger a run for its money, that's saying a lot. It was huge too."}
{"text":"We joined their NYE celebration last night, 5 adults and 4 children. The atmosphere was right, the meals were yummy but I was most impressed by their high attention to detail when it came to customers! Our waitress was phenomenal! Super patient, caring with our little ones and made us all feel welcome. That to me its a winning place that will have me returning and recommending it to my friends. There was a DJ so we all danced and free champagne to toast the NY. All in my party left happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"Union Social Eatery was great! There was a lot of space for groups there, a big bar, friendly staff, and delicious food. Everything you're looking for in a restaurant. I also liked the music they played here lol. I loved the drink specials. They had $5 pints and $5 pimms and ginger (I don't really know what that is, but I can assure you it was delicious and not overly sweet!). I will definitely be bringing my girlfriends here for a few drinks.  To eat we shared nachos with chicken (heavenly... and I'm not a nacho fan), and calamari which was absolutely delicious (weird, because I'm not a calamari fan either.  It was really good!). I also enjoyed the wings The service was wonderful, our server was great. She had our bills and debit machines at the ready. She was super quick and organized.  The only thing I didn't love was my pad thai. I found it sour, over vinegary maybe? It was only the second time I had pad thai so I'm not sure if that's how it's supposed to taste. It was about $15.  Still, I loved the atmosphere, the appetizers, and the service here. They made a great impression on me and I'm sure to be back!!"}
{"text":"It is odd that Yonge/Sheppard lacks trendy, decent places to eat. Union Social offers a great menu and a good sit down without being over priced. The service is great, no fuss if you have a complaint. I also think they have the best roof top patio in the area. Really good place to meet a small or large group. The cocktails are made with fresh ingredients (I had a Pimms with fresh mint sliced cucumber and lemon) - $6.81. Welcome to the area Union Social, keep doing what you're doing :)."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend who highly recommended this place.  He even ate here the day before taking us!  We ordered the buffalo chicken tacos, Korean beef tacos and the parmesan truffle fries to share.  I gotta say the fries were amazing!!!! I could eat them all day.  For the tacos I preferred the Korean beef ones more. It came with a type of slaw inside which was refreshing.  The buffalo chicken one reminded me more of a spicy mcchicken type of thing, but still good.  The great thing is that all tacos are only $8 everyday between 3-5pm. (Or maybe it was 2-5pm... Can't remember)  We will be coming back"}
{"text":"I'm amending my review from a 1-star to a 4-star. The full text of the initial review is at the end.  After my initial review was written, the manager at Union Social personally reached out to me. We spoke over the phone and he apologized for the situation. Most importantly, the manager:  1. Tracked down and understood the entirety of the event 2. Clearly explained that substance initially given to us was clean water with vinegar added to polish the already cleaned cutlery 3. Amended restaurant internal procedures such that it will not occur again  I'm very encouraged that Union Social took the initiative to contact me, to explain what had happened, and went the extra mile to prevent re-occurrence. Didn't expect this, to be honest..!  Based on these I'm happy to change the rating to my review.  _ _ _  _ _ _  (Full text of initial review:)  I'll be honest, the food was good albeit pricy.   But the food wasn't the reason I'm giving this place one star. We were given utensil cleaning water to drink. Read on.   When my girlfriend and I sat down we were given two glasses of clear liquid, in mildly dirty glass. It smelled funny and I proceeded to take a sip. A pungent smell filed my mouth and I immediately noticed I was drinking vinegar-like such stance. To a sip of my girlfriend's, same thing.   I promptly notified the waitress who took it away and apologized, then brought back actual water in noticeably cleaner glass. She then told me the water we were given before were for cleaning utensils!   AND I TOOK A SIP OF IT.   Food arrived and we paid. We only ordered one taco starter (two small tacos) and 1lbs of calamari to share. It came out to $31.50.   And nothing was done to compensate for the dirty dish water I was fed, other than a couple verbal apology.   Very cavalier about the safety of their clientele. Will not return. In fact should have walked out initially. It would have been the least the restaurant could do to offer up some compensations, as well."}
{"text":"I came here with my crew on Sunday evening for their summerlicious.  Their summerlicious dinner menu price is very competitive, $28 for three courses is very good.  However, the food I had was pretty bad. I ordered the Braised Short Rib Firecrackers to start, 8oz Grilled Bavette Steak as my main and Individual No Bake Vanilla Oreo Cheesecake.  To be fair, the Braised Short Rib Firecrackers was pretty good as I loved the flavour combinations and it had great presentation as it looked it was stuffed into a chicken wing.  Things went downhill from there.  The Grilled Bavette Steak came fairly well-done (the server didn't even ask how we like our steak, so i assume they are all well done?).  Despite it was well-done, it was not rough at all, however, the steak was VERY SALTY, I had to keep drinking water just to wash the saltiness away.  Dessert was even worse, I don't even know if I was eating cheesecake or just a pile of cream, the cream was so thick and it didn't taste good.  Both steak and desserts I didn't end up finishing.  I have to say $28 is good, but I would expect food to be a little better, yes I know it's cheaper than your average summerlicious restaurants for dinner, but I would rather pay the extra $10 or even $20 to eat something better."}
{"text":"The his restaurant is okay. Pretty standard. Nothing really is bad, nothing really is great. I have been for dinner with a large group and for lunch with 1 other person."}
{"text":"Place was very loud.  When we asked to switch spots they said other place was reserved, although table was same size and we had a reservation as well.  Guess the host had his friends coming in.  Ordered some drinks.  5 star prices for mediocre drink list.  At least they didn't screw up the wine.  Calamari was fried in a lot of batter.  Very small portion.  Burger was burnt and way overdone. Had to wait 15 min to ask for condiments.  It definitely a terrible burger experience.  Wish I ordered something else from another place altogether.  Overall a very irritating experience.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Very delicious and unique food choices to choose from.. Lots of flavour, good portions and very affordable prices. Service is fast and very friendly. I recommend everyone coming here for all ages. Would come back for sure and try all there other foods and deserts."}
{"text":"Delicious burger,  killer fries,  decent prices!  This place is a winner in my books!"}
{"text":"I really like this place because 1) it's in midtown 2) they make good food 3) our server Maggie was awesome - patient and on top of her shizzzzz.  One of my friends got his meal way later than ours and then his bill was messed up but she took care of it like a pro and made everyone happy. That's proper service, thanks Maggie!  They play mainstream EDM and I caught myself fist pumping at times but it was on a loop.  They need to extend their playlist but all in all a wicked spot to check out."}
{"text":"Terrible service the SECOND we arrived. We were a party of 11, but the hostess said she was not able to assist us because it would be over an hour wait(although a few tables are available). We decided to split our party so the process can somewhat be faster. This hostess claimed that even for that party she \"still CAN NOT\" help us. HA don't even think about this spot if you're with a group of friends!"}
{"text":"Burgers are amazing here and the only thing I come back for...fries are alright, chopped up like they were someone's leftovers but the most disappointing thing for me was their cheesecake. As a cheesecake fan and having been told their cheesecake here is good, I was disappointed with how burnt the graham cracker crust and how salty the cheesecake was. Honestly, it was only edible because of the blueberry and caramel topping but a good cheesecake should be good even without the toppings"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Mississauga.  Menu is always interesting and the food is made from scratch...burgers are really great here as well as their salads."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Love the music and the laid back style. Kind of has a coffee house vibe. Burgers were really good and the wait staff was outstanding. Great prices as well for the portion sizes. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's a hidden jem. A lot of the mains consist of chicken, but the variety is still pretty good. Desserts are good. Kids menu is good with good portions. They have a lot of unique apps and entrees, definitely not one of those places you go where the menu looks the same as everywhere else. It's kind of on the small side so on busy nights you can expect to wait a bit. The environment is nice. I would definitely come back here again. Also I ordered for pick up one time and they had my food ready in 15 mins even though it was busy. Both dine in and pickup experiences were pleasant and servers were very welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"My gal and I have been to this location many times. It's our date night place. The food is excellent. We usually order the BBQ wings and tacos and that in itself is a meal. The whole menu is pretty much good eating. We love the fact their food is original, the beer is always cold and the place is clean. Super cool staff always make our experience enjoyable"}
{"text":"Love this place I've been here three times over the years and every time my food taste great I've never had an issue service was awesome if you're in the area definitely try it you won't be let down I don't know if they still do this but when it was my first time and everybody at the table it was our first time they gave us a free appetizer to share for the table so that was pretty nice of them"}
{"text":"Have been a couple times and the food and drinks are great.  The menu is large and has a pretty wide selection from chicken fingers to sushi. It is a bar atmosphere with above average food.  They could use a few more TV's..."}
{"text":"Their mushroom burger was so good, i didn't even think about taking a picture of it because i was to busy enjoying it :)) i like how the french fries were served, tiny lttle cutlets. Service was excellent. It was our first time there, we told this to our super nice server Melinda. A few minutes after thst restaurant supervisor lady came and greeted us with some lovely treat, olive paste, sun dried tomato dip, hummus, pitas and chips, the pic i took is that one. They were all delicious."}
{"text":"I was told about union social eatery but a co-worker who knows my love of a good burger and it was delicious!  I\"ve been here several times and tried a bunch of their burgers and I have to say my favorite is the swordfish burger. It was very different and unlike most fishes, it was very thick and didn't flake apart when you take a bit from it. Their firecracker poppers are delicious and I order them all the time, I definitely recommend that you get these to start.  Their drink selection, isn't the greatest. They need more variety on tap and the cocktails were alright. If you're looking for a fancy burger you can find it here."}
{"text":"Really noisy restaurant - like so loud that i have to raise my voice to speak to my friends. The person who greeted us was very rude and bitchy, maybe she was having a bad day or something but she refused to serve us when we asked to have a booth instead of an open table. We got a much nicer waiter who checked up on us and at least looked happy to serve.   I ordered the chicken panang noodle bowl and I should've known better to not order any asian food at an american restaurant. It was not good at all... the curry was really salty and the flavor just made my stomach upset. Portion was really big though so i guess thats a plus.   This isn't really the place if you want to catch up with old friends and plan on talking alot. By the end of your conversation, your throat will be scratchy from trying to talk over everyone else in the restaurant."}
{"text":"A great spot to meet up with friends for a relaxed meal, drinks and conversation. They were able to accommodate my group of 8 without a reservation, no problem. Service was fine, the server communicated with us if an entree was going to be a while etc.... Their almond chicken fingers and truffle fries are delicious! Portions are a good size as well. Expect an average dinner with a drink to cost around the $30 mark"}
{"text":"I used to go there almost every weekend for lunch but had to stop due to always getting sick after having their chicken vindaloo and their UFO burger. A couple of times, the burger was not properly cooked inside. The manager came to our table and agreed about the burger being uncooked. She send it back to the kitchen and got a new one. This happened twice. Another time, the chicken vindaloo had no chicken on it. Manager came by and apologized.  Got a new one with chicken on it.  I tried to like this place but it seems it's always a disappointment."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  Not private all. Great menu. Great prices.  Lots of tvs. Best seat down restaurant of Meadowvale Open parking Not too busy"}
{"text":"Ok, so not the most glamorous place but ok ambiance for casual lunch or dinner. Short menu of the known staples made well."}
{"text":"My wife and I go here all the time.  The food is great as well as the service.  The prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Perfect ambiance, menu and service!  Everything on the menu is delicious and the staff really goes beyond to make your experience a very pleasant one.  The pictures speak for themselves. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"got the trio dip as an appetizer which came out in less than a minute with stale chips. Really hate feeling like i was served something that was just out for God knows how long. we requested more chips/pita which came out  25 minutes later with our mains. Was not checked up on once we actually had to call a waitress to even get our bill. Food was OK portions were good. Unfortunately the snotty service and atmospere left me with a bad enough taste in my mouth to write a review. Wont be back."}
{"text":"After passing by this place for a while I thought it was finally time to check it out.  To say I was underwhelmed is an understatement.    the decor is nice but don't expect to have a conversation here because it is loud.  I couldn't hear what the people at my table were saying and it felt like i was screaming.  There are 4-5 tvs here so of course it is going to be loud but I still like to be able to hear what the person is saying who is seated next to me.  While none of us were really hungry we decided to ordered a few apps - the trio of hummus dip; the smashed avocado dip and the vegetarian flatbread.  The hummus came with tortilla chips and pita bread and actually was pretty good.  The different types of hummus were really flavourful.  This was the best of the apps in my opinion from what we ordered.  The flatbread - not my thing.  The bread was hard, it was drizzled with balsamic vinegar (well maybe doused was a better word) and just fell flat (no pun intended..lol).  The smashed avocado dip wasn't too bad - but definitely a share dish as this would be too big for one person to eat.    The service was fine - our server was really nice but I don't think I would come back here.  If the apps weren't great I am not that curious to find out how the mains would taste.  Definitely a social place but other than that"}
{"text":"Great place, friendly and helpful service, and fresh food. Great menu made it hard to choose, but the server did a great job walking us through it and recommending. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and I feel like I've been consistently disappointed enough by the food at this establishment to finally write this.  Honestly the food is so sub-par and mediocre I don't know how they got their 4-star review...   The pro: The waitresses are nice?  The food:  Wings are mediocre, sometimes they come cold and soggy. Poutine is consistently mediocre, also sometimes come out cold and soggy. Truffle fries were pretty flavourless and disappointing. Smokey Club Flatbread was 40% flatbread, 50% lettuce, 10% assorted other ingredients. Burgers were okay. Beers are 'meh'--- do they water this stuff down or do I just become a tank when I drink here?   What else have I had here? I don't even know, it's not very memorable. Even one of their most popular items, the Sirloin firecracker, is mediocre at best.   Come here for pricey, bland, played out food trends. Just kidding, there are so any good restaurants on the street around this one. I wouldn't recommend coming here unless it's -30 C outside and every other place is full."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good and service was decent. But the girls bathroom was filthy and filled with bugs. Very unhygienic, only makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like, granted the dinning area is very clean.   It honestly seemed like a decent place, but I will no longer be eating there after that."}
{"text":"Traveling on business and in the area visiting MS and this restaurant is right around the corner...very central location and probably, easily the best fare for either lunch or dinner in the area.  Coming from a large city- this was somewhat of a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"I went to the St.Clair location and loved their burgers and was always meaning to go back - I was so happy to see that they opened a location in North York! Was walking by the neighbourhood when I saw the patio was open and decided to drop by. Turns out it is Opening Day. I am soo happy I can get my burger fix close to home. North York was in dire need of a good burger place.  What was surprising to me this time around was actually the Korean Beef Tacos. My date and I both agreed these were the most tender, juiciest beef tacos we have ever had! So! Good!   Service was great, everyone super friendly. I love the vibe here. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've never reviewed before. The food, atmosphere and hospitality here are so great I had to download Yelp to write a review. The meal I had was outrageously spectacular. I've never believed Mississauga had exceptional eateries but boy was I wrong."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm... can't stop thinking about my date's steak sandwich... The Tenderjack Steak Sandwich was a great cut of meat, nice and tender.  Topped with a jalapeño Jack cheese, chimichurri and arugula... It was so good. Tasty and satisfying.  I had the Banana Coconut Crusted Chicken.  It was also pretty good. It's pretty much what you'd expect.  We also had the short rib tacos.  But next time i'm definitely going to try the swordfish tacos...  They had quite a diverse menu with many unique items.  I look forward to coming back and trying the rest. We had a few drinks and the night was topped off with a delicious Mars Bar Brownie.  Warm chocolate brownie topped with ice cream... :)  The prices here are pretty good... especially for the quality. The service was very friendly and offered good suggestions. I was also surprised that the kitchen remains open quite late and still maintains its good quality. Looking forward to returning with a good crowd for drinks and apps... :)"}
{"text":"Came for drink as alternative to busier bars. This was also busy on sat night but was more spacious and lots of seats at bar area. Has social punch virgin tasted really good"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Atmosphere is great, food is wonderful, and super nice staff! It was our first night in Canada and they helped make it special for us. Shout out to our great server for giving us tons of city tips and thank you to the manager for that super sweet appetizer surprise. Definitely coming here next time I'm in town. Oh, and I had the chicken sandwich special! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Good place to go to for a quick bite, been here a few times. Great service and the food is tasty. Only thing that needs to be changed is that fish and chips coleslaw, not too sure what's going on there but it doesn't make any sense flavour wise."}
{"text":"Veggie burger tasted so realistic, I had to double check with the waitress if the patty was actually veg. Candy salad was okay."}
{"text":"Union social eatery . I will give it full marks food is amazing . Great customer service . General manager is on the floor checking experience , that is great for a bar on a friday esp!  FIRE CRacker appetizer is amazing that we ordered it again , just couldnt get over its creamy wonton texture . ordered  blackened chicken pasta bowtie .  GM brought complimentary chips and dips and they were freshly made in house  Just amazed and great"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night for dinner with my husband.  Food: We began with the firecrackers ($9.98) as our appetizer. I thought they were good but slightly underwhelming. There wasn't enough meat inside but the outer covering was fried and really crispy. It came with a slightly sweet sauce that complimented it well. Despite its name and description, it wasn't that spicy.   I had the almond crusted chicken strips with fries ($14.37). These were amazing! The outside was crispy yet the chicken, despite being white meat, was soft and not dry at all. The fries were thin and not too bad.   My husband had the smokehouse deluxe burger ($14.98). He said that the burger itself was slightly underseasoned and needed a bit of salt but the bacon and cheese was really good.   Service: Our server (Erika) was really nice. The appetizer came super quickly but then we ended up waiting for quite a bit for the entrees. The empty plate sat on our table without anyone taking it away and no-one really checked up on us. However, when the food came, Erika came back to ask us how it was and even refilled our pop ($2.99) without us asking.   Overall experience: Not bad at all for a chain restaurant. I enjoyed the quieter dimmer ambiance compared to other places like Jack Astors. It was easy to get a reservation on a Saturday night and we didn't have to wait at all. Plenty of parking spaces in the plaza. Would definitely come back again just for the almond crusted chicken!"}
{"text":"It's funny, but I remember the menu had quite a lot of interesting things on it, yet I had such a hard time deciding what to eat. I finally settled on the Korean tacos, which were really flavourful. I was actually going to order them again, but pushed myself to try something new.   I finally went with the firecracker appetizer, as it sounded really unique. It was ok, but I think not really something I would order again.   Service was really good. Much better than most places I've eaten at recently, so I was a happy camper. My server took the time to ask what I liked, and made some recommendations based on what I told her. She let me sample a couple of different beers, which really helped me decide what I wanted to drink.   It sure makes a huge difference in a person's entire dining experience when the service is really good."}
{"text":"Just a quick followup - someone at this restaurant must be reading Yelp, because after I made the complaints about the caesar salad in my original review, we gave it another shot just a couple days ago and the salad has done a total 180..  The portion is now actually acceptable, salad is properly dressed, and the lettuce was crisper and not warm like last time.  Glad to see these guys care and are taking customer comments into consideration  Now all they need to do is get something for the fries besides ketchup..  Guys, please start doing gravy for the fries.  You already have braised short ribs on the menu so it wouldn't be hard to do a braised short rib gravy..  The fries are great but ketchup is such a boring accompaniment for them!    Either way though this has become one of our local favorites, great job"}
{"text":"Decent spot for dinner and drinks with your girlfriends, a date or even a family.  A bit more of a bar like feel than your typical dinner-chain restaurant.  I came here with some friends after a night of bowling on a Friday night.  It wasn't too busy so it was easy for us to get a spot.  The service was really friendly, but could have been more attentive.  Everyone seemed pretty happy with their food.  Portion sizes were good.  Prices were average.  I have the nachos.  They were a good size for one person, and were VERY cheesy :)    I'd come back if in the area again."}
{"text":"This place wasn't as good as I had hoped.    While it was quite big (yet surprisingly empty at brunch), and the decor was nice and clean, the food just didn't live up to it's potential in my opinion.    I got a burger with lots of cheese.  It was bit over cooked, and didn't seem homemade.  I poutined my fries, but they came somewhat cold which was fairly disappointing.  Probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I visited the Mississauga located based on the name intriguing me and the decent reviews on Yelp.  I ordered take-out, which was more than I expected.  They included utensils, ketchup, mustard and relish which beat the normal \"you've won the lottery\" fork and napkin.    For food, I opted for the Epic burger - with reservations of course as three cheeses sounds like a little much for a burger.  To my surprise, the cheeses ended up balancing out the dried out patty.  They didn't offer me a preferred cooked temperature so it came out well done, too much for my liking.  Without the cheeses and a big dab of the ketchup that they kindly included in my take-out bag, I would have needed to dip it in a cup of water just to be able to swallow it.  The fries were great and I loved that they included a pickle slice on the side.  Overall, I would likely give them another try ... but pass on the burger."}
{"text":"Hands down, my fave American chained restuarant compared to milestones, joeys, Montana's, keg & Kelsey's.    Food was spectacular and it had an asian fusion twist!   Parmesan truffle fries: (B+) The fries were skinny and crispy, but I didn't really taste  the truffle oil. The Parmesan was sprinkled on, but it would have been better if it was melted on, but overall, I really liked the skinny fries!  Grilled swordfish burger: My friend had this dish. She really liked it and found it very flavourful!   Banana Coconut Crusted Chicken: (A+). I literally Overstuffed myself by eating the entire plate because it was sooo delicious! The chicken was so moist and tender. The sauce was sweet and favourful. Really tasted the mango and tamarind! The crust had a wonderful coconut flavour and it was crispy. Couldn't really taste the banana, but I'm sure it was there. My fave dish!   Mars bar brownie with vanilla ice cream:( B+) amazing! We got this comped because it was my bday. It was warm, moist, and sticky. Tasted amazing!   Service was great as well. Our waiter was super friendly! Definitely a cool place to do a casual bday dinner!   Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"You have the level of restaurants like Kelseys, Moxies, Jack Astors, earls etc. and you have this restaurant that is at its own level. The food on the menu is different, well thought out and exotic. I ordered the noodle bowl and it was delicious. The amount of flavor took me by surprise. The decor is lovely, nice environment and the staff is even better. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I first heard about this place through my friend who visited it not too long ago and said it was really good to try so i figured why not go ahead and try it ? Im actually going to review the two times i visited in one post so here we go...  The first time i went , it was pretty early on in the day so it was not so busy until we eventually had to leave , anyways our server was exceptional !!! I wish i had her name to give her props on her service but nonetheless everyone who was working there was pretty good with their customer service   I was indecisive at first on what to order since i had to choose between the almond chicken tenders or the chicken sandwich special they had that week which was the chicken tandoori !! I eventually opted for the chicken tenders with a side of truffle fries and boy was i happy that i made that choice !!! The chicken was so moist and tender with a crispy outside from the almonds and what made me love them even more was the fact that they were not oily at all because one of my biggest pet peeves is eating oily fried chicken !!!   The second time i went i went ahead and ordered the UFO burger with all the trimmings this too was a good choice. The patty was thick and juicy and not chewy at all !! The bun was the cherry on top , with it being soft and fluffy it did not sog up the juices of the burger which could have made it soggy  On both visits i ordered truffle fries and honestly .... it was the best thing i had there !!! My love for truffle is endless so this really topped it for me especially with the shaved parm on top !! yum !!!  What i loved most about union social eatery is the fact that there are many choices available so the place could feed many different taste buds !!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service..... Great service... Damn fine service ;) Wonderful place to stop for lunch or after work."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my partner this evening.  Our server, Jeanette was so wonderful!   She was very friendly and took great care of us.   Food was fantastic as well.  I don't think people get enough recognition when they work hard and I think this organization is lucky to have an employee such as Jeanette.   It is very rare to find service such as what we got this evening now a days.  We will return again, because of her!    Thank you for the wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Um...just no... Being gluten sensitive and from NYC, i found this place to have a great gluten sensitive menu, however, when it came to the actual food, it was not great.  I got the Roasted Vegetable Flatbread, and there were hardly any toppings on it. I think a dollar pizza in NYC looks waaaay more appealing than this flatbread. The crust was dry and hard to chew.  I also got the truffle fries which oddly, did not taste like truffle at all but tasted more like thyme.  Wasn't really expecting so much from this place but i could hardly call this place decent."}
{"text":"Free WiFi!  Environment is good.  Main floor is similar to Moxies or Joey's.  The upper level is patio with plants & wooden flooring & seats.  Food is good.  Service is superb.  Prices are average.  Food Quality is similar to Moxies and Joey's."}
{"text":"Ask for Charlie. He was great. He is the server we had on our first visit who helped us enjoy this place, and he redeemed our experience from what happened the last time. The owner was also very friendly, and made up for our last visit. I tried another stellar martini. All three that I've tried have been fabulous. My husband's steak was overcooked the first time it came out, but they took care of it promptly. Tried the creme brûlée for dessert this time, and it did not disappoint. Very crisp on the outside and creamy inside. Overall, a great dinner!"}
{"text":"I really thought i reviewed this place already since I'm basically here for any special occasion, but I guess not!  Union Social has become my girlfriends and I's birthday brunch spot.  Though the menu is limited, there are items that cater to all of our likings.  Of course though, we mainly come for the $5 mimosas lol.  Love their mimosas. I usually get the breakfast burger.  It is huge and wonderful.  Has everything you need for breakfast.  Bacon, egg, cheese, tomatoes.  The meal also comes with crispy smashed potatoes, fruit and a tiny shot of strawberry yogurt.  The meal is very filling.  Potatoes are great and flavourful. I'm not a fan of yogurt, so I can't say anything about it, as I've never tried it.     I've also tried many items off their regular menu.  The nachos, OMG, the nachos.  These are THE BEST nachos I have ever had.  Get it with the brisket chili, you'll thank me later.  The plate isn't that big, so two hungry people can finish it off easily.  Toppings are on point, cheese is on point.  They aren't pinch with anything accept maybe the salsa, but if you ask, they'll bring you more no problem.  Seriously guys, if you love nachos and haven't been here yet, GO! The crispy buffalo chicken tacos are another must try.  They used to serve you 3 tacos but have since changed it to 2 tacos.  That's fine for me because I usually can't even eat the third one lol.  Also, at $7.98, I can't complain!  The number one item that has my friends and I coming back for more is an item on the dessert menu.  The fresh baked chocolate chunk cookies with vanilla ice cream.  I can't even find the words to describe how good this is.  You know how cookies sometimes get hard when ice cream is placed on top?  This does NOT happen at Union Social.  The cookies stay warm and soft down to the last bite.  I MUST know how these cookies are made, because they are seriously to die for.    Like I mentioned, I come here for all occasions. I even had my birthday here this year.  It was Superbowl weekend and they were showing it, so I was surprised that it wasn't too packed and that the service wasn't affected.  Service here is usually fine.  I can probably remember only one time where service wasn't great, but for the most part, it's okay."}
{"text":"Dropped by during lunch, and since it was a gorgeous day outside, we asked for a seat on the rooftop patio, which had a great atmosphere. There's also two levels of seating indoors, with large TVs and a bar area.  We ordered the banana coconut crusted chicken and herbed brie double chicken, as well as truffle fries on the side. The chicken was a little dry, but the truffle fries are amazing. They are an extra $3 to substitute in, but it was definitely worth it with its unique toppings.   The service was good, and our server warned us that our meals would take 15-20 minutes to make, so keep that in mind if you're in a hurry. Overall a great place."}
{"text":"Went there a few weeks ago on a Thursday night. I called ahead to reserve a table for 2. We were seated at the table and waited and waited for a server to at least acknowledge us. Nothing happened. Both servers walked past our table several times and didn't offer any water or to even say they would be back. After waiting about 15-20 minutes we walked out and went to another near by restaurant.  This was our first time trying out this restaurant but after the lack of service we will never come back."}
{"text":"I mostly have positive things to say about this place.   Food was absolutely delicious, the portions are huge but if you want to bring it home feel free to.   We ordered the calamari to share and it was not bad. I had to control myself from eating as I was worried I was going to eat the entire thing.   Burgers, salads and pastas are all super filling. My friend had the salad with BBQ chicken on the side. She didn't finish the chicken claiming it was cold which was rather unfortunate.   There's dessert if you're still hungry or craving some sweets so not to worry.   Overall, service was fantastic. No issues at all!   FYI, if you happen to sit at the top level, washrooms are all the way down to the lowest level."}
{"text":"Such a great place to hang out with good friends and to grab a drink on a weeknight. Our server--didn't catch her name--was so sweet, really friendly, and super accommodating. Here's what I had:  Chicken with Capellini (4/5) - Really delicious! It's almost as good as milestone's Portobello Mushroom Chicken, but they opted to put in sundried tomatoes and a lot of heavy cream which made it a tad too sweet and rich for my liking.  Parmesan Truffle Fries (4.5/5) - Delicious! Due to other reviewers' comments, I asked for them to go light on the truffle oil and it turned out great. Herby and oily and cheesy and just awesome junk food.  I also had a bite here and there of all of my other friends' food and everything was delicious! Real standouts were the Korean swordfish and their steak frites. I also tried the almond crusted chicken tenders everyone was raving about and it really wasn't anything special (sorry!)... Go for something else instead!   Definitely give this place a go!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place out. places like this are great spots to go to for lunch, dinner, drinks after work and what else, social outings.  The name is Union Social Eatery, they have two other locations in the city and this one was something we decided on. the menu has lots of comfort classics and very gastropub style with lots of classics and creative twists.  ended up having the dragon roll and shrimp tacos along with the beverage of my choice. loved the atmosphere. lively, lots of wood finished and good lighting. free parking outside. service very solid as well. lots of large tables and chair spaces for getting together.   be prepared to wait for a table if you go during a busy time as it's a popular joint.  loved the variety in the menu too, lots of bar favourites in the appetizers, sandwiches, burgers, some good mains and salads. good beer and drink selection too.  will definitely come back"}
{"text":"My husband and I are flying out of Toronto Airport tomorrow morning back to the U.S.A. Since we are staying near the airport, we decided to come here for dinner based in Yelp review. I could not be more pleased.  The staff is extremely welcoming and helpful. The bar manager came over to our table and introduced herself, and welcomed us.  The restaurant and the bathrooms are really clean. The atmosphere is rustic, natural, and relaxed. A great place to wind down over a meal or a drink.  The burgers have a good sear on them and are made with completely fresh ingredients. If I lived here I would come back.  I would recommend this to anyone who is nearby and wants a good meal for a decent price."}
{"text":"Union Social Eatery is the place to be. I have had multiple visits here because it was the best place to go around my old work area. I returned to Union Social to meet up with some old friends. The food was great as usual and so was the service. What more can u ask for? The drink specials were good which stayed the same as before.   I ended up getting one of the featured menu items, which was the Killer Chicken Sandwich with some fries. I gobbled that all up as it was quite delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly and had a great combination of toppings to make it impossible not to finish. They change their food menu items at times. I would suggest ordering any of their seafood as they always have a great selection of seafood and I've never been disappointed. This place is always busy, and it's busy for a reason. I wish there was a Union Social Eatery near my work or home. Maybe one day... JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here during the holiday break and really enjoyed the service and food. We ordered their ahi tuna sliders as an appetizer, they were cooked well without the tuna being overdone and finished off with a coleslaw topping. I then ordered their spinach salad with chicken, I appreciated that they had a creamy dairy free dressing made with herbs and olive oil. My friends also ordered their burger and chicken sandwich, I nibbled off their fries which were skinny (my favourite!). We finished off our lunch with dessert, all very reasonably priced. Their cookies and cake were rich and decadent. This restaurant would be an ideal place for a friend gathering. We received wonderful service and the restaurant has a fun modern vibe to it, we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Frequently eat here. Great place to have a meeting. Felt no rush and had great service.  They accept reservations which is great because this place is always packed. With they had more tables and less booths. Ran out of fountain drinks which seems to happen often. Love the candies salad with tuna. Also baby spinach salad is great. Will be back when ever I. The area. Not something I would go out of my way for but prefer it a thousand times over pub or fast food."}
{"text":"Prices not too bad and portions are ok for the price. The food was ok. Overall I didn't see anything really special but it wasn't bad either !"}
{"text":"Tried out the North York location of Union Eatery on a Saturday night. Was just exploring the neighborhood and I'm always up to trying new eateries.  Ordered a few cocktails. They were decently priced and a good size. I had a Pimm's cocktail with 1 ounce of alcohol for just under $7 and the bf had a Caesar with 2 ounces of booze for about $9.   Food wise: apps are $7-$15 and mains are about $15-$25.   Food break down:  Korean braised short rib tacos: very good, nicely seasoned braised meat and fresh veggies. Decent taco portions (from tortilla size and veggies), but a little skimpy on that meat. Overall, it's a good taco and the soft shell was actually warm and very fluffy but not dry.   Fried Calamari: calamari anywhere off the Danforth in Greek Town is always a miss. Not the greatest dish or tzaziki sauce despite them saying it was not frozen but fresh. The batter was a little too much and too greasy for my taste.   Big Eyed tuna sliders: the piece of tuna was ok but the one thing I absolutely did not like about these sliders was how they drenched the bottom bun in a sweet teriyaki sauce. It was so overdone that the black sauce soaked through that bun and immediately made it kind of gross and soggy when it arrived at the table. I would recommend they either just have the sauce (smaller amount) on top of the first and then layer the veggies so that it won't touch the bread.   Overall good was hit and miss. Good tacos, but that's all I liked. The beer selection is good. Nice comfy interior and TVs all over so great place to drink and watch sports.   Nice big patio upstairs too. Didn't sit there so no comment. Just observation."}
{"text":"We went for our family get together and were disappointed to begin with as the table which was given to us was dirty. The chair had food all over and the waitress did not look into it. We called her to clean it and she did, but then again the other side of the chairs had juice and food spilled over. We called her again to clean it. Very disappointing. The food was horrible too. Very expensive.."}
{"text":"Tried this place for summerlicious and it was great! All three courses were amazing! The flavours of the food were rich and flacourful. It is in a good location the regular menu has decent prices, the washrooms were spacious and clean and most importantly the good was AMAZING!  I will definitely be back soon! ^^"}
{"text":"Ordered the almond crusted chicken fingers and tuna candy salad for my date. She enjoyed her salad very much and loved my chicken fingers more than I did! :P (I know you are reading this). I loved the fries too here. Shoe string and yet so tasty and not greasy.  Atmosphere was comfortable and all types of people were eating here from couples, to groups, to families. Service was on point and she was very attentive. Staff seem like they enjoy working there.   Overall, it lived up to its hype and I would come again. 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"I had high expectations of this place due to the ratings it received, but it was a horrible experience. It was more like a nightclub not a restaurant. It should not be listed under \"restaurants\" but tather a bar. The music blasting in your ear numbed my brain and it took way too long for simple food like tacos and flatbread as well as fish and chips. I was hoping that the food would ease the noise and the wait but nah... the fish and chips was way overcooked, flatbread was cold chewie and just bad, and the seafood tacos were not worth the money.  Maybe it was because we weren't drinking? This place is a bar that serves food."}
{"text":"Caitlyn is the best bartender and makes great drinks!!  I give her 10 stars! She personifies real customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Came here the other night with my girlfriend for some late night eats because we found out Origin North was closed on a Monday. She recommended us try this place because she really likes their food. So for dinner instead of ordering mains, we ordered a bunch of appetizers to share between the two of us! :)  It was more quiet so service sometimes took a little longer than we want, but overall their staff were quite friendly and also gave us some good recommendations to try!  We tried their shrimp tacos, calamari and their chicken flatbread. All three dishes were delicious and so tasty!! :) I loved the shrimp tacos, it was a bit bigger than i had expected though! but the flavours were amazing with the mayo and the lettuce/tomato/chives. the calamari was lightly breaded, definitely one of the better ones i've had in the city. flatbread was also very delicious! but i was starting to get full so in the end i packed two pieces to go, but all in all their food is pretty good! I would definitely want to come back and try more food because I saw a few items on the menu that I would like to try in the future!"}
{"text":"I've been here once and the food was okay. Nothing to complain about but nothing to rave about either !"}
{"text":"Went to watch a playoff game on a Thursday, the manager immediately accommodated our wishes when we were seated too far from the screen. She also brought over Short Rib Firecracker apps on the house for being first time visitors.   The food was incredible. We ordered Garlic Shrimp Tacos to start and the Fish & Chips for dinner. Everything was seasoned to perfection. It was so hard to choose what to order though! The menu was so diverse. Union Eatery offers things that you've always wanted at a restaurant. The prices are totally reasonable, too.   The waitress was incredibly sweet, she visited our table the perfect amount of times and never let our glasses go empty.     It's pretty loud in here, I wouldn't necessarily consider it a family place. But please check it out! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Came here for a late Saturday lunch some time ago after a family event and almost flushed it from my memory until a Yelp review reminded me.  Not bad foodwise but you can do better for the same money or just as well for less.  They were able to accommodate 9 people on fairly short notice, service was OK all things considered and restaurant & washrooms were clean enough. So if you need a place in this area and those considerations weigh on your choice you might want to keep it on your options list.   Coming in with no previous research some of us probably ordered the wrong stuff.  I had the Chicken Vindaloo which wasn't remotely Indian in flavor, it was a decent herbed Chicken with fresh if bland rice.  The Calamari with chili sauce was the best thing on the table - a little more batter-heavy than I like but tasty and not tough to chew at all. Pulled Pork Poutine was OK, I'd say fires were a touch better than Astor's.  My mom's Sirloin & Fries were also just OK. The guy who brought us here was happy with his Mushroom Burger - looked to me like something you could get for $5 less at lots of places.    As others have noted, it was quite noisy from a combination of music, loud groups and the TVs, not comfortable for conversation. And the elevated area in the back was very dark even at 2PM, I had difficulty reading the menu.  .    They gain extra points for their capacity and the long hours, but lose some points for the difficult parking in the area and overall value proposition. So 3/5 altogether.  Probably a better value & experience for those who come to watch sports & drink. Doubt I'll be repeating though"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. I've been here three times now - I've tried the Smokehouse Deluxe Burger, the Roasted Mushroom Melt Burger, and the Almond Crusted Chicken Tenders. They were all fantastic. Probably the best burgers in Mississauga, and the freshest, most juiciest chicken fingers' I've ever had. The only freezer they use here is for ice cream, so you know that everything is fresh."}
{"text":"The first time I came you could have rolled tumbleweeds through here and would have hit no one.  That was four years ago.  Visited again recently and could barely get in the door.  This place is located in a business park with large corporate buildings and is a very popular choice for lunch.  I've had their burger (freshly made), wings (delicious) and salads.  No complaints at all.  A solid choice for lunch in this area.  Very nice and relaxed atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how Union Social received such high rating on Yelp, because during my visit there I didn't have that great of an experience.   I came in for work day lunch with a large group of colleagues (about 20 of us) and we were split into 3 round tables. We were only assigned to one server among all of us so it was very difficult to get any service, and clearly the guy was overwhelmed. Good thing we didn't all arrived at the same time so the people at my table ordered first, or else it will take forever for the entire group to place everybody's ordered.   So before coming I've been warned that they take a while to serve your food, and this is mainly why my table ordered before the other showed up. Clearly we made a wise choice because it took us around 30 minutes to get our food. Usually I wouldn't complain as much for the wait time but since this was for work day lunch, and I'm sure a lot of people can't afford to stay out for lunch for a very long time. Also, we didn't all get our food at the same time for my table even though we all placed our orders together.   Onto the food. I ordered the almond crusted chicken strips, which was highly recommended by my colleague. Well it didn't turn out to be very food. The chicken strips were very dry and very bland, so you'd basically have to dip it in the sauce to make it slightly more enjoyable to eat. It was definitely not worth the waiting for, and it was slightly pricey as well.   TD;DR I definitely will not return for a second visit due to extremely slow service, bland food, and pricey items."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times and everything I've had was delicious! I highly recommend their fried calamari as a side dish. The flavouring of the batter is the best I've had. I recently came here with friend and tried their crispy chicken tacos. It was pretty great and made me so hungry that I ordered an extra one. My friend got the house salad. He is lactose intolerant and the server forgot to mention that no cheese should've been added to the salad. She apologized and compensated my friend with a larger salad instead (no cheese this time). I definitely love going here for casual eats."}
{"text":"Maybe they were having an off day. Took my mom out for a belated Mother's day lunch. Judging from the other reviews, I expected this place to be something special.  What I got was average, at best.  It's a nice place, looks great, service was attentive and friendly.  Started us off with coffee that looked like mud and had to be at least an hour old. I had the Smokehouse deluxe burger.  Not sure why they call it smokehouse, nothing smokey about it, very bland tasting. My mother ordered the killer chicken sandwich.  It was basically a mess of guacamole covering a small piece of chicken.  She had to open up the sandwich and scrape off about half of the guac.  Then it was a decent sandwich.  I'd be willing to give them another try, but would not go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to come for lunch. Not only is the food good but the staffs are amazing as well especially the GM. Will be continuing coming here for lunch on the daily."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and was very pleased. We made a reservation for a co-worker's birthday lunch and were a group of 16 people. The restaurant said that they get very busy at noon so we had to book it for a little before noon. It was perfect, because the place was getting very packed right at noon. Great selection on the menu. Service was friendly and fast. I am surprise that they did not make any mistake when they brought out the food/bill, they knew exactly who were having what which is quite impressive since we were a big party. Food was really good. I had the Margarita flat bread and it was delish! Everyone from our group also really enjoyed their food. The waiting for the bill was a little long, but understandable considering that it was their lunch rush. WIll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Good food.  Good service.   It feels less like a chain than a lot of the mid market places."}
{"text":"I work in the area so this is definitely the spot for after work dinners or office lunches. I try something different every time and never leave disappointed.   Atmosphere is lively and bustling, if a little loud at times. Everything is made in house and you can tell they take pride in what they're serving. The menu's highlight has to be the burger section. All beef burgers, cooked right, and paired with premo toppings. Their aiolis are tasty and the fries are SO GOOD! Swordfish burger with charred leeks is delicious (a little messy, but worth it), and the California (veggie burger) is outstanding with their watercress mayo.   Hands down best dining in this corporate park area."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken vindaloo which I loved. I only wish it came with more chicken(the more protein the better!). We were in a bit of rush and asked if our order will be ready quick. It only took 10 mins as they promised. In general the service and the food was great."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere is decent, but service .... what service?   Sat down and waited a good 15 mins before anyone acknowledged us. Waitress was busy serving larger party group and they were understaffed. No apologies, no manager came to show empathy.  Hit & miss Service. Beware.  Overall decent place to eat, reasonable value."}
{"text":"The service was great. I got a call reminding me about my reservation. The waitress was friendly, and personable. They asked if it was my first time, and they gave us free dips to try.   The food was OK. The mushroom burger I had, had no flavour. It was forgettable, and the fries were the same. Nothing special. One of the drinks I had was very strong, and I had to add water to even it out.   I would go back, because there are a lot of things on the menu I would like to try, and the other drink I had was very good. I'd be willing to give this place a second chance, because of the menu options, the service, and to try other drinks."}
{"text":"Thought we would try this spot for fun after seeing good reviews.    I have to say they have the best service I think I have ever had.   They didn't stop pampering us from the moment we walked into the restaurant.   We didn't have a great chance to test many main courses because we both ordered the steak special.   But the starter course we had was great, Mediterranean dip I think it was called.   They gave it to us as a welcome present,    very nice of them indeed.   Dessert was a decadent brownie which was good.   I am very curious to try some more courses here.    The service and caring is worth coming to this place for by itself."}
{"text":"Basically a modern/contemporary pub, and that's reflected in both the venue design and its menu. Serves up decent food that's reasonably priced with generous portions.  All of the servers we interacted with were excellent here and the girl at the bar was doing a terrific job despite how busy she was. As for food, I had a burger and it was one heck of a burger. It was massive and nicely topped. Overall flavour was ok and I wasn't particularly wow'd by it, but it was decent. The burger was so big that this may very well have been one of the messiest burgers I've ever eaten. Boy was it sloppy and everything refused to stay together. I was not impressed at the speed of the kitchen however, as it took quite a bit of time before our food arrived (could perhaps have just been that they were busy, but they definitely weren't at capacity).  Another nice touch: there are a good number of screens around the bar showing a variety of games, including European soccer if that's what you're into. I found it stuffy in here though, which was odd because the place is actually fairly spacious. This made my meal less enjoyable unfortunately."}
{"text":"Chose this spot to host a brunch with girlfriends. The spot is situated in Mississauga so it was a great spot for all of us to commute to easily.  The manager made me feel very comfortable and let me know that he would take care of any needs I had. I forget his name but he was very nice.   Our servers were very helpful as well, constantly checking on us and seeing if we're okay.  The place itself was nothing to write home about but it served it purpose as a bar/pub type style resto.  The food was good in my opinion. I ordered a ceaser salad with the truffle fries on the side. Salad was pretty big and I could hardly finish it. I wouldn't say it was spectacular but I wouldn't say it lacked flavour either.  Truffle fries were yum! I would definitely order them again. I really liked how our server brought over lemon water for everyone as soon as each guest showed up, that was a very attentive action on her part.  I also liked how our server never once got frustrated with us as when you have a large group and we're all socializing, we can tend to forget where we are and that someone is waiting to take our order.  The prices are really decent and I don't know what more you could ask for. My salad and fries cane to $20.. that's really cheap especially for the portion sizes.  I would say that for the group sizes that I have to accommodate that I would definitely choose this spot again!  See you soon!"}
{"text":"We've been to Union Social Eatery a few times over the past while and it's pretty good.  The positives are a good atmosphere, friendly staff and pretty good food.  We've enjoyed a variety of items including the burger, Killer Chicken sandwich, Philly Wrap, salads and edamame.    The not-so-positives include a piece of wood in an entree salad once (it was comp'ed after we reported the wood) and just this weekend, an awkward seating situation.  We're not overly picky people but it's pretty important to be comfortably and safely seated for dinner.  We made a reservation for an early dinner and upon arrival, they tried to squish us into a really tight booth (i.e. 6 people, 3 who could be described as large, into a 4 person booth) and then they tried to put us on teetering backless high bar stools.  All this when it was late afternoon/early evening and the place was not even half full.  I refused both seating attempts (and nicely explained why each time) and we were finally placed at a regular table with normal/comfortable chairs by a managerial-type guy who just happened to notice that we needed assistance.  I hate being \"that person\" and I really don't mean to appear difficult or picky but really, had they seated us at an appropriate table in the first place...  Upon leaving just after 7 pm, I noticed the far west wall of the restaurant (which has normal tables) was still EMPTY.  Yeah... a little annoying that we were having to negotiate for a regular table when we arrived almost 2 hours earlier.  Why write so much about such a little thing?  It's first impressions and basic hospitality...the feeling of being welcomed and settled at a nice table instead of feeling like we're being picky and having to negotiate.  It's important to start on the right foot.  Thanks to the managerial-type guy for saving us!  And our waitress was SUPER nice that evening too."}
{"text":"I dined in at Union Social Eatery on a Sunday afternoon and it was not packed at all.  The waitress seemed very knowledgeable about the menu and very attentive.    My friend ordered the \"House braised short rib firecrackers\" because she read on reviews that it was good, and it was \"bolded\" on the menu.  I wasn't a big fan of the short rib firecrackers because it was so saucy and the cream cheese in it tasted funky.   For my entree, I ordered the \"Killer chicken sandwich\" which is their feature chicken sandwich.  This was also \"bolded\" on the menu and the waitress recommended it so I decided to give it a shot.  The sandwich that day was brie chicken.  This tasted really good - the cheese basically melted on the chicken.  It came on an ace bakery bun with basic tomato and lettuce for the sandwich.  It came with mayo on the sandwich - I'm not a big fan or mayo so I got the sauce on the side.  The fries was really good - crispy and salty."}
{"text":"\"Still a Great Place for a Casual Drink/Meal!\"  Having been to Union Social Eatery before, I can still say that this is one of my favorite places in the Mississauga Road/401 area. Even though they are very busy, they always seem to find a way to get you in. The bar area is my favorite place to eat.  The menu is varied and I can't say I've had one bad item. The Korean Short Rib tacos are excellent as are the Calamari. The staff is friendly and humble and I hope it stays that way."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch, and while the bar wasn't busy, it wasn't quiet either. My server was friendly and attentive. I had the candy house salad, and was quite satisfied. The portions were quite large, and the salad tasted great. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant twice now.  The service has been excellent.  A small but good beer selection includes craft beers.  The menu has options for healthy or decadent.  The first time there we had the spinach salad with chicken breast.  The salad was delicious, lightly dressed and fresh.  The chicken was perfectly cooked, tender and moist.  The second time there I was celebrating so I indulged in their house smoked cheddar and bacon burger.  It was fantastic and I was pleasantly surprised that this is one of he few places with fresh cut fries that are actually crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  My girlfriend got an appetizer of dips with pita and tortilla's that she quite enjoyed.  We look forward to returning in the future.  They do take reservations on Open Table which is convenient."}
{"text":"Epic burgers for two.  Mine was adequate.  My Wife found large bone fragments in hers. She reminded me that had happened to her before here, but that was a while ago. We thought we would try again.   This time? overpriced. noisy.   quite disappointed. This location is very convenient. Oh well.  we don't plan to return."}
{"text":"A friend took me here recently after having lunch here and loving it, and I can see why! The place is beautiful (although a bit loud), the staff were really friendly, and both the drinks & food were excellent.  I ordered the chicken tenders & was really pleasantly surprised by the size of the portion. If you love chicken tenders as much as I do, and are used to getting 3 or 4 at most restaurants, then this place will surprise you. The dish comes with about 6 or 7 chicken tenders & a pile of fries (which are delicious by the way). The two sauces are also very good. Would definitely recommend.  We split dessert, which consisted of 3 warm cookies and a scoop of ice cream, and it was incredible. I'd come back here just for this dessert. I'll be thinking about those warm cookies for weeks to come (until I go back and get more). The price is very reasonable for what you get. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Summer seems to be back and their patio was great to hangout with friends. The waitress was very pleasant and polite. I tried their mushroom burger which was very good size and very tasty too. I would recommend and I will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Their kitchen is still trying to get the recipes down I think.  Rib firecrackers were tasteless inside which is a shame because the waitress raved about them, and the buffalo chicken tacos were seasoned on the overkill side and needed something to break the intensity."}
{"text":"The waitress was friendly and the food and drinks were affordable. They have drink specials for each day of the week. Overall a good experience and a cool spot that I would visit again. The place was not overly loud and had great big screen TV's."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic classy pub. The food quality is great. Sometimes the kitchen can get backed up but the staff always accommodate your requests with a smile. The sushi roll and burgers get 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to come here and wow! I really like the atmosphere this place gives off as soon as you walk in. Our server was funny and helpful and the food. The food was amazing! The tacos were a meh to me but the rest of dishes we had. Oh man the burger was amazing and the ribs oh my god. Definitely would come back anytime any day."}
{"text":"Nice spot for groups and family. The food was pretty good all except for the burgers that were charred black, dry, tough and over done. Our table had ordered 2 and they were both just edible, not tasty not juicy. We chose this spot for the gluten free menu. Service was fine."}
{"text":"When the food was a hit, it was a hit, however the misses equally stood out.  Staff: The staff were nice but our server didn't really check in with us very often so our glasses were empty quite often. The awkward moment of the night was when another guest was coming down the stairs and fell but all the servers (who were chatting off to the side) just looked over and observed as the friends of the lady went to check on her. I was quite surprised that none of the staff went to check on her.  Ambience: It was clean and what I would think of as a modern gastropub. Sports playing on the screens above the bar. The patio was also available but I didn't see it personally.  Food: I had Bahn Mi Grilled Chicken Tacos which had some heat to it, but nothing special in terms of flavour. The Fish Sandwich was mighty delicious, it was made with a sriracha mayo, and had the right amount of flavour, heat and tenderness. I opted for the Caesar salad which was a nice cooling accompaniment. The biggest disappointment had to go to the Chicken Panang Noodle Bowl. There was no flavour to the curry and the chicken was dry. I don't even think they seasoned anything at all in this dish. I was so utterly baffled how something like the Fish Sandwich could be done so right but the Noodle Bowl but done so wrong at the same restaurant.  I think a few dishes makes me want to come back (plus I like gastropubs in general) but this was far from a home run."}
{"text":"I visited this place a few years ago with my father and we both enjoyed our time there. Although this place does not have the most accessible parking (parking on the street) it is easy to get to by public transit!  The food was tasty - try any of the burgers they're delicious and those DARN FRIES were amazing!  This restaurant wasn't cheap but it also wasn't expensive (mid-range)."}
{"text":"Good value for the money and great service. This was my first time at this location, but we went because I noticed it in Yelp. Mississauga location is good too.  Tonight my daughter wanted poutine. Grated cheese, but the gravy was so yummy all was forgiven.  I went with the killer chicken sandwich, tonight was with melted Brie, and side spinach salad. Really delicious and well proportioned.  Husband had the cease and desist burger which he said was fine, maybe a bit salty.   Fireplaces a nice touch on a cold night."}
{"text":"GET THE ALMOND CRUSTED CHICKEN TENDERS!! Trust me on this, it's so fricken good. The chipotle sauce is everything. It's EVERYTHING. And the fries here are so good, and that's saying a lot because I am a serious potato critic.   For about $18 after tax and gratuity, I would say it was worth it. The meal was super filling and so much better than I thought it would be.   The staff were very friendly. I came late to a friend's birthday dinner and she attended to me right away and made sure I got my food same time as everyone else.   Restaurant atmosphere is good. The place is relatively clean, and I loved how my friend got a table on the second floor where there's only a few tables. It felt very private even though it wasn't and we weren't forgotten by staff which was good.   In summary, here's what you should try:  -almond crusted chicken tenders -fish & chips (also v good)"}
{"text":"I've actually never been to the St. Clair or Sheppard locations so this review will be solely based on my experiences at the Mississauga location.   This is one of my fav restaurant/bar chains. I come here every now and then, and I always enjoy it because the food and drinks are amazing and affordable, the vibe is comforting and clean, and the staff is always friendly. Never had a bad experience here.   I recommend the firecrackers (it's basically deep fried spring rolls with beef, mushroom, and cream cheese in them) - my friend and I are obsessed with them!!! Other things on the menu are great as well - I've never had food that is less than great here.   Love the drinks here as well! They have drink special on each day of the week which makes it easier to try the variety of their drink options. Also they occasionally have special drink menus (i.e. mojito with fresh raspberries) so that adds some fun.   This place is great if you want to relax in a casual environment."}
{"text":"Now that I work close by to Union Social Eatery I decided to give it a try after reading the raving reviews. My boyfriend and I arrived on a busy Friday evening and were glad they still had a table for us without a reservation. Make sure you make reservations if you're going with more than 2 people!  Service was friendly and quick albeit the dinner rush hour. We decided to share the Korean short rib tacos as our appetizer. He got the grilled dijon salmon and I got the chicken rose penne. We also shared a Coke but it definitely tasted like Pepsi. Our orders came out quickly and piping hot. The tacos were good and I would definitely return to try their other tacos during their special taco hours. I rarely order pasta when I go to non-Italian restaurants but I really did enjoy it. The leftover pasta still tasted great the next day.  I will definitely be returning for dinner sometime and introduce it to some of my colleagues."}
{"text":"This is a long overdue review of a place I've been a couple times so far, and that's impressed me every time, both from a service and food perspective!  The first time was for a friend's birthday on a weekday evening, and when it came time for the bill (and after finding out we were celebrating), a bunch of the staff came by to sing Happy Birthday, give a slice of cake with a sparkler, and one even gave him a hug!! A+ on first impressions.  The second time, was with a party of 14 for a Sunday lunch /brunch. Initially, we were 10, but they were accommodating for every additional person that joined our table. Everyone except one person had already received our food when the manager came by to let that person know that there was a delay with his steak, as not a big enough steak was used. When the last dish actually came, my friend had received a gigantic slab of a steak, and the manager came by to tell him that because of the delay, the meantime would be on him. A++ customer service!  Now, to the food. You must get the truffle fries as a upgraded side with your main, as it's quite tasty and for the amount you get, is totally worth it! The first time I went, I had chicken fingers (to be honest, mediocre), whereas the second time, I had a steak sandwich(?) which I remember being very savoury and definitely not lacking in moisture!  Have to say, I can't think of any reason to not continue coming back or give a 5/5 to the restaurant and their staff! Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Came for late evening drinks and appe.. we ordered House Braised Sirloin Firecrackers (creamy, tasty and good flavour balance) & Mediterranean Dip Trio (my fave is the Kalamata olive tapenade) with beer to drink.   The place is clean, good atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"I think it's crazy that I've never written a review for this place, but it just had so many already that it didn't need my help.   We all know it has great menu selection; fresh and creative. It's reasonably priced. Almond crusted chicken tenders are forever my favorite. They also do changeup the menu once and a while. My dad is very picky on things like burgers and he still claims they make the best burger for his money.  They also have a decent beer selection. Oh and the best cheesecake I've had a restaurant in years. They actually make their desserts from I know.   Service is usually pretty good. There's a few stars that shine, but I've never had a bad experience. One time our server actually brought us out some free dessert of something they were testing out in the kitchen. Can't go wrong with that.   Ambience is excellent. It's got a hip business casual vibe. But not too hip. You can take your kids, boss, or hot date. Not too many TVs feeding our ADD, nor is the music too loud. The only thing I can't stand is that silly wall with the photos of people dancing (did they originally intend to have dance nights?).    If I ever have a complaint I'll let you know :P"}
{"text":"The food was good. Had their west coast veggie burger. It was quite messy but the waitress kept me supplied with napkins. The fries were good if a bit thin."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here last night. We ordered calamari and the flatbread. Both are good but I find the calamari too oily and needs more seasoning. We had one main entree to share which was the Pan crusted Mahi Mahi with the golden dragon as a side, it was delicious. I would definitely come back here to try more dishes and recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"Good food, great patio  Had the chicken tenders with home made fries. Both had a different spin but fries were the real stars here.  Wings were flavourful if a bit small."}
{"text":"First time here and I am glad I came.  Place was packed for lunch.  Everything looked great out of the kitchen and the food tasted as good as it looked.   The price was very reasonable, though some items were a bit small for a portion.   The taco's were tiny and only 2 mini ones for $8.   The mains were all great portions and we're very reasonable.   For taste they were spot on for the dishes I ordered.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Culinary perfectionists will slum it at a place like this and find few things to scoff at.  For the rest of us, we'll be happy to make a stop here and enjoy comfort food done right.  Creaminess was a standard - every. single. dish. on the table had mayo-deliciousness or cheesy-goodness on it.  Bring your bulk-purchased lactaid when you intolerants visit this place.  Pay up for the beer (avg $8) because the place is cleeeeeeeeeean and crisp.  It's got the look of a downtown watering hole, and the class that harkens SOHO NYC beer gardens:  industrial and utilitarian.  I don't know about mississaugans, but we new yorkers are happy to drop a tenner for a drink plus tip when we sit down at a nice place.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"More up-scale Pub food. The main entree that I ordered was very delicious; however, was disappointed with the sub truffle fries and BBQ short rib poutine.  Main entree ordered (5 stars) - Banana Coconut Crusted Chicken - Great flavor with hints of banana and coconut. Would definitely get again.  The truffle fries as an add on to the main entree was very plain and flavorless. Must add vinegar. Would not recommend.   The BBQ short rib poutine was very delicious but very salty and not as much gravy as expected.  The ambiance is very nice and had the sports games on the TV's in the background.  For the food and price that is definitely not a place I would go to if I was paying. Luckily this was a business trip expense."}
{"text":"Consistent, friendly and always tasty. Ideal spot for a casual business lunch or drink after work.  They switch things up on their menu fairly regularly to keep things interesting, a couple of the favourites include Candy House Salad and the Killer Chicken Sandwich (changed daily).  Sometimes the food is not served as described on the menu, so be sure to ask your server if you are having difficulty deciding between two dishes."}
{"text":"I'd call this more like a 3.5 star. Decent burger with decent service. Nothing really bad or nothing spectacular. Think I'd go again."}
{"text":"I was here yesterday for the Men's Hockey semi between Canada and USA.  This place was PACKED! We were able to get a table since our CEO was smart by making reservation ahead of time. We arrived with 7 people but one of our chair was stolen by a neighbor table before our arrival. So one of us had to stand. Good thing it was at a high table so he didn't stand out like a sore thumb among the rest of us who are seated. Besides, the place was so packed, there were tons of people who opted to stand around.  Perhaps I came on a good day and time, the atmosphere at this place was phenomenal. I'm not sure my review of this venue will be the same if I came on a different day for a different occasion.  Although everyone else at our table was happy with their food, I wasn't too impressed. I think my fish taco was only okay. Actually, scratch that. I think this is possibly the WORST fish taco I've ever tried. The fish chunks were so DRY and didn't taste fresh. They overdid it with wasabi, so I had to tears running down my cheek. I think people thought I was emotional for our winning the USA so nobody judged or said anything.  Despite the not-so-satisfying food, I still gave this place a 4 star.  1 star goes for the price - I didn't think I can find restaurant food for less than $15 a meal at this neighborhood.  1 star goes to the pretty and sweet waitresses with award winning smiles 1 star goes to the decor, especially by a contract comparison to its neighbor competition - Scaliwag. 1 star goes to my awesome experience  I will come back again and see if anything changes. Perhaps a star will be lost if I came on a different day. Perhaps I will give an additional star if I find something on the menu that impresses me."}
{"text":"So since I was in the area again I went back to Union to check it out one more time. I have to say I am mostly more pleased than my first visit.   Kudos for them to be open late every night!   SERVICE : 5/5   Service has been consistently good. Attentive, always there when needs be, pleasant. I really didn't like the Long Island Iced tea and the waitress was nice enough to remove it from my bill.   FOOD : 4/5   Speaking of the drink; Less lemon juice and more tea please! Very week tea flavor and the bitterness of the lemon stays in your mouth for so long! The waitress agreed with me but said lots of customers like this recipe. And super please, no more glass in shape of a cowboy boot!   I instead went for a bottle of NZ Sauvignon Blanc that came perfectly chill.   For starter I had the fried calamaris (3.5/5). Good portion, slightly too much batter but otherwise enjoyable.   I tried the steak frites (4/5) once again and I was more pleased with it that time, Presentation was good, the amount of fries was generous and the cook was on point. Special mention to the aioli sauce that comes with the dish. The fries could have been fresher, they tasted a little like they were made a little while ago but were still good.   The freshly baked chocolate chips cookies and mint ice cream were decadently good (5/5). 3 cookies and a big scoop of ice cream! I finished the whole thing and have no regrets!   I think they are on a solid path to become a great neighborhood restaurant and would gladly come back."}
{"text":"Booked back nook in advance for work function (approx. 60 people) and they offered drink tickets that could be used so that only guests with drink tickets (limited 2 per person) were being paid by my company and anyone else had to pay their own bill.  The area they had is not 100% closed off so anyone could be there as they said so.  Guess what? I was there for a few hours and paid for the bill when I left (waiters counted tickets in front of me me AND I returned unused tickets directly to them).  Next work day, my boss handed me a receipt and said the restaurant/staff screwed up...  I then calculated and based what I paid and number of people I have tickets too and I was charged one extra drink on my receipt, but that was okay as it's minor (I had an attendance list I checked off for everyone I personally gave tickets to AND all tickets were in my pocket).  However, we were charged for a lot more extra drinks that my boss paid for (don't have numbers in front of me at home while writing review) so I called to complain and the Manager (so will refrain from saying his name and refer him as \"L\") was rude and blamed me by saying people came in at different times and that they couldn't possibly cash out separately!  I told this so-called arrogant Manager that this was not our agreement upon booking and that if he wasn't experienced or capable of handling our event that he shouldn't have agreed, and asked him what the purpose of his restaurant offering drink tickets if they didn't know how to use them or chose not to use them properly.  I later complained to his corporate whom seemed nice on the phone, yet and said that this behaviour did not seem like this Manager...  Also, the appetizers I pre-ordered weren't ready by the requested time and it took quite awhile even though guests arrived late.  The two designated waiters weren't nearby half the time and this started from the start so I had about 15 people standing around an empty square table staring at each other with no drinks and no snacks (including me whom arrived 1/2 hour earlier than the designated time!).  I could have let this all go if they didn't screw up on the billing and then blamed me on their own stupidity.  Do not book this place for events unless you want to pay extra and have it screwed up, and get blamed for it!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The manager is very friendly and attentive. We had a large family lunch here and all the food was perfect and the waitress did a great job making us feel comfortable. We were happy with our experience and would totally return."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have eaten here; i used to come here for lunch alot (I work and live close to the area). The food was great and the service was friendly and accommodating. The place has been renovated and the menu changed since. I decided to go back yesterday to check It out and I disappointed at how the quality of the food changed. Our order was Rib Poutine, U.F.O Burger and Fish and Chips. I was sitting next to a couple and they had the fish and chips (and upgrade to Truffle fries for regular fries) which look good so I gave it a try. (first time trying it here) BOY! Was I disappointed it came out burnt I could see how badly it was burnt under the dim lighting in the restaurant. I don't know if they have a new chef/cook but the quality of the food is not the same. Sadly or Not...i will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Service is underwhelming, inconsistent, with slow follow ups which left us with many empty glasses. For weeknight dinners, we waited way too long. Overall, we never really felt welcomed the times we've visited (upwards of 5 times).  The food is very average, nicer pub food (as a few others have mentioned). No fresh ground pepper (at least it was never available the times we have visited). Burger + fry choices are decent but greasier than they need to be. The pasta was terribly salty. The cocktails are mediocre too- nothing really stood out. The chicken tenders were just okay and the swordfish burger was not as amazing as reviews suggest. Just can't remember   The quality just hasn't been there. At least not at the times I visited. Unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Dry burgers, bland chicken fingers - bad food for all 5 of us that went. Server was unattentive, not worth a visit."}
{"text":"Union Social is my more upscale local pub. I'm consistently pleased, even surprised, with the food and service. On the surface, Union Social looks like a rustic Moxies, but it's so much more! The dining room is completely open with lots of banquet seating and high tops. The dinning room is big enough to accommodate a larger group. The killer chicken sandwich changes daily, but is ALWAYS good. I've had different versions, but if you ever hit on the day that they have a Mexican style sandwich, definitely get it! The West Coast veggie burger is also great. The watercress honey mayonnaise is well balanced and adds some nice pepperiness to the burger. The veggie patty has a good texture too. I don't know if it's made in house, but it's better than most I've tried. Every waiter that I've had at this location have been attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. It's very hard to find the consistent combo of good food and good service with a reasonable price. I never hesitate to come here, and you shouldn't either."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Union. They have a large gluten free menu with very tasty choices!"}
{"text":"Its been a long time since there was a great sit down eatery added to the Yonge/St Clair neighborhood. I didnt know this was a chain at the time - the service and food quality makes it hard to believe.  From the minute we walked in (and it was packed) they managed to make my party feel like we were the only people in the place.  Their attention to details and clear desire to ensure a fantastic dining experience ensures I will become a regular here.  On my first visit I had the mango/coconut crusted chicken breast. My description cannot do justice to this amazing dish!  The chicken was cooked perfectly and the flavours explode in your mouth (in a good way). Came with rice and veggies, but the chicken itself was the show stopper.  On my next visit I had the Chicken Quesedilla.  It was so jammed packed with filling I couldnt finish it!  Might be on the appetizer menu but it was meal sized.  They have a decent beer/drink menu and big screen TVs for after work sporting events - however at lunch they were barely noticable and didnt take away from our dining experience at all.  A far cry from Harrys Social Kitchen that was here before it.  Prices are reasonable - maybe a bit high for lunch but in line with whats on offer in the area."}
{"text":"My first time here and I will definitely be coming back! The look of the place is amazing. We had the med dip and the salmon roll, both of which we devoured. My only issue is that there weren't many cocktails to choose from. We had trouble deciding which of the few to get. But the waitress was great, and she helped us pick out drinks that we ended up really liking. She also always managed to come back at just the right time."}
{"text":"Service was amazing!  It was my first time here so they gave us a surprise complimentary chips with their own dips. The place has three levels. We sat on the patio and it was beautiful. Nice place for a date or a nice evening with a special someone"}
{"text":"Fun place, happening environment, decent food. We ordered buffalo tacos and fries for appetizer, fries were soggy but tacos were good. I tried chicken vindaloo which was not as flavorful as I expected and my beau tried steak, it was nice environment which compensated for food."}
{"text":"Every single dish I've had here has been fantastic!! Whether it's a basic dish, or something a little more daring, the cook seems to nail it every single time. I wouldn't even know what to recommend because it's all so good. My only advice, order the things that sound the most interesting...even a little odd or strange...and you will be pleasantly surprised at how delicious the combination of flavours can be."}
{"text":"Decided to come here to take advantage of the amazing weather. Sadly the rooftop patio was reserved for a large party. But the hostess was very accomodating and sat us near the open concept Windows/doors. Food was very very good, we got the turkey club sandwich and Mushroom melt burger. What really impressed me was the staff here. I wish I found out our servers name to give her a shout out here. She was very kind, knowledgeable, and seemed to really care about our experience here. I would definetly go back because of her and the manager."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many, many times. We almost always get the same things though, almond crusted fried chicken, ahi tuna and their steak. Service is always on point. The food is good for a pub. Ambiance is nice for Mississauga.  Did not try desert or cocktails."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, friendly staff, but overall the food comes up just a bit short. That being being said, the firecracker is an absolute hit. Great combination of flavors with the chili dipping sauce. The almond chicken unfortunately was barely seasoned, while the Parmesan truffle fries were very much underdone. Not a bad experience all in all"}
{"text":"I think I waited too long before my visit as I was sorta disappointed with the food.  Plus, I think the prices have gone up, quite a bit, since Union Social first opened and expanded.  Tip:  Visit a new restaurant shortly after it opens 'cause staff/food should be on-point.  Ordered:  Candied Salad ($11+$4 for BBQ Chicken), Short Rib Tacos ($8), Big Eye Tuna Sliders ($14), & a Pims & Ginger.    Our table got the Mediterranean Dip ($7.99) for free as I told the waitress this was our first visit.  From the dips, the Sundried Tomato w/ Feta was the best, the others were just ok, including Hummus that tasted like one from Costco - not entirely a bad thing, but definitely not a freshly dip.  Black Olive tapenade was very salty and tasted like...black olives.  Dip came with some tri-coloured nachos and triangle slices of naan.  Knowing what I get for that price, I would never personally order this.  I never tried the Candied Salad, but apparently it was ok.  +$4 was literally for 5-6 slivers of chicken.   Short Rib Tacos ($8) - Barely any \"short ribs\" which was more like 2-3 slices of bulgogi meat.  This dish did have a kick from the chipotle mayo.  This Starter only came with 2 tacos.  More slaw than meat.  Big Eye Tuna Sliders ($14) - The proportions were totally off on this one, bun was quite thick, soo much slaw, and a menial serving of tuna.  Carb central.  Dudes, I know fish is expensive, but it was literally buried with this plating.  Honestly, I think it would've worked better as tacos, slightly smaller than Short Rib tortilla would've been ok, with longer pieces of fish.  No flavour on the fish which was a shame.  Slaw had a hint - just a small hint - of some kinda wasabi cream dressing.  Pims ($7) - Initially, I thought it was a \"good price\", especially in comparison to downtown counterparts, but honestly, it was WEAK.  I couldn't even taste any alcohol in it.  It tasted like a berry ice tea.  I brought my mom and she was not impressed.  She doesn't like dining at \"White restaurants\" 'cause she feels as though it's terrible value.  And I'm afraid that Union Social was a good example of this small portion/higher prices thing.  Mains were ~$15.  Too bad about the bad value because the waitress/staff were super nice!  Maybe a bit too over attentive, but very Stepford-nice.  Honestly though, I wouldn't really go out of my way to visit a place with nice service, but just mediocre food.  Again, too bad I didn't visit Union Social before it became a victim of its own success!"}
{"text":"Today, we concluded our holidays on a good note by having lunch at this restaurant. This was our first visit and I found no negative points for this place. From the outside, the setup looks interesting as you can't see through the window who or what is inside the restaurant but once inside, you can see all activity that occurs outside. The inside is very modern and trendy and you feel like you have teleported to a busy urban city like Toronto. It is a casual style cafe and the furniture and attire of the staff are the ones that set the environment. Washrooms are clean, spacious, and fancy.  The menu is only a page long, just like Turtle Jack's, except the selection here is better quality for the price you pay. All items ordered are prepared in-house and are fresh. They even have some gluten-free options for anybody who is health conscious. We were given a firecracker ribs appetizer on the house, which tasted like a delicious crispy wonton. However, I would have already given this eatery a 5-star rating even without this surprise bonus. Also, don't get disappointed if you don't receive a complimentary item when you visit because I have a feeling that this free appetizer was just a one-day promotion since it was just recently added to their menu and we just got lucky to be there when this was happening. We also ordered the Mediterranean Dip Trio (olive dip, sundried tomato, hummus) appetizer, which came with Naan bread and nacho chips. All were delicious but personally, my favorite was the olive dip and Naan combination. I ordered their fish and chips for my main course and it was the best fish and chips I've ever had in comparison with ones that I had at other restaurants. When tasting, you could tell that the fish was made with fresh batter and their fries were tiny-sized and crispy and it came with coleslaw salad and a nice-tasting green sauce, which tasted way better than your typical tarter sauce. Their portions were just right, not too little, and not too large and overwhelming. I took the remainder of my fish and chips to go and can't wait to eat it again tomorrow.   Their pricing is appropriate for their setting and is on par with other popular chain restaurants like Boston Pizza or Montana's except here, you get specialty gourmet food, which is a pretty sweet deal. Service was consistently friendly and efficient all throughout. Our server even made small talk with us at the end, asking us what our plans were for the remainder of the day, which I thought was awesome. You could tell that the staff love what they do and take pride in their business.   I definitely want to come back in the future and would highly recommend this restaurant for our family and friends."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the food at all. Tacos came out cold. Our server was super friendly and the ambiance of the place was cool."}
{"text":"Typical bar atmosphere. Came here on a Saturday night and it was full. Food was above average, great unique selection. We ordered all apps, everything was delicious. The quantities were surprisingly big for $8-10 apps. Really great customer service. We even got a free app (the Mediterranean trio dip) because it was our first time!"}
{"text":"Lovely  The food: I ordered the banana mango chicken and it was perfect. The mango sauce was delicious and tasted great with the jasmine rice. They texture of the crusted chicken worked well with the rice. I wish I had taken pictures before eating because the food was BEAUTIFUL.  The ambiance: very casual and \"social\". They have a bar and some high tables along with booths. This seems like a great place to bring your friends to. I came on Christmas Eve and they had very festive decor.   The service: exceptional. My waitress was so ecstatic in the way she described the food. The staff are very attentive and lively.   Drawbacks: The \"social\" environment can be a bit loud. This is not the place to have a serious discussion in. Also, the food took quite a while to come out. However, I did not mind since the food was great.   Overall: DEFINITELY WOULD COME AGAIN   P.S. They have really good wifi 10/10"}
{"text":"I don't usually go to Sauga for food, but this place has always been my go to whenever I'm in the area. It's a safe bet, and you can't go wrong with it. That being said, food was never disappointing..but it's also not amazing. It's your average American restaurant food.  I have had their Fish and Chips, and Chicken Bowties. Both were pleasant but nothing that makes me want to come back for more. I see a lot of great reviews here on their burgers; unfortunately I'm not a huge fan of burgers.  Service is on the slower side but the waitresses here are always so friendly and welcoming. It's a great spot for a \"conversation meal\"."}
{"text":"Great spot for a business lunch or dinner with friends. I recently had lunch here with my mom and sister - everything was delicious and service was spot on. A reco - make a reservation for Friday lunch - it's busy in there! The short rib tacos were amazing!"}
{"text":"I had great service on my trip here. The waitress was attentive and full of suggestions.  The food was above average. I had the ginger mojito (it's called something else on the menu) and it was the best mojito I've had. Lots of mint and just the right amount of ginger beer! The mango BBQ wings were perfectly crispy.. Best texture! The BBQ sauce was lovely but I wish there was a bit more on the wings. The actual wings didn't have much flavour and didn't really taste smoked.  My main was the cheese burger and I upgraded to the truffle fries, which was a $3 upgrade. I was told the other upgrades were any of the four salads. The truffle fries were amazing - very thinly sliced and perfectly seasoned. Super crispy! Amazing. The burger burned my mouth it was so hot. In fact, all the food was steaming! It was juicy and flavorful and had a great bun. It isn't the best burger I have ever had, but it would definitely give me my burger fix any time. You get ketchup, mustard, and relish on the side and the burger itself is served open faced with tomato, onion, and generous amounts of crisp lettuce.   The only slight downside was that they were out of calamari! The burger and wings were great, but not out of this world good. The fries and mojito were top of their class, though. So it's a close call between a 4 and 5 star review! If the service is as consistently good as my experience was, then the 5 star is deserved."}
{"text":"I had lunch today with colleagues at Union Social Eatery.  I ordered Chicken Vindaloo.  It was okay.  The sauce had a nice bite.  The chicken was cold, though, which surprised me.  I wouldn't get it again.  Brent had a salad with rare seared bigeye ahi tuna.  He said it was good and he'd get it again.  Antonia got Steam Whistle Fish & Chips.  It looked good and there were a ton of fries.  I may get that if I go back.  Bri got the Ace High Club sandwich.  She said it was good and she also got a ton of fries.   I may get that if I go back.  Kyle was our server.  He was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Such awesome service!  We were a party of 3 adults and 3 kids (6,3,1.5) and the waitstaff and management were simply amazing!!  Super attentive and the food was great!"}
{"text":"Great music and great food. Small restaurant but we had great company event for about 30 of us. It was perfect place for finger foods and drinks."}
{"text":"Found this place using Yelp and was happy I did.  Nice clean casual atmosphere.  Grea service wonderful pleasant staff.  Food was very good and affordable.  On my return list when in tje area."}
{"text":"We went to the Union Social Eatery for Sunday dinner. The restaurant is nicely decorated and the service was very friendly. It is more a bar than a restaurant. Everything is made in house so the food should be great.  We started with the pulled pork poutine. It was pretty good. I was not very hungry so I had a Caesar salad. It was a typical Caesar salad. My friend had the Brie Chicken. She was happy with it, but it was nothing special.  Would we go back? Probably since the staff was very friendly and I would like to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Been here twice in the past year, both great experiences. Most recent one was for a friend's bday. When I called to make the reservation, I was pleasantly surprised at how attentive the staff were. In addition to asking me the time, date, number of people, they asked if we were celebrating anything, how old the person was turning, if we were going to bring a cake, and if we needed candles! It was nice to feel like they actually cared. I was again pleasantly surprised when a staff called me the day of to confirm the reservation, offering to bring out a dessert with a candle if we didn't have our own cake. Once we were there, service was pretty speedy, and food was delicious. It was a super busy Saturday night, but our server never got flustered or forgot about us. There was a minor error on my bill at the end, but the server apologized and fixed it right away, no issues. She wasn't snippy or anything. Would definitely come back here for a group get together or celebration. It definitely beats any of the regular average restaurants around in terms of quality of food and service!"}
{"text":"Been there for a dinner with friends. The place is huge, lots of space, and a large parking lot in front. Good for groups of long-time-no-contact buddies finally meeting each other.  Food was pretty good, actually not bad at all - not a \"chef's magic\" stuff, but honestly good, and the portions were hefty.  Lots of drinks (again, nice for friends' reunion party), cozy booths, not too loud.  Service was on a slackish side, though - with barely quarter of the place filled, we were waiting for what seemed like forever, and that's not good.  Otherwise, ok to go for some drinkin' and chattin' with groups of friends - and maybe not so good for the couples who wish to keep things intimate."}
{"text":"Their is a bit of a disconnect from the moment you arrive in the parking lot as the signage makes a cool, sophisticated impression that does not match the semi-bland interior. This could be any of the relatively higher chain restos that feels like it needs an update but maybe that's just me?  The food is the thing in any restaurant and pretty much everything was just ok. Our salesman/server;) confidently stated the steak tacos were the best menu item, and they were, but still only rated a just above average 3.5.  I had a ribeye with mashed and seasonal vegetables that was not coked to medium as requested (who knows why they ask in spots like this because it is pretty much never done right?). The accompanying sauce was actually very good and that saved this dish for me.  If Union Social was located closer to where we live it might merit another chance but we live in the south end of Mississauga and thus will be sticking closer to home."}
{"text":"Moving back to the city a couple of months ago, after a many year absence. It took me sometime to get past my old haunts and begin my branching out to try new places. Passing this restaurant several times now, it was bookmarked mentally. Today I popped in mid afternoon, with only 5 people there I wasn't sure if that was a good or bad sign.  The hostess and server's were all very friendly and blond lol  Beautiful ladies doesn't hurt a thing :D    I looked over the menu and decided to ask about the \"Killer Chicken\" Sandwich. Today's special there was chicken sausage, cheese, greens, onions and chipolte mayo, sounded amazing and the best addition was definitely the \"Sushi Dragon Roll\" and being able to add it instead of the usual fries was cool. I have never seen that before. Appetizers added instead of fries....this jaded former New Yorker was impressed.  The food was as killer as the name suggests, I was in love with the tastes. Two polar opposite dishes on the same plate and the were married perfectly. Moving past my food, I got dessert afterward. Vanilla ice cream and cookies with a sort of oatmeal/caramel glaze ?   Sweet JC, this food.    I have added this place to my new top 10 of Toronto list  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Everywhere that's good for groups is good enough for me.   Came here with a group of 7 and our reservations where available even being a few min late (which was great might I add)  Anyways, since we were celebrating a birthday, they were more than happy to hold our cake in the back until later. Major bonus.   Their food is pretty good. We had nachos and calamari as a starter and couldn't complain. Everyone enjoyed them selves.   I also ordered the shrimp taco which was my biggest mistake. I'm not to sure what kind of seasonings they use mixed together but mine ended up being wayyyy to salty. I told the waiter and she was more than happy to have them removed from my bill and apologized multiple times. I didn't mind.  She came back 10 minutes later and told me they made me a new batch of shrimp tacos. They were still salty...   Soooo I'll assume it's the seasoning mix they use on the shrimps. I didn't make a fuss about it though. Not my style. I just asked for a go container and left.    Honestly, other than my salty tacos, this place is quite lovely. Most def a return. I just won't order the same stuff."}
{"text":"Short rib Gorgonzola long board flatbread.  Wow. I have dreams about it. This place is a gem. Nice downtown feel in the burbs. Great for watching the game but more of a restaurant then a bar."}
{"text":"**4.5 stars**  This place was buzzing with people on a Wednesday evening at 7:30 pm. I was pleasantly surprised by the hip vibe and cool buzz of people in here - I definitely didn't feel like I was in a strip mall in Mississauga.  Our server got us off to a good start - the service is very worth mentioning here. She was passionate about the food and raved about everything we ordered. I would be happy and proud to work here too if my restaurant had such incredible food!  On Wednesdays they have a $5 craft beer special so we opted for that but next time will take advantage of the VERY affordable bottles of wine ~$26-$40!  What's most impressive about this place is their food. The menu is exciting - lots of fresh ingredients and creative flavours. Parmesan Truffle Fries, Korean Short Rib Tacos, Almond crusted chicken tenders and Bay of Fundy Salmon salad to name a few. Glancing at all these options, I was already planning my next visit here. Good thing I work close by!"}
{"text":"I was in Mississauga on a business trip last week and stopped by the Eatery for dinner.  The steak frites, Mars bar brownie, and speed and friendliness of the staff were all outstanding.  I definitely plan to return to the restaurant during my next trip."}
{"text":"Amazing service and the quality of food is fantastic as well. I ventured here with my boyfriend at 10:30pm after a stressful endeavor dealing with Air Canada at the airport...  We were greeted warmly and were laughing with the hostess about the shenanigans that brought us in. Highly recommend both the nachitos (with chicken) and the shrimp tacos!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, and a large selection of drinks. Prices definitely do have a premium.   My server, Chris, was on the ball. I decided to get a burger and a sweet Apple cider. Not from the area, I was unfamiliar with the brands offered here, and so Chris explained the differences and made recommendations.   I had a great experience here and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Went to have a drink before dinner.   The place looks pretty nice from the outside but it was basically another cheesy Moxies when go inside. Definitely not my scene.   However, the martinis were $5 and were made exactly like how we had asked  so that was nice.   we just downed them and left after 15 minutes.  Would come back for the specials but never to stay for more than a drink."}
{"text":"Good place for snack food/drinks before a night out or casual outting with colleagues after work. Korean short rib tacos and BBQ short rib poutine are both are good options."}
{"text":"I dine here regularly as I work in the area. Overall I am satisfied, but wish more vegetarian options were available. Cooking basic staples like rice in chicken broth just makes no sense in today's day and age. Please switch to vegetable broth, it would open up so many more options for customers that avoid animal products. The veggie burger is great, but not as the only option every single time.."}
{"text":"Came for brunch. Found the prices high for what was offered.  They charged me $15 for eggs and potatoes. The potatoes were delicious but scanty portions (I got 3 and a half baby potatoes with my order). The service was also slow. It took 30 minutes just to take our order and then another 30 minutes to bring our food. This whole time, they didn't come by once to refill coffee. Definately not coming back to this place."}
{"text":"On my first visit, I met with friends for drinks and we ordered a selection of items from the menu to share. The food was excellent. Having been so memorable, I raved about the place, mainly atmosphere, service, portions and affordability to family members. On the next family outing, I suggested Union Social. What a mistake!  The time frame between visits 1 and 2 were two weeks apart. Let me stress how huge of a disappointment visit 2 was in comparison to the first and why.  First time going, two friends and I shared the following: shrimp tacos, vegetable flatbread, almond crusted chicken and chicken bowties. Between three people, the food was more than sufficient. We ate a lot with plenty of leftovers. It was also juicy and flavourful. The flatbread especially was huge! A suitable sized sharable appetizer. Or so you'd think..  Seeing as it was so delicious, I kept making mention of it and insisted we order that as a shareable app on my family outing.. I kid you not, when the flatbread came, it was a fraction of the size of the one I shared with friends! I was actually shocked and said to our server this is a joke!  Everything about that flatbread had shrunk. From the dough to the crusts thickness, amount of toppings.. everything! It was tiny!  My two family members each ordered a main of steam whistle fish and chips. I ordered the bowties (had a craving) and the chicken tenders (for the table to share).  Basically, the feedback I received from family was, the food was mediocre. And truthfully, they are right. Even the chicken tenders had shrunk and were drier than I remembered them to be. The pasta stayed the same. It was certainly delicious enough for me to return for more. The downside is, it's not a place I'd recommend again.  Good for drinks. Restaurant is loud and dimly lit on Fridays and weekends. Service is pretty decent and quick. The fact that the menu changed up in a matter of weeks is pathetic. Make reservations ahead of time.  Overall, 3.7/5. And that's me being generous."}
{"text":"Great meal and great service. Definitely try the candy salad. It is a good size portion, incredibly tasty and you can get different protein on there whether it is salmon, chicken or shrimp.   Other favourable mention goes to the burger where you can also get the candy salad on the side! One of the better burgers in the area.  The flatbread is pretty good too. Better than others I have had at bier market.  We had the veggie one.   Glass of wine is around 8 bucks and the salads are around 15 to 16 bucks. Good atmosphere but busy at lunch time during the week. We went at 1pm which was great as it was dying down and completely dead by 3pm."}
{"text":"My Tri group and I came here for a celebratory dinner after our triathlon a few weeks ago. The staff were great about our boisterous-ness (we were excited!) and our waitress was great!   They have a separate gluten free menu, which was awesome! I have never seen gluten free flatbread on a menu. I nearly died. It was awesome! I even took the leftovers home and used them with my own dip. I ordered a pasta dish. Can't remember the name but it was cheesy penne with veggies in it. Super delicious and reheated well! My stomach didn't thank me for the dairy, but it was worth it!  My friends ordered the truffle fries as a starter and something with rocket in the name - they thoroughly enjoyed those as well!  The ambiance, the food and the service is great. I think I'll definitely return. There were many more items on that gfree menu that need to be tried!"}
{"text":"So I'm going to be fair and say that I came here for alcohol and that's about it.  So my review will be based on service and drinks.  I came here for my birthday, I just had dinner with my family and I came down with my husband as we were staying around the area.  I feel like a bit of a jerk because I didn't get the gentlemen shame that served me but he was AMAZING.  They ran out of the whiskey for one of their drinks and he went to the bar to get the name of every single whiskey they had so I could substitute it.  Makers mark baby!   Anyways the drinks were great all of them!  And I had a lot from the menu :p. My waiter found out it was my birthday and insisted on bringing me a cake, I told him it was ok, that I wasn't in the mood for a cake.  He brought me out a cookie!!!!! Haha I thought that was amazing!    Would come back 100%!!!"}
{"text":"The food is great, the service is great, the atmosphere is great too! Overall I recommend this place!! I'd post a picture of my food but I inhaled it since it was so good but take my word for it when I say it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! Most of the time I wouldn't be too concerned with the staff and would be more focused on the food, however the service here was outstanding. Two managers and one waitress visited our table with a complementary dish and welcomed us. I really liked their truffle fries and the burger was alright. The tacos, in my opinion were pretty average which is why I took one star off. They were over stuffed with toppings and protein. I was also expecting more of a pan fried shrimp. However, overall the service was great and is the reason I will most likely return!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good healthy food options.  recommend for family dinner, date night, and girls night."}
{"text":"Killer chicken sandwiches are generally a great bet. Service is pretty good, even during busy hours. For a chain type resturant I. Suburbia, it's prob one of the best."}
{"text":"Yum. Fresh food prepared well. Enthusiastic staff. Nice atmosphere. Other than the enormous photos of people dancing on the wall?"}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times, and it always have the most stellar service and food! I have always been impressed by each server, and each time I am there, there is always something that they do to stand out. I have never been disappointed, and am very impressed with the overall value you get for the price. Great apps, and nice size plates always leave me with leftovers to savor when I get home. I especially love the club sandwich - it comes with turkey, bacon and all the usual's on an amazing cranberry focaccia bread that basically tastes like thanksgiving in your mouth!  All around a great, reliable place to come back to again and again."}
{"text":"Great service and wonderful food.  We stayed an extra hour drinking and chatting with the employees.  Get the fancy poutine..."}
{"text":"Right outside of St.Clair station this gem of a pub is a great after work dinner spot for those who live in the area.   Started off with the house braised short rib firecrackers -- amazing!!!!! Deep fried with spring roll sauce to dip, this app was definitely 5/5 for $9.25; comes with 4 pieces (sorry no photo).  Also had the Korean short rib tacos, 3 small tacos and they were not bad. I'd wish for a bit more sauce and quantity on the taco, but overall not bad.   The smokehouse deluxe burger was delicious. Juicy and with all the right toppings. Definitely a huge burger to eat. Better yet, it comes with shoestring fries. Those type of fries should be eater by the handful. Perfect combo.  Overall meal cost $45. Great atmosphere. Pub is nice and relaxing with TV to watch at the bar. Staff is on point!"}
{"text":"Brunch on a Saturday. I had high hopes but unfortunately it wasn't a home run. I got the breakfast burger $13 and it was average. My friends got the eggs beni with salmon $15 and they weren't terribly impressed. Apparently the egg is very Salty and the muffin was tough to cut. However one friend thought the french toast was amazing $13 -- so I would suggest that!   Food took about 30 min to be served, kind of long when there was only two other tables. Pretty deserted so it was a kind of slow day. Our waitress was friendly and approachable. The atmosphere is casual and chill. Overall it was okay, but I probably won't be coming back for brunch. I'll check out dinner though one day!"}
{"text":"3.5 I'd say!   Had dinner here tonight and enjoyed my meal! The restaurant is really cool inside, looks like it once was a garage converted restaurant with an industrial-meets-urban look to it. I'd consider the food to be pub food with some elevated items. Price point is decent, a bit high for a regular weekday meal i'd say, however.   I tried their feature fish sandwich which appears to change daily. Today was a grilled Arctic char with a soy or sesame glaze, topped with some coleslaw in a soft burger bun. I enjoyed the sandwich, the flavour was good and the mountain of fries they give you are great, too much for one person though. I wonder if anyone ever finishes those fries! I also shared the calamari and that was decent as well. I enjoyed the Thai chili sauce that came with it. I also tried the chicken strips which were a bit more upscale with the almond breading. These were not bad, however not outstanding in my opinion. I felt as thought every dish was maybe missing or lacking something, nothing was extraordinary to me, unfortunately. I would maybe like to try the Penang curry bowl next time, I saw a few people with that and it looked great.   The service was decent, a bit slow at times which was a bit strange for a Tuesday evening and it wasn't even that busy. Our food took quite a while to come but we weren't in a rush so it was ok. We had upgraded our fries to the truffle fries and that was missing once we got our meal, we let a server know and this was fixed immediately which was good.   The restaurant is a nice big space. Lots of tables and on a nice day, the 'garage' doors were open so a nice breeze was coming in. The restaurant is warmly decorated with lots of dark wood furnishings and retro light fixtures.   I would maybe come again with some friends if they wanted to go but probably wouldn't be rushing out to eat here next time I'm hungry!"}
{"text":"Everytime I passed by, I always see it filled with people. I had to try it for myself! The first experience was enjoyable and due to the limited options around this area, it made me come back for lunch the next day!  Day 1: I ordered \"The Cease & Desist Burger\" and replaced my fries with the dragon roll. The presentation was absolutely gorgeous! The burger was a solid 4/5 stars - very juicy and the U.S.E special sauce with the braised ribs was a nice touch, but nothing amazing (tasted like bbq pulled pork). I would give the sushi a 2/5 stars - very disappointing and I highly recommend not paying the additional cost for it.  Day 2: From reading the reviews on yelp, I had to try the swordfish sandwich for myself. Similar to my day 1 experience, it was good but nothing amazing. A very flavourful sandwich and a solid 4/5 stars. I had replaced my fries with a poutine (don't judge), but similar to the sushi, I was disappointed once again. I would give the poutine 3/5 stars. The lesson here is to not replace your side with anything!  Overall, the atmosphere of the place is quite nice but a bit loud. One of the better places to go if you are in this area!"}
{"text":"They treat their wait staff like crap, and underpaid.  I'm not supporting exploitation no matter how good the food."}
{"text":"Terrible service, went for lunch and our waitress sat at the bar and texted on her phone and completely ignored us and never was offered a refill, waited 30 minutes for the bill after we finished eating and they came back with the wrong bill, didn't feel welcoming and I would not go back. The food was okay."}
{"text":"Always the first choice when going out for drinks. Drinks menu is good with interesting choice of names. Recommend the truffle fries, nachos and wings for appetizers. Worth trying."}
{"text":"Hubby & I ate here when we were in the area. The service was really good & the manager actually came over to chat for a bit because he used to be the manager for the North York location. He was really nice. The food was good too! I had the mushroom burger. Decor is nice. Lots of dark woods. The space isn't that large but it was pretty busy. There was no music playing so it wasn't loud at all. We'd come here again to eat if we're in the neighbourhood. ."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner after watching a musical downtown. I got the salmon with veggies.Hubby had the fish and chips, same as my dad. My mom had the chicken vindaloo. Every time we've had food here its always been delicious and wait staff have always been great. This time was no exception. Food was delicious! My salmon was a good size and cooked perfectly. The veggies were also good and the rice was okay. There was actually too much rice for me to finish. I tried some of hubby's french fries and they were good as usual.   The restaurant was fairly busy. Even the upper floor has people sitting there. But our food came out at a reasonable time. The manager even came by to see how everything was and she was really nice. Our waitress was very nice. I liked seeing the way the staff at this restaurant interact. At one point I saw the chef come out of the kitchen to take a break and chat with the manager a little. Then a former employee came by to visit and all the servers came over to hug him and chat with him. The employees here seem to genuinely like each other and work well together.  There wasn't anything I can think of that went wrong with our meals or service.That's why I keep coming back here. The place cane be a little slow during the day but it was really hopping when we came on a Saturday night.    Just a side note, the washrooms are downstairs. I'm not sure if they have a handicap washroom on the ground level for those who are mobility challenged. Though my dad walks with a cane he was able to get to the washrooms without too much trouble."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had an incredible experience at Union Social Eatery. The food tasted great (I had the rose chicken penne and he had the steak frites. Shared the Mediterranean dip trio too), but best of all was the service! Everyone was friendly, attentive and genuinely cared about providing a great experience. Our server delivered our items quickly and the manager came over to make sure we were enjoying our meal...which we absolutely did!  Next time, we'll definitely save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Went there for a friend's birthday party, everything was a perfect \"A-OK\" -  the service, the food, the drinks and even a drunk guy who tried to talk to us for 10 min when we went outside for a smoke..."}
{"text":"We were there Saturday night for dinner.  Service was very slow and food was ok. Seems like quality declining ."}
{"text":"This restaurant (particularly, Esther) was excellent in helping me organize my boyfriends' surprise 30th birthday bash. It was a great turn out based on the service we all received.   Service:  Servers were very attentive and organized. There were about 3 waitresses taking our orders. We were a medium sized group of about 20 people. And none of us had to wait long for our food or drink.  Food:  Excellent for a casual resto/bar. There is a great assortment of items to choose from, including gluten free options. I recommend the parmesan truffle fries, roasted mushroom melt burger, and almond crusted chicken tenders. Everything on the menu is under $20!   Atmosphere: We had a long table set up in the back, it made our gathering more private. There was enough room for all of us to walk around to chat with one another. The ambience is great with a good balance of volume of music and lighting.   The restaurant was very accommodating and made every effort to honour my requests (ie. decor, cake cutting, set up) which definitely made me happy and made my surprise party a success.   I highly recommend this place for any occasion!!"}
{"text":"Patio - unique patio with plenty of semi-private seating areas. Perfect for a rooftop patio summer day. Tho I find that Jack Astor's rooftop patio is way better than this one. But if you're here for the food, it's better than jacks!   Food- truffle fries are a favourite. The special chicken sandwich with avocado is also a healthy choice. Pretty juicy and bread not dry. Also ordered the flatbread and it was good enough to share! Lettuce could have been a bit more fresh but overall the taste was fair. A bit saucy, but a good starter or meal.   Drinks- Kronenburg blanc on tap. That's all I could say. Amazing! Not a lot of places have kronenburg blanc on tap (rather just in a bottle). Order it!"}
{"text":"A bit overdue, but I had to update my review.  First of all, I'm assuming management has been reading many of the reviews that were left in recent months. Many of the issues that many yelpers including myself had experienced were being addressed and the effort was evident. They had updated menus, friendlier service, and the fries seemed like they were prepared to order rather than served cold.  Here is my verdict upon my recent experiences:  Food: 3.5/5 They have vastly improved the food quality since they went downhill. It is still nowhere near what it used to be, but it is a huge improvement and i can see that they are paying more attention to what is actually being served.  Ambience: 4/5 One of the reasons why i keep going back is the laid back vibe that Union has. It just has this feel to it that just makes you want to grab a few of your close friends and kick back and relax with the beer of your choice.   Service: 5/5 Funny thing is, in recent visits, I've been served by the exact same waitress who served me when i had some piss poor experiences there. In my negative review, i had mentioned the lack of attention and care that was shown by the waitress. I would like to withdraw those comments and say that she was probably just not having the best night of her life. She is human afterall, and nobody provides excellent service consistently on the daily. In recent visits, she was amazing and made the experience for my friends and I truly spectacular. It's clear that she stepped her game up a few notches and i swear, we were checked up on probably a minimum of 12 times on our night there. Not once did we feel ignored and not having to flag down your server is always a plus.  I'm pretty sure that the manager (and probably the waitress) recognized me and associated me with this review because they went above and beyond to compensate me for my previously bad experiences. I won't mention in detail what they did for me but let's just say that it was a very cheap night out for our group.  In conclusion, i give Union Social another 4 stars.  Props to the management team and our server (i wish i could remember her name) for their efforts!"}
{"text":"This is definitely an improvement over Harry's Social Kitchen.  I liked the Korean Short Rib Soft Tacos, Thai Red Curry and the House Smoked Mosquite Wings.  They have a fair selection of beers on tap and the wine is reasonable.  They also have big screen TV sports.  Good addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Decided to meet a friend for dinner here. Atmosphere is good, the restaurant is clean and updated. My friend ordered a burger, and I ordered the turkey club. My friend said it was the juiciest burger he'd ever had - great! My turkey club on the other hand, very disappointing. I was surprised to see that they had used processed meat on the sandwich! It wasn't awful, but had I known, I wouldn't have ordered it. Service was sub-par. After receiving our food, the server stopped by once, then wasn't to be seen again until we needed our bill. We ran out of napkins mid-meal, so this was a bit frustrating. Overall, not a bad experience, but not great. I don't think I'd return."}
{"text":"Such a nice addition to the area. The atmosphere is very relaxed, friendly and personable staff, fairly priced drinks & tasty food. The epic cheese burger is absolutely amazing - a must try"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night on my last night of my placement to celebrate with my co-workers.  I reserved the table the day before and their manager called me the next day to confirm.  She told me they were booked out that day and confirmed then re-confirmed I will be there.    At 5:30 I came in and was surprised we weren't sitting on their patio - oh well, my fault for not specifying (stupid me).  The waitress got acquainted with my party and took everybody's drink orders.  Service was actually fairly good throughout the meal as there was maybe 3 or 4 other parties inside the restaurant.  However, towards the end we could nooooot for the life of us find our server to get our bills.  She did make up for it by coming through with 2 machines so we were able to gtfo :)  The restaurant itself is very nice.  Very classy with a huge bar in the middle and tables scattered around it.  After we told our waitress it was our first time at the restaurant and she brought out a plate of complimentary nachos for our table!  This is literally a first as all other restaurants guard their food like it's Fort Knox ... haven't gotten a complimentary anything in ages (yes I'm looking at the 'classy' a la carte sushi restaurants that don't give out salad/soup).  I ordered the Chicken Panang Noodle Bowl.  Which was pretty much a disappointment.  I thought it would be a little spicy and creamy.  However, a bunch of the noodles just stuck together and it tasted rather bland with pieces of chicken stuck to it.  My boyfriend's burger was delicious though.   Overall, this place definitely deserves 4 stars for efforts."}
{"text":"We arrived here for a late dinner tonight at 8:00pm, and the place was hopping. This establishment has a very modern look with wooden walls and tall ceilings. There's a dining room to the left, and bar area to the right, all very open.   Our server, Trixie, was absolutely fantastic, asking us if this was our first visit (it was) and telling us a bit about the place.   The menu isn't that big but had lots of interesting choices. We ordered the buffalo chicken taco appetizer and bacon cheddar burger. While we waited they brought over a complimentary deep fried wonton which was hot and very tasty. It came with a fire sauce which added a nice kick to it.   The entrees arrived within 20 minutes and were served piping hot. The burger was perfect and the fries were delicious, being hot, crispy, and flavorful. The buffalo chicken tacos had a nice fresh spicy taste. You can tell these folks really care about the presentation of the food.   While we dined, Trixie checked in on us, making sure we were always doing alright. She made some nice small talk with us and made us feel very welcome.   We ate half of our plates and doggie bagged the rest as we were in the mood for dessert.  We chose the cookies and ice cream; 3 freshly baked cookies served warm and vanilla bean ice cream drizzled in caramel with chocolate chips. What a fantastic dessert, we really enjoyed the mix of warm and cold sweetness.   What a great dining experience. 5 Star Food, and 5 Star Service from Trixie!"}
{"text":"I don't want to be a negative nancy but this place just doesn't have a wow factor. It still deserves a 3/5 though because there isn't a lot of choices in the area when it comes to chain restaurants. It had been either moxies, milestones, jack astors or baton rouge so we were pretty excited when this place opened up.  Overall: 3/5 Great place to hangout and socialize with friends in the area if downtown is too far for you folks.  Service: 3/5 nothing spectacular but also nothing bad to say.   Drinks: 2.5/5 one rotating tap of craft beer.. which is better than nothing. Cocktail was just okay, tasted like juice to me (I bartend, I am allowed to be critical: )  Food: 3/5 I had the short rib poutine that everyone raved about. Good but not good enough for me to order again. My fiancé had the steak, very juicy and delicious. We also subbed the regular fries with dragon roll (not authentic, but I didn't mind it).   Conclusions: I would come back to have drinks with friends. They have a pretty extensive app menu. However, food is not up to this foodie's standard, I wouldn't come back here for food.  Cheers xx"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for dinner and drinks with my girlfriend.  I have to say from start to finish the service was exceptional. They went above and beyond to make sure we felt welcome and enjoyed ourselves. Sorry I forgot the names because I am writing this the following week. Our waitress introduced ourself and asked us if it was our first time there (which it was) so she went over the menu with us highlighting the popular options. She left to give us some time to decide and the manager came over with complimentary house braised short rib fire cracker appetizers because she heard it was our first time. She said they are the most overlooked thing on the menu and boy was she right. They were the last thing I was thinking of ordering but probably one of the first things I'll order when I go back. We also ordered the parmesan truffle fries, short rib tacos, fish tacos,  smokey club flatbread and social punch. Everything tasted good but the short rib tacos were the standout. I specifically want to come back for those and anything els that has short ribs in or on it. The social punch was also a very nice fruity drink that wasn't overly sweet. The manager and waitress made small talk with us throughout the night and checked on us periodically to make sure we were satisfied. I  am extremly impressed with the professionalism and quality of the food (everything is made in house ) and I look forward to coming back to try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"This opened up recently near my work and it has been packed each time I've gone.  It has a nice relaxed cool vibe.  Great bar area and the restaurant side can accomodate larger groups as well for lunch or dinner.  Though the prices are higher than most restaurants in the area, Union Social does have some great dishes. I've tried their burgers, flat bread pizza, and club sandwich. The club is my favorite with its savory but sweet sauce and crispy shoestring fries. The flat bread pizza had a nice crispy and mildly charred dough but the toppings seem skimpy.   The service was personable and attentive.  It's clear they're catering to the guys.  The wait staff were all young ladies in very tight fitting outfits.  Not a lot of skin is showing but it's easy to tell what their dress size.  Overall, it's a great atmosphere but the prices might be too high for weekly office lunches.  With no alcohol, my meals were over $20 with tip and tax."}
{"text":"First of all, the service is amazing here. You can tell that the wait staff really stands by their food and are extremely attentive. We mentioned to our waiter that it was our first time and the manager came out with a delicious fried roll filled with delicious cheese and meat on the house. Now that's service!  We ordered the buffalo chicken tacos, Caesar salad, burger and panong curry. Everything was delicious but I wasn't a huge fan of the curry. I was expecting something with a little bit more heat and flavor and felt the dish was a bit one note. The thing was, we had ordered so much food, I was pretty full with the few bites I had of it. Our waitress noticed and being the best and sweetest person, took my dish off the bill (something so simple, yet it rarely happens).  We topped off our meal with the mar brownie sundae with mint chip and it was amaaaazing. This place was so wonderful to us start to finish, it was hard to give them any less than five stars!"}
{"text":"I love the patio here. Patios are rare in North York, and when two business that were here previously went under, it always left a gaping hole. Now it's been filled up by Union Social Eatery. Menu are pretty diverse and good portion/price. Everything I have had there tastes pretty good, and everyday they have a drink special which already half won me over. Very friendly staff, good food, good drinks, can't really go wrong."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch and dinner. This place provides a more upscale experience to dine out. The hostess are pleasant and got us a clean high chair for my son.   I like this place becuase they have their own spin on typical dishes. I also liked their entree salade options and you can add grilled chicken or salmon on top. My son was also able to choose from a kids menu and they brought our food fast becuase he was being squirmy."}
{"text":"Salmon Steak? 5/5 Delicious! It was cooked to perfection with creamy dill dressing on the side. I substituted rice for Candy Salad, and it's the best Salad I've had at a restaurant.  Almond Crusted Chicken 4.5/5 It's unique. Not your typical menu at restaurants. Honestly think it's over hyped, but still delicious. Nothing mind blowing though.  Service 4/5 Lost one star because when I substituted my side, she didn't disclose extra charges. She didnt seem very genuine but at least she made an effort!   I would return to try more of their unique items on the menu!"}
{"text":"First thing you notice when you walk into this restaurant is the smiling staff. They were all great and made my experience enjoyable. They were friendly and attentive even though it was quite busy.   I didn't expect the food to be as good it was, but I was pleasantly satisfied. Union Social is probably one of the best chain restaurants that I have been to. I'll definitely be back in the future (especially to check out their patio!)"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this local eatery after reading reviews and sadly had a disappointing experience there this evening in regards to the food and menu options available.  My friend and I were able to easily get a seat on the rooftop patio which was a nice treat on the beautiful summer day.  We had planned to order a variety of appetizers to share between us and our server informed us that over the weekend they ran out of corn chips, naan, and tortillas.  This meant that we were unable to order anything on the menu that contained this items, such as chips/dip, tacos, etc.  My friend ordered a bottled beer and I asked for a Sapporo which was on tap.  About 15 minutes later our waitress returned and informed me that the Sapporo keg was being changed by the bartender and my drink would be along in a few more minutes.  Approximately 10 minutes after that update, our waitress returned and stated there actually was no more Sapporo.  At that point I opted for a Corona which I received a few minutes later.  Our food arrived shortly after our drinks.  The Buffalo Butter wings were essentially coated in Frank's Red Hot Sauce, a flavour that's hard to miss.  The truffle fries were okay.  Heavy on the rosemary, I couldn't taste any truffle and the parmesan cheese on top was similar consistency to bagged shredded cheese.  The calamari was quite tasty and well seasoned.  The Epic Cheeseburger was flavourful, soft brioche-style bun, and mixture of cheese was great.  The Short Rib Firecrackers were not palatable to me and my friend took a couple of bites and said it did not sit well with her either.  The beef added texture, but the mix of cream cheese and other melted cheese inside the fried phylo dough was an odd companion to the thai sweet chilli style sauce it came with.  The same sauce offered with the calamari.  About 45 minutes after arriving, when my friend and I were almost done our meals and ready to settle the bill, our waitress returned to the table and stated that the kitchen had \"finished preparing some shells\" and that if we wanted there were enough for a few tacos.  We were not impressed by this at all and at this point did not care to try anything else.  I still do not understand where they found these tortilla shells all of a sudden.  The waitress stated the kitchen had been working hard to prepare for the dinner rush, but did not quite make it.  So I'm not sure if these items are made in house, or they found some leftover, or got a small delivery.  I would say about 10 minutes after that the table across from us had a plate of nachos dropped off.    At no point during our visit did any kitchen staff or management come to our table to offer any explanation or apology.  Although polite and attentive, our waitress was left to try and offer an excuse or explanation for the lack of food available and then the sudden appearance of some of the items in the kitchen some time later.  I would have appreciated this show of caring and concern for their customers from the restaurant.  We did not receive any free or complimentary items.  We paid and left and will likely not be returning to this restaurant any time soon with calling ahead to make sure the complete menu is available to order.  This was not indicated my the hostess on arrival nor was it posted on any notice board in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I got the almond crusted chicken since it was recommended on here it was dry and the fries not special the customer service was great from everyone the music was good my bf ate the banana coconut crusted chicken it was burnt and the rice was very plain that it came with. We also tried the buffalo tacos which was the best thing we ate I would come back to eat more tAcos. The truffle fries were nothing special. I will come back to try a hamburger or more tacos"}
{"text":"I've been to this location and the one on Yonge/St Clair, and the latter is much better.  Pretty disappointed. Ordered their Cease and Desist burger without the sauce, due to dietary restrictions. I got my order, and found the sauce still in it.  No problem - I told the waiter and she sent it back without hesitation. The problem stemmed from the kitchen, who decided scraping off the sauce and sending it back was a great idea. I could still see remnants of the sauce still on and not only that, the burger patty split into four pieces. Figured it was best not to send it back again, because who knows.  Definitely not coming back here."}
{"text":"I've come here countless times with my family and the food and service is consistently good.  Everything we've eaten is delicious.  We've tried the truffle fries, short rib poutine, cease and desist burger, almond crusted chicken tenders, banana and coconut chicken, brie chicken, mahi mahi and the steak.  Most recently I had the shrimp tacos.  There were 5 shrimp per taco and the tortilla was too small to accommodate them all but it was very plentiful.  They have seasonal creme brulee and I've tried and peach and Lindt chocolate with candy cane topping, both were so good.  We will continue coming back because we've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Easter Sunday brunch was filling and delicious. 3 or 4 had the burgers with great reviews. Not over cooked, favorable, juicy and a good size. The service was also fantastic.  Deja was our waitress; always checking in to make sure we were content and she didn't forget anything. The only negative, was the pickle game, to really bring things up a notch....they should get a better pickle for the plate, it was limp and way to salty. All and all, great meal, thanks!!"}
{"text":"Went here with friends for lunch and it was a nice experience. A decent menu and friendly staff. No complain"}
{"text":"Good place to hang out with friends, very friendly and helpful staff they make sure that customers are well served. Food is good, they offer us a complimentary appetizer when they knew it was our first time there."}
{"text":"Great food great service! Lived up to the other reviews. Excellent choice of you want a fun atmosphere with inventive delicious food at Yonge and Shepard big recommend. The apps are diverse and really high quality and there is something for everyone on the menu. Dragon roll as the side on your main is a recommended choice."}
{"text":"As soon as we entered the restaurant we were asked if we had a reservation even though it didn't look like we needed one. We were seated shortly. It took about 10-15mins before the server attended us. The decor, ambience, and music are minimalistic and upbeat. It has loud music and we had to speak loudly to hear each other. It seemed like a really chill place to hangout with family and friends. The food was good and the portion sizes were very generous. I wish they had a little more options for dessert."}
{"text":"I spent the early part of my new years eve evening at Union Social Eatery.  Some west end friends recommended it, since we were looking for a a good, comfy place with good food that wouldn't charge an arm and a leg.  The staff was friendly and attentive and fun (I actually felt like they didn't mind working on NYE) To start, we had delicious unique cocktails and several appetizers (edamame, dragon roll, ahi tuna poke).  All were excellent.  The were offering a 3 course fixe prixe menu that included prime beef, delicious garlicky caesar salad and a dessert (I had the Lindt Chocolate creme brulee).  I wish I lived closer, it's the kind of place that I would love to have near me.  I can see it becoming my go to west end restaurant.  Enjoy.  Definitely worth going to."}
{"text":"I finally tried their food here. The burger is great! Chicken and bacon flatbread tasted like tacos. Even though it's a starter, it was so big that I couldn't finish it. The floors on the mainfloor are very slippery! watch out when you're heading to the bathroom. The place is very crowded on Fridays. We got lucky we found a seat. Once we were done with dinner, we sat by the firepit and finished the pitcher. There's a special on Domestic beer on Friday nights for $15. It seems like a cool hangout place for summer nights with the cool breeze and upbeat music."}
{"text":"Modern atmosphere with decent food and good service. Prices are reasonable. Good date night spot    Food 4/5 Experience 4/5"}
{"text":"Finally filling up the space left behind by Shoeless Joes, followed by the short-lived Estrella Taqueria, Union Social opened in time for the huge roof top patio to be enjoyed this summer!   We made reservations for a Saturday evening and scored a table up top. For a hot summers evening, the place was surprisingly not too busy (but maybe bc it is still new or many people head up north on the good weekends). Service was friendly and quick, tables were comfortable enough, and the place is pretty spacious.  They had some drink specials, though we opted for a pitcher of beer, which was reasonably priced.  Only downfall is the food. Not horrible, but not great. Typical 'white' restaurant food. We shared the chicken tacos and truffle oil fries - these were the better dishes of the evening. However the fish and chips & the banana chicken left something to be desired.  I will be back since the patio is awesome and drinks are reasonably priced, but will avoid eating there if possible."}
{"text":"A great new addition to the St Clair and Yonge scene. Fresh and diverse menu with great atmosphere. Certainly a new favourite."}
{"text":"I'm sitting down to dinner of leftover almond-encrusted chicken tenders and hand-cut fries. Leftover because the portion was WAY generous last night, so I ended up with two meals for the price of one. It wasn't the absolute best I've ever had, but definitely worth taking home for a second meal, and both the accompanying dipping sauces had kick to it.   My friend ordered the Banana Coconut Crusted Chicken and enjoyed it greatly.  Our only disappointment was that we realized, on arriving, that we'd made the reservations for Winterlicious but hadn't realized Winterlicious ended the evening before. Oh well - we knew we'd enjoy it anyway. But when we happened to mention to our server, Jenny, that we'd mucked up the dates and had been trying for Winterlicious, she surprised us with an on-the-house of Mars Bar Brownie, which was... ye gods. Scrumptious. So rich that with two of us we couldn't finish it, but ... definitely a treat for the chocoholic in your life.  The ambiance was good though a wee bit loud if your party is made of quiet speakers. The food was definitely above-average, and the crowd mixed enough (from just-out-of-college to grey-haired) that I didn't feel too young or too old there, though I couldn't help but notice that at the time I was there, my guest was the only person of colour I saw. A VERY white crowd."}
{"text":"Came here twice over the summer and sat on the patio - really great looking patio but BEWARE of the bees!! They don't leave you alone at all. I would request for a table away from flowers if possible. The bees do take away from the dining experience unfortunately.   I've had the Korean short rib tacos and the almond crusted chicken tenders and both options were average. The tacos definitely sound better than it tastes and I found myself very underwhelmed after reading reviews from other Yelpers. The meat wasn't as juicy it flavorful as j had hoped. The chicken tenders is an interesting item with it being covered in almonds - you definitely taste a bit of the almonds but overall is no different from regular chicken fingers.   The best part of the restaurant is the friendly servers - A+"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today with my team as its our go-to place when we want to head out for a quick meal and a couple drinks. We made a reservation as this place is always packed. The place is super casual and as hipster as you can get in the area (which is not very as it is a business park). We were seated quickly, the waitress was quick and very nice and took our drink orders right away.   As soon as our drinks came she took our orders and the whole process is so smooth despite how chaotically busy it always is. I ordered the spinach salad with the salmon which was pretty good. The salad was typical but the salmon was moist and cooked perfectly. Yay!   My friend had sushi and the calamari both of which she really liked. We also had the house braised short rib firecrackers which were delicious! It was most probably not healthy but it was so good I didn't care.   After coming here so many times I am really happy with the consistent quality of food, service, and bustling atmosphere. Definitely one of my favourite places in the area so check it out if you're nearby!"}
{"text":"Extraordinary service and delicious food in a friendly setting. My daughter and I visited early on a Saturday night. We were seated immediately and greeted by our awesome server Kaleigh. We enjoyed a smoke burger and the almond-crusted chicken tenders. During our time there, we were visited by Matt, Esther, and Ashley to see that we were happy and enjoying our meal. Finished off with a scotch and dessert. I'd highly recommend this place. Easy walk from Yonge-Sheppard subway stop. Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere for a great price!  Came here tonight when the Jays were playing and the staff were totally cool, considering how busy it was. Everyone was cheering, and although our table was far away from the TVs, our server kept us updated with the score.  Got the almond crusted chicken tenders with truffle fries and the fish and chips. Everything was good - my friend especially liked the sauces that came with the chicken tenders. The truffle fries were really good, but a bit heavy so it was nice to switch it up with regular fries throughout the meal.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and it's usually always been a good experience. Some of the food items are incredible such as the almond chicken fingers, chicken curry noodle bowl and the burgers. They also have drink specials everyday of the week which makes it a great after work spot. The service is a bit lacking at times but it really depends on the night. I wouldn't go out of my way to check this place out but if you live or work In the area and want a great portion of food for a good price then this is your spot!"}
{"text":"I love this place, good food and great vibe. My go to hear is the blackened chicken bow tie pasta. I'm not from the area but every time I come to Mississauga I stop by for the pasta and cold and creemore."}
{"text":"I will definitely post another review following another visit to Union Social, as I feel like this review I'll give below will not fully represent the restaurants potential. So, I went here for my birthday lunch, since I've always wanted to try this place but from the outside it looked like a 'special occasion' sort of restaurant. I entered in and to my surprise it was actually a pretty casual place. We were greeted immediately by a friendly server and taken to a table. It was still pretty early but the restaurant was already busy. As we sat more people kept on entering in, which showed how well the place does. The reason I was so intrigued by this restaurant was that their menu had a lot of variety- from sushi to tacos. So, the prices were a bit high, but typical for such sort of bar and grills.  I ordered the candy house salad with grilled chicken (which is why I feel my review isn't really fair) because I knew that my dinner will be large, so I opted for the lightest option. My friend got the West coast veggie burger with truffle fries. yeap...he surely splurged and apparently it was worth it. Mine was pretty good, but nothing extraordinary since it was just a salad.  The service was great and efficient, food came in a timely manner, the decor and ambiance was great, and prices were slightly steep but expected. Next time I'll return and try perhaps the salmon and bahn mi tacos. Not a bad restaurant if you want a change from your usual bar and grill."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Service was wonderful! I had the epic cheeseburger and truffle fries, both were delicious! And incredibly indulgent. The menu has a lot of great items, I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"In town from the US on business, my coworker and I stopped here for dinner.  We were both pretty disappointed after seeing all of the good reviews. Between us we ordered the swordfish tacos, tuna sliders, candy salad with shrimp, and spinach salad with chicken. All of it was tasteless. The salads had all the ingredients to be great but somehow didn't work.  We were also being attacked by some very persistent gnats the whole time.  Decided to go with dessert and picked the Mars brownie, it was warm and the ice cream was good. But overall, it was ok.  Our server was friendly. No complaints there. Seemed expensive too for what we got so probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great service and food is amazing!! No matter what I've ordered the food has always been on point, awesome flavours keeps me wanting more. Would recommend"}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of this restaurant, but I must say it has gone downhill significantly. First thing is the change of the menu- many things I used to enjoy getting were no longer available. I used to get the Carbonara but it is no longer on the menu. There was another spring roll thing I used to get as an appetizer, no longer on the menu. The almond crusted chicken tenders used to be almond crusted. These did not compare at all to the way they were before. AND they used to come on a neat plate with three dipping sauces. Now there are two little thimble sized things of dipping sauce. The fries were droppy and looked like the bottom of the basket. One of my party ordered poutine, and the fries came plain. I asked about the poutine and instead of just going and getting the poutine, the waitress took his plate away and came back with a bowl of fries with some melted cheese, that was NOT poutine! We have raved about poutine here in Canada, he is from California, and they served him some soggy gravy fries with melted cheese- no curd. The burgers were ok, they used to be GREAT. We ordered the cookies and ice cream desert, and this too has changed. It used to be a big cookie and what tasted like homemade vanilla ice cream. These cookies were not much bigger than a chips ahoy, and the ice cream is different, and they put these tiny very hard chocolate chips over the top of everything- they were semi sweet bits and NOT good. I do not know why things have changed so much, but last night was my last trip to Union Social. Too bad...."}
{"text":"Just the average standard. I had the Korean Beef Tacos. It's okay but nothing special. Good place to hang out or relax after work."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last week. Party of 6 (3 couples).  The staff was fantastic, drinks were delicious. I ordered a salad which was great except they served me fried chicken instead of baked. They also screwed up one of our meal orders as well but corrected it right way. Overall a good experience and I'll definitely go back. Had it not been for the 2 mishaps it would be a 5 star rating :)"}
{"text":"The Chicken Vindaloo was the highlight of my day. Adorned with two pieces of warm, crispy naan, the flavors of the chicken balanced well with the perfect serving of rice underneath. Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu, most likely tomorrow."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past two weeks, and had good experiences both times, although the first (5 stars) was slightly better than the second (4 stars), thus averaging out to a 4.5. The first time I came with one other co-worker, and we were seated near the front of the restaurant. The service was really awesome, and after our waitress discovered it was our first time there, the restaurant manager popped by to offer us some complimentary appetizer (I think it was the house braised short rib firecrackers - really good) and chat with us a bit. I was super pleased and impressed! My co-worker and I both ordered the same thing, the candy house salad with chicken, and we both agreed afterwards that it was so good... I would definitely order it again. It had sugared walnuts, mango, black fig, feta cheese, roasted red pepper, and maple-pommery vinaigrette, and was slightly sweet, which made it delicious.   The second time, I came here with a group of 7 people. We didn't make a reservation beforehand, but luckily didn't have to wait at all and were seated at a large table near the back of the restaurant. This time, I ordered the epic cheeseburger (with three different types of cheeses melted on the patty), and got a side of parmesan truffle fries (per Yelp recommendations) for an extra $3. To be honest, I ended up being a little bit let down by the fries - they were good, and the truffle flavour was pretty strong, and I still ended up enjoying them, but I was expecting the cheesy flavour to be stronger, so I was a bit disappointed. I will say that the burger also really good, really cheesy, really thick, and really juicy... but really greasy. Didn't stop me from enjoying it thoroughly though. Service was a bit lacking this time. Perhaps because of where we were seated, I guess it was hard for the staff to see us, so we felt a little bit ignored.   The food is definitely pretty good, I think everyone in my party enjoyed what they ordered. And the prices are pretty decent as well, because I think everything on their menu is under $20, and they have different drink specials every day. It's a big, spacious restaurant with pretty cool decor (mason jar lights, wood, etc.) and quite honestly seems like a cool place to chill and grab a few drinks at after work. Would definitely recommend checking this place out, super fun and awesome vibe, and I'm hoping to return soon!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and sat at the bar.  I ordered the eggs Benedict with pancetta but was told they don't have pancetta and could make it with bacon. Very disappointing, but okay.  Food was okay, given the substitute. The mimosas were better. The bar staff was friendly despite my brunch date making weird comments (sorry!)"}
{"text":"Solid atmosphere and well priced food. Restaurant was slammed on a wintery Saturday night. A gem in the northern suburbs. Waitresses were stressed because they were so busy but still made a clear effort to show hospitality."}
{"text":"Nice menu, good staff, but very, very loud. Happy to get outside once dinner was over. We met a woman outside who changed her mind on eating there for that reason. Too Loud! Two of my colleagues had problems with their food. Steak over grilled, salmon just so so. This restaurant should not be taken as a place that does these food items well. Almost want to say it's a bar where people come after work and order just bar apps."}
{"text":"Honestly, if you have any celebrations, this is the place to go to!! I went to the one on Yonge street for my Bachelorette party and the female manager was extremely kind and thoughtful that evening. And yes, we got a brownie dessert on the house which was unexpected. This restaurant knows ALL ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE. They make you smile and want to come back!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food.  Loved the pasta I had, amazing ambiance and ofcourse really good drinks menu."}
{"text":"Came in at 5:30 pm to find patio seat at the bar in rooftop but hostess stopped me from going upstairs. She asked if I was meeting people. I said no I am here alone, is that a problem? She said there may be no more room for one person because they're busy right now. She called upstairs to patio bar and nobody answered. She asked me to wait while she went upstairs to check, returned and told me to head on up. I was surprised half the seats on patio were unoccupied and NOT A SINGLE PERSON was seated at the bar. Yet they made me wait. Maybe hoping I would change my mind."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's become our go to restaurant. A bit noisy, since they don't seem to want to dampen the sound, be we keep going back again and again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.  Food potion was big and large for the price but seasoning is little bland for my liking.. would add bit of salt over all.  Otherwise all great!"}
{"text":"I would give more than 5 stars for the Mississauga location and 3.5 - 4 stars for the St.Clair location. The only reason why the St.Clair location would get a lower star rating is for the simple fact that some of waitresses were taking shots the WHOLE time my boyfriend and I were dining. Which probably explained why we had to ask for our third round of drinks over again- regardless they were friendly and the food was bomb- so can't complain.  Menu: Excellent variety, great price point and exceptional quality and portion size. I've had numerous things off the menu either for sharing or as an entree.  - parmesan truffle fries: DELICIOUS. The flavour of the overall fries were delicious and I loved the combination of the cheese, rosemary and truffle oil.  - nachitos: AMAZING. A nice spin on classic nachos as the salsa and sour cream come in corn tortilla cups. Very filling and great for sharing.  - smoked chicken quesadilla: MUST TRY. The flavour, portion size and dipping sauces are great. I'm not sure what they do to the tortilla bread- i'm thinking they dust it with a spice of some sort and then grill/bake it or something. Whatever it is, it's perfect and adds a nice kick to the quesadillas.   - smoky club flatbread: TO DIE FOR. We had everyone at the table try it and they all agreed that it was one of the best flat breads they have tasted. Great blend of cheeses and the grilled chicken with the the smoked bacon and garlic aioli work wonderful together. Consider this starter if you have a group of 2 or more.  - epic cheeseburger / roasted mushroom melt burger: both great options for a burger. Loved the cremini mushrooms in the burger, it was wonderfully sautéed and tasted great. The burgers were juicy but not greasy and the side fries were hand cut and fresh!  - Ache High Club: My boyfriend had this and said it was some of the best sandwiches he's ever had. He was a little skeptical at first with the cranberry focaccia but he said the sweetness of it complimented the sandwich and that it was very filling.  - Chicken Vindaloo: My boyfriend also couldn't stop raving about how delicious this was. I also tried it and it was great! Newer addition to their menu but worth trying if you enjoy Indian food. It is not in any way over powering.  Atmosphere: Cozy, rustic and great for groups or date night. The chairs are comfortable and extremely big which gives you the impression they want you to stay a bit.   I HIGHLY recommend checking this place out. You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"The place is awesome. Had the fish and chips with the caesar salad with almond crusted chicken. The patio is more casual looking and feeling than the Jack Astors patio. The staff if really friendly and the crowd is a young working crowd. The dessert we got as a great for being first timers which is always an incentive to try the place out. They also had the steigl Rader which I find hard to find for a restaurant that provides it. The dessert was a brownie like square. It was really sweet and filling."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with coworkers, both as a small group (3) and as a large group (10) and they have been able to seat us without a problem. This place gets quite busy during lunch time and it's no wonder. I have their burgers each time I eat here and am amazed at how good it tastes. I highly recommend the smokehouse burger. My co-workers were quite happy with their burgers as well. The service here is above average.  Update: This restaurant has become a popular place for lunch. It's highly recommended to make reservations ahead of time."}
{"text":"Their website says they have the brunch menu, but when I actually went to the place, they told me they no longer have it. I dont like burgers, just came for a brunch meal but I had no choice. They should have removed the brunch menu on the website!!!!  And when I ate there alone, It was clear that all the staffs were not interested in a girl earing alone with a basic attitude- getting orders, give the food and get paid. Thats okay, but they all become noisy chatty girls when serving groups, expecting friendly tips. Thats okay too, It seems normal to me. Every place is like that."}
{"text":"This was one of the best experiences I have had dining out!  The staff was refreshingly attentive and the food and beer choices were outstanding. Well done Union Social!"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  The burgers here. The burger bread is made in house and hand pressed so it's soft and fluffy and tastes delicious. Fries are also freshly hand cut and deep fried.   I tried a lot of things off their menu and they're all generally great options! Salads are good. I especially like the candy house salad because of the black fig and candied walnut combination.   I tried the chicken panang noodle bowl and what I thought originally a small dish turned out to my surprise because it was filling and I still couldn't finish it! It's on the spicier side though but the curry spice in this dish smells really aromatic.   The almond crusted chicken was delicious too and what I thought was a mediocre dish actually excited my taste buds after I dipped the chicken fingers in the maple Dijon and their U.S.E. Sauce.   Last tip?!  If you're coming here over lunch over the weekdays, make sure to make reservations because this restaurant tends to be packed over lunch on weekdays because a lot of industrial buildings are nearby. Take advantage of their daily deals so ask what's the special the day you plan to visit this place. Ex. Tuesday's are $1 off Stella's beer."}
{"text":"Great location and staffs were friendly and attentive. Food was freshly made on the spot. Even though our server made a mistake and gave us an ice tea instead of a long island ice tea, she quickly fixed the order and gave us a new one. The manager also knew that it was our first time trying the restaurant and gave us a free appetizer! Awesome service! Will definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"Great staff! The food was alright. We tried the nachos and tacos. It could have been better. However, the service was really good."}
{"text":"I had their thai dish a few weeks back and thought it should get some recognition. It was really flavourful and well balanced. Sometimes certain flavours take over but I think it was just right!"}
{"text":"Solid eatery/bar.  There is a dining area and a bar area.  Three huge screens behind the bar with an awesome and friendly bartender.  A great option for a quick bite after leaving Toronto Pearson airport and heading west."}
{"text":"Went there last night.Patio wasn't open due to weather.   Service was very slow. Took forever to get our food, dessert menu and the bill.   Boyfriend had the mushroom melts burger. I had the almond crusted chicken tender. Nothing really special about my dish. Boyfriend's burger tasted good but he had to use the bathroom few times in the middle of night. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The service was above and beyond anything we expected- they even brought us a complimentary appetizer (the firecrackers) since it was our first time here. We had a martini, the killer chicken sandwich, truffle fries and a salad. Everything was extremely flavorful and a perfect amount of food. I can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"I will start by pointing out that Union at Yonge and Sheppard and Union at Yonge and St. Clair are very different. The one at Yonge and Sheppard feels more like Jack Astors atmosphere wise; the one at St. Clair is more of a small ( and kind of fancy) restaurant with just a couple of TVs. So if you want to have a conversation with whoever you are going out with, go to St. Clair location; if you want to watch a sports event, go to Sheppard location. It's got tons of TVs.  Now, I absolutely have to mention food. It is so much better that at comparable bars. The variety and quality are both 10/10 for me."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Great menu with lots of variety, and cool patio. The French fries are some of the best in the city and they have a large assortment of unique and tasty appetizers. They serve great brunch too.   Definitely a place worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Ahhh, Union. The food here might be kinda greasy, but it tastes great! I came here for my birthday and the service was steady, it wasn't super fast, not slow, just a good consistent pace. The place wasn't too packed when we got there, but I'm glad we made reservations because it started filling up during dinner time.  I eat a lot of ketchup, but they don't have ketchup bottles, so I think we might've annoyed the waitress by constantly asking for more ketchup. She would bring four of the little bowls but like I said, I eat a LOT of ketchup. Anyways, she didn't seem annoyed, she seemed more entertained by my constant need for ketchup. Overall, I liked the service & I liked the environment. I also liked how there was wifi xD The place was clean & I had a good birthday (:"}
{"text":"When my parents ask me if they can try some canadian food, I was laughing hard! Why? Cuz Canadians are like Americans. They do not have their roots. You may call me judgemental, but a country with 200-year-history, I doubt they have much time to develop their cuisine very much. But the visit of union social eatery really stunts me that maybe they are developing their cuisine by an unique way that i am not familiar with.  Location: I had no idea why I was. but this place was definitely surrounded by many other food stores. There was not much decoration outside, only a sign saying U.S.E. When you entered inside, you will be overwhelmed by its loud music, full bar, and huge long seats around. Lead to a sofa table, the server came quickly to get our drinks.   Food: Ordered all the popular ones - almond chicken tender, swordfish burger with salad, and veggie burger with fries. To be honest, fries are just so-so. Veggie burger 's sauce is heavenly mixed with green veggies which I have no idea what that is. But just remember, the Veggie Burger is Amazingly GOOD! Side salad is also delicious. Why?Their magic sauce! Last but not least, the best of all - almond chicken tender, the best chicken tender I had all over the world. (JK) but very very very worth of try. And yeah, two sauces to accompany with the chicken are indispensible.  Service: Loud atmosphere but welcoming  Overall: a solid 4 star for foood. OMG, Canadians have their own magics."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my friend who lives in the area. She loves this place and raves about the patio experience. The service is awesome and is probably why it even got two stars but the food and drinks were terrible. We ordered the original Mojito and Long Island ice tea. The Mojito tasted like lime juice and barely had any mint it in and my friends long island ice tea was so strong that she got drunk off of one drink. Luckily we had to walk home. I got the mushroom burger which was extremely bland and the mushrooms were under-cooked and omgosh it was greasy!!! I am not kidding how disgustingly greasy this burger patty was. I hope it was just a bad cook and bar-tender that day cause my friend loves this place otherwise but I am never going back."}
{"text":"Went here last week with the fam and it surpassed my expectations. We ordered a few apps to start - the calamari was ok but it was the vegetable flat bread that was great!!! I would return again and again just for this item on the menu.   For our main we ordered the feature dish which was almond crusted mahi mahi infused with lobster cream sauce with a side of green beans and rice. Overall it wasn't too bad. It was filling! But the fish lacked quite a bit of flavour. I asked for sirracha sauce just to give it a kick. This is where they lose a point in the final rating however we did bring it to the manager's attention. I would not order this again. We skipped dessert as we were very full.   Another plus was the Kronenberg beer they offered. This beer is really good and although they only had the Pilsner (not the stout that I really enjoy) it was still very good.   The ambiance is great. We went during a Raptors game and although were were seated towards the back of the restaurant we still had a good view of the game on several of the Tvs. I would def recommend this spot and will probably visit again soon.   The manager invited us this Thursday Nov. 12 back to the restaurant since, they are having their staff party and the public is invited. They have promised to serve a few samples from their new menu as well as drink samples to celebrate I think their 5th year. Not sure I will there for the celebration but I am sure we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, great food, amazing service!  This place was on the way home from Toronto and we were not disappointed. It is the best service I have ever had at a restaurant. I highly recommend the firecracker starter, the sweet chili Thai dipping sauce was perfect. I ordered the Buffalo tacos and I got three instead of two but I thinking two might have been filling enough with a starter. The truffle fries were not as good as I have had other places however. And for desert we got the Mars bar brownie. It was to die for. I would make the trip in just for this place again."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday (Sunday) with 2 friends around lunch time. I ordered a Pimm's and Ginger which was really good, I downed it pretty quickly.  The food came after about 10-15 minutes I ordered the Smashed Avocado Dip to start and shared it between the 3 of us, that was pretty good as well.   I ordered the Panang  Chicken Noodle Bowl as my main, one friend ordered a burger and the other, fish and chips.  I did not like the noodle bowl the sauce was very bland and bitter not really enough flavour as I expected. I brought the rest home and added more things (sweet sauce and sriracha) to it it make it taste good.  My friend didn't like her coleslaw with her fish and chip so I ate it, it was also bitter, but it was okay.  She liked her dish other than that and the gherkin sauce.     For dessert we ordered the Creme brulée, a brownie, and the cheesecake to share.   Creme brulée was excellent as well as the brownie which was super moist. The cheesecake was not a hit though.    The service was pretty good we always had our waters refilled without asking. And the server gave us recommendations when we asked.  Overall, good experience, would not order the panang bowl or the cheesecake again.  Great environment, good servers, and nice decor."}
{"text":"Great location and decor.   Food was perfect and a decent beer selection. I can see this place being even better on a summer day with the patio/open window viewing a sporting event.   We had two different burgers. Taste, toppings and cook was amazing. Truffle fries are a must try as a side or an appetizers   We were there and it wasn't all that busy. The Service was a little slow, but both servers were very pleasant and helpful. The delay between ordering and receiving your food was the part that took the length of time.    I'd go again and see how the vibe is during the summer months!"}
{"text":"Cool place to grab drinks, nice rooftop patio, the food is good. It's pretty busy on weekends."}
{"text":"My family loves this place; while it's always busy and I would recommend making a reservation if you're more than 4 people, the service and food are forever on par!  Very consistent and great place for traditional fair."}
{"text":"Great patio but too many servers doing nothing....bartender was running the upstairs rooftop patio... Also needs more Ontario craft beers"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice and service was excellent. Food was so-so like I would never choose to come here on my own but if it's a friend's bday or someone is visiting and we are near here then sure. I don't recommend the garlic aioli for fries though we ordered it and it tasted like ranch so we thought there was a mistake so ordered another one (even our server who sniffed it agreed it smelled like ranch) and then the new one tasted the same so clearly they have no idea how to make garlic aioli."}
{"text":"Will absolutely will go again if I am up at Mississauga. Service was great, food was great and the environment was a bit loud, but I can't complain! My friend and I had the \"Nachitos,\" which were one of the best nachos I've had, the \"Roasted Garlic Caesar, with grilled tiger shrimp,\" which was a typical caesar salad (couldn't taste much of the garlic), and we also tried their \"Grilled Swordfish Burger,\" which was pretty awesome.  Overall, it was a fantastic experience. Will recommend!"}
{"text":"So good. The service rocks. The Blackened Chicken Cappellini was so amazing. The Brie Double Chicken was also nuts. Definitely the place to be in Mississaugie."}
{"text":"Is a nice place for lunch and catching the game.  Menu isn't extensive but they have a few good staples.  Decent prices, good staff. The pasta, salads and sandwiches have a special touch unlike similar restaurants.   Come for the food and ambience. You'll enjoy your time here!"}
{"text":"The food was good (we ordered sandwiches and poutine), but the waitress on a Friday night seemed completely uninterested in serving us, and she has passed us multiple times without stopping by.  In fact as I write this review we have waited for 60-90min for her to come by to see how we're doing.  We've had to flagrantly flag her down for every drink.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a casual get together. Ordered the Smokehouse Deluxe Burger it tasted good but felt very greasy. Really enjoyed munching on the fries. Didn't like the service, the waitress was giving us attitude and kept rushing us to order or to get the bill.  Overall, would go again if in the neighbourhood but wouldn't travel all the way from uptown just to eat here."}
{"text":"Great food with homemade ingredients, great drink selection and specials. Relaxed but fun atmosphere. Extremely friendly and quality service from servers and managers."}
{"text":"Yuuummmmy and great service! We ordered the short rib firecrackers and the Chicken Club flatbread. Both were very tasty and went down well with our $17 pitcher of beer.  Will definitely order mains the next time I visit."}
{"text":"i recently visited Union Social Eatery for the first time.  I've heard good things about the restaurant so my expectations were somewhat high upon walking in. For the appetizer, my family and I decided to try the parmesan truffle fries. The fries were ok.. a little too greasy for my liking and the truffle flavour wasn't really there. For my main course I decided to try the West coast veggie burger. It was delicious! In all, the food was good, but not amazing."}
{"text":"Delicious! Friendly staff! Very loud so it's hard to talk but the food is so good and the decor/atmosphere is great."}
