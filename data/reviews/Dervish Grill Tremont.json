{"text":"This place doesn't look much different than the Istanbul Grill that was previously in the same location. I think they even painted over the old sign.  I didn't get a regular meal here, but had the happy hour falafel, which was pretty darn good for $6. They have a couple of tables on their front sidewalk for outside dining."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Great for gatherings and celebrations. The bread and sauces are excellent (I even bought more bread to take home). Appetizers are mouth watering with a great selection of salads. The portions are generous and tasty. I take my parents and dear friends there when they visit me. Kounafa is amazing and a wonderful finish to a spectacular meal. Their turkish tea is also good.  This will not be a complete review without complimenting the friendly staff. They go above and beyond to satisfy customers. You are met with a smile from when you enter till you leave. Excellent service!!!"}
{"text":"Their water is top grade stuff. Must be spring filtered. Some of the best I've had in the Tremont area."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and de-lish. The service was top notch!! we had a group of 7 so we tried many different dishes and all were like Campbell's um um good!!! I had as my main dish the lamb and filet skewers and we all split a sampler with humus, yogurt, tabouli,  grape leaves and a few other traditional treats."}
{"text":"The food was second to none, unfortunately, a few days after going there and when I checked my bank account, it appears someone double tipped themselves. The charge my bank posted from them was for an amount which doubled the already generous (25%) tip I had left. It's too bad. My advice would be to enjoy this place, but use cash."}
{"text":"Holy Happy Hour. 4 drinks, one appetizer, and two entrees for $32. And it was all amazingly tasty.  The service was fantastic as well. We sat outside on the adorable side patio and at the first sign of rain drops, our waiter came over and told us he was watching the weather on t.v. and there was a storm coming. He had us moved inside to a new table by the window just in time to watch it downpour. I recommend sitting on their patio (on a clear day) with a cold beer, a Gyro and the hummus."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner here last night.  Started with a couple of fatties [the big bottles of Efes, the Budweiser of Turkey (but better)], then my wife and I split an order of grape leaves and the small Shepherds salad. Just perfect.  The salad is a great example of the best in Turkish cuisine -- nothing fancy, but very flavorful and really fresh.  For entrees, wife had shrimp sauté, which was excellent, and I had the mixed grill. Very good beef and lamb, but boy do the Turks know how to marinate & grill chicken (breast meat chunks).  Cut it with a fork, and tremendous flavor.  Good service, nice ambience.  If you like Turkish food, you should go.  If you've never tried it, you should.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"It was great food and good service. The gyro meat in-particular was probably the best I've had. Price was reasonable (especially with a groupon!). No question my wife and I will be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really a very good one. I discovered it on internet. I went on a Sunday afternoon. The place is very cute and welcoming. The personnel is kind and involved. I ordered as starter a Mediterranean salad and as main course a Lamb Shank (I was told that it's prepared during eight hours). I was not disappointed, all was great and very tasty made of fresh ingredients.  I definitely recommend this places. I'll come back."}
{"text":"Dervish Grill is continuing the Istanbul Grill tradition in Tremont.   I would highly recommend the Dervish version of Iskender, and am glad to see the return of Stuffed Cabbage rolls.  The Dervish Kebab is new to the menu, a filet mignon based beef kebab, that melts in your mouth.  As for appetizers, I was impressed with their Ezme and Haydari.   And of course baklava with ice cream.   hmmm  Istanbul Grill's old chef plans to continue on with his Food Truck coming up soon.   I will publicize here, as well as the Istanbul Grill's website of his whereabouts."}
{"text":"We had a group of 6 on a Saturday evening and for all of us it was a very pleasant experience and good value.  I've seen some reviews critical of the service, but for us it was excellent - very efficient, very helpful, very personable and very friendly.  We were treated as honored friends - it was fun!.  Our bill for 6 which included a bottle of wine, several beers, appetizers & entrees for all, some dessert, some coffee was $189 excl tip.  The food was good and the portions were generous.  I had moussaka and it was delicious - perfectly seasoned and so tasty. Dervish is just like the former Istanbul Grill, except better.  I'd give it 5 stars except I reserve that for the truly exceptional.  But Dervish gets a definite positive recommendation from me!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably delicious. We had the mixed appetizer with hummus, baba ganoush, tabouli, grape leaves--all amazing! Best baba ganoush I've ever had. Their service is also excellent, they are very quick to serve. Get their coffee and ask the server how to drink it--you will enjoy the unique experience :)"}
{"text":"Obsession continues. We LOVE it here. If you like Greek/Mediterranean food you will keep coming back. And just to note the service here is awesome"}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service.  Definely loved the Turkish coffee and tea.   Wife had the Doner Gyro Kebab.  I had the stuffed cabbage."}
{"text":"I got a Groupon gifted to me for Dervish and was pretty excited to try it out. Unfortunately, when we got there, they were inexplicably closed. Everything indicated that they should be open... but nope. Closed. Total waste of time.  A few weeks later we tried again (after calling ahead to make sure our drive wouldn't be wasted again). The waiter was great, very friendly but also didn't interrupt us when we were clearly in the middle of a conversation which I really appreciated.   The food was very good, but it wasn't really that special in my opinion. We had a lamb shank special, it was nicely flavored and very tender. Also had chicken kebab, again it was good but didn't blow me away. I was surprised that we didn't get any bread or something to go with all the sauce.   Generally I would rate it as over-priced. For an appetizer, two entrees, and a bottle of wine, including tip and excluding the $20 off for the Groupon our bill was $80. And neither of us were full."}
{"text":"Good food & service in a nice atmosphere. This was my first time here- has the hummus as an appetizer- it was good and the bread was fresh & tasty. For the mail meal we shared the donor 'gyro' kebabs with rice pilaf. The gyro meat was fattier than I like and didn't have a lot of seasoning but was good With the side of hot sauce. They also had a nice selection of Turkish wines which were tasty. Good service and will definitely try again."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after visiting the Christmas Story house (a brief drive but not within walking distance).  Really enjoyed the food.  Had a late lunch and we were the only two people in the restaurant.  Ordered a doner kebab, lamb sauté and some grape leaves.  Had a draft beer and glass of wine.  Waiter and staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and overall, I think it's a solid place. It's not perfect but I will be returning!   The decor is lovely. It's a really beautiful restaurant. Tables are a little cramped and close together but not bad. The staff is friendly but it took a while for our waiter to approach. He was also definitely Turkish and only seemed to mostly understand us but had trouble with our questions. The bar tender helped out so there were no issues from that.   Food is a bit pricey but there are good happy hour deals! I've had the hummus twice now. It was better the first time for whatever reason but still fine the second time, just not great. The falafel dinner was a bit disappointing as it was basically hummus and a few grilled vegetables with falafel balls on top. Just a little underwhelming. The second time, I got a big salad and added falafel. It was delicious! I really liked it. My boyfriend has had a few different entrees and enjoyed them. They also have nicely seasoned fries! Oh, and the food came out really fast!   Overall, it's a unique place with friendly staff but you may have some mild struggles from the language barrier. No biggie, though. Good food and an excellent happy hour! I'd like to go back for lunch sometime."}
{"text":"I went because there was a $40 for $20 groupon and I'll try anything once, I'll go back because it was delicious!  The prices are still reasonable even without the groupon and the portions were good.  Highly recommend the mixed grill if you're a meat eater and the stuffed grape leaves if you're not.  Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Ok Dervish Grill. The last time I went here was early dinnerish on a Sunday I believe. We were walking around and I believe got a recommendation to try the place. When we walked in you notice it it a pretty small place but typical size for Tremont. Other than that the place was pretty empty. They seated us by a family with two kids who were actually pretty noisy. It's pretty much our luck though every time we go out to eat though.  The waiter was an older gentlemen who could barely speak English but he was very nice. I ordered the White bean salad and my boyfriend got the Lamb shank which was a special. While waiting for the food we got pita and the usual cucumber and hot sauce like dip. Both were very good. Food came out really fast and it was very good. The other draw to this place is they have Kunefe. Which is our favorite dessert. It's not the Kunefe that has the cheese on the bottom and the crust on top, it's the Kunefe that is wrap in Phyllo dough crisps and drenched in simple syrup. The first place we had it was at Zdara and when they closed we found another place in Ohio City had it and then THEY closed. So we thought it wasn't around anymore until here.   After dinner we paid our bill and then the owner/manager came over and gave us a ten percent coupon off because they felt bad we were disturbed by the table next to us. Which they didn't have to do because it wasn't their fault but the thought was nice.  If I had to rate this place by our first experience I would probably give the place 4 or 5 stars. Until, last night......  We bought the Groupon for here because like I said we were a fan from our first experience. We got there and the place was packed. The lady at the door said she had one last table but it was all the way in the back. We were OK with that. She took us to our table which pretty much right in the entrance of the hallway to the bathrooms. The table had no chairs.  The lady asked the busboy to find us chairs. He found one. Then pretty much disappeared. So here we are standing at our table waiting to see if they were going to find another chair. Waiters are passing us, the lady that sat us is walking by us. No one is saying to us \"Oh, I am sorry we are in the process of trying to find you a chair....\" The only way I knew someone was looking for one is I eventually saw the busboy say to someone that he needs to find another chair for us.   About a two to three minutes later he comes with another chair. So we sit down and the busboy brings some water to us and then that was it! No bread, no acknowledgement or anything for about a good maybe 5-8 minutes! All these people pass us and nothing! I understand that there was only two waiters working the floor but some acknowledgement would be nice.  Like a \" I am sorry I will be with you in one moment.\" Something! I work in the restaurant industry. I know how crazy it can get. I am an understandable person. Just say something to us. Not just look at us and pass by!  After the minutes that we waited the server finally comes over and says \"Are you ready?\" No \"Hello\" \"How are you?\" \"I am sorry for the wait.\" Nothing.  We put in our order ask for bread and then just wait. Our food came out and a pretty reasonable rate and of course it was very good again. The whole time we ate no one came over to check on us or even refill our waters. I was watching our server the whole time and it just seemed like he was more focused on taking care of his other tables because they were bigger tables and of course bigger tables bring in more money.....  If he took better care of us we tip pretty good no matter if we have a groupon or not. I am normally not one to give bad tips because I know being a server myself work for my money. But if you treat a table like shit then I am sorry you are going to be tipped like shit. If we ever go back I am going to make sure it is again on a slower day and hopefully not get that server."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and ambiance. Would love to come back.  We were seated on couches they have near the bar- theyre cute and make the bar seem like home. After we place our order, they brought out complimentary warm bread ( baguette type, but softer) with 2 sauces . I had to keep reminding myself not to fill up on it. I got the lamb kababs- omg. They were juicy and marinated so well. My only complaint was that it didn't seem like enough.( 8 pieces i believe? but they were small). It came served with rice and a yogurt sauce .. so good! They have a full bar and an extensive wine menu. The place is really small, bathrooms clean and side street parking.  Definitely plan on returning!"}
{"text":"Fantastic cuisine! Great staff! Great pricing! Don't miss it while you're in Cleveland...And next door, is a unique boutique with a potpourri of neat items...Check out April Snow."}
{"text":"A very nice surprise. We thought we were familiar with Turkish cuisine, but this was definitely a step above. Very fresh. Very flavorful. A very enjoyable meal. Give this little place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"As I've yelped before, I absolutely LOVE Middle Eastern cuisine.  A co-worker and I ventured to Dervish for lunch.   The eatery is tucked away on a cozy Tremont Street.  The entrance is very inviting.   We were seated immediately, by our charming server (there was only 1), he was doing double duty, waiting on customers seated on the patio and also customers inside.  He did a very good job, we never felt neglected.   I ordered the tabouli, Chicken Adana wrap and fries.  The tabouli arrived first with a generous portion of warm flatbread trianagles.  This was not the Lebanese version that I love so much, this was a bit drier with lots of scallions and not much bulgur, but it was fresh and well made.  My meal arrived in record time, hot, fresh and delicious.  The chicken was nicely seasoned, on a bed of lettuce, tomato and red onion, wrapped in warm flatbread.  The fries were of the frozen variety, bu nicely seasoned with seasoned salt and paprika.   This was a very good meal, can't wait to return to try some of the restaurants other menu items."}
{"text":"Dervish grill serves the juiciest, most tender, tastiest kebabs known to the greater Cleveland area, and perhaps the world. It doesn't matter if you order chicken, beef or lamb. I just love how the kebabs mix together with the rice pilaf, shredded lettuce and the little grilled pepper they add on the side. I do beat that little pepper with a passion and mix it with everything, to add FIERY heat to the whole ensemble. So good, like a whirling dervish on your taste buds  This is the same Dervish that used to be in Avon. I have not been here in a while, but in the previous location, I had them on speed dial for take out orders. I have yet to set foot on the new Tremont location, but I'm overdue for a visit, and it's one of the places I definitely miss."}
{"text":"Yes. This is the most romantic, beautiful atmosphere. They have window seats that offer decorative views of stylish lights against a brick wall. They play Turkish music. The wait staff is attentive and the food is amazing. Appetizer Falafel with sauce was tasty! I had a superbly prepared fillet mignon with brown rice and a side salad. My date had a chicken kabob with yogurt. Both were very good! We finished the meal with Turkish coffee for him and Turkish tea for me. Both smelled very enchanting and tasted delicious. Plus they really woke us up. The food came out very fast. This is a wonderful date place! You really must check it out!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for a beer during a walk around the neighborhood. What a find ! Ilhan and the team offer an incredibly warm ambience, great local beers, and a beautiful place. We will go back for the food. The bar area rates 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, great staff, and delicious food! We got a variety of food, my favorite being the dervish kabab. I would recommend this place for a date night or a group of people trying to catch up over dinner. The food was just as good, if not better, than Aladdin's. It's located in tremont, so you can explore the area after you eat!"}
{"text":"Went here with my husband and a friend. It was delicious! We decided to share two meals amongst the three of us since we also did appetizers, and we were all stuffed after. We ordered one plate of the lamb kebab with yogurt and one plate of the chicken kebab with yogurt. Very tasty. The waiter recommended a delicious red wine. My husband and I are tea snobs and their tea was probably the best tea I've ever had in a restaurant. For dessert, get the kanafa. So yum!"}
{"text":"The food was fresh and tasty but the prices are a bit high for what you get.  I went with a friend for lunch in a very quiet area of Tremont. Hopefully more people support the business."}
{"text":"First time here, kept it simple. Got the medium appetizer sampler and a bowl of the chicken vegetable soup. Awesome."}
{"text":"Got a Dervish salad and a fruity wine here 5 months back. Split a hummus. Was very good! Got a soup for a friend to go, service was great~  Sometimes parking can be tough."}
{"text":"Have now been to this restaurant twice since it became Dervish Grill. Istanbul Grill that used to be in this location was good. In the end, it really couldn't compare to my then favorite restaurant, Anatolia's on the other side of town, for this type of food. Sorry, Anatolia's, Dervish is at least just as good and BETTER is some ways and for now is my favorite. For example, the grilled chicken at Anatolia's over the years has been occasionally dry. I have avoided it. It was MEMORABLY moist and savory at Dervish. The flavor of the marinated lamb and beef tickle your palate. Anatolia's has been cutting back on portions, but Dervish's portions (though not as large as Anatolia's were in the past) seem to be larger. Service is always good at Anatolia's. Service has been excellent both times at Dervish (but we did have the same waiter so maybe this is no coincidence). Yes, I will probably still go to Anatolia's when I have something else to do in that neighborhood, like a movie at the Cedar Lee, but I am tempted to favor Dervish for a dedicated dining experience. In fact, my second visit was to bring friends that love Anatolia's for this new experience at Dervish and my third visit is already scheduled this weekend with other friends.  The only critique I would give is the little nothing lettuce on the plates which is too big for a garnish and almost too small to be a side. The first time, blah. Fresher and better the second, so I think they are working on it.  My advice is get rid of it and replace it with something else (ideally grilled), name it something Turkish to make it cute and excusable, or turn it into a real salad side.  If you like Mediterranean food, especially lamb or shish-kabob, do yourself a favor and go here. You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Amazing Mediterrean food.  We ordered the large appetizer and the mixed grill. Not at all disappointed. My friends and I loved it so much, we decided to bring back our spouses this upcoming weekend. I don't understand why this place isn't busier, it should be packed!"}
{"text":"Fresh food and good service! Been here couple times and loved the food and presentation. Their daily specials are great too!"}
{"text":"We intended to go to Lucky's last Saturday and ended up parking in front of Dervish Grill, which had Grand Opening sign displayed.  When we inquired we were told they had Turkish food.  In light of the fact that my wife and I love Middle East food we opted to have lunch here.  The food was great, I had a vegetable dish and my wife a kabob.  Prices were reasonable and the food was great.  However the service was very poor we had ordered Hummus which was never delivered, the same with the tea.  There were not very many people there, so there is really no excuse for this lack of attention by our waiter."}
{"text":"Overall good food.  We got the large mixed appetizer which was amazzinggg. The fresh hot pita bread that kept getting refilled only made it better! For entrees the meats are well cooked and high quality. Is a little over priced in my opinion tho...I think the yogurt dishes probably give you the best bang for your buck, but thanks to the pita bread I did not leave hungry.   Service overall pretty good, took about an hour to get our checks which was ridiculous, but otherwise would recommend it."}
{"text":"I got the deal of the day: Gyro sandwich and Fries for $7.95 !!! What a deal ?!?!?!?! Do not miss it, or they may offer the same combo for $15 later !!!  I do not count the lettuce, tomatoes and other stuff. I pay for the gyro, that is the meat, but I do not think I got the amount of meat that means $8 to me. To be honest, I do not know the weight of the meat, but my guess is it was less than 4 oz, probably 2 oz. You need to tell me buddy how much meat you are offering in your wraps and you should obey your own rules.  In my opinion, $6 for that combo (tasteless gyro wrap & tasteless fries) is more than enough, not a deal of the day, of the week, or the month. If you want to call it a deal, add a free 20 oz drink to the combo and offer it for $6.   I am one of those who misses the tastes offered by Istanbul Grill. Istanbul Grill was offering the similar gyro sandwich & fries even for more: $9. But, I was enjoying fully what I was eating: Their bread, gyro, and even fries, I mean every bite in the package was full with its own flavor and taste.   It is very clear that the previous chief is not there any longer. Where is that chief now? If anyone knows, please write it here. I want to go to his new place and suggest everyone else to pay to the person who knows how to cook Turkish food in prefect way, instead of anyone who runs a Turkish food restaurant with inexperienced cooks."}
{"text":"Mixed grill (meat on meat on meat), local beer, and baklava... Doesn't get much better than that. From start to finish our experience was great (which is good because last time I went rather inebriated and caused a bit of a ruckus, yet they didn't put my picture on the \"do not serve\" wall). The place is intimate, and the staff genuinely wants you to enjoy your experience. Glasses were quickly filled, the pita bread and sauces (free, mind you) were cooked to perfection, and the meat is some of the best flavored you'll find in Cleveland. Go here. Prices are more than reasonable."}
{"text":"So pleasantly surprised eating here.  it is a few blocks from home, and have yet to try until now.  It seemed each time we passed this place at night, it looked rather dead, so nothing was ever piquing my interest to try it.   Well, we finally did and everything was fantastic.    We were greeted with a basket of bread and two dipping sauces.  Traditional turkish perhaps?  A dill creamy sauce and a hot red sauce.  Neither of the two were as good as an oil or butter, but that's fine.    Falaffal was our choice of hot appetizer and it was delicious.  The flavors were perfect and the dipping sauce complimented it wonderfully.    I ordered a chicken and doner kebob combo plate instead of going with one type of meat.   I'd surely recommend if you like little pieces of meat and different flavors in your mouth.  There are about 6 other kebob options that you can combine to get a little of each flavor.  Such different flavors and all were fantastic.    My date ordered the Lamb Saute which was small pieces of lamb mixed with peppers, onions and maybe other veggies, and a tasty red sauce.  I wish I could pinpoint more precisely the flavor other than delicious.  Dip that rice pilaf into that and you got yourself a meal.   Actually, I think I will try that next time.   I also see on their website that they have a great happy hour.  I'm thinking of going back for their $6 wrap with fries, maybe my gyro meat would taste more like the gyro I was craving when it's inside a wrap.  I remember going to Instanbul a bunch for lunch and prices were much more affordable on that menu, so I'm assuming this place is similar (since the menu is strikingly identical)."}
{"text":"From the second we walked in the whole place smelled amazing!!! We had to order take out but everything was great! Our food was ready when promised and the server cashed us out at the bar quickly! We orders the chicken kabob, the chicken sauté and the baba appetizer. Great portion sizes and the bread that came with everything was delicious!! Flavors and quality were good. While getting our food we saw their happy hour menu and it looks great! M-f 4-7- $3 craft beers, 1/2 price apps and more!! We will be back"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! We stopped by as a rest stop on our road trip, and it was the best choice. Great Turkish coffee, amazingly creamy hummus, and to die for lamb. My husband and I both got lamb kebabs with rice and I would recommend it to anyone. The lamb is marinated and is by far some of the most tender lamb I've ever had.   The ambience is very cozy and nicely decorated. The owner is nice and very accommodating. He came by to explain the menu, gave is the hummus, and even offered to charge my phone."}
{"text":"This really is a perfect little eatery that I love visiting.  Their happy hour is an insane deal that I almost feel guilty enjoying.  But not guilty enough to keep me from ordering nearly everything from the HH menu.  Entrees are also fantastic--everything is fresh and tastes like it's made with love. That's a sappy description, but it's true.  The owner is always around and it's great listening to him passionately describe menu items--he's not just making a sale, he's creating a devoted taste tester.  The wine list is solid and the draft beers tend to be on the local side, which is a fantastic bonus.  I truly have no complaints except now I have a big craving for baba..."}
{"text":"My husband and I live in Tremont and have been here many many times. Last night was the second time a server has lied to us about Happy Hour specials.   The first time was several months ago when one server told us baba ganoush was not on the happy hour menu. This was despite the fact that I order it every time I go for happy hour and it's always 1/2 off and we have been told repeatedly every starter except combo platters are on special. We did not go back for over a month because we were so put off. When we returned he was our server again but didn't recognize us. We got the baba 1/2 off on our bill without having to ask.   Last night, we went and were charged full price for hummus and the falafel wrap special. When we asked about the bill he said they're not on special. My husband almost had to argue with him before he took it to the manager who confirmed that they ARE BOTH on special. He came back and told us sorry, he's new. I have seen him there before so clearly he was lying to save face. We will not be going back because it is embarrassing to have to argue over the bill almost every time. Obviously, these servers are worried about being tipped on the 1/2 off price and not the full price so they overcharge hoping people won't notice. For the record, we always tip on what the full price would be. In the future we will be going to Mahas or Nates because A. They are honest and B. They have better falafel and baba anyway. Proximity to our house is not enough to put up with shady servers!   My advice: check your bill thoroughly!"}
{"text":"Great service, okay food. Sat outside on a beautiful day. Started with the multiple mixed app. Would have been better with some pita but was still delicious. Had the shepherds salad with euro meat. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"I bought the Yelp $10 for $20 deal and gave this place a try. First time here. We arrived early at around 5p. The place was completely empty except for us. It was nice and warm however and very cheery inside thanks to all the glass lamps and shades that are for sale and displayed around the place.   The server was very friendly and as expected, since we were the only ones there, we had great service.   The food was really good and the portion sizes were very good. You can see a bit into the kitchen and I got a good feeling that the place was very clean. I ordered the chicken adana and it came with a nice big scoop of rice and a big scoop of (slightly browned) salad. Appetizer was a homemade zucchini pancake and dessert a just out of the oven rice pudding.   A nice addition to Tremont. The only other place I can compare this to is Anatolia Cafe on the east side. I would say these places are pretty similar in terms of how good the food was."}
{"text":"So delicious, and the service is outstanding! Try the mixed appetizer platter, served with fresh bread and lots of delicious vegetarian spreads. We also really enjoyed the mixed grill- a great opportunity to sample a number of the meat offerings like filet mignon, kebabs, and gyro meat.  Long story short, the best Turkish food I have ever tried and definitely the best in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I've been to Dervish a couple of times and both times, I left very happy.  Once we had a big group and they did their best to serve us.    In the large group, we ordered a wide variety of food.  The hummus and Baba Ganush were very good.  In fact, I'm not a big Baba fan, but you could really taste the smokyness of the char-grilled eggplant.  It added a really nice depth to it.  The real crowd pleaser was the Sigara Boregi, which is a feta stuffed cigar shaped phyllo dough.  Zucchini pancakes were a close second, warm, and nicely done with a delicious yogurt sauce on the side.  For entrees, most go the Kebabs (Shish or Adana/ie, ground meat).  They were all moist and nicely flavored.  I personally got the chicken sautee, which was really nice and very filling!  I would recommend it!  The only person that was a little disappointed was the falafal.  It was 4 falafals on a plate of hummus.  Since we'd ordered the hummus appetizer and the falafal appetizer, it was rather uneventful.  The staff was kind enough to bring out some vegetables though to add to the dish when we asked.  Overall the food was great.  Everyone left very full and the Cavs were on TV!  Dervish is a great way to transport to Turkey, right here in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"As a Turkish person, it's hard to find places with the true Turkish taste, and this is one of them. Their food is delicious. I especially like their Iskender kabab. Their Kunefe (a dessert) is superb! Also their Turkish tea is really well made, most places over brew it, theirs is just right! The staff is also great, friendly and great service."}
{"text":"Generous dinner portion of Gyro meat, Yogurt, Pita, Turkish wine, Turkish coffee. Reasonably priced and we were full after wards.  I don't know what home cooked Turkish food tastes like but seems authentic to me.  Everything tasted great also.  Great service twice now coming here.  We like to come here drink the Turkish coffee and \"try\" to read our fortunes from the coffee grounds that remain.  My last fortune from the coffee based on friends reading: I was going to travel somewhere far away.  It also showed a cliff that I may falling off or something in my life is going to have a great crash. I'll need to come back to see if my fortune has changed or if I can get a better interpreter.  Great spot in Tremont. You need to try this place out if you are in the neighborhood.  This place is in my top 10 in Cleveland for food, service, and atmosphere."}
