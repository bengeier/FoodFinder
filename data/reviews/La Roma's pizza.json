{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE, It has real Italian Homemade food, And the Owners are so Nice. HIGHLY recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok change of owners, but the food is great. If you get a chance you got to try this place. People are awesome and very friendly but the food is spectacular. The new owners changed the decor but the food is mouth watering..... Does anyone see the common theme here...... YES THE FOOD IS GREAT!!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service never had the opportunity to try their food. Placed order at 6:40 and server told us e times our order was coming up. At 7:20 I approached the counter and asked where was our pizza. The guy in the kitchen told me it's coming up. I said we had been waiting 40 minutes he said she forgot to enter the order. He said it was coming up. I asked when and he actually blamed me for asking and for having a bad attitude. He said to wait or get my money back. 
I took my money and left. They never apologized or anything of the sort. 
The food looked ok but the service was the worst. Never will I know if their food good or not.  He blamed me for asking about my order. 
Poor poor poor customer service."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Concord area so far.  Used to be Lubrano's and they are carrying on that same quality and goodness we got from them.  My go to pizza place."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Concord. I've ordered 4 times and have been pleased each time. I get the sense they take pride in their pizza."}
{"text":"It's always those small, unassuming store fronts that have great food and friendly service. La Roma's in Concord reaffirms it. They are counter service pizzeria with a nice amount of extras (appetizers, salads, subs and pastas). With so many of these closing around town, this one stays open based on good food, excellent service and quick"}
{"text":"Was just alright. The customer service was good, and in their defense I placed my order 15 minutes before they closed and picked it up 15 minutes after they closed (didn't realize they closed at 8:30 on sundays). 

Wings were not bad, but not great either. 
Fried zucchini...just wouldn't bother. It was chewy and rubbery and soggy and some pieces were not battered and just looked wilted and sad.
The garlic knots were tough in some parts. 
Didn't have the pizza but got a couple of slices for the boyfriend and he said it was actually pretty good...hence the 3 stars and not 2. 

Would I recommend it? Not really. Will I give it another chance...probably not."}
{"text":"Moved here from NJ and FINALLY found good pizza!!!!! Fast good service with excellent pizza!!! Found the place and have ordered here every week since!!!!"}
