{"text":"I come here all the time the general tsao is amazing. Better than any sit down restaurant. Ask for the combo u get more."}
{"text":"Best Hot & Soup in Charlotte.  Extensive menu, helpings very generous and very good. Our favorite Chinese restaurant. Encourage you support the young couple that own the restaurant."}
{"text":"Best takeout we've had since we left NY. New owners know what they are doing. Food is always ready when they say it will be. Try the chicken in balck pepper sauce - chinatown quality."}
{"text":"This is the worst experience and waste of money.I I went into the This Tian Tian restaurant at 245pm.Immediately I was told to order the buffet for 5.00. That's not what I wanted to getFirst of all I'm not a buffet person and it's 245  lunch ends @ 3pm so food is old.We have ordered previously from them when we travel and visit our family in Indian Land and the food was fresh and tasty!This time the owner seemed to get an attitude because I didn't want the buffet food.Like an fool I requested my usual  order of shrimp fried rice,shrimp rolls,shrimp with broccoli and chicken .As soon as I return to  my destination the rice had pork,chicken,shrimp nothing what I ordered the shrimp rolls was so greasy if we had eaten them it would have been an immediate visit to the ER!!!!.The chicken was not fresh disgusting!!! We had to throw everything out.I will never return and I suggest look somewhere else for Chinese food!! no stars !!"}
{"text":"One of the worst places I've have ever eaten. Chicken was like rubber and the dumplings were cold. Anyone who likes this place has never had good food"}
{"text":"I really like this hard working , sincere & striving couple.  She became a US citizen last year and he is trying , but his English is minimal.  They work from  11 - 11 all week .  Saving money to get their other daughter , now a toddler to the. US.  Very sad.  The food is just fine.  Nothing fancy and all good.  By buying meals here I feel that I am helping them unite their family.  Their other daughter comes back from school to do her homework and hang around until closing time."}
{"text":"I find the food yummy. Reminds of typical hole in the wall Chinese restaurants in Southern California. The Shrimp with vegetables is a very generous portion with very large shrimp. You can eat in but nothing fancy. Owner and family very friendly. I think the buffet must be popular as I came after buffet hours and it was picked clean.  I have tried some Asian restaurants in Fort Mill that we had to walk out of. So this one in Indian Land is as the ex-felon Martha Stewart would say, \"A good thing\""}
{"text":"Yuck... that's about all I can really say without being crude.   This restaurant wasn't doing very well a couple of years ago.  So when I saw a sign saying \"new owners, new management, new cooks\" I thought that I should give them another chance.   Whether you think its an over-rated dish or not, I decided to try the General Tso's chicken with fried rice.  The rice was greasy... not moist, but greasy.  The carrots and peas mixed into the rice seem like they might have been there a while, because every bite of the rice had the same greasy flavor with a slight twinge of carrot and pea flavoring.  The chicken was heavily breaded and seemed like it was precooked with a sauce dumped on at the end.  I would consider the taste to be very bland and leaving the dish very lacking in good flavor. Will I go back? No..."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  The same chef is always there and knowing that the restaurant is run by a hard working family makes it even better.  The food is FRESH and you cannot beat the value!!!  Tian Tian will modify or customize if you want, however, I always find that menu items are just the way I like them.    I wish I could rant on and on, because it's hard to really tell how good a restaurant is using words only.  So many Chinese restaurants offer the basic chinese food, and seem to use really small shrimp and un-recognizable meats.  NOT here!  What you get is freshly cooked amazing Chinese takeout with a smile.  To give an example of what I mean about freshness, I once inquired a couple of years ago as to why I couldn't get water chestnuts in my chicken meal.  I was told that they didn't like using canned vegetables and that they couldn't justify the expense of fresh water chestnuts to keep them in stock.  Although I wasn't happy about no water chestnuts, I loved the response, which further justified that they truly do use fresh veggies in their meals.  They used to offer a lunch buffet which locals loved, but I haven't seen this in a while.  No worries, you can still get a great deal on a take out Chinese meal, or eat in.  I honestly, have NEVER eaten in, because I like to order about four different entrees and bring it home for the family to share.  Try this restaurant.  I truly believe that if you have a bad experience (which I doubt), you could go back and talk to them, and they would do something to make it right.  Too many restaurants these days are about quantity versus quality.  This place deserves to stay around for a very long time!!!  And, just to add...as an American Citizen, I find it truly uplifting to know that the owners have taken steps to become Citizens themselves and share family pictures at the register.  It's like \"down home Chinese cooking\" in my book.  I will continue to spend my money there!"}
{"text":"After the first time being here, I wasn't planning to be back, however neighbors really liked it here, so maybe my one time was a fluke.  Tried some lunch specials and they haven't steered wrong yet. Food is delicious and quickly made. Curry chicken is more watery than creamy if you would rather that version.  Beef with broccoli is my go-to dish usually. Portions are heaping. Can't go wrong with your choice."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers very generic Chinese American food, but it is reasonably priced and the food is tasty."}
{"text":"I have been disappointed in the offerings of the local take out places and have frequested the Amazing Wok, on 521 for many years although it's not very amazing.  Upon moving to Indian Land we searched for a new place for take out.  All I can say is the VALUE of what you get here is awesome.  They do not skimp on anything and the entrees are all very good.  We have not had a bad meal there and will continue to go back.  The Crispy Scallion Chicken, Tofu, and shrimp is very tasty.  General Tso's shrimp is also very good with great flavor and they put plenty of sauce and the \"Quart\" option comes with about 13 jumbo shrimp.  Try getting that down the road!  The owners are very nice and accomodating.  One negative is them not offering brown rice....I keep asking so maybe one day we'll get it."}
{"text":"It's edible. Not bad, but definitely not good. I most likely will not be returning, especially since Asian grill in Waxhaw is so closeby."}
