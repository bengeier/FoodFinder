{"text":"5 stars for location only. Rest the owner tried all his/her best not get even a single star. Reason is obvious .first impression. A day before some one referred this location.amazed to hear pakistani sweet in heartland area. But soon u enter inside.all your proudness just fishoooooouun. Door glass,showcase glass full of greasy hands impressions, chairs upside down on tables with full of dust. Easy to imagine the status of ' clean' kitchen ( out of access and sight). Show case was also ' decorated' with different real estate cards. Ordered qeema samosa, price according to market. But quality was questionable. But must say jaliabi was good and sweet. A very little job to clean n keep clean (at least the glass with windex)will boost the image , impact and customers."}
{"text":"~3.5 star ~  Okay folks this is the place where you can get Pakistani samosas at its best. I was hoping for a place to open up near heartland. Indian samosas are good but they are not the same, the only other location in mississauga used to be Pak sweets but that is too far. I was told the owner of Bismillah used to to work with Pak sweets and then split up and opened up this place in Heartland.  I have been coming here for quiet a while you get both the veg and non veg samosas. The samosas are nice, crispy, crunchy and have a nice kick to it. They also sell various sweets/ Methae, Namak para (Namak para is a crunchy savoury snack of Pakistan) and Pakoras. All goodness!!!  This place is always super busy, has few seats  and they only accept cash or debit.   For my Muslim folks - the non veg samosas are halal"}
{"text":"Excellent samosas. Best south Asian/ East Indian sweets in Toronto hands down. But the staff don't speak english and are not organized at all- there's no queues (just free for all), very chaotic, usually busy, and slow to ser. The place is a legit hole in the wall. Expect to wait and don't expect any customer service. But the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Being a Pakistani guy samosas are a standard snack, and throughout my life I've been looking for the best samosas in the GTA. I think my search is finally over. I cannot recommend their vegetarian samosas enough. I would not get the meat samosas as they aren't the best. The vegetarian ones are out of this world and are hands down the best you can get anywhere nearby"}
{"text":"Cute mom and pops shop. The galub juman is amazing!!! Really great desserts and the samosas are so cheap!"}
{"text":"Great place to get anything on their menu. Try anything & you'll be amazed Great representation of Pakistani & South Asian food.  Please keep up the good quality food & affordable prices."}
{"text":"For $2.80 we got 3 vegetable samosas and 2 pieces of gulab jamun. Samosas were hot and wholesome, and best of all, not greasy, with bits of fragrant spices embedded throughout. Good on the go."}
{"text":"They have a wide selection of sweets compared to other stores. The quality of the sweets is exceptional and the price is very reasonable. The service is fast even though it's always busy. My favorite sweet store in all of Mississauga!"}
{"text":"First time I had samosas from here my friends mom brought them to work and I loved them and I just couldn't figure out where she got them from so the next time she brought them I asked where she got them from after a lengthy description of where this place is located from another Co-Worker I was finally able to find it!  So we stopped by for some Samosas today at around 2:30. We ordered 10 chicken 6 vegetable Samosas the total was $7 which is super affordable! It's 3 vegetable Samosas for $1 and 2 chicken Samosas for $1. The Samosas are huge and extremely filling. They're flavourful and are a little spicy not too spicy though!   The staff is friendly enough and the place is always super busy during peak hours. I can't speak for the sweets but a lot of people were ordering them so they must've been pretty good!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best samosas in Mississauga. They also make other very tasty sweets. Pakoras are also good."}
{"text":"Tip:  If you're coming from Mavis/headed West on Britannia, enter on Plymouth as there isn't direct access into the plaza.  From Plymouth, drive behind the Staples, and turn left into the plaza.  Note:  Primarily takeout.  Just grab and go!  CASH & DEBIT ONLY.  The storefront isn't the cleanest.  Tables are off to one-side, not wiped off, most chairs are overturned, on top of the tables with a few chairs for patrons to wait/maybe eat quickly.  Samosas aren't on display, but kept somewhere behind the counter, so you hafta ask for them.  Prices are good though @3 veg for $1, chicken were 2/$1.  Veg Pakoras were $3.99/lb, a bit on the salty side.  Good thing were that both samosas/pakoras were served HOT.  Most likely they were double-fried, upon ordering, based on the colour.  I really don't eat Indian sweets, so I can't comment on them."}
{"text":"Rude and absolutely inconsiderate staff. Worst staff ever. Didn't even have the odacity to mention to people, who are waiting outside their store for an hour while fasting I might add, that their menu is done. No samosa no pakora nothing. Had to find out by a crummy little sign NEXT TO THE REGISTER, that their food is done for the day. If they had even a tiny bit of common sense just out that sign up at the door and save themselves the angry mob. They were asking to be screamed at. Have no sense of consideration."}
{"text":"This is my neighbours favourite sweet shop and rightfully so. Food is great, prices are appropriate and the service is good.  I have tried a variety of sweets like gulab jamuns, barfee, rus gullay etc. They always taste fresh! If you like milk cake then this is the place to go to. I have also had the meat/veggie Samosas which are fried in clean oil. They are generously filled and the shell and nicely crispy. The Jalebis are always freshly fried/hot, crispy and to my family's liking.  Their customer service is amazing and they even let you taste the stuff before you buy it. People who work here are really friendly!  Do give this place a try and you will no regret it."}
