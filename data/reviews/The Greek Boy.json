{"text":"Great food and friendly atmosphere. An amazing amount of food that is fresh and authentic at a reasonable price. My husband I will enjoy the patio when it is ready!
 **Definitely the best place to eat on Pape.**"}
{"text":"been here a couple of times in the past month - sat on the patio and enjoyed dinner - tip:  ask the server what is fresh for the day (my last visit it was roast lamb...tender).  Nice more relaxed alternative to Danforth Greek eateries, but not as cheap as you might think (prices tend to be average) - waitstaff and owner eager to please with good customer service"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It's so close. And I thought with all the competition around that quality would be amazing.
Two ladies were working when I went in...really nice. The guy cooking seemed miserable and even though he was not cooking he would not make eye contact.
Well, everybody has bad days.
Ordered the gyro. While there wasn't any skimping on meat..the meat is why there are two stars (one given to each lady there - great personality). There were pieces there that were so dry and hard as a rock with other pieces so oily and squishy and salty that it made the sandwich inedible. I'm not even sure how those hard dry pieces were so dang dry... there was so much oil that it leaked from the wrapping and all over the brown paper take out bag.
I don't know if I'll be back... so many other Greek places around."}
{"text":"How can this place only have one review? It's a great place for greek food. Did I mention everything here is Greek (as you may expect...)? The newspaper, the TV, and the customers too (well.... except me!). I've walked by this place during weekdays at lunch to see that the restaurant always has customers (older gentlemen probably not of the Yelp'ing crowd) and finally thought I'd try it.

The pork souvlaki was good, not dry and not super oily. The tzaziki sauce also had a good strong garlic-y taste but I thought the salad was only okay. The bread bowl provided leaves me wishing that it were garlic spread.... well, at least it's *healthy*? Free wifi is also provided (the password is the phone number!).

They have a nice patio and it'd be a great place to eat with some friends in the Summer."}
{"text":"While the food was okay to pretty good at a reasonable price for large portions that could easily be split, the restaurant had a pretty stinky seafood smell when we arrived which lingered and bothered me for a while, plus they didn't have two of the three items we wanted from their menu. In addition, when I and my husband were ready to pay, the person in charge of the cash seemed preoccupied for several minutes and we were in a bit of a rush, I would assume that most restaurants would want prompt payment and her delay made us consider leaving without paying. And it was rather loud for a small restaurant. And the menu was only available in their brochure, not above the counters like most fast food places. Probably won't be coming back myself at least."}
{"text":"Great little family run place!  Our server was one of the daughters who was super sweet.  The beer was cold which was fantastic on a warm summer night.  The chicken souvlaki dinner was delish.  I was watching the food being served at other tables and I wanted all of it.  Will definitely be returning!"}
