{"text":"I felt like the server who was there just profiled me as a younger customer, so she didn't bother asking me what sort of coffee roast I would prefer - but then proceeds to present the options to an older customer who ordered after me. She gave me velouté without offering me the option - had I known I could have gotten the corsé I would have gone for it! Please improve your consistency when serving your customers."}
{"text":"Deficient internet access (they offer it for free but it rarely works and when it does, is intermittent with long delays). Coffee ok. They offer food, mostly pre-prepared."}
{"text":"This is a place in utter decline. Its size is enormous, but at noon, when all cafés surrounding it are buzzing, there were 3 customers in this sad outlet. That should have deterred me but because I was tired of going from café to café to find a space to sit, I dared to order a cappuccino, thinking not much can go wrong with that. It set me back 4 dollars, and it tasted bitter and burnt. The foam on top was not creamy but of this airy, frothy, but not velvety quality that collapses and does add absolutely nothing to the drink. I could not drink it, it was really so bad, and returned it, but that did not prompt a reaction. They put it in a mug, and put a cheap metal spoon in it of a low metal quality that I imagine would be used for prison cutlery.   No coaster, nothing, totally amateurish but at a pro price tag. I was served by a friendly elderly woman, who, judging superficially by looks and accent, reminded me of ladies you encounter serving borschtsch in a soviet cafeteria somewhere on the cold planes of Siberia. The woman was very friendly, and very well meaning, but it seems espresso was not her metier of choice. 

Overall, this place feels desparate, and all the little POS products placed on the counter, totally out of synch with the idea of a café, are testimony to this sad state of affairs.

I cannot recommend this place at all. In all likelihood, it will be closed soon because I fail to understand how the rent for a place like this can be financed with this kind of abysmal dirt brew they serve here."}
{"text":"Always yummy!! a little pricey but its worth it and is reflected in the quality of the food and ambiance. Staff is nice, good setting for a date, studying, hanging out or just a pick up fpr lunch!"}
{"text":"I had a latte which was okay, nothing special. The cheese cakes look like it was there for awhile, a bit of a turn off. I was in the mood for a little sweet with my latte, but based on the look of the sweets.....I decided not to chance it.  :-("}
{"text":"I was very excited to see a new coffee shop open in this location. This place, with a chic modern decor, a corporate colour scheme and an overall sanitized look, is a Montreal-based company that's rapidly expanding to Toronto, Ottawa and Quebec city. So it's another chain; we have Starbucks, Second cup, Tim Hortons and Timothy's in the vicinity. Welcome to the neighbourhood, and hope you can distinguishing yourself.

I went to the cafe three times so far, most recently this morning. There was fresh coffee brewing, something delightful was in the oven baking, and place smelled deliciously aromatic. Clearly, everything was good with the world. I paid $5-ish for my latte and a cookie as the barista was placing delicious muffins, croissants and other evil baked goods on the counter. They have a bunch of breakfast and lunch sandwiches (cheekily named presswiches) as well, which I haven't tried yet. What I have tried is their dark roast (called Big Bang) and unfortunately I didn't find it dark roasty enough, so I'll try again. The price point seems to be on the pricier side and operation runs slick, like a wannabe Starbucks would.

The staff is friendly, good looking, overly enthusiastic and slightly confused, which is to be expected at any new establishment. Few tables and chairs to sit and grab free wifi.

Just one suggestion since this place is new: Provide an option of soya/almond/\"insert another fancy source\" milk for your patrons. It is not cool to not have these options especially if you don't want to leave an impression of being just a pricey Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"I had a simple cappuccino but they spiced it up with some cinnamon which I thought was quite interesting and I loved it! I also had a blueberry supreme muffin which I could tell was fresh. it was simple and just what I needed for breakfast. since it's the summer, they had these huge windows wide open and it felt like you were apart of the outdoors. I highly recommend this café."}
{"text":"I am a regular at this place. Very comfortable place to study and do work while grabbing a bite to eat. Their sandwiches and salads are excellent, but my favorite is their big cookies. I don't eat lunch here too often since it can be pricey, but the soft and chewy cookies are a nice $2 treat. 
(Drinks can be pretty expensive here fyi)

The staff knows me pretty well since I come here a lot. In general, they make a point to talk to people while serving them. I never feel like I'm bothering them when I ask for extra things either."}
{"text":"When the Starbucks on the opposite corner is full, I've started coming here.

They don't offer a refill for filter coffee, which pains me as I'm used to Starbucks policies but I'm happy to have a 2nd cafe option. 

Free Wifi, Comfortable seating & average coffee. 

Prices are similar to Starbucks - A Medium drip coffee is $2.25 (but no refill - not great if you're settling in for a work/study session) 

Pleasant atmosphere with calm music. 

Staff member seemed friendly & pointed out the weekly special offers they have instead of offering refills. 

They do have a loyalty card which you have to get stamped each time you make a purchase. 
6 stamps = 1 free drip coffee. 

Has a fair amout of power outlets for recharging your devices so good for those wanting to work. 

To sum up - I won't be switching from my regular Starbucks but I will be coming here when Starbucks has no available seating (I almost always stay & read/work with my coffee) 

To reiterate - I'm very happy to have a back-up cafe option! 

(This is only my 2nd visit, I may give it higher stars if I become a regular)

My advice - give it a try :)"}
{"text":"Have you ever been at the DMV, waiting to get your license, having to deal with the rude people working there? Have you felt all the hope you had that humanity was somewhat decent slip away from you as you sit there waiting for a number that will never be called? Well, I have, and I would rather have to go to the DMV every day and be yelled at than ever be forced to frequent this sad excuse for a cafe ever again. Because at the DMV, while I'm waiting in line and get up to use the bathroom at the DMV, no one ever goes over to my sister and harasses her and says HEY THAT'S TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE FOR YOU TO USE THE BATHROOM WHILE YOU'RE HERE. At least at the DMV, they don't make you buy stupidly overpriced coffee before you can use the bathroom. We bought this café's dumb bland coffee, and yet the person working the counter felt the need to come over and say it was unacceptable for us to only buy one coffee and have two people use the bathroom. Lmao smh. Not like y'all have much business ever anyway. 

Bad coffee, rude service, bathroom was small and mediocre. Would rather be slapped by a small child than come here again."}
{"text":"Beau grand café au coin Pie-IX et Ontario dans Hochelaga. Personnel sympathique, nourriture abordable et délicieuse."}
{"text":"Ugh. Only stopped in here so we could use the Wifi. Purchased a crappy lemonade and a VERY crappy iced coffee. The lemonade tasted like water with crystal lite. The person who was making my iced coffee looked like he had no idea what he was doing. It tasted like watered down coffee, with 3 sad cubes of ice in it. The worst though is that they charged me $3.99 for the lemonade, even though the sign clearly said $2.60 for the small (I think $3.25 for the large) so I have no idea where they even got 3.99 from, and my iced coffee was also overcharged."}

{"text":"I was excited when this place opened because there are no good breakfast places in this area. 

Rude staff & even worse food. Avoid this place at all costs"}
{"text":"Great little spot where servers are friendly and speak both FR and EN.  

There is a nice mix of business people and student who hang out here.

It's close to shopping, theatre and other restos if you're waiting for a reservation or a flick.

The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is that it is over priced.  Your coffee can't cost more than Starbucks..."}
{"text":"As far as cafes in the McGill Ghetto goes, this joint is alright. The experience varies drastically depending on who serves you. If you're unfortunate enough to encounter the manager/owner, you will be overcharged for coffee ($3 for a mediocre cup) when at all other Presse Cafe's it's $2.75, and even less when they ask you for student ID. Worse yet, the one time I tried to engage in even a modicum of polite small-talk with said owner, he condescendingly responded \"less talk, and we'll all be through this quicker, OK?\". I was absolutely aghast, and didn't return for months.

At the behest of a friend, I finally returned, only to be served by a younger server with chronic ADHD who inspected my drink every 5 minutes ensuring it wasn't empty, so he could give you  the boot (even though the place was dead?)

Understandably, I had incredible reservations to return here again, until I came in the afternoon. The guy serving us was incredibly friendly--charming even--a complete 180 from all my other experiences.

With that said, the amenities at Presse are probably the best in the Ghetto. Super-fast (though sometimes tempermental) WiFi, ample seating, music isn't great but it's also not too loud, and while the people here are generally unremarkable to watch, it makes the place conducive to getting work done.

tl;dr: come here for an afternoon cram-sesh, no more, no less."}
{"text":"Location: On the main. St. Laurent subway is close by and street parking is available. 

The place: Pretty similar to all the other Presse Cafés around town. This one was brightly lit and minimal. The vibe was good - there were a variety of different people there (students, business folk). The only thing I found strange was that the drink fridge was at the other end of the bar/counter - you actually don't even know it's there unless someone tells you (maybe I was just super oblivious yesterday?). My friend and I were ordering drinks and the clerk told us where they were - so that's how we found out it was self-serve. 

The goods: After trekking most of the day taking photos, I was parched. I just grabbed an Aloe water and my friend got a Perrier. Not much to say about either other than I love Aloe juice. 

Service: Good.

Price point: The Aloe water was close to $4 which is a little steep."}
{"text":"Bien situé en face du Cinéplex et du Skyventure, permet de se restaurer avant ou après les activités. Il y a de tout, pas mal de pressdwiches, de la tarte tomate-épinards assez bonne, des salades, de la soupe, des muffins, viennoiseries, scones, etc..
Très bon service, grand espace, grande terrasse"}
{"text":"Quelle désolation... un décor minimal qui n'a rien à voir avec celui de Boucherville et de bien d'autres. Et que dire du 2e étage, un stock room de chaises et de tables, McDo est sexy par rapport à ce resto. Les salades sont dignes d'un hôpital... saveur ordinaire, avec le minimum pour pas déplaire probablement... le chef cuisinier n'en mange jamais... encore moins les proprios... pour être situé dans un des paradis de la restauration à Laval, ce resto n'a pas sa place. Au moins ils réussissent à faire du café savoureux. Une GROSSE étoile pour cet opérateur qui en mérite qu'une seule des cinq pointes de l'étoile..."}
{"text":"Yeah, don't go here. Actually, avoid this one and also the one on Milton, I've gotten bad service at both. 
Lately they've been putting up a sign that says \"Free filtered coffee, courtesy of our new administration!\". It's freezing outside, so why not? I walk in and the cashier isn't aware of this new promotion: he goes to see the manager, who looks at me like I just spat in her drink. I eventually get my coffee, and yes it's free. However, the manager walks up to the cash register, muttering \"What you're doing is not okay\" in French. 

Thanks for the great promotion, friendly new administration of Presse Café. 

The coffee wasn't good anyway. It tasted acidic, with a little hint of dishsoap."}
{"text":"I quite liked the sandwich and soup that I got, the man who served me was quite nice (gave me a taste of the soup before I decided to order), and it was relatively inexpensive! There are plenty of seats and electrical outlets, and the WiFi was reliable, so I'd imagine it'd make a good studying space (I've yet to try the coffee, however)."}
{"text":"Their salad is absolutely amazing and their pastries are to die for! Love it!"}
{"text":"This cafe is absolutely awful. I had just arrived in Montreal to move into college when I ordered a hot tea with my mother and brother. We decided to start with a tea so we could take a moment to look at the menu and after the long trip we needed to use the restroom and look for directions. There was only one person in the relatively large space with plenty of seating. When my mother and brother were in the restroom, the woman working, likely the owner, came over and attempted to intimidate me by invading my personal space and whispering in my ear \"You asian bitch. Dont come here just to use my wifi and restroom.\" And I saw her spit in my tea when she practically shoved it to me."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. Their food is decent especially if you're just looking for a sandwich and coffee on the go. 

Today I came to do some work and both their wifi networks were not working. My chicken and avocado wrap also had no avocado. Probably wouldn't come again unless I want to grab a breakfast special."}
{"text":"I came in here for coffee and immediately if not somewhat rudely got told that the \"coffee machine isn't working\"... so no espressos, no lattes, no cappuccinos... at a cafe place....alright... Only option available was their filtered coffees in those containers that look like those you see for Van Houtte at smaller cafes/gas stations. Anyways, I opted for the coarse coffee in a medium size only to find out it's $4 when I'm paying for it?? How is this even competitive? McD's less than half the price.. but did it taste better? Nope. The coffee wasn't very coarse at all and tasted kind-off mediocre.. I had to throw the remaining 1/3 of my coffee once it got cold at work. This rarely happens.

What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Situated at a prime tourist location along the summer pedestrian street with pink hanging ball decor, I was pretty surprised that the people behind the coffee bar, the manager, i believe, spoke very little english and really took his sweet time.
On top of that - I think that I was overcharged for an iced americano. For one shot of unfancy expresso, $3.50 is definitely steep. Even the best espresso I've had does not go over $3.
Enough said. There are much better places where you can get a sexy cup of java."}
{"text":"These reviews make me sad. I've been here quite a few times and honestly I like the drinks a lot more than the ones at Milton B across the street. Granted, I've only had the ice coffee and the iced mocha (I love the iced mocha!! They blend the ice into it so it's more of a mocha slushie but I like that). The place is enormous. Contrary to the other (dated) reviews, it's not that empty, but there will almost always be seats. The service I received was just fine every time I've gone. Note that the inside area can get a little stuffy (I think it has poor air circulation). I've also had the chicken (I think it was chipotle?) sandwich and it was actually really good! 

I think this cafe is a good study space, especially if you will be here for several hours. Sit in the big area near the entrance though for better air."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place on Tuesday before going to a movie at the Carlton.
I'll just say that it's simply different from the Starbucks down the block, and I would come here as an alternative if I didn't want to hang out at the \"other\" coffee shop.
The selection of sandwiches and salads did seem to be murmuring \"fresh and healthy\" at me and I decided to try one out. I had a Turkey and Sundried tomato wrap, which was alright but I think re-warming it makes the tortilla turn out slight soggy. I also had one of the featured beverages, the Toasted Marshmallow Latte was sweet enough and alright. 
I do like how the inside was warmly decorated with Christmas items and the splash of red on the high tables seems to go well with the festive season."}
{"text":"This place was completely empty, so we chose to work here. They have free wifi and very comfortable seating.
I ordered a toasted marshmellow latte (approx $4). It was not too sweet which was perfect.

A very spacious cafe. Originally from Montreal I'm guessing? It seemed like there was only one staff member running the entire shop, but he was a very friendly young man.

Tip: They have a discount for students!"}
{"text":"J' ai eu droit au fond du thermos ou le café est gardé après l' infusion.
Je vais a cet endroit pour justement le café frais.
Je n' ai pas eu droit a un bonjour ni un sourire de la préposée au comptoir.
Restaurant a besoin d' être rafraîchi a l' intérieur.
Stationnement facile."}
{"text":"Free Internet, and the unofficial meeting spot Monday nights for keeners that do \"after-work-hours\" work called Get Sh*t Done Mondays or GSD Mondays. First time I came here, I got a tea, and was amazed at the size of this place.  It practically begs you to freeload on internet, with its ample seating (they have a table that seats 16 comfortably, and just tons of space all around, not to mention plugs galore.) 

Sadly though, the tea I had was horrendous, I don't know why? I ordered an earl grey, I put the bag in myself, and it tasted dirt-like. BUT having said that, I got a V-8 the next time, and it was fine. They do serve food, and they also have some crazy looking desserts. Im certain all McGill Kids know about this place, but I was and still am fascinated by this 16 person table in the same way that I was intrigued by a 16man tent. Mind Blowing"}
{"text":"Very unclean place with very unclean toilets. Poor service. Rude owner and rude service."}
{"text":"They hit a new low.....they give fake passwords for the WiFi. If they cannot offer it or do not want people to use it then they be honest and remove the free WiFi sign"}
{"text":"Ce n'est pas pour rien qu'il a fermé!

L'ambiance était mauvaise, le café était mauvais et le service était absent!"}
{"text":"This is a review for the spacious seating, free wifi, and the glorious mojito (virgin) that we shared there today. I though I had asked for the slushy mojito that was advertised on a door sing outside, but it turns out they make one alcohol-free with Perrier. Super and very minty! We will go back and order another if we pass by...forget the slushy!

Internet was super fast and the two rooms gave you plenty of room to sit and think in peace."}
{"text":"C'est la première fois que je viens ici et c'est très certainement la dernière. 
J'ai vécu une expérience café désagréable. Employés pas très cordiales, froids et secs. Le mur Est et Nord sont des vitres du plafond au sol beaucoup de luminosité mais il fait beaucoup trop chaud et il n'y a pas d'air climatisé. Aujourd'hui il fait environ 12 degrés sur Mtl...j'ose même pas imaginer la situation en plein été. J'me suis quand même laissé tenter par un combo Sandwich et choix de salade. Ben j'ai même pas terminé la moitié de mon plat. La salade de patate était sans goût et celle de couscous trop épicé. 

Bref je déteste faire ma mauvaise langue même ici et même si je sais que mon avis aidera peux-être quel qu'un mais la c'est ben le bout du bout.

AHHHHH me vider le cur m'a fait du bien.

{"text":"Nice little coffee shop on 2 floors for seating. I was served in English without any problem. Nice decorations up for the Christmas holidays.

Large green tea is pricier than at Second Cup but it is still not bad a 3$ and some change. 

The wi-fi is decent and there are a few electrical outlets to plug in your laptop. Seems they don't really monitor how much you time you spend surfing when it's not too busy. Open until midnight, the latest in Laval I know of (others close at 10 pm or 11 pm)."}
{"text":"I only had a coffee here. Didn't have time to eat. So I can't really review the food (although it did look fantastic). The staff weren't too friendly and seemed a bit abrupt but hey, give me my coffee and no one gets hurt..."}
{"text":"I have been to this place quite a few times because it's super close to where I live. This place is nice and quiet. They have got some nice seatings, free wifi and a pretty catchy playlist. Not a bad spot for evening chat after work as they usually closes at 8pm on weekday. Friendly owner and staffs as well. 

This is a chain cafe (originally form Montreal), thou, I'm not disappointed with their drinks and food! They have some pretty delicious things on menu. The eggpress was my favourite. It got vegetable omelet, lettuce, cheese, and tomato inside. A perfect vegetarian sandwich! The omelet was very delicious, it literally melted in my mouth. The bread also had a lot of herbs on, it smell amazing after they toasted it. A must tried at the cafe. 

My second favourite thing from the cafe would probably be the big cookie . Trust me, this evil baked goodie can be addictive. But it's another must try as well if you like baked goods. I grab one of those every time I go to the cafe. 

For beverages, I cannot say too much about their coffee, because I'm not a coffee lover. But this cafe offers freshly made smoothie! They have fruity smoothie, and some vegetables based smoothie. So fresh and healthy! 

Overall, a nice place for breakfast and lunch if you work nearby. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Large place. Can be overloaded by students from McGill. Drinks are fine. Food is okay... Better than the 2 other places on this corner. 

Wireless network is quite unreliable and fails quite often. If you have to work on the network this place is not good but fine for offline."}

{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews but sometimes it must be done. We wandered in looking for a quick hot beverage and we were hoping for good drinks and good service. Sadly, we got neither. My 13 year old asked if they had vanilla frappes and the woman behind the counter said in her most rude tone, \"This isn't Starbucks.\" Ok, I get that but couldn't she have said, \"No, but this is what we do have\"? My daughter felt humiliated. Great job. My son had already ordered a hot chocolate and I should have trusted my instincts and canceled and left, rather, my daughter asked for a hot chocolate and I ordered a chai latte. The hot chocolate was basically brown water with no flavor and I honestly don't know what my chai was. It wasn't chai. The facility was a mess and she even began mopping right where we stood. Awful. Get better staff. If you are miserable, try not to pass it along to your customers. Stay away. Far away."}
{"text":"Nouveau \"Presse Café\", ouvert depuis la fin de semaine du Grand Prix (début juin 2014) sur Saint-Laurent, entre Prince-Arthur et Sherbrooke très bien décoré/design. De plus, il y beaucoup de place pour travailler ainsi que quelques fauteuils dans le fond pour relaxer. Le menu est le même que les autres Presse Café, le personnel était sympa et souriant, le wifi est gratuit gracieuseté de \" LaPresse+\" par contre le débit est lent à mon goût. À revoir... L'endroit est très propre et les toilettes aussi, c'est rare dans le quartier....Toutes les fois, où j'y suis allé, il n'y avait personne comme si les gens ne connaissait pas ou ne voulait pas s'arrêter, c'est quand même bizarre.

Bien que généralement je préfère aller dans des cafés indépendants et uniques en leur genre, j'aime quand même aller faire un tour au Presse Café.

J'affectionne celui-ci en particulier pour 3 raisons: la nourriture est délicieuse (les wraps, sandwichs, salades et quiches sont tous délicieux), le wifi fonctionne super bien, sans interruptions, puis, en été les grandes fenêtres s'ouvrent pour donner l'impression d'être sur une terrasse. Un petit bonus: ils ont souvent des bons magasines à lire - surtout pour les filles comme moi qui aiment les magasines de potins, décoration et bouffe!"}
{"text":"Very hot coffee with wifi and plentiful power outlets. It was exactly what I needed to recharge my phone and write a Yelp review or two while I sipped away at the coffee. Sure, there are pastries and sandwiches, but coffee was what I needed today.

{"text":"Stumbled into this cafe while wondering Montreal late at night looking for something to eat. It seems to be a fairly common chain there, but when we went inside we got quite a mom-and-pop feel. The man behind the counter was very nice, and realized quickly that we were looking for vegetarian/vegan food and was eager to accommodate us. He let us sample a very nice homemade vegetable soup, which we ordered along with a panini. It also came with two little salads. The service and food were overall very good."}

{"text":"I went mid-day for a coffee, lunch and to do some work while killing time waiting for a nearby appointment. The cafe is NOISY although, not because of the foot traffic, but the actual machinery (toaster for sandwiches, every door, every chair) was NOISY and constant.. very distracting. The WIFI name isn't \"Presse Cafe\" as you would expect but instead is Rogers-338519372 or something obscure like that and was SHITTY. The wifi would connect and I could open incoming emails but nothing would load in terms of graphics or video. Limited seating near outlets - I would not go there to get work done.
One of the staff members was playing with her hair (putting up, taking it out, putting it up again) behind the counter near the food and the girl at the cash register was cold and a little rude when I was unclear on whether I should order at the deli counter or pay first.
Coffee was MEH, no non-dairy options for milk."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time just to get an espresso when I lived in the neighborhood. Like, almost every day, since I lived so close. 
BUT THEN ONE DAY (after I'd moved further away) I went in because I was trying to meet up with a friend and my phone doesn't have data, so I was hoping to just pop in to use the wifi. I was fine with buying something if I needed to, but if I could get away with not buying anything, that would've been great (but again, not necessary. Very fine with buying something.) 
I was looking at my phone to see if it connected to the wifi automatically (since I'd connected to it ages ago). It hadn't, so I glanced up to the little plaque where I knew they kept the wifi. 
As I did that, the young guy behind the counter came over, made eye contact with me, then flipped the wifi plaque down so I couldn't read it. 
I was super baffled. Upon him coming over, I was planning on ordering something just to be polite. But he did that so quickly that I didn't even have a chance to start a dialogue. After a few seconds of looking at the drink menu and laughing uncomfortably, I changed my mind. \"You know what? No. I'm not ordering anything from you,\" I said. Because that was such a power trip he played. If I ordered something, I would have then had to then ask him for the wifi. And I'm done with mediocre white men acting like they have power over me. It would have taken him literally zero effort to make my day a tiny bit easier. 
So, if you're the kinda short generic looking young guy who works at the Presse on Saint Catherine, just know you're kindof a jerk and should rethink how you instinctively treat people. 

Also Presse is a mediocre chain. Go somewhere else for coffee and paninis."}
