{"text":"HORRIBLE over fried unrecognizable meat in hard batter. Rice is reheated."}
{"text":"Gross!! I stopped by on my way to work. I order sesame chicken with shrimp fried rice and it was AWFUL!! The chicken was extremely crispy. The rice was flavorless. I didn't bite the egg roll. I didn't finish my food. I threw the entire box away. And not to mention they have terrible customer service"}
{"text":"Deceptive business practices. 6 pieces of chicken is actually only 3 wings. I asked to see the food before the lady hurriedly closed the box. When I asked about it she turned evil & said \"we give you big chicken so you get 3 wing\". So I went to count the chicken & she said \"don't touch it if you no want it.\" I told her I had already paid for it so she threw it in the bag with no sauces, napkins, or a fork. I had to ask for sauces.   Anyway, the chicken wings are like teradactly wings or something. They're huge. The food is pretty good. No complaints there. So far I've had the shrimp & broccoli, chicken wings, & shrimp fried rice. I'm not going to try everything on the menu but I did enjoy what I've had so far.  Just do yourself a favor. Don't ask questions & if you do, prepare for the wrath of the smiling not so nice lady at the counter. You have been warned."}
{"text":"I wouldn't eat here if it were the last food place in Charlotte. They have burnt broccoli. They also have a lack of good customer service. Oh not to mention how slow they are when you are waiting for your order. Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"The food is good, and the courteous, hospitable lady who processed my order was a pleasant addition to the meal."}
{"text":"I hate to be negative. But not good at all. The worse I have had in a long time. The chicken had some weird batter on it, the egg foo young gravy was off tasting, and I'm not sure what type of meat was in the wontons. Just trying to be helpful"}
