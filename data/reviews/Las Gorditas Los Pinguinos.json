{"text":"Located on Rainbow and Smoke Ranch, this place turned out to be good!As I walked in, it kind of reminded me of Roberto's because it has the Salsa bar. Of course only women work there because it is called Las Gorditas, I don't speak Spanish but I know anything ending in AS is lady or girl (I think).  When I looked at the menu and looked at the prices my eyes got wider, everything on the menu is less then $6 bucks. So if your on a budget you can get a gordita for only $2.45 which is kind of like a small taco with a pocket.  So far I have tried the carne asada burrito which is pretty good which has rice, beans, and meat. The meat was cooked perfect, not too salty and not too greasy. I also tried their Gorditas which is pretty good, you can make it a combo if you want which you can either pick 2 or 3 Gorditas that comes with a side of rice and beans. They also serve different flavors of shaved ice, smoothies, and fresh squeezed juice!"}
{"text":"A clean casual mexican restaurant with tasty food and reasonable prices.  Never had a fresh Gordita before.  Frankly, thought it was some freakish Taco Hell creation.  While I can't comment on authenticity, the green chili chicken gordita with cheese was wonderful.  The freshly made corn tortilla was the best part.  Salsa bar is good, not great, but love the cabbage and pickled onions.  Also had a good carne asada gordita.  Great eats before a movie."}
{"text":"I just recently found this place on Rainbow near Smoke ranch. This is my 3rd time here the food is decent enough to eat here when I don't feel like driving too far for real good Mexican food. The raspados ( crushed ice with a syrup flavoring ) are the best I've had here by far. The down side to this place is that they don't have a variety of meat options for tacos. And the wait was the worse. Im a pretty patient person but I swear the wait for fast food tacos was over 20 minutes and the place wasn't packed at all."}
{"text":"I had both a red tinga as well as a chili verde gordita. I also enjoyed a large cup of the best Horchata in Las Vegas. Fresh and warm, the gorditas were filling and good.....but not great. Good for a quick stop, but there are much better options when looking for a full flavored, spicy, authentic gordita. The service was very friendly and the restaurant spotlessly clean, almost antiseptic."}
{"text":"The raspados are AMAZING! I could seriously substitute all my meals for a raspado."}
{"text":"Great food, great flavor just the salsas need to improve a lot"}
