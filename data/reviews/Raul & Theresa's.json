{"text":"Went to the original location and was not impressed. We asked for a mild salsa and were given a bowl of tomato juice. Not a single piece of solid food in it. The carnitas were really dry.
The beef and shrimp fajitas were very tasty. I was served a huge mound of sizzling food and almost all of it was onions and peppers. Fortunately I like onions and peppers but the meat shrimp were nowhere to be found. I didn't hate it but I wouldn't go back. There are many better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh, the salsa is always perfect, and the service is friendly. The restaurant seems to need a little bit of updating by way of their tables. If you're in the mood for Mexican food this is the place to come!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Service is impeccable. Our waitress Gloria never forgets her customers.  She knows what and how you love your dinner. We always do a call a head and our table is waiting for us. Micheal and Lisa take great pride in their business and the food proves it."}
{"text":"To say it best. Find a different restaurant. My self and 2 associates ordered the Fajiitas. 
The meat had no taste. The flour tortilla's were crispy hard. I could go on with the other food, but I won't bore you. 

The service ,the waitress, English was very limited. We asked specifically if the rice was prepared with chicken broth. Our associate is a vegetarian. The waitress answered twice, no it is not made with chicken broth. My associate did not believe her and went and asked the cook. It was made with chicken broth.  Later She dropped a plate of rice and beans and did not return to clean it up. We cleaned it up. 
We paid the bill. She walked the tip back to us and proceeded to count  back to the bill payer?? No manager on duty. Adios."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is still in business. When I prefer taco bell over a Mexican restaurant, that's bad. The enchilada sauce tastes (and I suspect it is) like canned enchilada sauce from the grocery store that I use to make enchiladas at home. Unacceptable.  Their spicy food has way too much spice without the flavor. I love spicy hot food but flavor is what makes the spiciness good. The service is fine but my goodness...you're a restaurant! If I wanted amateur Mexican food which requires store bought canned goods, I will buy it myself and make it at home. Period. This restaurant was definitely a waste of money and I didn't even finish my food it was so bad."}
{"text":"Great food. Fast service.  Spicy salsa.  If you tired of chain mexican food places you'll love the this restaurant."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner tonight.  The service, while friendly, was slow. They did have a large party so that could have slowed things down some.  The food was just mediocre.  We ordered the cheese dip appetizer for $5.00.  It was just gas station canned cheese with green onion stirred in.  By looking at the bowl it came in you could tell it was warmed up in a microwave.  My husband and I each ordered the shredded beef chimichangas.  The rice tasted good, but the top of the rice was dry and crusty, like it was held in a warming oven for a good long while.  The shredded beef was tasty.  We probably wouldn't come back again, not unless we were with others who really wanted to eat there."}
{"text":"Went to dinner at the restaurant Wednesday night food was good , beer was cold and service was excellent ."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food we've eaten.  Love the special on Wednesday - all you can eat shredded beef tacos & cheese enchiladas for $9.99."}
{"text":"When R&T added this location a few years ago I was excited about it. I had heard good things about the original location so I was looking forward to authentic home style Mexican food. I have eaten there a number of times since & each time leave disappointed. We stopped in for lunch & I ordered the mini machaca burro combo. The meat was good but the seasonings were odd. Sweet peppers and green onions were fine but there was no kick at all & I think it had some cumin which seemed odd in this dish. The chips weren't very fresh although I do like their salsa. Beans & rice were good. I especially like their rice.

It's not bad, but not great either. Cheese enchiladas are usually very good but I haven't had any in a while. 

Portions are large like most Mexican food places so it's a good choice if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant food is great and always consistent, real authentic Mexican food, service is always friendly and cheerful, they can get very busy at times but work hard to get you seated and served."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  I used to eat at the original R&T's in Goodyear back in the mid '90's.  I was in town visiting & saw the new location in Litchfield Park.  I stopped, mid-afternoon for a margarita & some nachos.  Pretty basic, right?  Well, no frozen margaritas today, because the blender's broken... instead, I get a margarita on the rocks served in a 10oz water glass!?!?  Huh?  When the nachos finally arrive, I'm speechless... I think maybe the cook had the busboy heap some chips on a plate, sprinkle some shredded cheese on the chips, & then throw the plate into the microwave for about 2-3 min too long!  There was hardly a drop of \"melted\" cheese left!  I was reminded of the burnt cheese in a Copper Pro cookware TV commercial. The whole mess was welded together with a dark orange, hard cheese coating with fresh jalape√±os sprinkled on top!!  By the way, if you do decide to eat here, do not look at the floor behind the counter by the cash register!  I won't be going back!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place. They food is amazing and the staff is always great. Not sure why they have one star reviews. All my friends and family eat here it's great"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! I ordered #27 with green chili and it was horrible.  We left full plates of food and the waitress didn't even ask why we were leaving it.  The restaurant was dirty and we left feeling itchy."}
{"text":"OMG! The place was filthy! \"A\" rating in the window. Food was decent, but the windows and front door were gross. The women's bathroom? I held it until I got home. Never, Never, Never going back!"}
{"text":"Nothing authentic about this place. Some of the blandest Mexican food I've ever had. Mild salsa tastes like tomato paste, fajitas were more like stir fry, chimichanga just had shredded chicken with no spices or flavor, but guacamole was good."}
{"text":"I was in the area and hungry, and since I am always in the mood for Mexican I decided to give the place with the \"Now Open\" sign a try. The space is very clean, which is always a good sign, and the staff was very friendly. It was lunch time, and I just wanted to order some food to go and head back to my office. The hostess suggested the lunch special of a cheese enchilada, beef taco and rice/beans for $5.95, that sounded good to me, and the price was right so I went for it. 

I waited about 10 minutes for the food to be ready, and then hopped in my car for the 20 minute drive back to my office. I was starving so I grabbed a chip, well, they were warm, but they were chewy! Chewy chips mean they were not cooked long enough.....so disappointing! 

Once I got to my office I pulled out my food.....I have to say it was the weirdest presentation ever. They had taken a thick paper plate, covered it in foil then put my food on it and covered the whole thing in plastic wrap. Wouldn't if have been easier, and probably even cheaper to just buy To Go boxes (like the ones I saw customers taking home their leftovers in)? The food had shifted a bit in the car ride, and the enchilada sauce was beginning to seep out the sides.....it was not pretty. Also, what if i didn't eat it all? The plastic wrap had to be ripped off and wasn't going to cover it up again! 

The enchilada was all right, nothing special, the sauce was really mild, so good for those who don't like too much spice. The meat in the taco was pretty good, and they didn't skimp on it. My barometer of a good Mexican restaurant, the beans, hovered just at mid range, they were decent, but not crave-able. 

I wouldn't make a special trip back here, but if I was in the area I might give them another chance....but I will opt to eat in the restaurant instead!"}
{"text":"Excellent place Big portions clean restaurant awesome food reminds me of my ninas cooking definetly bring back  my family gotta try it"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Food is always great, servers are always nice.  Been here at least 4 times and have had consistent service."}
{"text":"If I could give half a star I would. Don't bother going here. Go to Chilis or Cracker Barrel your tummy will be better off.  Second try here . 
Starting with service we felt like we were interrupting a very important conversation. Even though they saw us. We sat ourselves. Cleanliness & food below par.
The beef taquitos were good."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with three coworkers. We were all in uniform  (military).  The waitstaff  wasn't the greatest. The food was really good despite the lackluster service. Another customer walked up to thank us for our service and informed us that he took care of our check. Overall not a bad place to eat."}
{"text":"Prices are Great, food just like my Nana's cooking.  Tamales are delicious and not heavy feeling, cheese enchiladas were great big portions.  Hot salsa wasn't hot but I'll go back."}
{"text":"Wednesday nights all you can eat cheese enchiladas and shredded beef tacos !! The BOMB !!!! Service was excellent , staff was friendly , prompt, and very hospitable . Our server Anthony treated us like family , and was very kind and polite .  
We will be visiting this family run business again! ( probably on a Wednesday )"}
{"text":"Some of the best mexican food I've ever eaten. They've been in business since 1969 (at the old location), stop by and find out why.  Lunch fajitas are delicious and a great deal to boot."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had a bad experience with the service or the food. We've dined at this new location several times as well as the original location on MC85. I don't understand the bad reviews. We are always greeted with a smile and a big basket of chips with a bowl of salsa. If the chips run out before our meal arrives, they promptly bring out more. My husband is also a huge fan of this place and so are our kids. They enjoy a bowl of menudo while I like the enchiladas. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Good food.  Very informal atmosphere.  Nothing special, but nothing bad about it either.  If you are looking for good Mexican food and a relaxed open environment, this is the place."}
{"text":"This restaurant came highly recommended, but there was nothing remarkable out it. The interior is the now overdone industrial design with exposed air ducts and lots of sheet metal.

The food was very basic and the prices not all that attractive to make me want to return. The chips were unsalted and stale. The salsa was hot and spicy, but with not alternative offered, went untouched by most in our party.

Hours after eating, 3 of the 4 of us complained of stomach pains and other intestinal distress. Maybe just a coincidence.

There's much better Mexican out there. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Must try the chicken tacos! I love their tacos. Service is always HIT or MISS but for the most part the food helps that."}
{"text":"The best street tacos around. Wednesday special is All You Can Eat for $10.99.  It includes    3 enchiladas and 3 tacos on the first round. The chips and salsa are very good too. Nice and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Was a little disappointed in the food. The chips were stale, menudo was bland and the tortillas were dry. Will not dine there again."}
{"text":"Not bad, not memorable either, average. Carne Asada burrito had about 2-3 oz of meat. Very odd decor. I believe they took over another restaurant location and moved in as is. Kind of like a school cafeteria feel."}
{"text":"I was ecstatic when they opened this place so I went and ordered a combination plate consisting of enchilada, taco, beans and rice. I was very disappointed with this dish. My beans were very runny and bland. Everything else was just bearable to get down. I'm sad that this place didn't meet my expectations but I will not be returning there."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place...and the food was awful. Arrived at 5pm and there were only 2 tables taken (Should have been our first red flag) and it still took over 30 minutes to get our food. The staff was more interested in talking about where they were going after work than taking care of the customers. We will NEVER be back again..."}
{"text":"Great good and service. I recommend it if you're looking for authentic Mexican food. Family owned and operated."}
{"text":"Service was slow.  I ordered my dinner without beans.  Came with beans.  Asked for a new plate sans beans. They brought my plate and I started eating and found beans under everything.  Mentioned it at check out and she just apologized and did nothing to make it right.  First and last time I'll eat there. ."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Raul & Theresa's for a few years.  We ate at the old one before so we just followed the people to the new one even though it is a different owner.  The food is reasonable priced and very tasty.  The customer service is exceptional especially at lunch when we are usually there."}
{"text":"First time here (out of towner) and was not disappointed. Fast service, amazing waitress & was VERY impressed with my order (chimichanga dinner). I'm very picky with rice & beans & was happily surprised!!"}
{"text":"I am from Nebraska and love Menudo and I was not disappointed with the menudo I ate and the flour tortillas were very fresh and warm. Would highly recommend if your looking for menudo."}
{"text":"WORST food and experience ever.  I was out with my Mom in December and we decided to try something new and local for a fun lunch experience.   Totally regret it and wish we hadn't wasted a \"special lunch\" in this place.  Service was horrific.  The water tasted awful.  Finally asked for a bottle of water and was charged $2.00.  Ordered chicken fajitas.  The chicken didn't taste right...It was chewy/rubbery.   I didn't eat it and they didn't care if I liked it or not.  I had to ask for sour cream and they seemed surprised that I thought sour cream should be included (it was simply salsa and chicken and cold tortillas).  Generally fajitas would have some type of garnish.  Never refilled chips or the salsa served in Styrofoam cups despite walking by many times.   The employees seemed more interested in visiting and flirting with each other at a table of their own.  I could go on and on... but needless to say I will never go back and would advise no one else to go there.  Save your money.... Especially don't buy the margaritas... unless of course you enjoy ice with mix and no tequila!"}
{"text":"I wanted Mexican Food, took my wife... Menu is deceiving with them pictures for the orders. Well, we get there... get seated , no hello's , any water and wait for 10 minutes.... Boy ! I had a funny feeling thas was a BAD Place to eat.... then we got some chips , then the water and got our orders taken. Hmm good 25 minutes waiting. 

Well, like always try to be polite and wait to see if the food is good like the pictures on the menu..... Nope, the food tasted like old cooking oil the Rice very dry, the Tacos soggy the beans where kinda burnt. I told my wife can I taste your dish ... I was no way it taste the same cooking oil ... I left my food , did not finish it ... I'm sorry , this is not Mexican Food. I should of eaten at home and save my money ....  it should be a  Minus 2 Star. Never coming Back....."}
{"text":"Will never eat her again, the food was not good. The rice was horrible, it takes more than tomatoe sauce to call it Spanish rice! The enchilada was not good. I had the chili relleno, and I've had way better. It was more like an omelette with green chilli. Not authentic Mexican food. Definatly won't come back!"}
{"text":"Food is terrible! Literally everything they brought out was canned or frozen. Absolutely nothing made fresh. Even the chips looked like they pulled it out of the bag and heated it in the microwave. Paid $11.25 for a meal I could have eaten at a school cafeteria. Also the service was not very friendly. I had to keep telling my waiter what I wanted because he kept cutting me off trying to get my bf's order so he could get us out of there. We ate our 1 tacos, left the rest of the food on the plate, and went somewhere else. If you're going to serve canned cafeteria food, at least price it accordingly."}
{"text":"wow!  after reading the other lackluster reviews I had to wonder if we ate at the same place!  I used to eat at the original Raul & Theresa's when I lived in the valley back in the 80s.  My hubby and I happened to notice this one on Litchfield and decided to give it a try.  We were VERY impressed with EVERYTHING!  The salsa was very fresh and really tasty.  Our server was excellent!  He brought us a small bowl of the Theresa's special and their green chile to try.  The meat in both, was so incredibly tender that it just fell apart when we tried to pick it up with a fork and both were VERY flavorful.  i opted for a combo that included an enchilada and a green chile burro and was NOT disappointed.  The spanish rice was delish.  My husband had a combo that included 2 cheese enchiladas, a beef tamale, and a taco.  The taco wasn't fantastic but it wasn't bad either.  The beef tamale was great, though.  The beef had a great taste to it and there was plenty of it (unlike a tamale he'd had before at another mexican food restaurant where he had to \"hunt\" for signs of meet inside the tamale).  The waiter had mentioned that he had a \"surprise\" for my husband.  I figured that meant he was going to give him a little sample of their desserts or something like he had with their entrees but what he'd done is replace one of the cheese enchiladas with a green chile enchilada because my husband expressed how delicious it was.  Talk about going above and beyond!  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I had never tried the menudo rojo before but did and have gone back once a week since the beginning of the year. Love this place!
First found it when we moved here last year. Ordered the hat salad. Eat there regularly now. Service is great and I heartily recommend it for regular eating especially for seniors."}
{"text":"Down here on business and I always check Yelp for the places that are best to eat at. This restaurant had somewhat mixed reviews but worth a shot. So glad I did!!  Great food, fantastic service and very reasonable prices. I'll definitely be stopping here on my next visit!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the food @ this location way better than on MC 85 location. Had the all you can eat tacos n enchiladas it was very tasty red chile sauce and tacos were deep fried for $10 on Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"If you are a traveler and working in the west valley, it is late and you don't want to commute then try this place out.  Phoenix is interesting when eating mexican.  You tend to get more of the Sonoran influence which is basically american mexican food which tends to be heavy with sour cream and yellow cheeses.  

This place used to be an ichi ban and you will notice the left over teppan tables as you walk in.  The food is good they have a good assortment of your usual enchiladas and burritos. 

They have plenty of beer selections and some margaritas. The service was very good and that will definitely suffice for the three stars."}
{"text":"I have been a long time lurker of yelp and it's sad that I break my lurking not with an extraordinary dining experience, but a very lackluster one.  This place is probably the worst mexican food I've had at a restaurant.  

I grew up in southern CA  and am married to a Mexican wife that is an excellent cook, so I feel confident that I have been exposed to really good Mexican food and this place is the furthest thing from it.  It may sound like I am being harsh, but when the restaurant has signs that say \"Authentic Mexican Food\" and \"Arizona's finest Mexican Food since 1968\" it does raise some level of expectation.  

I'm not sure how they can claim any level of authenticity when there's no aguas frescas, the cheese they use for enchiladas is cheddar instead of queso fresco, and  most of the menu resembled stuff you could get from taco bell (no mole, no chilaquiles, no chile colorado).  Even if it was \"Americanized\" I would be fine with it if the food tasted good, but the rice was burnt, the beans were overly greasy and the burrito had the flavor of a Costco frozen burrito.  My wife had the plate with a taco, a flauta, and an enchilada and thatt was worse than mine.

The only thing worse than being let down with bad food, is waiting a long time for bad food, which is what happened to us."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant ever! I've told many people about it and it's all their favorites now as well. My fianc√© and I come here all the time and it's always excellent!

The complimentary chips and salsa are amazing. There is a hot and a mild salsa. Both are delicious depending on your preference. 

Service is always fast and friendly! I've never had any problems here. 

I always get the cheese enchiladas and they are SO good. I love them! They've got to be the best ones I've ever had anywhere. The food always comes out nice and hot. 

The prices are good. Every time I go it's around $30 for 2. The restaurant is where you have a receipt and pay at the front.

The only con I can say is the decor is pretty basic and some of the tables are wobbly. So maybe spruce up the interior and fix or get newer tables. The foods great though. And that's all that matters. So I still give it a 5 star!

I will continue to come here and tell people how great it is :)"}
{"text":"This place is A-OK!  I don't think it is as good as the Raul & Theresa's that is south of I-10 but it's decent.  I definitely think it's better than some of the other Mexican food establishments in the area.  Our point of reference would be we are more Tex-Mex kind of folks.  It's not really Tex-Mex at R&T but close enough.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"I was instantly enamored with Raul and Theresa's, texting my bf that I'd found our go-to mexican food place, and during the chips and salsa and guacamole I was right. I wish their mild salsa had a little more texture to it, but the hot salsa flavor was FANTASTIC.  They were very patient with my order because my son is allergic to wheat and dairy so I was very adament about no cheese or flour tortillas.  They kindly accomidated our special requests.  I ordered the carne asada burrito and I couldn't wait to get it but it was a little lackluster on flavor.  I will be back, I didn't order off of their specialties part of the menu so I will be back to see what they think is the best of their food.  The waitress I had was lovely, my only feedback is that she didn't anticipate any needs, like ask if I wanted another margarita, or more guacamole or anything like that. She easily could have sold me on quite a few more items. 

Very clean, very modern setup but not too fancy.  No complaints on the ambiance.  Our waitress took our check."}
{"text":"Honestly the worst Mexican food I've ever eaten and on top of that the service sucked.  The chips were taco bell quality, beans were from a can, fajitas were so bland that I had to pour salsa all over them to even half way choke it down.

They sure are terrible for a Mexican restaurant run by Mexican folks that claims to be \"Arizona's Finest\".

I rarely write bad reviews and always leave a generous tip, but this time around I only left 10% which says a lot for me.  Don't eat here you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were great! The margaritas were decent and the food was yummy! This is probably the closest to authentic that we've gotten since we got down to Arizona."}
{"text":"My husband and I meet up with 4 other friends when we come through Arizona. We picked this  spot based on location, Margaritas and we all love Mexican food. From the outside it looks like an authentic Mexican restaurant, but when we stepped inside, we thought we were at a Chucky Cheese. The place was crawling with kids, and was really loud and junky looking. None the less, we sat down and finally got our drinks. We ordered a variety of food so we could all just kinda share. The waitress acted like she was doing us a favor by even taking our order. We finally got our very watered down margaritas and our disgusting appetizers. My husband and I switched to beer so we at least knew we were getting some alcohol. Nobody ever came by to take our plates when we were done. I mean ever. They must have cleared the table after they kicked us out. Yes that's right, we got kicked out. The place advertises that it is open until 10:00 pm. They started putting chairs up on the empty tables at about 8:30 and by 9:15 they actually shut the lights out on us. We were not being loud or obnoxious or doing anything wrong, they just wanted to get us out of there for whatever reason. So we continued to drink in the dark and have our fun, but by 9:30 we realized we weren't going to get any more drinks, so we decided to leave. So I guess technically we weren't kicked out, but when a restaurant turns the lights out on you, it's a pretty big hint to get the F out! We would never ever eat there again, but the way we were treated was comical and gave us material to laugh about for years to come. So for that one reason we thank you Raul and Teresa. BTW there are two locations and I have no idea how the other one is, but this was the 1363 N. Litchfield one."}
{"text":"My significant other and myself stopped here to take something home. She heard nothing but good reviews about this place so we decided to give it a try.
We were greeted promptly, from a couple of employees with smiles. We let them know we were ordering take out and were told someone would be with us shortly, which someone came out in a a minute.
We ordered our food, which she got a some type of chimichanga, and I got the Monday dinner special. The food came out in about 10 minutes, and we had a 10 minutes drive home. (Also, not sure if this matters, but our food came out on plates with plastic wrap around in, everything given to us in a box lid)
We chose well. Granted my tostada and taco wasn't cripsy because it was wrapped, it had really good flavor. As a matter of fact the whole plate tasted good. From the rice, to the refried beans, taco, enchilada, and tostada was well worth $8.99. Even the chips and salsa were good.
I am sure I would have given this place 5 stars if we were able to experience this place eating inside."}
{"text":"Sub par service.  Overpriced food.  4 bucks for one carne asada taco?  It was tasty but one taco no sides was almost 5 bucks.  I'm hitting up Don Panchos from now on"}
{"text":"Wow, what an awkward experience.  My wife and I decided to go here last night for the (and last) time.  When you walk in, we weren't sure to seat ourselves or wait to be seated.  The hostess was apparently doing something else.  There was no sign, and the waitresses were not around.  We finally get seated and and salsa were brought out.  Salsa was good but a little bit spicier than expected.....Oh wait, we hadn't gotten any drinks yet or even our drink order taken!  That took about 10 minutes from being seated until we received our drinks.  By the way, if you were looking to put salt on your chips, expect it to be all over your table.  No wax paper or anything underneath the chips, so it spills out from the basket they put them in.  My wife ordered the green sour cream enchiladas and I ordered the machaca chimi.  Hers had barely any taste whatsoever.  Very, very bland.  My chimi on the other hand was full of flavor but a bit on the salty side.  I have no idea how long I waited to get a refill on my drink.  They give you the bill (eventually) and you go up front to pay.

I've seen a lot of reviews about the service.  I don't think it's the waitresses fault.  It's a small establishment but they seem very understaffed for the wait times.  I would have rather gone across the street to Macayo's or in town to Garcias Las Avenidas."}
{"text":"We've been coming to R&T's since Moses' was a child.  R&T's is the BFFF of the valley, Best Food, Familia, Friends.  Mike has maintained a family owned environment for many years.  Gloria, Stella and Cesar are amazing.  They always make you feel at home.  The food is amazing, and $3 margaritas...seriously."}
{"text":"YAY!! The new location is open on the north side of 10 on Litchfield Road (the old Ichi-ban location) and the food was just as good as the south side of 10.  OK so the building doesn't have quite the same \"character\" as their original location, but that's OK.  The staff is just as friendly, the food as good and they kept 3 of the old Ichi-ban tapenyaki grill stations for fajitas grilling and tortilla cooking  .  We will certainly be back, but you do miss the old building a little, but this is now 1/2 way closer to our home!"}
{"text":"Consistently at it's best, great service, friendly, great prices. Could use a bit of TLC"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service was horrible. My family of 6 went one day over a weekend for lunch. We walked in and the sitting/waiting area is awkwardly positioned past the host station, no host standing there greeted us not even looked. Hosts continued texting as we stood there. Half my family went to sit down to wait as I asked if a table was available. We were told to take a seat and wait about 10 minutes while a table gets cleaned off. There were multiple tables with dishes left and we weren't the only guests waiting. We ended up waiting almost 30 minutes. Got a table after asking the hosts about it since they forgot about us. We waited about 15 until we got water. Our waitress was sweet and very nice. I won't be returning, unfortunately."}
{"text":"So yummy. Haven't had authentic Mexican in a while this did not disappoint had a sampling of many items tamale, enchilada, tacos beans and rice everything was on point"}
{"text":"Cleaner and newer than the MC85 location, but the service seems slower and the atmosphere is akin to a Chipotle restaurant. Food is pretty good though, hope they will be in business another 40 years."}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant for what seemed like authentic Mexican food. 
First, we were told there was no wait but then we waited over 10minutes for our tiny wobbly table in the back corner with our one year old. 
Then we were given two salsas. Told one was mild and one was hot. We tried the salsa with the chips that looked like they came out of a bag. The hot salsa was Cheyenne pepper mixed with chunky pace out of the jar salsa. The mild salsa shouldn't even be called salsa since it was just tomato sauce mixed with a bit of chili. 
I ordered the fish tacos and my husband ordered a combo platter. With our meal my husband ordered a Coke. 
Our meal came about 15 minutes later and we were still waiting for his Coke. While the plates were hot the food was just warm. My fish tacos were disgusting!! The beans and rice were okay but it's hard to screw up beans and rice. My husbands combo platter was okay. Cheese enchilada was okay, beef tamale was okay and his taco tasted like the disgusting fish. About half way through the meal came my husbands Coke. 
After waiting a half hour for our waiter to bring our check my husband went to the front to pay since we never did see our waiter again. 
Needless to say we will never go back and have no idea how this restaurant has stayed in business. Disappointment to the max."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a nice surprise after a long car ride. We are surrounded by chain restaurants and wanted something better. Initially, we weren't sure about this place. It was pretty empty at 3:00 pm and we were feeling like we might have made have made a mistake. The chips came quickly it's a smaller portion but they were warm and quickly gone. I requested another bowl and it was brought right away. We ordered and placed some special requests that were met. (Beans, rice, cheese, guac, and sour cream in the burros) The food came quickly and was pretty good. It met my Mexican food craving. It was $50 for 4 adult lunches and two beers. A little much for 3 burros and a chimichanga plate but we were happy and full."}
{"text":"I heard lots of good things about the place so we decided to give it a try. It was okay, but not someplace I would make the 20 mile drive to. Staff was attentive, prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"You know the foods horrible when you start the review with, \"the waitress was very friendly\". The chips were pretty good. Salsa was spicier than expected. The carne asada tastes like boiled meat with no flavor at all. The adoba tasted like boiled meat with chili powered. Beans and rice weren't too shabby. Service was slow. Margaritas tasted like a cheap party mix. 
I suppose all I can say is that the food will make a turd ;)."}
{"text":"Taking my oldest son to airport before holidays. Wanted to stop and eat before his flight. I seen lots of corporate resturants. Drove past I could smell the rich smell of authentic mexican food. Sign read that it had been in business for like 40 or 50 years. I didn't have to see yelp to know this was gonna be good, this just validated consistent good quality. I think they deserve four stars. Was suprised by price. But the food more then made up for it. Chips and salsa good. They are spicy loved it. They made sure to offer you refills or a extra pitcher to hold at you table. Ordered two tacos no tomato, with cheese enchallada rice and beans. The shredded beef tacos did not have a crazy fried shell crisp. More of a corn shell crisp tasked baked. Meet fresh and flavorful. And no tomatoes .thx! Rice was fresh didn't try beans. Enchallada sauce was wonderful. Grew up near mexico in San Diego. Best mex I have had in three years. On my way made small talk with cashier hostess. She said with pride the story of this family business. My wait for my serve was quick and the place was packed. I was excited that many people can't be wrong. If im in the area I will come back. Happy holidays."}
{"text":"Been here twice and LOVE the horchata but the salsa each time was potent with oregano and then either mild and bland or super spicy---and I like spicy! Service was slow and I just wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"I'll be honest and say that I went b/c I was on the hunt for a good margarita. I've had margaritas at all the nearby mexican food places (Manuel's, Chili's, Chipotle) and I wanted to give the Raul & Theresa's new location a try. The only one I saw on the menu was only $5 so I didn't have high hopes for it. It was a mix - which I think is LAME for a mexican restaurant - and not a very good mix at that.  Maybe there is a better one (top shelf?) available, I don't know but I couldn't even finish it. I had a burro and the meat inside was good but it wasn't anything special. It's called a restaurant, but I felt like it was only slightly better than any of the other fast food mexican options around. I'll go back to Chipotle next time. Their margaritas are excellent and less than five bucks."}
{"text":"I may be biased (as I spent 5 and a half years working at On The Border) but Raul and Theresa's doesn't cut it for me..plain and simple. Maybe I'll go back now that I've had some distance between myself and OTB...."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Margaritas are a great value during happy hour. Our bill was totally incorrect. Most likely will not come back when in town."}
{"text":"SOME of the best mexican food I have had in the valley. I never make it out to this part of the valley because I live more in the Scottsdale area. BUT while staying out here for Nascar weekend I came here with my boyfriends team and I was blown away. I know me some Mexican food! It's so good I can see myself making the trek out there to get my fix every now and then before the next race in November! The staff is super friendly! Salsa, and I think I am an expert.. I like it somewhat hot, but not 'can't swallow hot' .. was mind blowing. I had the shrimp and carne asada fajitas. Couldn't finish them. Generous portions; you won't go away hungry. We shared a pitcher of margaritas and I left happy.. happy..happy:-)"}
{"text":"I could eat here every day. The chicken fajitas are excellent If they don't  bring you guacamole ask for some it goes along perfectly with the chicken ( which can sometimes be a little dry because of the sizzling platter but it does have good flavor), and their tacos and enchiladas, especially Wednesday all you can eat tacos and enchiladas, are delicious the house Margarita is good and they've got all kinds of beer"}
{"text":"As a Hispanic woman, this was one of the worst tasting Mexican food I have ever eaten. The salsa was terrible, the food all around was horrible!"}
{"text":"So we arrived at around 7:30 pm on a Thursday night with my family of 8. 

We were the only ones inside the restaurant from what I could tell. 

The food was actually really good. Not great and I have had better but it was still pretty good for being the end of the day and almost closing time. 

The reason I won't return? Their wait staff. Our waitress was horrible. It took forever for her to keep coming back to our table to refill drinks, chips and salsa. She was sarcastic and snotty when my father asked her about the one of the dishes. 

Had to pull our chair out and stare in her direction for a good seven minutes for her to stop talking to the other 4 co workers and bring us our check and boxes. 

This place has the potential to be really good, just need to find some staff who want to make it that way is your problem."}
{"text":"Looking for good Mexican food in Goodyear, skip this spot.  There aren't many Mexican place in town, I know, but this isn't going to make up for it.  Bland food, with lots of rice and beans as filler. It's also a little over priced for what you get.  My opinion, but good Mexican food should be the simple ingredients that have flavor to them (marinated meat, corn/flour tortillas, beans, maybe rice), and not have to drown them in salsa to get some flavor.  Overall, this place doesn't do it for me."}
{"text":"Service was very slow upon arrival. Took awhile to be seated, the place was not busy. Food was great. Ordered green Chile burro with rice and beans. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the shredded beef tacos, the enchiladas and their salsa. It's a good \"go-to\" if you want straight forward Mexican food."}
{"text":"Raul and Theresa's is the only mexican restaurant we will eat at.  Absolutely the best fajitas, chips and beans!  The service is friendly and prompt. The food isn't salty at all and they are very willing to make any changes that you request (no salt, gluten, add spice, etc.)  Make sure you visit this location bc their original location on MC85 is under new ownership wit different recipes."}
{"text":"I missed an opportunity to review Raul and Theresa's a month ago. It was my birthday, so of course I was in the mood for Mexican food. Unfortunately, they were so busy (an hour wait on a rainy Saturday) that we chose to eat elsewhere. Still, for being so busy on a non-holiday, I was intrigued and wanted to come back.

Today is just another Saturday, so obviously I was in the mood for Mexican. My girlfriend and I enjoyed lunch here today. She is very familiar with the Litchfield Road location. According to her, the Menudo is one of her favorites. The interior decor is bright and cheerful to say the least.

We were greeted and seated promptly, received our drinks quickly, and got to work enjoying the chips and salsa. Very good salsa! It doesn't burn your tongue, but you will feel the spice once you start perspiring.

Today, I chose my entree in a different fashion. Instead of comparing something I am familiar with, I chose something that was different from anything I've tried anywhere. My choice was the sour cream enchiladas. It's misleading because the enchiladas are stuffed with cubed beef in a green chile sauce and topped with sour cream. And I had them add some cheese. These were some of the best enchiladas I've ever tried! The green chile sauce has so much good flavor and the sour cream only made it better! The rice was good, but average. However, the beans were absolutely delicious. Clearly they are homemade.

I'm glad I've finally discovered this restaurant, even if it's been around since the late 60's. You gotta respect a place that has Nopalitos on the menu! Another win for the west valley!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with a new friend who had eaten there often. Several lunch specials to choose from. I had the lunch Chimi, chicken with red sauce. Good sized portion with sour cream and guacamole on the side, rice and beans. The chicken chimi was OK, but the chicken while plentiful was rather dry and mushy (seemed more ground than pulled apart). Overall, not the best, but not the worst. Service was good, food arrived quickly, price was reasonable. Will probably try it again."}
{"text":"Wife and myself was out and about, spending some time together! We were actually across the street at totally wine, when we were a little hungry. Wife was told by her friend that Raul & Theresa's was a must try. Now here friend is a frequent customer at the Avondale location! So we ended up giving this place a try. Now when you first come in, this is not a restaurant that most people expect! It reminds me a lot like a fast food   atmosphere? Since we weren't that hungry, wife ordered their child's plate taco and cheese enchilada, I ordered the carne asada torta. I was happy their torta is small, since I just wanted to have a small meal! Their torta was all right! Wasn't that special at all, carne asada was not that great, just plain. Wife said there rice was great, everything else was OK. Now this is not the worst place we have been at, but it wasn't even close of being a great place to go! But if we are in the area again, we just might try it again."}
{"text":"Wish there was a option to give no star at all! Have been to this location twice.. 

First visit: waited a long time for food on a Tuesday night when it wasn't even busy. Waiter was rude, kept ignoring us to talk to the girl hostess. Threw our plates down when he came to deliver the food. Gave us pitchers of soda, tea, and water and check all at the same time.. 10 minutes after getting our meals. What if we wanted something else? Needless to say we didn't give him a tip. 

Second visit: did not want to go back but the crowd I was with insisted on it. It had been almost a year so I thought that boy could not be there still... he wasn't!

Everything was going good until the waitress who filled my water walked away and I noticed two flies in my drink.. I didn't make a fuss just asked the manager to bring another drink.. he said \"no, why did you put bugs in my cup\".. I thought to myself, ARE YOU FOR REAL? I couldn't believe I was hearing this.. he then tapped my shoulder and said \"okay I'll bring you a drink\".. but then went to stand by the door.. it took my husband getting upset to get me a drink.. this manager is an awful person.. even the girl cleaning menus said he's a d*ck!

Bad management and the staff is poorly trained. 

Will never return to this awful place.. the food isn't even good."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed! I use to go to the original location and loved it so when my in-laws suggested this for lunch yesterday I was excited. There were many open tables yet we waited almost an hour. The salsa sucked! And food was nothing great. Over all service was bad we did have a guy not our server who helped a lot because he was checking the football score and the tv was over our table if it wasn't for him we would have never of got a single refill or anything else very disappointed and won't be going back anytime soon"}
{"text":"The waitress made us feel as if we were interrupting her day.  The marguerite tasted like 7up.  The food was worse than Del Taco and Taco Bell. There was just no flavor to the food."}
{"text":"An off day.

The West Valley has had its share of  Mexican restaurants.  However, I get tired off the typical version of Mexican food drowned in sauce,  rice, and heavy beans. 

Today, I decided to give Raul and Theresa's a try. The dishes at Raul and Theresa's looked really good. That's why I feel bad saying that my meal today just wasn't very good. Today, I had the chorizo, eggs, beans, and tortilla breakfast. The chorizo was somewhat over cooked and just wasn't very flavorful, as were the beans.  I was disappointed with my meal. It wasn't the worst meal nor the best. Maybe it was an off day."}
{"text":"Ordered nachos to go over the phone. I asked for everything on them except meat- rice, beans, lettuce, guacamole, cheese etc. They asked if I wanted anything else on it and even read the order back to me. I picked it up, got home and it was a plate of chips with cheese and lettuce on top. And sour cream on the side. Seriously? Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Had some menudo on Sunday morning last week and will be going again. Perfect amount, great flavor, and good service.  The chorizo was also great. Didn't have all that cartilage which most places have."}
{"text":"NEVER COME HERE!! Terrible. Worst experience at a Mexican restaurant ever. I mean the food was straight out of a can. No flavor. Tasted old and reheated. Service was horrible and the owner thinks all the customers are crazy if they don't like the food. I should have left when I heard 2 separate parties complaint about the food while we were waiting. TELL EVERYONE TO STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"A mean-ass green sauce.  Fantastic attention from the wait staff, and an owner who goes out of his way to make your visit special.  What else is there to like?"}
{"text":"This place was BAD! Ok, so the complimentary chips and salsa were tasty, but that was the ONLY positive. The margaritas were completely lacking tequila, and the carnitas in my taquitos were burnt to a crisp. My wife's carne asada tacos tasted funny, as well. I'm actually surprised she didn't get sick from them. We will never eat here again."}
{"text":"When I think Mexican food I certainly will not have Ra√∫l and Theresa's in mind. I thought having a restaurant open for as long as this place has been opened that it would be an authentic place. This place is as Mexican as Taco Bell. The jalape√±os served on my plate were canned as opposed to freshly grilled. The food was definitely Americanized and watered-down Mexican. On a positive note the service was surprisingly good, the lady serving me reminded me of being at my aunts house and her bringing me a hot plate. I think if this place went to a Taqueria in Rocky Point or Ensenada and revisited its roots only then will it be able to bring back the authenticity that I yearned. I definitely will be going to central Phoenix for a true Mexican experience."}
{"text":"i would suggest eating elsewhere. there was dust covering the light fixtures and decorations. bathrooms there was toilet paper and paper towels all over the floor. all employees looked like they hated their lives. we had one person sit us, another person take our drink order but said that she couldnt take our meal order, then the waitress who brought us our meal we saw a total of two times. they left a whole pitcher of water with us which i question if they wash them between customers and if that place is sanitary. waaaaay to expensive for the cost of food. avoid this place"}
{"text":"Not the greatest Mexican food in the valley but DEFINITELY not the worst!

This is what I can compare to comfort food.  The service is great and the chips and salsa are pretty damn tasty!

There is a lot of cheese, of which I ask them to go light on and pretty Sonoran inspired.  

Wednesdays is all you can eat tacos and enchiladas.  Grab a beer and enjoy the laughs!"}
{"text":"This is a place I will NEVER return to.  WORST. FOOD. EVER!  The green chili burrito was so awful that I couldn't take a second bite and I really should have spit out the first.  The server asked us if we wanted take-home containers for our nearly-full plates.  When we declined,  she didn't question why were leaving so much food untouched.  The place was gross as there were gnats on the walls, the walls were filthy, and there was a dirty, dark corner where some employees sat.   In my opinion, this place honestly had the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten!"}
{"text":"Went here with family because they wanted to go. Apparently the owners used to just cook out of their house and finally moved into a restaurant. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed. Service was lackluster. It took a long time to get anyone's attention for even simple things like a water refill, and even longer to get orders and our food. Granted there was a large group there but the restaurant wasn't overly crowded other than that.
 The food was mediocre as well. All of the salsas they brought to the table were spicy. There was spicy and spicier, but no mild. The fajitas my husband ordered came with generous portions of meat and veggies but only 3(!) small corn tortillas. Nowhere near enough for the amount of food. My green burrito tasted primarily like poblano peppers. There was really no other flavor in the dish, and I just couldn't eat it. The waiter took away my dish with only 1 bite out of the burrito and didn't so much as ask if I liked it or if there was a problem. Not a good experience overall, and certainly not one that would encourage me to come back."}
{"text":"Best Food This Side of Town!! We drive from Buckeye, there Green Chili is Awesome, as well as the Teresa Special if you like things w a little more Spice.. 5 Stars from this Family"}
{"text":"This is the second location. The original is still location in Avondale on MC85. This one does not have the home feel like the original, but  is more like a regular restaurant, which you might prefer it if you are claustrophobic or don't like being in tight quarters with strangers.

The food is always fantastic. The enchilada sauce is the best I have ever had. I could drink it!! Food is consistent between locations and visits. Portions are generous. Prices between $7 and $13. One of my favorite places."}
{"text":"The restaurant was pretty much empty except for our family and another group. The salsa was good and the server was friendly and helpful. We had a variety of food: tacos, enchiladas and carne asada. Unfortunately the food was bland and not very good. Perhaps we caught the chef on a bad day."}
{"text":"Great place. Nice atmosphere, friendly, courteous waiter and excellent food. My first time there but my three friends recommended it as they live in the area. We had four different dishes for dinner all very good. Lots of Mexican restaurants in the area. This is one of the better ones."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I could eat here 3 meals a day. Happy hour prices don't hurt either!"}
{"text":"I was so excited they opened this location because it is much closer to my home. I love the Raul & Theresa's off the MC85 and thought for sure this would be the same.  Finally went today and I am so very disappointed! Worst Mexican Food I have ever had to be quite honest.  I got the Chorizo and Eggs and a beef taco.  The taco was bland and the Chorizo & eggs were burnt and just tasted horrible.  The service wasn't that great and it was very hot. Im sad to say I will never go back."}
{"text":"I will just say, there is NO COMPARISON to the original location on Main.   I was so, disappointed in the atmosphere, the service and the food was terrible.  The windows had no shades, the sun was glaring right where I was sitting in the middle of the restaurant, I will not go back to this location, I will continue to go to the one on Main."}
{"text":"Like love Mexican food, but this place was not a place I would go back to. The service was mediocre, but the good was awful. We won't be going back to this place, hopefully it gets better for other people."}
{"text":"Raul and Theresa's is good, especially if you are looking for a Mexican place that isn't a chain in Avondale/Goodyear. 

The inside is a bit stark and not very warm. Mostly tables and a few booths. It is very popular though. 
I had the pozole to start and rolled tacos for my entree. The pozole was fabulous. It's a huge serving and tons of meat. They serve all the fixings on the side. 

The rolled tacos were good, but needed the guacamole they were served with. I probably wouldn't order them again. 

I will return though to try some other things. 

Be aware, the original location on MC85 is no longer owned by the same family. They sold MC85 and brought the recipes to this location. 
That's right, the \"better\" \"I prefer the original\" \"I always go to MC85 location\" is no longer the same family! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service. Go to the original if craving Mexican food.  Took about 15 min to even be acknowledged. Only 5 tables with customers so they weren't busy. Had to ask for water twice. Waitress and busboy kept going back to kitchen for some reason."}
{"text":"Be nice if they remodel and class up a bit, go to cloth napkins, waitstaff takes the check up for you...etc

I like the tacos but probably could do better with the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"I usually eat at the original R&T's at MC85/Litchfield, but the food here seems to be just as good.  

Hands down I think they have the best homemade red enchilada sauce in Arizona.  I won't eat enchiladas at most Mexican restaurants because it tastes like canned sauce - not so at R&T's!

My favorite dish, which I have never found anywhere else - is the Sonoran Enchiladas.  (I order with a side of pico de gallo and sliced avocado - yum!)

I agree they could offer a mild salsa (even a *medium* salsa!) because their salsa is SPICY.  Don't get me wrong - it's great salsa - but I think a good portion - maybe even half - of their customers would appreciate it."}
{"text":"Went here today with my daughter for a late lunch. The place was fairly empty. We waited about 10 minutes before we even saw a server. Now if you like really hot salsa then this is the place for you, but I am from Louisiana and the salsa here took my breath away it was so hot. On top of that I didn't have water or my drink yet. Our server was very abrupt and to the point ( no friendliness here folks). When we were leaving we passed right behind the hostess who was playing on her cell phone and not a good by, thank y'all for coming in or nothing. There are a lot of better and friendlier Mexican places to eat in this area. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Walked in and it took a minute or 2 to be greeted. Guy told us that he would seat us in a moment even though there were plenty of areas for us to seat ourselves. Our booth had food and drink splattered on the walls and the tables even though had been wiped off were sticky and gross. Only half the string lights work and there is a good layer of dust matted on, which grossed out while eating. Chips were plain, salsa was watery and too spicy. Menu was confusing as there are too many options. My enchiladas were good though I might add. My fianc√©e chimi didn't come with red sauce and he said the beef was really salty. Service was okay. Not the worst but not the best. We were given our check, but then it took us a few minutes to be acknowledged to actually check out. I heard the servers talking in the back while we looked around the restaurant waiting to be told what to do. Guy came out and asked us if we were ready. Uhhh yeah we have been now for 5 minutes. After we asked what we do he said we pay up front. The lady charged my fianc√©es card 2 extra dollars because apparently they put on a \"service charge\" which basically means they make you pay for gratuity for 2 people -_- won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I actually prefer the new location to the original on mc85.  It's cleaner and the staff is outstanding.  The Sonoran enchiladas is fantastic and I really like the menudo as well."}
{"text":"This will be our 2nd trip here. First trip was the 2nd day opened.  Very good and generous portions. Great service.

This trip. Good service, server was professional and quick. (Danny)
Food portions were much much smaller. Burrito was very underfilled, refried beans were canned and salsa was in a styrofoam bowl.  But, the burrito was tasty as was the salsa.

Focus needed on portions and more servers at peak.

I commend Danny for his utmost professionalism and great communication skills. A true asset!"}
{"text":"Showed up, got seated. Hostess was asked \"what's good?\" Response: \"we have everything.\" She walked away, and we got ignored for 10+ minutes. We left."}
{"text":"Came here 2 years ago , they had just opened for the day we walked in and 3 people in the back seen us come in , not one came up to greet us, after one minute we walked out tried again yesterday and the same thing ,WTF , go up the street to the real one, I hope these two aren't related"}
{"text":"Visiting and found this great restaurant for breakfast .  The menudo and chorizo plate were top notch ."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday for their special. Felt like I had dinner in a shabby cafeteria. Food splattered all over the wall next to us at the table and paint peeling off the walls. Half the lights are out in the building, which is probably purposeful to hide the rest of the restaurant.

The tacos and enchiladas we had we're good but nothing out of the ordinary or anything special that I would ever come back for. The service was incredibly slow from the moment we got there and never really got much better during the time we were there.

If this was the only restaurant around I would say go there. The food wasn't the end of the world and you could live with the rest if you were really hungry. But if there were any other restaurant around, you'd be better off trying something you didn't know then eating here. There's no atmosphere and you don't feel like you're in a restaurant having a good night out. This place makes me sad for what it could be knowing that it has potential and seeing it wasted."}
{"text":"We didn't even bother to be seated. The restaurant is filthy and not busy enough to justify dirty tables. Too bad. We were looking forward to trying this place out."}
{"text":"I I love this restaurant, and im particularly fond of the Avondale one, but this one is nice too. Friendly staff, but the food I had wasn't that great. I ordered a carnitas burrito, and it was kind of bland. Half the burrito was salsa, the other half meat. Also had a carne Asada which was all meat in the burrito, lettuce on the side. I will still go back to this place, but probably won't order those again."}
{"text":"The food was great the wait time was decent not to bad. The service was horrible. Didn't check to see about refills or how was the food. The place was super busy. I think just a little bit more organized on tending to customers needs to be improved. I see people waiting and tables are open why haven't these customers been seated.  

March 12/17 review update
Second time coming and the food was good. The customer service of our waitress on the other hand something else.  She spills our salas says sorry. Never bothers to come and clean it. I would clean it if I had enough napkins but I only got one. She comes a second time still doesn't clean up the mess after it was her fault. We get our food and the whole time we have this mess in the middle of the table that needs cleaning. Finished food but mess still there. Didn't bother to come check on us. My last visit was a 3 star now it's a 1 star. When it comes to customer service expect low standards. What a shame :("}
{"text":"My wife & I decided to try Raul and Thereasa's today for lunch. We had one of the lunch specials. The food was excellent and they give you a lot of food:). The staff was friendly and the owner came by and greeted everyone to see how everything was. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Mexican food I've eaten in a restaurant ever!  It is like going to eat at Nana's House.  You immediately feel at home."}
{"text":"Average food at a fair price. Very basic decor. Staff seems a bit overwhelmed but all are very nice. 

I had carne assada and wifey had soft tacos. I ordered a patron marguerita which was good! Our waitress was running from table to table so we didn't see her at all until we were finished eating. She dropped out check and left. We weren't asked for drink refills or desserts. 

Overall, This is not bad fast food with a liquor license. We'd come back in a pinch but this won't be on the go to list."}
{"text":"For a Mexican place, the salsa with chips was disappointing!  I walked in and I was excited to try a new place, but once it took forever to get my Margarita which tasted like cheap tequila and to add to the bad salsa I knew I was done.  I was starving and with no waiter around I couldn't even place my food order.  I paid for my margarita and went somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"Tried giving this place a chance after a friend recommended it and have to say it was rather disappointing. Took my wife here for Mother's Day and the service was absolutely terrible. We were seated quickly but then service took a turn for the worse. Took about 10 minutes to get out drink orders. Another 10 to get them brought out. Have been waiting for about another 20 minutes to even order our food. All while our drinks are empty and no refills. 

Do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have tried Raul and Teresas breakfast. It was very good and simple. I had the Chorizo and egg breakfast and liked it alot. The chorizo was actually very good and it came with beans and tortillas. Not bad. We were served chips and salsa before our meal and enjoyed that also. We did actually wait for a while for our meals to come to us but luckily we did not have any starving kids with us. I will go back and try lunch or dinner then I can give a better review. The breakfast I had was worth going back to try it again."}
{"text":"Their service was great! The rice and beens were yummy. I ordered the fish tacos. At first when I smelled the fish I was thinking that it was not going to taste good, but I was wrong. Over all I was very pleased with the food and the care they went through for the take out, was very good."}
{"text":"Just moved to Az so trying to find a home style Mexican food place has been far and few. Sonia took great care of us really good food and lunch specials but best of all the supreme customer service really great soups tacos and fajitas A+"}
{"text":"It's not authentic or good. It's a Taco Time that serves alcohol. Their margaritas are good. I will give them that. Shrimp ala Mexicana was bland. Shredded beef taco was fried to a crisp. Even the flour tortilla was stale. So many better choices in the area."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here since 1994. They've expanded quite a bit, two locations now, but the original staff seems to all be here at the Litchfield location. 

There are nights when things are horribly slow but most of the time it's fine. 

Family-owned, has regulars; this is my go-to for Mexican."}
{"text":"I'll just say this.  Theres a Chili's thats right next to it.  Do yourself a favor and go to Chili's.  Trust me, you'll be so happy that you did.  I'm not sure what these other reviewers had or about their taste buds but the food was horrible!  I ordered the chimichanga and the person I was with ordered fajitas.  We were both very disappointed.  Besides that, the service sucked and the place is filthy.  That was definitely my first and last time there."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for Cinco de Mayo. First mistake going to a subpar mexican restaurant on Cinco de Mayo. Waited over an hour. This place is a three ringed circus. They push the food cart through the lobby of waiting patrons. Thats just nasty and the people sitting on the bench near the hostess station, well you get a work out because you gotta lift your feet and bring your knees to your chest so the waitstaff can plough through with the food cart.

Once seated we were greeted drinks were ordered, water, coors, and a double shot of Jack.  The coors showed up, then after ten minutes the water showed up.  \"Wheres my Jack?\" She rushed away and brought it back after a few. 

By the time she came back we were ready to order. Con caso for an appetizer and a few platters that dont matter.  Just the two of us. We watched as a tavle of 6 sat, drank, ordered then got their food and began eating. 45 minutes later no caso, no waitress.

Sink your teeth into my white ass Rauls. We got the fuck up and raised hell at the bar. Paid for my drinks and jammed out to 5 guys next door.  If I ever find myself in a situation where I would have to go back to this over glorified TacoHell..I'll break a bottle and ram it into my throat and bleed out before going back. 

I am growing tired of the service industry in Phoenix, nobody gives a flying fuck....why? Because there are millions of Phoenix mouths that are willing to forgo service for a quick cheap meal."}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant!!  Family owned and operated, excellent service, great food, we just love this place!"}
{"text":"Had the all you can eat Wednesday special.  Cheese enchiladas were good.  The tacos are fried with meat in them then toppings added.  Good meal for the price."}
{"text":"Food was great, the service was awful.  They were busy but we only saw our waitress a couple of times. NO refill on water in fact we weren't even asked if we wanted more water or anything else for that matter. We sat and waited, clearly finished, for our check and finally had to get up and ask for it. Not sure I will be back any time soon. Good service is a must in my book!!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I visited this restaurant for Saturday lunch with some hesitation based on the three star yelp reviews. However, our experience was positive. The server was very friendly and attentive, checking on us often to see if we enjoyed our meal or needed anything. I ordered the flautas and when I asked if the chicken or the beef was the better choice, she suggested I get one of each. She wasn't wrong, I really enjoyed my lunch. The hubby ordered breakfast and has huevos ranchero. When his food came there was no rice and when I asked, the waitress said it wasn't included in the meal. She came back after five minutes and brought him a little plate of rice.  We also really enjoyed the salsa, spicy with a nice smoky flavor. Not bad, would visit again."}
{"text":"Second location and still just as good.  Some of the best Red Chili I've had in town."}
{"text":"My husband and I had our first date at Raul and Teresa's over 10 years ago.  We still have lunch and sometimes dinner at this fabulous restaurant.  Okay the decor is a bit sparse and the chairs are a little creaky but if you let your mind wander you could be deep in Mexico and really enjoying the atmosphere.  The service is great, especially Alicia.  I had the chili relleno and it was the best.  My husband loves their enchiladas and tacos.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Family restaurant, the hostes is inviting, friendly and it feels like your going to see a family members restaurant.  Food is great, authentic.  Tacos, burrito, breakfast is all filling.  When I miss home I go here for some good food."}
{"text":"Good service great food. The salsa is a little in the white side (made for white folk). But it's spicy and the chips are good. They have orange Fanta so that's a major plus. I always order the \"Machaca\" and it is perfect, I only wish they have me more than 2 tortillas. This is a perfect place for lunch or dinner, although I do prefer the original restaurant that's 10 miles south of this one."}
{"text":"Service here was really good. Food was pretty good also. Been trying to find the one place we can always go to for great Mexican food! I am not sure this will be the place, but since it could have been an off day I will be going back so I can get them a fair shot. I just want a crunchy chimichanga."}
{"text":"The food is great and the service is outstanding. We get to the west side of Phoenix once or twice a month for my father-in-law's doctor visits. We discovered Raul & Theresa's a couple of years ago and it's become a favorite! We're even planning a big family get together there this winter. I love the dish called \"Theresa's Special\" and its yummy consistency. My father-in-law loves the Chorizo and Eggs. If you find yourself on Litchfield Road this place is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"This place is just nasty. I make better Mexican food and I'm white- my Mexican husband is in agreement."}
{"text":"We went for dinner last night.  The sign in the window says open until 9:00 pm  We arrived at 8:30.  Manager wouldn't let the staff wait on us.  What the heck?  How can we shop local/shop small if the shop won't wait on you?

For the record, we were a party of 4 adults, not drunk, not inappropriately dressed.  We brought our out of town guests to our favorite local mexican restaurant and were embarrassed to be turned away.  Clearly, the staff had decided to shut it down early as the floors were being mopped and the kitchen lights were off.  

If you're not going to be open until 9:00 p.m., please don't post your hours as such."}
{"text":"Terrible service and slow. Waited at our table for 40 minutes to get checked on once. Ran out of drinks and chips. Finally got up to leave due to wait and poor service AND THEY FORCED US TO PAY FOR OUR DRINKS!!! WATER AND SODA!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night,  food and service was good,  price about average for a Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"Service was ok but the food that another family member had came out cold the taco and beans were cold and they tried to give him another and that was cold also. Instead of just saying not paying for it which one taco and one tostada were almost 4 dollars each they gave us 10% off which was 2.28 cents? Won't go there again."}
{"text":"This is easily the best Mexican food in Arizona...All of the food was good and the sauce's are homemade..My daughter asked what something was on the menu and he brought her out a sample of it.. Not only that he brought us all a sample of every type there was so we could all try it..The food is priced lower then any Mexican place in Az but the quality is that of an expensive resteraunt..To top it all of we had ice cream which was only 3.50 compared to the normal 4.99 at any other Mexican food place and it was THE BEST FRIED ICE CREAM ever!!!! The service also was second to none!!!  Our new fave!"}
{"text":"finally checked this place out.  food was ok. nothing to brag about . have had better mexican in the west valley/"}
{"text":"If this is what you call \"Authentic\" Mexican food? First the coffee was more like tea. The beans were canned oh and so is their enchilada sauce and nopalitos. Nothing is fresh. Menudo tasted old. Waitress was bleh kinda rude. Should've went to Filibertos! 1st and last time we come here."}
{"text":"My husband and I drove 30 miles to eat at this restaurant based on the good reviews and for it's \"traditional Mexican food.\" Am I missing something? My shredded beef burrito was just that...shredded beef inside a flour tortilla; no cheese, no sauce, no spices...in other words, no taste. The chili relleno was served omelette style, which was ok, but not stuffed with cheese. It had some Velveta style cheese on top, but no green chili. My husband had a chicken chimichunga, which like my burrito, was just shredded dark meat chicken in a fried flour tortilla. The salsa, rice and beans were the only things here good. The place was packed with people waiting for tables. I don't see why."}
{"text":"Great food and fast service. Went in for early take out at 4:30 pm.  Not busy. Had chimichangas , rolled tacos and small mex hat salads. Oh and chips and salsa!  All was really good. Portion were plentiful. Gave us plenty of guac and sour cream. I'll return when in town again."}
{"text":"This place is pretty disappointing. The place looks nice on the outside but the inside is quite dirty. They have a missing sink in the bathroom and there was toilet paper all over the floor. Several tables in the lobby were trashed for over 10 minutes. Our server was eh. I got a stoic vibe from her. If you're a waitress you should have energy and inform guests about specials you're having."}
{"text":"So a group of friends and I went here on a Sunday afternoon after church . To be honest I have seen this place before, but live in the city... Sad  I know. The customer service was great and the food came out pretty quick. The taste was better than most generic Mexican restaurants out in Arizona. I had the cardne asada burrito, but I need to try other things. I recommend coming here."}
{"text":"So, this was our second visit to this location. This was completely unplanned due to a disaster at Betty's Nosh that left us mad and hungry. See that review for more. This time, we kept it simple and ordered the tacos. The beef was seasoned. but could use more umph, and the crispness was just about perfect. Another 10 seconds in the fryer and they may have earned 3.5 stars. The table salsa is one of the more unique among many. The decor is still a miss. Half fast food, half sit down place. Service was good. We will go back if it is convenient, but won't go out of our way."}
{"text":"Although the Theresa special and beans were pretty food the salsa was like tomato sauce with red chilli seeds and some cilantro it had bite but that's about it, shrimp burrito had more juice than shrimp but was average. We will not be back, there are way to many choices for median food in the west valley. We should have driven to Po Po's..."}
{"text":"I came here wanting a michelada and was very disappointed. It wasn't great at all. It tasted as if they just poured Clamato juice in my beer. Service was slow and it wasn't busy at all. Food was ok."}
{"text":"I was so hoping for a great experience. The food was very good, but there are three un-cleaned tables and no one is making an effort to clean them. I ordered a margarita and it came in a water glass. It was so small that I should have ordered a beer because there is more in a  Coors Light bottle than what I got in my on the rocks margarita. We ordered a salad as an appetizer and it showed up with dinner. The salad was the chopped lettuce they use in taco and not regular hand leaf lettuce. Regardless, the veggie burrito they made me was awesome and really good. Was so wanting this to be better. FYI - the margarita ended up being $5.00 for about 8oz of drink."}
{"text":"I think the cheese was American cheese.  Nice people, food was not authentic..."}
{"text":"My review comes after 3 separate occasions where I have had the chance to eat here.  The first was not so overwhelming as I was disappointed my check was charged an 18%  gratuity for lack-luster service.  In addition to that, there was a space to add a gratuity as if it had not already been added....very underhanded.

The food on this winter Sunday morning made up for the billing issue.  We had a group of friends meet there for breakfast on a Sunday and ended up staying for over three hours.  Honestly my memory fails me of the dish I ordered but finishing it was not a problem as it was quite good.  In fact, everyone there was happy if not impressed with their choices. 

The 2nd venture there was with my best friend Melissa.  We were limited on time and called ahead for our lunch to be eaten there.  When we walked in, sure enough, our food was waiting for us on the table, covered with foil to keep it hot.  Simple lunch specials but delicious nonetheless.  Mel and I we quite impressed they took the time to follow through with the order , get it right, keep it hot and make us feel so valued when in fact they had no idea who was coming to dinner.  Two very enthusiastic thumbs up for the service!

Visit #3 was again with Melissa and also for lunch.  This time we were not so hard pressed to get out of there so we were able to relax a chat up the place.  Very simpleton in the decor department but I am not there to be impressed with a pretty picture.  Does the food taste authentic and would I eat there again....these are the real questions.  

The answers are YES and YES!  Delicious, hot, reasonably fast and a place I will be going back to soon.  The lunch specials are cheap, filling and worth a repeat visit!  Comparing it to some other Mexican places in the immediate area, this one is one of the betters ones, hands down. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very subpar Mexican food.

Possibly THEE worst Huevos Rancheros I've ever tasted.

The chips and (hot) salsa was decent, but the mild salsa straight tasted like tomato paste."}
{"text":"Not terrible, not the greatest. We ordered the green chile and bean nachos. They were good but were literally green chile, beans and cheese. They had good flavor but I like loaded nachos. The margaritas were just ok. The service was good and the waitress was very friendly."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and the customer service is phenomenal. Feels like family. Tables felt a little sticky, but overall the place was clean and colorful. We like the enchilada sauce and tacos."}
{"text":"Used to go to the original 20 years ago when I lived in Estrella, and remember it being pretty good family style Mexican food. I had lunch at this location today and recognized a couple servers from way back. The food wasn't as good as I remember and the service was ten times worse. It took around five minutes for anyone to bring water, and a couple minutes later I was asked if I wanted chips. Nobody has ever asked if I want chips at a Mexican restaurant, that's half the reason we are there. Finally a server comes and takes my order and close to 15 minutes later I had two tacos, pretty small and rather greasy. I put a $20 in plain sight on the table and ate my lunch. After playing on my phone for a good ten more minutes a busboy came and grabbed the $20 and went to cash me out. A completely new server brought my change. I quickly left 10% and made my way to the door where half the staff was standing around talking by the register. I may go back to the original for nostalgia sake, but maybe in another 20 years."}
{"text":"I should have known when we got here and it was empty on Cinco De Mayo, that I should have turned around and got back in my car. The mild salsa tasted like tomato sauce from a can, the hotter one was good. I had never been here before so I asked the server a few questions about the menu, such as, do you have Pollo a la cream? She had no idea what that was, how do you not know what that is? I asked if the Chile Verde was made with Jalape√±o or Serrano and she said neither, it's made with green chilies.....said NO MEXICAN EVER, but she did!!!  She said the old white people can't do heat, ummmm, really, Cuz you serve hot salsa with chip's. If they don't want spicy  don't order Chile Verde. I asked how the Carne Asada was, she said, \"It's  a slab of meat\", yes, she really said that. I said, \"What are you talking about, what makes Carne Asad a is the marinade, you know, lime juice, orange juice, cilantro, spices...heeelllloo???!! She said the only put salt and pepper on theirs  baby....yes, ever sentence ended with her calling me baby, well honey, I'm maybe 10 years your junior and a grandmother, so don't call me baby. Also, she dropped off the check, my daughter had not eaten her tamales, cuz they SUCKED, worst I've ever had, horrible after taste, and I had about 3/4 of my food left, she said here you go baby and left the bill on the table, didn't offer a box, didn't ask how the food was...that we weren't eating... NOTHING, so rude....fyi I did tell her the tamales were not good, she said tell the front, no apology or offer of anything else for my daughter. The lady who cashed us out was equally rude. How do you stay in business??!! Most certainly NOT even what I would call Mexican food, watered down old white people food is what they should call it."}
{"text":"My aunt raved about this family that used to cook amazing Mexican food out of their house years ago. After she heard that they opened a restaurant, we decided to go one night. The food was decent but the service was almost nonexistant. After being there for about an hour I managed to get 1 refill of my drink.

The fajitas were good but they only gave 2 small tortillas. I ended up eating most of it with just a fork. Didn't feel very fajita-ish to me.

The salsa was good but my family complained that even the mild was pretty hot. I like heat so I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Good, but not great food. The Caldo de Pollo could have been excellent with 20% less salt and more lemon juice. Even so... I found it satisfyingly meaty with a fair amount of veggies--a good healthy choice. My chicken taco was lightly fried and above average. My husband's Nopalitos were tasty, but I think the verde sauce would have been a better choice. He was surprised to find meat included (pork or chicken?). 
We got great service late on New Year's Day.  Maybe it wasn't too crowded. Our waitress seemed to care if we enjoyed our food. That's always nice. 
This location has easy access from I-10 for travelers."}
{"text":"Loved the food here! Had beef taco and green burrito combo! Very good chips and salsa. Service is top notch!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. No one sitting on patio and I had to talk our waitress into seating us outside. Food was too well done. Charged us for drinks we didn't order. Of course we will speak up, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for the first time & enjoyed it very much. Wife and I were greeted warmly at the door and seated promptly. We were given a bowl of warm tortilla chips and a mild salsa and a hotter salsa. We found the hotter salsa to be very flavorful. The $5 house margaritas were excellent too. Wife ordered the chicken tostada. It was a perfect size and contained all white meat chicken. The lettuce and tomatoes were fresh and crisp. She used the hot salsa as a dressing and ate the whole plate. I had the 3 soft rolled tacos with carnitas. The pork was moist and tasted great! It came with guac and I added fresh jalape√±os on the side. I will definitely eat these again. We cannot wait to come back and try more things on the menu."}
