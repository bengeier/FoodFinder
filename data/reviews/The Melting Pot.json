{"text":"Went here to celebrate my anniversary. Food was good. But not lick the bowl clean good. 

For the amount of money we spent I think we could have done better. But the meal was fine. Service was great. 

Dessert is to die for. Pound cake & chooclate fondue. Enough said! 

I agree with other posters who suggest just going for dessert. The food isn't worth the price."}
{"text":"I came here twice, each time with a different group of friends. The setting is nice and dressy. The restaurant is freezing cold, they crank up their air conditioning probably because each table has 1-2 stoves in front of them. So even if it's humid outside I suggest you to bring a light zip up jacket 

During my first visit I went went with 5 other friends. All six of us ordered the 4 course meal. We had a friendly waiter that tried really hard to learn everyone names. As for the food. The cheese fondue was delicious it came with bread, nachos, apples, and vegetables to dip with. The salad, main course and chocolate fondue that came following were okay. It's wasn't exceptional good. It's not worth what you pay for. Not including tips it was $50/person including tax. Although it was a 4 course meal what they give you isn't worth what you are paying for. For example for the cheese fondue it's just a small cup of vegetables, apples, and nachos with a ton of bread to soak up all the cheese. Although this course was good I wouldn't say it's worth it. 

The second time i came with 8 other people. They charged a mandatory 18% gratuity  on our bill which i thought was ridiculous. I understand they charge 15% for larger parties...but 18% is a bit much. So with tax its a extra 31% charge on your meal. And because there was a  mandatory gratuity the waiter really didn't care about his service. He gave us attitude. I had to ask him for water 3 times before he remembered to refill our cups with water. I asked for a refill since the cheese fondue, then finally at the end of my 3rd course (the main course) he finally brought out a jug of water. Since there were 9 of us we were at two different tables. The other table didn't get their main course till literately 30-40minutes after we got ours. It took our waiter another 30 minute to give us our bill. So we just put down the exact change so we could leave right away. We were there from 6pm till just past 10pm. So it was a LONG LONG dinner. 

Since we know that the 4 course meal was expensive amongst the 4 at one table we shared ONE cheese fondue order and we each ordered a main course that came with the salad. Yet the bill came out to be $44 including tips and tax. Which I thought was ridiculously expensive. 

Be prepared for it  to be minimum 3 hour meal. Its a huge waste of time and money. Unless if you need to kill time do NOT come hear. After my second visit I have decided I'll never return here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible experience. My boyfriend took me here for my 20th birthday and got me the 'Romance Package'. We got our own private little booth with curtains, a bouquet of roses, and what seemed to be our own personal server. She was probably helping other tables as well but she made us seem like we were the only ones in the place. The food was not only amazing, it was an extraordinarily fun experience. We cooked it to our own tastes and there was so much extra to choose from! The portions are perfect for two and we could barely walk out of the restaurant afterwards because of all the different courses! I will definitely be visiting The Melting Pot as often as I can. Although a bit pricy, the ambience, food, and experience is completely worth it."}
{"text":"Sad to say it, but we did not like the experience. Novel idea, but we will not return.

Price: $100 for two including tip. Extremely high considering what we got for it.

Food quality: excellent food quality but extremely small portions. Also, the cheese for the fondue did not seem very high-quality, even though the waitress bragged about it on more than one occasion.

You cook your own food, which was a surprise. my girlfriend and I did not like that part at all. We just wanted to eat.

The dessert fondue was very good. Even so, you only get small pieces of sweet stuff, ie, poundcake, marshmallows, and fruit, etc. to dip in the fondue.

(I have read other reviews. Apparently an all you can eat option was available, and apparently, this was not the option we chose, because the waitress did not mention this. We chose the four course dinner.)

Don't come here if you are looking for large portions or food that you don't have to cook yourself.

one other thing: you cook your own food by boiling it. That means if you order steak or meat that you boil it. When it comes out of the boiler it does taste delicious; however, all the red meat looks gray, which is unappealing. and I find the idea of boiled meats such as steak also unappealing on principle.

Service: The waitress made us wait far too long between courses. It took two hours to eat here. she was, however, a nice and knowledgeable person. But she also forgot to give us our chocolate covered strawberries, which we won by checking in on yelp, even though we reminded her several times.

Cleanliness: The place was very clean. Nice ambience with low lighting and very private booths complete with curtains."}
{"text":"The whole experience was great! We went there to celebrate our one year anniversary. We were able to sit in a private booth and enjoy each other's company. The waiter gave just enough service to not feel neglected but also keep it private for us. 

We had the spinach artichoke cheese, the house salad, All you can eat meat fondue, and s'mores chocolate dessert! Everything was delicious but my favorite part was defiantly the dessert. They provide Oreo and graham cracker covered marshmallows, bananas, strawberries, brownies, rice crispy bars, and pound cake to dip into the chocolate! 

Overall, a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I love the Melting Pot! We have been coming here every year for our anniversary and they give us an amazing experience and make us feel so special! We have been coming since 2011 and will continue to come for the great service and wonderful food. The 4 course experience is a must have for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for special occasions with the boyfriend! DESSERTS ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD!"}
{"text":"Fun and classy \"hot pot\" makes for a great night out.

For most of us Markhamites, East Beaver Creek is just about the only game in town when it comes to a cool, chic night out (as long as you're prepared to bring the $$$s). The cluster of restos that have lasted the longest are the slick versions of Alice Fazooli's, Marlowe's, Jack Astor's, Moxie's and the Keg. The two others that have stuck around are similar -moderately upscale, slightly pricier versions of restos you can get elsewhere in town- and include Destiny, a bubble tea slash Chinese cuisine resto, and Chako, an upscale Korean BBQ joint.

Enter The Melting Pot. Similar in concept to the Korean across the plaza (or the hot pot down the street) but offering a very different vibe. Cook and eat your food at the table with your choice of items with fancy potstickers. It brings the chic but is unpretentious in its approach to the 'active social eating' experience. And the food quality is very good to boot, with a thoughtful menu and a varied drink selection. 


Atmosphere:

Clean, minimal and bordering on the austere, it walks a fine line between calm, chic family booth-time and a medium-lit elegant evening for groups. The walls are cream, mostly unadorned, the booths a lightly patterned, unremarkable wood and the comfortable seats a soft grey that even now blends into my mind's eye (I can't visualize the exact colour, ack, that drives me nuts). 

The paintings that pop up every so often are abstract - the ones in the bar area mimicking the amazing round cutout lights in the front and the ones in the back are blue polka-dotted - ahem pointillist- colourfields. Not sure if the arrangement is a work in progress or not, because they aren't stylistically unified, which I found surprising given the amount of thought given to the layout. And it's smart. 

The resto is good for multiple groups. Small ones like ours (three) at the bar. Tall tables next to the bar for same. Right near the entrance, several big booths for families or groups of 4-10. Inside, honeycomb booth style seating for friends with the option of linking two booths together to accommodate a larger group (accomplished by dropping a sliding divider-wall). Another 'wing' has intimate tables for two, with full walls to the ceiling on three sides. Nicely discreet. If your chocolate fondue happens to come with a side helping of smooch, you won't have grandma next door giving you cuteye for ruining the children. 


Food:

Not cheap, but quality. We ordered two fondues, the fiesta and the cheddar. I am no fondue queen. The only fondue I've had has been the one you get in your stocking at Christmas, you know, light a candle under the bowl and melt some Chipits from Bulk Barn. Mmm mmm good. But I do know a bit about cheeses. 

I was pleasantly surprised at both offerings - at the depth of the flavour of the cheese, the smooth texture and heat of the mixture, and the interesting additions that the lager and the homemade salsa added to the overall taste. I was ready to pay for melty Swiss (it was a friend's birthday) but it was much better than that. So we invested in a second order of cheese.

The dippers were apple chunks, raw veggies, breads and tortilla chips (yay for sort-of nutrition?). I am still sad about the lack of Parisian breads in Canada (sob), and really nothing's going to compare, but I was personally hoping for a little more from the breads on offer, though they were good.

I ordered a nice $11 Chianti and a Mill Street Tankhouse (the latter much better with the cheese). My friends ordered the Raspberry Truffle and S'more martinis, which were tasty at $9. The standout was the $13 Yin Yang which was a delicious iced-milkshake of alcoholic fun. 

Our bill came to $79, which is quite good when one factors in four drinks.


Service:

Standout service at the bar. One guy behind the counter, but who needs more? He was a machine, managing to hold down five conversations at one time while handling drinks, making the bar fondues (yes actually stirring and adding spices to them) and fielding drink orders from the floor. Charming fellow with a great personality, we all agreed he made our night extra-fab.


Overall:
 
We'd go back for the novelty of the fondue, for a fun group gathering, for a date, or for Happy Hour. Wear something nice but you can leave the heels at home. if you want a lounge walk over to Fazooli's for a cocktail - Melting Pot will still love you if you're wearing your flats. Drop in a give it a try - it's the only one in Canada!

Oh and did I mention that the chef is Chef Corbin from Dinner Party Wars?  I had no idea, but he came over for a chat and a pic. Nice fellow."}
{"text":"We decided to buck the system and NOT get the Big Night Out this last time.  You get bread and veggies with the cheese fondue anyway and  the \"vegetarian entree\" fondue is just a little bit of pasta and more of the same veggies stewed down in broth.  If you like meat, BNO is the way to go.  But since the carnivores were the minority this time, we  had cheese, salad, cheese again (whoo-hoo) followed buy a wonderful chocolate fondue flambé.   The love martini had cute strawberry hearts and the yin and yang martini is white and dark chocolate frozen heaven in a glass.  Our waiter Ricky was very attentive and the manager stopped by our table twice.  When we mentioned the manager to the server he said how great she is to work for.  Usually happy servers = happy customers.  This place is very well run; the hostess, the bartender, waiters and bussers were all top-notch."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and inviting, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the food was fantastic... what more could you ask for? Our waiter found out it was a special occasion, and we were served a lovely \"Happy Anniversary!\" dessert.   I can't wait to use my upcoming birthday as an excuse to come back!"}
{"text":"This particular Melting Pot is new, so that may be why my experience was not pleasant, but I usually love this place and now I will not return to this location.  The one in Scottsdale is farther away from where I live but after the horrible experience I had, I would much rather drive further to get better service.  

I went with my husband for Valentine's Day where we bought the whole package deal and had reservations made in advance.  We arrived and were seated promptly, which was about the only good thing about the whole meal.  The waiter seemed nice enough at first but after welcoming us and leaving us to go over the menu options it all went downhill.  The waiter took about 15-20 minutes to return and take our order.  He then forgot our drinks and they didn't arrive for another 10 minutes when he brought out our food.  After the cheese fondue course he once again was slow bringing out our salads and was never around when I needed a refill on my tea.  Then the main part where the meats were served was just horrible.  All of the meat was extremely salty and tasted like it had been marinated way too long.  The dessert was also poor quality because they ran out of some items that were suppose to be on the plate.  

Then the manager stopped by all of the tables around us but for some reason just walked by us without any acknowledgment which was rude and unprofessional.  At the end of the meal the waiter gave us our gift and just walked away while other servers around us explained what was in the bag and thanked the other customers for coming.  We also almost walked out of the door without the picture they took of us (part of the package) until the hostess explained where they were to be picked up.  I did fill out a survey on their website about what happened and the manager called the next night at 7pm and apologized in a hurry and told me to call him back.  I did try to call him back and he was not working that night, but he never called again.  I'm disappointed that this experience ruined my perception of this restaurant.  Next time I will definitely not come to this location!"}
{"text":"My fiancee and I came here for a nice night out. I'll admit that the food is pricey (and you do \"cook\" it yourself). However, the overall atmosphere and fun of the food made it worth while. The wait staff was good at keeping our glasses full, as well as recommending the various flavors. I would definitely come back here (provided I save up for it). 

My only complaint: Price. While the night was great and we went home full, it did costs over $100.00 for the two of us. Provided you don't get dessert, you're looking at around $75.00 for a meal here. 

On a side note: A few people complain that you cook your own food. Isn't that what fondue is about?"}
{"text":"We go to the Melting Pot 3 or 4 times a year and always have a fantastic experience. We were a little sad when they discontinued the Wisconsin trio cheese fondue, but have tried the bacon and gorgonzola and loved it.

You need to make a reservation for this restaurant. Our dining experiences are usually about 2 hours each  and no one should show up expecting to get right in.  

They've really stepped up the items accompanying the chocolate fondue. There's pound cake, brownies, blondies, and even pineapple now.  How delicious is chocolate-covered pineapple!  

And the sauces for the meat! They have sweet and sour, teriyaki, curry, gorgonzola port, and something called Green Goddess which is awesome on the veggies.  The curry is my favorite, and I don't even like curry.  :)

I think this is a great bargain: about $40 per person gets you cheese fondue, salad, shrimp/chicken/filet/sirloin, and awesome chocolate fondue.  Spend a bit more and try a drink or two.  Great wine selection, hubby likes the sangria, and you can't go wrong with the Love Martini."}
{"text":"Haven't been to The Melting Pot in years and this experience was much better than the first.  Our four course dinner was good with the highlights being the cheese and chocolate fondues.  Our server Devon was personable, polite, and professional.  My wife and I will most certainly be back for more dessert.  Thank you for a nice evening."}
{"text":"Loved the food and experience, and the service. I would however reserve this for a special occasion. We had dinner and a couple drinks for two and it was $145 plus the tip. I would not go here on a regular basis. My drink was great, it had 5 different kinds of rum in it. 

We did have fun though...We had the Wisconsin Cheese appetizer and then the caesar salads and the creme brulee for desert. I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the cost.  They do have happy hour specials between 4-6 pm that sound good."}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent!!! My wife and I went there for our 19th Anniversary  what really nice that no one was there except for 2 other couples."}
{"text":"Wife and I decided to use our 2 course groupon and invited another couple to join us.  We were greeted professionally and seated right away. Service was a little slow but we were in no hurry. We explained to the waitress that we wanted to use the groupon but would upgrade to the 4 course meal and she said we would get a discount. 
We had a fabulous time and the food was great.
We get the bill and its $217 but they graciously credited the $37 we had already paid for the groupon and then added a $10 discount.
$10 DISCOUNT!?
The groupon was supposed to be a $74 value and we get a $10 discount on a $217 bill?
We felt totally ripped off and the manager acted astounded that we didn't appreciate the $10
We will not be back!"}
{"text":"Great waiter great professionalism.  The experience was awesome to try but to me this place is like a once in a blue moon not one of those places I would go to often. But an awesome first experience if you have never been there!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour in the bar! Had a good time with a group of women after bridal shopping in the center. Good price on drinks and the cheese fondue. Fun atmosphere and the staff was fun too. Will visit again one day for sure."}
{"text":"This was our 5th experience at this Melting Pot location. Our waiter was  bland and unfriendly. He made a mistake on our food order and argued with us about what we ordered!

Instead of bringing us the one missing food item, he took both of our plates. We had to wait another 10 minutes for him to bring back our correct dinner order.

Each time he came to our table he left our curtain open and we had to stand up and close it!

We were seated near a table with 2 small children. These children shouted, screamed, and ran up and down the aisles of the restaurant.  We complained to our waiter and he had the manager stop by our table. Instead of apologizing the manager said that it is always like this, this is a family restaurant, and the owner doesn't care.

Um, no, The Melting Pot IS NOT a family restaurant; I've never seen young children yelling, screaming, and running up and down the aisles, and I've been to the other locations in Arizona and have never had the impression that the owner doesn't care.

There were LOTS of tables open tonight.

I'll go back when they get a new manager..."}
{"text":"This place is s bit pricey but otherwise fun to go to. I had s great time with friends because you can spend a lot of time talking."}
{"text":"When I heard they were participating in restaurant week I was thrilled! Usually every time I come here I spend no less than $150 so this was a bargain! As always the meal was delicious and fun but what made this experience truly fantastic was the service. We got there about an hour before closing and at many other restaurants the service would have been crappy and rushed but our server Christine was such a joy! She was attentive and upbeat and her service was right on point. It was an absolute pleasure having her as our server and I will be returning for sure, requesting one of her tables. Thank you Christine!"}
{"text":"Went to this place with my smarter half to enjoy a relaxing night sans children.  The wait staff was very attentive to our needs and aside from a lack of wine pairing knowledge they were very good to us.  The dessert is absolutely amazing!  definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"First off let me start by saying that the last time I had fondue was in the 1970's while my parents where having a canasta card party! 
So my wife says, \"I have a surprise for Valentines for us\"; which always makes me wonder, hum. We end up at the Melting Pot and I think, oh boy, lots of cheese and I haven't had a bathroom break in a day or two!
Well, we were a few minutes late for our reservation but the hostess was great and took us right in. We were greeted by our waiter and I immediately found out he knows everything you need to know about cheese, broth, cooking and just about everything in between. So, my wife had set us up for the Valentines package where you get a champagne toast with different choices for appetisers, main dish and desserts. 
Well, here's where the fun begins! Let's just say the cheese portion was a small piece of this whole thing.  Mind you I do have a little problem 'boiling my meat' in a pot, but I have to tell you I was surprised! 
Everything was fresh and the sauces that were provided to accompany our choices were great. 
Needless to say, I was very impressed with the service as well as the food.
I say, this place is more than just another CHEESY restaurant! Thanks Melting Pot for a great Valentines Romantic dinner."}
{"text":"The quality of the food for the fondue was suspect. All of the shrimp were small and not deveined. The other items were not evenly cubed and they did not provide a timer for the table. Thank you Windows Phone! The cooking oil was not enough when it came out which delayed the meal by about 15 minutes.
For a family of two adults and two kids the bill came to $160. That's with two domestic draft beers and lemonade for the kids.
The original chocolate fondue with peanut butter was pretty good but how do really screw up chocolate fondue."}
{"text":"We had a great experience and our waitress was the BEST!!!  Very knowledgeable and helpful. This was our first visit. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My now Hubby & I used to go to the Melting Pot every anniversary. We would to go to the Scottsdale location, but on our most recent Valentine's Day outting, we went to the new Glendale location. 

Like I said, it was Vday so they had a specialty menu set up just for it. For the cheese fondue we opted to try the Spinach & Artichoke, which we had never tried before, it was so yummy! For our salads, my Hubby got the Club & I got the Ceaser. Mine was good, pretty standard, but Hubs said his sucked. I can't recall the name of our main course since it was a special running for that weekend only, but I know it had Lobster somewhere in the name! The meats & veggies were yummy & we the used Coq au Vin cooking style like we always do. For dessert we ordered the Smores, we've had it before so we knew what to expect but it was delicious! During dinner we did order a bottle of Kendall Jackson red & a bottle of Martini Rossi, we went cheap since we knew dinner was going to be a lot! Oh & at the end of our meal they gave us complimentary glasses of what I beileve was Spumante (red, champagne). Nice touch but that bottle costs like $8 at the grocery store :p

At the end of our meal they did have a nice little gift bag with a bottle of their Garlic & Wine seasoning, their milk chocolate fondue bar, mints, a coupon & a picture frame. They were supposed to take our pic & then we would put that pic in the frame but they never took our pic. Oh well, got pics on our own camera any way.

After this last visit we have decided to no longer make this our \"anniversary spot\". Coming up this December is our 1st wedding anniversary so we are going to find a new place. We love you Melting Pot but the prices are just so not worth it!"}
{"text":"I had high  hopes for this place...I mean fondue....how do you screw that up? Well, I figured out that you can! FIrst of all we ordered cocktails and they said they could not make mine because their blender was broken....bummer. our drinks arrived and I kid you not, they were watered down. Not minorly...but totally blatantly obvious. Really? That annoyed me, but I was still hopeful that the food was good. We got the Bacon Gorgonzola Fondue...What a let down. The fondue lacked flavor, we actually had to add salt to it. I knew then that this meal was going to be bad. The meat was just average quality. They lacked flavor and the meats were fatty. The sauces they provide are as bland as the fondue. I was so unimpressed. Then dessert was next, The dessert was just ok. A meal for 2, with drinks cost $128.00 before tip. I could have been fully wined and dined at a top notch restaurant for that price. We won't be back again. And as I type this, my husband is in the bathroom yelling because he has awful cramps and diarrhea."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with exceptional service.  The waitstaff is trained very well and go out of of their way to walk you thru the whole experience. It is pricey but it is a special occasion place. Just be prepared to spend about two hours eating four courses. Nothing compares to the desert. It is out of this world. Ask for Cheandra. She rocks."}
{"text":"Love, love , love this place!!! The ambiance is incredible.  Staff is amazing. The food is beyond delicious.  The private booths makes a great date night."}
{"text":"We had the cheese & desert happy hour.. Awesome price, great food, and good service! Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Food is definitely overpriced. If I would have known that I was going to cook my own meal and spend close to $300,  I would have gone to Flemings, Donovans,  or other great steakhouses where I know the food and service was gonna be great. People tell me it's an experience I have to try it! I would rather cook a romantic dinner for my wife at home than have to cook my own food at a restaurant. In a nutshell, if IM going to she'll out a few hundred dollars at a restaurant I expect my food to be cooked and not have to cook it myself."}
{"text":"I would give this zero stars, except that's not an option.

Made reservations online for dinner on Friday March 15.  Drove 45 minutes from downtown Toronto, only to find a sign on the door that says \"Closed for inventory count\".

Are you kidding me?! It's a Friday night, they were taking reservations and it's not even month/year-end - and they're going to close the restaurant and not notify customers on the website or stop taking reservations?  I don't really believe that they were closed for inventory on a Friday night - that's just bad business practice especially not telling customers who made reservations...is this restaurant still open or has it gone out of business?  

Goes to show the kind of service you can expect, based on management's example, if you were to ever eat here

No thanks - I won't be trying again - I'll have better luck driving to Buffalo which is the next closest one.

Lesson learned - no more trecking to the 'burbs for a meal."}
{"text":"After a heavy brunch, we were looking for something light and new to try for dinner. Therefore, we decided to try cheese fondue at The Melting Pot. Firstly, we were truly disappointed at their service. We waited for awhile to be seated while the restaurant was half empty. And it took awhile for the server to come to our table and introduce the menu to us, not to mention that it took forever to find our server throughout the whole dinner. Also, she did not clearly explain the menu, misunderstood our questions and treated us in a rude manner.

As I mentioned, we were not very hungry. So we did not consider ordering any entree, especially when each entree was almost $30+ for each person, excluding the cheese fondue which was $11 per person. Therefore, we simply ordered the spinach artichoke cheese fondue. We were going to order the traditional swiss cheese fondue but the server said it is very heavy and then recommended the spinach artichoke cheese fondue. We decided to take her recommendation.

We assumed that entrees were real, cooked main course dishes as the server did not explain what an entree really is. It was not until we saw the next table then we realized that that entrees were actually uncooked seafood and meat which you would dip into the cheese and then cook it in there. If the server clearly explained them, we would have definitely tried them.


The server brought cheese, spinach, artichoke, tabasco and other ingredients to our table along with bread, tortilla chips, uncooked vegetables and granny smith apples for us to dip into the fondue. She prepared the cheese fondue by put all the ingredients into the pot until the cheese melted and all the ingredients were well-mixed.

The cheese fondue was actually very tasty. I am glad we took our server's advice and went with the rather light spinach artichoke cheese fondue. The spinach and artichoke added a new dimension to the fondue so it was not only cheese, cheese and cheese. It made it a lot tastier and less heavy. Half way into the fondue, the cheese became a lot thicker so we added water into the fondue. We think that the water actually helped to make it easier for us to dip the bread into the cheese and made it more yummy since the inside of the bread was able to absorb more cheese. It is also a bonus at The Melting Pot that you can refill your bread, chips etc. as long as there is cheese in your pot. We refilled like 2 times since there were 4 of us, but each time the portion became smaller and smaller.

One of the reason why we did not order any entrees was because we always wanted to try their chocolate fondue. We went for the pure dark chocolate fondue because after eating a few fondue in Montreal, we realized that the bitterness of dark chocolate actually helps to bring out the sweetness of the fruits you dip into the fondue. It is also less overwhelming.



Our chocolate fondue came with strawberries, pineapples, bananas, two different special marshmallows, cheesecakes and brownies. Although it sounded like a lot, it was not the case. The plate above was for two people; the portion was too small for two people and not worth the value of what you paid for. Overall, I don't think there was anything special about this chocolate fondue. It was very basic. If you have a few people, I would recommend you to do this at home. You will get even more fun than this.

Since we were really happy with the refill feature, we clearly asked the server is it the same where we can refill our fruits and stuff as long as there is still chocolate in the pot before ordering and she clearly said yes too! After spending 15 minutes looking for her and ask her for refills, she said no refills and each bowl of strawberry is $3. We were in shocked because we clearly asked and she clearly said yes. When we confronted her, she said she had never said that and she has worked here for 7 months and would not mislead us in a very rude manner.  She even said we have already eaten a 12 people portion of bread (but we refilled for two times only and the portion was really really small). We were really disappointed with the way she treated us.

conclusion: 

not roasted. 

I would say that if you have never tried cheese fondue, this is a good place to try it for once only. But I found it rather expensive for the small portion and for the services I got. For chocolate fondue, don't even think of this place. I think a lot of desserts restaurants do better than this."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. Try to go once a month. The big night out is pricy, but well worth it. I suggest upgrading the broth. Love the spinach and artichoke dip for the cheese and almost always get the bananas foster for the desert. The food is forst class and service is second to none. Aleays had a great experience. Join the club and get awesome offers via email."}
{"text":"Service is always great.  The staff seems to really enjoy working at this location which makes for a wonderful evening.  To say what is the best is difficult.  First the cheese is awesome, the shrimp and teriyaki sirloin to die for.  Then we died and went to chocolate heaven, what could be better I don't know.  Thank you Melting Pot."}
{"text":"Great place to come to celebrate a special occasion. Food was delicious and fun to cook. Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"We had yet another fabulous experience at my favorite dining place, The Melting Pot. Sean was our waiter and did a wonderful job. We were called in by the special, which more than fed the two of us. When you get a chance to go, make it a more intimate ordeal like we did and reserve a private booth. Thanks again for a tasty dinner and great ambiance."}
{"text":"i love this place and i love fondue.  the place is modern w/dark tones decorations.  if you can't get a table at this place, get the table at the bar.  the food is definitely worth it.  the reason why i love this place so much is that they have private booths which are situated away from the bigger tables and walking traffic.  I love how these booths are set up with corner seating, so your date and you can sit side by side for a more romantic and intimate dinner.   
 
the last time i was here, my FABULOUS date and i enjoyed the \"Big Night\" option on the menu.  i also ordered a bottle of some the sweet champagne (Asti Spumante) from Martini and Rossi.  we started off with bread cubes, vegatables, and apples to dip in the traditional  swiss cheese fondue melted right in front of us.  this was followed by a strawberry -almond salad, which used the sweetness of strawberries to accent the tangy balsamic vinegar.  for our entree we ordered the lobster Indulgence, which included lobster tails, beef sirloin, black tiger shrimp, citrus-marinated pork tenderloin, breast of chicken, and whew some roasted vegetable ravioli to dip in a special broth.  i loved all the different tons of dipping sauces, because i just love to dip those little bastards of lobsters, beef, or chicken into some tasty tangy flavors.   we finished it off with the tropical coconut rum chocolate fondue.  i really wanted to dip a spoon in there and just eat it straight out of the pot.  it came with a plate of bananas, marshmallows, pound cake, strawberries, pineapple chunks, brownies and cheesecake.  actually, if it were allowed i would have liked to dip my date in it, too....ooh yummy!!! 

yeah, this meal was pretty good, and pretty heavy on the stomach.  i would recommend to go light on the appetizer, maybe skip the salad, try the entree, but it is a must to make it to the dessert!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the most overrated things I have done in a while.  I will give it two stars because the dessert was good but for what you pay the food is really lacking.

The cost is really high and you cook your own plate!  If the cost was about in half it would have gotten three or four stars.

On top of that it seemed we were always waiting for the raw foods to show up."}
{"text":"Can be pricey as it is a 4 course experience. It was quite pleasant when I went. My date and I got a booth with drapes, it was romantic she said. A flight of wine each, which was not exorbitantly priced. Do plan to spend some time here, it can be a lot of food (some items are bottomless, I recommend extra apples with the cheese). Wish we could have combined the cheese and entree portion to eat at once! Probably can, our booth only had a single range though. I'll be back for another date night."}
{"text":"Great Customer Service!
Went to this location for a special occasion. Had a $100.00 gift card to use. Had a very good meal with excellent service.when the bill came we used the gift card. Our server came back and said the card would not scan and the number could not be read for manual entry. We spoke to the manager who was most accommodating giving us a portion of the credit. He suggested that we contact the corporate office and explain the situation to them . I did exactly that. My inquiry was assigned to Dru Lundy. I ended up sending the card to them. After his follow up he replied that he would send us a replacement card for full value.. I would highly this recommend this location and really applaud the corporate office for their customer service. This restaurant gets it!!

{"text":"WOW!!!I have never had a better experience in my life . The food here was great. The service was impeccable , and the price was reasonable . Though the idea of cooking your own food was creative unlike other places I know, it made me uneasy and cautious of the food disease ecoli. Besides that I have nothing else against your restaurant. I am looking forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"For small parties, this place is fine... large parties(10) is a different story... so horrible, I will never come here again.  2.5 hours later, we just got our dessert... it will probably be another 30-45 min before they can figure out how to put a check together.  After the check, I will have to drive to a store to get some water, they don't know how to provide any here."}
{"text":"We arrived at our reservation time and waited for 23 minutes to be sat down.  A 4 person group who arrived after us without reservations was sat before we us.  When they finally decided to seat us, we were put in a bad corner table which apparently didn't include any service. Sat there for 5 minutes without service before finally deciding to walk out.  This is my girl's favorite restaurant and we usually eat here 2-3 times per year but we will not go back, not ever.  

If you are debating on whether or not to visit this restaurant, I would say go to one of the many other great options in the Arrowhead area to include P83 and Bell road."}
{"text":"My husband got us a \"package deal\" for a date night. It came with a photo w/ frame of us, 12 roses, and a private booth. It was the first time either of us had been there and I loved it. The food was good. The drinks were great. And the experience was awesome. It was a bit pricey but for everything we got it was worth it."}
{"text":"The restaurant . com tour continues - we did one of their combo seafood meat, veggie, dessert thingy's. tried a berry mojito - boring, boring boring. 

everything was ok but man o man, they give you way too many dipping sauces - one was for meat, one for veggies, one for meat and veggies - blah blah blah ! 

the dessert platter made the day - had some sort of chocolate turtle liquor fondue - they give you fruits, cookies, marshmallows, cake, cheesecake , maybe it was an off night because our platter didn't include the mini-kitchen sink ! 

would i do this place again - i kinda have to - got a coupon for the charleston location but 2 times now i've gone and they were booked - geez, didn't think the concept was all that !"}
{"text":"This is the best place to go out for a date! The food is just amazing!! We got the all you can eat and it was just terrific! And of course we finished with desert. The banana foster is the best"}
{"text":"Had the traditional four course meal to celebrate my anniversary.  Service was outstanding.  I ordered a glass of wine and really didn't like it - they took it back and didn't charge me for my replacement glass of wine.  The server said it was on the house - they didn't like that I was disappointed with my first choice.  For dessert they provided a nice dessert wine so we could toast our anniversary.  

The food was tasty - I enjoyed the pace of entrees and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Horrible food, horrible service and overpriced especially when we had to cook our own food! There was only 3 of us, dinner and a couple drinks and we walked out the door owing $225."}
{"text":"GOOD: GOOD SERVICE - NICE SETTING
BAD: OVERPRICED - AVERAGE FOOD - SLOW SERVING

It is my very first time writing on Yelp and I just wanted to say it was a big disappointment for me as a fondue lover. 
I didn't try their dessert last time because the food wasn't that good. 
I and my friend didn't want to stay there any longer anyways since our main was served exactly 1 hour and 30 min after we ordered!!
Cheese fondue came first and then we had to wait 40 min until the next one was served.
Their service is good- if you are not happy with what you ordered, they're willing to replace it with something else. 
Some ppl say their chocolate fondue is good so maybe it's a place for dessert.
But their foods are way over priced.. I and my friend ordered 1 cheese fondue, which was $18 with some bread and a few chopped pieces of vegetables, and 2 main dishes, which was around $25 each. Each dish comes with raw beef and chicken chopped into 4-5 tiny pieces and 5-6 tiger shrimps. Is it enough for 1 person? NO. 
You probably think it's what's usually served in fine dining. I've been to a lot of fine dining restaurants but firstly the dish isn't served cooked. Secondly Melting Pot is not a fine dining restaurant. I'm quite confused about their positioning in market if they are targeting high-end gourmets who are willing to pay $50 per person for a casual dinner because their foods are not that great."}
{"text":"Even though the experience was a delight, I don't think I will be coming back here. 

Overall, I did not feel it was worth it to pay the price of $86/2 people for something I can make at home. The cheese fondue was nice, but accompanied with chopped up apples and bread.. it should not cost so much. 

The meat platter with your choice of cooking style was a disappointment. I do not see the point of dipping already marinated meat into a broth that would just wash away the flavor. The meat ended up kind of bland and very rough (as you would expect from boiled meat). 

My favorite part of the meal is the dessert - we ordered the flaming turtle fondue, and it was delicious! However, I'd like to point out again.. not worth it for the price. I'd prefer spending this money on a nice steak house."}
{"text":"Finding the location was a little tricky.  Front of business is not visible from anywhere but the back parking lot or center walking area.  
Upon entering, hubub and I were warmly greeted and asked to wait at the bar while our table was prepared.  Had time to wash up before they took us to the table.  Quick!
This place is a maze.  We were taken towards the back to a super private area and seated at a tiny little booth made for two to be seated VERY closely.  There's even a little curtain they can close to make it nice and private.  Super romantic.
Service was impeccable.  
I would give it 4 stars had it not been for the outrageous prices.  (luckily we had a Living Socia deal).  
For the price, I would have expected higher quality food, however, portions of the entrees were endless.  
Dessert is a must.  Ate myself into a food coma

I will return if Living Social or Groupon comes out with another deal for this location.

If your looking for an expensive meal and a romantic setting, your better off going to the Compass Grill in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"After hearing people rave about this place, finally got to check it out for a friend's birthday. This location is kind of hard to find...GPS got me to the parking lot of an insurance company and then I wandered for about 5 minutes before finding it. Second, it took a while to get food. It was tasty, but seemed pretty expensive for me dipping things in cheese and chocolate. On a positive note, our server was pretty good, high 5 for Sean! Since gift cards were on sale, I'll be going back...but the total for 8 of us was $350."}
{"text":"so it was tough to decide what rating to give  this place. i HATE their main entrees. its like you cook ur own food in broth and theres no taste yuck.
but i am a HUGE HUGE fan of the cheese and chocolate they have here.
its total fondue style so  if you get spinach and artichoke the waiter(ess) will come and put the cheese spinach and the little things that make it taste good and after it melts u eat it with apples veggies breads etc. i always get scared to ask for more bread and such but theyre really nice about it.
the same goes with the chocolate. i think i found my new favorite Banana Foster. it was absolutely amazing.  the chocolate comes with  pound cake cheese cake overly sweet marshmellows with cookie crumbs on it and fruit.
i feel like the cheese and chocolate are really reasonable saying you can share it with others. i wish the food was as good though and not a complete rip off. because trust me i could walk to vons and make my own nastyly broth chickena nd steak for way less then 30 bucks.

but the chocolate and cheese again win me over =)"}
{"text":"The idea for this place is nice, but I don't think I'll come here again. When I had dinner here with my boyfriend we left the place hungry and simply content. We ordered the  full course that included the salad, appetizer, main, and dessert. We, also, got the yin yang alcoholic beverage which was the most impressive thing we ordered that night. The cheese mixture just wasn't very impressive and we felt like there wasn't enough dipping items to fill us up. When it came to the dessert we found that the best items were the fruits (strawberries, bananas, raspberries, and blackberries) and pound cakes. The others tasted mediocre. I'm not telling anyone not to try this place out. It is a very good experience, the servers are exceptional, and the ambiance is very romantic. I found this place to be more of a social environment where I would go on a first date or to catch up with friends rather than a place to enjoy food."}
{"text":"This is a must-try place for cheese fanatics! I was so happy that there was a new cheese fondue place in town, and finally this US chain has hit the GTA! If you love cheese, there's no reason not to go here - it's the perfect place to indulge in cheesy goodness, a unique experience with friendly and attentive service, and good classy atmosphere to hang out with friends. 

I ordered 2 cheese fondue pots amongst my group of 5. I chose the Winsconsin Trio Cheese Fondue, however, it had a VERY strong alcohol taste to it. It was still good but not my personal preference as it overpowered the taste of cheese (good if you like your liquor though!). As suggested by our server, the Spinach Artichoke Cheese Fondue was the way to go, even if you don't like veggies! I highly recommend this one!  

Overall, the experience is very interesting (they make the cheese fondue in front of you from scratch, let it heat & mix, which was cool) and it's a good snack place if you're with a group of friends and want to share a bite. I didn't try any of their entrees and seeing as they specialize in fondues - I'd stick to that."}
{"text":"I was wanting to come here for at least 10 years finally got in Pretty cool little place for what it is lot of  private  Booths  For place to go hang out your friends it works I wanted the hatch chili cheese which is really good learned a new combination green apples and cheese super good For the entree I ordered steak salmon and shrimp did not care for any of it would never order the entree   For dessert order the  Pecan  Chocolate in Carmel that was OK If I go next time I will sit in the bar for the cheese fundu for almost half the price that's a good deal it experience restaurant so you pay for we paid 150 for three people and we were still hungry"}
{"text":"Yum!! I had never had fondue before tonight.  We went with the 4 course experience and wow what a feast. Started with the Wisconsin cheddar, salad, steak entrée and the Flaming Turtle for dessert.... A great way to celebrate a birthday."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, however the waiter was terrible! The hostess and the bus boy did better than our waiter Andres. The host knew it was our anniversary and made us feel welcome. Our waiter was slow and was never around. 2 other couple were celebrating their anniversary and the other a birthday; I'm which both sat down 10 minutes after us. We received our drinks and each course last compared to everyone else around us. My wife and I wish we sat in the other waitresses area to get her great service. She brought out special anniversary/birthday candles.

We'll be back, but we will refuse to be sat with Andres.

{"text":"Save yourself the money. Nothing here can't be completed in the kitchen of your own house provided you have basic peanut butter and jelly skills. This place is great if you're a pretentious, entitled couple."}
{"text":"I went to try this place out on a Monday, Memorial Day, the last day for Arizona Restaurant Week.  I have never tried fondue and this gave me a great opportunity.

The deal was choose from a cheddar or cheese artichoke fondue for the starter, a the main course fondue, and the classic or dark chocolate fondue for dessert.  All this for 30 bucks per person and add 6.95 for the cooking style.

The place was dark and was playing classic music from the fabulous fifties.  The place was just the opposite of busy.  I really did not even need to make a reservation.  

On with the food.  The spinach cheese artichoke was creamy and thick.  Croutons, tortilla chips, cauliflower, apples were dipped and savoured.  Highly recommend.  

The main course consisted of about 4 pieces of sirloin teriyaki, pork, chicken breast, 2 spinach ravioli, and shrimp.  We chose the Coq Au Vin cooking style that had wine, mushrooms, and broccoli.  Cooking them was such an adventure.  Something about dipping a stick in a hot metal bowl so simple yet so interactive.  The \"stew\" really did its job of just cooking the food.  The total time to cook each meaty piece was around 2-3 minutes.  The six different dressings were what really gave the zest.  We also got  a lobster tail with lemon butter dipping sauce for an added 10 bucks.  It was worth it because how often do people ever eat lobster fondue?

The chocolate fondue dessert was delicious because I have a sweet tooth, but unremarkable.  Rice crispies, a slice of cheesecake, giant marshmellows, bannana slices, and strawberries were among the dippers.

The total bill was 60pp, even with the restuarant week discount.  But, the experience and the attentiveness of the waitress compensated for it overall.  I compare the fondue for the main course to be similar to \"Hot Pot\" because of table top cooking, but the food fusion is much different.

I recommend this place for date night or a special occasion.  It is quiet enough to carry conversations.  Other than that happy hour is the other time I would ever come here because of the prices."}
{"text":"Went to celebrate the kids' birthdays - mentioned that with the reservation - and nothing special for them. Asked for a sample of wine before deciding on one since they are ridiculously overpriced. Sample was generous; included someone else's lipstick on the glass! Yuck. Waiter was disappointingly not very apologetic. But then he wasn't really attentive either. We had to ask for napkins - after getting our food - and waited, and waited. We stole some from the table next to us and when he saw us unwrapping them to put on our laps, he mentioned something about forgetting them and only brought bar napkins. Hmmm. I expect better from this place, especially at those prices. 

Also, had we not been there before, we wouldn't have known you can get more dessert pieces to finish up your chocolate. Our waiter certainly didn't offer up that info. And the last time we went with two adults and two kids, they charged us for two total desserts. Last night, for all four of us. Sorry, but the kids didn't each eat $8.95 worth of dessert."}
{"text":"Would have been a FIVE...but we had a kinda inexperienced server...of course everyone has to start somewhere! Endless entries ROCK!"}
{"text":"They insisted that my party of 7 EACH buy a meal that easily feeds 3 - when the table only has two burners. On top of that, they're high priced meals. They said they called everyone and let them know, but they didn't specify that EVERY PERSON needed to buy one - and they were doing this because it was Xmas Eve and they were busy. Nice try - no one was in there. Merry Xmas I guess. Looks like the manager would rather let a party of 7 walk out"}
{"text":"This place is always amazing. It is expensive but I feel like its worth it. We always get the fiesta cheese and the flaming turtle chocolate and they are always on point. Service is always friendly and manager always comes to the table to ask how everything was. They always have new things on the menu to try so thats always nice. We come here for anniversaries and other special events and when they find out they always do something nice for us!"}
{"text":"Melting pot is good for once in a while. However I wouldn't go there too many times either. The cuisine becomes repetitive very fast."}
{"text":"This place has a funny smell to it. The food was ok. Kind of pricy for what you get. The best part was the dessert. If I go back it will be just for that."}
{"text":"First time went with my two daughters , we had an awesome time , we didn't have a reservation but the super sweet hostest she made sure we were seated really fast and we had the best experience 
Service was great Joey was fast knowledgeable and awesome 

We got the 4 course meal 
Fiesta cheese was a favorite 
As well as the flaming turtle 

Can't wait to make another date nite here"}
{"text":"Andy was amazing. He runs the bar like a pro and made some great recommendations. Out of all the melting pots, this is the only one I come to. Clean, quiet ambiance."}
{"text":"Never a big fan of Fondue but The Melting Pot is a nice surprise.  It was clean and staff was friendly.  We ordered the Spinach Artichoke Cheese fondue and the chocolate smores fondue.  The Cheese fondue was pretty good with the nachos, bread, carrots, veggies and green apple.   The dessert was kind of sweet even for my standard and I love sugar.  But I did manage to finish it all.  The chocolate fondue came with strawberries (best part), pineapples, 2 graham crackers(which was kind of stale), 2 brownies pieces, 2 pound cake, bananas, 2 type of different type of covered marshmallow (my least favour) and 1 decent size cheesecake.  They have a special on Tuesday for half the price so I will def return on Tuesday to try another flavor next time.  It was a fun and interesting experience."}
{"text":"Do Swiss Army Knives have a fondue fork that folds
away into the knife? They should. While nobody yodelled
for us this definitely is the place for lovers of cheese
and chocolates. Everybody kept asking what was being 
celebrated. For the price of the meal it sure seems like
you need a reason to splurge to even walk through the
door. We all had a pretty good time regardless. I'm not
sure if all locations are like this but you probably 
want to make a reservation if you are coming in on a weekend.
  So the most popular way of enjoying a meal at The Melting
Pot is the four course deal. You get cheese fondue, salad,
an Entree and dessert (chocolate fondue). I must say that
for a lot of people by the time the third course is done, 
that is pretty much it. You can tone down the amount of food
to fit the actual amount your group can handle eating. Even
if you have four people in your group, you can order the salads
for 2 or the entrees for 3. That helps a lot in terms of
portion control. When I was there, even the final dessert which 
we ordered for one seemed to be a lot. 
   So you start off with a cheese fondue - you can choose from
Spinach Artichoke (Fontina and Butterkase with spinach and
artichoke hearts), Fiesta Cheese (aged cheddar with lager beer, 
japaleno peppers and salsa), Cheddar Cheese (aged cheddar and
Emmenthaler Swiss with lager beer, garlic, and seasonings),
Wisconsin Trio Cheese (Fontina and Butterkase with buttermilk
bleu cheese, white wine, scallions, and sherry), Traditional
Swiss Cheese (Gruyere and Emmenthaler Swiss with white wine, 
garlic, nutmeg, lemon and Kirschwasser) and finally the Big
Night Out Seasonal Cheese. The waiter comes and sets up a fondue
pot and mixes the cheese and all the ingredients which you can
then dip breads, fresh vegetables and apples into. This is sort
of like an appetizer so there's only one plate for everyone to 
get items to dip from. 
   Then you have a choice of salads for the second course - The
Melting Pot House Salad, Spinach Mushroom Salad, Caesar Salad,
California Salad, and Big Night Out Salad. These are rather big
portions for a salad so if you have a small capacity you might
want to share rather than have each person getting their own salad.
   Then we get to the entrees. This is the fun part because you
do your own cooking. First, you have to choose a cooking style.
Pretty much one for the whole group. You can choose from Coq au
Vin (Burgundy wine with fresh herbs, spices, and mushrooms), Court
Bouillon (vegetable broth with herbs and spices), Bourguignonne
(cholestrol-free canola oil), and Mojo (bouillon with fresh garlic
and citrus). For the entrees themselves, you have all sorts of 
combinations of filet mignon, shrimp, salmon, chicken, sirloin,
pork tenderloin, duck, potstickers, ravioli, asparagus, tofu, 
edamame, artichoke hearts, Andouille sausage, onion rings, lobster
tail, and Portobello mushrooms.
   The cooking times were given for each type of food:
Poultry, Pork: 2 1/2 minutes
Seafood: 2 minutes
Beef: 1 1/2 minutes
Everything else: 1 minute
   I used my iPhone's timer and used both fondue forks at a time
to try and get the cooking down to a science. A little silly and
fun at the same time. But by the end of it, I was stuffed. Our
group decided we'd have only one person's portion of the final
course - dessert. 
   For the final course, chocolate fondue (dessert) you get a 
choice of Big Night Out Seasonal Chocolate, The Original (milk
chocolate, peanut butter), Yin & Yang (dark and white chocolate),
Cookies 'n Cream Marshmallow Dream (dark chocolate topped with
marshmallow cream flambeed and topped with Oreo cookies), Flaming
Turtle (milk chocolate, caramel and candied pecans flambéed), Pure
Chocolate (dark, white, or milk), Bananas Foster (Bananas and a 
hint of cinnamon swirled in white chocolate), and Chocolate S'mores
(milk chocolate with marshmallow cream, flambéed and topped with 
bits of graham crackers). We opted for the Cookies 'n Cream Marshmallow
Dream. They brought a plate of strawberries, bananas, cheesecake, Rice 
Krispies Treats, marshmallows, pound cake and brownies to dip in.
It was definitely decadent and filled us all to the brim.
   Parking is easy to find. It's in the same mall as Zendejas Grill and 
Next Coffee. The restaurant itself is right across from Sylvan."}
{"text":"Had a very lovely 2 hour anniversary dinner. We chose the 4 course French Quarter meal. Our server was very patient when we couldn't decide which cheese we wanted so he made a special one to suit us both. It was awesome. The salad was tasty too. Then the entree came and that was fun to work with. We had the Mojo cooking style with Cajun style seafood, it was delicious. Dessert was excellent! Overall we had a very good time having fun with our food. Definitely recommending it for a good date night/anniversary thing for those who are somewhat adventurous."}
{"text":"When we were done with the meal the plates sat for quite a while little disappointed other than that I would definitely go again just be more prompt I'm cleaning the table"}
{"text":"Loved our dinner last night! We had a 4 course meal and it was perfect. Excellent service and friendly staff, clean restaurant, clean bathrooms. 
First, this place can be hard to find. If you use a GPS, keep in mind the entrance is on the inside of the plaza it takes you to so you have to get out and walk to see it. It's on the back corner of the plaza. 
The cheese fondue was mixed right at the table, so you know it's not cheese that's sitting in the kitchen and then gets heated up. It was amazing.
The salad was fine, but not necessary as the rest of the food was already a lot. 
The main entree was a mixture of chicken, sirloin, filet mignon and shrimp. We went with the basic bouillon to cook in. Keep in mind a 4 course dinner easily lasts 2 hours. You cool your own meat, and they bring potatoes and veggies to cook with it. It takes time, but that's part of the fun. Instead of being served food 15 minutes after walking in you have time to talk and enjoy the evening. 
The chocolate fondue was to die for. It is worth going here just for that. We chose the s'mores fondue and he mixed the marshmallow with the chocolate right at the table. All chocolate fondue comes with an assortment of strawberry, pineapple, banana, cake, Rice Krispie treats, brownies, blondies, marshmallow and crackers. It was amazing. For $9 it's worth stopping sometime just for that (it is included in the 4 course dinner however). 
I posted pictures of everything. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This dining experience is just not worth what it costs. 3 adults, 2 kids (10 and 12) and the bill was  over $200. Yes, it was interesting; yes the kids had fun cooking their own food (and fishing out dropped tidbits with the \"search and rescue\" slotted spoon)  and yes the food was fresh and we were ultimately filled up. Our waitress (an attractive, personable and attentive blond) patiently explained the menu and the \"process\" for dipping and cooking. I liked that there were separate plates for raw food and cooked food. With the long sharp fondue forks a potential hazard (eyes!) and the electric cooktop right in the middle of the table I would advise NO CHILDREN UNDER 7. What you are paying for is the \"experience\" of cooking your own pre-cut up food...hmmm?!!! Going for cocktails and just the cheese fondue might be worth it...especially if it was a romantic encounter in one of the curtained booths. Or maybe just the chocolate fondue for dessert. Also...whoever heard of boiling filet mignon?... which is how the main course entree selections were cooked. I go way back to the fondue heydays of the 70's...our fondue pots for steak were pots of sizzling seasoned hot oil. Yum! I do realize boiled broth is healthier but come on... steak shouldn't be boiled! We left full, had fun as a family so maybe it was worth it after all! 12 year old said it was the best (said after dipping marshmallows in chocolate!) i just think there are so many other places for better food at more reasonable prices. And if you are going somewhere special for a special occasion eat somewhere else first then stop in at The Melting Pot for dessert!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here for our anniversary, the staff made it very special for us! Love the privacy of the booths and the unique interactive experience! The lobster in the Caribbean infused broth was amazing! Worth the price for that most special occasion!"}
{"text":"I took my friend here for a nice evening out for her birthday.  I have been here before but only for dessert.  The first course was a Caesar salad which was great. But then again how can you really mess up a salad.  However, the Parmesan encrusted pine nuts added a little character. 

The second course consisted of cheese dip and which I thought I had a little more beer and garlic than I liked.  But the meats, especially the summer sausage, made up for that inconvenience. 

The third course was a little underwhelming for me.  There were a multiple options to choose from on the platter including filet minon, teriyaki beef, chicken, shrimp and ravioli.  My favorite was by far the teriyaki beef.  It was very good with the various dipping sauces.  The wort part of this was having to cook the meat.  There are small pieces that each you need to cook and it gets annoying fishing for the meat.

Lastly, we had our dessert which consisted of brownies, strawberries, cheesecake, bananas and rice crispy treats to be dipped in our chocolate snickers fondue.  Every part this was delicious.

This is a great place to visit at least once for the full experience with all the courses.  However, i will only go back for dessert. Great service but 3 stars because of the price and having to cook the food yourself."}
{"text":"If you love fondue this is the place for you.  Go straight for the cheese and chocolate and skip the 4 course meal.  They have a great happy hour in the bar so this is the best time to go."}
{"text":"Good experience and fun. Good service no issues.

Pros: service, choice, a lot of food, atmosphere

Cons: price especially wines.  Very strong fish odor when you enter"}
{"text":"Let me start this by saying that our waitress was really great and tried her best to help us, for her I would give five stars. 

Our experience, however, was pretty strange and highly unsatisfactory. 

Here's what went down.....so it's New Years Eve and we weren't really planning on going out but we were getting hungry and I thought it would be nice to do something simple and low key. We weren't hungry enough for a full meal so I thought an appetizer and dessert would suffice and I thought e melting pot would be perfect for that. I called at 7 and made a reservation for 9pm. No information was given at the time of any promotions or events for the evening so I thought everything was on track for what I wanted. We got to the restaurant right on time and we seated in less than five minutes. When we  were given the menus we were told that they had a New Years Eve dinner with a set price. I told the waitress we really only wanted the cheese and chocolate fondue. She stated that unfortunately they wouldn't be able to do that and gave a few minutes to look over the menu. When she came back, I asked if the two of us could split one dinner, since we weren't looking to eat a whole entree.  The waitress said she wasn't supposed to that, but she would allow it. She then also mentioned that she had talked to her manager who said that we could do cheese and chocolate at the bar. This sounded perfect and so we grabbed our stuff and followed her back to the bar area. Just as we were sitting down, the manager came up and said they aren't serving only cheese and chocolate this evening. He was so rude about it that we ended up leaving. I was more than willing to pay for one meal and only take the cheese and chocolate, which would mean I was over paying by almost 50%. I was also willing to only choose the cheese and chocolate options listed on the special menu. We were dressed very nicely and had money we would've gladly spent on what we were wanting. Had we been told that it was prix fixe for the evening I wouldn't of made the reservation. But since we were there I thought it would be in a restaurants interest to accommodate a patron who states that they want to buy something. Surely something could've been arranged but we were so rudely handled that I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"Our kids gave us a gift card for $120 for this place. We checked reviews and thought maybe we could squeeze two trips in for this amount. Boy were we wrong!  The meal for two was just over the $120 with tip and we don't drink. WHAT A ROYAL RIP OFF. The food wasn't even that good. To add insult to injury both of us were down the next day with stomach problems. Would not consider going again if we were offered a free meal."}
{"text":"Very great alternative to the normal food choices around North Phoenix.  Very nice atmosphere, cool air con."}
{"text":"Chris/kris is the best waiter there. She made the night so much fun and helped us with our fondue selections. Everything was so delicious. Making this our new regular spot."}
{"text":"Chocolate? We're there. I wanted to share a fondue experience with my daughter. The first time, we had the works: cheese course, meat course and chocolate, of course. We overate and decided to be smarter the next time.

The next time we ate, we decided to skip the meat course because dipping meats into broth did not quite appeal to as. The meat was too chunky unlike Asian hot-pot which entails cooking raw meat in robust broths. We were not disappointed with the Alpine cheese course and of course the dessert white and mike chocolate fondue. Which came out in an adorable yin and yang design. We died and went to heaven, again! This time, we did not overeat and felt much better. To top it off, our bartender was good looking and service with awesome."}
{"text":"The Melting pot finally opened up an East Side location not more than a couple years ago and still one must make a reservation to eat here at any normal dinner hour. There are on line reservations you can make which I highly suggest. 
Once you get to melting pot, obviously know that dinner will take two and a half to three hours. I always try to make it quicker and it never really works. The fondue is always consist ant here. I can only recommend what I have had, and I always stick to the basics, cheese, wine based fondue for meat and yummy dark chocolate. This is always good!!! You Will Be Full..."}
{"text":"I really wanted the melting pot to be as good as always...it was ok. The server Ivan was very good in all areas. The food was ok.. The overall flavor was just not there tonight. Everything seemed just a bit off. Now for the real issue. We understood that the only menu available even though tonight is February 16th was the Valentine's Day menu. We were perfectly OK with that. We asked our server very specific questions and were given clear answers. We appreciated that. We were charged $14.00 too much. The Phone just rang and it was Tony from the melting pot. I sent them an e-mail about 15 mins ago on this situaton. EXCELLENT turnaround time ! Problem taken care of. This makes us willing to return again. Honest mistake and honest correction. Thank you to The Melting Pot. We will give you another chance."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant for a few years. Finally we came for my birthday; party of 3. We had an 8 o'clock reservation and weren't seated until 815. To keep this brief, the food was good but it took 3 hrs for dinner. We waited for all 4 courses but the main course we waited what may have been 45 minutes for. I'm pretty sure my husband was ready to leave not finishing the meal. The waitress was friendly but it wasn't enough to make up for the slow service. We are never going back. Plus dinner was very pricey all things considered."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see this American chain come to Canada! I went and checked it out on a Friday night a couple weeks ago. My best friend and I went and it was both of our first nights out since we had our babies this spring. So we didn't want to be disappointed. And we weren't! We ended up having a great meal and great time.

We started with a drink. My friend had the Appletini and I had the Smores martini. Both were pretty good! They were very strong but not throat-burningly strong. And no ice cubes in our martinis either (the worst). We decided to do the Big Night Out In America meal which gives you a chance to eat and try everything for two. Having never been to the Melting Pot before, we found the menu a bit baffling and literally needed our server's help in figuring out how it worked. You are allowed to change up the BNO menu to any of the fondue options on the menu and we changed our cheese fondue to the Wisconsin Cheese Trio. 

Our server made everything at the table for us. She was excellent about telling us what she was putting in but I think she should have spent more time blending everything because until we gave our cheese a BIG stir, it was extremely alcohol-y. It came with bread and some apples. The bread was dry but really, the cheese masked that. It was really delicious. We sat there doing the 'cheese moan' for a bit--the \"omg mmmm\" sound. The server continued to be thoughtful and did little things like give us lots of fondue forks.

Next we did the salads, the Wisconsin Wedge for me and the California salad for my friend. The dressing on my salad tasted a bit like bottled ranch. I sincerely hope it's not bottled ranch because that's a major black mark, IMO. My friend's salad was excellent but it was DROWNED in dressing. Sadly, the salads needed a bit of work. They were not bad and we both ate them completely but they were very boring. 

For our main course, we did the fondue feast minus the pork in the Mojo cooking style. We left our raw meats in the fondue for a lot longer than the server instructed, we were paranoid about making sure we cooked it thoroughly. I still enjoyed it and we both thought the oricchieti were amazing. The seasoning really just comes off the food in the fondue so I don't much see the point of it. The cooking liquid was tart and flavorful. Maybe a bit too much lime but overall, we had fun and we liked our food. We also got very full.

Lastly, we did the yin-yang chocolate fondue. It came with just about every sweet thing you could want--brownies, cheesecake, marshmallow, strawberries, pineapple, banana and this was BY FAR the best part of the night. Chocolate-gasm. We would have licked the pot if we could. 

Overall, I enjoyed everything and would absolutely go back. However, for what you get it's NOT cheap. We paid about $70 per person with just one drink each and tip. For a place where you cook all your own food, that's a lot. It's way overpriced in my opinion. I don't mind paying for good food but I don't like feeling a bit ripped off. That being said, you do leave feeling very full. The service was great but very slow. Our server was gone a lot between courses, not checking on us and even though we were rushing through dessert and paid our bill before our dessert was done (we had to get home to our babies, LOL), it still took us about 3 hours to have this meal. Had we taken our time through dessert, we could have easily added another 30 minutes to that time. So make sure you have a TON of time to spend here. 

The one thing I need to really criticize is the decor. I LOVE the privacy but the decor is awful. It's all beige and grey and sterile. Almost hospital-like. It was also FREEZING in there. We were sitting under a vent and it was uncomfortably cold. 

I like this place. I'd like to go back with my husband soon. It's a novelty and a fun experience with good food. Nothing crazy gourmet but definitely a great place and an interesting chain restaurant. It'd be excellent for a date. This is not a kid friendly place. Those crazy hot liquids could spell disaster for a rambunctious child or even a kid (or adult) who accidently knocks something over.

EDITED (March 24/13): This place is CLOSED. A friend of mine and I tried to go here last night and there's a sign that says \"Closed for Inventory\" but it's pitch black and mail is piling up in their front area. Apparently it's been dark for over a week. Just checked their website and it's listed as Closed there as well. Goodbye, Melting Pot :-( Bummer. Hubby hated it but it was great for girl's nights. Will have to go to the Buffalo location if I ever want it again, I guess."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time, after years of wanting to check it out.  It was our \"It's a boy\" celebration for my husband and myself.  We were placed in a little private booth with a curtain. Our waiter explained everything wonderfully, especially since it was our first time. We talked through the whole dinner about what a romantic experience this was. I do not have one complaint about any of the food, all of it, especially the desert was great.  We will be back for those special celebrations in our lives because we know this is the place to be :)"}
{"text":"Apparently melting pot won't do just chocolate and cheese tonight. Four course meals only and they tell you that after you've been sat. Made a reservation days ago and no mention of  these required meals. It's now, not surprising why your restaurant is empty on Mother's Day and why you have tons of reservations still available. So thanks for ruining Mother's Day with your nasty used car salesman bait and switch scheme."}
{"text":"We were a table of 4.  Sonny was our server and she was truly amazing!  She explained everything in great detail as this was our first time.  The food was outstanding and the service was as well. Our drinks were always full and we always had refills on our food.  The ONLY thing, and I repeat the ONLY thing that we didn't like was the ridiculous price!  I could've had 2 weeks worth of groceries for my family for the price we paid.  The food was great quality and great service, but the price is out of this world high.  I will ONLY go back on a very very special occasion.  It was very fun and enjoyable, however!"}
{"text":"Yikes!  Our party of 7 dined here for the first time.  The menu was complex and the waiter was either inexperienced or incompetent, resulting in a completely messed up order, or misunderstanding or bewilderment on our part.  The servings were sparse and the cuisine indifferent, or odd!  Then we got the bill.. holy Moley!  We could have made two car payments with the Verizon bill thrown in.
Don't recommend it.

 All in all...  wouldn't wish the experience on anyone but the Grinch!"}
{"text":"Visited the Melting Pot about a week ago with another couple. My husband and I hadn't been there before, but our friends raved about it often.

They did the ordering for us since we were newbies, and I must say everything was mighty tasty. The menu they give you appears quite complex at first glance, but the waiter was happy to explain the process to us. Generally, each individual can choose an appetizer, a meat, a salad, and a dessert if you utilize their dinner option. Let me say that that option includes a LOT of food for one person.

We four (all fairly larger eaters) shared two of the entree specials and it was plenty between us. We started with a classic cheddar cheese fondue, which is made from scratch before your very eyes on the table. Beer, seasonings, fresh grated cheese, and voila! Each person has their own set of color coded spears to stab bread or veggies onto and then dip into the communal bowl of cheese. I can't complain. Really, who could? Melty cheese. Bread.

It's ALMOST pizza.... almost.

For the second course, we had two normal sized salads delivered to the table. Again, we 4 were sharing two complete meals. I sampled the spinach apple salad, which was delicious. 

The 3rd course couldn't come fast enough. We were ravenous wolves, thick saliva hanging out the edges of our lips as we glanced about our secluded corner, trident gripped firmly in hands as wheezy breaths forced their way out of our noses, puff after forced puff....  The waiter arrived with the necessary mixings to form a boiling broth in the communal pot, and two plates of entirely, unquestionable raw meat. We shared the Classic plate and the Meat Lovers plate. These were comprised of an assortment of chicken, filet mignon, teriyaki beef, and shrimp. Along with the meats came potatoes and mushrooms and squash. 

A tip - Put the potatoes into the broth immediately to begin cooking. They take forever. No one likes crunchy potatoes. NO ONE!

So, each of us now pounding our tridents on the table in a fury, we were invited to spear pieces of meat and use each of the 3 tools we were provided to cook them. They suggest 1-2 minutes per piece, in the broth, on average.

As you can imagine, meat is delicious. For the price, I wondered why I wasn't at home just boiling meat on my own stove to eat. I guess the ambiance is worth the price? The experience? At any rate, I don't need to explain to you how the meat came out. It was good, but nothing over the top considering what it is in its basic form. 

The dessert was what I was excited for. So many choices!! I believe there were about ten options to share between the table. I mean, you all pretend to agree on one option, and that's what the table is served. I chose a white chocolate creme brulee. The waiter burned a layer of sugar on the top before letting us dig in. He's lucky he made it out with his hand. Know what I mean?? You know?? Nudge nudge, wink wink! 

Dipping options for dessert were bananas, strawberries, pound cake, brownie bites, etc. Obviously decadent. Obviously now sitting on my cheesy thighs. Ew. I know, right? Sorry for the visual. 

All in all, this was fun. For what you're really getting, I believe you could very easily replicate this at home for about 1/4 of the cost. I would go back as something new to share with people who've never gone before, definitely. Don't go if you're in a rush. The meal took over an hour."}
{"text":"I never liked fondue - that is until it was done correctly, The Melting Pot is definitely done correctly. This establishment is an eating experience. You do not get quality food, great service, and a unique fine dining experience without  spending a fair amount of cash. The Melting Pot is well worth the money spent."}
{"text":"Came to melting pot with the family and had a great time. The service was good and the food was just as good. Loved the idea of cooking our own, helps getting everyone involved and makes it more fun. My boyfriend and I will be going back for Valentine's Day and hope we have another great experience. 

Keep doing you melting pot!"}
{"text":"We ordered the \"Big Night Out,\" the Fondue Fusion option ($85 per couple) which gave a good sampling and variety. I highly recommend trying one of the variety packages on your first visit!! I initially wanted surf & turf but am really glad that my date wanted more variety because the lobster and filet mignon turned out to be my least favorite of the offerings. Our favorites were the Jerk-Seasoned Sirloin (the spices stay on even after 2 minutes of steeping!) and Marinated Pork Tenderloin (I couldn't get enough of this dipped in the indian curry sauce). 

The Wisconsin Trio Cheese Fondue was okay, it was surprisingly pungent from the bleu cheese.

The California Salad was drowned in dressing so I didn't finish it (was otherwise good), but the Spinach Mushroom salad was superb! 

The Cookies 'n Cream Marshmallow Dream dessert was delicious, our favorite dippers were the pound cake and rice crispy blocks!

My date doesn't understand why the meals are so expensive when the customer does most of the cooking.. teehee.

Overall it was a fun experience, but over-priced for the quality. I'd return often if it was cheaper or better quality."}
{"text":"Great food; great time!  Very pricey! Family of 6 almost $300.  May be a once a year meal!  Dad didn't like it...but the girls did!  May get less courses next time."}
{"text":"Actually a 3.5 (when yelp gonna let us give 1/2 star, coz I kinda have a lot in that range).

In general, very interesting experience but get prepared for a 5 hour dinner.

We ordered two \"The big night out\" dinners, (5 people), which comes with 4 course (Cheese Fondue, salad, entree and Chocolate Fondue) as well as the 5 hour dining experience as I mentioned.

For cheese Fondue, we ordered the \"Spinach Artichoke Cheese Fondue\" and \"Fiesta Cheese Fondue\", the later had a spicy flavor, very tasty, especially dipping chips in.

Salad served at the same time. Nice Salad.

After a LONG wait, too long that I even started to wonder the cheese fondue was everything we ordered, the entrees came.

I believe it had a couple pieces of each kind of meat. Chicken and beef were marinated with some kind of sauce (BBQ or teriyaki I think). The dipping sauces were amazing, display wise, not taste wise. 

I am not the best person to judge the entree since I am used to the hot pot style(Chinese Fondue I would say). All kinds of meat were sliced very thin and we never marinated anything with BBQ sauce.

We waited long again for dessert. It turns out to be worth waiting. The dessert is amazing. We had the milk chocolate and the s'mores.  I would definitely recommend the s'more to everyone. It was milk chocolate with marshmallows (as s'mores should be) adding a Little bit rum. The waiter lit it up just like the camp fire and the marshmallows started to melt right in front of you with all the sweet smell in the air!

There were fruit, cheese cake to dip in the chocolate fondue. Cheese cake is kinda too much. I wonder if I could ask for strawberry only next time.

The service was great. The waiter answered countless questions and make a lot of valuable suggestions such as the s'more.
Price wise. A bit to the pricy side. $40 ish each person for four courses.  To me it is better to skip the entree and just came for the dessert."}
{"text":"I go here every year for my birthday. It's amazing! I first tried fondue in Switzerland and this place is better! Bring your appetite and save room for the chocolate fondue portion. Pricey, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Sunday night, party of 5.   If you want the true experience of the Melting Pot you have to order the 4 course dinner which will cost you between $40 - $48 dollars per person (No drinks, not even Tea).  Dinner is brought in stages. (1)Fondue cheese dip with veggies. (2) Salads. (3)Main course (depends on what you order) fondue.  (4) Deserts Fondue Chocolate. If you order anything other that what normally comes with you dinner you PAY EXTRA. Believe me there are a lot of EXTRA's. Example: Lobster bites was $14.95 extra p/p with your dinner. Your paying for the experience and not the food.  Party of 5 with no drinks of any kind (but water) bill was over $200.00 + tip. Nothing special with any of the meats or shrimp. If I had to recommend one item it would be the ravioli in the fondue."}
{"text":"4 days ago 
They charge you to cook your own food and they charge you way to much at that. Tell you it takes approx. 2 minutes for med well in broth, after 4 minutes outside is cooked but raw in the middle, horrible experience. The service and dessert were great but overall I can only give it 1 star."}
{"text":"Chain or not, I love this place.  Absolutely adore it.  Can't get enough of it.  I'm actually sickened that I haven't been there in almost a year.  It troubles me.

I'd never done fondue before my first trip to The Melting Pot, having missed the 70s for a lack of, oh, you know, being alive or cognizant for most of the decade.  The cheese course is always astounding, and the server/preparer always tells me something new that I didn't know about either the preparation of the fondue or where they get the cheese or some other interesting tidbit.  (Didja know dusting the cheese in flour stops it from becoming too greasy as it melts and keeps the texture smooth?  Now ya do!)  The emmenthaler is my personal favourite.  The salad with candied walnuts, bleu cheese and raspberry viniagarette pretty much rules my life.

They have two cooking styles for the main course - Mojo and Coq au Vin.  I've tried and thoroughly enjoyed both.  The Coq au Vin is great with heavier meats like the teriyaki sirloin and the filet, and the Mojo works well with chicken and prawns.  I'm a nut for sauces and when everything is said and done, there are 7 on the table to compliment all your meats and veggies. 

Of course, the chocolate course is astounding.  I've had turtle, bananas foster, and plain old milk chocolate and all of them have been a delight.  A tray of: cheesecake, marshmallows, pound cake, pineapple, strawberries, and bananas accompanies the dessert.  Needless to say, I've waddled out of the restaurant many times.

The 4 course meal is called the Big Night Out and runs about $100 per couple with a drink.  It's worth it both for the food and the experience of doing the fondue thing.  

Crap.  Now I think I'm going to be dropping $100 on dinner sometime soon."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience at The Melting Pot from the moment we walked in the door! we were greeted by two friendly hosts and the female manager, as soon as we told them the name on our reservation they wished me a happy birthday! They were so sweet! We had arrived 30 minutes early and they were able to seat us prior to our reservation time. Our server was very friendly and he hung out and joked with us the whole night, he was so entertaining but not overbearing! He explained the deal chicken menu that we had purchased and even brought us a candle in the cheese cake for my birthday!  The ambiance of the restaurant was very inviting and elegant from the decor, the low lighting , and the high back booths which made us feel like we had privacy while enjoying our meal. We will definitely return in a few months to celebrate our anniversary and also come for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Great place for a family dinner with teenagers.  Nice, long meal allows for good discussion.  Kids love the fondue concept.  It's entertaining.  A bit pricey for what you get and I wish they had two burners at any table over a party of two.  The \"private\" two person tables seem a little out of the seventies, but all in all a fun place to dine."}
{"text":"me and my other 13 friends went this weekend, it is the worse restaurant we ever had!! none of us was happy with our food and service!!! 
I had to ask 3 times for my water. 
sits are pretty tide!! 
charge $2 for hot water with one slice of lemon!!! (for such a pricey restaurant...... is it an organic lemon??? or what!!)
$5 for hot tea.... 

anyone who says this restaurant is good must never tried the real food!!!! 
will never recommend this place! and will never be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Have been going here for celebrations for years and not sure why it took me so long to leave a review! Always great food, service and we always leave stuffed!"}
{"text":"Came in on spur of the moment. It has been an ok visit. It seems that are waitress is very sporadic in coming to our table. A bit messy when making the cheese. The main course arrived and it was not what we were used to. The filet minion had been changed, but no where did it say that in the menu or did the waitress tell us of the changes. It was still good but different. Also changed the vegetables that come with the main course. It came with squash and zucchini instead of mushrooms. Major disappointment there as they cook way too fast and get mushy. Missed the mushrooms with green goddess.  
I think we will wait a long while before coming back."}
{"text":"This place is a total Rip off !!!! 
When we arrived  nobody even noticed us for about 4 minutes.  It seemed nobody knew what to do ? It was weird.  Our waiter was nice but boring!!  I'm telling you it was a disappointing night. My birthday dinner was a bomb..such a rip  off for the amount of food we got .. my self my husband and our 2 girls. The bill came to $215.00 ......  such an expensive dinner plus they did nothing to celebrate my birthday .. just a bday wish ."}
{"text":"Great evening at the Melting Pot in Glendale AZ. 4 courses of great food. Andy waited on us and did a wonderful job!
Thanks to Yelp we received a complimentary box of chocolate covered strawberries."}
{"text":"A second great time at the Melting Pot! This time, I had a Living Social voucher and was nervous as I've seen some servers get rude with those. The hostess was a doll and just told us to give it to our server, said we had about fifteen minutes to go, and invited us to take a seat at the bar. The bartender was really pleasant, even as my husband and I just ordered sodas. What I really liked is that when the hostess came to the bar to get us, we didn't have to separately pay a bar tab, which can hold things up, you know? I'm assuming it's because we just had to sodas, but it was very convenient. 

When we were sat, our drinks were refilled even though they were half full and put into \"nicer\" soda glasses lol, but it was a nice touch. Again, this time the service was impeccable. Our waitress just mentioned we had a voucher up front, I handed it to her, and that was that. There was really no need to explain the entire process again, as we had been there, but throughout each course, she explained what she was preparing and it was really helpful. The food was great, service was great, and we look forward to returning of course!"}
{"text":"When we come here its mainly for a special occasion. More so cause this is an expensive place and I never get my money's worth. But family members seem to enjoy this place. My review is of their special 4 course meal. There are usually three main courses that you can eat all with some type of fondue plus a salad course. First course is the cheese fondue where you can dip bread, veggies, apples, and tortilla chips. Next is the salad. Third course is the meat fondue where you get a seasoned broth with an assortment of chicken, steak, and shrimp, this course used to limited but recently they changed it to unlimited amounts of food. And the last course, probably the best course. The chocolate course with an assortment of strawberries, pound cake, rice crispy treats, brownies, and cheese cake. This sounds like a lot of food but it really isn't. It's a good amount.  You'll run around 50 + tax per person. Like I said this is usually reserved for special occasions. Once a year it makes my family happy and that makes me happy."}
{"text":"Update! The Melting Pot now offers gluten free bread for those of us staying away from it = Hooray! They are also offering some premium dippers for the cheese which is a small plate of processed meats (meh). I suggested to the waiter that they just offer a side of crispy bacon for dipping... that would totally sell and I like bacon so just do it MP :) The Sip & Dip happy hour is nice and makes the night more affordable."}
{"text":"This is not an easy review to write because it has pretty much equal shares of good and bad. So, I don't normally make a pro / con list... but, here we go:

Pros:
· It's an experience, you don't just sit for a quick bite, you really can take your time and enjoy the dipping, eating and your company (just don't dip or eat your company, I hear that's frowned upon).
· The setup of the variety of meat, cooking styles and fondues makes you feel like you can be a little creative in your fondue concoctions. I'm tempted to bring my own food in just to see what kinda crazy crap I can come up with (chocolate covered sour patch kids, maybe?).
· Low-lit ambiance, perfect for sharing a meal with someone special.

Cons:
· Ridiculous pricey, I mean... you basically make the food yourself for crying out loud
· Food quality varies drastically. The bread gets stale before it hits the table. The cheese fondue I have found to be hit-or-miss.
· On an expensive set menu like on New Years, the dessert tray was sub-par. Marshmallows instead of the normal brownies and rice-krispie teats? For shame...

On a +/- note: parties or 4 have the advantage over parties of two. Why? There are two cookers on the bigger tables and they are convenient. When you have a party of two, the tables are awkward and you are almost forced to sit adjacent to each other. plus, the cooker is not easy to reach so you end up dripping chocolate and cheese all over the place  :/

Bottom line: Food / service / experience is VERY inconsistent. Not only over time but even during the course of one visit. Make sure you are in good company, because that's what will really tip the scale for you!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that i'm soooo happy Melting pot FINALLY opened in Canada! I had to go all the way to the states before for my \"western\" style hot pot! haha

There's many choices on the menu and they also have combos. cheese fondues, entrees (you choose the soup base, items) and for dessert? chocolate fondue! (even this, there is many chocolate combinations to choose from) 

we had a four course classic it was $86 per couple (fair price for all the things you get) and was very filling. got to customize and choose practically everything. My fav is definitely the cheese!

the service is amazing, the waiter really knows what he is doing, and comes around once in awhile. 

For the price, you can go to an Asian AYCE dinner for much less! but this is really different, you get to choose cheese fondues and chocolate fondues, however if your only here for the entree part and do not eat cheese or chocolate, then skip this :)

for the meat, please eat it quickly before it start going bad.

If your ready for the whole package, then it's a must try with some friends."}
{"text":"We went here with about 9 girls for my daughter's birthday. We started off with cheese fondue, and later on had chocolate fondue. None of the girls enjoyed the cheese fondue- and they were very cheap with the amount of bread and vegetables they gave with the cheese. We kept on having to ask the server for more and it took her at least 10 minutes to come back with another tiny bowl, for such a large amount of girls. As well, the service wasn't very good and the servers we had could barely speak English and didn't make this a fun experience. They charged us for extra cheese when we didn't order any extra, and we found that overall they were very cheap with the cheese fondue- and it wasn't even enjoyable. Then, we ordered the ying and yang chocolate fondue. While the presentation was very nice and the fondue was good this time, we still found it to be a bit overpriced for the amount of things they gave to dip. Then, they came and gave our daughter a TINY piece of cheesecake (and by tiny, we mean tiny) with a little candle in it, and they later charged 10$ for it! Overall, we felt that the service was bad, the food was mediocre, and they weren't very generous with the amounts they gave for the price they charged."}
{"text":"Well our dinner lasted two hrs, not because we were having a good time, but bc they took forever to bring our food out. Our server was very nice and knowledgeable.  I think its over priced for a cook it your self restaurant."}
{"text":"I went back to the Melting Pot after receiving a nice message from Erin. I had the Andouille Sausage and was very pleased with the meal. Everything was a little better than expected and more aligned with the price. The service was improved as well. Based on that, the space and decor I'm adding two stars (not that my opinion counts for a whole lot).

All in all they are doing a good job now and I hope they will stay on top of things because I plan to go back.

OMG this place is expensive and the cost is in no way reflected in the food or the service. Of you want to impress your friends with the size of your wallet and not your good taste, then by all means the Melting Pot is for you. If on the other hand you want good food and good service keep looking.

There is literally nothing to be said for the quality of my order or the service. I give 2 stars for the restaurant space and decor, which is great, no stars for the meal or the service. The owners and chef must be British. (Not that there's anything wrong with it)"}
{"text":"Overpriced for the tiny portions.  Food is overall good.  Atmosphere is dark, but fun to do the fondue dipping.  Not sure there are any fondue alternatives... if so they have to offer a better value."}
{"text":"A chain, yes. But par for the course, no. 

First of all, they have an extensive wine list, which includes a rare type of sparkling wine, called Brachetto. In this area, DUI's are more common than a cold, and it's a light and tasty wine, with a low alcohol content. So it's option is great for me. It also goes great with everything they serve, because of it's unique flavor profile.

Lizzie was our waitress, and offered options and suggestions, which actually saved us quite a bit of money on the whole. Not that, by any stretch of the imagination, is this a place to go when you are not intending a big splurge. This is a place to take it slow and spend slightly over a decent amount. 

The food, however, is absolutely worth it. We tried the Cheddar fondue, which could have used a bit more mustard powder and worstershire sauce, but on the whole was delicious. It was well prepped, and Lizzie explained what she was adding and why the whole time. The veggie selection is a bit mundane, and that's really my only complaint. We ate the \"big night out\" prix fix menu and chose the \"Fusion\" option which had lobster tail, shrimp, brats, ravioli, new york strip, sirloin steak, and a marinated chicken. We cooked it in the Boullion method which is just a flavored broth. Because it's not oil, you do need to add 30 sec to a min to the suggested cook times, but it was a lot lighter than using the oil and we didn't come home smelling like oil. The california salad was incredible. It had mixed greens, sliced roma tomatoes, chopped pecans, and blue cheese crumbles with a rasberry black walnut dressing. It's been a long time since I was able to truly enjoy a salad, and this was amazing. The chocolate we chose was the Smore. It was milk chocolate, marshmallow creme flambeed with grahm cracker bits added after the fire goes out. It's served with 2 types of coated marshmallows, pound cake, a slice of cheese cake, and a bowl of sliced strawberries and bananas. Just enough to fill us up, but we didn't overstuff ourselves. Our dinner was leisurely paced and took us about 2 to 2 1/2 hrs to get through. This is pretty normal for fondue. You do have the option of sitting at the bar and having just a cheese or chocolate, if you are on a time constraint though. 
It's located in a great little shopping and dining area that wasn't too crowed last night, but I think that was more due to the weather, than the actual popularity of the place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice!! So so so good. The first time I was a freshmen in high school and it was my best friends birthday. I didn't know the cost then but it was amazing. That time I had the appetizer, meal and dessert. The appetizer is a cheese fondue they make and you dip I think bread and chips and stuff in it. The second dish is different meats they bring you that you cook yourself in the sauce that they bring you. And lastly is the amazing dessert. The chocolate fondue with brownies, strawberries, bananas, cake, s'mores and maybe even more. The second time I did the same thing. It was back in 2014 for a anniversary. It was so good the first and the second time. The first time we sat in an open booth. Th second time I say in a two person booth and they close it with a curtain. So very private. Great service. Cute place. Yummy food. So very pleased and I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"As a self-proclaimed fondue fan, it was a no brainer to choose The Melting Pot for my hubby and I's Valentine's Day dinner. We've hosted fondue parties at home but with all the prep work that goes into it, we thought we'd let someone else handle that and just enjoy ourselves. 

We actually dined here on the Friday of Valentine's Day weekend as Saturday/Sunday dinner reservations were non existent by the time we phoned to make our reservations. Although I had been to The Melting Pot years ago (Scottsdale location) I had kind of forgotten the protocol, so was looking forward to experiencing the meal again. 

In all honesty, you are paying for the experience, not so much the food. It was a wonderful evening shared in our own private booth closed off by a curtain. Totally cozy and romantic....aside from all the interruptions but that is to be expected with a fondue meal. 

On Valentine's Day there was a predetermined meal; and it was delicious. I had a wonderful Pinot Grigio and the hubs had the \"Yin and Yang\" martini which he LOVED. The entire meal took about three and a half hours which was fine....we loved being able to just sit back and enjoy ourselves. 

We had a really nice server named Michael who was very knowledgeable and attentive. He helped us to understand how everything worked and his pleasant attitude really added to our enjoyment of the evening. 

The evening was lovely but quite honestly, we won't be going back anytime soon. To drop almost $300 on a dinner out, we want to walk out feeling like the meal we just enjoyed was the BEST one we'd ever had. And we left feeling as though our fondue is MUCH better than what we had here. 

If you haven' t been though try it--it is a fun time."}
{"text":"We really love coming here for special occasions! The staff is always pleasant,  helpful,  and friendly.  The food is amazing!  We always get the 4 course meal.  The new addition of the meats for the cheese chose is delicious.  We love the mushroom and spinach salad.  For the entrée course they're all good,  but we especially love puttingthe green goddess on the mushroom caps.  And dessert is always so decadent! !!!"}
{"text":"Our anniversary spot this last week, we had a great living social deal for all you can eat fondue so how could you not love that! We had a new server (to his admission) but it didn't show. They really train the new hires well our night was fantastic and we will be back for sure! 

Great place for the wife/GF if you haven't tried it yet you really should it's worth the price tag!"}
{"text":"You truly can't go wrong at this place. Food is phenomenal but what's better than that is the wait staff. For some reason every time I walk in this place I get the same waitress and she kills it every time. Jenny is the best. They took the fiesta cheese off the menu and Jenny took it upon herself to make the best cheese fondue ever. If you come to this place make sure you ask for her and give her the hugest tip."}
{"text":"The food was ok and so was the experience. We came here with my 9 year old and while she enjoyed it, it took entirely too long. I understand that is the 'experience' however when you notice a kid at the table, as a waiter you should speed it up a bit. We ended up sitting in a freezing cold room, shivering for 2.5 hours and eating dessert at 9:30 at night. It started off as a good time but after so long it stopped being enjoyable and started being annoying. It's pretty pricey for what you get. Overall I would go back maybe just for the cheese and chocolate but not an entire meal that wastes so much time."}
{"text":"This review is for dessert only. Came here the other night with a party of four. we just had dessert and it was amazing! We were kinda boring and just got the milk chocolate but it was perfect chocolate with all kinds of yummy treats for dipping, our favorites being the strawberries, cheesecake,  brownies and rice crispy treats, our least favorite was the marshmallows. our waiter was pretty full of his own self importance and a little annoying with his I'm so cool attitude, look at all my cool tattoos. Other than that it was great and we will be back for more of that yummy chocolate."}
{"text":"We ate here last week and had zero complaints!  Our servers were both very friendly and attentive.  We had a nice, quiet table in the back.  It felt like we were the only ones there!  The food was great as usual.  The land and sea is my go to entree here.  We also got the s'mores fondue.  It does take a while to eat all four courses so don't expect it to be a quick in and out meal.  I hope we can come back soon and take advantage of their great bar specials!"}
{"text":"Normally I give a 5 star report on this location. However this week while visiting for dinner with business friends, it seemed our service was just a step down from what we are accustomed to. For a moderately higher end dining experience, and generally spending close to $200(or more) on dinner and drinks with family or friends, we have come to hold a higher expectation. This past week our waitress, who perhaps was new(er), did a couple of things I hadn't expected or honestly, haven't experienced before. Starters, the gentlemen in our group ordered martinis, which took more than 15 minutes to reach our table. She said it was the bars fault as they were backed up but for being a rather quiet evening both in the restaurant and bar, we couldn't understand why that would be the problem. Then during our dinner, she struggled to get our cheese into the melting pot, and dropped several pieces, several times on the burner. The same thing happened with our cooking stock. First, while adding the garlic, stock was splashed and then burgundy was splashed on to the burner as well. There were two times that our waitress seemed to be missing for just a little longer than we would like to be checked on. Although she did come to our table and met our requests when she made her rounds. The main complaint the whole party had was that after the waitress had been gone and not been back to the table for a while, it seemed she went out and smoked a cigarette. As non-smokers, everyone at the table made complaint about the heavy cigarette smell when she came back to our table afterward. THERE IS AN UP SIDE. We had a delicious dinner! As usual the hostess was kind and chatty (which we all love), our waitress was very nice, although not very conversational with us. As usual... we will be back for our regular visit and dinner with the Melting Pot."}
{"text":"Not a fan, terrible service...spaced way too far apart. Options were never clear. Very cramped."}
{"text":"got spinach and cheese fondue and the chocolate smores fondue at  9 dollars each for the tuesday promo.  the cheese fondue was oober awesome and definitely would return. though sadly we ran out of cheese before the toppings which was surprising.                    chocolate fondue nth special for me, but a nice dessert.  would like to try their other stuff, but at their original prices, kinda hefty.  I'm glad to see a fondue shop in town though.

update: looks like the tuesday promo special no longer available. :("}
{"text":"The Melting Pot has been a staple \"celebration location\" in our family for a very long time. We celebrated our first anniversary there 17 years ago and continue the tradition each and every year. 

It's nostalgic to bring back fondue but it's truly an enjoyable eating style, especially when you aren't the one doing the dishes! Over the last few years The Melting Pot has offered an \"endless\" option of high quality meats (steaks, chicken, shrimp) too so you can be sure to get your money's worth. 

Our family likes the 4 course option starting things off right with cheese fondue, a choice of delish salads, the main entree (with zesty dipping sauces and veggies), and ending with chocolate fondue. Really, the food is delectable and don't forget to try the garlic and wine seasoning. This is an item you can purchase and I highly recommend you do! 

I could go on about the food, but let me tell you the service is amazing too! Everyone from the hostesses, to the bartender, to the servers, and the managers are great people looking to make the experience memorable and special. Your drinks will stay full, your table will remain clean, and everyone is available to answer questions all with smiles and positive attitudes. 

If you're looking for a unique dining experience look no further than The Melting Pot!"}
{"text":"This place has been around since around April and is located in that cluster of restaurants off of East Beaver Creek.

Highs - The chocolate fondue course was pretty good (we ordered the original peanut chocolate) and I'd return here for that.  Dipping sauces for the meat course were good, but don't overcook your meat because they're not thinly sliced.
Lows - My California salad was overdressed.. ask for your dressing on the side.  This place is also on the pricey side."}
{"text":"I have been to every Melting Pot in the valley.  I would go to one every day if I could.  Better yet, I would love to have one of those little stoves built right into the middle of my kitchen island, and somehow do this at home.  But ya know, it just would not be the same.  The service at Melting Pot is awesome and the ambiance is relaxing.  And I would need the funny and quirky bartender... things that would be missing if you opted to DIY.

I am very happy to see this franchise only a 5 - 10 minute drive away.  It is a great date night place for someone special (make sure they are real special because it is pricey).  There are booths for privacy if you request it.  The setting is romantic for couples, and if you are with friends it can be fun.

We usually go for The Big Night Out.  Its the four course dinner deal that includes the cheese fondue, salads, an entree, and the fondue chocolate dessert.  The price is steep but remember it is priced for 2, and varies depending if you order lobster.  I would also spend the extra $$ for either their Coq au Vin or Mojo cooking broths.  I have not had their standard cooking broths so cannot tell what the difference is but I can say I love the flavor put out by these two broths, especially the Mojo.  Expect to spend about 80-95 for two minimum, but you will most likely spend over $100 not including tip. 

If you are on a budget, then just come for cheese or dessert fondue.  Your experience will still be wonderful and your wallet will thank you.  I honestly would not come here just for the entree.  It will not be filling enough without adding the cheese fondue.  If you haven't been there in awhile then you should know, they updated their plateware from those sectioned TIN plates (makes you feel like you are eating out of a camping plate...or dog bowl).  They now have real plates, much more classy and suited to the dining experience."}
{"text":"My girl loves this place, and we go at least once a year. I'll warn you though, everything's expensive. I'm not saying it's not worth it, but to avoid sticker shock you should know.

The best way we've found to have a good time and have enough to eat at a reasonable price is to order a single 3 course flight and split it between the two of you. At a table for two, If you order more than one of any course you'll only get one pot at a time anyways so it's a bit of a pain.

You'll get a cheese fondue, a main, then a dessert. If you ask nicely they'll refill most anything you like to fondue. Honey catches more flies and all that.

I personally prefer someone else to do the cooking when I'm out to eat, but the wife adores it. To each their own.

P.S. I almost forgot! Throw all the potatoes in ASAP when you get your 2nd course! They take forever to cook."}
{"text":"What a great experience, amazing food, pricey for sure but very intimate and unique. Worth the price for a very special occasion. Plenty to choose from on the menu, we ordered an all meat entrée and it was filled with prime cuts and no marbling. Great experience, set aside at least 2.5 hours for dining but again worth it. Will return"}
{"text":"The Melting Pot is almost always a good stop. The happy hour is now all day, which makes it much easier to fit in than the previous one hour slot. They have started up-charging for cheesecake with the chocolate fondu, but the happy hour prices are still pretty decent. Space at the bar is pretty limited though and they do not like to honor happy hour pricing at the high tops."}
{"text":"Decadent meal with 5 star service.

Took the in-laws for a treat and this was quite possibly one of thee most enjoyable meals ever.   We enjoyed a wide array of delicious food and were pampered each and every step of the way.

Desert is killer and is very much a requirement to have before leaving.   Drinks were especially pricey as  the cheapest wine by the glass was north of $7."}
{"text":"I resisted going to this restaurant for the past two years because I don't enjoy sweet or cheesy meals.  I also thought the servings would be small and the prices high.  My wife finally convinced me and I am glad she did.  I had some of the best steak, lobster, chicken and other food as I have had anywhere else.  I was more than satisfied with the portions and actually was unable to eat everything that I was served. 

For a hundred bucks, we had great service, great atmosphere and great food.  This is a very unique dining experience.  I recommend it for either an intimate dinner for two, or a large group.  Although my experience was intimate, I can see how the process would lend itself to a great social dinner as well.

My rating is based on the combination of service, value and quality of food.  Oh, and the desert was better than I expected."}
{"text":"This place is the best restaurant in Arizona. They have the most friendly staff everyone from the hostess, bartender, waiters, cooks, you name it this place is ran like a business should be. Oh and did I mention the FONDUE!! WOW I took my wife here for our anniversary and it was awesome I would have spent 10x what I did to bottle that night and save it forever. Flowers table side, a photo with a frame to remember our night. It was the best. We will now be spending every anniversary from here on out with them. Thank you The Melting Pot, you made our night."}
{"text":"I recently visited The Melting Pot and I feel it was not worth the money I spent.

1.  The summertime sipper drink virtually had no flavor in it (I could not taste the alcohol or the fruit in it, the portion for the non-alcoholic version (it had flavor) was nearly 50% more than the alcoholic version.  Long story short, the alcohol killed the drink flavor wise and my evening as well in a way.

2.  The food portion for the main entree could have been more generous, food items were virtually bite size.

3.  While I appreciated the attentiveness of our waitress, the many times she visited us she always asked the same question \"anything else I can get you?\"  While I don't mind being asked for anything additional a time or 2, but 3, 4, 5+ times during course of the evening was beginning to get unbearable.  If I need anything additional you will be the first to know!

4.  In the men's room there was a non-functioning sink.. If I'm spending 3 figures at a restaurant myself and others should not have to wait to share one sink!"}
{"text":"This place is a ripoff.  I had been here 3x prior with a date but this recent time was an extreme disappointment.
I went with a group of 5 friends.  We ordered just cheese and chocolate.  1 of my friends arrived late and didn't eat anything just joined us for a couple cocktails.
When the bill came they had charged each of us 10$ per item, so 20$ for the cheese and chocolate.  The biggest disappointment here is that the same amount of food was disbursed as when I had gone there with just 1 other person.  Combined for the food our will was 100$ for the same amount of food that cost my date and I only 40$.
When my friend that came late and didn't eat mentioned that he didn't eat anything and came even after the cheese portion was gone the server said she would take care of it but when she came back with his receipt she had ran his card and charged him for food he didn't eat nor was even present for.
Extremely disappointed and will not be returned with friends nor a date.  This is not a respectable way to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent experience. Incredible service, they changed out two items on our 4 course meal since we didn't like certain items (although those also tasted amazing) with incredible service and friendliness. I will warn first timers that it's quite filling so make sure and prepare ample of space! Although I would suggest that if you do make reservations be sure and ask for a quiet spot far away from the restrooms since that always seems to be the issue with all restaurants."}
{"text":"All around amazing! Service was great, appetizer fondue melts with deliciousness, salads were good, salmon very fresh, ravioli tasty, and dessert like silk. I saw a review before going that stated the food was \"bland\". Personally bland was not at all the case! The fondue that I got was gorgonzola and bacon both are very rich in flavor. They seem to use a lot of garlic as well. With the dinner entrees we were given 5 boats of various sauces and a garlic/wine seasoning. If you use what is given the food was far from bland. The atmosphere is romantic and private. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had a 530 pm reservation. Seated right away. 555 pm still no service. Walked out without out a word from any staff. Guess business is good enough that it's not a big deal to watch more than $300 walk out with no attempt to even find out why."}
{"text":"place is nice inside food is premium. BUT over extremely over priced and insane. They make you cook you own food at the table in oil then dip it in sauce. The bill was almost a car payment."}
{"text":"This me start by saying I came to this restaurant on New Years Eve. My girlfriend and I came to Pheonix with another couple last minute and we wanted to get dinner together (just my girlfriend and I) and this was pretty much the only thing available at such last minute. 
They had a New Years Eve special going on which was $79 a person which included a New Years Eve champagne toast and a four course meal - a soup starter, an appetizer, the main meal, and then finally dessert. I'll just say this right away, the dessert here is phenomenal. We got the white chocolate creme brûlée and it was amazing. 
Now with that being said, everything else was just okay and for a $225 tab (we also had drinks) the service wasn't on par. It was almost as if it was our servers first time. She was super nice and attentive but her serving skills weren't the best. For example, we ordered a bottle of wine and she simply poured the taster in my girlfriends glass and then left! She didn't fill up her glass after she tasted it and then nothing in my glass. I'm no elitist, but I know what a good server is supposed to do and that's not it. 
The food itself was good but again, not great - not warranting the $225 tab. I walked out of the restaurant feeling a bit let down. But again, maybe I just came on the wrong night. The place has a four star review for a reason and I'm sure my experience was just abnormal. And like other Yelpers have said, it's a great place for a fun date night!"}
{"text":"This is my go to date night place. It's so much fun and the food is so good. I usually request one of their \"lover's lane\" tables when I make my reservations. They have a few tables that are cozy little booths that have a curtain that closes you in. It's really romantic. It is a little pricier than an average restaurant (like $90 for the 2 of us) but it's really a lot of food and it's a truly unique dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, but really could not believe how they try to up your bill, we used to come for dinner here but I didn't like the way the food tasted cooking it myself, so mostly come for desert, we had went somewhere else for dinner I decided to take my 12 year old and her friend for chocolate fondue and cheese, we got there after the dinner rush at 8:30 so it was fairly empty I ordered a cheese appetizer when they bought it out it was a huge pot of cheese,way too much for the three of us we couldn't finish it, come to find out he had taken the liberty of ordering us three orders of cheese at $8.95 a person usually when you go to a restaurant you get one appetizer and share especially when it's just two little girls, now he did inform us when we ordered desert that it was per person but it would have been nice to know that when I ordered the cheese! The other thing was they tell you on Yelp that they are offering free chocolate strawberries well when they get there they are conveniently out of them and choose to give you a voucher that you have to come back and order a meal to get your desserts I felt it was very misleading and I wonder how many times they do this??"}
{"text":"We had a great night here at The Melting Pot! We were able to get an early evening reservation on short notice. We had wonderful service - our server was very friendly, attentive, and thorough. And the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The Belle Amb pinot fit perfectly with the cheese and main course. Both were simply delicious and a wonderful experience. Ryan recommended the flaming turtle (chocolate, caramel and candied nuts) for the final course which was delightful! The whole experience made this birthday dinner date truly remarkable. Thank you to all the staff who made this possible!"}
{"text":"We recently ate out at the Glendale Melting Pot for a birthday dinner. This was our first Melting Pot experience. At first we had trouble finding the location because the front of the business cannot be seen from the street or even the parking lot. You have to walk into the center area of the little plaza where you will then see the Melting Pot sign. The service was great and our waitress was very helpful and friendly. We both enjoyed the spinach artichoke cheese fondue, and the cookies and cream chocolate fondue for dessert was divine. I would prefer if the dessert plate came with just bananas and strawberries for dipping in chocolate rather than that plate of rice krispie treats, pound cake and everything else that is too sugary and preserved for my liking. I don't know if that is an option, however. Also, I did not care for the food that was served. We got the the dish we you are able to select a broth to cook various meats, shrimp, veggies and pasta. Various dipping sauces are provided. The server took a lot of time and went into great detail about this platter and these sauces that frankly were not good quality or very inventive. I also do not like how beef teriyaki and red wine broth taste together....... but that's another issue. Anyway, this is a fondue place and what was supposed to be good was excellent. I would suggest ordering only cheese fondue and chocolate fondue for dessert. I would have given this place 4 stars if it was not for the price and quality of the entree we got. Good to try if you have never been here, but bring a fat wallet!"}
{"text":"We have gone here several times. We've always had a great experience whether it's for a four course meal or just dessert. Great food, great service. This time it was pretty terrible. We came in 40 minutes before they closed just for dessert(and we did mention we were just getting dessert) and treated us like we came in 5 minutes to close. The manager seemed irritated with us and it made the situation very uncomfortable. Then we get to the bar and everything seems fine but we get our dessert and we ask for extra of a couple of items to substitute for what we didn't want. The plate had way less than we've ever gotten in the previous times we've been there. Don't know if they gave us less to try and push us out or what the deal was. But we had no intention of staying after close and in fact we finished and got our check 15 minutes before they were closed and as other guests were starting their dessert course. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Awkward service, and weird restaurant layout.

The restaurant is like a maze. Not that it affected me, however I noticed a couple of customers get assisted back to their seats. The placing of the \"burner\" was a discomfort as well because you had to stand up to get to the last bit of the fondue. 

Service was just awkward. I was reminded three times about the more expensive menu (up-selling much?). And being visited every 2 minutes to be asked how we're doing is annoying as well, especially when your mouth is full of food.
Im not too surprised by the service as it is a chain restaurant, and not anywhere near to being a fine dining establishment. 

Food was alright, the fondue was quite bland. If their stock would be more seasoned, then it would have been quite good. Condiments were lacking in quality as well. 
The chocolate fondue was better and more enjoyable than the savoury version.
Then again, you cant really mess that one up.

I wouldn't recommend this place for any event. Quite pricy as well for what your getting. I found it amusing as well how they try to get you to tip 15% of the bill when paying with visa. Even you click \"Enter another %\", it still pops up as 15%.

The owners must be quite greedy with their customers. 

if you want fondue, spend the money and buy your own ingredients and have your own little fondue dinner. It will be much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Went to The Melting Pot with hubby last night. Our reservation was at 5 o'clock and we were seated promptly. The waiter asked if we had been there before and since we had there was no need for him to explain anything. We decided that one of us would do the four course meal and the other one would simply order the entrée so we wouldn't have so much cheese and dessert. For our cheese course we opted for the Wisconsin Trio.  It was so good and creamy and I loved the bits of shallots. They served it with pieces of bread, apples, and diced veggies. Even though it was only supposed to be for one of us it was plenty for us both to share. The next course was the salad course and hubby had ordered the Apple Bacon Spinach salad. We both loved it! The spicy pecans with the sweet apples went really well together especially when taken with a bite of the hard-boiled egg. It was then on to our main course. Hubby ordered the Fondue Delight which consisted of Premium filet mignon, Cold water lobster tail, All-natural chicken breast, Pacific white shrimp, and Wild Mushroom Sacchetti. I ordered the create your own entrée which consisted of Premium filet mignon, Sesame-crusted Ahi Tuna, and Honey Orange Duck breast. All of our proteins were very fresh and delicious. The various sauces they give you complement each one and I love how you can mix and match all of the sauces with all of the various proteins to get different tastes. By this point we were pretty full but we still had dessert to go! We opted for the Flaming Turtle chocolate fondue and it did not disappoint! Again there was plenty for both of us along with a platter of decadent desserts to dip into the chocolate. By this time we were both stuffed and couldn't eat a bite more. It was also after 8 o'clock so I was really glad that our reservation was so early. Our waiter was very nice and made sure to take care of us and ensure that the spacing between courses was perfectly timed. So all in all it was an excellent meal and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Decided to go during restaurant week. This is someplace to go for the experience and make sure you have at least a couple of hours to spend as it takes time to go through the the courses and cook your own food.  Glad I tried it but because of the price,  it's not something I would go back and do again. The waitress was great at explaining the menu and they have private booths with curtains to make it a more intimate experience if you prefer.  A good place to take a date."}
{"text":"Its a different experience of dining. Its very friendly and located in a good place. The server will guide you through the process of cooking. Great place to go for special occasions. Reservation is recommended"}
{"text":"The cheese course and dessert are on point.  I love coming here (both locations) and have been many times, having lived in the phx area all my life.  I do have to say that the entree has always been disappointing...the meat is mostly flavorless and the sauces aren't very good. The terriyaki marinated beef is really good tho...because it was marinated and actually has flavor.  You can do better melting pot!  Marinate your food...2 minutes in a flavorful broth isn't enough time to infuse flavor into meat."}
{"text":"Like the Melting Pot in Scottsdale, this location has a quiet, cozy feeling, but it doesn't take me an hour to get there :)  Big plus! 

A full meal here can be considered pricey, but you can always opt to just come in for desert, which in my opinion is the best part anyway, & then it is quite reasonable. A small will easily feed 2 & that will run you $16. 

The service is great. The chocolate fondue is fantastic. 
Our server recommended we try the Bananas Foster chocolate fondue. I'm not a big white chocolate fan, but he sold it well, so we went for it! It's described on the menu as 'silky white chocolate swirled with bananas and a dash of cinnamon and flambéed table-side.' 
I'm here to tell you that it is what they say & SO much more! I highly recommend it :D 

As far as attire, because everyone is tucked away into the little nook you can do what you want. Dress for the occasion you are personally there for & enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"First off I want to say that our service this evening was superb. Zach was top notch and definitely attentive to all of our needs. This would be a five star review except for some of the food was lacking. 
The cheese course had tomatoes served with it. While I like tomatoes the fondue just rolls off of it so it is a bit weird. The salads were super skimpy. We have been here several times before so this was a surprise. They have always been larger and more filling. Lastly which was our own choice, we got the Bourginonne  (sp?) Oil to cook our food in. We have always gone with the broths before and will stick to that moving forward. The oil itself is not so bad but the tempura and sesame batters that they gave to dip your meat in and then cook in the oil were awful. They did not stick to the meat at all and you have to hold your fondue skewer in the oil and not let it set in the pot. This is not easy to then eat and cook at the same time like you can normally do. Overall Zach is what turned this from being a 3 star review. So good job Zach!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time and really loved the preparation. The style was very unique and one of its kind. Food was awesome and specially the chocolate fondue it was yummy. A must try place.."}
{"text":"I took my family to the Melting Pot in Glendale after a busy week at work.  We had been there before so kind of knew what to expect. My daughter loves coming here because she wants to be a chef some day and thinks it is fun to cook her own food.  We had a reservation for 6:15 and upon arrival were taken straight to our booth.  Our waitress was very friendly and took the time to explain the menu and the appropriate cooking times for the different types of food.  The bus boy kept our drinks full and came by often to clear our plates.  The food was pretty good but the highlight was the dessert.  We had the chocolate fondue and my kids were in heaven.  While we were waiting for the dessert the manager came by and offered some comic relief...he brought a big bowl of broccoli and tried to convince my kids that it was what they were getting because they were out of chocolate.

I can't say that this is the best food I have ever had but the overall experience makes up for what is lacking in taste.  You can tell that the staff is well managed and that they want you to be happy.  They even took a picture which we were able to download for free from their website!"}
{"text":"Monday night my girlfriend and I tried The Melting Pot for the first time. Our server was Dustin and server assistant Mike. They were great at explaining the menu and provided excellent service. We started off with a bottle of Chardonnay I believe, which did not matter to me but my girlfriend found it excellent. When we first looked at the menu I was a little skeptical thinking about having dinner at a fondue place. When I think Melting Pot I instantly think Cheese Fondue or Chocolate Fondue. Not a four course meal. That is exactly what we ordered that night. 

We started off with The Traditional Swiss Cheese Fondue which included Gruyère and Emmenthaler Swiss cheeses together with white wine, garlic, nutmeg, lemon and Kirschwasser and some Brandy. There were sides of apple slices, nacho chips, bread, carrots and broccoli. We felt that the brandy made the taste of the cheese overwhelming. I pretty much ended up eating the whole pot of cheese to myself. Oh well, being the guy in the relationship, I expect it and am used to it. :P

Next up were our salads. I got the Spinach Mushroom Salad which contained Fresh spinach, baby Portobello mushrooms, red onion, chopped bacon and Roma tomatoes with a warm Burgundy Shallot Vinaigrette. She got the California Salad which included Mixed baby greens, Roma tomatoes, candied pecans and rich Gorgonzola cheese with Raspberry Black Walnut Vinaigrette. I found the salads pretty good but at this point I started to get full. Don't get me wrong, the salad was very light but I think the Cheese Fondue was hitting me.

Third course was the entree. It was a plate with Sesame-crusted sushi-grade ahi tuna, succulent white shrimp, seasoned choice angus sirloin, herb-crusted all-natural chicken breast and teriyaki-marinated sirloin. Our entree cooking style was the Coq au Vin which is Burgundy wine infused with fresh herbs, spices and mushrooms. I was full but once I saw the food I got a bit excited and began to cook again. My second wind came and I was eating again I tried out the meats with our sauces. There was Curry, Gorgonzola port, Green Goddess, Ginger Plum, and Teriyaki Glaze. Each meat went well with different sauces, its all a matter of trying them out, each person has their own taste buds. So many different mixtures.

Finally Fourth course was the Dessert. We got the Flaming Turtle which was We consider it Fondue Candy. It's an irresistible combination of milk chocolate, caramel and candied pecans flambéed tableside. There are no words to explain how delicious this dish was. This is what gave this review a rating of 5 stars.

It was a bit pricey but I would definitely wanna come back. I would go back to try the Fiesta Cheese Fondue, and maybe consider trying a new dessert but I doubt anything will beat the Flaming Turtle. This is a great place and I recommend it."}
{"text":"Took my wife out to dinner for her birthday and had heard that the melting pot was a fun place to go. I guess we should have gone to one of our usual places.

The atmosphere was very nice and the staff overall was great. The food though was not worth it. Over priced small portions. The fondue was something I could have easily made at home. I've been to other fondue restaurants in the past that far exceed the melting pot.

I would have at least expected a small desert for my wife's birthday but all they did was put a small candle on an already small piece of bad Angel food cake. Major disappointment for the cost.

I'm sorry to say that I won't be going back."}
{"text":"way too expensive for what it is. next time i will ONLY get the cheese and chocolate fondue and no nasty meals. the meat/seafood gets overcooked way too easily and tough. i didn't even finish eating mine it was gross and so was the weird sauces. the vegetables on the other hand take forever to cook and no matter what it is the food always gets lost in the bottom of pan and also the sticks always get all tangled. also why the hell would i want to cook my own meal if i go out to eat? no thanks i didnt realize this or i wouldn't have ordered the meal option at all. i don't recommend ordering the meal and i wouldn't have done this if I knew, but it seemed like the easiest and most versatile option. honestly i think its just the restaurant way of making more money, not about the quality at all. that being said the fondue idea is unique and when u order just that and no meals its actually really tasty. it looks great without u having to do any cooking or anything and the friendly server talks to u as they do everything for you and bring a pretty prepared plate of dippings. i really did enjoy the actual fondue part of the meal. i also liked the salad we got but its very small. the server lights some of the deserts on fire and looks really cool. if you're going here expect it to be expensive (I paid $120 for 2 ppl) and probably better if you don't go alone since its meant to be shared, also not the most kid friendly place fyi for people with kids."}
{"text":"Haha I know this is LATE, but THANK GOD this place finally closed down! I've had the worst experience in this restaurant.

Food was way overpriced, for their little pieces of bread, vegetables and fruits that everyone can make at home. 

There was absolutely no service from what I remember. We'd made an appointment for a party of 6, at 7pm and was never seated. By the time they called us at 9pm, we already went and were just seated at another restaurant. 
So the manager offered to pay for our drinks, gave us discounts and extra cheese, eventually my friends and I were lured back to the melting pot. HUGE MISTAKE! 

I'm really happy they closed. It was a waste of good space for such a poorly executed restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is awesome, the service is ok.  The seating is a bit awkward but that is mostly due to having a cook top in the center of your table, reducing the leg room.  

The food is VERY pricey for what you get, who knew some cheese and meat with some chocolate at the end would be $150?  I received a gift card for this place for $100 but found out when I got there it was NOT VALID on the good deals that they have, the all you can eat thing, it was only good on full priced items.  It is odd because a gift card is just a form of payment and should NOT be restricted, actually think there is a new law saying this.   

It was very confusing to order from this place, even the employees there were confused by some of the process.

The food came fairly quickly, and was AWESOME.  It took over 2.5 hours from start to finish, it was good that we had good company.  We went on a friday night and was shocked that the place was almost empty.  I think only one other table was occupied when we got there and only two other parties came in during the time we were there.  It was nice that we got our own room.  

Over all I think they have a great product, a nice venue, and nice staff, though more training would be nice.   The down side is the menu and prices are not right for West Phoenix....I would expect these prices in Manhattan or LA but they are too much for here."}
{"text":"For a mostly empty restaurant you would think they'd welcome customers. Nope, seating is by reservation only. I challenge corporate to review their sales numbers and questions why they're low."}
{"text":"The wife and I had a wonderful experience tonight. The food was delicious as usual, and the service was excellent. Joe was very personable and attentive. He was very knowledgeable. We will definitely repeat."}
{"text":"We went here for our Anniversary. Service was good food was just ok didn't meet my expectations for the price we paid. I don't think we will go back."}
{"text":"Always great food, very fun experience to enjoy a special occasion. Expect to be here for an hour and half to two hours, so make sure you enjoy that persons company. :) 

Staff is always super friendly and attentive. Clean environment, that is also very romantic and respectful of privacy. 

Love going here for our special occasion, just expect to pay a pretty penny for your meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in on a Sunday afternoon because we both heard so much about the Melting Pot. To be fair, going in we read how we would be boiling our food and we were skeptical right then but gave it a shot. We walked in and there was a blonde hostess that was incredibly rude. She looked at us when we came in and didn't say one word. I was standing literally right in front of her and she never had the decency to say, \"welcome to ...\" I've worked a long time in the restaurant field, I know what is required and this girl should not be working around people. She continued to ignore us and took some people to their table and another hostess came and we told her we have a reservation. She was sweet, just how a hostess should be. 
Our server was awesome that's why I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1, I can't remember her name but she was very friendly. 
We ordered cheddar fondue and when we tasted it, there was just something lacking to the taste, it was very bland. The salads came out tasty, but the entrees, my husband got the steak lovers, I got the shrimp, chicken, and steak. 
Our server told us to keep the food in the pot for 2 minutes and that's more than enough, shrimp 1 min 30 sec.. The chicken was not finished at 2 minutes it actually took 4 minutes, which I have no problem waiting longer but if that happened to someone who doesn't know, they could have gotten sick.. 
The shrimp looked and smelled awful.. My husband tried some and he has a high tolerance for food, and he could not eat the shrimp because of how bad the taste was. 
The only good thing we had was the s'mores chocolate. That was amazing if you like chocolate. So go for dessert, but eat dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Had a non-food issue & the Manager really stepped up to the plate. Nice environment & dining."}
{"text":"Arrived at the restaurant at 9PM and were seated by 903 (I know this because I had just called a friend to see if she had arrived, so I checked the call log). By 915, we had yet to see our server & had to flag down the bus boy to ask where our server might be. Our server finally arrived at 917, full of apologies as she had forgotten our table but promised she would make it up to us.
The \"making it up to us\" involved adding a little additional cheese in our fondue at no extra charge, but then continuing to make herself scarce throughout the rest of our meal! The food was good, but the service completely ruined the experience. Would like to return, but am hesitant to be ignored again."}
{"text":"We came for the chocolate fondue on a Saturday night around 7pm without any reservations. We were promptly seated at the bar.

The chocolate fondue here is the best I can find in vegas! The chocolate is very high quality.

The service was excellent.. The bartender was very friendly.. 

The chocolate fondue was cheaper than in CA.. $14 for the small and $24 for regular.  They also refilled our fruit when we finished them.  The chocolate fondue is a STEAL for these prices!!

I'm not a fan of cooking my own food so I only come here for the chocolate.  I came for dinner once and felt it was too expensive for doing it yourself. I don't know how to cook filet mignon properly.. I'd rather pay about the same and have a chef do it properly for and end up with a better tasting steak."}
{"text":"This place is truly a disappointment. I went for the first time in May and was pleasantly surprised by their amazing happy hour offerings and prices. I came back for a second time to introduce my boyfriend to the restaurant and was given an unexpected bill at the end, which double charged me for a fondue that we SHARED. When I asked why I was charged $20 for a fondue dish that I shared with my boyfriend, which on the menu stated $9.95, they told me I should have clarified that I was sharing. 1) I don't know why I have to specify that I'm sharing a dish with only ordered one of and 2) the fact that they charge each person that shares one order of fondue is ridiculous. Please don't bother going to this place unless you are willing to overpay for chocolate and a few pieces of berries/bread."}
{"text":"Great place with a very romantic atmosphere.  From the start of our dinner to the end our service was top notch.  The food is a little pricey but worth every penny.  Loved the chocolate dipping at the end."}
{"text":"2nd time going for happy hour and it was amazing again! I highly suggest getting the pomegrante cosmo, awesome!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended it to us after circling 4 times for a parking spot we finally found one. Luckily it was happy hour prices at bar only. We choose our cheese expecting to get lots to dip with and given small servings of apples and veggies. And very little bread. The salads were good but not worth the price. We were still hungry afterwards which if your going to charge 9 dollars for your fondue it better come with a lot more stuff to dip with. Getting meat was extra pricey. Will not be back cause parking sucks, portions for price small and drinks okay."}
{"text":"I really love this restaurant, especially just for a nice little romantic happy hour or even girls night out, but I just have to say that the last handful of times I've been in have been terrible service.. I work in food too and I try to have an open mind and realize when people are busy but there needs to be communication. The last two times I have sat at the bar and waited at least 15-20 minutes before I even had a water in hand.. I'm very patient and always make a point to say please and thank you and take your time, I tip well for karmas sake! This last time though the server didn't even give us eye contact for the first 45 minutes. A manager had taken our drink and cheese order which is totally fine because it happens, people get busy, but the recent lack of enthusiasm and general inhospitality leave a little to be desired.  I would have totally had two more of those pomegrante cosmos because they are awesome but the lack of observation or care in general kinda put an end to our night... the last time I came in my friend and I we were ignored most of the time even though we both as patient and understanding of the food service industry, but our bill after two hours was only $22 and the bartender was too busy tending to his friends that he ran our two cards for $60 each, paying for his friend's tab who had ran out quickly afterwards, like we wouldn't have realized that one round of drinks and some cheese split evenly was not even close to $60... the manager comped our bills which wasn't needed really, but our accounts were charged for over a week of the $60!! Can't say I'll be back again anytime soon, at least to this location."}
{"text":"Amazing food service ambiance and wine selection i will def. 100% come back !"}
{"text":"OK, so me and my lady went and checked this place out. The location of this particular spot is horrible. No way to see the place from the street so you aren't even sure you are in the correct complex where it is housed.  With that being said. We had a very enjoyable time here and the food was amazing. We opted for the all you could eat Surf n Turf each choosing a different option as to get the most out of the experience. We went with the Wisconsin Trio cheese pot. It was flavorful however I do feel that for the all you can eat option our cheese bowl should not have ran empty or should have had a bit more in it. Now onto the meal. We ordered the Mojo cooking style for our broth. It was extremely flavorful and a good upgrade from the traditional vegetable broth that the meal comes with. The meats, seafood as well as the raviolis and vegetables were all fresh and seasoned nicely. We spent a total of 3 hrs enjoying the flavors and each other's company. The restaurant however was very warm and an uncomfortable temperature. Even our waitress, who was good but talked so damn fast you couldn't understand what she was saying was even sweating bullets in the place. Other people across from us kept going outside to cool off as I did myself. The bar service was a bit slow averaging 15 mins to get another beer and cocktail per drink. Overall. We loved the place and will go back again. Even got my points from booking with Opentable"}
{"text":"Im not a big fan of the food, but the dessert is great!   You can't go wrong!  Melted chocolate with tons of stuff to dip it in, how could it get better?!  They have great dark chocolate fondue, with excellent dipper things (bananas, cheesecake, strawberries, brownie bits, marshmellows, etc.)  

This is a great drinks/dessert place that i would recommend! :]  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here with my girl friend and the experience was incredible. Not only was the food great but everyone treated us very well. This was our anniversary night and we treated in a very special way. Received a complimentary picture of my girlfriend and I along two glasses of champagne. I would definitely recommend the melting pot for anyone looking for something new or even any special occasion."}
{"text":"Love to fondue? You must come to the Melting Pot! Be warned, EVERYTHING is fondued (is that a verb?) ... well except the salads. The whole idea of fondue, other than melting things, is sharing, and this is a wonderful way to bring friends and families together. The first time I came here we were a group of 8 (including 2 young children) and we had to be seated in 2 adjacent booths. Because every table must have one burner it makes it a little difficult to accommodate large parties. Also, due to  people's preferences, or desire for variety, it is best to have 2 different burners.

The food then remains standard; it all depends on your choices of cheese, broth for the seafood and meat, and chocolate. You will be given MANY food options to dip and cook. Remember you cook everything! We all had a great time including the children.

Since then I have been back with others to enjoy just drinks and cheese fondue, or sometimes just for dessert, or again for a full meal. Either way I have been FUNdued every time!"}
{"text":"Came here a long time ago on a date and it was pretty terrible.
Pricey and you have to cook your own food for what felt like hours.
I wouldn't recommend coming here unless you like spending lots of money on mediocre food and like spending your entire day waiting for food to cook."}
{"text":"I sure do love the Melting Pot. And even love it more that it's finally on the northwest side of town!  We have been to dinner at this location at least 3 times in the past year and a half so I think I should be a good judge of this restaurant. 

First off the restaurant is set up very nice. If you have never been to a melting pot before there are booths with a burner in the middle for your fondue. Larger tables get two burners. The layout of this restaurant is similar to other Melting Pots I've been to. Nice, quite and romantic because it really gets you to have time to talk to your dinner date. 

We always seems to order the big night out which is endless. The key is endless! More on that later...first you get a cheese fondue to pick. Honestly I've had a few and all are good but what I can remember is the Wisconsin cheese. You get apples, and bread to dip in there after the server whipped it up for you. 

After you get a salad of your choice. I prefer the caesar. Add some of their special seasoning. 

Now onto the main entire. The last time we had the surf and turf  which includes steak and shrimp and chicken. You get a plate of meat to dip and cook into the fondue. As for the season of the actual fondue soup checkout the Mojo...it's worth the couple of dollars up-sell. 

The point of fondue is to cook your own food. Some people find his annoying, I find it fun and it gets me involved in the cooking. After it's done, pop some more In and enjoy with the awesome sauces they give you..best thing, it's endless. So if you want more meat, just ask and don't be shy. 

Lastly you get your choice if desserts. Can go wrong with any. Last time we had the banana fosters which was great. You dip cakes, and fruit into chocolate. 

Even though at first it appears that you are not getting much food for the price, but after the end of your meal I would be willing to bet that you actually are full! Not the cheapest place around...but it's worth it once in a while to celebrate something special. I can't wait till I can make my way back to here after writing about it.lol."}
{"text":"I love the melting pot! The  young man who served us this time was very nice but a little slow. Thet forgot to put our past on the plate and we were pretty much finshed with everything else by the time we received it. Perhaps staffing is short at this location??? We enjoyed our visit but I have to admit I liked the Scottsdale location better."}
{"text":"The romance package!! This place was so much fun and it was delicious!! My boyfriend took me here for our 6 months anniversary and it was absolutely fabulous! The Melting Pot is definitely the place to go for something special. I will never forget that experience!!"}
{"text":"I'm mixed on 3 to 4 stars for this place. Here is why:

The Great:
My server was fabulous. Complete sweet heart and was completely friendly. 
She kept a good pace of us never needing anything and being a part of the experience but never made it feel as if she was over doing it or intruding. 
Sarah was a great server that night and I am sure if I go back I will request her again.  She genuinely seemed to really want this night to go well and did her best to make sure it did.

The Good:
The food was good. Typical melting pot. I was disappointed that the big night out menu had no vegetarian option. That was really irritating but we moved past it and went with the Spinach Artichoke fondue, California salad (with sharp cheddar instead of the Gorgonzola) split of the vegetarian entree, and a custom mix of the dark & milk chocolate fondue with assorted flavors we chose. My mom was more impressed with the entree than the fondue which is sad for a fondue restaurant. 

The Not So Awesome:
Where we were sat we had people buzzing by us all the time, it was close to the kitchen. I remember comparing it to feeling as if we were seated in a hallway. Which, to be honest it seems like there is a lot seating that would feel that way. 
As I mentioned earlier the vegetarian option was rather limited and I was disappointed in their lack of foresight with the Big Night Out Menu not having any vegetarian option. From what I've seen before from this place this isn't a typical and they usually have an option to turn the big night vegetarian if you wish. I don't know what happened this time, but bummer for our entire table. 
Also, its not the easiest place to find. Go take a drive around the building after turning right in the first available turn in point and on the other it mentions the melting pot's entrance is around the corner.

To sum it up, honestly I believe I would have had a much less enjoyable time if it wasn't for the shining service of our server. If she had been someone else and not been so good at her job I probably would have been rating this place lower because the atmosphere was just ok with our seating, the food selection was much more limited that normal and what I had expected. I'm not saying I'll never go back, but if/when I do I'll be making sure to reserve a table in her section to ensure my dining experience goes well."}
{"text":"This is a fun restaurant. With that said it is expensive. But there are a couple of ways to eat there for a discount. One is happy hour. The fondue is five dollars a person. It is only available in the bar but children are allowed at the tables. It's the same fondue you get in the restaurant. Another way is to sign up for their emails every now and again they have promotions that they send out.
It is definitely a wonderful place for a date, after dinner you can stroll around the citadel. Their cheese and dessert fondue's are my favorite you can't go wrong with the chocolate turtle.
M-f happy hour:

4:00pm - 6:00pm: $4 salad $5 cheese and chocolate $6 cocktails, martinis"}
{"text":"Wonderful Experience!  

J and I had our first date night - post baby 2 weeks ago.  So we got dressed up, J in a suit and myself in a dress.  We were a little surprised that people were there dressed in jeans, shorts, flip flops, etc.  But whatever, we prefer to eat our $100 dinner dressed nicely.  LOL

We originally went got the AZ Restaurant Week offer.  $30 a person.  However, in looking at the menu. We decided that we wanted to do a dessert fondue, which didn't come with the AZ Rest. week menu.  So we opted for the traditional 4 course classic dinner - Cheese, Salad, Entree, and Chocolate.  

All of our courses were amazing.  The cheese fondue was great , with the pumpernickel bread (at least I think it was pumpernickel).  The salads were a little over-dressed.  But mine, the California (candied pecans, spring mix, gorgonzola) was tasty.  J still enjoyed his Caesar, with the encrusted pine nuts.  The entrees - shrimp, crusted sirloin,  chicken breast and teriyaki-marinated sirloin, and marinated pork.  J' favorite, the teri sirloin and the pork.  My favorite, the shrimp and crusted sirloin.  And the dessert fondue - The flaming turtle!!!!  Milk chocolate, caramel and candied pecans.  OMG so good I wanted to lick the fondue bowl.  I didn't lick the bowl, but I did run my finger along the inside.  Only did that once though cause it was hot!  lol

We'll definitely be back again for a special night out."}
{"text":"I experienced good service. I didn't understand what all the fuss was about the cheese fondue, wasn't impressed. Now the main course and desert, wow! Awesome. My overall experience was good."}
{"text":"Can be pricey if you go all out but I went for HH and paid $25 for a cheese pot, a salad, a glass of wine and dessert. Not too shabby. The bartender was very friendly and knew his stuff! Portions were large and I left very satisfied and will definitly be back."}
{"text":"There are a lot of things wrong with this restaurant and I primarily blame the people. I'm not sure why they have such attitudes. We had a reservation for 6 people for 5:45pm. My sister and her boyfriend arrived early and sat at the bar. We arrived at 5:45pm exactly and, even though the restaurant was completely empty, we were told \"Have a seat at the bar and we'll seat you when we can.\" There were *3* people just standing around the desk in the lobby-- doing WHAT, I ask?! Certainly not seating people-- no customers were within sight or earshot, except for a single gentleman sitting at the bar. Our waiter was... I don't know, exactly. Tart? Mostly okay, I guess, but kept disappearing and kind of sarcastic. The bartender wasn't the warmest, either, but was mostly okay as well. The wine he poured was clearly from a bottle that had been open too long. The taste of old too-cold (reds don't belong in the ice box!) is unmistakable and displeasing. 

We had the \"Fusion\" choice on the \"Night Out\" menu. Even though we had six of us, 3 couples, we were only able to choose 2 pots of anything which resulted in reduced quantity and choices. Their restaurant and seating options should reflect their menu. We should have been able to have more variety. We chose the traditional swiss and featured \"Mediterranean\" cheese. We had two pots of coq au vin to cook our food and that was perhaps a poor choice since it was flavorless and discolored the food making it look more or less done (depending if it was chicken or beef) than it actually was. Speaking of doneness, this restaurant needs some timers or a simple clock on the wall/table in view of every guest. Quite hungry, I kept taking my meats from the pot too early. We tried a variety of salads-- most were okay but the raspberry vinaigrette on the California salad was way too sweet. (Vinaigrettes are vinegar-based and are supposed to be tangy, not sweet and syrupy!!!) For the dessert fondues, we had raspberry chocolate and caramel turtle. The raspberry claimed to have hints of hazelnut but they were nowhere to be tasted. The caramel turtle was good but lacking enough pecans. And the dipping choices? Fucking atrocious. The platters needed more fruits and bland dippers (i.e. pound cake) because who the eff wants to dip oreo-coated marshmellows and brownies in a pot of chocolate? Well, okay, I do know some people but all the sugar is, quite literally, nauseating after all the rich food (cheeses, creamy sauces, heavily marinated meats). I had to ask for an extra bowl of apple pieces (from the cheese course) and additional strawberries . Dipping sugar in sugar is just..... ugh. 

I think the food is very overpriced for what it is. None of the meats wowed me. The shrimp weren't even deveined and the lobster was tough and not properly cut for cooking. The sauces were bland at best, with the exception of the pleasantly spicy cocktail sauce for the shrimp. The \"curry\" insults curries everywhere, to be certain. The coq au vin was flavorless. 

The negatives are endless. Reservations are pointless, the staff needs a major attitude adjustment in addition to a lesson in customer service. I will not ever patronize this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This was by far the saddest experience we've ever had at a restaurant. The server spoke so fast and garbled that we had asked her several times to repeat herself and we still couldn't understand her.  So funny because after getting ready to write this review on open table I saw that somebody else complained about the same thing. The light above our fondue had so much dust in it that I thought a dust bunny was going to fall on our food so we actually had to clean the light. We ordered off of the special menu and none of the food seem to be deserving of the $150 price tag that we had for the two of us. They are bound to go out of business here because they are located in such a poorly found place and the food and the service is horrible. Mark my words this place will not be in business in 2019."}
{"text":"It was only ok.  There were 4 of us, we ordered an appetizer and a dessert and the bill was $104 w/out the tip.  Service was so so; seems no one remembered to bring the drinks we requested.  The dessert tray we ordered came with different items on it as they were out of the items that were listed on the menu.  Which is ok, but if I had know that ahead of time I wouldn't have ordered the dessert. 
While the food we did order was good I won't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like cheese and chocolate! My husband and I went here for a date night. When we got there the lady asked how can I help you? I told her we had reservation and she got us quickly to our table. Our waiter came quickly and asked us have you been there before?..I have but that was my husband's first time there the waiter was very nice a explained how things are done there which was nice. We ordered our drinks which came out quick. We decided what we wanted to order and the waiter was very nice and said that will be right out. My husband really liked how they made it in front of you and all the veggies, fruit, and bread that came with the cheese. It was absolutely delicious!  We had the chicken with the broth which came with veggie as well. The broth was amazing I wish I knew the recipe...it would make a very good soup. We finally got a milk chocolate fondue which came with fruit, marshmallows, and more. It was so good and creamy. We had so much fun and it was very entertaining. It is alil spendy but well worth it! Definitely come for a birthday, special occasions,and a date night."}
{"text":"Okay, this is an awesome place.  I recommend getting the \"All You Can Eat\" fondue special. 
You get one appetizer (a cheese fondue), a salad (either house or caesar), main course with vegatables (put those in the pot right away), multiple meats that you can refill until you had your fill, and then a dessert fondue.

Because fondue is more methodical than just stuffing your face at a buffet, you will eat a lot less.  But, the food is soooooooooo good.  The quality of the meats are excellent, and I do not feel like I am overcharged at all.  

Quality costs money!"}
{"text":"Dine with a decisive crew because you'll need to decide on one cheese pot and one chocolate pot for the table.  Also the \"ambient\" lighting means that it's dark inside so be prepared for that.  Not candlelight dark, but dim lighting.  

Haven't fondued in years and this was the first visit to Melting Pot.  After enjoying a 4-course dinner I wouldn't recommend this place for a meal.  Go only if you want appetizers.  

The 4-course averaged out to $40 pp but I think it would be better to skip the salad and entree, just order the cheese fondue to start and a chocolate fondue to finish.  Still decadent, yes, and truthfully these are the main attractions.  

First:  Brie and Pear cheese appetizer came with chunks of brown and white breads, small bowls of veggies, and small bowl of granny smith apples.  Had to ask for refills.  The wine and honey flavors were heavy in the cheese.  I'm not a lover of cheese, but surprisingly l kept eating.

Second:  Salad was petite.  I was not impressed.  I've eaten side salads bigger than that.  Raspberry walnut dressing was quite good, though.

Third:  Entrees looked bigger than they actually were because of the way the food was plated.  A bowl of more veggies and potatoes accompanied.  Needed a spoon in order to dip some broth out of the pot with the warm food.

Alongside, there were five condiments, garlic butter, and a lemon wedge for the lobster.  Garlic butter was tasty, but I didn't like the other condiments too much.  I can't even remember the exact flavors but I think there were plum sauce, spinach in white sauce, teriyaki sauce, aioli, and a curry cream.  If not those exact flavors, then something very close.

Forth: Chocolate dessert - the best course.  Flaming turtle fondue.  (Our server really wanted to set something ablaze.  Fiiiire!)  Chocolate was so good, I wanted to drink it.  But everything was overly sweet so had to go easy.  

Exactly like the menu says, dippers included bananas, pineapple, strawberries, pound cake, chocolate brownies with chocolate chips, marshmallows, and krispy treats.  Our greedy eyes made us order the add on plate of cheesecake (very small slice), cream puffs, rolled gaufrettes, and berries.  

Server gave us one refill of our choice.  Of course it was cake.

The Melting Pot would be a fantastic night out for lovers to sit at a private table and get jiggy wit each other over some chocolate strawberries, but if you're really into this and want to impress a group of friends, I suggest buying your own fondue set and serving @ home."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner. We'd never been, and other than the fondue, we didn't know what to expect. I was surprised to learn the entree was a cook your own (Korean bbq-ish) type of meal. But we were pleasantly surprised. For the price, my husband and I both felt like we got to eat a significant amount & walked out completely stuffed. The service was friendly, the restaurant was clean. We will absolutely be returning. 
(PS. Don't know if it's a thing or if the server just chose not to, but the restaurant doesn't do anything for birthdays! That's a huge selling point for me as there was no crazy singing to embarrass me)"}
{"text":"Unique place with a staff who are under schooled in their products. While I enjoyed the cheese fondue the bread and dippers were lacking ingenuity or freshness. Way over priced for what they give. Stay home and bring back the 80's fondue at home is more enjoyable. Wish I had better things to say."}
{"text":"TL;DR version: The food is fun, if a bit gimmicky (only the first course is \"real\" fondue, c'mon), but the service is wonderful and the ambiance is great. Overpriced as others have noted, considering you cook your own food and the food cost can't possibly be that high, but we'd still go back.

----

The place was almost impossible to find in the dark because the entire complex IS dark. Seriously, the windows were completely black and the sign was almost impossible to make out. After circling the parking lot a few times I actually had already punched in another location on the GPS when my husband spotted a directory and jumped out to look. It was a little Haunted Mansion \"no windows and no doors\" esque.

Wine: So good. The end.

First course: Why are there green apples served with spinach and artichoke dip? Who thought that was a thing? My husband just ate them separately while I judged them too harshly as I am wont to do. The veggies were also really hard to spear. The bread was a little dry, but the only logical option and really good once we got dipping.

Second course: Salad was really good, and there was a non-iceburg option. Always a win for those of us who prefer digestible foods.

Main course: Good, but again, a little random. I wasn't a fan of any of the sauces for dipping the actual food in, but a few were pretty good on their own. My shrimp-hating husband thought the shrimp was the best option and ordered more, so that's pretty impressive.

Biggest fail of the evening: We were seated next to a crazy drunk couple who we kept thinking would leave but they kept ordering more wine and dessert. Considered asking to move, but... awkward... and didn't want to get in a parking lot fight. It's Arizona, after all. The restaurant was practically empty, and the couple said they had been there for like 5 hours. Why did they seat us there in the first place? The woman kept calling out to us asking how our food was and telling us what to order and then smoking a hookah vaporizer pen talking about how high it made her feel when no servers were in sight.


It made for a funny story to tell our friends, but an entirely unromantic evening. Thankfully we weren't celebrating anything."}
{"text":"Great experience! The portions are a little small for the cost, but you cook the food yourself with guidance and that was fun. Nice staff."}
{"text":"Cheddar cheese fondue was the best of the three that we tried. The milk chocolate was perfect for kids."}
{"text":"2 people $120 for melted cheese and melted chocolate in a pot with rude stuck up service... you wont find me alive or dead in this over rated and over priced rip off.  For the money you can go to the finest restaurants with the finest service for less or around the same price!"}
{"text":"This is a newer location in the Valley and it is fantastic. My husband and I came here with the living social deal. We have been to Melting Pot before so we knew what to expect.

I booked my reservation, put my living social number in and asked for a private room. We went on a Wednesday, the place was very quiet. (It was the only day we could get a baby sitter so sue me)

The private booths are an L shaped booths and you will be cuddling but you can stretch out in order to eat. 

The staff was very friendly and it was endless entree, we had absolutely too much of everything including:

Cheddar Cheese Fondue (This was amazing, with a beer base...cheese and beer...come on HEAVEN)

House and Caesar Salads

Cog Au Vin Entree Broth (utterly amazing)

Then we got to dessert. We asked for them to add Creme De Menth for a mint chocolate fondue. Let me tell you...this...was...AMAZING. Best fondue I have ever had hands down.

The Moscato wine is also worth noting, we purchased a bottle and it was one of the best Moscatos I have ever had.

We love Melting Pot and they delivered last night. We would love to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"Fondue heaven.  A leisurely dinner that lasted four hours that encompassed the \"Big Night\" menu option.  This included a cheese fondue, a salad choice, the Lobster Indulgence in a cooking style (our choice - Mojo Cooking Style), and a dessert fondue.  We added a bottle of Asti Spumante, Martini & Rossi champagne to complement our meal.

To start, our waiter melted the cheese fondue (our choice - Traditional Swiss Cheese Fondue) right in front of us.  He presented us with cubes of bread, veggies, and apple slices for dipping.  Next time I would try a different flavored cheese mix, something a bit bolder perhaps.

Next was our salad (our choice - Strawberry Almond Salad), which was a nice mix of sweet with the strawberries and tartness from the balsamic vinaigrette.

The waiter arrived with our entrees next (Lobster Indulgence - twin lobster tails, teriyaki sirloin, black tiger shrimp, citrus-marinated pork tenderloin, breast of chicken, and roasted vegetable ravioli), a beautiful display with the lobster tails cut perfectly.  After adding different spices to our broth, he went over the finer details of how long we should cook our various foods, from the veggies to the seafood to the meats.  Tons of dipping sauces accompanied the entrees.

To conclude our meal, the favorite of everyone's...dessert (our choice - Tropical Coconut Rum Chocolate Fondue).  The waiter arrived with our melted chocolate and added the rum and spices.  A plate of bananas, marshmallows, pound cake, strawberries, pineapple and brownies were presented for dipping.  Yummy.

This was a hearty meal for two, but thoroughly enjoyed.  If you can't do it all, come by for dessert at least.  That will bring a smile to anyone's face I'm sure.

This restaurant works great for couples or large groups.  Great for parties and social gatherings because of the interactiveness of fondue!  If going as a couple, ask for one of the private booths away from customer traffic.  You'll be left alone plenty to indulge in the decadence of your meal.

This is the type of restaurant where you can have fun eating and dipping.  Bring someone with you that you know you can have fun with.  It just makes the experience that much better.

(Check out the photos from our fabulous meal above!)"}
{"text":"I love the Melting Pot. It is my most favorite place to eat. It's a bit pricey but worth every penny. At my house we have to refer to it as \"MP\" because if you say Melting Pot we all practically jump in the car to go and our mouths start watering. The service is great and the atmosphere is very romantic for dates."}
{"text":"Cheese was good, chocolate was good, wine was good. Main course was terrible this visit. The meat was tough and unappetizing. Came for our anniversary and it wasn't made into a special occasion like some reviews and pictures show it was for them. The hostess was rude at the start, which always leads to the server to fix, which he was great. But no special touch to the occasion and a terrible dinner will lead us to not be back."}
{"text":"The ambience was nice. We got a nice little private space in the very back. The hostess and waiter were very kind and professional, as well. 

I got the sunshine sangria, which was pretty delicious. The asparagus and prosciutto fondue was okay... I probably should have gone with a cheese less bitter for my tastes. I was also not very impressed with the breads and veggies we were given to dip with... The bread was dry... And the veggies were, I'm assuming, purposely uncooked so it was hard to even stab the veggie.. I think it would have been yummier to dip cooked veggies in a hot cheese fondue.

The salads were okay. Not large portion, which is okay since we had a lot of food, but it was overly drenched in the dressing... But I did like the dressing flavor...

We also got the teriyaki sirloin and ahi tuna. All the sauces and everything tasted good. But not so astounding that it was worth the cost of the whole meal... Even with the living social coupon, total of everything with the options we got was $70 with tax and tip. If living social was not used, it would be I'd assume closer to $110 for two people.  For a meal for two to be in the triple digits, the food should be more delectable... Reminded me of just an americanized shabu shabu or hot pot... And not as tasty as hot pot, which is much cheaper. The extra cost is for the experience, I suppose.

Tip: If you check in, they offer three chocolate covered strawberries. But they won't give it to you unless you tell them about it when you make reservations since they wont have enough premade batch for you."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places ever. I heard they just closed both locations here in las Vegas. Cross your fingers they re-open."}
{"text":"Great food, as always!
The hostess was pretty rude. We arrived a little before 9 and she said \"do you want just chocolate because we close at 10 and it usually takes about 2-2 and a half hours to eat the full course meal.\" I understand that maybe people new to the restaurant or big groups might take that long, but my boyfriend and I have gone to multiple Melting Pot locations many times and have never taken anywhere close to that long to eat. Needless to say, we were out before 10:15.
But our waiter's great service made up for it! So did the excellent dinner and dessert! Another great Melting Pot location :)"}
{"text":"The food was as amazing as always.  This is my first time at the arrowhead location.  Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable. The only thing I did not like about this location is their hostesses. They was wearing extremely tiny black strappy dresses. Very inappropriate for a place that many folks bring dates.  It is possible to wear appropriately themed clothing and show class.  The Scotsdale location is better in that department. I will be going to the Scotsdale  location from now on."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a melting pot.  I was impressed with how quickly we were seated.  The waitress was lovely and explained everything to us.  The food was fresh and arrived with perfect timing between courses.  They seem to have mastered their process.  

However,  we were totally ripped off. 

We shared a bill with another couple we invited and split the bill accordingly.  After further review they did not honor a promotional item which was the only reason we elected to try this place.  Instead of the promotional value being $70 it became $10. The explanation they gave was that it was for 2 people and our table was four.   It made no sense that we were penalized for bringing more customers.  Never going back."}
{"text":"We celebrated a birthday at The Melting Pot this weekend and everyone got the 4-course meal. We enjoyed the food and the high price didn't bother me (as I noticed it was a comment on many yelp reviews) because it was an experience and you spend around 2 hours at the restaurant. We had the prosciutto & asparagus cheese fondue, everyone got different salads and entrees and then flaming turtle chocolate fondue. Highly recommend the cheese and chocolate fondue - it was the highlight of our meal.

Con - 
We had one person out of the 4 of us that has a shellfish allergy which we didn't think would be an issue but we had to make adjustments when cooking our dinner. Since we only had one cooktop at our table, we had to cook all of our non-shellfish food first and then cook the shellfish. The 3 of us had at least one or two items that were a shellfish so we had to wait to eat those last. Additionally, I wanted to get the seasonal seafood entree (lobster, shrimp, crab, and scallops) but had to change my entree since it would mean one person would cook and eat their entire meal before I could start cooking my meal. It takes 1.5-2 minutes to cook each bite so it was not going to work out for our table. Since we made a reservation, I wish they would have asked about an allergy or something so we could have gotten a table with two cooktops because we saw other 4-person groups at a two cooktop table and saw an empty two cooktop table. It is just something I know to ask about next time but in case it is your first time all meat cooks in the same pot so be cognizant of allergies. 
So I gave the experience 4-stars due to not having a solution for allergies except that one person has to pick a new entree so we can all eat at the same time."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for a long time and finally went tonight with a couple friends for the Ladies Night Out event. We all had a great time. The food was good and the portions were generous. Our server did a great job taking care of us. This is someplace I would come back to for a special occasion."}
{"text":"The \"sip and dip\" in the bar is one of  my favorite things at Melting Pot, to be able to go in and grab a glass of wine and an individual cheese dip with all the fixings is PERFECT."}
{"text":"We had a Business Mixer at this location and was dissappointed.  IT was prearranged that we were coming as a group and to stay on a certain type of menu as everyone buys their own food and drinks and it's happy hour at this time.     The happy hour menu wasn't presented to everyone and they were shocked at the drink prices.   The prices of EACH person who \"ate\" was charged separate prices!  But there was ONE POT of the melted cheese shared with 5 people????  Each salad was $4, was very tasty BUT small.  The dessert (One Pot of melted chocolate) was awesome BUT each person who ate it was charged $5 a piece.
Guess what the bill was for two kids and two adults??  
$88, and they charged over a $10 TIP for two kids.
Gratuity was NOT discussed prior to this meeting.
IF you are going for a \"Special\" occasion for two adults, I can see spending this kind of $$$ maybe?  Other then this, we weren't FULL but the restaurant sure was full with our $$$."}
{"text":"This was the first fondue restaurant I've visited, and I really enjoyed it. The most expensive meal is about $100/couple. My bro, sis-in-law, boyfriend, and myself chose this. It was pure heaven! The meats were delicious and it's very surprising how certain items go well with cheese. The dinner will last quite sometime (about 4) hours, but it's well worth it. After downing a couple bottles of wine and a few more cocktails, our bill came up to almost $350 including tip. Yea, pretty expensive...but a fun place to have dinner ONCE IN AWHILE."}
{"text":"Chocolate Fondue.... Skip everything... go straight to the Chocolate Fondue with a shot of liquor ($6) at The Melting Pot!

For $18/2 and additional $9 per person...You can share a \"To Die For\" Dark Chocolate fantasy with your friends and love ones! Strawberries, Pineapples, Marsh mellows, Cheese Cake, Crackers... 

I did try out other things at The Melting Port... but I found especially for the Main course entrees we had, they were kind of disappointing.

The Shrimp & Sirloin ($26)
The French Quarter ($29) - best of the ones we ordered as the spices gave them a good kick
The Seafood Trio ($28) - Small pieces of Ahi Tuna, Salmon and Shrimps..really small portion
The Land & Sea ($28)

The above all came with a Side Salad... The salad are just Meh.... 

The sauces came with as dipping, not really helping in enchancing the taste or experience.... 

I do love the set up of the restaurant. The booths have a lot of privacy...and they also have private rooms if you want to have a little party?

The staffs are friendly and wonderful.

I probably come back just to have Fondues... and more Fondues... And be in a Cheese and Chocolate Coma...and fight with my friends with my little fondue fork... over a bottle of wine!!"}
{"text":"Went with friends about a month ago. Ask for the sip and dip menu if you're there early enough. It is a good deal.  Nothing was mentioned about the sip and dip until we asked, but brought happily when we did. We ordered the fondue, individual salads. I had a froufrou drink.  Total was $15.05 with tax and another $3 or so for tip. 

The fondue was quite good.  The fruit and veggies were okay. Carrots? Okay.  Apples? Okay etc. Strawberries were great. One friend did order meat for the fondue, I tried a bit. Eh, not my taste. 

Salad was GREAT. Really. Small, but very tasty. 

Froufrou drink - cranberry cosmopolitan - was okay. I wouldn't order again, but once in a blue moon, froufrou is good. 

Server Ivan did great job.   Friendly, efficient, helpful. Excellent service. 

I woulda ordered dessert, if anybody else would have shared.  Selfish women said they were too full."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTLEY THE BEST TIME I'VE HAD AT A RESTAURANT IN A LONG LONG TIME... With that out of the way, my future wife and I couldn't have enjoyed the food any more. Our server Brandon was very informative and patient, as we had never done fondue before. Make sure to try a dessert one too! Ours was phenomenal!!! 

Food: so delicious you melt into your booth... Service: outstanding and fun... Atmosphere: Romantic and luxurious... Overall experience: Wow, we have to digest this so we can come right back..."}
{"text":"Yep it's worth the splurge.  Got the never ending fondue,  we started with the trio cheese and the spin artichoke fondues nice way to start. On to the main which was the classic, we tried the bourguignonne, and mojo both were flavorful and never ending wow, then to the dessert we had a peanut s'more and pecan caramel ouch, they rolled us out of there."}
{"text":"For six years I lived literally across the street from a Melting Pot in California...and I probably went 3 times total in those years. 

We went to this MP for happy hour since its right across from my school and trust me, I'll be going again! The service is excellent and the food is good as always! They have an awesome happy hour, 5 bucks for their cheese fondue that comes with 3 types of bread, fruits and veggies. The dessert plates are 10 bucks and comes with a plate of treats to dip into one of their signature chocolate fondues. Everyone wanted to try a different fondue so our awesome waiter/bartender gave us dessert for one and split the price. 

I'll have to come back for dinner to have their entrees again, its been a while. This place is definitely worth a try, great ambiance for dates, and good food. Its a bit pricey but I think the food and experience make up for it."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience,  we chose this place for our anniversary,  I got the romance package and my wife loved it,  food was great and the service was fantastic.  Our waitress Heather explained everything and was kind and professional."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here on Friday night and we had a fantastic experience! We were greeted by friendly people at the front and then guided to our booth which was tiny but intimate. Our server was there right away to greet us and I have to say - it was the best service I have had .. Maybe ever. She was attentive but respectful that we were on a date so she wasn't by every few minutes .. She joked around with us and was knowledgable about the menu selections. I can't remember her name but I know she has a five month old son and her fiancé works at bww - for any management reading this - she rocks! Our dinner was ok, we weren't thrilled with the duck but the ahi tuna was out of this world! By the time dessert rolled around we could not have had another bite we had had so much food. All in all we had a great night, great service, and the ambiance was perfect for Friday night date night. Oh and we had a groupon , but without it would have been $120 for two of us after tax and tip , not bad for what you get!"}
{"text":"My daughter sent me a gift card for Mothers Day.  We arrived at 11 a.m. and were given a warm welcome.  After were seated and the meal was explained to us, we sat back and relaxed with a Mimosa.  My husband and I had the best time.  It has been 40 years since I last used a fondue pot.  The food was fabulous!  The service was extraordinary, and the experience is worth doing again.   You will find there are so many choices, from the seasonings to the oils.  All I can say is YUMMO!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, it's been 10 years since I had been to a melting pot and now I know why! Horrible food, terrible service, prices are ridiculous. Pick from the list on a special they give you then they charge extra from a sauce given on that list? Meats, veggies and cheese/sauces no flavor what does the chef have to do when you have to cook your own food I know learn how to season food! My bill was 112 for crappy food I could have gone to a hole in the wall bar and received better food and service! Don't waste your time or money!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting at the Melting pot. I had the most best ever waiter and who explained the entire menue and had patients. We ended up spending $140. That is well worth it. The fondue with artichokes wss excellent but not enough. The summer saushage i could not get enougj of."}
{"text":"A lovely treat and a wonderful dining experience. The dark chocolate and chambord dessert is was incredible. Highly recommend this for a special celebration or just for a fun dessert out."}
{"text":"Great service! Good food & fun experience! The four course meal experience took 2.5 hours to complete. Our family made up of the hubby, son 14, daughter 23 & myself kept wishing that this restaurant was a NO CHILDREN ALLOWED establishment. Omg too many little ones everywhere and some were running around and some were crying UGH!!!!! We dropped a ton of money at this place for the one meal and just felt like the bratty kids killed it for us. This would've been a five star had it been a more peaceful and just over all better ambiance setting. We will go back if and when they stop allowing kids 10yrs of age and younger. Lol. No BS"}
{"text":"I never actually got to try any fondue here. It was my husband's birthday and I thought I'd bring him here using a Groupon. We didn't have a reservation and the snotty-ass, blonde hostess told us it'd be a 30 minute wait. She told us we could go sit at the bar if we wanted. Why we had to wait at all I have no clue; the restaurant was half-empty with plenty of available tables within plain view. So we waited until 8:30, examinating the confusing-ass and outrageously priced menu. No one ever called us or gave us updates about being seated at a real booth. I felt so bad since it was my husband's birthday. Finally we got bored of drinking ice water and left. As we were exiting, Ms. Blonde Snot didn't even ask why we were leaving and the other hostess, a male, said, \"Bye! Thank you!\". The wait staff here are totally rude and aloof. I don't know if that's how they're trained to act, trying to keep up with the over-priced menu and the overall hoity-toity ambience and look of the place or what.

I also find it funny that business manager \"Marie M\" suggested to buy the \"Endless Entrée\" dinner option in order to have a half-way decent dinner as her response to the other reviewer. If the 2-course dinner isn't really worth it, why is it on the menu? lol

The good news is that we went to Carraba's instead and had an awesome dinner that cost us only half of what this place would have. The staff were so attentive and cordial."}
{"text":"I have dined at Melting Pot's in Washington & Arizona. The food is the same, but this is by far the best service I have ever experienced. Manager, server & busboy were all very attentive. I dine out at least 3 times a week & our server, Christine truly knows how to provide an excellent dining experience!"}
{"text":"I have been here only once and it was for my best friends birthday.  I made a reservation but it was unfortunately late in the evening because I made it late.  I expected there to be more people since I was told that the only time they had available was 915pm.  I was ok with this but only because it was for my besty.  We arrived and were quickly seated.  Since it was her first time they went over the whole shpeal about how it works.  We started out with the Wisconsin Trio Cheese Fondue.  I had never thought of bleu cheese in a fondue but boy was this rich and creamy.  We thoroughly enjoyed every last bite.  The only dipping item that I didn't enjoy with it was the uncooked broccoli.  We then moved to the Cesar Salad.  The parmesan encrusted pine nuts were so good we spent quite a bit of time talking about it.  We then got the Land & Sea and a side of the teriyaki-marinated sirloin.  The fun of cooking the food soon became apparent.  She had thought that this would be tedious but quickly warmed to it and enjoyed finding the perfect cook time for the shrimp so that the tail slid right off.  She enjoyed finding different dipping sauces for each of her meats and for the veggies.  The night quickly moved to dessert.  When we were kids we would stay up late and watch horror movies and melt chocolate and peanut butter so The Original was a perfect match for us.  By this time we were fairly full and had forgotten to save room for dessert.  But we ate it anyway.  I love the dippers that are provided.  The strawberries are always fresh and sweet, the bananas were good (based on my friends review, again with the stupid allergies),  The cheesecake was rich and creamy, Rice crispy treats are always good and then add peanut butter and chocolate and heaven is tasted, the graham cracker encrusted and oreo encrusted marshmellows are wonderful and I wish I knew how to make them, the poundcake was divine and the brownies were rich.  Needless to say the dessert was a hit.  The price is high but worth it.  Had to take a star away for the late reservation even though they weren't very busy.  The waitress was ok but the experience at the Scottsdale location with the flambe was an added enjoyment.  It is a nice location."}
{"text":"This was the first time we had been to a Melting Pot. It was fun and different. Everyone was helpful explaining what we need to do.  We each did the 4 course entree.  The cheese part was a little too boozy flavor for us but it was good.  The spinach salad was amazing!  Highly recommend that as a salad.  Hubby had the Cajun main and I had the regular. The filet was our favorite of all the meats. The chic part was really good. We both walked away stuffed.  We will come back."}
{"text":"I just spent the evening with my new grade level teaching team at the Glendale Melting Pot for a year end celebration. What better way to end the school year than with a bunch of melted cheese and chocolate, well, everything huh?-lol! We laughed a lot and shared great times. The restaurant is dark and pretty. Great bonding place with friends and I can imagine a very romantic date place. The food is good. This is a unique dining experience. At first I was like, \"Ok I don't like cheese that much\", and, \"that sure isn't even close to enough food to fill me up.\"  Ummmmm, yeah. Ummmmmm, no problem there. It is the next day I am still fully stuffed here. We rolled out of there-lol!I loved every bit of every course.( I really want to go back and try the lobster with the Caribbean style cooking oil. After I hit the lottery of course!) YUMMERS too to the chocolate treaties at the end. 

   Tom the waiter was very accommodating. We were a bunch of crazy, wild woman there and he treated us well. Now a hint for those who don't know about this place. It is very expensive. However, to fix that problem Wahla!l it's restaurant week in Phoenix. So for 30 bucks, plus tax and tip per person, you can share the experience with a preset menu deal.( you can purchase upgrades too)  Lovely evening. Enjoy! Bonjour!"}
{"text":"It's only worth it for the $5 per person per pot happy hour, otherwise it's just overpriced for what you get.  The only cheese fondue that I ever get is the artichoke one, and my favorite chocolate fondue is The Original, which has peanut butter in it.  One of my gripes about this place is that if you split the pot with more people, it is like you are paying for less amount of fondue."}
{"text":"First time at the melting pot, environment was nice however for what we paid I could of ate 4 steaks and some lobster, left hungry, if you enjoy a great snack that you have cook your self this is the place. Very over priced, would not recommend this place."}
