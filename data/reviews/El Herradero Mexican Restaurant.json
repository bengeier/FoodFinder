{"text":"I used to work for a securities company & a coworker came back with food from this resturant. She said it was pretty good, and I went to try it for myself, and have been going back ever since then, and that was more than 5yrs ago. It is a little hole in the wall, but it is undoubtly my favorite Mexican Resturant in Vegas, and I have tried more than half in the city. The staff is always smiling and friendly, and I love their chips and salsa, usually with a glass of iced tea, their Chicken Burrito with rice and beans & Green sauce is my absolute favorite, but they also have good chicken taco's and their chimichanga is delish! Everything on their menu is good, I have taken many family and friends there, and no one has complained yet! You have to just go by there and try it for yourself. I really like it, they have had the same cook there in the A.M. for all these years, and he sooooo kicks ass! You will probably leave there with a smile on your face and a very happy and full tummy! Viva El Herradero! :)"}
{"text":"El Herradero is among the top of my list of authentic mom-n-pop mexican restaurants.  My father first introduced me to the restaurant while I was in high school and I've been coming here for about 10 years now. The staff is very warm and friendly, the environment is clean and the service is fast. You can dine in or take out and there's also a nifty little salsa bar too. My favorite things to order are the chimichangas and the menudo. Also there is plenty of seating so bring a friend if you want to check it out sometime."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food! Has been around forever! Small family feel and seems like you're not even in Vegas. The chips are excellent! Check it out."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I was disappointed with the food. No flavor!! From chips and salsa to the rice and beans. Very bland. Service was good."}
{"text":"Very delicious authentic Mexican restaurant! Great service and yummy! It's a small place but it's cozy and you'll love the home style food with good prices."}
{"text":"In complete contradiction to previous reviews, El Herradero is exactly the very mediocre kind of place you would expect to find hidden in a strip mall. The clear plastic tablecloths and no-budget décor accurately reflect the food quality. A stale basket of chips complete with an errant and quite ancient looking French fry arrived at the table accompanied by a slightly sweet, less than fresh salsa. The chilled ingredients dominated the Carne Asada Burrito making for a cold dish even though it was Enchilada style and heated before served. Pathetically weak Enchilada sauce tasted like something watered-down from a can. The tortillas seemed store bought as did the commercially shredded cheese. Average fast food, neighborhood-Mexican? Maybe. 5-star Mexican restaurant? Definitely not."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. My wife works right up the street so we head here for lunch when we can. I love the Chicken En Chipotle, it is spicy and full of flavor, but don't order it unless you can stand the heat. The tacos are solid too and the wet burritos are great. It can get busy at lunch so be prepared. It seems like most of their biz is during lunch. Maria is one of the servers and is a gem. Be nice!"}
{"text":"This was a nice place. Busy for lunch. Sweet hostess/waitress. Good was good. Not exceptional but good. Will be back. Prices are decent."}
{"text":"How do you say DELICIOUS? EL HERRADERO! Yummy! Try the Chili Colorado or the Chili Verde!"}
{"text":"It's is one of the best small Mexican restaurant I have been to. All of their food is awesome! I recommend it to all my friends and their prices are affordable. Trust me I'm Mexican and I know my Mexican food. Although, there are other bigger Mexican restaurant in Vegas and I have tasted them and yes they are ok and very nice but trust me the food is awesome here. Too bad they are closed on Sunday."}
{"text":"Service was great. Ordered menu and it smelled really bad. TIP FOR COOK.... presoak tripe with lemons for 15-20 minutes before cooking. Rinse and proceed as normal.  Food could use a l more flavor"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh food and friendly service. The churros are unreal. Also, vegetarian options are good!"}
{"text":"Casual. Food is very well prepared.  Tastes like it was made at home very wholesome. Love the  Chile Verde pork with cactus.  Tried the beef and vegetable soup. Blown away. Just rich, perfectly spiced and so comforting.  Perfect for a cold winter night."}
{"text":"My burrito was soggy and did not come with the rice. The rest of my order was incorrect. The delivery charge was NOT worth $8.99. I'm from the Midwest and so far, there aren't many if NONE authentic Mexican restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas.It's a small place, in a little mini-mall behind a convenience store, on Warm Springs and Spencer. The food is so delicious and at a great price. Nothing greasy or fatty. Just great flavor and excellent portions. Whenever I'm in the area, and feeling hungry, it's my favorite place to stop to eat in, or pick up to go."}
{"text":"We come from an area where good \"Mexican fast food\" is a dime a dozen, so we were weary about trying a place in Vegas. El Herradero did not disappoint. Not many places put real cheese on nachos anymore and bake it in the oven. Loved that! I would have liked more meat on the nachos, but besides that, yum! The green sauce is the best. My only complaint is they close so early! If you're feigning for some Mexican food at a great price and you're on the south side of Las Vegas Blvd., they're worth a visit."}
{"text":"Dining room is always clean, service is always friendly & prompt. The only gripe I have is with the flavors of the food being bland."}
{"text":"Tried this place for dinner last night, it was super good. Great albondigas, and the tamale was amazing! I will be coming back for sure! Very authentic."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time and had it delivered. Food was delicious!! Very authentic. The rice was the best I've had in a while- fluffy, not over cooked and not too much condiments, just perfect!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Totally homemade.  The real thing. The only downside is no alcohol, but that's why it's perfect for lunch.   Must try: Pollo con rajas crema! Pollo con creme chipotle! Chilaquiles!  The Milanesa was good, but I would ask for sautéed onions with it next time.   Also, they serve breakfast all day.  Who doesn't love huevos rancheros at 3pm?"}
{"text":"I am not sure how this place has 4/5 Stars. I have never been disappointed in a authentic Mexican restaurant. We ordered the macho nachos and the carne Assad burrito. The nachos were dry and lacked flavor and I didn't like the pulled beef that came in it. The salsa they gave us with the chips I had to put on the nachos to try and add some type of flavor and moisture. The carne Assad burrito with every bite I bit gristle and eventually had to stop eating it. The rice was over cooked and mushy in the burrito as well. I can see now why we were the only ones there eating. I have defiantly marked this off my places to eat."}
{"text":"Good, solid Mexican food right near work. Try the Macho Burrito covered in Chili Verde.  Oh, and I almost forgot: free Wifi."}
{"text":"I have only ordered here a couple times , but so far so good.  The chimichangas were excellent, flavorful tacos, rice and beans, and the Carne Asada steak plate was tasty, we will order again when we wnt takeout Mexican food."}
{"text":"Fantastic - wanted to grab Mexican food nearby the airport - friendly service - Chile Verde and Mole were both tasty."}
{"text":"Very dissatisfied with my service today. I paid almost $7 for a breakfast burrito, and waited for over 20 minutes with only two other customers in the shop. Do not come here if you are in a hurry. I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and tried the tamales. It was pretty good though they drowned it in sauce. Looking at the menu they're a little more pricey than I like so don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Been coming here for quite a while now and I just realized I hadn't yet left a review. I've had a large variety of things on the menu and I've always been incredibly pleased. Plus the owners are so nice, as are all the rest of the employees. Come here ASAP!"}
{"text":"I chose this place because it had decent reviews. I was not pleased with the carne asada. I was tough and lacked flavor. My husband's meal was mediocre as well."}
{"text":"Finding delicious, traditional, Mexican food in Henderson and south Vegas is a chore to say the least. This place solves that problem. The girlfriend and I were looking for a traditional Mexican restaurant that served breakfast before 11am. This came up on Yelp and we decided to go.  We both ordered the Chilaquiles with steak and, my god, was it fantastic. The spice level was perfect (not too white, but it also won't take the enamel off of your teeth), the steak was tender and grilled exactly the way it should have been. Their coffee was strong and fresh, and the chilaquiles was blended like an artist has done it. The tortilla chips in the meal weren't too soggy, but they weren't to dry either, there was plenty of cheese, the egg was exactly as we ordered it (over easy) and the grilled onion finished off the deliciousness excellently.  The service was also friendly and fast. Based on this one experience we will definitely be back for many more meals here. This might just be my favorite Mexican restaurant on this side of town.  What are you still doing reading this review?! Go there... now!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas.  The Chicken Cilantro soup is a must have with every meal.  The service is quite friendly, the food tastes very fresh, and the menu has a great variety of traditional and Tex-Mex cuisine.  If you didn't know it was there, you would miss this gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place they are so friendly and clean has the best food n their rice and chips are so good the family likes the fresh homemade salsa they may be hidden in the back but worth finding the menu has many to choose from price is right too"}
{"text":"I work so close to hear that I am surprised I haven't tried it yet. So far, I've only had a chicken macho burrito, enchilada style with salsa verde, but it was fantastic. I will definitely be exploring their menu more in the future."}
{"text":"Hands down the best authentic Mexican food I've ever had!!   Went to Las Vegas for a week long vacation, we got hungry while out exploring and stopped at Taco Bell, we met a Police Officer in the parking lot and asked if he knew of a good Mexican restaurant. He recomended El Herradero and I'm so glad he did! It's a small family restaurant, the staff is very friendly & polite.   The chips & salsa were great (all salsas made fresh in house), we ordered the Chile Verde with nopales which was hot but good, and the Carnitas which was sooo good! Both came with your choice of flour or corn tortillas, fluffy delicious rice & beans that were not overly smashed. We went back a second time because it was that good!! This time he ordered the Carnitas plate which he loved & the Camarones al mojo de ajo which was heavenly... I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants authentic Mexican food at a fair price."}
{"text":"Muy buen restaurante y la comida sin grasa, me encanta! el servicio es excelente y muy profesional!"}
{"text":"Food was just ok. I order the chicken soft taco combination plate. I've had far better here in LV. Nothing about it stood out to me above the rest.   They weren't lying when they said their XX spicy sauce was XX spicy. I liked that!  Ordered my food here on Yelp24 and once I arrived, I was told they didn't have any churros left (although I paid for one). She handed me $1.50 in cash for the churro, but I realized I paid $1.75. I won't be returning here."}
{"text":"Small little place.  Kinda left unsatisfied and still hungry. Spent around $11 on a soda, 2 tiny enchiladas with refried beans and rice, and free chips with salsa. They had only one server and a cook who doubled as the bus boy. Not a lot of taste going for the enchiladas and the salsa was ok. One plus was that food got there pretty quick after being ordered.  Ask for little ice with your soda, they brought me a large cup of ice topped with a few gulps of soda, finished before I even got my food, and wasn't offered a refill. I'll stick to where I usually go for Mexican."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food in Vegas... or on this side of town!!  Tiny place , family run. GREAT Chili Colorado. They do run out , it's THAT good! Dessert are great also."}
{"text":"Went with the house mole! Was amazing! Great hole in the wall location if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I shamelessly order the same thing each time I go (carne asada sopes).  My husband has tried a few things, but he loves the menudo. It's also nice that they have menudo daily instead of just Saturday and Sunday like many other places.   It's confusing when you walk in, but if you're eating in, it seems they prefer for you to pick a table and they will bring you menus, versus ordering at the window."}
{"text":"Very nice people and great food! Got warm chips AND a salsa bar...that's my type of bar....also dessert bars are nice as well.   Back to this place, cheap, fast and friendly...pretty damn good these days."}
{"text":"I like this place very convenient,  since I work next to it! They have this soup call SO CHI  it's a real pick up soup, if u have been sick or if u just want something  soothing in ur stomach."}
{"text":"Don't know how this place has 4-5 stars. Slow and bad service, food quality is bad for price, chilaquiles plate and tamal were super greasy and beans were cold, had to ask them to reheat. Food was bland. This is far from authentic Mexican food. I'm not going back to this place."}
{"text":"I love it :)it's authentic and delicious I enjoyed it mmmm so good!! I definitely recommended if you want some good Mexican food"}
{"text":"People are not kidding when they say this place is hard to find. Squashed in a nondescript strip mall and hidden from street view by a large Circle K store, it's very easy to drive by this little jewel (as I have been doing for 3 years!) I came out of my fog when a co-worker suggested this hole-in-the-wall which, he raved, served the best Mex-o in town.   Full disclaimer: I do not know good Mexican food. I am from the MIA - I CAN pick out a good black bean, the ultimate croquetta and a mean cortadito (sniff... I miss you, little one) with the best of them. I can also tell when someone's cooking with love... and L-O-V-E is what is going on in that kitch! Guac was fresh -- like, melt in your mouth fresh -- and gone in about 5 minutes flat. My fish tacos (lightly battered and flash fried) were perfection. And, the icing on the cake (no, not the Jarritos)... the fresh sauces these folks make daily -- the verde is my fav, though I don't mind some of their fire-colored goodness when I'm feeling a little sassy. ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent food, please come and eat here if u are looking for a Mexican taste, I love this food, thank u so much"}
{"text":"Food was very tasty; however, I asked for no cheese because my children have a dairy allergy and one dish had cheese on it and we were unable to eat it."}
{"text":"Went back to this place for the fourth or fifth time last weekend.  I can't get enough!  Great every time!  I did notice that they slightly raised their prices, but its well worth it!"}
{"text":"Wow! This food was very good. Fresh and expertly flavored. I will order again and again. Very large portions that are shareable.  Give them a try."}
{"text":"Really good traditional Mexican food here! Love this place, one of my favorite dishes is the Burrito plate! Can't really go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"I just finished eating carry out tacos and I was very pleased. I tried chicken, al pastor, and carnitas. Very authentic Mexican tacos. They were $1.85 each. Loved the salsa bar with 3 delicious kinds of salsa.  The place is kind of hidden in a little strip mall. Small place, not a lot of tables. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"3 time to order from this restaurant. Everything is delicious. We ate like true Texans. Family of 7 ate for $90 which is a great deal when ordering food delivery.   I love TexMex but whatever they call this type of Mexican food is so delicious. Recommend to anyone who are tired, or tired of room service to try out this restaurant. Food portions are big and lots of left overs. Will order tomorrow just to make sure I get everything out of Vegas that I was looking to buy and eat!!"}
{"text":"I had the carne asada tacos here the other day and they were bomb!!! Only $1.99 but I paid the extra 0.50 for all the fixings and guacamole. They are messy but that's because they load them up with a ton of guac. The food is filling and authentic tasting. I think they only lasted about 30 seconds because they were that good. I will be back for sure. I'm a taco monster!!"}
{"text":"The salsa is super good and very fresh. Portions are huge so come hungry. Very affordable and delicious!!"}
{"text":"First, I wish I knew they did NOT have their LIQUOR license before going: maybe it's just me but an ice cold Negra Modelo or margarita go hand-in-hand with great Mexican food!  But then the food was not great so maybe that's why. Ambiance was lacking too (removing the thick plastic table coverings would help).  Tasty? Absolutely! El Herradero will do in a pinch when you're craving some south-of-the-border flavors, just know the quality is mediocre if you're a Mexican cuisine foodie."}
{"text":"I've been searching for authentic Mexican food since I moved here from Cali. The food here is always on point. It's a family owned business and the interior isn't fancy but the food is cooked fresh, delicious, and the service is always friendly. My husband and I love going here anytime we crave Mexican."}
{"text":"This is a whole in the wall place. Usually my favorite to try. I was very pleased to know they use oil for their beans since I don't eat meat, except fish. They had plenty of options for me to try.   I went for the nachos. They were loaded and delicious. My BF got the chicken and steak tacos. He loved them. His came with chips and salsa. The salsa had a sweet taste to it which i didn't like but my BF did.   We also order a churro which was somehow perfectly cooked. I haven't had one that delicious since Disneyland.  The service was wonderful. The food was great. Price was cheap. I will definitely come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"We ordered for delivery the other evening. It was too costly for a couple of meals.  I got a chicken chimichanga and it was delicious. The meat was awesome and the flavors were great. I'll crave it for sure. The hubs on the other hand...got an asado burrito. We asked for no onions-it had onions. TONS of them. Wrecked it for him immediately. It also had beans in it (black or pinto, he's not sure which) which is not to his pleasure. Some of the meat was also non-chewable. Hubs was not a happy dude."}
{"text":"Yummy this is a hidden gem. I love  their soups. Food is very reasonable. I have been going for years. Quick and good."}
{"text":"For authentic Mexican food this is one of the better selections in this area.   The meals are all very reasonably priced, the food is quite good service is nice and friendly, and over all is is a great experience."}
{"text":"Small family owned place with great food.  I had a the grand burrito with beef, sour cream, guacamole, rice and beans inside and it was awesome.  The beef was a healthy portion of super moist and tasty pot roast.  It was covered in a delicious red ranchero sauce which completed the great taste.  My wife had chicken in a sour cream sauce with chipolte served with rice, beans and tortillas and she enjoyed it as well.  The service was quick and friendly and we will certainly eat there again."}
{"text":"Excellent hole in the wall Mexican restaurant. Food was hot, fresh, got the table quick, and service was great. Clean restaurant, authentic Mexican atmosphere, and overall a great experience."}
{"text":"It's ok.  Standard zero atmosphere place, no problem there. Food is just average, or maybe below. Prices are ok for dinner, but seem kinda high for lunch. For way better food at a slightly better price, I would go down the street to Tacos y Tortas el Panzon."}
{"text":"This is one of those 'you will miss it if you blink' type places. Hidden in a strip mall, behind a convenience store, you will find El Herradero. Best Mexican food I have had in Nevada, hands down.  The same lady helps me every time I go in, and she is a total sweetheart. The decor is basic, this isn't a place you would take a date for a special occasion, don't go into a hole-in-the-wall establishment expecting fine china or 800 thread count table linens... If you have ever been to Mexico, you know that it's the flavors of the food that make it authentic, not the décor!   The chicken soup is fabulous. Great broth with lots of chicken, potatoes, carrots and rice. It tastes extra yummy when you are hungover. I also like the chicken tacos and taquitos. Basically anything with chicken is going to be great.   The free chips and salsa you get when you sit down are also tasty. The salsa is mild, but that is how I like it... They have a small salsa bar as well for those that like it hotter.   Make sure you get a churro for desert. Yum!"}
{"text":"I had the tacos, it was very delicious and tasty.  This is a whole on the wall, place is nice. Very friendly staff, will definitely return to try other items in the menu!!!"}
{"text":"For some reason I'm on a Mexican crave kick this week. This is that mom-n-pop place that doesn't mark up the prices you can have a fine dining experience. I love that! The couple are as sweet as an be, and you simply cannot be in the place without hearing a customer comment on how delicious the food is. And they are all so right! It's always a preference thing, but my preference is to have fluffy Spanish rice and well cooked but not soupy refried or whole pinto beans. I also like the option of a very hot salsa. That's exactly what you'll get here. And I love the addition of grilled onion to the al pastor tacos (in addition to the raw ones in the pico). It really adds another level to the already delicious taco. My other favorite is the #9 caldo de pollo with pico and avocado. Personally, I don't like chicken on the bone. No bones here, it's shredded.  It's not as busy as it should be, come on yelpers - don't be shy- give them a try!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from this place tonight.  I've seen it many times but never tried it.  We ordered tostada's, tacos and a chimichanga, all chicken.  The food arrived along with a bag of tortilla chips, a side of guacamole and some pico.  The tostada's were very soggy and soft almost like a cooked soft taco, not a crunchy tostada.  The Tacos were really good and the chimichanga, I've seen much larger, but it was good.    The chimichanga came with rice and beans.  The chicken was very tasty and well seasoned.  The side of guacamole was awesome, really surprised at how good it was, very impressed...great tasting chicken, guacamole, the Tacos, wow.  The rice and beans were the down fall as they were very bland.  The rice lacked seasoning and the beans also were just very bland.  I would order from here again but not get the rice, beans or chips as none of these were very memorable.  I guess the only memory of those 3 items were BLAND.  Everything else was amazing and I would try this place again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. It's an authentic mom and pops place. I love their #2 chicken with a light creamy spicy sauce. I can't remember what it's called.  Chips and salsa are great. I've had their soup, taquitos. I haven had anything I didn't like yet.  It is located in an odd little shopping center.  I don't think I would have ever ventured had I not gone with coworkers the first time."}
{"text":"This place is really good. It's been here for over 10 years and has not changed at all. The menu is amazing and very authentic. Very small place. Great menudo! All the food is sooo  good. Try the Diablo shrimp!! The prices are also very cheap."}
{"text":"Only tried the huevos ala mexicana!  Great dish! Very authentic! Just enough hot to make your eyes and nose run but not so much that you can't breathe!  Seem to be family owned.  Man and woman in the back putting out some great looking dishes!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Sometimes, you just need a good ole' cheese enchilada, and this place delivered two delicious ones! The guacamole was also very tasty. I usually like my guacamole pretty simple...avocado, lime, and salt. This had much more, and it was still fantastic!  I read a couple other reviews about the beans and rice being bland. Perhaps they altered their recipes since then because I thought both were really good. And...so much food.  Delivery arrived exactly when stated, and the driver was super friendly. I will order again from here in the future."}
{"text":"its ok.. the complimentary salsa was just pico de gallo.. so if you are looking for good salsa go elsewhere..  and since most people are looking for good chips and salsa I'm sure a bunch of people will be going elsewhere.. although the service was very good, the waitress was polite,music was way too low so i could hear everything every customer was eating..  the tacos were ok nothing too special but when you add the cost.. it cost me 8 bucks for 4 tacos the tacos end up being horrible.. i love tacos and for that very reason i will never eat at this place again.. rubios, and el pollo loco are far better for the price.  lower the price of your tacos or make them better and ill come back"}
{"text":"We did yelp delivery.  It was delivered within the time given.  Food looked good.  Chili verde was flavorful and very spicy.  The shredded beef taco was good and spicy.  The tamale was presented nicely without the traditional corn husk and was my favorite of the three things we ordered.  Beans and rice was good too.  The salsa was wonderful.   I am from California and am used to excellent Mexican food and this restaurant was pretty good."}
{"text":"Better for take-out than lingering for atmosphere. My friend of nearly 40 years came to town from Philly, seeking \"Mexican\" like we enjoyed in Colorado as college students. Thanks to Yelp, I found El Herradero - not far from my home in Anthem. The kitchen is fantastic with great dishes and no 'attitude'. Superb value.  3 stars for the food. The dining area is so-so."}
{"text":"I took some work-related classes in the building across from this place. I came here because it was convenient to my location and judging from the reviews, others seemed to like it, plus I was craving mexican food that day. I had asada nachos, it came out to almost ten bucks, a few dollars more than the asada nachos I usually get from my fave taco truck in LA so I thought it would be comparable at least. I was so wrong, for almost ten bucks I got a plate of about 20 store bought tortilla chips (that's what it tasted like anyway), hard cheese, a few slices of asada, lettuce, onions, beans, and sour cream. It was more like the nachos from Taco Bell, except I like Taco Bell's version better. I was starving so I doused it with lime and hot sauce and went on my merry way. You're much better off making your own nachos at home or even going to a  gas station with a Food Mart IMO. The two stars is for the prompt and friendly service. Based on food alone, it would be -1 star."}
{"text":"This was the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Well the one bite I took.  Not only did my chicken chimichanga taste bad, it smelled bad.  My daughters said her food made her stomach hurt. The beans were watery and the rice wash mushy and flavorless. I have no idea how this place has decent ratings.  It's awful"}
{"text":"I live right down the street from here. I have meaning to stop by and try this for some time now. Located in a strip mall I expected to find it to be like a fast food kind of restaurant . I sat down and a nice lady took our order and brought it to the table. Our food came to our table pretty fast. I ordered enchiladas and rice and it was all really good. I enjoyed my lunch very much and will return."}
{"text":"A real deal authentic Mexican restaurant near the car rental return center in Las Vegas.  You can get a full menu of Mexican food, all for under $10 and the portions are big too.  All of your entrees comes with homemade chips and salsa and the standard beans and rice.  Note that the restaurant is hidden near a gas station and strip mall."}
{"text":"It is hard to find in this shopping center behind the gas station but it is worth it.  Family owned and worth every penny. Stop over for some real food !!!"}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall little place! Staff always great and foods always delicious! I live for small places like this, authentic Mexican food yumm!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Amazingly fast delivery! We will definitely be ordering from here again! Portions were HUGE we will be having this happily as left overs.  The price was great for the quality and amount of food along with such a fast delivery."}
{"text":"Should I preface this review with my usual, \"I don't usually go for _______\" and then go into the reasons why I like this place? I am known for choosing the second option if given the choice, but I have been more open when it comes to this cuisine.  Having worked in a Mexican restaurant for three years. Keep your jokes about the role reversals to yourselves. That is probably one of the reasons why I am not that fond of food from south of the border. I am the minority in a group that loves Mexican and Tex-Mex food.   Located behind the convenience store, this place is easily overlooked if you are not searching for it. I almost didn't find it even though I was on a mission.   The restaurant was empty, so we were the focus. It probably would have been the same if there were others there as well. The lady working the front was friendly and quick to check up on us. As soon as we sat down, we were given a basket of chips and a bowl of salsa. Both are bottomless. They offer a salsa bar, but none of the other salsas taste as good as the pico de gallo.   We had ordered water to drink, but when she came back I was surprised that she brought bottled water. It is a dollar, if you don't want to pay, make sure to clearly state tap. This just added to the authenticity of my visit. I pretended that we were in Mexico and it was unsafe to drink the tap water.  Thanks to a friend, every time I go to a Mexican restaurant I wonder how their carnitas are. I ordered the slow cooked pork in a burrito with guacamole and asked for it smothered in the green chili sauce. The burrito is large, stuffed with meat, rice, beans, and a good helping of the green stuff. It was fantastic. The pork was juicy without being too fatty. My only complaints are that the carnitas were overly seasoned and none of the salsas packed any heat. If not for the other ingredients, the burrito would have been extremely salty. My friend had ordered the vegetarian burrito with the same extras as I. She loved that they had sauteed cabbage in addition to the normal peppers and onions.   For both of our meals, it came out to twenty one dollars and some change. I would not think twice about coming back here again."}
{"text":"This is a great little neighborhood Mexican restaurant, I had the Cocktail deCamoron with extra avocado.  We also had that you know that the Carna Asada burrito, the food was really good!  This place is definitely a hidden jewel I would recommend this place to everybody."}
{"text":"Always delicious, salsa is the bomb, love the friendly girl who is always working. They will make whatever you dream up too! Chile Relleno burrito is the best! Tiny ,casual type restaurant, usually get mine to go but the service is great when I stay."}
{"text":"The waitress is always smiling and the food is consistently great !! Love the chips and Salsa!! Now they serve free soup too !!"}

{"text":"Since I work in the area, I have passed by this restaurant on quite a few occasions. I finally got the chance to try it out since my coworker was craving a bean burrito for lunch.   I opted for the three taco lunch special which comes with three tacos of your choice and a soda. They have hard and soft shell options. I chose the hard shell chicken taco and two soft with carne asada and carnitas, just to get a little sampling of a few options. My dining partner ordered the burrito special with chicken. The chicken and carne asada were pretty good, I was a little disappointed by the carnitas. All the tacos could have used a little more flavoring as they seemed a little on the blander side, but there is potential. I added some of the salsas they offer at their salsa bar, which only consists of three varieties (medium, hot and verde) and that helped. My coworker said her burrito was just ok. She had hoped it would be a little on the cheesier side.   Overall, I had a pleasant meal and I look forward to giving this little shop another chance soon since their prices seem pretty reasonable and they have a relatively extensive menu."}
