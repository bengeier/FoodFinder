{"text":"Ever crave just one piece of pizza? Not an easy situation when you are out in the 'burbs & the option of mall pizza isn't striking your fancy.  I was thrilled to stumble across Flying Wedge for just that reason!    Tucked away in Quarry Park (wedged between Riverbend & DouglasGlen) is Flying Wedge.  It is a Vancouver based chain, that seems to have an interest in expanding out this direction.  While I cannot claim that it is the best pizza ever, it is a welcome change. Their menu is vast, with lots of interesting options (Asian & Indian inspired pies), as well as old standards (Tropical Pig - their version of the Hawaiian classic.) You can walk in & buy by the slice if you like. Also have online ordering if you are looking for a full pizza to take home.  There are a lot of rotating promotions - details are available on their website.  $10.95 for all you can eat pizza & fountain drink on Sundays! (I know a few of you will be interested in that.)  Staff are friendly. It has always been clean when I've stopped in.  For what they aim to do, they do it well.  Worth dropping in to check it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I'm an old-school Wicked Wedge pizza guy from The Red Mile so my initial reaction to Flying Wedge was that it might be a suburban offshoot and I was excited. Unfortunately it is nothing like Wicked Wedge. Although they do have good deals and a decent menu, the pizza is barely passable. To be honest, I'd rather drive to a mall for pizza or chance a wait at Coco Brooks than try this place again. If you're drunk I'm sure it does the job but otherwise I'd avoid it. 16/30"}
{"text":"Love this place. This pizza is so good. The varieties are great!  Not sure what the other reviewer is thinking. This place isn't related to wicked wedge. This is a BC franchise."}
