{"text":"Absolutely my favourite Vietnamese restaurant. And I've eaten at well over 40 Vietnamese restaurants in and out of The GTA. My favourite dish of all time if I had to pick one would be Bun Bo Hue. And these guys make it the best. Second to none. No competition. The beef in this dish is very flavourful which easily sets it apart from other restaurants that make it but put in 1/10 the effort. I have eaten at this restaurant for 14 years, since they were at their old location down the street. Now this new location is stylish, comfortable and spacious, with the same outstanding flavours they've always served. They are clearly a restaurant that can withstand the test of time. Always almost a full house, so you don't question the quality of food but you should always get a table without the wait. Servers are attentive and helpful. The place is clean. The prices are reasonable. What the heck more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Always a satisfying meal here.  The food is excellent and the service is friendly and very prompt.  I alway enjoy ordering the vegetarian red curry with rice, which they make very well.  Our son just loved the spring rolls and roasted pork."}
{"text":"Food was good, but nothing special. Cantonese chow mein was too gooey and oily for my taste, but the pho was yummy. I wish the broth could have had more flavour though. It didn't taste salty enough for my tastes.  The waiters were all very pleasant, but super quiet and they looked a little tired. If you need something, like takeout containers, you'll have to flag one down when they pass by, since they don't check up on you.  The atmosphere was very nice for a Friday afternoon though. It wasn't too noisy and it was very peaceful with the light pouring in.  I have had tastier pho elsewhere, but if I'm ever hungry and in the area, I would return here as it was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Food was good. I think they have one of the best pho in  the city, can't say the same for their krystal roll (needs improvement). I think they need to renovate a bit. I've tried some of the other food, but I usually only go there for the Pho. Staff is friendly, though forgetful at times. I would recommend a try!!"}
{"text":"Great Pho: the noodles,the broth, The beef the,chicken...a real delight, but was not impressed with the service, but isn't it all about the food,right?"}
{"text":"Been coming here since it was where Foodie North is now.  A solid Pho place, favorite dish there is the sizzling pot tofu. Good service, good for groups. As a vegetarian their menu is good, there are some good options here."}
{"text":"This is my son's favourite pho place. We eat here weekly. Their pho broth is quite good, especially when you dine in. Pho just never tastes as good when ordering for take out. The service is fast and efficient. The space is clean, and not as cramped as most Vietnamese restos. I do feel that ever since they moved from their old location the food isn't as consistent. There fore the 3 star rating. Still one of the better Vietnamese places in Sauga."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious! The pho broth is the best I've ever had. Also love the salad rolls and herb wrapped beef rolls! A very busy restaurant but service is very fast."}
{"text":"I come here almost every week with a group of friends and we all universally love the pho here.  Portions are sufficient, the price is relatively low, and the service is quick and speedy.  Everytime I go we are greeted and treated in a courteous manner.  Even with picky friends with special orders, they get things right (no onions, no shredded pork, extra egg, etc etc).    Their rice dishes are a bit more pricey, but their pho is worth it.  The broth is thick, fatty and tremendously flavoured.  It's almost as if they kept every beef bone thrown into that pot and simmered until the marrow melted.  They offer copious amounts of meat with the pho's and plenty of lime, basil and bean sprouts.  The meat that comes with the typical rice dishes is sometimes a bit small or charred, but their fried rice is pretty flavourful.  Definitely would recommend for the pho alone."}
{"text":"Fav pho in Sauga! The pho is very good and that's what I come here for.   Don't get the rice dish since it's not broken rice. There are better places for the broken rice dish."}
{"text":"This has always been one of the favourites for my family. Hence, I will do my best to not give a biased review. So once you walk in, there is rarely any wait time, and you get seated right away more or less. The restaurant is at the corner of the intersection and is relatively big. The restaurant is decently furnished, but could be more comfortable in terms of lighting, it has a sorta \"cool\" atmosphere whereas I prefer \"warm\" ones.  The wait time to for food is alright, sometimes faster than expected, sometimes a little slower than expected. The pho is simply awesome, the broth tastes very deep and natural, and the ingredients are usually fresh. The noodles are very soft, and it is complimented by fresh slices of well proportioned beef. I always get their special dac biet pho which comes with all assortment of their meat. Their drinks are okay as well, but obviously not the best place for drinks. The proportions of their dishes/entrees are about standard.  Now, admittedly, some of their non-pho things such as their crispy spring rolls are over-fried (I even got a sore throat once), and their other dishes such as bbq pork on rice are great but not spectacular. So I guess for other vietnamese dishes, I would prefer eating elsewhere.   However, I can honestly say that I have not tasted better pho anywhere else, and visitors can also note that they don't feel too thirsty after eating pho there (indicating a lack of msg).   Pho sure I would also go here for pho in mississauga, and I can guarantee at the very least the pho wouldn't disappoint. Notice how reviewers who gave 1-3 stars didn't try the pho. When it comes to pho, it's the real deal here. Pho real."}
{"text":"Unbelievably fast and incredibly attentive service. My glass never got a chance to go below half-full, my order was taken almost immediately, and my food took no more than a few minutes. I ordered the classic bahn mi, which seems to also be classically priced. It was delicious. I've had the pho here too, and I really love pho, and can say that this is really good stuff"}
{"text":"Golden Turtle has gotten so much better with time. Definitely the best PHO in Sauga now. If you haven't been in a while, make sure you give them another try!"}
{"text":"Since I use to come here often during my lunch breaks at high school, I figured it was time to write a review about this restaurant; I'd like to inform people that they recently changed locations to the T&T plaza on Central Parkway West.   I like their new location; it's much closer to my house. The interior is more spacious and definitely cleaner & newer looking compared to their previous location. As for their pho, it's okay; I usually order an XL Pho Dac Biet and the broth had too much MSG for my taste. The meat and pho noodle ratio was not balance as they gave way more pho noodles than meat.  In terms of food, what I like better is their rice and vermicelli dishes. My favourite dishes are the BBQ chicken with fried rice and the BBQ pork chops with steamed rice (I sometimes order a fried egg with these dishes). Each dish comes with a side of soup from their pho broth.  Overall, I like the rice and vermicelli dishes better than the pho but that's because my mom's homemade pho will always be #1 to me so I guess I'm a little bias from that standpoint."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times and the broth has gotten worse over the years. It used to have flavour and is now just filled with salt and msg. I'd recommend another place to satisfy your pho cravings."}
{"text":"Food is really amazing, and pretty consistently prepared. I go there at least once a month, and maybe every two weeks in the summer because the patio is so lovely. However, service is thoroughly indifferent. Write down the wrong food item number and correct food description and they brought you the item number? No refunds, no replacing with the thing you meant to order. Nonetheless, the service isn't the main event and the food is excellent so I feel a four star review is in order. Fav items: spicy satay shrimp cold vermicelli, deep fried spring rolls, vietnamese iced coffee."}
{"text":"When it says \"Cash Only\" on the menu cover, you already know this place is gonna be pretty authentic. Overall, the experience was good. I wouldn't say that the Pho is much better than the competition, but it satisfied the craving.  Everything came out at the right temperature and tasted fresh (the deep fried spring rolls were delish).  Being in the hipster Ossington area, you know you're paying a little more, but still worth it imo."}
{"text":"There are numerous Vietnamese restaurants in Mississauga but this one always seems to be on people's top five best. I have been here in the past but I decide to do a review based on the last visit over the Thanksgiving long weekend. I had the pho with beef flank, tripe and tendon.  Overall it was a good meal. The portions were large indeed. Lots of noodles and plenty of beef strips and tripe. Tendon was smooth and tender. However the biggest win is they sprinkle very little cilantro! Overall a place to visit when you are in Mississauga. And only 7 mins drive from Square One."}
{"text":"Fav pho restaurant in Mississauga.  Eat from here at least once a week. If not, I get take-out which is usually a rice dish priced at 7$. Portion is huge. The usual for me is bbq pork chop and chicken.  The owner is very nice. My family and I are regulars so he always greets us with smiles and conversation. I don't remember how many times he's asked me how school is. Lol. He means well though.  The pho here is soo good. The broth is perfect as well as the meat. I hate onions in mine, so I always put \"no green onions\". They never accidently add them. The noodles are typical to other pho restos in sauga, thin. I prefer thicker noodles found d/t, but these ones are still good.  Definitely try the deep fried spring rolls. Another fav.  Shakes are good too. I LOVE the coconut one, as I believe they add coconut milk in it as well.  Comfort food at its finest."}
{"text":"Hands down best spring rolls and pho soup. This place has been around for quite sometime but is one of the best pho places in Mississauga. The place does need a facelift though."}
{"text":"Best pho broth in Mississauga! Always order the 102 with a mango smoothie. Also, don't miss out on spring rolls and Chinese donuts."}
{"text":"No matter who you ask, everyone has Golden Turtle in their Top 3 Pho places in Mississauga. I've been to several other places just because of friends or the convenience but this specific location is my family and I's absolute favorite, from the service to the food itself.  To me pho here tastes the best. Noodles and meat always on point. I always order the spring rolls with my meal and they always taste great. Sometimes I'll order the pork chop on rice and it's just as great. The rice is addicting. The pork chop is juicy and flavourful. Another must is the mango milkshake. An all time fav. My mom also loves a few of the other entrees. She enjoys trying new ones when she doesn't feel like pho. The food also comes quite fast. My family can be in and out of there in 20 mins if we really need to be. Lastly, the service is impeccable. You can tell the owner genuinely cares about you, he even recognizes my family from before they moved locations and will mention if he's seen one of us some other time in the week. His hospitality is also reflected in his staff as the lady behind the counter also recognizes us and greets us with such a sweet welcome every time. I love this place. I will always choose to come here over any other pho restaurant in the gta and my friends know it too"}
{"text":"I Have Been Here Before And I Sometime Go Here All The Time Because I Know The Food Is Going To Be Good. ! ? I Try There Fried Rice With Grilled Chicken Or Grilled Pork Chop,Shrimp Muffins And Deep Fried Spring Rolls. ! ? It Was Good. ! ? I Hang Out With My Family And Socializing With My Parents. ! ? The Service Is Great. ! ?"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite pho place in the GTA. Have been a regular there over 10 years. The service and quality of pho is top notch. Prices are very reasonable. Would highly recommend the Tom Yum soup."}
{"text":"Nice open space with tasteful decor.  We were seated promptly and the place was busy at lunch on Saturday.  We ordered pho (101 and 111), steamed rice rolls and jackfruit shake.  The service is pretty quick but they seem rather disorganized.  Wrong orders brought to tables.  Large trays holding large bowls  of soup intended to expedite food delivery are accidents waiting to happen.  The tray is too big to fit on the table so the poor guy has to wait for someone to come take them off the tray and put them on the tables.  The food quality is the same as their original location."}
{"text":"I had my chicken pho, which everyone makes fun of me for.  I loved it. Very fresh taste. Broth was clean. Spring rolls were cruncy and tasty. Service was great. I would come back here again. Good prices. Good food. Way better than Pho 99. Chain resto's have nothing on this home style place."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile.  Was pretty busy for a Sunday lunch crowd.  Mix of young and older folks so it appeals to all ages.    Ordered the cold coconut and bean slushy, chicken wings, grilled chicken vermicelli, and assorted meat chow mein.  The grilled chicken was delicious as it came as one nicely grilled juicy piece of chicken with the usual sides and  vermicelli.  I would definitely eat that again!  Chicken wings were fresh and crispy.  Chow mein was what I expected for a viet place trying to keep Chinese happy.  My mother liked the bed of crispy noodles and the veggies were crispy, but the sauce was too runny for our tastes.  Definitely come back for the traditional offerings..."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Vietnamese cuisine. Taste not bad, slightly bit more expensive than other Vietnamese places I go on a regular basis. I guess considering the location, need to charge bit more. Service could be improved."}
{"text":"Pho is okay and prices are decent. Staff at this restaurant are actually all Vietnamese (not one of those chinese-owned restaurant). Serving is friendly and fast. Mine came within 10minutes after placing the order. Soup can be quite oily sometimes."}
{"text":"I came here about a month ago and wasn't very pleased.  I ordered a curry beef dish and while this was my fault, I didn't know it didn't come with rice.  However, I was eating by myself and not many people eat curry without rice.  This was something the waiter should have picked up on this and told me it didn't come with rice.    However, this wouldn't automatically get them two stars.  What really annoyed me was that asking for white rice was very confusing for them.  It took about 5 minutes for them to come to my table and then when I inquired another 5 minutes later, they said it was coming.  So they re-heat my food and then there is still no rice! I had to ask 3 times for white rice. Ridiculous.  In addition, this place is dirty (even though it is new).  Overall, there are much better pho places.  I'd rather to the Pho Mi 99 or Pho Queen city than this place."}
{"text":"There's quite a bit of Pho places in Mississauga and I tend to go to Pho Mi 99.    However, I like this place as well and mostly because of how close it is to me.   Likes - the pho and the broth.  I think the broth here is a lot tastier than Pho Mi 99, however I think it's because it's heavy on MSG.   Dislike - the ambiance.  I tried eating here and maybe it's just me, but it's a bit of a dark, depressing atmosphere.  Not really somewhere I would take friends.    Overall - great for takeout, good for dine-in with close friends, but not somewhere I would take people who are picky on atmosphere."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best pho place. Great service and food. I usually order pho and fried rice with pork chop."}
{"text":"Solid place for Vietnamese food. Very consistent in their quality - pho, vermicelli, curry, and rice plates. They provide generous portions and good service.   Having had Vietnamese food for over 15 years in various restaurants all over the GTA, this place is one of my favorites - especially their seating and parking. The place is very spacious so you almost never need to wait for a table, and you can always find a parking as it is right across from T&T and Second Cup."}
{"text":"The meat they use in their PHO is top notch.  Overall, the pho quality is good to excellent, although noodle is overly cooked.  As far as other dishes go, they are mediocre.   I am ok to go there, but not enthusiastic."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants in Mississauga. Every time I come here, I think about getting something different but always end up ordering the Pho, its so delicious.  A great place if you're looking for authentic Vietnamese food at an exceptional cost."}
{"text":"Interior decorating is an art. The previous tenant, After Rain, turned the space into an elegant, modern looking Japanese restaurant. When I heard that my favourite pho restaurant at the time was moving locations here, I was excited to see how Golden Turtle would utilize that same space.  And I ended up super disappointed. They stripped whatever character After Rain brought and seemingly cut as many costs as possible. The result was a much cheaper looking restaurant.   The food was still solid, but is no longer my go-to spot for Viet food in the city. Pho Queen City has that title now."}
{"text":"My personal favourite place to go for pho.   The broth is tasty, beef is always on point, and the noodles are good. I get the House Special every time.   Aside from their pho, I've found that their Thai chicken curry is also very good. Complemented with steamed rice and fresh salad, it's another great option.  Their spring rolls are crisp and fried well, but not so fresh.   Overall, I always come back to this place for the pho. Having many other good dishes is just an added bonus."}
{"text":"So many great reviews for this restaurant. I decide to bring a my family and give it a try. So far so good. Order placed. Food arrives. OMG!  The plague!!  Flies. Flies everywhere. No more flies.  Need a fly swatter. Need bug spray. Flies in the air. Flies on the rice. Flies on the pork chops. Ahhhhhhh!  Let this nightmare end!   We went on labour day and the place was empty except for the stinking flies.  Did I mention flies?!  Full staff but no service. I think it was the FLIES!!  The staff didn't want to attacked by the flies. Holy crap flies!  Deep fried Flies!  Do flies barf on your food?  Lay eggs???!!  Damn Flies!  Never again."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Mississauga.  The Pho broth is great and meats are fresh. If you want to taste Pho as it should be, this is the place."}
{"text":"Let's face it - pho restaurants are a dime a dozen in Mississauga. For many years one could find a pho restaurant within a 2 kilometer radius anywhere you go in this city.  It must be owed to the entrepreneurial spirit of Vietnamese immigrants who migrated here during the late 1980s and early 1990s who brought with them the iconic beef noodle soup that the working class back in Vietnam consume on a daily basis. Pho is to the Vietnamese people what pizza is to Italians, or pho is to the Vietnamese people what sushi is to the Japanese, and so forth.   You get my point.  My inside sources tells me that the Golden Turtle in Mississauga originated with the owner of the first Golden Turtle on Ossington street in downtown Toronto.  Or vice versa, I think. What I am sure of is that somewhere in this lost tale is a story of great pho.  The difference about this place versus the other restaurants in Mississauga is the broth here is freshly made with very little MSG used. (Don't kid yourself, everybody uses MSG)  Having an inside source at this place, I can also tell you that the old broth is often discarded the night before and a fresh batch is cooked each day - that is why when you eat here, you are able to witness a clearer flavorful broth that fulfils the aroma of your senses as you slurp down this iconic Vietnamese beef noodle soup.   Freshness like any other foods are a must and Golden Turtle definitely excels in providing a pho unlike any other in Mississauga.  Try their deep fried spring rolls as well, crunchy but a little heavy on the oil side - you can request them to not use as much oil.   They also offer a mean vermicelli with grilled beef and grilled pork meatballs sprinkled with tangy sweet fish sauce, another Vietnamese staple!  Golden Turtle is the de facto place to be in Mississauga for a very good bowl of pho and if you are a mother-\"pho\"-king lover (see what I did there?) this place must be on your list to try if you love Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"Since there are so many Vietnamese places in sauga, I get very picky on the food quality and the price. I believe this restaurant is reopened after they reallocated to this new location a few years ago. The past reputation for this place was very good. However, I have been this place twice now. The first time was a couple of years ago. I was a bit disappointed because my expectation was set too high based on my friend's' recommendation. The price was high and the taste was too salty.   Due to the request of my friend, we revisited this place. I was hoping that the food quality can be improved no matter if they have changed the price or not. Unfortunately, it was fairly the same but if I'm to be honest, it is a bit worse.   We ordered two types of pho. The first one was with the meat balls. The medium size order is good for a regular individual, but if you are very hungry, the large size is recommended. It seems like the noodles were immersed in the water for too long, they weren't chewy at all. The taste of the soup was very plain. The second pho was with vegetables. As you may see in the photo, it was pretty much the chopped vegetables were thrown on top of the pho, not pretty and I had no intention to try it. Compared to the BBQ chicken I had in another two places, the one here wasn't flavorful at all.   The server was very limited in English when we asked him to give us any recommendation for ordering."}
{"text":"Good food, served hot, friendly staff. The restaurant was a little too calm and quiet. The restaurant needs more happy and talkative staff, and clients to liven it up. But I will give 5 star because staff are nice to me:)"}
{"text":"This place got more expensive and the quality has significantly decreased. The soup lacks noodles and meat. And vermicelli for 11 bucks has broken noodles and poorly made meats and spring rolls. If rent is too high they should find a new place with lower rent and focus on food quality."}
{"text":"- Food was okay, the pho is legit  - portion was decent - not small not too big  - atmosphere typical of Asian food places - prices were okay on menu  Biggest complaint was that the restaurant applied a 18 pct gratuity for a 5 person party, this is atypical for the group our size and the tip amount is excessive for the service"}
{"text":"Good but definitely not the best pho place in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Probably the worst pho restaurant I've been to. The floors were disgusting.. looked like they haven't mopped their floors since before the winter. There was still little bits of onion from the previous people. One of the tea cups were really dirty, had to ask for another one. Also, there was an eyelash in my pho. So grungy. Never going back there again."}
{"text":"I used to frequent the old location. It was my favourite pho place out west for several years even though there is a plethora of options in the area. They always had that dirty, dingy, only surviving by a thread but somehow so damn addictive kind of feel to them. However, since the move to a much fancier, cleaner and more upscale location they are no longer the same.  Somehow, the soup stock while is still familiar has deteriorated quite a bit. The noodles are not quite done to the perfection they used to be. The flavours are there but somehow just muted and lesser of.   I was careful to not write this review after my first visit to this new location as things seems to have changed so drastically. I questioned whether they've changed their chef or ownership but that wasn't the case. Anyhow, after several visits since I do notice there are marginal improvements to the food but still nowhere near the quality that it was before. Unfortunately, it seems while they've upgraded their appearance they've also lost their soul. I am hopeful things will turn around and they bring back the glory days of the past."}
{"text":"This is our fallback pho place when I love pho is packed. Pho broth is always tasty here. I'm a fan of the soft tendon and they're always generous with the portions. Vermicelli dishes are also good here and my personal favourite is #119 pork and seafood mixed noodle soup. Staff are always fast although some servers have little to no English."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years. Great pho, as well vermicelli and rice dishes. Note that this location will be closed as September 29. Re-opening sometime in November in a new location (Central parkway and Mavis area).  Looking forward to the new location as the decor here is less than stellar.   My only complaints are: 1. The Thai curry dishes here are way too small. 2. The men's washroom is absolutely freezing in the winter."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 1999.  It's the cleanest, best customer service and most tasteful pho in Mississauga.  I will never eat pho anywhere else.  People speak english well."}
{"text":"Although I enjoy Pho 99 ... Golden Turtle is very good.  They have more beef and much more tender beef than Pho 99.  Been here a few times now and the service is great.  Even for Sunday lunch, the place was packed and service was so quick.  Delicious pho broth too."}
{"text":"This place is great, but not quite as great as it was at its old location. The food is pretty much the same, but I think the service has taken a hit since they moved to the new location. I always liked golden turtle pho over other places because the broth just has an extra something that makes it fantastic. It's like almost 'minty'. The broth is what makes the meal, so its the most important factor. This place has the best.  I'm sure once they get their sh-- together with the new location, it will once again be a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place got such great reviews.  It was alright, pretty solid, but not worth 4 stars imho.  The restaurant has definitely seen better days.  Paints peeling in some places, graffiti in the restrooms.  The food was fresh though, and pretty tasty.  Nothing tasted off.  I got the shrimp rolls and the pho dac viet large.  Nothing really stood out as being way better or way worse than other places.   I found the service to be so-so.  Sometimes, I felt like the servers were passive-aggressively ignoring the customers, but then they're just getting minimum wage, so what do you expect?   Personally, though I think with all the other asian food choices available in Mississauga, if this place isn't bringing their A-game, then I would rather take my business somewhere else."}
{"text":"I personally work at a Pho restaurant myself and I honestly think their food at this place is terrible. It's a huge disappointment because it's a well known fancy restaurant. The portions are extremely small too. I had fried chicken and honestly couldn't finish, it tasted so dry and old. My sister got a pork rice plate, there was four times more rice than meat, and barely any fish sauce, a normal person would need more than 4 times that much fish sauce to eat all the rice they give you. My dad got pho, and the the brought out a tiny plate of bean sprouts. I was so surprised because I usually give 4-5 times that amount at the restaurant I work at. Even the pork tasted terribly prepared and stiff."}
{"text":"Golden Turtle is a great find for me in Mississauga.  I have long wanted to find a Vietnamese restaurant that tastes like how things were 2 decades ago.  I also like the aroma of fish sauce hitting my nostrils before I am seated.  Golden Turtle delivers on both accounts.  I ordered a BBQ Chicken on Rice, and my BF ordered a Red Curry Fish with Bamboo and Eggplant.  The BBQ chicken was actually grilled lemongrass chicken.  The Chinese name more accurately describes this entree.  The lemongrass chicken tasted *perfect*.  It was tender, sweet and with an aroma of lemongrass.  I wish there was more chicken, because there was about 2 bowls of white rice that came with the chicken.  BTW, the fish sauce that came along was undiluted, which was exactly how it is supposed to be and how I like it.  The Red Curry Fish was tasty.  I cannot attest to its Thai authenticity but it tasted bold and creamy.  There were lots of bamboo and eggplant, but it could have more fish.  It went so well with white rice that too bad you must order the rice separately.  BF solved this problem by eating half of my rice.  (And with this help, there still was just enough chicken to go with the reminding rice).  Both my BF and I were pleasantly surprised by the services.  The waiters were very polite and well spoken.  They didn't just place the plates onto the table; they tried to present the plates nice and neat in front of us.  And after we had finished, a waiter asked us how we found the food and if we liked it.  My BF and I were like \"wow\".  If only the portion of the protein (fish and chicken) was more in proportion with the overall entree and the rice, the food would be 4 stars on its own easily.  As it is now, food 3.5 stars.  Services add 0.5 stars.  Overall 4 stars."}
{"text":"What great service! I've visited this place many times over the years, and I'm always appreciative of their servers. It isn't the fanciest looking joint, but you're always greeted right away, seated right away - all with a smile.   On my most recent visit, our server was very attentive, and we had no problems ordering, getting the bill, and received our food a lot quicker than usual. I ordered a small bowl of beef pho #102, my boyfriend ordered a large bowl of #102, and we ordered the deep fried spring rolls on the side. All were delicious, the broth was very clean, the beef was tender, fresh, and lacked fat, and the spring rolls were fresh and crunchy. On our latest visit, our only complaint was that the beef level of our pho was way too low - there were a ton of noodles in the bowl but they clearly skimped on the portions of beef.  However, overall, great reliable meal. For two people, we spent $22, including tax and tip. Great go-to place for pho in Mississauga."}
{"text":"The menu is too large and they can only make Vietnamese food. We ordered Singapore noodles and vegetable fried rice, neither dish looked or tasted like their name sakes. It looked lime they didn't fry either one.  They brought our dishes out one at a time with 15 minutes between each. My wife asked for the Singapore noodles not to be too spicy and they cooked it without curry.  We will never come back here."}
{"text":"2.5/5, +.5 for the service.  The pho is good, yes. However, as with almost every single pho restaurant I go to, I will always have a bowl that is NOT pho in order to truly compare whether this restaurant has the diversity aspect of Vietnamese cuisine. Unfortunately, it fell short on that aspect.  I ordered the seafood udon, thinking its the Vietnamese kind looking at the translation. However, I was presented with udon that is your typical kind you find in a Chinese restaurant...the low quality kind.  Obviously the bowl turned out to be nothing special, and considering I paid $7.95 the amount of noodles I got was rather small (despite the large bowl). They used an egg broth for this bowl, which actually tasted not bad.  To accompany my meal was an iced lemon tea, which was a little sour for my liking, but I'll let it slide as most Vietnamese places I go to tend to have their lemon teas a bit more sour than normal. I wish I received more pieces of lime though...  Service was excellent. The waiters, despite their slight language barrier, will try and help you out. They actually look around to make sure everyone is served well; never standing around in one section.  Will I come back? That will depend on some other places I try in Mississauga. I plan to visit more restaurants in this city as I usually pass by here when I commute from Waterloo to Markham once a week."}
{"text":"Price was reasonable and if you have time, you can go across T&T and have a walk.  Today we had their beef noodle soups and I was surprised that they gave us more meat in  each of our noodle soup. We also had their deep fried chicken wings. They were freshly deep fried and tasted well with the asian chicken sauce.  Also I think they have the best Viet Coffee...."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened but after they relocated to this new location everything has gone downhill. All the previous employees at their old location are now replaced by new ones. So during my most recent visit everyone was literally walking around clueless and handing out orders to the wrong table.  My family and I always expect delicious pho from Golden Turtle but were very disappointed. It took about 20 minutes for our pho orders to come out. When it eventually came to our table all of the noodles were broken. My dad waved over an employee and all he did was awkwardly say that the kitchen staff are new. My dad replied back that this restaurant has been opened for 20+ years so this is not what returning customers expect. The owner then told her employees to send back all of our orders and make new ones. After another 5-10 minute wait we finally had the Golden Turtle pho we were expecting. We were highly unimpressed and definitely will not be visiting anytime soon.  I hope Golden Turtle steps up their game and clean their new location up because it's quite dirty. The windows and floors are not clean. It's as if they ran their old location into the ground before switching to a newer location. Additionally, I really dislike how they have so much MSG in their broths. You'll get really thirsty after eating there."}
{"text":"My favourite pho restaurant in Sauga. I'm a long time customer of the old location and I did notice many new faces in terms of the staff at the new location. The inside of the new restaurant is a big upgrade compared to the old one. The owner is still the kind, older gentleman who is always smiling behind the bar counter. I didn't grow up eating MSG, but if that's what is flavouring the broth, I like it! Haha. I love #108: rare beef and beef meatball noodle soup."}
{"text":"This is our go-to pho place in our area (especially since we live 5 min away).  I usually get the pho with rare beef and brisket.  The pho is good but not the best I've ever had.  The broth could use more flavour.  I also enjoy the pork chop with giant shrimp.  I love the salty goodness of the shrimp sauce.    Overall, nothing really stands out about this place.  But it is consistent and good for something quick and near.  Oh, one more thing.  It's not the best place to take friends that are vegetarian.  There isn't much choice."}
{"text":"Solid. Not the best pho, but happy to have it in the neighborhood. Don't feel it is as good as the location downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"The pho here is one of my favourite in Sauga. I'm really quite impressed how great the quality of the food is here, despite maintaining the nice low-price aspect.   The broth is just right (not too salty, but very flavorful) and they always give plenty of beef slices. It's also quite obvious that the beef is of good quality, and it doesn't have the chewy and bland feel of many other pho places. The noodles absorb flavor from the broth extremely well.  My family and I also tried the 7 course beef dishes for the very first time here. I'm not of Vietnamese background, so I can't comment on how authentic it was, but nonetheless, I absolutely loved it! (The congee was really great, I'm seriously considering having it again for my next birthday meal)  The only downside I could really pick up on was the portion sizes when it came down to the grilled meat and rice platters. I love lemongrass chicken, and it was definitely very tasty here. (Even a nice barbeque taste and grill marks!) However, I really wish they would have given more than 1 small piece with my $8 meal. Maybe I'm a bit spoiled from the usual 2 huge pieces of grilled chicken at other places.   Overall, when I'm in the mood for a nice bowl of pho, this is my go-to!"}
{"text":"***New Location:  723 Central Pkwy West, right across parking lot of T&T***  Atmosphere:  Ok, this was my first visit since Golden Turtle moved their operations on Nov. 8th.  It's currently located at the old After Rain location, so there's booths.  However, I think After Rain took their nice chandeliers/sconces, so the replacements are too small and sorta shabby-chic look for the restaurant.  For some reason, the windows surrounding the new location were also filthy, filthy, filthy!  It looked as though someone \"cleaned\" them with a spit rag.  Quite unappealing for an eatery.    Also, I noticed that there was NO SIGN of the restaurant.  No familiar wait-staff from the old location.  Food:  I've noticed that prices of pho has been increasing.  A small here is $6.95 and even though this is what I ordered, I was given a large (& obviously charged for a large as well)!  :S  Pho tasted phine, but noodles were all broken.  Tasted better than '99' up the street, although not as good as Mekong River.  Rice/vermicelli dishes are better VALUE.  Rice with pork chops was quite a large portion at $8.95.  Vermicelli looked big as well.  I suspect that with the move came new management due to the different staff.  For a new location, they really need to clean up the outside, get an actual sign to show they care.  Otherwise, I would prefer to go to Mekong River."}
{"text":"The Golden Turtle is a Vietnamese restaurant located in Mississauga and on a Saturday night it is quite busy. We decided to order the  chicken noodle bowl & the rare beef Pho noodle soup   The Pho noodle soup was a large and it was definitely worth the money as it was more than I can eat . Noteworthy what's the broth was a little Oily and that's noodle soup at self-contained lots of Cartlidge.  The chicken bowl was fantastic perfectly grilled tender pieces of chicken so that was definitely a win.  The staff there are friendly and accommodating, because it was a Saturday night I guess it was a little slow in reaching our table to take the order but the food took no time to reach.  The restaurant is very clean and on a Saturday expect it to be extremely busy this is in Mississauga hotspot!  Thank you for the great food"}
{"text":"During our 24 hour stay in Mississauga, we had to make our last meal a memorable one. I read some of the solid reviews and was curious about the Vietnamese food around these parts. So why not?  Both the missus and I got the Pho with Rare Beef and Tendon. We are pho-natics about a good noodle soup on a cold(ish) day and Golden Turtle didn't let us down. The broth had just slightly more fat than what I usually see but the flavor was developed very well. The tendons and beef were plentiful and cooked to my liking. When having tendons in soup, I like them to be soft so I can crush them between my tongue and the roof of my mouth. Yummers!   I tried my cousin's Fried Fish in Pot and it was delicious. That's not the exact name of the dish but you can't miss it on the menu as there are only 3 fish dishes and it's the only one that's served in a pot. The fish had so many different notes: sweet, sour, spicy.. and just lightly fried. It was all perfectly balanced. I definitely recommend trying this.  I really enjoyed my experience here. The restaurant was clean, bright and the service was attentive. It was also bigger than I thought it would be. If I lived in Mississauga, I'd probably be a regular. The pho was great, but the fish made me wanna try other stuff on the menu. Guess I'll have to wait until next time!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in town. Big restaurant, attentive staff, good food. Shakes are good, as are the rice dishes. The nem noung could be better, but the pho, rice dishes, and spring rolls are enough reason to eat here."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch and we ordered the house special beef noodle soup, two size smalls, one for each of us, and the bbq pork balls. The pork balls were good--nothing to write home about. But it was soup that turned us off to this place. Usually the broth for pho is aromatic and nuanced. The broth we got was flat and tasteless--even with the herbs and lime added. The rice noodles in pho usually have that chewy, delicious texture and the noodles we got were rubbery and weird. It tasted like pho from a crappy instant noodles package. Not very good. We spoke to the waiter about it and he offered a different item. So I ordered the vermicelli with bbq chicken, shrimp on sugar cane, and rolls. I've had this dish multiple times and this was by far the worst bowl. The chicken tasted old and definitely not that smoky bbq flavour that one would expect from this dish. Anyway, the waiter came back and said that they were training a new chef, apologized, and invited us back again. But $30 later, this experience has ruined this place for me. Two stars because they acknowledged the chef was in training but honestly, this was a bad meal and they should have done something more, especially since we wanted a delicious steaming bowl of pho--not to be guinea pigs for their new chef."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite pho restaurant. I am not Viet but I can absolutely appreciate the flavours and deliciously of this resto.   I strongly recommend you try it for yourselves to know what I am talking about.   I love the rice with grilled chicken and /or grilled pork, but I think anything you order will be delicious :)   Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Favorite Vietnamese pho restaurant in mississauga hands down.  I've been a frequent visitor to the old location and now the new location for four years, visiting about once a month.  Quite happy that they moved to the new location as the prior restaurant was run into the ground.  Best pho broth by far and this is coming from someone who's grown up in Scarborough and a frequent visitor to Richmond Hill/Markham for Asian fare.  The spring rolls are really great, nice and crispy not like the other sad frozen spring rolls you get warmed up at other pho places.  The owner is a nice man and very courteous and he tells me that they have another new location in Kitchener Waterloo!  If you're in the area definitely try Golden Turtle and you'll be pleasantly surprised.    I'll remember to add in photos for you guys next visit :)  Regards,"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend! It def looks like a dive! But if u want good authentic viet, nothing beats Golden Turtle! Our fave is the meat platter with rice paper wrap! Comes with endless supply of rice paper, that u dip in hot water! Comes with veggies, vermicelli, pickled radish and herbs to wrap in! Must try!  Their pho is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"We've been eating at Golden Turtle for many years, but have only been to this new location twice.  The pho broth is the best in Mississauga and the vermicelli dishes are great, with generous portions of protein.  The servers are very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Delicious pho.  Straight up.  Although I do find the portions a lil on the small when compared to pho dau Bo. Anyways Im a fan, oh and bonus you don't have to deal with the bearded hipster dickheads like at the ossington location!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I go here way too often.  I'm here almost every week.  Love their pho, but I usually always order their vermicelli! Their fried chicken on rice is super yummy as well.  Anytime I'm hungry and just want something to eat, my boyfriend and I always go here.  Never disappoints.  Service is quick as well as the arrival of your order.  Very affordable. The only downfall is the cleanliness of the place.  They could wash their utensils a little bit more as I find some chopsticks to be dirty, tables and chairs to be sticky.  Other than that, food is great and service is efficient."}
{"text":"Came on Labour Day with my family, and the restaurant was quite empty. Prior to that visit, I haven't been here too recently and I'm quite surprised at how much it had seemed to regressed.   I ordered the house special Pho and the broth had a huge layer of fat on the top. It also seemed to lack flavour, which was quite disappointing. Furthermore, they gave us a tiny plate of bean sprouts and veggies that would've fed two people when there were 4 orders of large and x-large Pho. The final draw was when my sister ordered a Banh Hoi dish, and they gave us rice paper with BOILING HOT water in a plastic container. My entire family is Vietnamese, and never have we witnessed the use of boiling hot water to wet the rice paper (the hottest the water should be is lukewarm). The server did not communicate this potential safety hazard, and my sister actually burned herself since she was caught off guard. I'm not sure if it was a staffing issue due to the Labor Day holiday or what, but needless to say, my entire family was extremely dissappointed. Not coming back."}
{"text":"As far as Pho goes, this place is pretty good. Service is quick and the place is clean. I've only been once to the old location, but this new location seems to be doing well and I haven't had a bad experience yet. They always have customers but is never rammed, so I got seated quite quickly, even at dinner time on a Saturday. I'm slowly exploring the menu, starting with the tried tested and true, then moving to the more adventurous foods. Parking is ample, but the speed bumps here are a killer. Leave the sports car at home."}
{"text":"my official rating is actually 3.75 stars and getting better every time. their pho broth is def not as sodium filled as once a upon a time. it does however still contains much of the oil from the beef in the broth which is how i like it. The fresh shrimp rolls were fresh and delicious and maintains that consistency the last few times ive been. you know sometimes you get them and the rice wrap is old and tough. sometimes also the veggies are old. the service is much better now since they have more wait staff since changing owners. you also notice the restaurant is more packed now. this is my new reoccurring spot in mississauga"}
{"text":"Home of the greatest fried rice in the whole worl-well actually I've only had fried rice in Ontario. Still, it's pretty amazing stuff. It's not that crispy rice either, just flavourful rice and bits of meat and peas and carrots. It's honestly addictive. But what's more addictive is the pho.  For the past two weeks my breakfast has been strictly well done beef flank pho from this place and as I write this review, I'm waiting for them to open.  Their pho is incredibly good. Like, well it's perfectly salty, the flavour is perfect (with the added lime and sriracha of course). There's always a generous amount of meat, which I find isn't the in case in other pho places.  The Singapore noodle dish here is pretty decent as well, though it is quite spicy. It's worth trying if you're a fan of that style of noodles.  This is also one of the best places for Vietnamese coffee around here. So that's a must!  Lastly and importantly the service has been great for both pickup and eating in. Very friendly and fast. Which I know isn't always something you find in Vietnamese restaurants. Oh yeah and the prices are decent."}
{"text":"To be fair with Golden Turtle, I am a little surprise how the Pho taste on par with a lot of the other Pho joint places I have visit. Especially in Mississauga where there are not too many Pho joint.  The interior is nice and clean, The tables are not crowded together so you never feel like you are all cramped in even when the place is packed.  The raw beef and tripe Pho large ($6.50) was indeed has a nice broth. The use of star anise and hours of slimmering with beef bones resulted in a flavoured complex taste.  The disappointment is in the noodle. I guess is my personal preference of fresh noodle.. dried noodle never makes the grade! - 1 star  The services is nice and friendly. A nice friendly owned place.  I don't mind coming again when I am in the area and need a Pho fix!!  They accepts Mastercard and Visa."}
{"text":"Friendly folks, quick and efficient service, even if they made a mistake on the order, they quickly fixed it in a timely manner. One of the top two pho places in Mississauga"}
{"text":"It used to be a Japanese restaurant so I finally made it out. The place is very spacious and huge compared to other Viet places. The washroom is super dark and not the cleanest.   Ordered a tom yum rice noodle soup with chicken. It was a decent portion. Everything tasted ok. The three spring rolls were over fried and not as chubby as other Viet places. My partner liked his pork vermicelli.   Came home in the afternoon and my stomach hurt so I had to go to the washroom. It might have been the food.   Verdict: I won't go back. I'll stick to other Viet places closer to my neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We got the vermicelli here and it was pretty decent.  Portions were decent. The restaurant is large and kind of modern inside.  Nothing was particularly memorable here but not bad at all. Your standard Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"I really don't get the hype. Don't me wrong. This is a decent vietnamese place, but there's absolutely nothing special about it. The pho is the usual. I had the vermicelli with spring roll, shredded pork, and bbq pork dish. While the spring roll was a bit unique in taste, it wasn't particularly good... just a bit different."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this place, especially considering there's I Love Pho further on Burnhamthorpe or the Pho Mi 99 in the plaza a little north from this one. The broth of the pho wasn't that great in my opinion, and it wasn't as hot as I'd have liked it. I thought it was just my own bowl, but it was the same for the other two people I was with. I remember when it used to be in the same plaza as the Wholesale on central parkway and confederation and it always seemed popular, but I honestly can't see why. I'm not planning on going back. Noodles were eeeeh, and the table and seats we had felt sticky and gross (and it wasn't a hot summer day).  Overall wouldn't recommend with other better pho places around"}
{"text":"Wow.  I chose to come here because of the 4/5 stars it received.  I guess I should've looked at what the latest review was and when it was given...  Well, I should've known Tim Y's review on 7/22/12 of \"Good viet place!\" wouldn't be sufficient AND the last time it received 5 stars was last 10/22/11.    Things must have changed for the worse since then or maybe the people who frequent there have no taste buds and eat with blindfolds.    My experience was very disappointing.    I had one woman state to me that it's not a fine dining establishment.  HA!  No joke, sista!   But I'm sure YOU wouldn't be thrilled if McDonald's delivered your food extra, EXTRA greasy and burnt now would you?    Now for the service.    I've got nothing ill to say about the guys who waited on me.  They were really accommodating and friendly.  However, the woman behind the counter, lets call her \"Anh or Lan or whatever\".  When I asked if I could talk to the manager, she quivered and with shifty eyes told me the manager wasn't there and that she wasn't it - just the cashier.  Ya-sure.  I hate liars.  Don't like going to establishments with liars running it either.   So instead of just apologizing and taking it off the bill, they recreated another greasy order of Cha Gio but this time it wasn't soo burnt - well done.  NOT.    In conclusion, I still tipped over 20% b/c the guys didn't deserve to be punished but I will for sure NEVER come to this restaurant again or frequent any Golden Turtle place.  Too many other good pho restaurants to check out than some tired and worn out place.  Update:  And, yes, I did have their pho and it was nothing to write home about thus the reason I didn't mention it.  However, I still stand behind that there are other good pho places to frequent than this place."}
{"text":"Would not recommend this place. I usually go to pho hung or pho mi asia. But this was close to T and T so we tried it out.  So many waiters running around but no one paid attention to the customers. Need to train staff better.  Had bun bo hue. Couldnt eat it. So much fat. I couldnt taste the broth, just lard.   The chicken dish was just okay, nothing special but did not come with rice. Honestly what pho place have rice separately and when we asked if it came with rice so we could order it the guy didnt understand us."}
{"text":"Just got back from Golden Turtle and I am definitely a fan of their pho! My family and I have been going here since I was a little kid and we decided to drop by this restaurant this afternoon.  When we arrived there was a small line up so we had to wait about 5 minutes before we were seated. When you walk into the restaurant you will smell their delicious broth and it makes your mouth water. The interior is pretty typical like most Vietnamese restaurants. However, they need to replace the cushioning on the chairs because they were pretty hard...not that I'm complaining, it's more of a suggestion.   Everyone ordered a large bowl of Pho Dac Biet (#101). The broth tasted fresh and seasoned perfectly that you didn't even have to add any hoisin sauce or lime. But since I always add lime to my broth, I added some in. The meat was soft and tender which is a good thing because who likes chewy meat? I usually order a small at every restaurant but I finished the large bowl off and was pretty satisfied. So if you're hungry I would suggest going for a large or extra large.  You should definitely drop by Golden Turtle for some delicious pho when you are in the area."}
