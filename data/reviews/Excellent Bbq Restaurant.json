{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a dozen time and know alot of my coworkers have been here also. This place probably has one of the best BBQ pork rice in Markham/Scarborough... They offer quiet a bit of variety of choices and prices are not too shabby, however they have raised their price in the last few months. Average meal will be around 8 - 10 bucks in taxed. Lots of rice, good amount of meat, usually come with the regular soy drink and soup. 

If you are in the area, and have a huge appetite - I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I order take out about once per month there in the past few years. Their BBQ price has increased and quality is not consistent recently.. hope they will improve as there are much chose in the area."}
{"text":"My favourite BBQ restaurant.  I order suckling pig here every year.   The people are friendly.  There's also a few tables where you can sit down and eat.  The quality is good."}
{"text":"Best Chinese bbq place ever! I have been going to this place for the past 10 years and still remain unbeaten! I bring friends over and everyone get hook up right away. They give out generous portion and everything always taste so good! Nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Literally the best Chinese BBQ I've ever had in my life. Been to renowned places in Hong Kong, this place is still undefeated for me."}
{"text":"Excellent Bbq was average. Visited on a Friday evening, however, most of the meat options were still available. I ordered a combo plate of roasted duck and bbq pork for $9.

The bbq pork was dry and had a weird texture (as if it were old). The roasted duck was too salty for my liking. The self serve onion and ginger salsa was tasty, along with their chili oil. However I do not believe the price point warranted the service or quality of food here."}
{"text":"I come here often, this is the only BBQ place I have been to that actually gives you lean meat when you ask for it. 

Despite being lean, their meat is still tender and juicy, their BBQ pork and roast pork is the best I've ever had. The skin of the roast pork is super crunchy and the BBQ pork falls apart when you bite it. 

Definitely would recommend, the butcher is the nicest I've seen as well. He isn't in a bad mood at all, cuts the meat into good bite size portions and doesn't chest you with the scale."}
{"text":"I cannot understand all the positive ratings.  I never write reviews but felt I had to comment this time.  The meat was fine - very similar to what you can get at any Chinese bbq-type restaurant or even just T&T.  I ordered the lunch combo and got a bowl of soup that was literally swamp water, some tasteless lettuce (I guess you could call it a salad), and some really terrible rice (absolute bottom of the barrel quality and cooked into mush).

The meat was fine...but come on guys, 4 or 5 stars?? Really??  Just because it's cheap and you get lots of it, does not make it taste any better."}
{"text":"The BBQ at this place is awesome! Portions are big and meats are seasoned and tasty! What more can you ask for. 

Each meal here is accompanied with either a tea or soy milk and a bowl of soup. What I usually get here is their number 13, which is BBQ pork and duck. 

Ps ask for more of the sauce that they pot over the meats, it adds so much more favour to the meal!"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ Restaurant is located at the forgotten plaza on Lesile in Richmond Hill. Seriously this place is going downhill as the stores usually close within 1-2 years except the few ones.  Half the shops were closed or empty when I went.  I been to this place throughout the years but the last visit really wasn't that good.   The meat quality is not as good and the pieces are very fatty.  I did ask for not so fatty pieces already for my BBQ pork and Roasted pork but I guess I went late in the day and they didn't have much left?.  The skin for the roasted pork wasn't crispy at all.  The price is a little more expensive than others I been too and as always it is cash only.  The marinated tofu was very good and for 4 big chucks for $1 is amazing price."}
{"text":"still the best chinese bbq joint in town! bar none! ... ive prtty much tried everything on the menu over 10 times (not too crazy about pig heads, duck necks or chicken feet lol). great portions and great lunch combos"}
{"text":"This is an excellent BBQ place. You need to try it to believe it. The duck and BBQ pork is very good."}
{"text":"A hidden gem for those who aren't familiar with Richmond Hill. This place has the best Chinese BBQ in the GTA. I've been to dozens of BBQ and this joint has nailed the marinade. All Chinese BBQ uses the same base of flavors. This place just does it better. 

$9.50 after tax for a plate of rice and choice of two meats. It cost less than fast food but packs Michelin flavors.

This place is a must try."}
{"text":"Here goes my very first review on Yelp!
This place is tiny with about 8 small tables so expect a long wait during lunch and dinner hours. It's an order, pay and find your own seat style. 

The BBQ duck was juicy and delicious...a must try! They didn't give much rice but were generous on the meat. As for the bbq duck rice noodle (lai fun) soup, the noodles were a bit over cooked but the broth was flavourful along with the generous portion of duck, that it made up for that. Each rice dish included a side bowl of soup and a cup of sweetened herbal tea. The noodle soup included a cup of sweetened herbal tea. The only downside was no veggies were included in any of the rice dishes or noodle soup. I need my veggies!

{"text":"My favourite Chinese BBQ place in the GTA!
They really take time to marinate and make sure their meats are cooked perfectly. 

When I go, I usually go for either of the three: BBQ pork, BBQ duck, and roasted pig! For around $9 you can get two meats with rice, and also includes a soup, drink, and veggies! 

Great for a lunch where you get your food almost instantly, as everything is already prepared."}
{"text":"Line moves fast, good customer service, tasty meats and *delicious* octopus. 

Was expecting brusque service since this was mostly a takeout place in Richlane plaza, so I was pleasantly surprised when the lady spoke to me quite kindly over the phone and in person, accommodated my request for leaner cuts of meat. 

Peanut free (but if you order noodles, the free soup may have been boiled with peanuts ~ suggest to ask for confirmation if you / kids have a peanut allergy)."}
{"text":"Excellent portions, good flavors, several different kinds of sauces and combos to choose from and very fast efficient service. This is where I go for my comfort food lunch and it has become my go to place if I don't have anywhere else to think of."}
{"text":"I have been ordering take out for lunch for the past 10 years from here and they are the best Chinese BBQ hands down! 

BBQ pork is juicy and tasty 
Roasted pork skin is crunchy and thick! 

The service is a little abrupt and not very cheerful but it's a small price to pay for such great BBQ."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. I went here to try out the BBQ pork and BBQ duck while waiting for my family doctor appointment close by. They put way too much msg in their bbq meat which you can tell after you eat it. You throat will become really dry and you want to drink lots of water after the meal. I have had way better at other places in North York and Chinatown. My husband also didn't like their BBQ pork much too when I ordered some to take home. Good to check out this place once to try but would not come back. The staff are nice though :)"}
{"text":"Rating is 3.5 stars.

Good BBQ pork, okay roast duck.  Considering the lack of competition in the vicinity, this place could have gotten away with lower quality food, but it doesn't.  My respect.  

What takes down the rating from 4 stars to 3.5 stars is the pricing.  BBQ Pork is $8.99/lb.  Most Chinese BBQ joints in Markham and Scarborough charge closer to $6.99, including the good ones.  Whole roast duck is $1 to $2 more expensive than 2 of my favourite BBQ joints in Markham and Scarborough.

Just so you know - pretty good BBQ food, but expensive."}
{"text":"I love Chinese style BBQ. Got the chicken and duck combo for just under $8. The meat was fresh and was a pretty good portion for the price. Comes with white rice and veggies."}
{"text":"The food here tastes quite good and portions are definitely large. I have yet to successfully finish one order on my own. The staff here is very friendly and loves to chat with the customers, they seem to enjoy doing what they do.

I took off one star because their price point is a tad high, even considering the larger portion. They're probably one of the more expensive shops (compared to other BBQ shops) though still cheap on an absolute basis."}
{"text":"Located in Richlane Mall, a food centric plaza, Excellent BBQ actually does serve some excellent Chinese BBQ!

Unlike most BBQ joints this place does have a few tables and is generally quite clean.  Depending on what rice or noodle combo you order, prices range from $8 to $10.  My Chinese BBQ reviews are usually based on the Roast Pork and BBQ Pork rice combo which comes with the two meats, rice, veggies, sauce, soup and soy milk.  You also can add your own amount of garlic/onion and chili oil condiment which is a nice plus.

Portions are big and the value here is excellent!  The roast pork and BBQ pork were both really tender and pretty lean which is what I prefer.  Some purist prefer a half lean/half fatty version, but personally I much rather have leaner cuts so that is a huge plus.  Skin was crispy and the meat delicious.   

There's always a steady stream of people coming in and the place gets really busy during lunch hours so locals really like this place.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite comfort food places. An asian equivalent of the golden M. This has the gold sign with Excellent in it and also no waiting time required. Perfect for people with hungry gastro and an appointment to catch (literally) Choose from  an array of combinations. Have them quickly prepare your meal and your served with a heap of Barbecued Meat on Steaming white rice with vegetable and soup on the side. You are given the option of either Tea or Soy Milk . So far we've tried the roasted pork, Barbecue pork & duck. All worthy of their Excellent name. The lady behind cash isn't exactly all smiles but she is not rude , she's also quit efficient and that counts more for me."}
{"text":"The 2 pick bbq meat option with rice is $8.50 after tax
I ordered the 2 meat option with bbq pork and roasted duck. The combo comes with cabbage as a side, chinese soup and a glass of soya milk. The duck was really crispy and had minimal fat between the meat and skin. I requested for the bbq pork to be served the pork half lean half fat which was just right so you wouldn't be stuck with tough chewy pieces. The pork was roasted just right - the meat was juicy and tender. The sauce was amazing with rice, I almost wanted to eat all of it. 

My boyfriend ordered the 2 meat option as well, but had bbq pork and roasted pork. The roasted pork skin was super crispy, like chips!! The roasted pork meat was tender and not dry. My boyfriend requested the bbq pork meat to be served lean, which surprisingly wasnt dry and the meat was still tender.

Definitely my go to spot uptown for bbq pork!"}
{"text":"As their English name suggests, this is an excellent place for Chinese bbq in the otherwise uninspiring \"Richlane Mall\". One of the first things you notice when you walk in are the two portraits of former Prime Minister, Jean Chretien and his wife dining at the restaurant. 

For $9.50, I got the roast pork-roast duck on rice. It comes with soup and your choice of soy milk or \"cooling tea\". The BBQ is served with a few veggies and a heaping portion of rice. The rice is served with sauce/drippings so you don't have to worry about it being dry. You can also take as much hoisin and ginger scallion sauce as you'd like. The BBQ is delicious as the skin of the roast pork stays crispy, and has a nice balance between fat and meat. The roast duck also has nice, crisp skin, and tender meat. Neither are too salty. You really get your value from this place; the meal can even be separated into two if you have a small appetite. This is probably my favourite Chinese BBQ joint."}
{"text":"I walked by Excellent BBQ Restaurant numerous time and I always wondering why this place always has a line up? 

There are sit in area for people decide to dine in and Chinese TV shows would keep you companion no CP24 though. The area looks clean with no that everything are dirty and sticky feel of a lot of other BBQ places I been to!!

Price point is a little more than the Scarborough BBQ place I been to.. but for that $1 or $2 the food are both better in quality and quantity.

BBQ Pork/Roasted Duck with rice ($6.99) came with like 2 huge bowl of rice, I have to ask them to just give me half portion. The set also comes with a soup and a drink. The duck was really meaty and lean, not the boney and fatty leftover part I usually get! BBQ Pork was on the lean side but not too dry.

I was so full after just eating all the meat ..  burping!

Cash only!!"}
