{"text":"Ordered the 'cool noodle with spicy and sesame sauce' and it was decent, nothing special have definitely had better. Service was good considering there was only one other group when we went in. Ordered popcorn chicken and it did not look appealing nor did it taste good."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place with great friendly service. The popcorn chicken is delicious!"}
{"text":"went there tonight for dinner. it's my probably 5th or 6th time being there, the food is good, the service might be a bit slow but the servers are friendly (you just need to be patient if you eat there)  We ordered 3 starters:  1. Fried squid ball (5 balls) $3.99 Yummy! It taste so good. It's crispy and salty. I wanted to order one more but decided to try other dishes.  2. BBQ sausage (6 pieces) $3.99 It's good but nothing really special, I rather have more fried squid balls haha.  3. Sticky-rice cake with peanut powder (9 pieces) $4.49 I asked the server what exactly is it, he said its sticky rice soaked in pig blood, then steam it. I never really like pig blood or sticky rice but I guess I will give it a try.. the sauce is a bit spicy and the texture of the rice cake is chewy and sticky. I didn't like it, but I wouldn't say it taste bad, it's just not my dish =/ __________________________________________________________ 2 main dishes:  1. Popcorn chicken with rice $6.99 - It comes with a little side dish (pickled vegetables and corn). - The portion of the popcorn chicken is really good! They have a larger portion of popcorn chicken compare to the other place. See the picture, there is so many pieces of popcorn chicken. - The popcorn chicken pieces are big, you can actually see the chicken meat inside. (I remember I went to the OTHER Taiwanese place one time, and the popcorn chicken are so small, you can't even see the meat, its purely just the crispy fried batter!) - It taste good! It comes out hot, crispy, and the saltiness is just right!! YUMMY =)  2. Crispy pork steak with rice $6.49 - The pork is pretty good, it's not dry =) - However, the pork is a bit under seasoned. We have to ask them to add a bit pepper salt. - It taste good! But I still prefer the popcorn chicken rice. - There's diced pork, \"red rice\" mixed with the rice. It taste good! Not just some plain white rice.. _____________________________________________________________ 2 drinks: (if you ordered a meal (popcorn chicken rice for example..) you just need to add $2 to get a drink - Tea or Milk Tea) - originally $3.49  1. Passion fruit tea: It's better than last time! Last time it was tasteless (probably too much ice last time). But this time I can actually taste the passion fruit! yumm!  2. Red bean milk tea: It taste funny. Not bad but just not my cup of tea! ______________________________________________________________  Service: - There's a bartender at the bar mixing drinks (he also serve customer), and this other server but she's always at the kitchen busying. So you have to be patient. - They are friendly! They will patiently explain the dishes to you no matter how busy they are.  Food: - The prices are reasonable. Snacks are around $3.99-4.99, main dishes are around $6-7. - LOVE the fried squid ball! Must try! OH Also the popcorn chicken rice =) - The food came pretty fast =)"}
{"text":"Best popcorn chicken and amazing taro milk tea I've ever had. Good to have a try!! :P"}
{"text":"Went to try something new. This place is very good. It gives out a good atmosphere for hanging out and good place to study as well.   - Free Wifi - Clean environment - Tasty food (especially the popcorn chicken) - Takes Credit Card  I also ended up getting more popcorn chicken to take home to eat.  MMMM Pop Corn Chicken. Best Popcorn chicken I ever ate."}
{"text":"I had high expectations...but what a disappointment...I would give this a zero if I could...  Being empty at 9 p.m should have warned me to stay away, but I ignored that and decided to try it anyways. I asked for their signature item(Honey Toast) and it was unavailable for whatever reason.   The Matcha Green Tea was watery and almost tasteless.    Their Marshmallow \"Brick\" Toast was less than an inch thick, and all it had was some peanut butter, bananas and some marshmallow. It took them half an hour to make (with no other customers there) and it costed $5.99!!  Our server mumbles when he speaks. He also had a really bad attitude and doesn't seem to want you there.   Poor service. Poor food. Poor value.  Better off going to the many other Cafe in that area that are much much better than this."}
{"text":"First thing I got to say is that servies is not that great. I've had better experiences at a bubble tea place. Food is okay. When we went in, it was about 8:35, which is 5 minutes after 8:30, and we couldn't get the combo for the meal. I didn't want to argue with the person there, so we just let it go, but for the entire meal, we didn't even get a cup of water, until we asked. Bad service. Anyway, it wasn't like they were too busy to serve us, cause the staff were talking behind the bar amongst themselves.  I ordered the popcorn chicken rice and fried pork chop noodle. First the rice was okay, it had some taiwanese meat in it, so it wasn't plain white rice, and the popcorn chicken was also decent, but differen than what i've had in the past, but decent. The pork chop noodle was okay too, but i would say its a bit under seasoned. I also wasn't expecting plain white noodles with a tasteless broth, literally that's what I got, with the pork chop on the side. Noodle is so so, would not order it again.  All in all, it wasn't that great, had better. I wasn't expecting the service to be so mediocre as well."}
{"text":"I used to go there all the time to study just because it is really close to my place so it was really convenient.  But during winter...omg it is like an igloo in there. I tried to order a hot drink several times and it would just turn cold..and i mean colder than regular room temperature water...in less than 10 minutes.  I guess it is just like any other bbt place..the food isn't that worth it.  if you go, you should go in the warmer months and order their drinks only."}
{"text":"Matcha milk tea and matcha toast is my favorite. Good wifi and really friendly service."}
{"text":"Food: 7/10 Atmosphere: 7.5/10  Service: 7/10 Overall experience: 7/10  The main reason Lohas Cafe is getting a 2 star review (though ranking 7/10 overall), is due to the fact that there are so many other better spots for post-dinner dessert in Markham.  There was nothing wrong with the food/drink (condensed milk toast, black milk tea - standards!) I ordered, but their faults lay in the little things:  - whenever we asked the waitress about something (can we split the bills? Could we get some more condensed milk for the toast?), she had to ask her manager. Her only response during the night was \"I have to ask\"  - the condensed milk toast took around 30-40 minutes to arrive. They explained it was because the toast was frozen (not a great start) - not a deal breaker, but still a negative for Lohas  THE BOTTOM LINE: regular post-dinner spot, but there are lots of other/better options in the Markham area."}
{"text":"It used to be that when I have a craving for Taiwanese food, I seem to always find myself here, but lately I've been going less often. Bit of ashamed really because a few years back, when the original owner actually ran the place, the food was better and the drinks were served fast. Now, it seems like things are not as good as I had hoped. My crispy pork chop was a little soggy which I suspect was due to the fact that it was served on the rice rather than on a side dish like it used to be, and the small veggie dishes accompanying the main course seem cheap and hastily prepped. The drinks was still good and served quickly though. As a side note, the popcorn chicken is just as good as before! Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I came because I never really had Taiwanese food before and also I thought it would be good place to have a drink and chit chat with friends.  We ordered 2 pots of Chinese herbal tea which was very good. I enjoyed that part a lot.  The pots are not huge so it's per person.  We ordered the popcorn chicken, fried squid balls and this veggie dish which were recommended by the waiter.  They were good, but I wouldn't say that it was so amazing that I would have to come back for it.  The service is good and very friendly.  The place was clean and seating was comfortable.  It's not a very big place.   Now for the ambience.  Ummm...It did feel like a library when we walked it.  I guess it was because 2/3rds of the people who were in there had their laptops up and were studying with their friends.  I guess because it offered free wifi so people take advantage of it.  It was just awkward for the fact that the entire cafe can hear every word we said.  I felt the need to talk quietly because of this.  Perhaps they could have turned up the music a bit to get some atmosphere going....just a suggestion.  It just felt a little uncomfortable for us.  I never understood why students go to restaurants and cafes to study in the first place but I guess everyone has their way of doing things."}
{"text":"We came here because of yelp, it was a week night there was nobody inside, and as soon as we opened the door a really putrid smell emanated from inside... Did I go into another dimension?! Why are people saying it was busy when they went?"}
{"text":"Had the pudding bubble tea and beef curry with rice, while the bf ordered the green tea milk tea and beef noodles; we also got a popcorn chicken to share. Overall the food was quite good, (especially the popcorn chicken, which I dipped into my curry and was extra awesome) and I think this would be a great place to go for lunch. Not crazy for the bubble tea though, pretty plain and nothing spectacular. Does lose points for extreeemmmeeely slow service.  Fairly long wait to have our order taken,  the arrival of food and to ask for the bill. Also extremely difficult to flag down someone. The girl waitress is forever in the kitchen area where she can't see the patrons, while the guy bartender/waiter is forever behind the bar and refuses to look up as he puts the drinks together. Overall, will not come here if I'm in a hurry, but might come just to lounge around if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I came here with my partner on a Thursday evening hoping to try the Honey Brick Toast. When you walk in, it's simple decor. There were around 2 tables occupied, so it was pretty quiet. Unfortunately, the Honey Brick Toast was unavailable - which, I was kind of surprised; considering that this seems like their signature dessert plastered all over Instagram. So, we chose the Marshmallow brick toast and a Matcha green tea latte.   I waited about 20 min for my green tea latte. Really slow when you consider that the other tables were already served. The drink was also quite watery... There was also 2 employees. I believe one employee was in charge of making food and drinks - because after I got my latte, my partners marshmallow brick toast took another 20 minutes to come. I was immediately floored when I took a bite out the toast. It was a very very basic toast (squished down on the inside + peanut butter + marshmallows on top (which weren't toasted enough), and a small drizzle of chocolate syrup). I wasn't floored at the food quality itself (it's simple, so whatever) but I was surprised at the time it took to prepare this. Perhaps, the employee was in-training? But still.....the whole waiting process took 40 minutes (I had to do double take at my watch because I was in denial at the wait time of our orders).  Unfortunately, our server told us that they do not take credit either - which I understand, so ask beforehand. So the combination of the entire experience was truly a let down."}
{"text":"Passed up ding tai fung and was not disappointed. Get the \"kwa bao\" (steamed stuffed bread) and the popcorn chicken. Taiwanese enough for me."}
{"text":"I came here today on Nov 1, 2014. The last time I came here was around 2012 where the actual owner was taking over and wassssss WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY better than now.  HOLY COW..  is all I can say..  PLEASSE EXCUSE MY RAGE!!!!!!!!  THE SERVICE WAS TERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIBBLEE!!   There were 2 women as servers, ONE for making drinks, and ONE for taking orders..  [FIRST OF ALL.]. I DID NOT GET ANY SERVICE AS SOON AS I WENT INSIDE.. So.. I sat down, Hoping to get some kind of service.. Guess what.. NONE.. NOT EVEN TEA.  FIVE MINUTES LATER ON A NOT THAT BUSY DAY.. I finally got a menu to choose what I wanted to eat.  15 minutes later. I  AM TIRED OF WAITING FOR A SERVER TO COME SERVE ME.. So i decided to go up to the WOMAN THAT WAS MAKING DRINKS TO TAKE MY ORDER.   I told her i was in a rush and i needed to take my order. She told me \"Please sit down and I will come around\" ( well i've been sitting down the whole time and it didn't seem like i was getting any service at all.. why else would i get up to ask you to take my order..)  Anyway.. She eventually took my order and told me that my order comes with a drink , (black tea or green tea) So then i said  green tea and asked her if there was any extra cost. She told me there wasn't.  So the food (popcorn chicken and noodles) came which was pretty decent, Tasted similar to the last time I came here.  BUT HOLY COW.. the service was so rude.. THEY literally just shoved the bowl of noodles down without mentioning the name or anything and just walked away. Soon after I was literally pissed off because what kind of attitude is that?  So i couldn't stand her attitude anymore I decided to go up to the woman up front to pay.  I was shocked .. SHE TOLD ME THAT SATURDAYS ONLY SATURDAYS they do not take credit card.. (how does that even make sense???) Ok.. So I said can i use my debit card instead? She said, \" Yes you can use your dedit card\". Afterwards the horrible service woman came over and glared and tossed the bill at me and I asked \"why did you charge me for the green tea? because the other woman told me that it was free and there wasn't any extra cost for it.\" SHE TOLD ME THAT \"DID YOU NOT READ OUTSIDE ON OUR WINDOW.. IT SAYS WE CHARGE FOR GREEN TEA AND BLACK TEA\" I mean.. Jesus christ.. I don't have the time to look and read every single poster on your window... when i have to go to work afterwards.. .  So then she yelled at me saying that i  was wrong to not read the poster before coming in, and that the girl that took my order was wrong, and then she even rolled her eyes at me.. like holy shoot.. what did i do? Why is this woman so deadly RUDE.. she also said \" oh $3 for some hot tea is decent.. Where else can you get tea for $3\" ( Well FYI.. TEA IS FREE AT A LOT OF PLACES UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO DIMSUM)  So then.. we argued over the price even though it wasn't necessary..  and then she took my DEBIT CARD AND WASN'T GOING TO GIVE IT BACK..   Because then when she took my debit card she was also changing the price.. Forcing me to pay with cash ..AND THEN I ASKED IF SHE TOOK MY DEBIT CARD SHE SAID WHY WOULD I TAKE YOUR DEBIT CARD...  I was like that's weird because I had it in my wallet a second ago.. then  she rudely said  \"IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT?\" while holding my debit card.   ANYWAY.. PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU SEE A ASIAN LONG HAIR WOMAN THAT IS PLUS SIZE WORKING THERE.. DO NOT LET HER SERVE YOU.. OTHERWISE YOU WILL REGRET ITTTTTTTT!!"}
{"text":"After I've read the reviews i had such anticipation unfortunately it wasn't as good as i expected. The food is good but not something you eat and will want to come back again."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  Small selection for food, but you can add $2 and add on a tea. Food and service is great, and I love the ambience here.  Very relaxing, and great for chilling with friends!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! My sister and I used to go to their shop at times square in Richmond Hill, and we thought it was gone, but then they moved up to First Markham Place. Yah!! The drinks are always really good and made perfectly, the food is really yummy and the service always superb. The owner and his wife always make you feel at home!"}
{"text":"I like coming here for study or when I'm in need of a place to work on my laptop. Free wi-fi. It's one of my go-to places when I need an afternoon snack or late lunch in Markham. Quiet. Clean. Good Asian pop music. The owners are really nice and they'll do whatever to accommodate your needs. You can stay for as long as you like, and if you can get one of their couch seats at the end it's nice and comfy.   Typical Taiwanese menu with an OK-variety of choices of bubble tea.  Personally, I feel their drinks menu choices can use a little expansion, they really only have the most original flavours one can offer as a bubble tea shop from 1999. But their food on the other hand is superb. Genuine Taiwanese cooking, I promise will not let you down. I love their popcorn chicken and I always go for their minced meat rice. At night when the lights are dim, it's a very nice ambiance for catching up with friends or a friend :)"}
{"text":"The service was slow at the beginning even though no one was being served and the restaurant was near empty.   The food was OK. The popcorn chicken was decent. We also ordered the beef noodle soup (average), Taiwanese meat ball (not bad), fried tofu (served lukewarm) and spicy dumplings (not bad)."}
{"text":"This place has really yummy food! Not a lot of people know about how great this place is, so the restaurant is often empty/semi-empty. Which is good for you- no waiting for seats!  The restaurant has nice, comfortable decor, making you wish to stay awhile and chat with your friends or study. There are pillows on chairs and large tables.  The servers are usually quick, except for the occasional times where they're on their phones and not really paying attention.  The bubble tea is average; I am not too fond on it but it's not bad either. Just a little too overpriced for what it is. The minced pork noodles and rice really steal the show here- I think they're the best dishes of the entire restaurant. Not a bad price, but very good food!! Which is the best combo. The appetizers are pretty delicious! Popcorn chicken... holy shit, it's amazing and mouth-watering.  Another bonus- wifi is super strong. :)"}
{"text":"This review is only for their drinks because I didn't get a chance to try their food,  but it smelt good.  The drinks were very sweet and unlike most places now they don't offer a sweet level choice.    My taro milk tea was too sweet and watery! The outside of my cup was dirty as well.  My friend's green milk tea had barely any green tea taste and was mostly sugar.  The decor was nice,  some of the seated could use some mending.  The servers were friendly and available."}
{"text":"I seriously don't know what happened to this place, the quality keeps on getting worse and worse.   This time I've had it,  people need to know...so I'm giving this place a significant decrease in quality of food, quality of service and everything else...   This USE TO BE,  one of my fav places to come at night...for my fav.  Taiwanese salty chicken and noodles...  Came and ordered take out today,  my all time favorite came out soggy and looks like It's been fried in extremely old oil...dark and disgusting...   The usual chicken noodle had an extremely small piece of chicken thigh... it looked like chicken wings....I was not impressed...my friend was like what happened?  Has the owner changed? Did they sell the business becuz it has become significantly worse...   The coffee was like $3.99 for a medium and at first I was shocked on how expensive a Chinese place coffee was.. taste was merely acceptable...   All in all, I'm extremely disappointed and would not come back any time soon...."}
{"text":"Nice decor, prices were reasonable. But food was subpar. Besides the popcorn chicken, not much else. It's a good place to hang and study though."}
{"text":"I like to come to this restaurant because of their purple theme interior decoration.  The popcorn chicken and beef noodles are my favorites at this place.  I usually come during lunch hours or late afternoon.  This place was never busy.  I believe this is a family-run restaurant, service is warm but it needs to be more attentive. I usually have to wait for quite a while or just walk to the bar/counter area to ask for service or to place further orders.  However, this restaurant fulfills my need whenever I am craving for Taiwanese food.  Comparing with Pa Pa Cheng, this restaurant provides comfortable and classy seating."}
{"text":"Food is tasty, the bubble tea is big and good.It has nice decoration with some game you can play with your friend. Free wifi so some people come here to study and can spend hours in here.Love this place"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. The service was horrible!!!  I went on a Friday night - they had about 2-3 servers and 7 people in the cafe when we were there (not a lot of people to serve). We did not get any water after being seated, I had to ask for it once the food was served. My food didn't come with utensils.. so I had to ask for it. I'm not sure if the people were new or inexperienced, but the service was lacking. It was just a constant battle to get their attention because they were so busy chatting and looking at their phones at the bar area...  However, the one star is for the food! The dishes weren't bad - but I've had better Taiwanese meals. The popcorn chicken dish was pretty decent, but everything was really salty!! I got a black sesame milk tea... way too sweet and I didn't really taste the sesame. I could have gotten better food and service at another restaurant for the prices I paid on Friday.  I won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Nice place to sit and chat with friends. Dishes are above average, my favourite there is the deep fried salt popcorn chicken. Juicy and tender. They have this lunch special that comes with a drink. Service might be a little slow but friendly and attentive. Got some really nice authentic taiwanese street food here!  Try it if you're in Markham. I tried their noodles, but I still like the popcorn chicken with rice the best!"}
{"text":"Yep. Definitely not a crowded restaurant alright. I would only suggest coming to this restaurant when it's dinner time and you're fed up with waiting in lines at the other places nearby.  Parking: Oh dear, where do I begin. For anybody who's a little bit familiar with First Markham Place, you know that the parking situation during weekend dinner time is tragically painful. You're lucky to find a parking spot by taking over somebody else's place, when you wait long enough at the same spot and stalk the people walking by. Or else, have fun with circling around the parking lot for many many rounds.  If you're impatient like me, I suggest parking near where the Cineplex used to be and walk a little. There's always parking there, even during 6-7pm on a Saturday, and the walk was maximum 5 minutes for me. But then again, the weather is getting cold, so for some people the stalking strategy may be optimal. Your call.  Restaurant:  Now that you've finally found a parking spot lets get to the food part. Like what many Yelpers have already mentioned, this place is never packed, not even during weekend dinner hour, so you can always expect to find a seat. Don't expect quick service however, the cafe is pretty understaffed, only 2 waiters were there when I came. I was disappointed that they didn't even serve us water when we sat down, so you're kinda forced to order a drink. For lunch (12-3pm) and dinner (6-9pm) they have this combo thing where you pay $2.75 extra to get a drink that's normally $3.99 and a complimentary dessert. Sounds like a pretty good deal, so both me and my friend opted for the combo.  I ordered the pop corn chicken and my friend got the ribs and we tried a little bit of both. The dishes came pretty slow, waited about 15 minutes. The ribs were ok, the flavoring wasn't special enough to be memorable, but I do give it points for being really tender. My popcorn chicken was kinda the same deal, I've definitely had better and more crispy pop corn chicken else where. For me personally it doesn't deserve all the praises from the other Yelpers. You get a tiny bit of veggies in the side. The broccoli tasted fresh, but too soft and overcooked. The corn was definitely made from frozen packages, pretty bland and soggy.  The taro milk tea that I got with the combo was made from powder, but they size was big and I think the container was cute. My friend's ginger tea was too sweet and it did taste like ginger. The hilarious part was that even though the tea was already sweet enough they even included an extra pack of sugar on the side. Just imagine not tasting the tea beforehand and added the pack of sugar in...... The desserts that we got were those pudding cups that you'd normally see at AYCE sushi restaurants, not bad, not spectacular either.  The bill ended up being like $12 per person before tips, with the combo, so it was alright for a casual dinner. Like I said before, this restaurant is never packed so it is a good alternative to go to if you feel like lining up for the other places. I ever saw people bringing their laptops there too."}
{"text":"Nice place for some BBT. Got the coconut slushie and white peach slushie with lychee jelly. Both tasted good.   Service was escellent because we were the only customers there. I wish they had coconut jelly for my coconut slushie. That would have made my drink even better. I guess if I ever want coconut jelly in my BBT I will have to get it at Chatime."}
{"text":"Parking sucks at this strip mall and the lot is full of bad and aggressive drivers.  When I come here I always regret not buying A tractor trailer or Mack truck so that I can drive like I've gone postal...for the purpose of fitting in of course....lol  After we finally find a parking space...loha's always makes me feel better with their almond milk bubbletea.  Oh....how I love thee.  Sweet, refreshing and always makes my troubles seemingly melt away.   Food here is also good.  We usually get the beef noodle soup and Dan dan noodles ....yum yum yum.  But my trips here are more for their bbt.  I will come here again..but only during the day when the owner is there...he makes my bbt the best :)."}
{"text":"Lohas cafe is the reincarnation of Fancy Cup @ Times Square.   This place is quiet little spot that offers great bubble tea for a cheaper price that that of the big box bubble tea stores. Lohas can accomodate maybe two large groups of people that's it. It's made for smaller, intimate groups.    Bubble tea is better here, I think it has to do with the fact that owners care a lot. Their taro milk tea is really taroy without being sweet. So they know how to balance the flavour without it being too sweet.  One of  the more unique offerings are their sodas, which are italian soda - Chinese style.. yumm.. for about $4.   I usually come here for their bubble tea, so I haven' t tried their food; but their condensed milk brick toast looked pretty good and smelled pretty good too.  Also, if you pick up their business card, it's a stamp card the back if you want to go take out.   Lohas offers free wi-fi, (ask for the password) and is CASH ONLY.  Parking can be a bit of a nightmare, since it's located in First Markham Place."}
{"text":"Good dessert, good environment for family and friends gathering! Love the newly decorated place! And you can tell the owner put in a lot of effort bringing a lovely experience to relax for their customers!!!"}
{"text":"I got fooled into trying this place because I try all Taiwanese restaurants in the GTA, searching for the taste of back home.  This place is as bad as Pa Pa Chang, except it has better interior and not as crowded.  Food was just average, trying to be Taiwanese but failed.  If you go in there for just a meal, it's average in taste, but if you go in there thinking that you are going to get authentic Taiwanese food, then don't bother.  I give it a 4 out of 10."}
{"text":"There were not too many people on a Wednesday night. The server was really sweet and nice.  We ordered the honey brick toast and the sundae  The honey brick toast is huge. One portion can feed two people. The sundae was pretty much a smaller version of the honey brick toast. Pretty good"}
{"text":"A little disappointed. Although the taste overall is quite authentic, we found the food not meeting our expectations.  1. Beef noodle soup: good. The portion of noodles is too big, making the beef look little  2. Appetizers are all in very small plates, making u crave for more  3. Popcorn chicken lacks the heavy taste of white pepper and basil leaves that we have in Taiwan  4. The service is just ok"}
{"text":"Eight Treasure Tea ($5.49) really made me felt so much better especially on a rainy afternoon. The seating at the back with the cushions and electric outlets made me feel like I am at home....   It would have been better if not for the 2 men doing a study session right next to me.... blah blah blah... but it was nothing to do with Lohas Cafe.  Prices for food here are reasonable and before 8:30 pm, for extra $2 you can get a drink too.  Maybe I need to order some food next time....... deep fried popcorn chicken smell so good... I tried not to stare at people eating............"}
{"text":"Popcorn chicken was not bad... but by god the service is terribly slow.   There was only 3 tables of 2 ... it took over 25 mins to bring out my food.  during this time no drink was served..  we saw other tables wait equally long.  By the time i was half done my meal, my friends noodle finally came out.  The porkchop noodle was not good.  Porkchop tasted off...and the noodles have no taste at all.    other than the popcorn chicken i wouldnt recommend anything else.  the person took over 6 litteral minutes to make 1 bubble tea from powder.  HOW?  litterally 2 full songs went by and the guy was still making the same drink.    they had 4 people and virtually empty place.  theres no excuse."}
{"text":"Before you read on, this is a combination of two visits.   Second return to this place was pleasant. I finally got the honey brick toast that wasn't available the first time I was here. It was a bit heavy than expected and even though we had three people, we still were unable to finish it. Might be because we ordered the popcorn chicken too. In terms of taste for the brick toast, you're better off getting the smaller brick toasts of various creams. Wasn't anything eye popping nor was it amazing on your tastebuds.   Popcorn chicken is like your typical popcorn chicken. Nothing amazing, but it wasn't bad either.   Matcha milk tea was good though, but for the price I could prob get it elsewhere.   I came here again after a few months and I have to say I'm disappointed with the quality of the matcha brick toast. It's not as soft and flavourful as I remembered. Matcha milk tea doesn't seem as good either. Overall not impressed with this time's food, but owner was nice as usual. Waiter didn't talk much."}
{"text":"Had a \"work from home\" day but didn't want to stay home. Here's what I needed: - WiFi - an outlet - tea, coffee, AND FOOD - accept cards, preferably credit  And in Markham, don't get me wrong.. lots of places are cash/debit only. Or cash only under a certain amount. A little frustrating.. Fortunately Lohas Cafe takes credit (first question I asked when I entered!)  There were two people working here at 12 to 4pm when I was there. It was practically empty during this fine, rainy Wednesday. There were no more than 1 other table having lunch.  I found the only outlet by the window (actually I don't quite remember if there were more), ordered a peach tea and chicken curry, and started my work asap.  The peach tea came. A sticky peach tea... but wowwww it was delicious. It's pleasantly sweet and not sugary/gross sweet. I wish I knew where they buy this!   The curry was not spicy... not at all. That's okay because it was still really really good curry. In fact, I would say it's a sweet curry. I liked it a lot. I DRANK the curry and still had rice leftover.. it was goooddd!   I paid about $13 (with tips and tax). I believe they have lunch specials, so a free drink if you order certain dishes.  Anyways, the service was great. The guy who served me (young pimple face, lol) was very very nice. And very attentive. Also he did not bother me AT ALL as I was busy with work on my laptop (thank you!!!)  The WiFi needs a password but it's fast and perfect for my day."}
