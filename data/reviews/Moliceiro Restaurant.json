{"text":"I checked this place out on it's opening night. Its got  cool decor and very friendly staff. I was able to sample many menu items. Delicious. I don' t eat meat but it had lots of options for me. I had some amazing seafood, but the potatoes were on another level. I love potatoes, so trust me these are delicious. The brunch menu looked mouth watering; stuff I really want to try. Great drinks too. Mmmmmmm. My next visit will be for brunch."}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday for brunch. It was amazing!! I highly recommend this place. So many great things going for this restaurant...

It's located in a great area (you can eat here and then go for a walk through nearby Trinity Bellwoods park). The restaurant itself looks awesome. I really liked the decor and appreciated the details put into the design. The menu had a lot of really great brunch options. I went with the Canadian Cheese Omelette and my boyfriend had the Cod Cakes Benny. Both were fantastic!!! Food was very tasty and had generous portions. The staff there were also wonderful. The waitress was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. The manager was also super friendly and checked in with us to see if we needed anything. I visit this area often and will definitely be back again to try their dinner (and of course come back for brunch!)."}
{"text":"This restaurant is somewhat of a hidden gem among the many restaurants on Ossington. The service is friendly and very welcoming. i had the octopus and it was amazing. It was grilled to perfection and very tender. It also came with rapini and potatoes which were also flavourful without being overpowering. The grilled salmon is also very appetizing. I also love the olives that come with the bread -they are what real olives should taste like. Definitely worth another visit."}
{"text":"I have been here  numerous times and for some very simple reasons, food is great, service is great and they always have something new to try. 
They have been able to host me for my date nights, birthday parties of 20+ people and quick business meetings - never an issue and everyone that I go with becomes a repeat customer. 
I recommend this place for anyone that has never experienced higher end Portuguese food. Fantastic dishes and great service. Big fan."}
{"text":"Awesome new restaurant for dinner. Great fresh food, service and friendly owner. We ordered the calamari to start and this arrived just before the complimentary olives and fresh bread. Btw everything is home made. All the sauces and dips.  Everything is authentic and original. We had shrimp and their famous francisinha as our mains. Delicious. We were stuffed but had to try the homemade chocolate mousse cheese cake. Yum!!!!!"}
{"text":"We took some visiting friends with whom our last memories were sharing amazing Portuguese food in the old Portuguese colony of Macau.  Our hopes were that we could relive that experience and Moliceiro did not disappoint.  The host and owner Frank was a delight as he advised on wines and a series of food plates to share.  The series of plates with shrimp, Portuguese sausages, chicken, beef and octopus were each a delight and the olives we ate throughout were fantastic.  Our hope is that this 6 month old establishment becomes very successful as it is brings a great addition to the diverse food scene of cultural tastes from around the globe that exists in Toronto."}
{"text":"Best Portuguese restaurant in little Portugal for quality and the value.  I went in and got a francesinha and it was perfect.  The fries were even done in the Portuguese way.  The chocolate mousse was also spot on,  you need to try this mousse.  They bring in Belgian chocolate for the mouse and it is exactly how it is in Portugal.  They know how to do mousse.  Friendly staff and great wonder who cares about his product, check it out."}
{"text":"We came in because another place we wanted to go to had a long line up.  We were glad we came here and the food definitely did not disappoint.  The portions were just right and the service was top notch.  We started with the calamari and grilled sausages.  They were delicious.  The calarmi were big.  They had two types of sausages on the plate which included a hybrid blood sausage.  It was quite tasty.  For the mains we had shrimp pasta and steaks.  I was surprised to see egg on top of most of the steak choices.  It was interesting but I really wanted to try it.  It egg and sirloin was a great combo which also came with fries.   I definitely recommend.  It was a nice little place with a lot of good food."}
{"text":"Excellent Portuguese cuisine, pleasant setting, super friendly staff..  a gem on Ossington"}
{"text":"So that was a nice random pleasant surprise. I'm not sure what I was doing on Yelp when this restaurant showed up. Husband and I are almost always down some Portuguese food since there's always enough grilled meats and fish options. We've been to another few spots before but flavour wise I enjoyed this the best.
For starters we got the grilled calamari and  cod cakes which i found light fluffy and delicious. Husband found a few bones in his though. The calamari was unique served with black eyed beans and onions and pretty large portion size. 
For mains  we shared soft succulent lamb chops and a very unique pasta with Chipotle sauce and chicken. Can't say I've ever seen that anywhere before and it was tempting enough for me to break my low carb diet rule. Well worth it! Though we weren't initially going to order dessert cuz the portion size were so generous for mains but I'm so glad we decided to get the tiramisu !! Delicious. Topped the great meal with an espresso and voila! 

Will be back someday to try their other dishes. The owner came out to check on tables which was really nice. Great people good food . Try it out folks!"}
{"text":"Great food.   All made from scratch in house.  From the outstanding olives served with bread to the most amazing chocolate cheescake/mouse dessert.  I also had the Portuguese sandwich.  Too much meat. (Lol no such thing as too much)   Probably a signature dish.

Met the owner Frank.  Great guy.  Service was great.  He even make the bitters (for the cocktails) in house.  Hint ask for a beer martini.  Not on the menu but great. (Sweet vermouth with a Portuguese beer).

5 Stars will be back."}
{"text":"The name means a traditional sort of Portuguese riverboat. It is a reflection of the atmosphere and food that is found in this restaurant. (A little out of place with the chi-chi other restaurants surrounding it, but actually probably more worthwhile!)

The wine list is inexpensive, full of interesting Portuguese wines that one would otherwise not normally sample. (If you want to bring your own there is a $15 corkage). We had an Allo Albarino which was delicious, minerally and fresh, rather like a rich Vino Verde.
We were given some fat thick olives and some good bread which was cold but otherwise fine.
Our octopus was hot, great, on a bed of pickled onion, very soft and tender, and plenty of it. \"It is one of the signature dishes of the restaurant\".
The Greek salad was standard, lots of crisp lettuce but rather light on the other ingredients.
Our sea bream was on a bed of garlic and beautifully cooked but not deboned ; plenty enough to share for two. Very worthwhile.
Our lamb chops were also great, grilled well, with still the stripes of the grill on the flesh, mushrooms and bacon accompanying them, lovely.
French fries crisp and hot.
Service very attentive, informative and interesting.

Overall, an underestimated little gem in this hothouse restaurant area."}
{"text":"The host and owner Frank was VERY friendly and knowledgeable and gave great recommendations. He was also very helpful about the wine. Plus he allowed us to sample two wines before we made a choice. Great customer service and smart marketing. This is the only restaurant I've been to that has reasonably priced bottles of wine. I never understood why others charge $70 or $80 for a bottle that costs $15 at the LCBO. They even offer a smaller bottle for individual diners. Also, a smart idea! As for the food, it was all great. We had two great appetizers, mains and desserts. We were stuffed! You get you money's worth and more!! Truly a hidden gem among the pretentious and over priced restaurants on Ossington. It was a great anniversary experience."}
{"text":"My date and I wandered in on a busy Saturday night and luckily scored seats at the bar. We were greeted by the owner Frank. The ambience was beautiful and a large group was dining to celebrate an engagement, but we still felt attended to and it was still a perfect intimate dining space. We ordered a house wine with Frank's help, along with the shrimp and crostini appetizer. We enjoyed every bite. The olives and bread were so fresh. The francesinha and grilled octopus mains were out of this world!! Some of the best octopus I've had - so tender - and I've eaten it in fresh on the Mediterranean. We were blown away by the quality and care put into the dishes. For dessert we had tiramisu and passion fruit mousse - they also did not disappoint. I'm not normally a dessert person but they were amazing and perfectly balanced the meal. We will be back. This is a fantastic date spot or place for large groups or events."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Thursday evening, no wait and were seated right away. Ordered their signature octopus dish and seabass dish. Food tasted great. Fish was perfectly grilled and octopus was tender and not chewy. I deducted one star for the service provided by the waiters. Although it was a slow evening (3-4 tables occupied) the servers completely forgot about our table and water cups were never filled until the very end when we were making payment. Staffs need to be more attentive to customers."}
{"text":"Service was NOT good. The waiter had no idea what was going on. He asked us if we wanted desert as our entrees were approaching the table. Very basic food. My fish was rubbery and bland. His octopus was even more rubbery and even more bland. Don't waste your money here. Also...HUGE bones in my filet of fish. Waiter said it should be like that. They did offer us free desert but we were turned off."}
{"text":"A very casual dining experience. No need to feel pressured into dressing up. More importantly, you're no going to be in and out. Fortunately the ambiance is conducive for a long stay with friendly staff to make you're dining experience enjoyable. 

Their food is okay. Priced accordingly, so it was a pleasant surprise to have a good meal and not to feel the pain in the bank book."}
{"text":"Great food and service! The tiger prawn salad is one of the best I've had in a while, and the coconut mousse dessert was excellent!"}
{"text":"Ordered Salmao Fresco e Basil for takeout today. For the price tag of $16 (without tax), it was definitely not worth it. Overall, the pasta was bland, almost tasted like canned rosé pasta, and there wasn't that much salmon in it. They should step up their game to compete with other decent restaurants on Ossington."}
{"text":"Came for Lunch. The clams were amazing as was the wine Luan recommended. Great service, great ambiance, amazing food!"}
{"text":"Sloppy food. Sloppy service. Tuesday night. Ordered lamb chops. Asked medium rare. Was rare. I don't mind. More important it was tough you couldn't cut into it. Ordered cod grilled. Overly salted (dish sometimes carries that though). We asked for substitution and to have rapini on the side; we were asked 6 bucks for the change. So sad. Staff undertrained. Kitchen low level. Will not see us again."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed our experience in this pretty authentic Portuguese place. We had the Portuguese sausages as an appetizer, which had a tasty sauce. For our mains, we got the Francesinha (artery-clogging meat/cheese/gravy sandwich oozing with goodness) and the house specialty which was the grilled octopus (a tad salty but definitely tasty). For dessert we got the coconut creme and passion fruit mousse - both were a nice balance to end the meal. Definitely recommend of you want to try out Portuguese cuisine.

PS: I can see why everyone is raving about the olives - they tasted really fresh!"}
{"text":"Whenever I find myself hungry in an unfamiliar neighbourhood, I turn to Yelp for suggestions. When in Little Portugal, Portuguese food seems like the obvious choice. With 4.5 stars, Moliceiro certainly caught my attention and it was literally only 140m around the corner. We walked past a few interesting looking and very busy places on our way there. There was only one other diner but we decided to give it a try anyway.

To start, we ordered Cod Fish Cakes (Bacalhau) and Chorizo sausages. The fish cakes were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. A splash of lemon and a little aioli dip - delicious!

The sausages were flambéed at the table, unexpected but very nice. There were two types of sausages, one made with blood and the other with pork. I'm not fond of blood sausages but my companion was happy to devour it. I loved the other one. There was a nice tomato sauce with it.

I don't usually eat a lot of bread but we were served a freshly made locally sourced loaf that was so good, we had to ask for another one! We were so engaged in eating this delicious food, we forgot to order our entrées!

My companion, a lifelong friend visiting from Vancouver, chose the grilled squid and I chose the braised short rib. Although a few more diners had arrived, the kitchen still wasn't very busy and it didn't take long for our food to arrive.

Wow! Very nice presentation on the entrées and very generous portions. Lots of colour on the plates. Everything looked so good!

I tried the squid and it was very tasty and tender. The beef was cooked to perfection, tender, flavourful, and came off the bone very easily. Both dishes were delicious!

It's worth mentioning that the veggies were also perfectly cooked and the selection was very nice - broccoli, carrots, asparagus, potatoes, and green beans.

With everything being so good so far, we decided to share an order of custard for dessert. It was creamy smooth, not too sweet. Perfect! I've used that word a lot in this review and it's well deserved.

The service was also outstanding! Our server explained each dish and offered some suggestions. The owner came over and chatted with us a few times. Nice personal touch.

If you're in the mood for good authentic Portuguese food, not the grilled chicken that's served at fast food joints or chain restaurants, find your way to Moliceiro. You won't be disappointed.

PS - My companion was so impressed by this food, he made his way across town via public transit to have lunch there today. I have no doubt he'll go back again before returning home. He better invite me to join him!

PPS - Yelp almost got it right. It's 5 stars, not 4.5!"}
{"text":"Great service and my meal was perfectly cooked. Highly recommend checking this great Portuguese restaurant."}
{"text":"I was looking around for a place in town that offers a great FRANCESINHA (Famous portuguese hot sandwich with angus steak & smoked ham, topped with havarti cheese, house gravy & a fried egg served with house cut fries). I haven't had one since I travelled through Portugal a couple of years ago and was first introduced to the dish. I was hoping to experience it all over again and Moliceiro did not disappoint. It was everything I remembered for my travels abroad. If you haven't had one of these 'sandwiches', it's high time! :)

Disclaimer: This meal is incredibly rich, heavy & filling. I would recommend splitting it between two people... That way, you can take advantage of other items on the menu.

We also order the ROBALO GRELHADO C/ MOLHO VERDE (Grilled sea bass served with salt crusted roast potatoes & sautéed rapini) & the ANANÁS GRELHADO C/ VINHO DE PORTO (Grilled pineapple with Port wine) and both were pretty good..."}
{"text":"I usually don't like restaurants that leave me thinking \"that was a good home cooked meal\" because, I mean, why go out if that's what you're just getting right? Moliceiro though is one of the stand-out exceptions. The home-cooked vibe their food gives off doesn't detract from the experience but actually brings it up a level. My wife and I have come here a number of times and we consistently leave with full and warm tummies. 

Let me explain by starting at the place no one ever really pays attention to: The complementary stuff to tide you over as you wait for your meal. Moliceiro gives you bread (standard tasting) but pairs it with the best olives in the city. I know other reviewers have made this observation in the past, and it still sounds silly to me writing this, but Moliceiro's olives are absolutely flat-out outstanding. When we ask the owner where he gets it, he smiles and says \"Well my mom makes them for me.\" Restaurant-as-home-cooked-meal at its apex.

The actual meal itself was great. We usually get the octopus (their signature dish, and rightfully so with great flavouring and good cook so it isn't tough to eat), but this time tried to change it up a bit. We got:

- Lagosta Acafrao (new offering): Lobster pasta with a tomato-based sauce. The first few swirls, I thought it was a tad on the bland side, but then after a few bites, the tomato+cilantro+almonds flavours really kicked in. The lobster was plump and tender, and the pasta noodles were a perfect aldente. Really hope Moliceiro continues offering this because it was a stand-out dish like it's octopus.
- Lulas: Grilled squid with Spanish sauce. This was just ok, as the squid was a bit tough to cut through (though definitely tasted fresh), the veggies were standard, and the sauce wasn't bad but wasn't great. We actually ended up dipping the squid into the sauce from the Lagosta Acafrao because that was so good.
- Pave (traditional Brazilian dessert): I've never had pave before and it was interesting. Kinda like a tiramisu but none of the coffee/liquor taste. This was just (dainty) mounds of biscuits, chocolate and cream - yum!
- Coconut cream mousse: This dessert is one of our favourites, not just at Moliceiro but at any restaurant. It's not overly sweet, the coconut flavour really comes through without being overpowering, and the cream is light and fluffy. It's so good we asked if we could order some to bring home! While not a typical request they get, the owner put it in a makeshift container and we carried it away.

So yes, Moliceiro does give off a home-cooked-meal vibe. But it's one that leaves you skipping happily away, and planning your next visit back."}
{"text":"I visited Moliceiro with a few friends a couple months ago - largely because I had a hankering for Portuguese food, of which my knowledge is scarce at best. 

Though the food here is certainly better than many, and priced well, I finished the evening slightly underwhelmed with the entire experience.

See, it wasn't about the portions: I was positively stuffed after my meal. Nor was it the service: solid, which is as good as you'd hope for this restaurant. 

My reservations are limited to the food - reasonable, but far from great. I ordered a pasta dish... Toronto has some absolutely fantastic spots for pasta - so perhaps it was my own fault for ordering a dish that is not one of Moliceiro's signatures. 

I'd hope for Moliceiro to focus on dishes that they can specialize in. But with that said - I can understand the struggle for a restaurant, particularly for one located on the Ossington strip, where its clientele is far from a niche audience that understands Portuguese food (look at me!). 

From what I can see, many of their dishes seem to have captured the taste buds of many a Yelper.

I'm open to another visit. I'd love to change my mind on this one - and next time, will likely order the octopus!"}
{"text":"I will rant and rave about this place.  From the stylish interior to the delicious food this place could easily become a go to that won't break the bank!"}
{"text":"Missing Portugal, I decided to check this place out for a \"faux vacay\".  Interior is nice, clean, and modern!  I love the exposed red brick, gray walls, and terracotta pitchers.

I arrived in the middle of the afternoon, so there were only 2 other tables occupied.

We ordered Grilled Chicken ($17), Francesinha ($22, hot sandwich that looks like a Portuguese lasagna), & a glass of rosé ($7).  Price seemed to correspond to portion as the Grilled Chicken was completely finished while I ate only half of my sandwich.

I was not able to try the sandwich when I was in Porto, or even Lisbon, so I do not have anything to compare it to.  However, the sandwich was not heat thoroughly.  When I cut into it, it was barely warm, not hot.  Although it was tasty, the gravy was a bit too salty.  Steak on the inside was dry.  Again, it tasted fine, but there were things I noticed.  Fries, although tasty, weren't crispy.  So sandwich is like a 3/5.

Grilled Chicken smelled good, but I did not taste it.

Younger male server, who I later found out was the owner was very warm and friendly!  Just like the atmosphere.

Verdict:  I'd definitely be open to going back to try other things, like Pulvo, on the menu.  And maybe order the Niepoort White Port that is not available at the LCBO.  :(  Boo!"}
{"text":"Authentic Portuguese food and drinks with an updated presentation. Healthy options are available, especially in the appetizers and fish and seafood sections of the menu. The space is classy but not pretentious. I have been to Portugal and this place is the real deal. Bom apetite!"}
{"text":"Despite being a smallish resto and not particularly attractive inside Moliceiro would justify frequent visits if we lived in the neighbourhood.
We don't but it will still be top of mind should we end up in Trinity Bellwoods again."}
{"text":"Staff is amazing and friendly, if you're in town and want a taste of Portugal this is definitely a spot to check out! We had the francesinha,sea bass, pork chop, octopus and clams! Now this New Yorker is off to exploring this city xox cheers"}
{"text":"My friend Chris and I decided to explore the district of Little Portugal.   I was visiting from Coquitlam, British Columbia and  had never been to this area or sampled authentic Portuguese home style cooking.  We lucked out as the food was absolutely wonderful.   The owner was very attentive and noticed us playing with the menu n dishes and came to greet us.  He explained that he graduated from university and had decided to continue the family restaurant.  He took it over and decided to take the menu right back to its original style of basic Portuguese recepie  home style cooking.   I found that every bite told a story from each dish.The visuals of the plate along with the colours of the food were in so many words.....captivating.  But it was the flavours of each dish that danced in your mouth that simply took my breath away.  For the level of quality of this food and the obvious love and care put into each dish.......you just can't lose with at least experiencing a wonderful slice of Portuguese culinary history with a family that has put so much pride in each dish."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Portuguese restaurant before. My best friend is Portuguese so she makes lots of yummy food for me that I don't have to go out to eat. My aunts craved for Portuguese food so I used Yelp to assist me.  We decided on Moliceiro located in Ossington where all the amazing restaurants are located.  Yelp gave it a great rating so we decided to try it.  There's paid meter parking outside of the restaurant.  It was freezing and luckily I got a spot right in front of the restaurant.  It's wasn't packed on a Saturday night initially.  I was thinking it was because of the cold. But an hour later the place was packed. The restaurant is not too big.  We ordered their house Portuguese red wine, amazing wine. For the appetizer we ordered the clams with white wine garlic sauce.  That seems to be quite popular since throughout the night a majority of the tables ordered that appetizer. It was so good. We also got the Portuguese sausages in tomato sauce.  We  had some fresh bread and olives to start.  Since we ordered so many appetizers and the server told us the portions are large we settled on 2 main entrees to share between 3 of us. We got the octopus which is to die for. So good. Also got the jumbo shrimps with olive oil and peri peri sauce and fettuccine. It's a bit on the spicy side but we loved it. We were planning to get 2 desserts to share but they were out of tiramisu so we got the flan custard.  Amazing.  All in all a great meal.  The service was great. Our server made some great recommendations.  Will definitely come back and highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The server is really nice and helpful. He agreed to make us cocktails even tho it's not on the menu and it was good. 

The foods are just okay, taste fine. Not even that great. A bit overpriced for the flavour. They have really good bread and olives given for free. I usually don't like olives but their olives are so subtly good. 
We ordered one of the tomato salads it was just okay, not too flavourful. 
I ordered the Francesinha because I read the reviews saying I should try it. It was just salty. Ham + cheese + gravy = salty! It comes with a side of chips, which is also too salty. 
Perhaps I just ordered the wrong food"}
{"text":"Had the salad with shrimp and my husband had chicken. Very good and homey meals :) we enjoyed the wine, bread and butter also.
Only feedback would be that the appetizer olives were quite salty! But I love that they were mixed with onion and peppers :)"}
{"text":"The Ossington strip has a lot of delicious places, but most of them are a little pretentious, gimmicky and don't quite live up to the hype. My husband and I were both incredibly pleasantly surprised by Moliceiro. 

We started with the house white wine, a beer with a shot of martini rosso (apparently a bar staple in Portugal) and the clams. The garlic butter surrounding the clams is a life taker. So delicious, I ate about five slices of bread before our mains. Needless to say I couldn't finish my lamb chops... but I had fun trying."}
