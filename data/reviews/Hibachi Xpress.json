{"text":"if you like your steak overcooked and dried out this is your place !  if you like the cook to argue with you and tell you - you don't know what is medium rare this is your place!  probably the nastiest cook I've ever met."}
{"text":"Hibachi part gets 5 stars, Xpress parts gets 2- took 30+ minutes to get lunch and had to take it back to work cause I didn't have time to eat. Looked like the person on the grill was doing one order at a time. There were 5+ people waiting. Food was great and has huge portions but they are still having some growing pains. I will be back for sure, just may need to order early or when I have more time"}
{"text":"This was my 1st time here, the employee at the cancer is your was nice but she informed me if I was going to order I would have to wait 40 minutes for rice ? Really, ok they said they can deliver which will cost me extra. But  I felt I shouldn't have to pay because it was in my Fault  they were out of rice but OK I wanted to try something new, the portions are big but I got the steak which would we way overcooked and was very tough it was ok flavor , good luck, the rice was good,"}
{"text":"When I think of Hibachi, I think of Benihana. A five course meal with onion soup, salad, veggies,shrimp appetizer, and your entree.  Hibachi Xpress is a condensed version. You're only getting veggies, and your entree. Nonetheless, although very different than Benihana in taste, it wasn't that bad. I ordered the double seafood with shrimp and scallops. My husband had shrimp and chicken. His entree looked sooooo good. Mainly because the scallops in my entree were tiny and looked a bit weird. I wasn't expecting that. Nothing was wrong with the taste, it tasted very good, it just looked different.  The meals come with a side of yum yum sauce which was a creamy sweet sauce you would pour over your meal. It was ok, but I love the ginger sauce instead.  Our orders were cooked fresh and made on a grill you can see from the tables. Definitely a great option for quick hibachi meals."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but that's about it.  The location is small, and not properly ventilated.  The grease from the grill just permeates the air.  The portions were good, and the price was ok. We all have our bad days, perhaps this was just one of them."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for lunch. The steak, vegetables rice and sauce.  The steak was so well done and dry it could not be eaten.  There was 4 small pieces of broccoli some carrots and 1 mushroom.  Nothing was seasoned and the ginger sauce was so sweet I thought I was eating sugar.  I will never eat here again and I will make sure my coworkers know about the food."}
{"text":"It's like well-seasoned mush.   The seafood and veggies were cooked well, no complaints. As for the noodles...I've had better at the mall. I would suggest not cooking them to mush with a ton of sauce. It just ruins the entree. With a few tweaks, this place could be better."}
{"text":"Ok as long as you can cook rice and properly season the protein thats the start but to seal the deal you need a superb hibachi sauce and yum yum sauce. Sorry but this place didn't come through both sauces were almost mediocre. The best hibachi is about 2 exits off of 77 S."}
{"text":"Used to order from this place often. My son ate 3 bites of shrimp and started throwing up! Ordered today because I'm hurt and unable to drive. They didn't bring half our dinner so 1 kid had something they didn't order and the other was going to have my dinner. When I called the rude husband and wife running the place could have cared less that they again left half of us without dinner. Now I get to figure out dinner a second time today and have a barfing kid. My credit card was charged the full amount even though half of our dinner was not received. I ordered the double entree with both meats shrimp so they also said they had to charge me an extra $2. All that was eaten was thrown up! What a waste of $36! She told me to have fun cooking dinner!!"}
