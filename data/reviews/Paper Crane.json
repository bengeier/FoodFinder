{"text":"Best sushi ever amazing service and quick at getting us our food nice and quite cozy place with happy faces"}
{"text":"I disagree with the good reviews - the place smells like bad fish, the floors and cutlery are dirty and the staff is rude. Went in once, was put off by the rude staff and the smell. Won't go back. Gross!"}
{"text":"If you want fresh and delicious sushi, this is the place to be! The decor is nice and the atmosphere is very intimate. Service is always great and super friendly. The owner Gin is AMAZING! She remembers your name and truly cares about her customers. The food is delicious and high quality! It puts those all you can eat places to shame. Their Paper Crane roll is out of this world! Highly recommend this place for any occasion!!!"}
{"text":"Office staff took me for my bday here.  My first time and didnt disappoint.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Top notch, fresh sushi with wonderful service and beer on the menu from the local micro brewery."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch 
Ordered combination bento sushi,sashimi and maki
Ordered also an eal roll (Unagi) which was excellent 
Miso soup was very tasty - well above your average miso soup 
All sashimi and sushi were very fresh 
The Solomon and tuna sashimi were served chilled as you would expect
Good food - nice place

Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Lovely management and fresh food. 10/10

Samantha's comment is invalid as all of her other reviews are bashing."}
{"text":"We stopped in here today for a late lunch. We weren't even sure if it was open but we thought we would check it out to make sure. We are so glad we did!

We started off with some appetizers: Gyoza dumplings, Vegetable Tempura, Chicken Katsu, and Don Katsu (pork). The apps were great and I especially loved the vegetable tempura, such a great flavour, a good crunch, and you could taste the freshness of the vegetables.  The Katsu is similar to a schnitzel and the dumplings had a great crunch on the outside with a tender and tasty filling. 

We then ordered the California Roll Tempura and the Sexy Spicy Roll - each serving was 8 pieces.  I loved the tempura roll, and not just because I'm a sucker for just about anything deep fried! ;)  the Sexy Spicy Roll was fantastic as well. 

After all that food I barely had room for dessert but the kids wanted a slice of cheesecake. We opted for the chocolate cheesecake which has a rich ganache over a thick and creamy cheesecake with chocolate chips in it and a chocolate graham crust. It was easily one of the best slices of cheesecake I've had!  It wasn't too sweet and had the right balance of richness. The filling almost had a hint of amoretto in it and the chocolate chips were added a nice texture. 

It's not hard to tell that they use fresh ingredients and put love and care into their preparation. The restaurant is small, maybe about 30 seats including the bar and a small patio for about another 12 people or so. The service was friendly and welcoming. While they don't have delivery, they do have take out and I would not hesitate to drive up from Teston Road and Keele to take some home to eat!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service, great selection of sashimi, nigiri, sushi rolls and hand rolls, bento box and appetizers. Lunch special is available for a great price- bento box including rice + choice of main course + sushi + salad + glass noodles + soup for $10. 
Signature rolls are very delicious and come at a fair price."}
{"text":"I dislike fish but got a wild hair today and decided to drive out to have some sushi. To my surprise I loved it! Fresh ingredients with great flavour, nice relaxed clean atmosphere with great service. I would recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"Walking in small place but nice aroma/atmosphere. Eating the food there was kind of disappointing since I ordered the sushi A and I thought since it was mainly sushi on the platter the dish should be really explosive. Personally the rice underneath was really disappointing, I felt the rice and it felt like the bottom of my shoe and I felt like i was eating yesterday's rice. Other wise the aroma and the waitress was nice. 

P. S the salad looked and tasted like it was out of the fridge and miso soup was not warm enough for me"}
{"text":"I'm used to eating at all you can eat places where the quality dips and varies. This was fantastic and well worth the price. A dinner box is more then enough for one person and fairly priced. Might be the best sushi I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Amazing! This is a hidden gem. The restaurant is small and can get quite busy. Best to call ahead and make a reservation! The prices are a tad higher than other places but it is worth every nickel (penny)! Food was fresh and the salmon sashimi melted in your mouth. Service was good, food arrived fairly quickly."}
{"text":"The sushi was below average. Rice was so far from good - kinda hard, so dry. It's so expensive. We had a love boat and the bill came to 90 dollars. The food was so disappointing, how this restaurant has a 4.5 is so beyond me. Either we went on a very bad, off day, or the people who eat here have never had good sushi before. I went there based on the reviews and felt like I was ripped off. I was so angry. Still am. Don't waste your money here. Go next door and have a proper home made meal for half the price."}
{"text":"This is probably the best sushi place in the GTA. Never disappointed whether we eat in, or order take out! The service is amazing, and we are greeted every time we walk in the door. It's quality sushi, for a fair price. If you like sushi you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"Best sushi around! They have unique rolls and everything tastes so fresh. When you walk in they greet you with an enthusiastic hello! I love this place. It's my family's favorite King City restaurant. Also, the owner is so friendly and makes a point to let you know that she remembers you from the last time you were there. I love restaurants that make you feel they really appreciate your business. It's a King City All Star!"}
{"text":"Lovely, quiet place in King city, on a cozy street of restaurants. Loved the friendly service and tasty, well presented food. 
Prices are higher than most places, but the quality is excellent."}
{"text":"Walking in everyone who works there says welcome at the same time which is cute. 

Very very small place 

All tables crowded. 

The sushi was fresh for sure. But honesty it wasn't my favourite. Especially how EXPENSIVE it was. 

Very expensive. 

I wouldn't go back just because of the price but the sushi was ok nothing amazing I'd say , the avacado wasnt riped yet so it had a loud bite to it which also I don't like. 

My bf enjoyed it tho so that's good but honestly I wouldn't go back just because of the price. And the spicy sauce was different than others places which I wasn't a big fan."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in king city! I've had my fair share of sushi and this place is seriously one of the freshest and tastiest sushi restaurants I've ever had. The sashimi is creamy and melts in your mouth. Even the green tea is the best. If you find yourself in the area do yourself a favor and give this place to go!"}
{"text":"This lovely little sushi restaurant in King City is amazing! I stopped by today for a quick lunch and had an awesome time. The interior design is super cute and makes you feel like you're at home with the cushioned seats and soft pillows. And cranes are everywhere, which I thought looked really neat! The environment was quiet/relaxing and the staff was extremely nice and attentive.

The food was tasty and well-presented with fresh sashimi and rolls. Everything was prepared very nicely and quickly. Great quality! I had the Sashimi Dinner (16 pcs of sashimi) and the Dragon War (orange dragon roll, green dragon roll, 4 pcs of nigiri). They were both delicious - I would certainly recommend these items if you are looking for some variety in the familiar and generic stuff. However, if you want something a bit different, the menu has a wide selection between the rolls, sashimi, and sets. 

I definitely intend on coming back to try some of the more unique sushi rolls next time. I've got my eyes on the \"Paper Crane\" Roll, \"Sexy Spicy\" Roll, and the \"You Know? Hot?\" Roll. I am a sucker for sushi rolls with funny names!"}
{"text":"Sushi in King City? finally

its seems forever that King City did not support the japanese lifestyle but then again its not that big of a city to worry about

In downtown King at the corner a great place has opened up

congrats to the owner for taking a chance at a resto here

I gotta say that these people have PUT THEIR HEART AND SOUL into this palce and it shows

The treat you like a king when you come, offer great service and really are happy you are there. This is how it works in Japan where customers are really and truly treated as guests

The Bento Bax (they miss spelled it) is standard fare and quite good for lunch and looking at their dinner menu it looks good too

I love how the space is kind o f chic modern with a downtown look that may not be expected in farm country but its wonderful and would make a great first date place

hey bring the family and tuck into the massive rolls platter for dinner

being a japanese food bigot I will always have the unagi (eel) and will enjoy a one coin 500 yen ramen bowl (not here in canada i must say..more like a ten loonie bowl) but these guys have freshness figured out

now just to set the story straight in that many sushi places may not serve authentic fish...i can say they did offer up a real maguro (Tuna) and Hokigai (surf clam) and it was fresh so they did pass my bullshit meter test.......

enjoy...come with friends...drink up the Sapporo...and as you walk to the car (no parking fees involved) and rub your belly   remind yourself...this is a gift for the King City citizens.....campai

soon jennifer k will review"}
{"text":"Finally we have a sushi place in King City!!
Such a small town that is seriously lacking in the culinary department.
The staff and the service here are top notch.  Friendly and attentive.
The sushi is quite good too.  You're standard fare with fresh ingredients.
The atmosphere is modern, and elegant.
Definitely check it out"}
{"text":"By far my favourite sushi place in the GTA. Seriously amazing service, food is always fresh and DELICIOUS. Overall, this is the best sushi I've ever had with reasonable prices. Definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I usually judge my sushi restaurants based on their spicy salmon rolls. The spicy salmon & tuna rolls here are awesome. The fish is very fresh."}
{"text":"I really really like the Paper Crane.  

Many people have already commented on atmosphere, food, and service.  I'd like to comment on how they received my very misbehaving children and me having a grump session with my husband.  They were exquisite - they were thoughtful and kind.  When my son knocked over the soy sauce there was a server at hand with a cloth who reassured me that it was ok.  Although my kids were playing with the mini porcelain cranes, the staff did not blink an eye.  They were 100% attentive to our needs.  I was extremely grateful.

As for the food - it's delicious. I've been back twice so far.  I really like that they're trying to give you an authentic independent experience vs the usual sushi chains.  You're coming here because you want to eat off Keele St. in the small village that is King City and the pleasant architecture of yesteryear.  You don't come here for all-you-can-eat."}
{"text":"Made last min reservations.. Happy i did as the restaurant was filled up before i arrived..

Quaint lil restaurant wit friendly staff..
Wife and i ordered a love boat for two.. Boat consisted of a Combination of rolls plus nigiri...
I appreciated the variety and freshness of the fish..
Meal came with miso and salad..
Miso was pretty standard.. 
Salad was very fresh and i appreciate how the dressing came on the side..

Took off one star because the rice on the nigiri was a lil under seasoned... Also the rice was also not compacted/pressed well enough.. The odd piece would fall apart a bit before makin it to my mouth..

I plan to come back perhaps for takeout and try out more of their rolls..."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi! The people are always so nice in person and on the phone. Really cute restaurant to sit down in! Overall a great place"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here! The gin roll is to die for as everything is made to order there. We usually get the massa dinner conbo as it's 25 pieces and you can mix and match if you don't like the selected rolls. It's bomb give it a try!"}
{"text":"Passed by for take-out on the recommendation of a friend. I've got no serious complaints about the sushi, it's just not my style. It's a little North American, and you lose the flavor of the fish behind the overuse of spicy mayo and other different sauces. I found even the rice was lacking the traditional vinegared flavor. It's the type of sushi that sits a little heavy. The quality and freshness is there, just lacks the authenticity I enjoy in good sushi."}
{"text":"Loved the food! Loved the service! Loved the ambiance! Had the kalbi ribs. Very tasty. Great presentation all around!!  Going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful meal with my family at the Paper Crane. It was our first time there and we enjoyed it thoroughly! The staff were very warm and friendly.  We enjoyed every dish! Have been to many Sushi restaurants before and this one was one of the best!"}
{"text":"Two words - Love Boat! Actually, make that 6 words - Love Boat and King City Roll. 

Ridiculously friendly service - everyone including the chefs greet you with a cheer when you enter, making you feel like a long-lost family member returning to the fold. 

Fantastic sushi, this was my first experience of a \"Love Boat\", which is (as you might expect) a boat-shaped wooden serving errr... boat (\"dish\" is too small a word!), laden with a selection of delicious sushi, sashimi etc. You can order various sizes depending on how large your party is.

The King City Roll is a house specialty of deep-fried salmon, cucumber, tobiko and avocado. Just one of several special rolls available - they all looked fantastic.

Washed down with some hot sake, this was an eating experience with good friends that I'll remember for quite some time."}
{"text":"Honestly one of my favourite sushi places to eat! Love the atmosphere, the food was amazing (although one piece of my beef was still raw, but it was an end piece so its all good for me) and the staff was super nice. They aren't all hovering around your table all the time, and tbh sometimes i wish they did a little bit because im shy and hate asking for more drinks lolz. Basically they served our food and then disappeared to the kitchen and I'm like oh ok. But other than that it was my first time visiting and I was pleasantly pleased. The bento box was very filling. The presentation was cute and the music was very modern oriental themed. Loved it!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places I've been go that doesn't serve AYCE. The staff is really friendly and just by the attention to detail in the decor (ceramic cranes resting your chops sticks at the table). Tuna tataki, fried calamari, miso soup, house salad and a variety of roles all came out quickly and made fresh. Living in Woodbridge it's a bit of a drive, but it's a nice change from being surrounded by average-to-good AYCE sushi restaurants. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"There's sushi and then there's SUSHI. This is SUUUUUSHI! Excellent quality, freshly hand crafted sushi. Warm welcome and good service. Price is fair for the quality. Will take a few visits to really understand the menu and discover your favourites. Nice ambience on weekends, cozy and cute little spot in a converted house."}
{"text":"I went to Paper Crane with a friend for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. There isn't that much parking in the area but since it is more of a quiet area, it was quite easy to find parking. My first impression when I walked into the restaurant was that it was not a big restaurant but it was cute. I sat down and realized that the chopsticks were on paper crane chopstick holders! I was already set on having high hopes for this restaurant when the décor was already that cute. 

Their lunch menu is until 3pm so my friend and I each ordered a sashimi lunch bento box and then ordered the paper crane roll. We were also given complimentary miso soup. The bento box came with salad, two pieces of sushi, fried tofu, 10 pieces of sashimi and some purple rice. The fish tasted very fresh and I really enjoyed the entire bento box. It was really unique to have purple rice instead of regular white rice. Although, I didn't think that the rice was really needed with the sashimi bento box. Maybe a sushi roll would have been a better fit with the bento box. 

The paper crane roll though. It was so good. It had lobster tail, avocado, and crab meat wrapped in soy bean paper. It was interesting to see a sushi roll that wasn't wrapped in seaweed. My friend and I really enjoyed it. 
Overall, I would come back to Paper Crane again for lunch to try some of their other special rolls and bento boxes!"}
{"text":"My family and I enjoyed a delicious meal at the Paper Crane last Friday night. It was dinner time so we had to wait a little bit as the restaurant was extremely busy with almost no seats available! However we decided to wait it out as a close friend of ours recommended this place. Much to our delight, the wait was very much worth it as the service and food were impeccable! Our family ordered the sushi boat and it must have been the freshest sushi I've ever eaten! We spoke to the waitress who we also found to be the owner, and she was quite the delight. Extremely friendly, and seemed to genuinely care about her customers. The restaurant is quite small with a touch of modern decor, and makes for an intimate night out with friends and family. Will definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"I made the long trek to King City and was glad! I really liked this place!!

Location:
In the wilds of King City.  Just kidding. It looks like it's located on their main street. Very cute.

Parking:
On street parking but it was a sunday evening so it wasn't so busy and didn't have to look anywhere else. I'm sure there's some cute little lot somewhere.

Decor:
Hmmm. how many times can I use the word cute in one review?  It's cute.  It's in one of those cute old houses that have a front porch.  We sat inside

Lots of tables and chairs. Tight but comfortable. Very welcoming and lots of origami birds!  :)

Food:
I got the Chicken Katsu. It was served with purple rice. Man, in Markham that stuff would be extra but Not in King  - It's posh here. I guess they expect purple rice ( not that I'm complaining it was cooked perfectly!!)  

I loved my dish.  Others at my table got sushi and they raved to. So yup.

Staff:
I'm not sure how much nicer or friendlier everyone could have been.  I'll be back solely because I need more people like that in my life!


So there weren't a lot of tables but man people were in and out all night. They do a HUGE amount of take out business.  it felt like I was at THE place to be in King City.  

For sure i'm going back. it was a fantastic evening! the food was great, loved the staff and it was so cute!!"}
