{"text":"\"Mattino\" is a forgettable name, sadly. This is the second time I've sat in that same corner, and each time it's not lived up to my expectations. 

The d√©cor is A-Ok, but nothing inspiring- The high chairs are on the cheap side. I had their mushroom risotto, not bad, but deserved a little truffle oil treatment. The gorgeous Man in pink did select the perfect wine, a beautiful Perez Cruz Cabernet... This is the reason for the 3-stars. 

Overall, it's a great place for drinks by the window, minus the eats."}
{"text":"Just read about Kody's departure from Mattino.   

What are the people at this restaurant thinking?   

Kody made this spot into the best environment on College street.  Now that he's apparently gone, I suspect that it will go the route of every other junky resto-bar that's been on this corner.

It's ironic, because I was just about to go onto Yelp and write a shining review about this spot... to inform the community about how spectacular the attention to detail and personal service was.    And I, like others before me, was looking forward to letting everyone know about Kody and his wonderful rapport with the customers and staff.   

We started hanging out here pretty heavily, almost entirely because of him and his mastery of the hospitality business.  Oh, it's probably worth letting you know that I have no prior connection to the guy whatsoever.

I'm beginning to think that the only reason that this bar exists is to schlock this horrid herbal supplement that the owner's inexplicably been trying to place on every table.

It's my birthday next week.   We had scheduled a 50 person party here which we're now going to be re-booking to another venue.  

Sometimes it's the PEOPLE who make the experience."}
{"text":"I was heartbroken to hear about Kody's departure from Mattino.  Like Daniel B., I'd had no prior contact with him, but he was close to 80% of the reason I had become a regular at Mattino and had recommended it to so many friends and colleagues.   

Granted, some strange things had begun to happen there.  We had gone for dinner during the Taste of Little Italy, and while we were eating, a young girl came around and delivered pamphlets to our otherwise romantic table about this strange fruit based energy drink.  I agree with Daniel that it seems they're confusing owning a restaurant with a test market for snake oil.  

You can't expect to be an overwhelming success in only a few weeks of being open for business.  I know it's hard for first time restaurateurs, but if you want to survive in Little Italy, every decision counts, and people notice the bad ones more.

*Quick update:  July 1st
I threw a party at Mattino for 30 or so people, against my better judgment.   One of our guests was sitting by me on the patio almost all night, and when he went in to cover his tab, he was informed that the owner had called his credit card company (and it was long before closing), assuming he was gone without ever having checked the busy patio.  The restaurant decided to eat the tab (but they sort of had to, because he had no other way of paying).  I was super embarassed that our friend had to endure that sort of treatment.  I don't think I'll be going back."}
