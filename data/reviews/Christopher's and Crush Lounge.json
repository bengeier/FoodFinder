{"text":"Was in town shopping with friends & decided to stop and have dinner at Christopher's. The entire experience was wonderful from beginning to end. Our waiter, Phil, was knowledgeable, friendly, adding to the wonderful dishes we enjoyed. Will definately come back on my next trip! Devine!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Christopher's last night with some friends and had a spectacular evening!! The service and food was outstanding!! I had the red bell pepper soup, infused filet and au gratin potatoes....and the French pear martini....So delicious. The GM stopped by our table to check on us which is always a nice touch. I would highly recommend this restaurant - it is a gem!!!!! Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"I tried several dishes with my friends. the number in [] is the star. Highest is 5. Soupe: Roasted red bell pepper soup: sweet, full-bodied, buttery(cream or cheese), savory [4].   Wild mushroom soup: full-bodied, oily, greasy, strong.  Too much for me. [3.5] Plat de résistance: Filet of salmon: crispy fried, salty, good fish. [3.5] Smoked Truffle-Infused Filet Mignon: can feel the truffle, but average taste. good decor. [3] Smoked salmon sandwich: I believed the bread and bacon are too crispy and tough, with a thicker source. Should only include veggie and fish, with light source to emphasize salmon taste. [3] Dessert: Chocolate mousse tower: well design, which its chef learnt from Julia Child. Taste smooth, sweet, crispy chocolate tower crust and rich source. [5] Gateau marjolaine: smooth, with iced mousse, combined with hazelnut, praline, and coffee flavor. [5]"}
{"text":"1st time we went we tried the 4 course meal @ $45 + $15 wine pairing a great meal and a great deal. So of course we went back to repeat the success, just to learn that now it was $65 + wine, not sure why that increase that and the choices were not that exciting. We ended up picking from the menu. I ordered the chicken my husband the steak. Steak was great sauce was cold. The side dish, risotto with vegetables was the best of it all. My chicken was extremely disappointing dry and nothing special for $26. Finally the server came around asking if everything was ok, my husband was done with his meal at that time and I informed her about the chicken. We ordered the mousse tower which was just ok, tasted like store bought mousse and not home made. We are not gong back."}
{"text":"\"trendy, good service and great food!\" - 4/5  J and I went there the first time for dinner with Berk, D and Joel last night. Christopher is tucked away at the corner of Biltmore Fashion Mall on Camelback.  After the party arrived, we had a round of drinks at its Crush Lounge. The bar/lounge is trendy with good wine selection! We were seated outside the patio for dinner. It was the best outdoor fine dining experience that I had had in a while (well.. summer just over!) Let's get down to the menu... D strongly recommended Christopher's sweetbread main course. Since we had always wanted to try out sweetbread, we immediately jumped to her recommendation! J ordered the sweetbread too. I had the rack of lamb. B got herself a very generous portion of seared scallops with some green. Joel ordered a plate of burger and fries. Man.. I have to say that Christopher's food is delicious! The lamb was a bit overcooked (I asked for medium-rare) but still had a tender and good taste. J and D's sweetbread was to die-for! Next time when I go back, I would just order the sweetbread (comes with a big bed of stir-fry cabbage) too. We finished our dinner with 2 desserts!   Overall, this restaurant is better than our expectations. We'd definitely go back soon for a great meal. Get the sweetbread! :)"}
{"text":"Great dining experience...great chef! Chef Vincent is one of the countries best. The escargot is a must and should be shared. The bread is made at the restaurant. He has a 15 year old \"starter\"..have your waiter explain. Great bread! The salads are a must and can be shared. We had the Hanger Steak and is one of his specialties. It's would be hard to find a steakhouse that serves a more tender cut of meat. The wine stressed will help you find an affordable match. Try it...you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"We have done happy hour midweek at least four different times recently. Each of those times we have been delighted by the food and atmosphere, and most of the time by the service. This time our teenage son wanted to take me out, his treat with hard earned summer job $$. We drove 45 minutes, arrived at 3 pm and it was pretty empty. A group finishing up in the main dining area, but no one in the bar, lounge or booths. We stood for a while waiting for someone to notice us.  The host arrived and said that for happy hour we could only sit in stools at the bar, or in the lounge. The long row of booth seating was empty, but we were not permitted to sit there, unlike every other time we have eaten here during happy hour.  He was actually kind of snotty about it. Well, not wanting to dampen the mood we ignored the tone and gave it a shot, but the heat coming off the stove next to us combined with really awkward /uncomfortable barstools made us ask if there was any way we could please sit in the empty seats. Again, a forceful no. Combined with the insinuation that I was lying about our past visits where we sat at the booth area during happy hour (petty and rude). At that point my son asked if we could just leave! The only other seating offered to us was the lounge area, and if you have been there you know about the posters that would make it awkward for us to sit there. Seriously. The weather was extremely hot and we just wanted a comfortable place to enjoy what we knew would be an amazing meal. Unfortunately, we had to leave. The \"host\" was such a snob, he needs to remember it's the customers that make a restaurant successful. Not turning people away from an EMPTY restaurant. The server who usually helps us was there (long hair) and ready to greet& prepare a table but for some reason we were deemed insignificant by the host. Gatekeepers can make or break a business, I hope the owners know what they are doing with this one."}
{"text":"Christopher's is my favorite restaurant in Arizona. The food, atmosphere, and service is top quality. Everyone in the kitchen is wonderful, and Christopher Gross himself is a gracious and amazing chef. This is my first choice when showing family or guests my favorite place to eat in Phoenix, and I have enjoyed celebrating many special events at Christopher's. Furthermore, the Happy Hour is amazing. Burgers are incredible, as are the wood-fired pizzas, salmon salads, bell pepper soup, cheese plates, and pommes frites. Also a great fan of the duck, seafood, and beef. The petit plates menu provides a great exploratory offering of French cuisine in a smaller serving size. The restaurant is beautiful and I enjoy the clientele. Plus... amazing wine, great service, and a fine menu. Fabulous.   - cam"}
{"text":"We had the most wonderful birthday celebration at Christopher's last night.  The food was divine...especially the sweetbreads, which aren't served in most Phoenix restaurants. The patio was perfect, the weather divine. There were 6 of us, and each of us thought we had chosen the best dish. Our server, Michael, was wonderful... affable, efficient and very accomodating. We'll be back for our next family celebration and many more times in between. G.Robinson"}
{"text":"I cannot complain about the pricey menu because knowing it is in the Biltmore area, I would expect to pay these prices.  The wait/host staff were friendly. There were four of us there for two birthdays. I loved the modern look of the restaurant and was very happy with the service throughout the night. The duck frittes were ordered and enjoyed immensely! Being the only person at the table who liked spicy foods, I ordered the harissa couscous and was expecting a hot dish, but it was served cold. it's not specified on the menu how it's served, but I loved it anyways. It's Israeli couscous, so they are the bigger ones and the harissa was just spicy enough for it. I've had hotter harissa though. Would love to try it hot instead of cold though.  I ordered the lobster pot pie for my entree. Had I been at home, I would have secretly licked the plate. It was delicious! Generous chunks of lobster and the sauce was to die for.  My friends ordered, and I'm not kidding all three of them ordered the same thing, the scallops with lobster sauce. It's not on the menu like that, but they asked for the substitution of the lobster sauce. The waiter gave us no qualms over it and when it was served it was perfect. The scallops melted in your mouth. I can't wait to go back just to try the full plate instead of the bite I had to beg my friend for!  The desserts were amazing and even though they look small, they are perfectly portioned for a full belly..... Can't wait to bring my mother here and spoil her."}
{"text":"With Christopher's new location at Biltmore Fashion Park and favorable experiences at the old restaurant, our expectations were high.  For starters, the new space is much larger than the old and the décor is appealing, casual and modern.  We were hungry and consumed a lot of bread while waiting between starter and entrees.  Each of us tried something different.  We had seafood and poultry.  The dishes left so little an impression that I don't recall what the specific entrees were.  However, I do remember the time between meals felt as if we were dining in Europe and not in a good way.  The food and service were mediocre and the new décor could not make up for that."}
{"text":"As somewhat of a Valley foodie, I've been lucky enough to try some of the best restaurants in the city but have surprisingly never gotten around to trying one of the Valley's classic fine dining destinations, Christopher's. So after a day of work, I decided to try their happy hour, which had gotten a great review from the Republic. Christopher's new space in the Biltmore is nicely designed - clean and modern, with Edison lightbulbs and a warm brown and orange color scheme. The service is great, too. But the food is what matters, and I don't think it stacks up to some of the finest restaurants in the Valley. Here's what I think the problem is - Christopher's opened at a time when the Valley was anything but a foodie town, and classic or contemporary French was out of the question, so he designed a dumbed-down French menu, with more American sensibilities. And since that formula worked, he hasn't changed it. But in the meantime, bolder and more daringly gourmet restaurants have settled in the Valley. Now, Christopher's menu seems tame compared to places like Noca and Binkley's. Back to our happy hour meal - we started out with roasted red pepper soup, ($3.50) which was delicious. Next we had the tomato pizza ($6 I believe) - the crust was excellent, light and doughy, but the pizza as a whole lacked flavor. Rarely do I say pizza isn't salty enough, but this one did. Salmon ($8) was a good deal, but the fish quality was not as great as I'd expect from a place like this. The lemon butter sauce was nice and light, but I've had better elsewhere. Dessert ($9) was darn good - tarte tatin, a warm apple tart with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Overall, Christopher's is solidly good, but it's been eclipsed by a new generation of superb Valley restaurants geared to our new foodie scene."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at Christopher's on 9/27/15, our first time to Arizona for our 20th anniversary.  After a disappointing meal at another \"French\" restaurant in the area, I decided that I could not leave Phoenix without a true French-inspired meal.  So, I canceled reservations I'd already made at another restaurant for that night, and decided to come to Christopher's.  One of the best decisions I've ever made!  My husband and I had saved our appetite for this meal and eat we did.  We ordered a petit charcuterie plate with cheese; a terrine of foie gras; the argula salad; risotto; filet minon; and something I've always wanted to try.....sweetbreads.  Everything was delicious and fresh.  The sweetbreads tasted just as good as I'd imagined.  The service was superb!!  Our waiter, Chris, was attentive but not overly intrusive.  Although we were too full for dessert after cleaning all of those plates (you think?!), Chris even brought out a cute ice cream dessert plate with \"Happy Anniversary\" written out in chocolate sauce.  What a perfect meal to celebrate our 20th anniversary and to end our stay in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  If we ever come back to the area, we will definitely come back to Christopher's."}
{"text":"We liked Crush Lounge better than Christopher's. I guess that means we liked the smaller plates and appetizers better than the entrees. And it's a little pricey if you just kind of like the food. Probably not going to return."}
{"text":"So, the BF and I ate here on Saturday in the afternoon as I had noticed it on a recent shopping trip to the Biltmore.   The decor and ambiance is first class and I found our service to be pretty good, but rich...oh my gosh!! I didn't need to eat anything the rest of the day (which is super unusual for me!) as I was so full from our lunch! It felt like everything was loaded with duck fat, truffle oil and butter, which normally I would not complain about, but this was too much!   We were starving when we arrived, so right away we ordered a yummy bottle of champagne (interesting wine list!), the duck confit salad and the truffle fries that we had spotted as we were seated at our table. The fries were delicious and the portion was huge! The salad was very tasty, but we were both surprised by the large duck leg and thigh on the plate with a yummy, ashy piece of Humboldt Fog cheese and small bunch of greens. It was good, but my goodness was it rich!   The BF was still hungry (how, I have no idea!) and had been eying the polenta and veggie sides, so we ordered those as well. Both were legitimately dripping in butter. Again, I am a girl who loves a rich meal, but this was a bit much!   I will say that as we were leaving, Crush (the attached bar) was packed and both the BF and I commented that we would be up for trying the bar soon as it looked like a fun place to hang out and enjoy their happy hour.   All in all, be prepared for over the top, decadent options that individually are bombs, but all together is a little too much!"}
{"text":"Used to to go to Christopher's old location and loved it but I must say that his new restaurant is more modern and hip.  I feel like I am in a restaurant in New York.  Their happy hour is the best deal in town.  From 3-6pm 7 days a week you can enjoy fantastic food for 50% off as well as 50% off all wines they carry by the glass but you should get there early because many times it is hard to get a seat! Service is efficient and friendly. Also check out their Stimulus wine list!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to even begin..food was ok but.. First the server just had no experience in wine so just offered the most expensive ones to us but on top of that the ones we wanted they didn't even have.  Second the service just lacked in general, took half an hour to get the first bottle we ordered and who knows how long for the second.  Most if not all restaurants will honor a price match if the bottles we ordered are out with a nicer wine but they did not.. We got there about 7:30 and didn't leave till almost 11! By then everyone was just tired of waiting and sitting around! He dropped a glass of water and spilt it and said it was just water.. For spending all the money we did was just regretful and painful and will never go again. I hope no one ever experiences such a pain especially for someone's birthday celebration.  We did have plans to go out afterwards but no one wanted to after this experience."}
{"text":"Several months ago my boyfriend and I went to Christophers for my birthday dinner and it was by far one of the most delicious dinner's I have ever had.  Since then, its been our go-to place for a formal dinner-night out.  The food is delicious, (We even took some great pictures of how beautiful the food looked)  servers are friendly and attentive and mood is awesome.    I would recommend this place over and over again and I can't wait to head back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I did not get a chance as an out of town guest to even try the food.  Was greeted at door by a bald gentleman who I found out later was the supposed manager or duty and who treated us horribly.  He was very condescending, rude and went out of his way to make me and my friends feel unwanted in this establishment.  It saddens me that he is the manager and took money from his employees pockets as we left and found a better place that was more than happy to serve us.  If you don't like your job sir find a new one.  You should easily loose your job for the way you made me and my friends and even other patrons that came in behind us feel."}
{"text":"highly recommended!! the food was spot on. Ordered the hangar steak and goat cheese salad yum yum. I will head back for sure."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars, as I believe it is very difficult to obtain a perfect score through food, beverage, service, ambiance, etc. Christopher's new venture is perfectly Christopher, 5 stars.  First off a little background, Christopher is a native. That's right; he's a graduate of Central High School. He studied in France where he honed his craft and to this day draws his technique from. He has owned now three ventures in Phoenix, first his fine dining and bistro location on the northwest corner of 24st and Camelback (later became Eddie's by Eddie Matney, former hair dresser turned chef at Cous-Cous then Eddie's Grill) then after closing he moved to the restaurant row in The Biltmore Fashion Park, 2rd level to open Christopher's Fermier Brasserie & Paola's Wine Bar. Which in reading many reviews here on Yelp was unfortunately misunderstood. It makes me wonder if people understand what French is, it's not their fault though, there aren't many French restaurants in town, most have be closed, including Mary Elaine's at the Phoenician  and John Claude's Petite Cafe. There are a few that still survive Sophie's and Vincent's, but in this town of chains few people venture for French. Now with Christopher's Restaurant/Crush Lounge he has passed on the wine bar and opened a lounge instead. Christopher does enjoy lounges as he is a regular at Merc Bar, but then so is his smoked salmon which is offered on the Merc Bar menu. So a lounge makes sense, I'm a believer in a chef should open what they are passionate about.   The new location has a different feel from his previous; his last venture echoed a French Countryside feel, as did the food. I think that was why many didn't understand it; yes it was French, but ALL FRENCH IS NOT FINE DINNING. I wish more understood that concept, but this is primarily a beer drinking state, not wine or rather more Mc D's not Mary E's! Hence there's a difference between filling your stomach and filling your soul and leaving a restaurant inspired with the feeling that life is wonderful. Christopher's is the latter.   The design is contemporary with long lines of brushed stainless, white linen and exposed wooden beams. Kudos to whoever designed it, great job! The tables are dressed with white linen, elegant silver and polished stemware. You can't help but feel that it's 'time to dine' when seated. The walls in the main dining room have many vases of fresh flowers that seem to be replaced whenever necessary, nice touch.    The food at Christopher's is exactly what you'd expect, French, without the super-high-end prices. He's still one of the only chefs in town serving Foie Grass and Duck Confite, both wonderful and worth the trip if a glass of juice (wine) is added! I've been there now on 4 occasions and everything is fantastic, flavorful and prepared professionally. Christopher offers daily specials and I recommend them including; Veal Chop on Wednesdays, Roasted Duck on Thursday, Lamb Shank on Friday and Rabbit on Saturday. But don't stop at your entree, get the cheese course for dessert or for something sweet, the Chocolate Tower is one of the best desserts in town, hands down, no question.    Service is another point were Christopher sets himself apart. It doesn't get any better than this. Again it's NOT fine dining, so you can't compare it to fine dining restaurants (but then again there's only one left in the valley - Different Point Of View).  The servers know the food; they can describe anything on the menu and recite the specials as if their job depends on it (if you know Christopher it probably is).  Food is coursed correctly with a few minutes in between, as well as wine service is as professional as it gets. The bread service is as always, French breads with a super rich, euro butter, perfect for lapping up to sauce or vinaigrette remains on your plate.  Needless to say, Christopher does it right, in my opinion, or is it just my opinion? Many of the valley's most celebrated chefs eat at Christopher's, he's know in many circles as the \"chef's chef\". But don't take my word for it, ask the chef at your favorite restaurant, who their favorite chefs are in town, and favorite restaurants, most likely Christopher will make the list!

{"text":"Always a pleasure to dine here. The food is creative and delicious, the service excellent. It was a pleasure to have Julio serve us at our last visit - we followed his recommendations for wine, entree and dessert and all were spot on. As always, I'm already looking forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"My husband and i went here for our 2nd wedding anniversary..We wanted to goto some place that was romantic, quiet and served gr8 food & drinks...We were so glad we came to Chritophers..The food & drinks are expenesive but you get what you pay for...The food was gr8..We ordered escagort ( snails ) , seafood and a duck dish...Tasted really good and so did the wine..I will recommend this place for special occassions..You will not be disappointed !!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Arizona. Great munch menu and good dinner menu. The tasting menu is by far my favorite. I also would recommend the salmon Blt for their lunches. Service is great and very entertaining if you sit at the bar in front of the chefs."}
{"text":"what a fantastic dinner we had last sunday every dishes was marvellous and so well presented in the plate we were 8 french people and really had a great time the service was also excellent  thank you"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service! This has been the third time here at restaurant and just very disappointed. The waiter was just bad!"}
{"text":"A friend was in town recently and wanted a great meal.  Although I had not been there, I suggested Christopher's.  When we arrived we decided to eat at the kitchen bar, but after we ordered out drinks we saw a couple seated outside and decided it was a perfect night for it.  We asked the hostess if we could move and she begrudging agreed.  When we walked outside, she wanted to seat us at the table right next to the door (I think as punishment for this huge imposition) even though there were plenty of other tables available.  We asked to sit at the table farthest from the door to give us some space between the other diner and be in a better position to watch the world go by.  The hostess found this very upsetting and tried to force us to sit next to the door, but after our protestations finally said it would be OK with her if we sat at the other table, but that the server was not going to like it.  She sat us in purgatory as steam escaped from her ears and brought our drinks, but that was the last we saw of any servers.  I did notice the hostess and some servers were having quite a discussion about us and I heard one person say \"OK, fine, we will let them finish their drinks\".  I wasn't exactly sure what that meant, but after 15-20 minutes of being left in the cold and while we were finishing our drinks, the bread guy came by and we asked him to ask someone to get our check.  A waiter finally showed up with a check and was bewildered to find out we were leaving.  However, my impression was that they had decided not to serve us dinner and were simply waiting for us to get the message.  That is a very large space Christopher is paying rent on and that night the restaurant was almost empty.  I would think in the current economic environment his staff would have the good sense to bend over backwards to accommodate their guests, but we were left with the impression that they felt they were doing us a favor by being open."}
{"text":"Very nice dinner.  The food and atmosphere were good, but I have to say I expected better.  Interior was decorated really nicely and our server was friendly.  Definitely worth a try, but may not live up to the high expectations it creates."}
{"text":"I admit it: I have a horrible bias against any restaurant located in a mall.  I assume that all mall restaurants are either a franchise of some awful chain or some restaurant corporation's lowest common denominator cuisine.  Well, I couldn't be more wrong about Christopher's located in the Biltmore Fashion Park Mall.  Everything I had was great:  lobster bisque, duck confit salad, lobster pot pie, and a vanilla soufflé for dessert.  The prices are most reasonable, and there's even a happy hour from 3-6 pm.  Best of all, everything I had was real food, that is, food made from scratch (nothing frozen, out of a jar, can, or plastic bag) from fresh ingredients.  Also, the service was friendly, attentive, and very professional.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, however I am writing about their underhanded business practices. I ordered a travelzoo voucher for $69 that included 2 3 course meals. It said \"Regularly $140\". What we ordered, if had been ordered off the regular menu would have been about $100. However, we were charged tax on the full $140.   Second, even though on the voucher it says \"PLEASE TIP ON THE FULL VALUE OF THE CHECK.\" (which implies tip is not included and we get to choose the tip amount) and nowhere mentions automatic gratuity, 18% gratuity (18% of $140, even though we ordered $100 worth of food at the most) was automatically added to our check.  Third, even if you had ordered the most expensive options, the highest possible amount it could be worth is $120, not $140. It is mathematically impossible to have the voucher be a $140 value, but that is what they add tax and tip to.  Fourth, after we told our waiter we were using a voucher, he seemed less interested in the service level of our table, which i later realized was because he had a guaranteed 18% (of $140) tip.  I just noticed today they have another travelzoo deal \"$79 - AWARD-WINNING FRENCH DINNER FOR 2 W/WINE, REG. $165\", I am posting this so hopefully if anyone is thinking of buying that voucher, they will read this first before they purchase it."}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings about this place. The desserts are truly special, amazing and worth the cost. However,  the poor service from our waiter and the  okay dinner makes this restaurant too pricey for dinner. I'll only be coming back for the dessert.  The Pros  1. Absolutely amazing dessert. I had Christopher's Cheesecake and I've never experienced a cheesecake like it before. It was served warm and had this interesting shell wrapped around it and was really delicious. My girlfriend had the Chocolate Mousse Tower and it too was something I've never quite seen before and delicious.  2. The water and bread person was very good at making sure we had what we needed. Special shout out to him.  3. The Smoked Truffle-Infused Filet Mignon is the tenderest piece of steak I have ever had. The downside is the steak didn't have much flavor.  4. The restaurant's ambience and atmosphere are quite lovely. The sophisticated menu and food presentation makes the restaurant feel very special.  The Cons  1. Our waiter was not at all attentive to us which was disappointing because it seemed like other patrons were receiving much better service. The waiter left us alone far too long and either didn't care or notice as we awkwardly looked around the room trying to get his attention. We mentioned very early in our meal we were excited to try the desserts; however, we waited nearly 20 minutes after finishing our meal before the waiter came by to offer us the dessert menu. When it was time to get the check we again had to wait for some time.   On this visit, we were celebrating my birthday and my girlfriend wanted to try and discretely get the waiter's attention to see if they did anything special for birthdays, but  with poor service she decided not to waste more of our time.  2. As mentioned above, I had the Smoked Truffle-Infused Filet Mignon. For the cost I expected a little more. The amazing tenderness of the steak was enjoyable but for the cost it is something I will only do once.  The In-between  1. My girlfriend had the pizza. It was good, but nothing special. It seemed along the lines of a really fancy frozen pizza."}
{"text":"It was the last day of Restaurant Week so I tried their special menu. The items on Christopher's Restaurant Week menu are not on their regular menu. Fabulous for someone like myself who enjoys trying something new all the time. I had mousse of scallops, braised pork knuckle with lentils, and gateau Marjolaine with wine pairings. The wine pours seemed a little skimpy at first, but by the time I had the Madeira I was doing just fine. The food-wine paring was wonderful and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I went there for a dinner. The service was really good, and the waitress was friendly. The food was so delicious, especially the chocolate tower mousse. I really recommend this place."}
{"text":"OK, so I have a Deal Chicken coupon.  We make the reservations.  We show up.  We get the laser printed special menu, which is ok by me, I get that we won't be getting their finest meal.  We sit. We wait. We order drinks. We wait. We drink the drinks.  We wait. We order dinner.  We wait. Dinner comes. We eat. Waiter never drops by to ask how the meal is. (It's OK) Bread guy is too busy hoarding bread to give any out. When I work down to the last 1/4 of my glass of wine, I find it's full of sediment. I wait for the waiter to appear. Waiter acts as if I brought the sediment in myself and returns with another glass with exactly same amount as before, so you know, I don't like 'get over' or anything, and he brings the check. We leave.  We vow never to return. Nothing special and I don't need the 'tude dude."}
{"text":"I went to Christopher's for my birthday last night and left disappointed. I wouldn't have minded the stratospheric prices if the food had been outstanding but it was not. The rack of lamb was good but not $40 good, and same with the duck. The truffle fries were superb and the calamari was good but not great. At these prices everything should be great.  Interestingly we were the sole patrons - the restaurant was empty the two hours we were there. Owner-chef Christopher was walking around the open kitchen but never came by to ask if we were enjoying the meal. The service otherwise was excellent. But with so many great restaurants in the area like Tarbell's I don't see why anyone would go to Christopher's and pay through the nose for a less than stellar meal."}
{"text":"When I'm casual but want to feel NYC I go to Christopher's.  We go here for a special occasion dinner or on the fly happy hour...which is the best HH food in town!  Let me repeat that - best in town!!!    Hamburger with truffle fries, brick oven pizza or a perfect salmon salad plus a beer or glass of wine for about $10/person. Can't beat it!  Sitting at the open kitchen makes me appreciate the setup and organization required to run a restaurant as well as the chef's tats!?  If you don't want the blaring heat of the brick oven, don't sit at the corner next to it...Phoenix is HOT enough in the summer, so cool off and let someone else do the cooking!"}
{"text":"Only been here once but I am sold! If I am back in the area, I am heading there!  The happy hour is great and the appetizers were amazing too. We had the pizza with tomato on it and it was soooo good!  Their dinner portions are sizable and so very tasty. Cant wait to get more next time!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a martini prior to a movie the other day.  The place was empty...but the staff was extremely polite.  Bartender prepared a fantastic specialty cocktail for the fiancé.  She was very pleased with it. The \"art photography\" behind the bar is terrible.  It's like a novices interpretation of high fashion art and obviously an amateur with misguided high aspirations of his/her own talent.  God forbid a place purchases high caliber works for a space.  Buying a digital camera and hiring some low grade \"models\" off of Craigslist does not make you Man Ray no matter how much you have to drink.  I have had mixed dining experiences at the restaurant ranging from spectacular to terrible.  I guess it depends on the evening.  I have definitely had more good experiences than bad.  The wine selection is competent and the kitchen does not shy away from special requests even when busy which is a major plus.  Specials are often very appealing and tasty. The decor is cultured and better than most if not all other options at the Biltmore."}
{"text":"Dinner was just great, best hanger steak in town, and my wife's barramundi was fantastic. The foie gras appetizer is delicious even though it is more like a duck liver mousse, and dessert was decadent. Restaurant week was a great opportunity to rediscover Christopher's; we will be back"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a date night and it was absolutely wonderful, as always. I had the salmon and my husband had the truffle-infused filet. The service could not have been better. It's our new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"My favorite on my first trip to AZ.   Food - It was so GOOD. Two thumbs up!! The server Carl recommended the best dishes. Lobster salad was perfect. Hanger steak cooked to perfection. Truffle frites OMG.   Service - Fantastic!!! Ask for Carl. A+"}
{"text":"Wow, very impressed with dinner! Have been here for lunch many times and love. The dinner portions were almost more than my husband and I could eat. I ordered the lobster pot pie which had no joke, half a lobster of meat! Hubs had the duck two ways-excellent."}
{"text":"4.5 for meilleur restaurant français in AZ!  Hubby and I decided to have our own private bonenkai (aka year end celebratory party) prior to the crazy nites ahead that await us next week. Using our trusty corporate coupon which operates thru restaurant.com, I paid $8 for $25 value and the meal was indeed sublime.  We started off with the tempura calamari which was off the charts and a perfect plate of goodness. Chef had the batter exactly at the needed lightness to fry and crisp up without any trace of over-oilyness. It came with a tasty tomato frisee salad and flavorful aioli dip. Really there are so many great appetizers to have but we always gravitate to calamari. At other places this dish would be a throw away i.e., quick just batter up and fry, however we believe it's so inherently delicate that a well seasoned and tender preparation of squid can also define a great kitchen.  Hubby went for the catch of the day for his Entree, which was Hawaiian Ono fish made with a butter buerre blanc accompanied with asapagus. His first encounter with this fish which is a cousin of the tuna as the protein content is high and lean but cooked perfectly.   I had the duck done two ways, roasted breast and then confit leg. I never give up the chance at this red meat selection. Seasoned well and done medium as should be with a red wine reduction and cinnamon sprinkling on the plate. The duck breast needs no more compliments as the simplest preparation is the best. However the confit leg had such amazing depth of flavor each bite I literally savored for as long as I could...exquisite!  As if this wasn't enough food between us, our very friendly waiter inclined us to indulge on a side of potato au gratin which was the richest and creaminess plate we've enjoyed in a while.  We both devoured both New Year's Eve, eve, eve dinner delightfully and left no room for an enticing soufflé, but given it takes 30 minutes to bake perhaps we could've...hmmm  Well other house favorites to try is the lobster pot pie and lamb chops are best in town so maybe we'll save that for 2013."}
{"text":"This place isn't a \"bar...\" Its just a joke.  What bar in its right mind shuts down at 9:50 on a Saturday night? Evidently Christoper's is the only one that comes to mind.  We walked in on a Saturday, sat down as there were still some 20 people sitting around having drinks, and were quite brusquely informed that they were closed and that we needed to leave. We asked what all the other folk were doing there, and we were informed that they were regulars and friends and that closing didn't apply to them.  The only time we'll be going back to Christoper's is when its closing for good to mock the owner as he locks the door one last time. Until then, this place can kiss my lily white ass."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Great facilities.  The duck fat frittees are a must.  Our server, Ed, was knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful.  A great experience."}
{"text":"Lounge is sexy, luv sitting & eating at the kitchen table.  Very amusing to watch all the chefs hard at work.  Red Pepper soup was good, pizzas are to die for.  Luv the wines by the glass selection, and the happy hour ROCKS :-)"}
{"text":"Amazing food every time, especially the french specialties. Best foie gras in the valley, and delicious escargot. The ambience is a little quirky, but personally I really like it. Wonderful wine list with some really great french wines by the glass. Prices are excellent for this quality of food, menu variety and service, especially if you order a prix fixe or tasting menu."}
{"text":"Had diner the other night and the food is so delicious best french food in town and grest atmosphere and great wine list"}
{"text":"As with most places in AZ, the service was excellent. Friendly and hospitable.   My date and I sat in a cozy corner table. The menu was quite extensive, so we ended up ordering a variety of dishes. The tastiest was the goat cheese and garlic pizza. The risotto was very delicious, as well as the mac-n-cheese. All very delectable.  We ended the carb-tastic meal with the Chocolate Tower that was to die for. And we almost did with the amount of calories that we consumed.   Overall, very pleasant and delicious dining experience."}
{"text":"So I've been to Christopher's at the Biltmore many times, and couldn't wait to check out the new space.   I'm a fan of the food - at least at the old space on the east end, upstairs, at the Biltmore shopping center.   This location.  Eh?   Very trendy... slick surfaces.  But - okay forgive me I just get SO DISTRACTED by bad architecture it impacts my restaurant reviews.   First, the HUMONGOUS door.   Um, has anyone heard that the latest trend in architecture is BEING GREEN?   So let's install a door where pretty much all the A/C (or heat in winter) can get sucked out of the room each time a new person walks in or out.   (So, right off the bat I subtract 1/2 star for the ridiculously ostentatious and eco-unfriendly door.)   Then, the layout.   Bar to the left, check.  Restaurant to the right - sorta.   A long thin line of tables around the open kitchen.  Awkward layout.  Minus a quarter star.    Service good.  Food good.   But that layout again... sitting there feeling like I'm under surveillance by the staff at all times, ugh.   And it's waaaay too cold in there - oh they must have to keep it colder so that when that big door opens and all the A/C goes outside it can recover quickly, oh yeah.    So then I need to go to the restroom after all that iced tea..... uh.... very fancy uni-stalls - can't blame them for the need to have these superlarge stalls I guess because it's required by the ADA.... but then how do they get away with the absurdly ridiculous unisex, out-in-public \"SINK\" - if it can be called a sink.   So you're done with your business and you are now out among the public to wash your hands and adjust your makeup - ladies, do we want to do that IN PUBLIC?   Methinks not either.  But at this trendy-gone-bad restaurant restroom, the ladies on one side of a big mirror wash their hands over some pebbles with an automatically-activated sprinkler system that serves up enough water for a lineup of maybe 6 or 8 people at a time.  Again, people - we live in the middle of a DESERT.   Water is precious.   And yet here at Christopher's it is triggered to run freely to wash my hands (again, IN PUBLIC) longer than I need and over about a 6 foot wide area.  I just measured my hands and they are only 8 inches wide.  People can disagree about the food - I find it delicious.  I particularly love the grilled salmon and I've had wonderful fresh soups at Christopher's.   At the old location I had many joyous meals and celebrations.  But this new location has just left me flat.   I won't be back unless dragged there by others."}
{"text":"Maybe the food is good but the bald guy at the front door, that apparently was the manager, was unnecessarily rude. Not only to is, but to 3 ladies that walked in behind us. We walked into the kitchen bar that was empty. My friend set his shopping bags on a stool next to him and was immediately told that he needed to move them because there are people that wanted to sit there. Where??? We were the only people there!!! The ladies that came in behind us looked at the menu and said they would be back in 15-20 minutes. One lady says to the other that she would like to walk inside. The bald guy smarts off that they should not make that request in an outdoor mall. Then, turned to me and says \"well! It is!!\"what an idiot. Macys is inside. We left..."}
{"text":"Had the roasted red bell pepper soup, salad, and tomato pizza. Spent way too much on mediocre food. I don't have anything good to say about it. Maybe because I'm a vegetarian I missed out."}
{"text":"I've been to Christopher's several times and there are several things I really like: The atmosphere, being able to sit at the bar surrounding the kitchen, the innovative and varying menu choices. I have had outstanding food - including the duck confit salad with brandied cherries and a sizable chunk of Humboldt Fog (which they don't offer any more).   Recently I had two less-than-fantastic experiences in a row.   We went to Christopher's specifically for the rabbit, which is Tuesday's special. This time it was served with a pan sauce, polenta and yellow squash. My friend who was also getting the rabbit ordered first. She has a bunch of dietary restrictions, so she wanted her rabbit without sauce, and with steamed vegetables. When it came time for me to order, the server did not come around to where I was, which I found odd - if not rude. I said \"can you come around, please?\" and he gave me The Chin, as if to say, just go ahead with your order. So I had to talk across my dinner partner.   I ordered the rabbit \"as it comes, with the sauce\", but didn't want the polenta and yellow squash. I asked if I could have a salad instead. The waiter said yes, and I asked if it came dressed with a vinaigrette, which he confirmed.   Dinner arrived. And I did not get what I ordered. I had naked rabbit on the plate -  no sauce. That was quickly solved, but still. And then the salad I ordered were greens piled on a plate with a side saucier of vinegar and oil. I had not asked for the dressing on the side, in fact, I would have preferred the salad be dressed. So I found myself whisking the vinegar and oil furiously with a fork to get it to emulsify enough so I could put some on my greens. This was not a great dining experience.   Several nights later, I went again and ordered the seafood assortment: salmon, scollop, mussels, and calamari over risotto and some kind of sauce.   Granted, I wanted it a bit different from how it was presented, but I should be able to get what I want.   So my dining partner ordered first (same one as above) no sauce, no this, no that. Then I ordered - \"seafood as featured, except the risotto on the side\".   Here comes my seafood - naked on the plate. No sauce. Clearly, this waiter also did not listen. Sauce was produced on the side, but it's not what I wanted. Plus, about half the dish consisted of calamari that were battered and fried. Nowhere on the menu board did it say 'fried calamari'. The waiter did not mention it. I cannot eat a pile of fried food if I don't want to have huge stomach upset. So I couldn't eat half of my (unsauced) dinner. The salmon, scollop, and mussels were outstanding, though. The risotto (on the side) had zero flavor.   There were several other ordering issues that I don't want to bore you with here, but bottom line is, neither of these (seemingly seasoned) waiters listened to the varying needs of their guests."}
{"text":"Classy French/American restaurant with the chef- Christopher (surprise I know) always on site.  Impeccable dishes prepared perfectly keep my man and I coming back again and again.  Consistently great service, we see Michael and the team in the kitchen really try to make you feel special.  Everything here is house made and the hard work pays off. From the French bread, to the salads and soups, through the entree and especially shining in desserts.  The small plates offer some fun choices with our favorite being the escargot.  Who doesn't love a puffed pastry crust? I still need to try the chicken & waffles.  The butter poached lobster salad is a must have as well as the arugula salad. I'm loving the red wine poached pear and fragrant blue cheese pairing along with the arugula and fennel.  For entrees I am a steak chick so I go to the hanger steak.  Flavorful and nicely charred- this steak is literally my favorite.  They have a nice wine pan sauce accompaniment that brings it all together.  You can't go wrong with the 8oz charred burger because hey- is has more homemade bread and a killer horseradish mustard.  The real win here is the Parmesan truffle fries.  Seriously crave inducing with that trademark aroma and a crisp that won't quit.    Lastly the dessert... soufflé!!! I love the grand mariner or chocolate soufflé so much served with a side sauce and fresh berries.  The lemon tart is to die for if you are craving a yummy creamy fresh lemon slice of heaven.  The lemon sorbet is to die for as well!  The coffee is French press and someday I'll be fabulous enough to end with a cheese course."}
{"text":"Christopher's restaurant is easily my favorite place to eat. I visit regularly during their Happy Hour and every time the service is amazing, the chefs are friendly, and the experience as a whole is remarkable. I can't say enough good things about this place. I would recommend the burger and combo fries or the croque monsieur, both are less than 10 bucks during happy hour. The burger blows the pants off any other burger at the Biltmore, and since Christopher's is a French restaurant, the croque is to die for.   Every one of the staff members is extremely friendly and accommodating, I love this place."}
{"text":"this is a pleasant joint tucked behind Saks 5th Ave, the atmosphere is perfect for a work meeting or casual lunch with old girlfriends. I had the House Smoked Salmon with Crème Fraiche on an Edible Spoon, with a glass of Chardonnay. it was a fresh dish with a nice light taste of salmon. the edible spoon wasn't my favorite idea. it tasted like a slightly saltier communion wafer.   the best part of my experience was the staff, the manager sat down with me at the bar and we chatted over what wines we liked with salmon and the bartender  Josh had a very calming attitude and made me feel very welcome as i sat alone. The chef came out and chatted with me about his experiences and other low key restaurants he enjoyed in the area.  I would recommend this place for anyone, alone or in a group"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this local place during happy hour since it was featured in the Phoenix magazine and we were very dissapointed.  The food was good but our service was garbage.  We ordered escargot, fish special, pizza, and some sweet potato fries and two iced teas.  Our sever had an attitude from the first second he spotted us.  He was pompous and rude.  His remarks were very sarcastic and unpleasant.  On top of that, he fired all of our food at the same time so that everything came out at once and we had no room on the bar to enjoy our meal.  By the time we were eating some of the dishes they were stone cold.  He also never asked how we were doing or refilled our teas.  He seemed pissed that we were just there for happy hour and treated us as \"less than equals\".  He just brought us the check when we looked like we were about done with dinner.  He did say \"thanks\" when we left but that was the nicest thing he said all meal.  Probably cause he got his tip and us out of there.  How rude!  Would not recommend this place if they hire people like that"}
{"text":"The service here is very good.  I've been coming for years, even back to the days when it was less trendy/more traditional French countryside upstairs of the Biltmore.  The waitstaff, despite the hip decor and occassionally foreign menu item, are very pleasant, not condescending, and quite helpful.  What's great is that whether I go for a formal dinner for a special occasion, or with a friend to \"cheap\" it out for burgers and duck fries, the service is the same.    There are some great menu items and you could spend many visits exploring them.  Goat cheese flatbread, gruyere pomme puree, lobster bisque, the burger, the salmon... all rather good.  Definitely a favorite in my rotation.  And nice decor to heighten the mood further."}
{"text":"There are no words that can describe the perfection of food/service/ambiance. Restaurant is perfectly set up. Our server, Remone, was so knowledgeable about wine and food, even helped with pairing the two together. Every bite was delightful.   So say the least about our date night....perfect."}
{"text":"A fine little hideaway for that intimate, special meal.  Service was impeccable throughout the entire meal, and portions were generous.  Not for the budget dining crowd, but shouldn't break the bank either if you're cautious with the wine menu and extras.  Two can get in and out for  under $100 if you need to, and still have a very, very nice time.  If you're in the mood for a splurge, I highly recommend this restaurant and lounge."}
{"text":"We came for a drink before dinner and ended up staying for dinner,  after seeing the delicious restaurant week menu. The Happy Hour is a good deal. I would like to return for that. It was fun sitting at the Kitchen bar and watching the chefs and cooks do their thing. It was also a bit loud as it got busier. We had a cheese plate that was delicious.   Dinner: They were kind to accommodate us and seat us in a quieter more secluded area of the restaurant. It is decorated very simply but trendy and upscale. I particularly liked how they dropped the cavernous ceilings by making floating ceilings. This warmed the place up and looks very cool.  Restaurant week 2013: For $40 each plus $15 for wine pairings, it was  a three course lovely meal. I liked that they didn't include dessert and you got three other courses.  1) Ravioles de Royans vs. Torchon of Foie Gras- winner the F/G 2) Frogs legs vs. Alsation Onion Tart- winner= Frogs Legs.  3) Pork Knuckle with Sherry Sauce vs. Bistrot Tenders with Carmelized onions and  Au Poivre Sauce. Winner- Tied.  The entrees were the best part of the meal. We were surprised at the portions. I always think of French dining  as being rather miniscule. We thought the wine pairing was spot on and a delightful aspect of the experience. I'm tempted to go back and try the salad with goat cheese and the Coq Au Vin...... This is a bit far afield for us to go but we may find reasons to slip in now and then.    Thanks for a memorable meal. We will definitely return next restaurant week!"}
{"text":"Place was empty which should have given me a clue, but for some reason it didn't. I had the butter poached lobster salad, which was recommended. The tiny bit of lobster was very good, but a total afterthought or justification for raising the price of a simple arugula salad to $18. It felt like I was eating a small appetizer and salad thrown on the same plate. The two together just didn't work for me. As an entree I had the scallops, which were ok at best and fairly simple. $38 for 4 medium size scallops and a cup of brussel sprouts was a bit offensive. I don't mind spending money on good food, but I do mind spending good money on mediocre food. Now I know why it was empty - case closed."}
{"text":"Hubby and I needed a splurge night so we hit up Christopher's. The atmosphere is nice, upscale, with a few different seating areas. Very professional service. We were impressed with all of that.  We had 3 glasses of wine.  Still, they have a great (if somewhat snobbish--really, what's this nonsense about \"Anything But Chardonnay\"?!) wine list.They tout a big pour, but it didn't look that generous to me.  We started with the escargot en croute. You get 6 small snails under an incredibly buttery, flakey crust. I wished for more protein, but believe me, not a flake of crust was left on the serving dish. It was so yummy.  I had the duck pizza. I thought the duck was a bit dry and there just wasn't enough flavor on it. I also got the mac n cheese. It was also just ok. I didn't care for the weird strips of ham--seemed like a clunky execution. Both went home with us so hubby could finish the next day.  Hubby got a steak. It's served a la carte, so his $38 got him steak. Maybe 6 oz. In a drizzle of red wine sauce. With a bit of charred something dusted on the rim. While it was well prepared, he spent the meal digging large peppercorns out of it, so they wouldn't get stuck in his gums. The waiter recommended the gnocchi, and it was probably the best we've ever had. Silky smooth texture. It was incredible. I mostly ate that. GET THE GNOCCHI.  We finished with the tower of mousse, which was good.  All in, we spent $174. While it was quite good, I think we wanted to be blown away for the price, since for us it was definitely a splurge. I'm glad we went, but I wouldn't say it was a terrific value. However, given it's location in the Biltmore shopping area, maybe they don't need to care about value."}
{"text":"I finally had the opportunity to go here a few weeks ago and I was definitely impressed.  Its a French place for those who don't know (I didn't)  I had a warm beet soup to start that, believe it or not, was just wonderful. Velvety smooth texture... so nice. Mellow fresh beet flavor...  Main course was the lamb that was suggested by the waiter. Not much to say other than it couldn't have been prepared more perfectly. Great cut of quality meat. Outstanding job.  Service was impeccable and the ladies loved their lobster salads by the way. Yummmmy.  I'll be back again without a doubt."}
{"text":"Thank goodness the restaurant we WERE going to could not accommodate us that night.   I have eaten many times at Christopher's over the years and have always been delighted with the service, ambiance, and above all the food.  Justice, our server, was excellent.   We had  steamed mussels w/white wine broth, homemade ricotta and beet salad, duck thigh confit w/ duck breast cooked to perfection, and to top it off, the obligatory chocolate tower with espresso.  I can say this without reservation, this was the finest meal I have had maybe even ever.   I can not wait to go again.   Trust me, this is one place you want to try.   I would go for your next special occasion out.   For me, that may be to celebrate any given Wednesday evening that it is not over 100F out."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for drinks when my buddy's iPhone was getting worked on. The bar is pretty awesome, the bartenders are very cool and know how to actually bartend. Great drinks. I will be back."}
{"text":"Our 3rd time here! The nightly special of sea bass was buttery and fantastic. The Au gratin potato's were great as well. The burger was good but the French bread  brought it way down."}
{"text":"Ok here is the short and not so sweet.  This place is not good, over priced, and located in the back of the biltmore for a good reason. Just think reasonably good restaurants ie, zin burger, tru foods, capital grill are all visible in the front of the biltimore. Ok enough said on location.  We came after happy hour, apparently the time where this place is semi decent because food and drinks are half off.  We ordered drinks that were overpriced and short pours. It is a wannabe higher end wine lounge. ok on to the overpriced and over salted food.  Beet salad was decent. Wild mushroom pizza was more salt than pizza. Burger was burnt and truffle fries were ok.  The kicker of the evening were when 2 women showed up and decided to sit next to us, when the whole lounge was empty. Anyways, they were loud and winey and complaining how they had been recently dumped (I wonder why?) Then Christopher Gross came outside. My husband and I thought he was making the rounds, which would have been nice, but that was not the case. He sat his right next to the obnoxious girls and fed into their bitching. He even supplied them with champagne.  Well I guess if my restaurant was completely empty I would hit on pathetic patrons too. So you guessed it, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Mid-week a few co-workers and I had a great night at Crush. We instantly loved the atmosphere and got comfy in a velvety plushy booth near the bar. There were maybe four or five small parties present, and the place was packed. And, it was a Wednesday night ... I'd hate to see the place on a Friday night.   I was going to get a glass of wine, but when the waitress told us about their signature drink, the crush, I knew I had to try it. Champagne with a lavender-infused liquor? Yum! I loved it.   Instead of going into Christopher's and order dinner, we decided to snack on some small plates. First, we enjoyed a cheese platter - chef's choice. My favorite selection was the Farmhouse Chevre, a creamy goat cheese. The other three selections were very good as well, but the Chevre was by far my favorite.  We also snacked on a bowl of house marinated olives, which were enjoyed by all three of us. They were very good, but you do have to love the olive to enjoy ...  The very best was the pizza, which was delicious and different. The crust had the savory flavor of foccaccia, but it was light and airy like a pastry. We had our pizza with wild mushrooms and shallots. It was unbelievably good. I can't wait to go back and have it again soon!  I'm looking forward to grabbing some girlfriends for a bit of shopping at the Biltmore Fashion Park and then drinks at Crush!"}
{"text":"Christopher and his A Team delivered 5 stars on New Years Eve!!  We chose the tasting menu to start the new year right!! Gary had the sweetbreads-- soft, tender and juicy with an amazing sauce-I had the smoked salmon with creme fraiche and a chive panne cotta topped with cavier...,amazing!! Second course-/ Gary had the lobster I rave about! I went outside of my normal box and got the chestnut soup with Fois Gras!!!  Wow!!the combination of taste and texture was something I will dream about!  Main courses were amazing as well! By this time we are stuffed!!! Did I mention the portions are extremely generous????? It was an amazing evening-- Happy New Year to all!!"}
{"text":"We went to Christopher's a few years ago when it was at the old location.  It was our anniversary, and we looked forward to a similar experience for dinner.  Unfortunately, we were really let down and both agreed to not give it another shot -- especially given the high price.  A lot of reviews here talk about Happy Hour, so maybe that would have been a better experience but we won't be going back to find out.  Here is a quick breakdown:  service 4 stars - very friendly and courteous.  No complaints here at all.  The only ding is that he served diet coke that was clearly flat and we could not spot one bubble in the glass.  The second one was a bit better but still flat.   18% gratuity was automatically added which was sort of strange, but I would have tipped him at least that much anyway.  lobster bisque 3 stars (had way more cream & less lobster taste)  truffle-infused filet mignon 3 stars - we ordered this medium, it came medium-well to well.  Was lukewarm and the truffle-flavor was very subtle and easy to miss.  Flavor was overall average.  Duck 2-ways 3.5 stars - no complaints here but did not blow us away  souffle - 1 star - This was probably the worse souffle we've ever had.  It was missing some ingredient, but did not have substance or taste.  presentation looked very good though.  We've had this at Zinc Bistro and other french restaurants in the valley and this one was disappointing"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here today for Date night during Restaurant and Oh My God!! The food was so good. I had the Duck Confit for my second course and I thought the flavors were so well combined along with the wine pairings that they recommend. I would definitely return to this place any day."}
{"text":"I missed the hype. Totally missed the hype. My friends and I decided to host our birthday dinner here back in April 2017. We found Christopher's by googling \"best fancy restaurant in Phoenix for dinner\". Christopher's came up. We checked out pictures, read reviews on yelp and decided let's give it a try. We had a party of about 10 on a Saturday night. There was also another party of 10 and a part of maybe 7. No other patrons dining in the area we were in. I could be wrong but I only remember seeing 1 other server besides ours. Perhaps the reason for the slow service. The extremely slow service.   I ordered the servers recommendation for a Cabernet. I had 2 glasses, they were pretty tasty. On the other hand, The margaritas were sour. The mojitos were sweet and you couldn't really taste the mint. Everything, everything we ordered lacked flavor, dinner was so bland, seriously lacking basic salt and pepper. Everyone ordered something different and no one left satisfied. In addition to he bland food taking forever, those that order d side dishes of mac and cheese had to wait an additional on 15-20 mins.   Hill stone was my first option. I should have stuck with that. Christopher's was a horrible birthday dinning experience and I wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"Christopher's is my favorite restaurant in this world. Everything on the menu is fantastic, and Chef Gross does a great job of making his patrons feel welcome. The chefs behind the counter are extremely friendly and patient when I sit there and ask all my curious culinary questions. Shoutout to Taylor, his hands make the best burger in the state. The happy hour is unbeatable, so much in fact that I think I'll go down there today for an early dinner. Great Job Christopher's!"}
{"text":"Always a delight! Definitely one of my go to restaurants good happy hour fantastic spot for a business lunch or weekend lunch.  My dinner choices always vary but my lunch \"go to\" is always the scallops, fabulous flavor and always prepared perfectly, you get two good size scallops with a seasonal vegetable that varies this trip was brussel sprouts last time was an assortment of colorful grilled cauliflower.  My last visit found they are also now giving you a pasta with it, the sauce and pasta will vary but this visit it was almost a southwest sauce that had a slightly pepper flavor to it it was so good I used my fresh bread to devour the remaining sauce.  Okay now the BAD, in all honesty I probably would have given it 3.5 stars for the server(s) it is hit and miss.  The four stars are well earned for the assistants to the server, you always have water/iced tea, you always are offered more delicious bread and your plates are never empty in front of you for long.  If they are busy the host/hostess will always pitch in to help if they pass by and see something needs to be taken care of.  That is the way a restaurant should be run none of this \"that's not my job\" mentality that so many other restaurants have.  This last visit we waited an almost unacceptable amount of time for our server after receiving water and bread.  Cocktails took a while considering they were not busy and our order was not that complicated, unfortunately not an isolated incident like I said hit or miss.  My visit before that we had a little wait for our server and then was presented with the wrong bill that took a long time to correct after waiting a long while for the bill in the first place.  A great restaurant though always enjoy and it's always nice to see the owner/chef in the kitchen pretty much every time we are there....Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Great meal and service.  Chef's tasting meal with the wine pairing was a great experience and a very good value.  The scallop with caviar was wonderful.  The duck breast was perfectly prepared and delicious.  The cap rib eye was outstanding.  Loved it.  Will be sure to visit when they move the the Wrigley mansion."}
{"text":"So we decided to check this place out. It was my birthday dinner and we wanted to try something new. We started with the Charcuterie plate that had parmesan and manchego cheese, two types of salami, chorizo, prosciutto, seranno, cured beef, pesto, grain mustard, pate and cornichons. It was pretty good, I'd order it again.  The wife decided to order the Scallops du Jour, which were seared and served with tomato thyme broth and squash. I have to say this dish was disappointing. The tomato creme was made with yellow tomatoes, and just tasted like butter. The squash was simply steamed, no seasoning. You KNOW it's not a great dish when my wife doesn't even finish half of her scallops.  I went with the smoked truffle infused filet. I had a choice of sauces, and went with the red wine reduction. The steak was good, a tad underseasoned though. The reduction was way over reduced and tasted like gravy. it also had the \"sauce skin\" on top by the time it came out, not very appealing.  Luckily I like gravy, but not what I'd expect from a fine dining restaurant. I'd order the dish again, just maybe with a different sauce.    I decided to order teh curried duck frites. Awesome, awesome, awesome! Huge bowl of super thin pommes frites tossed in curry with chunks of crispy duck throughout. By far the best thing we ate here.  Wifey wanted dessert so we had the mousse tower, which was very good.  I had a few glasses of a good Bordeaux and wifey just had a beer. The wine menu was extensive, but I was dissappointed at the low amount of wines by the glass. Wifey and I have very different wine tastes, and would never be able to agree on a bottle.    The service was great, and the ambiance even better. It was a tad stuffy, but I expect that from the fine dining. Overall a good experience, but nothing to write home about..except the duck frites...."}
{"text":"I love this place and it makes a great impression on first dates. Not only is the atmosphere great but the place is top notch all around. A+ on the food, drinks, service, staff, and ambience. i often ask to meet the cook Christopher and he is more than happy to come meet his patrons.       You will never have anything but an awesome time at Christophers Crush"}
{"text":"I enjoyed our lunch two weeks ago.  Felt so spoiled by  the wait staff and my guest was so impressed.  Thanks"}
{"text":"Christopher's is fabulous. it is a MUST. The food Is great and service fantastic. The waiters are from a variety of places. It is not very crowded and the chefs can relax while cooking."}
{"text":"Before they moved downstairs and abandoned their bistro menu, Chistopher's Brasserie was our favorite.  They, moved, went chic,  dropped sweetbreads, and we dropped Christopher's after one disappointing visit.  Well, all is forgiven.  Sweetbreads are back and are spectacular.  The frisée salad is still the best salad in the valley.  Terrific wine list.  Delicious sides and a huge, very innovative and interesting small plate/appetizer menu.  A bit pricey but still outstanding value and wonderful service.  This place is a winner."}
{"text":"We arrived on time  and were seated timely for Valentine's meal. We elected the wine pairing 4 course option The smoked salmon was average, the  foie gras   Lobster and scallops for the second course we're good but far from outstanding  My lamb was good to request with a tasty sauce but we waited for our wine pairing and by then both entrees had cooled My partner had the chicken. Again, a tasty sauce but the chicken itself was tuff.  Worst of all the waiter didn't have a clue about the wines and they were never poured timely to the course The restaurant environment is less then conducive  to a romantic dinner, especially when the waiter kept hovering to clear the dishes and move each course along before its time Not a bad meal at all if our expectation was Applebee's and the prices were those of a similar level restaurant.  Quite a disappointment for what Christopher's is supposed to be"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved my experience here. The food was to die for, came out on time, waiter was very attentive, wine was delicious. I will definitely be back. Great time great food great night."}
{"text":"Loved the happy hour!  The wines by the glass were reasonably priced, we ordered two pizzas.  I wasn't crazy about the crust they use but that is just because it was different than what I was hoping/expecting.    Damien was our waiter and he was perfect.  Not hovering but never ignoring either.  In addition to loving the happy hour prices their homemade bread was to die for.  I could go there just for that!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there a couple of days ago.  Food was excellent, but service was horrendous.  Took 20 minutes to get a cocktail and about 45 minutes to get our food.  Lots of chit chat among staff (and Christopher was there), so not sure what was going on."}
{"text":"Tried the pizza in the lounge area, was pleasantly impressed.  I had the duck confit and date pizza, which also had soft gobs of goat cheese for a salty flavor.  The crust was rubbed with rosemary and dark and crispy, just perfect, while the spice added a sweet flavor that was really special.  All in all I was pleased with the experience and would definitely come back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is a very nice French geared restaurant. The experience was overall very pleasant. We were in a large group of 10 so it did take a while for us to get our food but it was well worth it. I ordered the express lunch for $20 which includes 3 courses. The food was very tasted and what you would expect from a higher end dinning facility.  My complaints are small and not a big deal but there is only one toilet for each the men's and women's bathroom and no sink in the toilet room...at dinner time this may be an issue. Other than that the atmosphere is great and so was the French inspired food. Did I forget to mention the French bread was excellent!  As Arnold S. would say...I'll be back!"}
{"text":"So I met up with the Girls last Friday for some gossip, wine, and snacks.  I had never been there before but it came highly recommended so I gave it a shot.  The pluses: a killer parking spot at the back of the Biltmore, a wonderful server, and a good glass of wine!  The \"room for improvement\" comes down to economics...repeat business demands some deals.  I am a supporter of those kinds of places as I live in Central Phoenix and I love fine dining just as much as anyone else but simple math dictates the number of times I indulge.  Maybe it's time to offer a pricing for \"locals\" and maybe beef up the happy hour offerings ???"}
{"text":"Christopher's has half priced wines by the glass at happy hour!! And did I mention they have a book of wines, not a list, which makes choosing a few rather challenging!   The food was fantastic! I had a hamburger with Gruyere cheese and mushrooms, which I gulped down in about 5 minutes because I was hungry and it was YUMMY!   After 3 hours of sipping wine with new and old friends at the food bar, I decided it was time for dessert! The Chef, Christopher himself, brought me out an impressive chocolate tower!! I am still dreaming of it today!   I had a wonderful and pleasant time at Christopher's. You can tell the staff goes above and beyond to make their patrons happy and they are very friendly!  I definitely need to come back and have a 'real' meal. From what I saw from the 'kitchen' bar, I will not be disappointed.  And I am not sure there is a better happy hour in town considering the quality for the price!"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight with a friend and enjoyed a truly fabulous meal.   Amuse-bouche: Smoked Salmon on an edible cracker shaped spoon - truly brilliant!   Appetizers: Butter poached Lobster with golden beets on a bed of lettuce & Chilled pea soup Christopher's crusty French bread served with soft, sweet butter is always appreciated and forever addictive!  Main Courses: Hanger steak medium rare with pommes frites Butter poached Lobster salad with golden beets (yes, it was so good it was ordered TWICE!!!)   Desserts: Chocolate mousse tower & Lemon tart with lemon sorbet  Christopher's has been a consistent \"perfect 10\" with us for many, many years as we've been coming to Camelback & 24th Street since the 90's. We know that we can stop in anytime to have a wonderful meal. Tonight was no exception. What more can we say ... How about this?  Move over Donald & Hillary -  Christopher for President in 2016! He'll get things done with style to spare.  \"Make America Delicious Again\""}
{"text":"Had a wonderful visit at Christopher's.  We have been going here since they were across the street from the current location.  The appetizer we enjoyed was the escargot, charmingly referred to as \"snails\" on the menu.  The pastry covering the escargot was light, flaky and wonderful.  The butter and garlic the escargot was sauteed in was superb, easily the best in Phoenix.  My wife loved the lobster puff pastry.  It had a beautiful looking crust.    I enjoyed the truffle infused filet mignon.  It was done absolutely perfectly and was a delight.  The desert we had was amazing; the berries tart with the homemade, well Christopher's made ice cream.  Even the coffee was perfect, a french press of coffee.  All in all another wonderful visit."}
{"text":"**Original review from 5/3/2011. Updating new profile.**  I cannot complain about the pricey menu because knowing it is in the Biltmore area, I would expect to pay these prices.  The wait/host staff were friendly. There were four of us there for two birthdays. I loved the modern look of the restaurant and was very happy with the service throughout the night. The duck frittes were ordered and enjoyed immensely! Being the only person at the table who liked spicy foods, I ordered the harissa couscous and was expecting a hot dish, but it was served cold. it's not specified on the menu how it's served, but I loved it anyways. It's Israeli couscous, so they are the bigger ones and the harissa was just spicy enough for it. I've had hotter harissa though. Would love to try it hot instead of cold though.  I ordered the lobster pot pie for my entree. Had I been at home, I would have secretly licked the plate. It was delicious! Generous chunks of lobster and the sauce was to die for.  My friends ordered, and I'm not kidding all three of them ordered the same thing, the scallops with lobster sauce. It's not on the menu like that, but they asked for the substitution of the lobster sauce. The waiter gave us no qualms over it and when it was served it was perfect. The scallops melted in your mouth. I can't wait to go back just to try the full plate instead of the bite I had to beg my friend for!  The desserts were amazing and even though they look small, they are perfectly portioned for a full belly..... Can't wait to bring my mother here and spoil her."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! As soon as we arrived, we were treated well by the staff.  Crusty bread and butter was promptly brought out with water.  The mushroom soup was decadent and rich, I've never had anything like it. The salad was fresh and tasty, I don't usually care for beets and these were great. My love and I shared the filet mignon and scallops with a side of au gratin potatoes. The scallops were the best I have ever tasted and they were served in a lobster butter sauce that was scrumptious. The filet was melt in your  mouth delicious.  And the piece de resistance was the chocolate tower. Ours had a raspberry sauce on the bottom, along with the vanilla sauce. The chocolate mouse was perfect, the presentation beautiful.  We will be back some day! It is a special occasion restaurant for our budget."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend because we wanted to have a nice & romantic date night. This place definitely has a romantic & fancy vibe to it so expect a pricey dinner. We ordered the calamari & escargot for appetizers & both were very yummy. Then shared the lobster pie & side of ham Mac & cheese. Lobster pie was good but was small & more like a lobster biscuit to me. Came with a whole piece of lobster sandwiched between 2 thin flaky biscuits with a typical pot pie cream sauce with peas & carrots. Mac & cheese was pretty good & it had a smoky taste to it cuz of the ham but I wouldn't say it's the best Mac & cheese I've ever had."}
{"text":"Not good, not good.  We had a nice dinner planned at Crush Lounge; unfortunately there was an accident with a member of our party and we were unable to attend dinner.  Hilarity then ensues.  They make you SIGN A CONTRACT for DINNER.  That's right, that meal you eat every day now requires paperwork.  In this case, it's several hundred dollars to NOT EAT.  I'm going to quit my day job and start a business not serving dinner for $750.    In a post-apocalyptic world, if I had choose between eating at Crush Lounge or chewing my arm off, I'd go with the latter.  And then I'd use the stump of my arm to sign the contract."}
{"text":"To be fair, I have only tasted their restaurant week menu.  There regular menu might be executed better, though I doubt I will be back to find out.  For those of you trying to select which restaurant to try for Restaurant week a word (or many) of caution.   I decided to go with the wine pairings, which were ok though nothing to write home about.  Let me start with the bread, as I have come to judge a restaurant on this initial offering.  While not offensive the baguette had a chewy almost stale exterior-nothing like the crust you would find in any boulangerie in France.  I do wish that American restaurants would serve homestyle bread or even focaccia, rather than a poorly executed artisanal bread.  I did appreciate that the butter was salted and at room temperature rather than ice cold.  Onto the appetizer: I opted to start with the ravioli with truffle essence and fine herbs.  The only redeeming element of this dish was the faint flavor of truffle.  The pasta itself was tough.  It actually reminded me of the refrigerated ravioli you can buy at Trader Joes.  The broth that it came in was ok, but nothing that you would want to soak up the extra with your bread.  The best part of my dinner was the 2nd offering-the scallop mousse.  It was seasoned well and had a texture that would remind you of a cross between a panna cotta and egg custard.  The flavor was fresh, though the few peas on top were a but starchy.  I ended the meal with the sole entree. The sole lacked even the tiniest bit of salt or pepper, as did the steamed cauliflower beneath.  The sauce swirled around the perimeter of the plate was quite tasty, however, each element of a dish must be seasoned properly for it to be enjoyable to eat.  Given that I had expected to gorge myself on delicious food, I had eaten a very small lunch.  After leaving over half of the tough pasta and an entire filet of sole, I left the restaurant still hungry and set back $70.  If in the Biltmore area and looking for a nice meal, I would suggest Seasons 52.  Although not as trendy or fancy, I also have had much better food at Zinburger and True Food."}
{"text":"Love love the late night atmosphere! Very romantic!!  We wanted to get the tasting menu but since the restaurant was having a party in one of its private rooms. It was unavailable for the night. So, we got the seafood platter - which was just okay. It has raw oysters, but since I don't eat uncooked oysters I didn't have any. The roasted bell pepper soup which was good initially but got too creamy at the end. I probably shouldn't be such a pig and shared it. The butter poached lobster and argula salad was pretty nice mix. For the entrees, we had the truffle infused filet mignon, the duck two way, and duck confit, goat cheese, and fig pizza. Sad to say, I only got to eat a couple slices of pizza and a piece of the filet since the soup left me too full for much of anything else. But my date said the duck was delicious.   I guess it just calls for a re-visit. :)"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday and it did the trick for a nice restaurant with a special occasion environment.  They've modernized it from the old location and added some new items to the menu.  I got teased for ordering a pizza at such a fancy place at first but by the end of the night everyone agreed the duck, goat cheese and fig pizza was the best dish of the night.  Service was excellent and while the portions aren't huge they're not laughable miniatures either.  Good place that has been around for a long time yet keeps evolving."}
{"text":"Holy Cheese Balls! This place is amazing! I wanted to spice up our monthly date night and this was by far a feather in my hat to be certain.  I made a reservation, even though I was a smidge skeptical on what the term, \"casual elegant\" really meant without looking up the term. As we first entered the restaurant, you will be overwhelmed, just alone on the door.  We were greeted very openly and were taken through the restaurant, which passes the very nice bar area and seated in a wonderful, quiet, and romantic area of the restaurant. However, each area is most likely just as nice.   Our host and the servers were personable, professional and prompt. We ordered the mushroom soup, hanger steak and fingerling potatoes for one entrée and snails, arugula salad, brussel sprouts and rack of lamb for the next. Oh my word, what a feast. In order to push the envelope, I ordered after dinner coffee and we HAD to try the famous chocolate mousse for one desert and I had 2 scoops of the chocolate sorbet. Hello, I didn't even realize there was such a thing. If I had a straw I would have drawn out every savory drop from the bottom of my dessert bowl.  SO yes, this was an outstanding pick, definitely coming back again. For the very discriminating folks, the sunflowers in the suspended vases were not of my taste, the candle holder did not blend well with the place setting and ambiance and yes, someone recently wrote about a cracked toilet cover, but in reality, we are here to dine."}
{"text":"Anyone in the mood for duck? Then you HAVE TO come to Christopher's. No one does duck like this man. Need a wine pairing. ALL, not one or two or just the bartender, knows exactly what to recommend. Have friends in the Valley and need to impress them with your culinary wilds?  Stop researching and get your tookas over here!!!!!  They will fall over when they try the tasting menu.   Basically, just get over here and say hi to me and my Mom. We are totally here."}
{"text":"Went for reataurant week and left in utter disappointment!! Do they not get it:  this week is for showcasing and trying to entice people to return?  First and foremost, the service was oblivious and downright terrible.  It was amazing, a total lack of any semblance of service by a number of staff.  Our server was terrible, just seemed to try rushing us to be done and was exasperated when we asked for the simplest things; We saw one server reach down to pick up a napkin while holding someones food.   Onto the food:  boring, unispired and not very good!  Example:  the foie gras was served with 2 small crostini and a sprig of lettuce.  Nothing more.  Usually, a gelee or compote is present to soften the flavors.  The french onion soup was terrible...awful tasting broth, bad tasting onions and unmelted cheese.  The fish was small and tasteless.  Dessert was weak, but at least edible.  For the price paid, this was shameful.  No chnace any of us will return."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar where they cook the food and that is the best seat in the house.  They have a pretty good happy hour, all of the food and certain glasses of wine are 50% off - good deal.  Food:  The happy hour menu is more limited but a good deal for the value.  Had the wild mushroom, fontina and argula pizza.  The crust was fantastic, the toppings were a bit bland and needed a little salt.  Also, shared the cheese plate with crostinis  - good, as expected.  The wine we had was fantastic.  They have a good wine list.  They were making homemade ricotta when we were there, which was cool.    Our server was fantastic.  Atmosphere - good  As a foodie, the only thing that would have made it better is the cook being more willing to talk.  I asked her several questions about what she was making (when she wasn't busy) and she gave short answers and it was clear she didn't want to talk.    I tried this place because the chef won the James Beard Award so my expectations were extremely high.  It was good but it didn't quite meet my expectations of five stars!  I would however go there again as the menu looked fabulous!"}
{"text":"We eat out often....4 or more times a week.  Once again, we had probably the best meal we have had in ages.  Almost flawless!  We do like the ambience, but the food is more important to us.  We all had fish....one had the incredible scallops, one had the salmon (FRESH) oh, so good , and two of us had the Sea Bass. All four of us were 100% impressed with the way the food was plated, the freshness of the fish, and the simple,  wonderful prep, including the vegetables on the plate.  Two had the caesar salad and it was a bit bland this time and someone had the escargot and thought they were outstanding.  It was a wonderful evening and the servicer was excellent and added to it being a wonderful evening.  Thanks."}
{"text":"it was too expensive for that you are getting.  I ordered 6 oysters and paid 24 dollars from them?!!?  plus they made me sick as a dog the next day.  What a joke.  The truffled frittes sound amazing when described, however they are gross and oily!  the salmon was all right, but soaked in butter, again oily... and i got a steak. it was small and the flavor was too salty...   again, it sounds better than it is, if you want to pay a lot for the atmosphere, then go ahead...  or try tarbell's in phoenix.  at least he actually won iron chef america!!!"}
{"text":"Really great experience!  We were able to get a reservation the day of and chose to do the Restaurant Week menu.  The food was delicious and Christopher himself came by several times to check on us.    The cocktails were well balanced and although we didn't go to Crush Lounge, I'd definitely like to go there for drinks sometimes.  Definitely a must-do again!"}
{"text":"Just like before they moved, great food, spotty service.   For starters, I walked in alone and asked if my other party had arrived. She said 'No'. Ok....no problem. I immediately became distracted by a gal I knew that works there. We chatted for about 3-4 minutes. I said, hey, by the way, can you check to see if my party has arrived? She did a quick check on their  computer and said \"oh yes, they're here\". Wow!!! Quickly got over being annoyed and was directed to the table.   Oh, my! I just love what you've done with the place!  The decor is funky and hip. Lots of clean lines and interesting textures.    For appetizer, I got the assorted beet salad w/ goat cheese and roasted pistachios. The presentation alone made my mouth water. It could've been roasted shoestring and I would have eaten it! LOL! The plates are large, white  and square with contrasting angles. Makes any dish look 50% better. The app was great! The goat cheese melted in my mouth and the beets were perfectly sweet on their own.   So I got the Friday special which is braised lamb shank w/ assorted root vegetables. To my surprise it was also garnished w/ wild mushrooms. This would have been nice to know... as so many folks don't like or are allergic to mushrooms. The lamb was fall off the bone tender and flavorful. The root veggies were amazing!   Sidekicks: The side of steamed asparagus was over-done. The mac and cheese rivals City Hall's. I said RIVALS. Not beat. Rivals. You know how I adore my Mastro's City Hall Mac n Cheese!!! The creamy polenta was top notch! Last but not least, the sauteed spinach was yummy in the tummy also.   Let's go back a bit. The 12oz filet was good. Not steakhouse good. But good.   One more step back, the Pinot Noir the server suggested (from CA) was good. A little sweet for my taste, but good. I should have known better and trusted my own instincts b/c he didn't seem to know much about his wine list and the characteristics of each wine. Oh, and did I mention that he never came back to fill wine glasses!?! Geeze dude! I can't say he was new b/c I didn't ask. I just know that Christophers has NEVER been on my top list for great service. Just great food.   Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Average at best. Eye is off the ball.  Average food.  Weak service.  Too many other better choices.  I knew I should have questioned this place as I came from the covered parking section and noticed trash and boxes were left out by the wood pile.  I almost didn't go in for that reason, now I regret that I did."}
{"text":"So I had a Deal Chicken for this place... we had an overall good experience.  There was a separate menu for the Deal Chicken people which was nice - it was a 3-course meal for 2. The choices we made were:   1) A Lobster Bisque that was out of this world - best I've ever had! 1) Mussels in delicious broth with chunks of cured Chorizo - out of sight!  2) A Tuna Confit Salad well seasoned & lightly dressed - delightful! 2) A Mushroom Risotto that was rich & creamy - and oh so good!  3) Braised Lamb Shank w/Gruyere mash - absolutely spot on! 3) Braised Pork Belly w/\"Creamy\" Parmesan Polenta - tasty, but see notes.  One of my complaints was the Pork Belly dish - it was cut too thick for our liking. I'm no expert, but it seemed like it could have been executed better. And we found out that after I ordered, I received the last of it for the night, it was taken off the menu, so maybe I got the crappy piece at the end? It was still good but we took most of it home & it is going to be applied to 2-3 other homemade meals for the fat & flavor (which I have to say I'm looking forward to!!). Also the Creamy Polenta was not creamy at all - it was served with a tough outer layer, & was very dry.  Oh yeah, the second complaint was that they serve tap water that tasted like crap! The least they could do in this upper scale place is serve FILTERED tap water!!!  They had an extensive wine selection, but not so extensive on the beer selection.   Otherwise, we had a wonderful time talking with another table who also participated in the deal & were lots of fun to share dinner time talk with. The service was great!  We were impressed with the food & will consider coming back, the location is far for us & it is a little pricey, BUT MOSTLY WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"In the too-long decade I lived in the desert, I frequented Christopher's in both locations and it never failed to impress.  Christopher Gross is a Paris and NY-educated chef who shows his pedigree every day in quality, presentation, charm and the ability to keep staff in a region with constant turnover.  He's a reminder that nothing is as good as a chef owned restaurant, but I wonder how he has tolerated the sports-obsessed desert for so long.  He's too good for it."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Everyone is so nice and the food is off the charts!!! Loved the Express lunch menu!!!"}
{"text":"Ok here is a review that I hope helps everyone. My wife and i went to Christophers 2 nights ago for her birthday. I need to say I own a restaurant and bar in the phoenix area.  mI am a chef but i sincerely rate restaurants on their food, service and atmosphere fairly and most importantly from both my wife and my personal experience.  First the atmosphere. I have traveled throughout the USA and Europe. Dined in every conceivable type of restaurant.  All i can say about the atmosphere in Christophers is BLAH ! Plain Jane ! needs improvement. Next the food: In the price range of Christophers......THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES. I frequently spend 40-75 dollars per plate a la carte style for dinner. NEVER complain about price for quality. So what is my complaint. The quality of the food was FAR below their menu price point. Wife had Lobster Bisque as an appetizer...should have been called flavored cream soup. I had the tempura calamari.....ZERO FLAVOR ! Ny Strip for main entree...anyone have  a saw ? Really pathetic ! Wifes obster pot Pie was decent with the exception of the THICK cakey encrusted lobster. Tough flavorless and just ruined the dish.  Macaroni and Cheese with ham....have to say was pretty good on the top but VERY runny and milky underneath. Truffled Frites.......NOT BAD ! Or should i say nicely cooked and flavor was good......seasoned well and presented well. NOW Dessert....Chocolate Tower.......UMM...TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT ! As a signature item needs some attention and a wow effect was no where to be found.  Sorry Christophers but.......I believe your days are numbered without some drastic changes. Too many better restaurants in the Biltmore area to visit again."}
{"text":"I've been a regular at Christopher's for years and find the happy hour to be a delight.  Yet I am disturbed by the service.  The host and servers almost always seem to be busy even when the restaurant patronage is low.  The kitchen is open but the chefs (with the exception of Sean) seem to lack basic people skills.  They could take a page from Noca where there is a good deal of fun interaction.  Otherwise put the kitchen out of view.  Servers could use a bit more interpersonal training.  I had Brad who seems to be an exception to this.  This is a good neighborhood restaurant.  Just needs tightening in the interaction department."}
{"text":"I recently went to Christopher's with my friend who was visiting me from Chicago and as foodies as well as her and her boyfriend having a (culinary background), we tend to gravitate toward not just amazing food, but wonderful culinary experiences. We both ordered the 5 course tasting menu paired with wine and let me just say... it blew us away.  Upon reading various reviews about Chef Gross, we were both very impressed by his awards varying from Open Table's Diner's Choice, Local Eats 2010, and Phoenix Magazine's review, to Food & Wine Magazine's Top 10 Best Chef as well as a James Beard Award Winner, his resume speaks volumes about his food.  His food also spoke for itself.    We were welcomed and had the best service - he was amazing. He knew not only all about the vineyards, notes, and nuances of the wines but also where the Chef was going with it. What he aimed to bring out in the food with the wines.  What was supposed to be a 5 course menu ended up being a treat with an additional amuse-bouche and cheese course compliments of the Chef!   The amuse was a beautiful smoked salmon with a playfully crafted edible spoon, which yes, was more than one bite, but clever.  First course, was a perfectly butter poached scallop in a leak butter sauce that was dreamy, second came the generously packed truffle risotto, third was the large portioned foie gras and mushroom soup, fourth was the extra tender lamb with a squash hash, Chef inserted the cheese course consisting of the manchego, aged cheddar, Humboldt Fog, and Valdeon blue, and of course the final dessert course and we chose the chocolate tower and berry tart.  I honestly could go on and on about the food, but will spare you in saying that as girls who have experienced the fine dining of places like Alinea, Everest, Le Bernardin, and Fleur de Lys, just to name a few... it was up there and well worth it.  We were both very surprised that this restaurant is featured at restaurant.com due to its caliber, but we're also girlies on a budget so it was a welcomed deal and an amazing treat since we purchased a $100 credit for $8!  The meal was well worth the full price and beyond.  The portions, especially for a tasting menu, were very large... and oddly enough got larger as each course came.  We both left extremely stuffed, but loving every bite!  Chef Gross is inventive, has great intuition, and his dishes are succulent with perfect textures.  I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Let me begin this review by apologizing in advance, to all I offend and the other previous yelpers who have reviewed this establishment with such high regards.  My companion and I were greeted by a warm welcome by hostess and immediately seated at our table.  My first impressions of the waiter was that he was both friendly and attentive, that would be the saving grace(if any) of this experience.  While there were many open booths and tables, we were seated in between two older couples in the back of the restaurant. It was so quiet, I asked our waiter if we were allowed to talk.  We ordered the bottled water service and received our menus.  Upon receipt of the menu, my eyes lit up.  There were so many dynamic choices and eye catching listings, that I was having trouble deciding upon both my appetizer and entree.  I ordered a dirty grey goose martini with extra olives and my companion a glass of Cabernet.  My martini was not dirty at all, which made it somewhat enjoyable as it was just chilled vodka,  but the blue cheese olives were abundant and phenomenal.   Our first course arrived and we had decided to share the sweetbreads and the vegetable risotto.  I was a few bites in when it dawned on me that I was about to have an \"Avalon\" moment.  An exhilarating menu with food that falls infallibly short.  The sweetbreads were covered in some charred type substance neither of us could make out. The sweetbreads were tough and had absolutely no seasoning. The lack of seasoning would become a trend of the entire evening.  The vegetable risotto is not listed or advertised correctly.  It is a small layer of sauce, a few kernels of arborio rice and a pile of vegetables.  I like vegetables as well, but when I am ordering risotto, I would actually like the starch as well.  The risotto needed more than a few pinches of salt and the sweetbreads were inedible.    I thought at this point, that the entrees we had ordered would save the day.  I would be wrong.  My companion ordered the house specialty, the squab.  In my twenty five years of dining, I have never been so embarrassed for a kitchen, as i was for this kitchen, when the food was tasted.  The squab was supposed to be a two legs, confit style, and two breasts that were roasted.  Oh my.  How this dish was able to leave the kitchen I will never quite understand.  It was entirely undercooked, gamey, unseasoned, uncuttable and overall ghastly, just ghastly.  My scallops looked appealing, but for a thirty-two dollar price tag, I was hoping for a bit more than four scallops and a small stack of greens.  Nevertheless, i forged ahead and gave it a try.  The scallops were undercooked, underseasoned(see a trend here?), and utterly tasteless.    My dining partner and I stared at each other for a few moments before we started laughing. One of the best parts about having a really bad meal is that you get to joke about it for a while and the bad meal repays itself in comedy.  That would not be the case here.  When the bill was brought to me and I opened to review, my mouth hit the floor.  Fifteen dollars for that crappy martini? Fourteen dollars in water? We figured that one out, that the waiter brought us a new bottle at the end of the meal, without us asking us and the bottle remained 95% full, but we were charged an additional seven dollars for it.  The bill of $154 dollars, was an outrage to say the least. The squab was inedible, the scallops a disaster, and the appetizers a joke.  Sorry for bursting the bubble for people on this one, but my recommendation is to PASS."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Christopher's (old location and now new) for about 10 years.....   I can't think of a better restaurant.   I can go on and on about how wonderful they are, but if you need a restaurant to go to with great atmosphere, friendly staff and awesome food, this is it.  - Don't go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Just had the most amazing meal at Christopher's and had to write about it. Not only is the service exceptional, the food is extraordinary.  First off, the restaurant itself is beautiful inside.  Very elegant, modern and romantic.  There are several different private dining rooms as well as a more casual up-scale bar area that also offers outdoor patio seating.  Christopher's  is perfect for group happy hour, private group dining or a romantic dinner for two.  The wine list is extensive and the menu offers many choices from small plates to traditional multi-course dining options.  The cuisine is mostly French although I noticed wood oven pizza on the menu which would be perfect for the bar or for lunch.  The meal:  we enjoyed a few different appetizers to start including Christopher's House-Smoked Salmon served on an edible spoon ~ delish! Not to mention,  so much fun to eat!  We also ordered the 4 cheese plate with olives along with foie gras ~ all incredible! Christopher's house made bread complement these appetizers perfectly and is absolutely out of this world!   For our main course, we ordered the Lamb Neck (serves two - we did not realize this until after the fact so there was more than enough, even for take home!) and the Duck Two Ways. The presentation of both was a work of art.   I had to take pause  just admire the food and take photos. Everything was just so exceptional!    Christopher is known for his desserts so I could not wait to check out the dessert menu.  We enjoyed a completely edible crispy cinnamon bird's nest that included an edible candy coated egg  filled with chocolate mousse. It was absolutely delightful to break into the egg shell to discover the decadent  filling.  I loved the whimsical nature of this dessert and cannot wait to come back to check out the other desserts on the menu.   Christopher is a remarkable and talented French Chef who is a legend in the Phoenix fine dining scene.  It is a worthwhile stop for any foodie, especially if you like French food."}
{"text":"If you like French food this is THE place to go in the valley. My wife spent many years in France as an exchange student, and she absolutely loves this place. French food isnt for everyone, but if you like it this is a place you need to visit. I was educated on the whole wine/cheese thing the last time I was here. It was hard for me to figure out how the wine/cheese pairings played together, and I tasted what the big deal was with the appropriate pairings. We typically go for the big 5/6 course tasting menus or special dinners they have.  The service and food have all been excellent every time we have been."}
{"text":"Wow!  Christopher's is a great restaurant.  I am still new to the area and it was a little hard to locate, but worth the search.  The BEST calamari I have had.  The salmon was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of sauce to season.  The Lobster pot pie was excellent.  And the service......Fantastic!  The Bartender for happy hour, the host, support staff and the server were amazing.  I was there on business and they knew when to approach and when to stay back.  Water was always filled but never intrusive.  This may be the best restaurant in Arizona."}
{"text":"I've lived in this city a long time. I've heard great things about Christopher's for as many years as I can remember - and even better things about the happy hour. I never made in until this week for Restaurant Week. Shame on me for waiting so damn long!  My dining partner and I decided to share each course so we could sample more of the offerings, and we both opted for the wine pairings for each course.  First up was a bowl with goat cheese filled mini ravioli with herbs and truffle in the light and lovely sauce, and the mixed greens with goat cheese in parmesan crust. Both were a great way to start the meal  - but the winner of the two was the salad.  Second course we shared frog legs and an onion tart with bacon. It was my first experience with munching one of Kermit's kickers - I thought it was tasty, but my companion felt it was a bit under seasoned. The onion tart was PERFECT. (Hands down winner of the course - we each lamented sharing it, wishing we had each ordered our own.)  Third course was sole sauteed with lobster sauce and coq au vin. The chicken was perfectly cooked - still super moist and juicy, and the flavor was solid. The sole, however, was heavenly! Absolute perfection on a plate. Rich, but still light filet of sole, the lobster sauce was almost a bisque. Served with cauliflower, this is definitely a dish to return for!  We shared a great chocolatey dessert - with killer chocolate sorbet! (the sorbet was better than the layer cake) - and a great little plus was being presented with a restaurant week celebratory baguette after we'd paid.  I will definitely be back - it's so good, and so close to home...Christopher's, you are now on my regular rotation!"}
{"text":"Since I am a happy hour junkie I rarely do sit down \"fancy\" meals. Husband was out of town and a friend had wanted to try Christopher's. being that is is in my backyard I never think to go here. I have done happy hr at Crush and his old place on the other side of the Biltmore but haven't had a sit-down here. Anyway it was so cozy at the bar where we sat. Friendly server and amazing menu. There is not one thing that didn't look appetizing on the menu. We started with the wild mushroom soup with foie gras and the escargot encroute. Both fantastic! for the main we shared the bone-in prime rib ($60) and a side of truffle frites ($8). To be honest the fries didn't taste like truffle to me?? and they r double fried so not a fave.   This spot is for me a special occasion place. Dinner would have been $200 with tip if we didn't have a restaurant.com cert. But needless to say with the discount its  a steal! I will be back to try dessert next time. We were so stuffed after a btl of wine and 2 glasses of bubbles. I also wanna try the burger on happy hour : )"}
{"text":"I headed over to the BIltmore to kill some time earlier this week and as I walked by Christopher's I saw a Lavazza coffee umbrella outside. This is one of my new favorite brands of coffee and decided to grab a cup on their outside patio. When I walked in I was a little worried that it would be too stuffy as the host was in a vest and tie and I was in shorts and a t-shirt.   Fortunately he was very friendly and I enjoyed an entire French press of Lavazza (putting me pretty close to a heart attack with all the caffeine). Great service, free wi-fi and it was only $5 for what was probably 6 cups of coffee!  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were given $150 goft card by a group of teachers to show appreciation for a project we did with them. Frankly, we can't afford such expensive eateries so had never been and were slightly intimidated to go, so we saved it for special occasion.  We went ther on 6/3/16.  Decided to savor all the flavors by trying the tasting menu which cost the entire $150 card, but we decided we could afford a bottle of wine to accompany the special dinner.  When time to pay, they denied use of gift card saying it had expired. That hurt, as a couple living on SSI that hurt. So basically Christopher's got paid $150 for nothing and we were stuck with a $250 tab (including tip).  That's a rip off, taking advantage of a school teachers' gift, and two disabled customers."}
{"text":"What a wonderful lunch today at Christopher's...I could not believe how quiet it was considering the amazing food they deliver from this kitchen!  I thoroughly enjoyed my perfectly cooked salmon with sauteed haricots verts - fresh, flavorful and simply delicious.  For dessert we enjoyed the chocolate mousse tower and the cheesecake - wow, just wow...complete works for art!  Nice atmosphere, great service and amazing food - a winning combination!"}
{"text":"The  food is great but the service is no better than McDonalds.  I had water and a glass of wine spilled on me by 2 different servers.   Once the help improves I can't wait to go back and enjoy the food"}
{"text":"We did the worst thing you can ever do to a waiter.  Ever.  We showed up 30 minutes before happy hour and some of our group, who shall remain nameless, wanted to wait until happy hour started before anything was ordered.  At first the waiter was visibly upset by this but he soon warmed up to us and never for a moment gave us anything by amazing service.  Perhaps because it was his birthday he was in such a good mood he decided to cut us some underserved slack.  I enjoyed a bottle of wine with friends which is something I don't usually enjoy.  I shared some olives and a pizza as well.   The pizza was amazing but honestly the olives stole the show.  They are warm and for $5 you get so many it's easily a meal.    I will almost almost assuredly go back for, if nothing else, those olives."}
{"text":"This place is the best! Christopher is so talented and just amazing. His Foie Gras is to die for, absolutely exquisite."}
{"text":"My go-to restaurant. Beautiful space and delicious food every time. I've been for lunch, happy hour and dinner and it doesn't disappoint. From wood-oven pizza or a hamburger, to duck confit or lobster pot pie, I love the menu and the extensive wine list that goes with it."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed the duck confit salad and ease of wine pairings by the waiter Edward, as well as attendant.  Christopher's Crush is a natural draw to me when at the Biltmore. Service, including attentiveness, was five star. However, the young sous chefs may not realize that the chatter and glances, especially at gals walking by the restaurant, are obvious and distract from the exemplary experience at Crush.  Other than the detractors, the salad, wines, and waiter and attendant, made the Crush an enjoyable lunch reprieve. (Bread was worth a return trip.)"}
{"text":"This French-American restaurant and lounge presents a chic and modern vibe.   What I like about the setting is that it has an open kitchen so you really feel a part of the restaurant and watch the chef in action if you sit in that area.  However this flashy atmosphere didn't have the great food I would expect from the setting.  Here's a breakdown of what I liked and didn't like about the food selections.  No appetizers were ordered.  However the chef offered us a complimentary duck pate for starters.  The duck pate was good and simple and had a rich flavor.  However it was complemented with a very strong mustard sauce and very lemony salad.  The mustard seed with olive oil sauce was too overpowering for the light duck pate.  And the salad didn't seem it was mixed well.  The vinaigrette on the salad tasted like lemon juice.  For the main course, we had a lamb shank and filet mignon.  We also ordered a potato au gratin as well for the side dish.  The lamb shank was the best main course.  Lamb shanks can be cooked with a light meat taste or heavier like in this case.  The gamey taste of the shank complemented well with the mushroom risotto sauce.  The meat came off the bones just beautifully. Be sure to complement the dish with a more medium to full-bodied wine.   The medium rare filet mignon was disappointing.   It was overcooked in parts of the filet and the texture was off.   Sometimes I felt like I was gnawing at the meat.  The peppercorn sauce just didn't fit well with the dish.  It would've been better if there wasn't any sauce at all.  I've just had better filets before.  The potato au gratin came out beautifully.  Parmesan cheese and cream mix made the light and moist.  Adding cream really made the difference and I could even eat it after it was cooled down.    Now on to the dessert.  We choose their signature cheesecake.  This isn't what you would normally expect from a cheesecake.  It was garnished with a champagne honey sauce, light layer of almonds, fresh strawberries, and a decorative sugar piece.  The cheesecake itself was awesome.   However I couldn't stand the sweet champagne honey sauce.  Eating that sauce with the cheesecake felt like eating sugar with a cheesecake texture.  Overall opinion, flashy, but not so much substance.  Especially for the price we paid.  Most of the dishes were ok, but the complementary elements like the sauces made the dishes worse.   The main thing I would like to see is that the chef would make sure that every element of the dish will work well together."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the number of great reviews.  We were there at 8:00 on a Saturday night and the restaurant was less than 1/2 full.  Maybe it has gone downhill and Yelp reviews haven't caught up yet?  I should preface this by saying I don't like sending food/drink back unless it is really, really bad.  But our group wound up sending back at least one item from each course here.  We started at the lounge where we got a bad scotch cocktail which was replaced with a (surprisingly chilled) glass of red wine.  Other notable lowlights included the signature mushroom soup, which was served half full of mushrooms which hadn't been properly rehydrated and were still crunchy.  The goat cheese salad was a lump of goat cheese that had been so overcooked that it tasted like leather.  And the poor lamb had been cooked to a medium well plus.    The space is very nice and parking was easy, but the food was memorably bad."}
{"text":"Brunch was so delicious! Had the omelet du jour, ham, spinach and shallots with potatoes side, my BF had the French toast. We both ordered bloody Mary's and everything was outstanding. Super friendly staff! Top notch start to finish! Will def be back for more."}
{"text":"Drinks and apps is all that I had at Crush.. I loved the staff! Attentive and sweet... LOVED the martinis... good ambience.... and its a good start point on a night out"}
{"text":"Love the food and the Ambience.  The staff is awesome...and really have a terrific sense of humor...along with the chefs.  I love sitting at the bar which circles the open kitchen and talking to the chefs as they prepare the food.  This is truly a mouth watering experience from beginning to end and they know just how to do it up right.  Now that we have been there several times...it's hard going anywhere else.  I love the way they do the roasted bell pepper soup...along with the duck and rib eye..and the raspberry soufflé....I can't resist going much longer than a week.  It's a totally hip little place with trendy jazz oozing from the speakers.  All  in all a great place to feel special inside and out with your squeeze."}
{"text":"We were lucky to have been invited her by some friends for dinner one night.Both the food and service were excellent!  The Duck two ways was perfectly cooked and full of flavor.  Also make sure to get yourself a pot of their French Pressed coffee after dinner.  I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Christopher Crush brings french cuisine to the valley in a classy yet trendy atmosphere. I had the pleasure of finding this place through one of Arizona's many restaurant weeks.  Christopher Crush is located in the Northwest side of the mall and the easiest way to get in is through the parking garage. There is tons of ample parking and just a few steps away from parking your car.  The restaurant has a small patio area and when you enter, there is a giant glass door with decoration. To your left you can see the lounge which has a fun ambient atmosphere. There are a lot of reds tones, nice rose colored couches and fun pictures adorning the bar. We haven't tried the bar yet but next time we visit, we will make sure to enjoy the lounge.  The inside of the restaurant has a large kitchen which is open and clean. You can see the chefs at work and there is even sitting in front which is separated by a beautiful counter. There are several sitting sections for groups which helps to separate the noise in the restaurant. I appreciated this as it helped to make it feel more intimate. the wall was sleek, with sunflowers in small skinny tubes on the walls.   Our waiter remembered us from our visit over a year ago. They give complimentary bread and butter to help draw you into the culinary experience. They have a giant wine list, if you want a mixed drink list, you need to ask for a menu. My husband ordered the Penicillin and I ordered the Sherry drink. The drinks were both fantastic and worth the price.   We ordered our meals, I picked the foie gras, duck confit and the apple galette. First off the foie gras here is exquisite!! Literally if I had to describe it, it is similar to a butter consistency as it melts in your mouth. With a hint of a rich meaty taste. If you have not tried this, it is worth every morsel.  The duck confit as so scrumptious. The meat fell off the bone and the skin was so crispy. My husband ordered the hangar steak with Gruyere gratin potatoes. The potatoes were rich and the cheese was the perfect combination. The steak was cooked rare for my husband and the flavors were so bold. The meat was perfect and not chewy in the least bit.  Finally I had Apple Galette for dessert. The bottom was thinly sliced apple slices that formed a circle. The whole thing was caramelized with a light caramel sauce underneath. there was even caramelized sugar on top with vanilla ice cream. It was the perfect compliment to our meal.  Overall, I lover Christopher's and we will keep coming back. They also have daily brunch specials and pizzas. I haven't tried those yet but in the future, I will give it a bite. Great service, great cuisine and a passion that can be tasted and enjoyed through every step of the meal."}
{"text":"We walked into the Crush lounge to have after dinner coctails. We waited  for 10 minutes. Walked up to the bar and the bartender didn't offer us any service. The lounge wasn't busy at all. We left with no service."}
{"text":"Happy hour here is fabulous- excellent food and beverages and the prices are extremely reasonable. The owner is personable and goes out of his way to ensure that each guest leaves smiling."}
{"text":"Omg this place was amazing. I'm in the car on my way home now writing this review. My boyfriend and I did the restaurant week menu. For an appetizer we had the foie gras and the scallop mousse. We both liked the ones we picked better. For dinner he had the pork knuckles and I had the coq au vin. We both LOVED his pork knuckles. For dessert I had an amazing cake (don't remember the name). It tasted like a mix of Ferrero Roche and tiramisu. He had an amazing chocolate mouse tower. That was amazing as well.   Non food related things that impressed me:  I loved the lounge and the bartender had only worked there 3 weeks and was very hospitable. Also love the bathrooms! There's a dripping waterfall under the bathroom mirror to wash your hands. Also the kitchen is completely open! I can appreciate a restaurant that has nothing to hide!   They also have us a baguette to take home with us. I have no complaints for this place! Loved every minute of being here!"}
{"text":"Um I flippin' love this place. LOVE. The foie gras, blood sausage pizza is richhhhhhh... but man is it good.  Haven't been disappointed here yet!"}
{"text":"The food and the atmosphere were 5 stars but the service was 3. Our server started out great, but at the end of the meal it took forever to get our change. I felt like he was taking extra long in hopes we would leave the full difference. Never a good feeling to have after a good experience. Overall I would return."}
{"text":"Just my all around favorite restaurant in town. Doesn't matter what I have, I instantly feel relaxed and excited just walking in the door. I wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"Met up with some fellow Yelpers for a post OYE after-party last night. And, being at Christopher's reminded me how great a Happy Hour is to be had there. You have to sit around the bar area to get it on the deals, but for half-priced wines it's totally worth it--even if the weather was perfect outside.Nevertheless, enjoying a delicious French Bordeaux for the price other places charge for cheap house wine sorta makes you feel like you're getting away with something. Those are the types of Happy Hour deals I like.  The burger I had last night wasn't as great as the ones I've had previously. It was a smaller patty than usual (dwarfed by the bread) and it was overcooked. But, usually their burgers are great, so I won't knock off a star for this one sub-par experience. Plus, the wine had me in good spirits.  I will definitely return though. I haven't really seen too many wine lists, nor Happy Hours, that can compare to Christopher's."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this fine restaurant. No other place in town can beat their Happy Hour. I just had the most amazing asparagus soup I've ever had. I am never disappointed when I come here. You can watch the Chef's prepare food right in front of you. Oh, and yes,,,  pay attention Sam Fox...  anyone who handles food here wears gloves. Thank you Christopher for attention to detail!"}
{"text":"First of all, the wife and I do enjoy this place.  The food is very good, if not great, and we never leave hungry.  Of course, we routinely order $100-150 in final tab price meal.  I've had the filet, perfectly cooked and good, but a bit salty.  I've also head the salmon, which is a bargain on the menu... $18 yields you two relatively large strips of salmon over mixed vegetables, in a delicious butter sauce with lemon taste.  I've had the seafood platter twice as an appetizer my wife and I shared.  Also, the toper of chocolate moose is one of the best fancy deserts I've ever had, anywhere.  Almost worth going just for that.  Please pay the $9 and be grateful it's one of the better values on the menu... perfect date desert.  Their fries are very filling... duck fries our outstanding.  We use restaurant dot com for $25 and $50 and $100 certificates.  I'm not sure I could spend $150 for a couple at this restaurant and feel good about it otherwise.  But getting $75 off $150 in food allows for going crazy, and when we go nuts when we get these, especially for 80% off, we have a good time and the reastaurant still comes out ahead..  Just had dinner there last night with my 9 year old daughter... special night out.  I ordered the salmon, she the mozzerlla and tomato pizza for $12, which was huge and could have fed two kids.  But I would never bring a younger child here.  No drinks, finished with the tower of mouse, which my daughter thought was the coolest thing she'd ever seen, and $50 before coupon, $25 after.  This is a terrific date night or special occasion place to dine, and the cool modern decor is an interesting compliment to the french cuisine."}
{"text":"Best fresh baked bread in town. Great atmosphere and very professional staff. We usually sit at the bar, it's always fun to watch the food preparation and happy hour is one of the best around. I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"The smallest glass of wine for $15.00 including the aluminum wine label, never ever going back."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday lunch with friends there. loved the Smoked salmon BLT. Friends were very happy with their burgers and they brought out delicious desserts to celebrate my big day."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town.  Yes, I said it. Better than the famous Pizzeria Bianco.   I have been eating at Christopher's since 2005 I believe (at their old and better location) I'd say I was there 25+ times.  Never had any issues with the service.  Plus: where else will you get such a soufflé?"}
{"text":"Three words: Lobster pot pie. Dear God. Each time I put my fork through the perfectly decadent crust, I was overjoyed at what seemed to be a magical, endless supply of meat."}
{"text":"We went there again on Saturday. The service was great this time! David was great. Our dinner was good, no doubt about it. But we were missing the WOW factor we had the time before.  Myshroom foie gras soup was the highlight. Escargot was dry. Lamb special was good.  Can't say it is one of the best meals I had in AZ but I would definitely recommend it! I will go again soon to see if the first experience was by chance or the second one :)"}
{"text":"I love the design.  We walked into Crush lounge and had a drink first.  Very friendly bartenders, great decor.  There are 3 giant original and sexy photographs above the bar.  The main dining room is loud and energetic, which I like, and the design is super contemporary and open.  Lots of glass.  The menu is very French, but not intimidating.  The bell pepper bisque is really good, but as a healthy eater I noticed how heavy it was.  I also had the filet mignon au poivre, possibly the best filet I have ever had.  The only reason I cannot give 5 stars is because of our server.  He was good, but he had a lot of tables and I noticed he was rushing us a little.  Overall, this place is world-class and I will be back to Christopher's very soon."}
{"text":"Christopher's is a restaurant with a French Accent. The Chef/Owner was formally trained in France and is a James Beard Award Winner. The Atmosphere is sophisticated and maybe a little classic. This is fancy dining, tables are set with linen and heavy silverware.   They started us off with some crusty baguette (baked in house) and some salted butter. The butter is unusually good, studded with salt flakes and isn't like any butter I had anywhere before.  My first course of three for restaurant week was the salad of House Smoked Salmon with Squid Ink Brioche and a Cream in an edible cheese spoon. The Salmon just melted in my mouth and was sliced with expert precision. A whimsey but masterful edible cheese spoon adorned my plate.  Sole with Chive Sauce and Radishes was highly recommended by our waiter so I jumped to go with that. It was just as great as any great fish I had anywhere and was seasoned to perfection.  Dessert was a a Lemon Tart in Berry Sauce with Frozen Lemony ice in a lacy edible shell. This was one of the best desserts I had anywhere. The perfect lemon taste and a smooth light but richness held in by a thin perfect crust. The lemony ice was an eye opener with flavor and presented in a detailed edible very light shell.  Everything exceeded my expectations.   Service was very professional.  The Chef thanked us for coming."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous cocktails. Great Wine list. Fabulous food. Aaron was awesome. Can't wait to go back there again."}
{"text":"Recently we stopped in for drinks at Crush Lounge.  Fun location and very trendy bar.  I love the burlesque decor and ginormous bottles of champagne-what more could you ask for!  A small, intimate setting with fantastic French music in the background.  Fantastic for conversation.  Drinks were yummy-I am looking forward to returning to Christopher's to try out the food because it smelled delicious!"}
{"text":"I went here with a few friends to try it out during restaurant week.  The servers are attentive.  The food is amazing and very french.  Overall great meal."}
{"text":"Had a groupon so we decided to try this place out. It's like a lounge, restaurant with a really  nice, quiet and intimate ambience, to the point where it's almost too dark to see the other person. The food was good, very creative style dishes. We really liked the lobster salad we had, and the duck curry fries on the side. We shared steamed mussels w/ chorizo and shallots (the guy at the table next to us was raving about the shallots) and the arugula mushroom pizza. Those were good, but I think I liked our small plates better.   We also got wine, and I'm not a big wine person, so I was a little peeved when our server had suggested the most expensive glass on the list when I told him I didn't know what I wanted and I don't like wine that much. Seems a bit sleezy. He did pour me slightly more wine than my boyfriend, but I don't know if it was worth the extra $3.50. We probably wouldn't come back here, but it's nice to try once to see what they have. I think there are probably more restaurants out there that are equally as good or better. There were also a lot of fake looking people that dressed really slutty, like older people who want to seem young so they can hang out at a lounge afterwards. Not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for Valentine's Day.  They called to confirm our reservation, which would have been fine if the guy on the phone was intelligble.  The service was really great.  I enjoyed the pork belly and my husbands duck was good.  I didn't care much for my scallops or the risotto.  I would go back to try other meals on their menu."}
{"text":"What a great stop for cocktails after work!  Good happy hour specials and the appetizer menu looked tasty, but I didn't order anything.  The wine and cocktail selection is vast.  The location is somewhat obscure in a shopping center, but I would visit again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Just had to share with fellow Yelpers...this place is amazing.   Just stopped in for a quick glass of wine and Wow!   What an amazing experience.  First class service and style.  Ended up sitting at the bar area next to the open kitchen.  Watched them make some amazing HH food with impeccable care, style and taste!  I ended up trying the BEST burger Ive ever had!  Grilled and then melted some incredible cheese in a pizza wood fired oven!  Served with fries or a salad!  It was amazing.  Michael my server was incredible.   Thank you.  I'll be back with my girl next time soon."}
{"text":"ASK FOR JOSE. The food is fantastic, but the service can be TERRIBLE. I eat here all the time and if I am seated in John's section.. I leave (no joke, he is so rude)."}
{"text":"Usually enjoyable, but valentines day menu sucked, so i ordered off the taste menu and the portion sizes were appropriate for a 3 year old. Went there expecting duck and gnoche, left with empty wallet and empty stomach."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on Open Table. Surprised to see the location of the restaurant so hidden in the back of the Biltmore. Thomas was our server, he was so attentive. My husband and I were headed to a concert, so we had to pass on the tasting menu due to time. My husband ordered the arugula salad which was very tasteful. I ordered the Pork Chop, by far one of the best I've ever eaten, seasoned and cooked to perfection. I also ordered a side of the daily risotto which was Parmesan, spinach, and tomato... this was my favorite dish of the night. My husband ordered the burger and Thomas recommended \"Italian Style,\" which meant shallots, cheese, toasted bread not a bun, it was so flavorful! I love that they grind their own meat there, just means there's no yucky fillers. We will be back to try out the tasting menu and we will request Thomas as our server! Great hidden gem."}
{"text":"Well rounded I say.  Modern Moma-like decor.  Stylish food.  Gracious server.  Our food came out tout de suite with the $16 mixed grill salad being satisfying yet large enough for my husband to take some home.  I was hesitant to get the scallops for the $34price so went with the $24 hanger steak medium rare with grilled onions.  I didn't get any sides since it was still 2 more servings after the meal.  It's pricy but cool."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. I have been to Christopher's a handful of times and each time there has been something that has made me question the snotty behavior of our servers. Just because my friends and I are on the younger side of the Christopher's crowd (read: under 50) and frequent the place for happy hour, does not mean we are trash or deserve to be treated as such. The following is a sampling of true stories that I have encountered.   Scenario 1: 2 of our party of 4 waited at the kitchen bar for 10 minutes after being seated without being acknowledged. No \"I'll be right with you\" or any greeting at all. The waiter saunters over and asks if they would like something to drink. How are they supposed to know what they want to drink? They had to ask him for a wine menu and for that matter a dinner menu as well. 10 minutes of sitting, wondering who their server is, wondering when they would get a menu.... too much wondering.   Scenario 2: The kitchen bar was full during happy hour so they reluctantly obliged to letting us sit at a high top right by the kitchen bar for happy hour since happy hour is only supposed to be at the kitchen bar and the Crush lounge area. We order our first round of wines and the waiter knocks over a glass of red wine all over one of the girls in our group. LUCKILY she was wearing a dark top anyways but the waiter didn't even apologize. I quote, \"Obviously I didn't mean for that to happen\". That was it. He didn't even help clean it up, he had the busser come over to help her pat down. I understand accidents happen, but apologize for it. Just don't be rude about it. If he would have apologized we would all have a better perception of the place but even beyond that incident, he was short and rude with us the entire time we were there.   Scenario 3: This scenario is hard to explain via Yelp review, so please forgive me if it seems blunt/rude/etc. I will be using terms like Asian and White a lot but none of it is meant to be offensive. My friend and I, and another table of Asians, were the only non-white tables at the restaurant. I'm not one to judge based on race, but it just so happened to be something I noticed. I overheard a white table ask the server how the ahi tuna was. The server then told the man asking 'Oh that Chinese guy over there ate it and finished his plate'. .... Ummmm what is that supposed to mean? I don't understand the significance of an Asian guy eating the tuna and how that is supposed to make it sound good or make it sound desirable for the other patron of the restaurant. He could have just said 'that guy over there' if he was trying to say other people have ordered it and enjoyed it. His ethnicity had nothing to do with it.   So why do I keep going back you might wonder? Well. Their happy hour is amazing. The food and drink specials mean that we go there expecting rude service, we typically get rude service, but we are able to have a nice dinner, a couple glasses of wine, all for about $20 a person. I will probably go back. I love the wines, the fries, the pizzas, the cheeseburger, and the filet of salmon salad (basically the whole hh menu). Depending on the service the next time I'm there, I plan on telling Christopher myself. He is usually there but I'm not sure how he would react."}
{"text":"We went to Christopher's with the Deal Chicken 3-course dinner.  The food was very good and the service was just as good.  The lobster bisque was a bit too thin for my taste and is something I would pass on in the future. The lamb was delicious and the tuna salad was tasty as well.  We opted to order dessert and the mousse tower was delicious.  We were saddened that they did not have the grand marnier souffle on the night we went, which was highly recommended.  Will return!"}
{"text":"Couldn't love this place more!  We stumbled upon this by accident while looking for a store in the mall.  The hostess came out and told us we had cute little dogs and when we asked if it was dog friendly she said, \"Yes!!!  We had already had dinner, but we saw a cheese plate on the small plates menu and thought wine and cheese would be nice.  Well, we ended up staying for 2 hours working our way through the cheese selections and several small plates.  We absolutely LOVED the steak au Poivre, the chicken and waffles, scallops with vanilla dust (my favorite), and the various cheese selections (cow, sheep, and goat's milk options).    We loved it so much we came back for lunch the next day and had mushroom soup with a very generous portion of foie gras, a half order of lamb cooked medium rare to perfection, curried duck confit served over straw frittes (cut super thin and fried to a perfect crispness), egg baked in red wine and mushrooms (which is great served on crispy toast), and a dark chocolate mousse tower with vanilla bean and white chocolate creme anglais...tres magnifique!!!  Truly a wonderful restaurant - excellent food, impeccable service, and very dog friendly."}
{"text":"I ate here for free for a CE dinner, so my review is slightly biased since it's already getting at least 3 stars for the pure fact that it was free.  I loves me some free food.    The first course I had the Red pepper soup, with truffle oil, and mushroom powder.  I've been obsessed with soup lately and it was really good,  had a lovely smoothness to it.  It's heavy, but it's winter (well the closest thing to winter) here so it was appropriate for the season.     I had the hangar steak and gruyere mash with a red wine sauce.  I think the first two bites the steak and sauce to be a bit salty.  Prob 80 percent of people would think it was fine, I'm very sensitive to salt.   I was surprised though that no one asked me how I wanted my steak cooked, typically a hangar steak is rare, medium rare. but still I'd like a choice it's America after all!  The mash had a great taste, but I'd enjoy it more if it was a bit more dense,  It sorta just laid there in the plate and was only a touch more thick than baby food.  I was a little disappointed with the presentation of the plate.  It sorta just laid there,  no  rhyme or reason and as I looked around at other plates there wasn't much consistency with plating.  It's a cool looking restaurant and with the price point I'd expect a little care to the plating.   For desert I had the tower of chocolate mousse which was very good. I love chocolate mousse and the berries on top were ripe and sweet.    The joint  has really cool interiors, great lighting ( i love good lighting), neato bathroom sink, and great service.   I think cause it was free I give it four stars, but if I would of paid  I'd give it 3 stars. I'd probably be satisfied and considered it a good meal but not dying to come back.  yay for free dinners ."}
{"text":"The restaurant is great. The food is beautifully arranged and delicious. I am very happy with the waiter, very professional and made me feel very comfortable and happy with his/her dinner. Six courses was fantastic ."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try the petits plates , they were not petits plates but tout petits plates , they were vraiment miniscule !! We had the charcuterie plate , one slice of cheese and saucisson sliced so thin it was transparent ! We also had the smoked salmon spoons ,very pretty presentation ,but there was so little smoked salmon we could not even taste it . Service was ok but no one ever came to ask us if everything was ok . Tres decevant !!! We were there on Sunday night and sat at the bar . We wanted to taste other items on the petites plates menu but based on what we ordered we decided it would be more of the same . We left disappointed and hungry . Quel dommage .!"}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant due to the proximity to my hotel and the splendid reviews on Yelp.  I was not disappointed.    The atmosphere here was nice. Light mood music was playing and the décor was elegant.  There was a large bar surrounding the kitchen area, but I opted to sit at one of the tables.  I started off with the duck confit salad.  I wanted the roasted beet salad after spotting it on the menu listed on Open Table, but unfortunately, it was discontinued.  My substitute duck confit salad was pretty amazing, however.  The duck had a nice crispy skin on the outside and the inside was moist and tender.  They paired well with the cherries in the salad and there were ample amounts of the duck and cherries to go with the greens and fennel, however.  For my entrée, I opted for the grilled salmon with roasted vegetables (I had cauliflower).  The execution was spot on, although it was a little boring.  The salmon was nice and crispy on the outside and very moist, but cooked, in the middle.  I would have preferred a little more acidity in the dish, but there was a touch of acidity provided by the diced tomatoes topping the fish.  The chocolate mousse tower was absolutely brilliant.  There was a white chocolate/dark chocolate exterior shell encompassing a chocolate mousse interior that had some strawberries in the top of the tower.  Molten white chocolate was poured over the tower for a neat effect.  The dessert tasted great and the mousse had a wonderful consistency.  The only weakness was my server Jose.  He was lackadaisical and was more interested in chatting it up with the people around me except me.  If he had been just a little engaged, I would have given this place a five star review.  Too bad since it would have been nice to give five stars for my 100th review."}
{"text":"From the time you enter till the time you depart, Christopher's exudes a comfortable luxury. Sleek elegant lighting casts upon gorgeous wood and glass surfaces accented with pops of orange and brown. Deep overstuffed chairs that cradle and beckon you to stay a while longer. These elements combined with a James Beard award winning chef sets the stage for romance and sophistication.  Chef-owner Christopher Gross' latest restaurant is located in the updated Biltmore Fashion Park adjacent to Sak's Fifth Avenue. Main parking can be intolerable and downright frustrating, though if you enter towards the back, there is plenty of good parking in the structure.   Beyond the warm greeting from the hosts, there are 2 distinct spaces in the restaurant; one side is Christopher's and the other Crush lounge. At Crush, have a seat in one of the cushy banquettes and enjoy a menu of small plates, pizzas and wine. On the other side, Christopher's is the more formal dining space and while sophisticated is by no means stuffy.   Christopher's menu is mostly French inspired, though I think of it as well traveled with hints of Italian and Asian. Chef Gross' worldliness comes from positions in Paris, London and Normandy. With so much expertise, it's no wonder he has been awarded so many accolades, including afore mentioned James Beard award for Best Chef Southwest.  Ordering up some \"First Plates\" to share, Alsatian onion tart, ($14) a rectangle of flaky puff pastry adorned with sweet caramelized onions, bacon and a salad of frisée dressed with pungent vinaigrette will awaken your palette. I could have easily eaten the whole thing rather than just a few bites.   Creamy Terrine of Hudson Valley Foie Gras ($24) was neatly placed along side a brandied date tart, points of toasted brioche and a drizzle of Pedro Ximénez wine reduction. This was slow eating at its finest as I built each component onto the end of my fork.   A salad composed with delightfully salty Duck Confit ($16) mixed greens, Humboldt Fog cheese and Cognac infused cherries was a triumph. But the Butter Poached Lobster ($18) with fresh greens, pine nuts and roasted fennel vinaigrette was better and now my new favorite.   How about a few suggestions for your main course? Definitely the smoked truffle infused Filet Mignon ($36), tender, earthy and ambrosial. We also enjoyed the 12 oz. New York Steak ($34), cast iron seared and pepper-crusted. Heightened with cracked pepper, the beef flavor was piquant and juicy.  Consider a few sides too, such as the Mac n'Cheese Au Gratin ($7) with velvety cream sauce spiked with ham or the additively smooth Gruyère Pommes Purée ($7). And maybe a vegetable, the Brussels Sprouts ($7) were a special that night, deliciously bitter and sweet.  While the fare was delightful and service professional, each course became more strained as the night wore on with our waiter disappearing for long periods of time. Finally having to ask for the check, we decided to skip the sweets, there simply wasn't room.  Chef Gross has it going on here, fantastic food, a great wine list and most of all my new favorite date spot."}
{"text":"Sometimes I like to treat myself to a classy lunch...ALONE.  This is my favorite place to do so!! $20 lunch special gets three courses; I had the red pepper soup, grilled veggie sandwich and the chocolate tower.   Once again, I'm thrilled by the top notch service, impeccable food, and wonderful atmosphere. I'm writing this review as I sit at the kitchen bar, watching chefs and sous chefs bustle around...it's like Christmas. I also like hearing the communication around the kitchen. These guys are making sure the duck salad is plated last so everyone's lunches are fresh and quality. There's something to be said for professionalism and passion, and these chefs demonstrate both.   Do yourself a favor and come eat here. Happy hour is the best around and you won't be disappointed. Promise."}
{"text":"Went here for the wife's birthday... you'd think at a high-end place they would at least offer a free desert... nope!  Overall the food good but for the price is did not impress at all. There were a few small exceptions. I explain below the entire meal.  I'd go here if someone else was paying but for the $170 (including tip) for 2 people with a half bottle ($20) wine I have had MUCH better food and better experience and many other places.  My Suggestion - Spend your high-end $ else where unless you are very wealthy and can drop $170 on dinner like most people would drop $10 on lunch.  Wild Mushroom Soup (sans foie gras) was excellent... worth $10, no but very very tasty.  Duck Two Ways was good, not great. If it had more veggie or a starch with it the $28 would have been a decent deal - but it lacked those so still a bit over priced.  Prix Fixe menu was smoked salmon starter, escolar (one of my favs), veal cheeks, two cheeses, and desert... for $75. For the amount of food it really should be about $55, tops. It was good, not great, let me explain...  Smoked Salmon was excellent... really very, very good... but it was a mere sliver like a sliver of prosciutto.  Escolar (my favorite white fish) was so-so. It was cooked maybe a bit too much and the sauce was did nothign for the fish except maybe cover the delecate, sweet flavor up... or the over cooking or maybe it was not a good cut of the escolar - could not tell.  Veal Cheeks stood out as very good... though the sauce was too thick/heavy and masked much of the natural veal flavor... hint for those that want to get Veal Cheeks here... get the sauce on the side!  Cheeses were excellent, good portion too - no complaints.  Desert was the Gateau Marjolaine - EXCELLENT. Just get it!"}
{"text":"There is never a time the food isn't superb. I feel this restaurant is one of the few gems we have in Phoenix, worthy of the drive every single time. The small plates are always a winner and the tasting menus are a sexy, slow exploration in self-indulgence. The chef is often there and is as approachable and charming as the cuisine. You won't be disappointed and will come back feeling like family."}
{"text":"Still my favorite happy hour spot. Half priced wines -- a HUGE selection of quality wines from which to choose -- and gourmet quality food.   While not on the happy hour menu specifically, the mac n cheese remains a deal. It's cheesy but not gooey. The spiral noodles are perfectly cooked. You'll find plenty of pieces of thinly sliced ham.   The flat breads and burgers are standbys. And, these are among the only sweet potato fries I will eat -- generally, I hate sweet potatoes but the seasoning and texture of these fries is doable. ;)  Save me a seat at the bar!"}
{"text":"We enjoy it for a different reason each time we go but the food is always a hit."}
{"text":"Let me just say, I tried Christopher's only for the french desserts, so this review will not be of assistance to you if you are looking for takes on the Foie gras or the rib-eye.  The atmosphere is relaxed and chic, very much elegant and yet not super over the top. You enjoy it! Our server was friendly and assisted us with the extensive wine and drinks list!  My friend and I both had wine. Great menu from reds to bubbly to whites and dessert wines.  The desserts: I tried the Gateau Marjolaine and it was really great. Quite similar to a chocolate mousse cake I had previously enjoyed, but nonetheless, very enjoyable. My friend had the Soufflé au chocolat and that was a real tea too and the chocolate sauce did not overpower the softness of the rise. The design was splendid, creating an all around sweet experience!  Would love to come back for more dessert and wine, and perhaps try some of the items on the food menu next time as well!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for happy hour with a friend. Honestly had never heard of it til she mentioned it. Glad she did :) Happy hour is from 3-6pm, and my my is it yummy. It's a modern place that's welcoming. We sat at the bar and got the goat cheese and garlic pizza. Yum! and major fan of the crust. Perfect mix of soft and crunch. Also got the salmon salad. Salmon tasted great and salad was coated with the right amount of dressing. Good wine and free bread/butter made for a great happy hour that wasn't too expensive either! Yay! Def looking forward to going back and trying some more"}
{"text":"Just writing reconfirm the excellence of the waitstaff and menu.  The menu is varied enough to encompass diners not as familiar with traditional French cuisine but does not stray too far from the path for traditionalists.  This is one of the few restaurants where the named Chef is in nearly every night ensuring quality control and consistency.  Chef Gross cares deeply about his suppliers and the training of staff.  The attention to detail shows.  For those in need of a private party, the restaurant works with you to craft the menu and personalize the event so that your guests are left wowed by the experience.  I do not hesitate to bring my most discerning of business guests here.  For less formal needs the bar area is cozy and perfect for a get together with close friends."}
{"text":"May be the best restaurant in the Biltmore shopping area.  Had dinner at the bar with a friend and loved the whole experience, from the service to the food.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend! Loved it! We came because it was one of the only places that had a hanger steak in town. All around everything was fantastic. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"This is the Macho Man Randy Savage!  Welcome to Christopher's Restaurant\CRrrrrrrush Lounge!  Oh Yeah! (To the late Macho Man Randy Savage!)  Christopher's Restaurant is actually far from the WWE.  I would say it has a lot more class and realism to it.  Located inside the Biltmore Fashion Park, Christopher's Restaurant/Crush Lounge place is a hidden gem!  The restaurant itself is split into two areas, the restaurant and a lounge.    The restaurant area is very hip with a contemporary feel.  It has an open kitchen where renowned Chef Christopher Gross and his sous chefs create his master pieces in front of patrons.  Yes, it is a delight to see an artist at work!  I definitely recommend sitting at the restaurant bar once to meet all the chefs.    Crush lounge is the other half.  It's sexy and sleek.  Feel a bit naughty?  I hope I'm not the only after a visited to this bar!  The portraits on posted in front of the bar is very \"mature audience\" oriented.  If you can't handle the heat go to the restaurant; a lot more PG-13 on that end.  Crush lounge is an intimate area where you can enjoy your drinks and order some small bites.  The Crush lounge offers up cheese platters, pizzas, and some of your favorites from burgers to calamari.    The food from the restaurant half is a nothing less than great!  If your palate doesn't say wow then have checked out.  Might need an MRI and put on injure reserved list!  Chef Christopher offers everything from your basic burgers and pizza to fine dining cuisines like Foie Gra and Duck Confit!  Trust me you're losing out on anything if you order here.  Matter of fact you'll probably come back to try the rest! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place was on my bookmark for a long time and after I heard they are closing this location at the end of this month to relocate to the Wiggly Mansion, I wanted to try here before then.  The chef is known for foie gras. I ordered 3oz of it for my appetizer. It was so rich and creamy in texture, loved every bite of it. Nicely presented, 3 oz may seem small but since it is so rich, portion was perfect. If I were younger, my body might have been able to accept more as they have larger portion size available.   For my main, I had rack of lamb. I really like lamb anywhere and I tend to order one whenever I see one on the menu. I knew I wanted to try here too and was glad I did.   When I tasted butter served with complimentary bread, I knew their dessert was going to be good. Their butter tasted like grass-fed. I didn't ask to be sure but I really liked their butter. I was right about dessert. Be sure to leave some room for dessert as they were good. Perfect way to end perfect meal.  I really loved how each dish was presented. It was so pretty, it was like an art.   Excellent service made it cherry on top to my visit here. Server said they are open until 1/27, then reopen at the new location on 2/1. I hope I can try their food again either here or at their new location."}
{"text":"Another addition to \"Pissed at myself for not trying sooner\". I think I had't been to Christopher's sooner because of it's location. I'm usually at the Biltmore shopping and spending too much money at the Apple Store. So I usually walk on by to head home play with my new toy(s).  So I finally made a conscious effort to go and I was pretty sure upon walking in that I would regret not coming sooner. I had a few drinks at Crush lounge and though tiny, it fit the bill for an actual lounge. So many places call themselves lounges when they're just a bar trying to glorify themselves.  Crush is a true lounge-a small scale version of what you might find at a boutique hotel:intimate, dimly lit, good music and private spaces to enjoy a cocktail with someone special. I have to make it an effort to come here for cocktails more often because the vibe here is usually what I'm looking for-mental note made.  After drinks we took a seat at the Kitchen Bar, where it was awesome to watch Christopher and his team at working creating culinary works of art. I went on a Monday where I was able to take advantage of one of their specials: grilled tenderloin with au gratin potatoes for $20. SCORE!!!!! It was served sliced up and served with a Cabernet reduction which was delicious. I also got to try some mushroom and arugula pizza which was served on such heavenly crust. Everything was c'est magnifique!  I really have to applaud them as well for a top notch wine list. I LOVE South African wine and there are very few places in the U.S. that  feature on their wine list. So as if I wasn't happy enough with my meal and the experience this little extra plus is what earned them five stars in my book.  This is a very nice place and I can't wait to bring my family here. I'm sure a lot of folks may overlook this place if they're busy shopping. If nothing else, stop in for lunch and see why you need ot make it back for dinner."}
{"text":"The owner of Christopher's even after all the success and publicity still nods his head to me when I say hi. I am a nobody but I am a nobody who has met him many times and has spent more then a few dollars at his restaurant. I say this because I think his restaurant deserves more credit in how perfect the food is executed and also the sleek design of the restaurant.  The food is excellent and we always are wow'd by the taste of our dishes.   It is expensive but oh so good. We come from chandler. The food is that good. Usually the service is also top notch.   I'm giving out kudos to The manager Jennifer Kyle. She deserves the 5th star.  Thank you for being spot on and representing a great restaurant as it should be represented.    Food: The raspberry cream egg, tarte de tart, duck two ways, Foie gras, Mac and cheese, risotto and house made bread are our favorites.  But I've never had a bad dish here. (And one of us on this night happens to be French, knows good French food and best of all wants to come back even after a hiccup. So two !!)"}
{"text":"Always have an incredible dining experience her with my wife. We come and build our own tasting menu based off there small plates we order 8-10 and always get a great pastry at the end. Beverage wis very smart wine list and a cocktail program that includes one of my favorites the corpse reviver. Besides the food and beverage the service is always on point well timed and extremely knowledgeable of all dishes. Hands down one of our favorite spots in the area to eat. Keep up the great food!!"}
{"text":"We went at 7 pm the Sat night of President's Day Weekend (and Valentine's Day next day) so the crowd was probably stronger than usual.  The food is very good- most dishes a 7-9 out of 10.  However, I felt like we were at a TGIF the service was so unprofessional and painful.  It took 2 hours and 10 minutes (you know it's a bad experience when you are looking at your watch) for our entrees to arrive!!  We had 2 pre-teen kids and had a party of 8 total. Our waiter had NO personality and ignored us the first 10 min after we were seated -- I knew then we were in for a very long meal!  We had to flag him down to order cocktails, then flag him down to ask  what the specials and soup/fish of day were.  He was SUCH a bad and inefficient waiter- bringing out some appetizers, but not others, rushing around and looking frantic, and then bringing 2-3 entrees at a time and making one person at our table wait about 10 min for the final entree (that fish of the day) arrive.   My mild mannered husband asked for the manager and he Never does that.  The Maitre de came and apologized for huge delay claiming kitchen was short staffed- and comped us some desserts.   It's a shame-- this could be an over the top great place- but they need to better staff the kitchen and get rid of the waiters better suited for a Bennigsns.  When you spend $800 plus for dinner for your group-- you want much better service!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant for the first time on Valentine's Day. There was a prix fixe menu with multiple great, flavorful options. The unique combination of flavors was well-crafted and tasteful. I would give the food high marks. However, the restaurant and service were mediocre, and for the amount that was paid, I felt the return was minimal. The place was clean and trendy but lacked memorable features. There was some decoration for Valentine's Day, but its  location in the mall gives the place a limited view, and the ambiance felt weird.  The tables were a little too close to one another so I felt as if I was sitting in on someone else's date! The service was also mediocre. Our server was very nice and the staff was very prompt in turning over our table for the next course. I judge a server by interaction, and there was very minimal personality or interaction for that matter. If you're looking strictly for good food at a high price, I would recommend this place but if you're looking for a restaurant with high marks across the board, I would advise you to save your money and go elsewhere, especially since there are many other restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"2 stars.... I would have rated it higher, but as always... service either makes it or breaks it.  It was restaurant week in Arizona so my friends and I decided to try something new. First stop for the restaurant weekend was Christopher's and Crush Lounge.  Chic, elegant, and upscale were my first thoughts when I walked in. The tables were romantically lit (my other way of saying that it needs a little more light).  We were given bread while we decided what to order and everything was going well.. so far...  Then came Jose, our server. Since we are not usually offered a menu with the words Merguez, Boudin Noir de Schrieners, Vennoise and Gateau Marjolaine we decided to ask for recommendations. Our dear server simply said \"all of them\". Great! Now that helped a lot. We did ask for more details and even asked what each entree was. Jose did explain. It was chicken, steak, sausage and chocolate. Hmmm... very appetizing. After we rolled the dice on what we would get from the menu, Jose cleaned up the extra table and extra plate beside my seat. He then rolled a piece of bread sitting on the extra table to my plate. He then smiled and said \"woohoo, extra!\". Again, WOW for an elegant and chic restaurant.  The service was way below my expectation. Since my table is paying $300 for our meal, we at least deserve some good service. Not great, just good. Just the right type of dinner table service.   Oh the food... it was original. It had so much flavor. Plating was pretty. Steak was great! Much as I want to talk about the good food and the FABULOUS dessert, I think I'm already at my word count quota while reviewing the BAD service. SAD! =(  more reviews on  http://themealexperience.blogspot.com/"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Have been coming to Christopher's for years and years. Every menu item is prepared perfectly every time. Daily specials are always fresh and excellent. Wine list, especially by the  glass is extensive. Sampling menus are always on par. And they treat kids extra special.  Christopher is usually present at night at the open kitchen. The waitstaff is excellent. This is absolutely one of our top three \"go to places\" in Phoenix. And if you're thinking of going to some average place for burgers or pizza, their ground Burger is one of the best I've ever had. Their daily pizza specials are brick oven bake and are better than anyone else's except for maybe Bianco. And the prices are the same or less than having a burger at Zinburger, not 100 yards away."}
{"text":"Wow! Being a Phoenix native, we have enjoyed many a meals at the hands of Chef Gross. But this past weekend I was blown away.  I was planning a large garden party for my friends bridal shower. The record temperatures left my garden ravaged by the heat and I did not want to have sweltering ladies unable to enjoy themselves. After a small response to attendance, I decided to see what some of my favorite dining spots could offer me.  I had a small budget but wanted to keep it classy. Christopher's truly rose to the occasion. Alex, was my special event contact and this lady was \"on it\". Emails and phone calls were returned at lightning speed. She presented a delightful menu with plenty of choices (some even for the vegetarians attending) all with in my price range.   We had a wonderful time. We had a party of 18 in the beautiful private room that fit our festivities perfectly. Sundays can be quiet at The Biltmore Fashion Park so it lend-ed us to a bit of intimacy that was nice. Ben was our go to guy. He was right there for every thing we needed and his helpers were polite and attentive. As for the food, well, it's Chris, come on! I had the vegetable risotto ans  it was cooked to perfection. All of the plates came out of the kitchen quickly and all together but no one ever made us feel rushed. Wine flowed, desserts were gobbled up and the ladies oohed and awed over everything. the staff even offered to take gifts to the car for the bride.  Thanks for saving me Chef Chris and your team. You were all fabulous and I will be telling all of my friends what a great job you did. The holidays are coming and Ben reminded us that they also do catering! Hmmm, can you say \"Christmas Party\"?"}
{"text":"Came here for HH.  Sat at counter area by the open kitchen.  I ordered the cheeseburger and comes with mixed sweet potato & truffle fries.  Then I added petite crispy raviolis.  Everything was so so good and flavorful.  The service was fantastic.  And sitting at the open kitchen, it was neat to see the other dishes and seeing the chefs prep for a large party."}
{"text":"Im torn. Love the decor of crush, well the sofas, art, bar, etc. Ceiling looks like the deck of an old boat with a horrid bright yellow mesh chandelier.The ceiling and the chandelier dont even come close to matching the swankiness of the rest of the place. This is a decorator fail.  As for their Happy Hour, the items they offer as far as drinks go are pretty standard. 50% off house wines, well drinks, beer, etc.. I had 2 dirty martinis and I paid $15?? How is that a HH special or should I ask how much are their dirty martini's normally? I was charged the HH price for the vodka but then an upcharge for a martini?? Thats' just ridiculous.  I didnt order any food but I did sample my friend's cheese assortment with crostini and it was sinfully good. I would definitely return to try the food and I would recommend the bar, they do make a mean dirty martini, however I would not send someone there under the illusion of great HH prices."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful experience here. We stopped in before a show to have an early dinner. We sat at the bar and tried a bunch of items of their tasting menu. The foie gras was deliciously rich and paired perfectly with the wonderful bread they served. Christopher suggested the steak au poivre and it was cooked perfectly medium rare with a great crust, the sauce complimented it nicely. This was probably my favorite dish we had. The  escargot  was delicious and the addition of the puff pastry on top was an great decision. The blood sausage was as good as any I've had and the puff pastry was astounding. The star of the meal for my wife was the dessert. She got the  mousse tower and absolutely loved it.   Overall we had a great dining experience and will definitely be going back. We suggest you get a seat at the bar because watching them prepare these great meals is a time."}
{"text":"Over the years I have had good and bad meals and service at Christopher's.  My last outing there was so bad in fact I didn't return for a year.  I was thrilled with both my service and food on my last visit.  I used this place as one of a handful of venues to host guests from out of town.  I am so happy that they are back to the great food and service that made them a Biltmore staple in the first place.  I would gladly have given them 5 stars on my last visit.  Its great to see a landmark restaurant continue in its traditions of great food, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here with the Better Half to celebrate her Birthday.  The restaurant came highly recommended by a friend, and we noticed that they had Foie Gras on the menu (her fave) so we decided to check it out.    We reviewed the menu before we got to the restaurant and decided to order:  Roasted Foie Gras Prepared Sous Vide - $110  Smoked Truffle-Infused Filet Mignon - $38  For sides - $8 each:  Mac n' Cheese au Gratin w/ Ham Gnocchi Potatoes Au Gratin  The server took the order and came back a few minutes later to tell us that they're out of Foie Gras.  We were extremely disappointed and surprised....especially since there were 3 items on the menu that had Foie Gras as the main ingredient and the place wasn't packed.    In an attempt to save the day, the server checked with the kitchen and came back and said there was a small piece of Foie Gras left for the Appetizer but that he could prepare it like the entree.  Since we came all the way down here for the dish, we agreed.  While we were waiting for our dinner, our Bread and Water was never refilled and we had to pour our own Wine.  For a restaurant like this, we didn't expect that kind of service.  The food arrived...the Filet was decent, but not great.  Not as tender as I usually like it.  The highlight was the Gnocchi.  The Better Half said her Foie Gras tasted a little funny.  She didn't finish her serving.  Overall, the experience was sub-par.  The server's attempt to save the day kept us from giving this place 1 Star.  Return Factor - 5%"}
{"text":"Warm, friendly, delightful service always, and the food and drinks are fantastic! A special thanks to Doug for making today a great experience! Try the Crush Violette for a lovely, light champagne treat."}
{"text":"Incredible. The service is great, the food is great. We had the chicken and the mussels after the escargot, which was covered in a puff pastry and was awesome! The risotto was equally impressive. A little slow for a Saturday night but that only increased the incredible service! This is a must do while in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Cool Vibe at this place. It was our first visit to Christopher's, we have heard quite a bit about it.  We meet friends for a quick drink and appetizer.  The staff was very attentive, although our drinks took awhile.  We order the wild mushroom, arugula pizza.....which was absolutely delicious and only 16 bucks.  They have a wonderful wine menu, but beers on tap is limited to two.  We would return for the pizza alone."}
{"text":"Went to Christopher's for lunch today with my family.  Service was excellent, we didn't need to struggle to catch anyone's attention, and I felt a bit bad because a 20% tip didn't seem enough for the multiple servers that waited on us given the low prices.   Three of us ordered the express lunch: a starter of soup or salad, choice of protein meal (there is a veggie option), and choice of desert. I don't know how they can serve so much for $20. The portions were larger than I expected, and the meat was succulent. Mom loved the soup -- it was very rich and not greasy. My starter was the arugula salad, which was delicious with the right amount of dressing, The chicken was cooked just the right amount, juicy, served with the skin. We also ordered the Grill Salad, which had excellent cuts of meat and was substantial, for only $16. The only quibble I had was that the penne pasta in the express lunch was drenched in too much rich pesto sauce for my preference. The pasta wasn't overcooked. The deserts were incredible creations and perhaps a bit too large.   I plan on going back next time I'm in Phoenix to try their dinner menu. We had a wonderful experience. This restaurant deserves to be packed."}
{"text":"Three of us had lunch at Christopher's yesterday.  We all said it was the best meal we had during our 3 month stay in Arizona.  One person had the foie gras appetizer and the seafood of the day.  Two people had  the $20 three course lunch.  We both ordered the lobster bisque,  and penne pasta with seafood.  For desert, we had  a lemon tart and the chocolate mouse tower.  All of the food was very well prepared and full of flavor.  The chocolate mousse tower looked and tasted amazing.  Our waiter did an excellent job.  He explained the dishes as he served them.  He was very attentive and timed things well."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar- counter Friday evening and greatly enjoyed the 'food preparation' going on in front of us.  Our server was very attentive and our scallops and chocolate tower were delicious."}
{"text":"Very nice place a little hard to find but be sure to seek out.  Food presentation and service was excellent.  Wide ranging choices  of French specialties.  Small plates are great way to sample as I could not choose only one."}
{"text":"Try the seasonal tasting menu with the wine pairing.  The roasted duck with Sherry reduction is to die for. Props to the chef."}
{"text":"OK yelpers here goes..... I AM IN LOVE WITH CHRISTOPHERS! Delish~!   I usually only eat at the high end froofy restaurants a couple times a year. 1 because prices are high and 2 the servings usually small and let us not forget the Ala cart menu's. Lets face it up scale dining has come to sauces as a side dish. Never the less I like to be adventurous and splurge now and then!   I really like the decor the ginormous front door is cool and it opens to a very elegant, hip and trendy kind of suave atmosphere. I'm diggin the kitchen in the middle of the restaurant too. The funky board listing the specials and the almost unisex bathroom. Be careful here that you choose the correct side. The sink is fun except when you reach under the trickles of water and find yourself bumping your hand against someone on the other side. Yeah it happened to me :P   I started with the Jasmin blackberry infused green tea. Yum! Mind you it is lunchtime so no liquor for me thanks. Although I maybe could have used just a sip or two today. I chose the butter poached lobster, arugula, pine nut and roasted fennel vinaigrette salad. WOW that was tasty and large enough to split with a friend so I did.  For the main course I selected the Smoked truffle infused filet Mignon! OH YEAH MOMMY LIKES~! OMG I know it is over used but OMG! This steak was so delectable I wanted another for desert. Is that wrong? It comes with your choice of 3 sauces to compliment it. I think a Bearnaise, I know a red wine reduction or a brandy peppercorn. I chose the brandy peppercorn, but this steak was so outstanding I didn't want to ruin it with my fork. Let alone a sauce. Do I ordered it on the side. I did try the sauce and it was heaven. So I used it to dip my veggie mix in. Heck ya I'm a little silly like that.   Lets just say if this was a meal eaten at home the plate would have been licked clean! By far hands down the best filet I have eaten to date. I am from the Midwest and we ate steak at least once a week. This steak was amazing, delectable, outstanding, stupendous and did I say good?   The service was spot on! Our server knew everything about the menu and described everything in great detail! Bravo!  Go now and eat it! Christopher I could kiss you! You get 10 steak knives up for that meal.  THANKS, your latest groupie~  PS. Diners leave your kids at home, this is no place for them ever! Go hire a sitter, if you can afford to eat here you can afford to pay someone to watch your screaming child so I don't have to. Cheesecake factory is around the corner and they love your kids. :)"}
{"text":"Love their food. Everything is amazing on their menu! Love the location and the restaurant is quiet. Service is fast!"}
{"text":"Wish this review could be about the food but I never had the chance to try it.   Came here yesterday for lunch with a couple coworkers and after we were sat none of the servers ever came to the table,  not even for a drink order.    After more than 20 minutes of us sitting their with our waters I saw a waiter drop something off near a table and said very politely excuse sir but we haven't seen our server and we have been here a while.    He said rudely that someone would be with us in a few minutes.   At that point we just got up and left.   No point in giving a place your business if they don't want it."}
{"text":"Worse new years dinner ever!!! Portions were so small for a $250 dinner for 2 people!!! 1 scallop for a course along with a \"rack\" of lamb which only contain 2 pieces of meat and bone!!! And on top of it we were not dressed fancy the waiter made us feel like we have no money to eat there. No Business of Being There!!! Made us feel like we don't  belong there and ruined our baby 1st birthday and New Years Eve dinner!!! discrimination should not happen. I will never be back!!!!!! This is not the first time that we came there but it will definitely will be the LAST!!!! We aren't afraid to say that we left No Tip because of him!!!!"}
{"text":"Exceptional restaurant. Good vibe, delectable food, and ultra personal/friendly staff. Christopher's feels life changing, every time."}
{"text":"I did one semester at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, NY. I was young and not interested in the classic French style of culinary training. That part where they scream and yell like you are in a scene from Full Metal Jacket.  This place is the real deal in French/American cooking. There is a champagne bottle signed by Paul Bocuse in the wine case. To consistently execute at this level and be in business for as long as they have is a testament to the skill and passion that was demanded in the French kitchens of culinary legends.  I believe that if Chef Christopher Gross was to visit the CIA at some point they would take him down to the Hudson River and demand he walk on the water. Yeah it's that good."}
{"text":"The scallops were the perfect dish for my pregnant wife.  We had a delightful night out that didn't break the bank.  Do a search for coupons and deals online before your visit.  The service was fabulous and very helpful."}
{"text":"Every once in awhile you get to have a dining experience that leaves you feeling special in the end.  If you have dinner here at Christopher's and Crush Lounge, you will leave with that feeling.  Upon entering the restaurant, you automatically get the sense that every detail of this place has been given proper attention.  The decor is modern yet open and warm feeling, the hostess is friendly, and the waiters move around like a perfect symphony of service.  Our waiter, Thomas, was an absolute rock star.  He was attentive, gave great recommendations, and you can tell that he really believes and loves the quality of the food.  I would 100% sit in his section again; he was that good.  And then there's the food....oh lordy is the food fantastic!  Again, the attention to detail in the flavor and presentation was outstanding.  We went for restaurant week, and I must say that our favorite bites came from the french onion soup (I'm going back for this next week), the diver scallops (had beautiful sear and was so buttery and light in flavor), and the filet mignon (cooked perfectly and was utter perfection).    I absolutely loved the entire dining experience at Christopher's and I plan on taking a bigger group with me next time to enjoy this special experience.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in a while.  The atmosphere is really cool, they have an open kitchen and you can sit right at the counter around it and watch them make your food.  You can imagine that with that kind of pressure they're gonna be working harder to make sure it's good!  They didn't disappoint.  I ordered the Smoked Truffle-Infused Filet Mignon and was so happy I did!  It was actually cooked correctly (medium rare) and came with a delicious red wine sauce that complemented it perfectly.  For dessert I couldn't decide between two of them so I ordered both!  Total splurge but it was worth it.  I got the cheesecake and the Gateau Marjolaine.  The cheesecake was honestly one of, if not the best cheescakes I've ever had.  The flavor and texture were exquisite and it was simply topped with some sliced almonds.  The Gateau Marjolaine was good, but nothing compared to that cheesecake.  I was impressed with the service as well.  I had a dedicated server who took my orders and checked on me but that didn't stop the other servers and bussers from checking on me as well which I love.  If I was finished with something then whoever noticed first took care of it and cleared it for me.  Same with refilling my water so it was just a great experience from start to finish in all aspects."}
{"text":"This is not my locale here and coming to the Biltmore Fashion Square is kinda hectic.  But this is a quaint spot to pop in for appetizers and drinks.  They have a variety of flatbreads, sandwiches, and other traditional fare that are delicious.  Happy hour offers deals on food , wine, etc. So if you are in the area and want a quick drink , stop on in."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and drinks with a huge party of girls. We went on a Saturday night and the place did not seem very busy at all. The lighting was perfect for a lounge atmosphere and we did end up sitting in the lounge area. I didn't find the seating in the lounge too comfortable since the seats were really low, but I did like the decor. I ended up getting a few cocktails and their Mixed Pomme Frittes - yam and regular french fries - which I definitely recommend! Most of the cocktails were $12. I tried the Pear Martini which was pretty strong, but the best cocktail I tried. Also, had the Strawberry Guavatini which was just okay.   Overall, the service was just average. The server checked on us regularly but nothing really amazing. It took longer than it should have (I think) to get my pomme frittes considering I was one of the first to order. We WERE a pretty big party, but the server made it more difficult then it needed to be to separate checks.   This would be a great place to have a dinner date or come with a smaller group, but definitely not recommended for bigger parties. Be prepared to spend $$ because the menu is pretty pricey!"}
{"text":"to be frank, i was disappointed by christopher's. i was staying at the camby across the street, and thought it would be great to eat somewhere in the mall and do some shopping before turning in for the evening.  this was during restaurant week, so it's understandable that the place was hopping and everyone was on edge and swamped. i was dining alone, so they seated me right in front of the open kitchen where the chef was expediting that evening. i wasnt feeling super hungry, so i passed on the restaurant week menu - but the 3 course menu for $44 seems like a steal and im sure most everyone at the place went for it. they also did wine pairings for $20, which is also great. i perused the regular menu and went for the mushroom soup with foie gras and the truffle fries - cuz well, DUH. i rarely pass on foie gras when it's on the menu.  they brought out the soup first - seared foie at the center of the bowl, and soup poured around it - good presentation from the chef himself. however, the mushroom had little mushroom flavor - all i really tasted was olive oil.  idk what happened here... there were little morsels of mushies inside, but overall lacking and much too oily - especially for a hot evening. the foie gras as seared nicely - and i ate it with the bread they serve. overall - very underwhelming. they brought me the truffle fries as a second course, which i thought was an interesting move. i probably would've liked them together, but they didnt ask and i didnt clarify.  for drinks - i ordered the penincillin, served on the rocks, which was billed as a chef favorite on the cocktail menu.  it tasted quite sugary and a little watered down - there were a LOT of rocks in my drinks... idk about this.  the best part of dinner was definitely talking to chef gross, who is super sweet and courteous (and offered me free dessert)!  we talked about eating around the world and he seems super down to earth. i would give christopher's another try on a non-restaurant week evening because the chef was so nice.  i think the remaining service professionals here may need a little bit more training..."}
{"text":"Food is SUPERB....had  a birthday lunch today(10/5/16),,,BEST lunch anywhere in Scottsdale...the chicken penne pasta  is the best I ever tasted(pesto sauce is to die for and the chicken is cooked to perfection)...the lobster salad is phenominal...the desserts are like being in heaven..do NOT miss a chance to dine here"}
{"text":"Christopher's and Crush Lounge 2502 E Camelback Rd. Suite #102  Phoenix, AZ 85016  As part of Phoenix Restaurant Week 2016, this restaurant was one of several chosen to be reviewed. Companion and I arrived at 5:30 with reservations and were immediately seated. During this week, participating restaurants serve a prix fixe menu, and those who don't get to eat in some of the more pricey venues get to enjoy them at lower prices.  Our waiter was immediately at our table and introduced himself. I explained that we were there to try the special menu and we were handed both the special menu as well as the regular menu and the rather large spirit list.   We started with cocktails - myself with a Beefeater extra dry martini with a double olive and companion with a pink squirrel. We were a bit surprised at being told that the bar did not have all the ingredients for the pink squirrel, and that it also did not have a blender. Yet, by doing some judicious substituting and some excellent shaking, they were able to come up with a very close substitute for the pink squirrel.  Next, we ordered appetizers. Companion had a large diver scallop, properly seared and perfectly cooked and served with tiny ravioli's in an excellent sauce. I ordered the cassolette of mushrooms with port sauce. This was a mélange of wild mushrooms including a very young king mushroom in an almost sweet port sauce that was anything but overwhelming and allowed the essence of the mushrooms to come through. I appreciated that the mushrooms were not overcooked and still had good texture.  For the main courses, companion had a very tender petite fillet served over gratin potatoes that had just enough cheese to give flavor without overwhelming the potato. It was interesting that the potatoes were sliced paper thin, were properly cooked, yet still had texture. My main course was the breast of duck with sherry sauce. Duck should be cooked rare or medium rare, and I was not disappointed. The sauce was excellent as was the bed of baby asparagus the duck was served on. A nugget of roasted garlic provided a perfect counterpoint to some of the flavors.  Christopher's is noted for some of its desserts, and we were not disappointed. Companion had a lemon tarte with berry sauce. The plate also had the base of a tuile covered in a lemon/lime foam that was outstanding and easily cleaned the palate. For myself, I had the gateau marjolaine which had some of the most decadent fudge on it that I have ever eaten, along with a deep chocolate glace sitting on the same tuile unfolded with I believe walnuts underneath it. A sprinkling of fresh berries finished the plate.  An excellent pot of French Press coffee finished off the meal.  As is expected in a restaurant of this caliber, service is polished and cleanliness is on point. Companion only had one complaint and that was with the continuous water to wash hands in the restroom. Companion felt that it was impossible to open a door without it having been touched before by someone who use the restroom first and had not yet washed their hands.   5 stars for excellent service, excellent food, cleanliness and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cristopher's Restaurant (former  Crush Lounge) is a really high quality and fun place to eat.  I was in town for a conference and several of my colleagues recommended this restaurant.  Glad I went.  First, I have to start off this review by saying that the service here is OUTSTANDING.  Or, maybe just our waiter (John or was it David?) was the bombshadiggidy.  He immediately greeted everyone and learned our names (and used it throughout the night).  Super professional and funny service.  Awesome!  For appetizers, I had the Foie Gras pate.  It was served with bread and pickled vegetables.  Very traditional French, and very fun to eat!   Grade:  B  For my main meal, I ordered the Foie Gras Prepared Sous Vide.  This dish was well worth the hefty price tag.  It was delicious and well prepared.  Seared foie gras served in it's glory, accompanied by roasted brussel sprouts white and purple cauliflower, and plated with a delicious sauce.  Beautiful presentation.  Quality cuts of foie gras.

{"text":"Since my initial review, I have been back twice, once for NYE with a large party and once for an intimate dinner.  Both absolutely fantastic.  Try sitting up at the exhibition kitchen to watch the master talent unfold before your eyes... it's really quite amazing to see the chefs in action and in unison produce such excellent food."}
{"text":"07/25/11  I have a new crush... and it's Christopher's Restaurant's pizza!    I've been holding onto a restaurant.com gift certificate I'd purchased to use at Crush Lounge for a long time now and decided it was time to use it.  I arrived w/ high expectations, of both the ambience and the food, and I wasn't disappointed... much.  The service was a bit spotty at times- we were immediately greeted when we entered and were seated quickly, but the wait that came after water delivery was a bit long at a time when there were no other guests seated around us.  (Perhaps there were other guests seated elsewhere, but they weren't seated at the lounge, at the food bar, nor outside... Indeed, it seemed like were were the only ones in the room, besides the cooks at the open kitchen area, the servers, and the bartenders.)  Bread was delivered, but we were each given only one one-inch slice of a baguette.  How strange, especially when the butter cup held enough butter to spread over a whole loaf!  Whatever...  Two of the three dinner specials were relayed to us, w/ the promise of coming back to tell me about the scallop dish, but when our server finally came back ten or so minutes later, he asked if we were ready to order, so I had to remind him about the scallop entree... What was in it, and how was it prepared, and how much?  Hmmm, maybe he was ready to go home...  Came in w/ Mom, so we had to try the calamari.  I also chose the Duck confit, goat cheese, and fig pizza.  For dessert, we had the profiteroles.  I really liked the calamari's coating-- lightly battered and fried golden-brown.  My fave pieces of the squid are also my Mom's fave, the tentacles, so these were soon finished.  At least half of the remaining pieces, the sliced bodies, were undercooked-- poor value for the $12 menu price tag (and I was charged $13 on the ticket).  The pizza* was TERRIFIC!  Loved the semolina thin crust, and the duck confit gave the entree a great smoky flavor-- I thought perhaps there were lardons included in this dish too, but all the smokiness came from the duck.  Mmmm.... The goat cheese was very creamy, and there were lovely chopped figs all over the place-- I'd order this pizza again in a heartbeat!  The profiteroles were fantastic, as well.  Three sliced choux pastry rounds, filled w/ dark chocolate sorbet, vanilla, and chocolate ice cream, sat on a pretty display made of chocolate ganache and creme anglaise, whole blackberries and blueberries, and a sliced strawberry.  More ganache was poured over the top of one profiterole upon presentation.  I asked if I could have more ganache, and our server quickly obliged-- thank you!!  We loved the crisped flakiness of the pastry (so perfect!), and out of the three flavors, we liked the fudgy dark chocolate sorbet the most.  I tell you, if I could've licked the plate clean, I would have.  :)  Excellent dessert-- I totally recommend!  (*Pizza reheats well!  Still lovely in flavor and just as crispy as it was when it was first delivered.  Can't wait to go back and try the other varieties!  Happy hour UYE, anyone?)"}
{"text":"So my Dad has been wanting to go to this restaurant for forever it seems. He lives on the East Coast and saw it in some restaurant review article.   This week he came to visit so we decided to make reservations. The restaurant had a typical Biltmore atmosphere, nice but snooty. The chairs were very comfortable and the decor was nice. However, there did seem to be a lot of white noise which kind of made it difficult to hear my 4 dinner companions. The bathrooms were very clean and had a really neat sink/rock sculpture/fountain thing going on.  But that's not why you're reading this review. You're reading for the most important question, \"How was the food?\".  The appetizers, salads and sides were great. We tried the buttered lobster salad, the parsnip soup, the curried duck fries, potatoes au gratin, and the asparagus. They were all quite yummy.  Desserts were also yummy. We had the vanilla flan, the tower of chocolate mousse, and the profiteroles au chocolat. Nom, nom, nom. Is all I have to say.  The entrees however, were very disappointing. The duck two ways was bland and both ways tasted exactly the same. The rack of lamb had almost no flavor as if it had not been seasoned at all. I've quite frequently made better racks of lamb myself at home. The truffle oil filet mignon was also merely adequate. The portions were extremely small   Honestly, for the price Christopher's just really isn't worth it. While the appetizers and desserts are yummy I've can easily have similar items as delicious at much cheaper restaurants. The entrees are definitely not worth it. Small, bland, uninteresting, and overpriced."}
{"text":"I went back to see if there's any change. Unfortunately, it dropped 1/2 point from my last review. It's a 3 now.  My lamb was good, but the fried lamb croquette was pointless and tasteless. Bf's rabbit's presentation was \"Excellent.\" My other friend's fish dish was dry and kinda bleh. Overall, the food didn't impress me at all, not like they used to.  Service was so so.  Before they moved to a new location in Biltmore, and New York-ize the place, I visited the old, vintage-looking Christopher's quite frequently for the pastry escargo, duck confit, filet mignon, 20-out-of-10 foie gras appetizer, and could never forget Friday's specials Osso Bucco.  Right after their reopening (a few months ago), we were excited to come back but tremendously disappointed with the food. The menu was changed. Those dishes which made us drive 20 miles were replaced with new varieties with lower quality, or just completely removed. The lamb was tough, and foie gras was replaced with foie gras mousse. One thing still delicious was their Stick Fries. While I don't mind the new, sheek, loud atmosphere at all, I still miss the old vintage ambiance.  - Is it still a good place to visit? Yes. - Is it as good as before? I don't think so. - Will I come back? Probably, as it is not easy finding a good French restaurant in this valley. I'll just try to forget the amazing old Christopher's Fermier, and think of it as a new trendy typical Scottsdale restaurant."}
{"text":"Picked Christopher's for our anniversary dinner and it couldn't have worked out any better.  Our mid week night out was a special treat.    Had big plans to try some delicious looking entrees, but ended up filling ourselves with a selection of their petit plates.  Mixed pommes, Smoked tuna spoons, crispy pig ears, foie gras, and scallops all delighted us with their fantastic flavors and presentation.    Jeannie wasn't sure if she could finish it, but she went ahead and ordered the smoked salmon salad and I couldn't resist ordering the clams and frisee salad. Their in house smoked salmon is the best I have ever had!  I was so full, but had to finish the perfectly prepared clams.  Did enjoy my salad as well!  We were too stuffed to order dessert, but were treated to a special chocolate messaged \"Happy Anniversary\" plate with a scoop of vanilla ice cream sitting in a   delicate edible chocolate flavored cup.  Add to that the sparkler candle, and it was the end to a wonderful meal.   We were well taken care of at Christopher's and enjoyed every minute we spent there.  Look forward to another visit. Next time we will sit at the bar and watch the chefs work!"}
{"text":"After finding out that Christopher Gross was crushin' it by moving to The Wrigley Mansion, I didn't want to feel crushed that I didn't have a chance to eat at Christopher's/Crush Lounge before they closed up shop at the Biltmore. We decided to go here for happy hour to try out some discounted bites!   There's essentially three sections to the restaurant: the sit down restaurant, the bar and the lounge which has couch seating and an additional bar. I chose a comfy spot at the lounge and we browsed through both the happy hour and petit plates menu. The happy hour had more basic items such as burgers, soup and pizza while the petit plates menu had more French inspired food. I ended up with the happy hour red bell pepper soup, as well as the petit plate torchon and terrine. I also had a few bites of the pig's ear and duck confit fries.   The red pepper soup was a generous amount and tasted like the fresh essence of red bell pepper. It had a lighter taste vs rich and creamy. The terrine was well seasoned and very smooth from the use of duck liver. I absolutely loved the torchon, with its decadent flavors and smooth creamy texture of foie gras and truffle. I would definitely get the torchon again.  While the pig's ear dish was nicely battered and fried, I couldn't really taste any pork flavor nor any texture of actual pig's ear. I prefer the version they have at Crudo where the ears have a more prominent focus in the dish and you are aware you are eating a pork product. The duck confit was stringy and a bit tough which surprised me since I usually associate confit with tender meat slow cooked in some sort of fat.  Service was polite but seemed a bit disinterested. The lounge setup for eating is a bit weird too since the large couch area only has a tiny table to balance food on so if you get multiple items they have to pull out some footstools to provide more countertop space to put plates on.  Overall it was a decent experience mainly due to the loveliness of the torchon and terrine. I'd definitely be interested in seeing what dishes will be in Christopher Gross's next adventure into Phoenix's restaurant industry."}

{"text":"Having been to all of the Christopher's over the years, we were excited to go to the newest one for a celebratory meal with our teenage daughter who loves good food.   the ambiance is chic and modern.  disliked being seated next to the waiter station though we had made reservations days previously.   service was friendly and smart, but the waitress was way over worked.  other tables complained to management, but heck, we were out for the evening, it didn't matter to us how long we took at their table as long as the food was hot.   wine list is extensive, albeit a bit pricey (to be expected for this Biltmore-area establishment).  we ordered truffle fries as a \"starter.\"  Good....but way too many and needed much more salt.  The Alsatian Onion and bacon tart was tasty, but overwhelmed by too much vinegar mixed into the onions -- and this comes from a vinegar fan family.    Burrata and beet salad was tasty, but with only one quartered beet on the plate, buried among huge piles of butter lettuce leaves (very awkward to eat), it lost some points. The Duck Confit salad was a hit with my hubby though.    main courses-- pied de cochon (yes, pigs feet) in pastry with braised cabbage.  would have been good if it was not cloyingly sweet.  Escargot en crote was enjoyed by the snail lovers that the table.  My duck confit, goat chese and fig pizza was a disappointment...very little duck, too many dried figs that got drier in the wood fired oven, and dry goat cheese.  Lemon tart for dessert was great.    Waitress disappeared during bill paying time so we left our cash and our \"leftovers\" were forgotten (as they hadn't been delivered to our table).  We ended up turning back and getting them to have for today's lunch, not that they were that exceptional, but for the price we paid, we might as well get another meal out of them.  I am sure that this restaurant has its off nights, but for $200 for 2 people with no wine, we expected more."}
{"text":"Service is very spotty. Sitting at bar, server forgot a drink order/disappeared for 15+ minutes then when she finally came back made the (non-sarcastic) snide comment that \"since I disappeared I guess I'm a bad person.\"   Pricey even on HH.  Would never pay full price for the food or drinks.  The arugula salad was good but small. The crust on the pizza is good but the toppings (shallots/arugula) were pretty flavorless.   Fun/good atmosphere - main bar area with open kitchen is cool. They have a nice, romantic, separate lounge with cozy furniture and another (smaller) bar (but no happy hour in there).  Mirror at communal bathroom sink is deteriorating at base and looks gross/needs fixing."}
{"text":"I Visited Christopher's on a Monday evening and was surprised upon walking in at how dead the place was. There were only two other tables occupied in the entire  restaurant. This being the case you would think we would have got prompt attention and great service but it seemed to be the opposite.  We ordered and the long wait began. We started with the escargot, it was delicious, so delicious we ordered another for the table. I ordered the lobster salad and it was fresh and tasty, my friend got the goat cheese parmesan salad and it came warm, as though it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while, for the amount of time it took to get our salads that seemed to be exactly the situation.   We ordered our mains and while the food was good, the wait was almost unbearable. It took almost an hour to get our mains, I couldn't understand what had taken so long considering at this point we were the only people in the place.  I ordered the lamb, when it arrived the demi- glaze on the plate was hardened and the meat was barely warm. I think our server may be partially to blame, the food would have been much better had it not sat plated for so long before being brought out.  The same could be said for the dessert, it was decent, but the long wait didn't make it worth while. All in all it took a table of four over three hours and thirty minutes to get through dinner. Not a good experience for the amount of money we dropped.   While I will give 3 stars for the freshness and quality of the  food, there are too many other great restaurants in Phoenix to go have to endure the mediocre service at Christopher's."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but it didn't quite meet my expectations. To start, it was unusually quiet for a Friday night. We were among perhaps 20 guests total, four of which were in the lounge with the remainder seated in the dining room. The service was not as attentive as I would have preferred it to be. At one time, the bartender took my order and then proceeded to walk away before we stopped him to take my other guests' orders. They were out of the smoked salmon, which we were all looking forward to trying via various dishes. The fried raviolis were far too salty for my palette, though it may have been from the chorizo oil. I might try this spot again due to the intriguing lounge atmosphere. I'd love to see it in full swing with all of its glory. It's certainly got potential. I'd love to see them reach it!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but just not my cup of tea.  Crush bar is cool, but a bit pricey.  I liked the old location and the unpretentiousness of it.  The new location is too much glitz and glamor for me.  Christopher is great Chef and did a great job with the menu.  Many of friends love the food here.  I wish they'd do something to screen the patio from the parking lot.  I don't like the idea of looking into a field of cars in a parking structure when I'm enjoying a higher priced cocktail."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the dining experience at Christopher's. Overall, it was a really nice place (fine-dining, as many may call it). Ambiance was impecable! The food was surely delicious and prompt you to comeback for more. Most of all, we had a really good bottle of wine, which made the experience a lot more lovely.   Of course, the price is the only drawback, but you will get what you paid for...again, it's a fine dining. For certain, I don't mind to have a dinner-date here. It is a fine attribute for the modern-romance ambiance.   I heart this place."}
{"text":"Mmmm...Lobster Pot Pie, Mac & Cheese and Risotto.  So good!  I'm still in a food coma."}
{"text":"We went to Christopher's last night for our 17th wedding anniversary.  This is a fabulous restaurant.  The food was delicious, portions were generous, waiter and staff were superb.  We started with red pepper soup which was plenty to split.  It was delicious.  My entree was duck which was cooked two ways.  Both ways were excellent and it was served with baby carrots, potatoes, and brussel sprouts.  The crusty bread was fabulous and they bring as much as you want.  Menu is pricey but you really do get your money's worth.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to out of town visitors and anyone looking for a top notch meal.  We will return."}
{"text":"Lunch at Christopher's and Crush Lounge was just okay. The service was very good, but the oversized / overcharged plates with small portions of food get a naaayyy waaayyy in my book. I understand they have to pay rent, but damn, have some plating respect.   Also, why they ax'ing if we had reservations...uh, the restaurant was empty. But, okay, they're keeping up appearances. Go 'head wit'cha bad self.  Like many other restaurants, if you want to eat vegetarian your only food choices at Christopher's are from a short list of salads, pizzas, and sides. I was hoping to try a soup, but the soups were made with chicken stock so I passed. [My mouth had already been violated that week from another restaurant that put sausage on my vegetarian pizza. Hisssss!]  Pre-meal the waiter served each of us a portion of bread and sat a serving of butter on the table. I have no idea why a bread basket wasn't placed on the table, it would have saved him from having to come over again and again to give each of us one more portion. Damn, is bread going extinct? Ain't like it was the best bread in the city either. It was a hard crusted baguette - crunchy and not too chewy because the inside was hardly there at all. It had more holes than swiss cheese. My jaws were tired.   First course: Salads for vegetarians ($10 each) and escargot in puff pastry for carnivores ($14)  Second course: veggie pizza ($12), bacon and shallot pizza ($16), scallops with veggies ($19), burger with mixed fries ($12), and side ($9)  Third course:  Desserts ($10 each) - chocolate mousse tower, tarte tatin, cheesecake, and berry tart.   Of the desserts the tower was the most eye-catching, but I don't like mousse so I didn't taste it. I tasted the other three and liked tarte tatin the best. It was warm with large apple chunks, good crust, and not overly sweet. Served with a side scoop (er, a side spoonful) of ice cream in a sugary cookie crisp.  I think the cheesecake was made with ricotta cheese, but I'm not certain. I've had good ricotta cheesecake, but unfortunately did not like this one. The crust was similar to an eggroll wrapper and was only crispy on the edges; the rest of the wrapper was chewy. And the cheese seemed egg-y as well. Weird. The sauce was the best part of that dessert but it couldn't cover up all that egginess jazz.  The berry tart had fresh berries sitting in a pastry dough with yucky yellow custard stuff. Try it at your own tastebuds' risk.  Back to the food...this is what I ate: - Arugula salad with point reyes blue, fennel & poached pear ($10) Seriously, Christopher, what's hard about serving a decent salad? One slice of pear and one slice of tomato? Fu¢k!ng insulting. Cheese crisp and candied nuts shouldn't be the main ingredients of a salad!  - Tomato trio, mozzarella & basil pizza ($12) I requested my half of the pizza without mozza and it was delicious. The tomatoes themselves were like sauce and really made the pizza. Perfect flavor and good dough too.  - Side of yam fries ($9) Typical serving of mechanically thin cut fries accompanied by ketchup and mayo/aioli. For that price? Really?   So, anyway, I'm glad that I went, but honestly I don't see what the fuss is about. The only thing upscale about our afternoon out was the bill. But, that's Biltmore folks! That's Biltmore."}
{"text":"This Happy Hour spot was recommended to us.. it's always fun to check out a new spot with the girls after a day of shopping .. we were tired and starving and this place came through for us.  The ambiance in the lounge with the comfy seating was exactly what we needed. The Happy Hour and Small Plate menus are ridiculous.. great prices and selections.   We shared the mushroom arugula & tomato mozzarella pizzas.. the crust was perfect!! The calamari was light with the right amount of crunch and no oily residue.. the mac & cheese with ham was rich and cheesy... the truffle fries were perfect for sharing .. the bacon and taleggio pizza had too much cheese on it (if that's possible) but the bacon on the crust was heavenly..   Great prices, huge drink menu, awesome service... can't wait for the next Happy Hour at this place!!"}
{"text":"Went for Restaurant Week and had a fantastic time.  The service was superb; the food was excellent; the wine pairings were reasonably priced and perfect for the dishes served.  I would prefer that it be a stand-alone business rather than in a mall, but once inside the dining room, you are insulated from the hustle and bustle, and are treated like you are the most important person in the place.  A truly excellent dinner, truly excellent service, and, overall a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Great staff, Good food, High Price Tag  Food and wine was great. So was the service. The staff made my wife's birthday very memorable and even placed the flowers I had delivered on the table for her.   Even though the food was good, the portion sizes were very small. Normally at a fine dinning restaurant that is ok and expected, but there are things to make up for it. The atmosphere did not lend to a $38 per entrée plate and a $10 side dish charge. And the food was not that amazing to lend to the cost either. I would not recommend this place to a friend for that very reason. Good service is hard to find, but it shouldn't cost that much. I have been to plenty of other restaurants where the food was amazing, the atmosphere was exquisite and the cost was about $10 less per plate."}
{"text":"The first night we went here it was very quiet and we enjoyed the wild mushroom soup $18. enough that we would return the following evening for another 2 bowls.  The lobster salad $18 was just okay, the lobster was on the tough side.  Dessert was a vanilla flan, not the typical Mexican version, very small, intensely delicious and a larger portion would have been over the top.  Our server, the same both nights, was very professional and personable.  On the second visit the wild mushroom soup was lacking, I believe it to be due to the fact that they were busy with a large party.  Compared to the previous night the soup lacked the number of mushrooms, the foie gras wasn't as seared and so lacked the intense flavor,  it was also not as hot enough, and had too much foam, so the actual volume of the soup was less.  After asking what the truffle frites $9 were, we decided we had to try them.  They arrived hot tossed with a little truffle oil and sprinkled with pecorino.  These were fabulous.  I can't believe that I like fries, what a difference from the American version.   I'll definetly give them a try on another slow night and will sit at the Chef's bar, so I can direct if necessary. Yea, right!"}
{"text":"My top choice for HH is Christopher's.  I am not a big eater and after the HH menu I am quite full. I always get the same every time I go since I like it so much.  The salmon salad. I have it cooked medium and juice inside with the outside crisp.  It comes with a side of green salad. The salmon is served with chopped tomatoes on top. I am not crazy for tomatoes on my salmon so I push them off and ask for extra lemon sauce.  The tomatoes are perfect with their fresh French bread. I have never tasted salmon as good as prepared by their chef. The salmon is half off for HH My friend also orders the mac and cheese and a chocolate tower dessert which she swears by. I know recently they have had a complete change in employees.  The last 2 times we were there we had this waiter who is a little bit slow. He disappears for some time after you ask for something and sometimes have had to ask twice. I am rating the restaurant and the food as five stars and would take away 1-2 points on the last star due to the waiter. I am counting on him to improve."}
{"text":"I had the goat cheese and roasted garlic pizza and it was phenomenal! The creamy tang of the goat cheese paired well with the whole cloves of roasted garlic and perfect, airy yet substantial, crust. As for dessert, I had the tower of mousse and that was just straight-up ambrosia. Anyways, I enjoyed my experience and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I have been really wanting to go to Christopher's for awhile now, so when some fabulous fellow yelpers invited me to join them after the elite event at Capital Grille I was very excited.   We went for happy hour, which is a great deal.  The wine list is a novel, you may want to bring a book mark or some sticky tabs, because at 1/2 off you'll be wanting to try a few.   Our server had his hands full with so many yelpers, but did a great job and was very flexible with our separate checks.  Golden. It's hard to choose what to get, everything looks amazing, but the hubby and I settled on the sopressata and ricotta pizza.  The crust was divine, really really good, the toppings didn't hit the spot for us, I'll be trying another one next time.  The mac-n-cheese that was passed around our table was amazing.  Order. It.  Really. The place is nice.  Very nice.  However the sink freaks me out, makes me feel like someone is going to grab my hands and pull me in, but Christopher's is in no way responsible for my neurotic tendencies. Anyway, I'll be back, for more wine, lots of mac-n-cheese, and probably one of the happy hour burgers I've heard so much about."}
{"text":"I decided to come here for the Phoenix restaurant week which happened to be going on at the same time I was here for my lazy vacation away. Honestly, the reviews from some friends looked god and it looked like a decently nice place so I decided to come by.   There were two hostesses and they were dressed pretty casually. Not a big deal, but I came a bit early for my reservation (by myself). I know that it's strange sometimes for someone to go to a restaurant by themselves, but I felt like I was ignored by the hostesses. It took a while (about like 15 minutes after my reservation time) before I got seated - even though there was PLENTY of space.   I did end up going with the restaurant week menu and had a pretty good time.  I started off with scallops. There was a weird taste on the actual scallops which I disliked a lot. It was kind of fishy and not all that good. The petite ravioli that came with it were delicious and my favorite part of the dish.  My main course was the duck - I do love me some duck breast. It was a little more pink than I liked it, but it was still so good. Probably my favorite dish.  I ended with the Gaetuae. I loved the ice cream, but didn't love the other parts.   Overall, the service by my waiter was great, but my food was just average and okay. The service by that hostess - please no. I could do without her attitude about me coming in a bit early for my reservation and her accusatory tone for coming in as one person.   Protip: food's decent. service by the waitstaff is good."}
{"text":"Had lunch today there for the first time and I was pretty impressed. The food was great and service is impeccable. We had the express lunch which consisted of your choice of a first course, entree and desert for $20. Everything was very good!   Also, love the free bread & butter they give you!"}
{"text":"Beautifully and freshly prepared food with a french flair. I eat alone a lot and sitting at the chefs bar is perfect. You cant go wrong here. Many original dishes you can only get here like Cedar River's AZ smoked truffle infused filet mignon. Rivals the best I've had in Paris"}
{"text":"We previously ate at Christopher's during restaurant week, and our experience was not a good one. Immediately after my review I received a message from Christopher, and he took my feedback to heart. I was shocked to receive a message so quickly, and I could immediately tell how much he cared. He invited us back, and we agreed to give the restaurant another try.   Wow is all I can say. From the moment we walked in until the moment we left, we had an exceptional experience. Our waiter, Greg, was phenomenal. He provided expertise, genuine care, and was attentive to our every need. He made excellent recommendations, and our meals were absolutely perfect. Everything, from our fabulous cocktails, to our salads, and our mouthwatering steaks, was incredible.   Ben, the manager, checked in with us periodically to ensure our expectations were met. We had a wonderful evening, and will definitely be back. I am so impressed with Christopher and his team, and can honestly see why he is so incredibly successful."}
{"text":"I'm biased, so lets get that out of the way first. That being said, the guy knows how to cook and places his customers at a level above all else. Is he pleasant to work with? Who cares, thats not why you go here. You go to his restaurant to be amazed, impressed, and well taken care of. He is an artist and deserves his reputation as one of the area's best chefs. A casual stop at the bar for happy hour or a romantic date with your significant other...its a treat. Enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  One of my wife's favorite restaurants.  French cuisine with a Southwestern twist is what got Chef Gross his James Beard Award and it's well-deserved.  It's always a plus to see chef himself there almost every time we've been there.  My wife always, always, gets the escargot en croute.  She loves this dish, especially here.  I've always enjoyed the foie gras.  The frisee salad (yes, very early-90's) has always been good, improved with the addition of the poached egg.  The deconstructed lobster pot pie is a signature here, and the pig's feet and hanger steak have been excellent.    The restaurant deserves 4, almost 5 stars, for food and service.  But I'm including the Crush lounge experience here too, and that is more unfortunate.  My biggest knock, the lounge prices are as high as the food quality is good across the way.  That's for the drinks.  Food prices are the same but that means paying a little more for \"bar food\" if that's what you're looking for.  It's slick inside, the patio outside is small, but I've just never felt comfortable in the Crush Lounge side.    So a solid 4 stars for the entire lot.  Considering all the fine dining, not just in Arizona, but in the States, this place is worth making repeat visits to."}
{"text":"Happy hour amazing! Happy hour time the Gourmet burger for $7. Bar is nicely done. White linen and great service. Business setting. Classy! Loved it and I will return."}
{"text":"Omg, where to begin? ...this area is full of fancy upscale restaurants, just go there! This place was hard to find, I walked around Macy's 10 times and couldn't find it. The server was more like California Pizza Kitchen server than upscale restaurant... he was getting upset when we didn't like the dish and I could feel his vibes! Also, when we asked what was his favorite SEAFOOD dish, he started describing all the meat options. When we stoped him and asked for best seafood dish again, he said he was getting there  ( after we said twice I don't eat meat and not interested listening about it)!  THEY RAN OT OF EVERYTHING WE AKSED FOR! Ooops, I'm sorry it's a Friday night and you don't have another bottle to same wine, or ANY pizza dow for appetizer OR fish! The menu is very poor, there is NO appetizers available other than 2 kinda of soups, and mussels! We went with mussels ( comes with chorizo so not for vegetarians, we had to ask it on the side ), it was okay, nothing special. Bread that was served at the beginning was so hard that I was afraid to break my $20,000 veneers Then we got the fish of the day, that was supposed to be a seabass, But guess what? They were out of it too! We went with the Sol instead, but when the server brought the fish it was sea bass, like he said it was last two pieces they found! Well, it looked like it was last two pieces  Tasted like unwashed cow, and looked worse than I would cook at home, like a tiny end of fish tail! Not a $45 dish! I immediately returned it back. Instead they brought SOL, that tasted like steamed tasteless tilapia, breaded! Oh, the side dish was $9 mashed potatoes, as fish comes in small piece with 2 brocades sprouts next to it!  So, yes, I'm spoiled as I traveled the world and ate at the finest restaurant around the globe. I know what sea bass supposed to taste and what kind of service I need to get at the $$$ or $$$$ Restaurants! All I'm asking is don't put yourself on this scale when you deliver service and quality food of a overage restaurant. The worst experience ever! Don't waste your time and money. At the end we paid $345 between 3 of us! The best part of it was the wine, thanks god you can't fuck this one up, and desert was good too! ?"}
{"text":"I dined at this restaurant on a Saturday morning and was actually the very first guest.  I got greeted by the hostess and was promptly seated.  The service was phenomenal from when I walked over the door step and the ambiance is the restaurant was amazing .  I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer and the daily scallop special as the entree.  When my salmon dish came out I said to my self \"WHAT in the hell?\" Two extremely thin slices of salmon, little salad, and a piece of bread with some aioli on the side.  Salmons cheap and they charged me $15 for this crap?  I work in the food industry and the food was crap.  Next, the entree.  The waiter described the the scallop dish like it was heaven on earth.  Explaining to me how delicious this special was.  So I took his advice and ordered.  When the dish came out I said to my self again \"What in the HELL?\"  Four small scallops, 2 baby carrots, broccoli rabe, and cilantro sauce.  The scallops weren't seared enough, the broccoli rabe was brown and mush, and the baby carrots were still raw.  The funny thing was.  The sauce didn't even resemble any cilantro flavor at all.  I could of made this dish 1000x better and the entree took a big hit in my wallet, $32 for crap.  The meal came out to roughly $60 and I left that restaurant to never try it again.  I could of gotten some pho for $8 would of been a hundred times happier than spending money that wasn't even mediocre."}
{"text":"Exceptional food and service.  Took my in-laws to Christopher's to celebrate a retirement and had an even better experience the second visit.  The food was perfectly prepared, top quality, and tasted superb.   Josh was our server and managed our experience perfectly-- courses landed together, drinks never emptied, he was great with our 4 year-old, and was intimately knowledgeable about the preparation of the options.  Couldn't ask for a better dinner.  Only odd thing is that this restaurant is in a high-end strip mall and splits with a small bar.  Not bad things, necessarily.  Just not things one sees often.  Then again... ZinBurger is also in that mall."}
{"text":"I really want to give Christopher's five stars because I have always had delicious food there, love the atmosphere's blend of fine dining and a hipper, more urban feel, and have nothing but high praise for their drinks, wine list, and the servers' and bartenders' aptitude to make wine pairing suggestions.  But there is just something a little off with the service here, which makes me hold back on that final star.  Don't get me wrong, I have never had anything but good service here, but it just doesn't hold up to the level that you'd expect from a restaurant that, at least by menu and price, purports to be a higher level establishment.  I've found my servers to be friendly and provide adequate and timely service consistently, but more often than not, they're also a bit too familiar, too casual, too disinterested, and bordering on, if not well into the realm of, flippant.  If I was dining at Oregano's, the Vig, or a Sam Fox restaurant, this might not seem odd to me.  But at Christopher's, with its white napkins and tablecloths, proper place settings, and elegant French menu, it just mars my experience a bit.  That being said, Christopher's and Crush Lounge are always one of my favorite spots for a long, indulgent lunch, a delicious French dinner, or a few bites at the bar.  They have a solid burger and fries (truffled fries are also on the menu!), a lovely cheese selection, delicious mussels served with slices of Spanish chorizo, well-prepared fois gras, and an unmissable tender and rich pig's foot (try it, you'll like it!).  They do a reasonably priced and never-disappointing 6-course tasting menu ($75) with wine pairings ($25).  Their drinks are fantastic and I always find a wine I love while dining there.  I'd steer clear of the escargot en croute - it's baked with a layer of puff pastry rather than served with crusty bread and the addition of tomatoes, to me, just detracts from the richness of the garlic butter I love to sop up after each little snail has been devoured.  But, truly, it's difficult to go wrong with anything on Christopher's/Crush Lounge's menu."}
{"text":"It's interesting that I'm going to review a restaurant that is about to close. This is a long time Biltmore classic. The chef Christopher is leaving this location and he's now going to be the chef at the Wrigley mansion.  I went on a Monday for happy hour and there were not many people in the bar. Eventually maybe a total of 10 people came and went.  The bartender Jim, was very from friendly and provided good service. Christopher came out a couple different times and was very happy to chat.  As far as happy hour goes if you can get there before this establishment closes, it's a pretty good deal. All of their beer and wine is half price during happy hour. Plus they have a variety of appetizers which I found to be quite enjoyable. I have a number of pictures of some of the items we had.  Sadly this will close but I'm looking forward to seeing what Christopher does at the Wrigley mansion."}
{"text":"Great place with some interesting cheffy dishes. I had sweetbreads the last time I went and they were tender and wonderful. Great service and atmosphere.  It is a bit pricey, but definitely worth it, given the interesting menu, atmosphere and service.  Very easy parking in the Biltmore parking structure."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Christopher's last night as a result of purchasing last week's Groupon. I thought the wait staff and ambience were top notch. The food, to be honest, left a little bit to be desired. Put simply, I thought it was overpriced (I'm not cheap, either). I ordered the Filet Mignon, which was an excellent piece of meat, but cooked rarer then I had asked for, which in my opinion, getting the order right shouldn't even be a consideration at $36. Moreover, it didn't come with any sides, so it was an additional $7 for some potatoes, although they were quite good, but should have just come with the entree. I'd like to visit Crush (although, it has looked dead the half-dozen times I've walked by).  In the end, I felt nickeled and dimed. Its meant to impress people, but I am not sure who I'd impress by taking them there. I may go back at some point, but there are just too many options nearby to justify a so-so $60 meal."}
{"text":"The service was awesome and perfect, but the treasure is the food. Had a filet mignon that was just perfection. Seeing the look on my fiancé' face when she had the mushroom soup, was priceless, too. As she said, which perfectly describes everything we ordered, it was like fireworks of flavor when eating. The bell pepper soup was phenomenal as well. By far the best place I've been to, and reminds me why I love food so much and how much I appreciate the art of being a one of a kind chef."}
{"text":"Such a weird vibe...Maybe we came at an off time (1pm on a Saturday), but when we walked in the host looked almost like he was sleeping. Definitely zoned out, with his chin in his hand and I swear practically drooling, staring at his computer screen. Didn't greet us. We said, \"We're just grabbing a drink at the bar\" and walked in. He could have told us we were walking to the wrong side, but didn't and we ended up at the food side with cooks. Sat down and one of them pointed us in the right direction. So now we're the only people at the bar, paying $24 dollars for one Stella and one martini. Did I mention the music? Retro techno. Awful. And the artwork is offensive 80s."}
{"text":"While the price was expected, the less than mediocre food was not.  The lobster soup was perfection, but that is where perfection ends.  Two in our party of four ordered the daily pork special (pre-printed on the menu).  One dish was so tough and chewy their thought was to take it home and recook.  The other had fine texture, but lacked in flavor.  My tenderloin was average (hard to mess this one up), but had no truffle flavor even though it was supposedly infused with truffles. The tenderloin was served with over cooked fingerling carrots.  The presentations were all very nice, but lacked in taste and/or texture quality. Other dishes ordered included a cheese plate with fruit (the fruit consisted of a 5 each raspberries and blackberries and 2 strawberries and the honeycomb (while good) was less than a tsp in size), the cheese brought to the table was either not what was ordered or it was moldy (the flavors were terrible and I am familiar with both of the cheeses chosen), calamari (this had a light batter and was not chewy) but was average, roasted bell pepper soup (this was ripe with an over abundance of truffle oil) and the mousse tower for dessert was definitely great in presentation, but was just a pretty chocolate mousse.  The bread they brought to the table was day old, but was okay when dunked in the soup. They gave us each a loaf of bread to take home.  I am thinking they did so because there were only 2 tables of diners, ours (party of 4) and one other (party of 2).  The service was spot on and staff were very nice.  However, we will not return.   We left and went to the gelato shop and when we walked back by they were closed for the night already.  It is my opinion, Christopher should either be on site to ensure quality or close shop to save his reputation."}
{"text":"I'll post a review of my one happy hour experience there. I intend to go back for more. Again and again.  The happy hour runs from 3 to 6, and it was suggested--no--urgently pleaded to me by other regulars that I go just for one dish available half-price during that time: The cheeseburger. It's honest-to-god prime rib ground on premises, served on a ciabatta roll with a selection of yam and potato fries.   And yes, it is delicious.   It was so delicious  that I want to go back to try the rest of the happy hour menu. It was so fully worth the $7 that I think I would have felt satisfied paying the full $14. I want to work my way through the menu and report back each time.  When you enter the hostess politely asks if you came only for drinks (most of which are half-price during HH) or food as well. If it's only drinks you get to sit in the hip-a-riffic wine bar to your left, where stylish Helmut-Newton-looking pictures of fabulous babes with wine wait to stimulate you. If you are going to avail yourself of the food menu you are directed to the Cadillac of lunch counters, where all places are set with fine linen and silverware. You get to watch chefs prepare your meal in front of you. Sound exotic? It's more like Kresge's circa 1974, but the experience of eating brilliant impeccable food from a five-and-dime lunch counter is thrilling in a way.  The downside--if there is one--is that there is basically none of the \"vibe\" that you'd get in a more sporty place. This is a nice, quiet, high-toned place, So maybe \"happy hour\" is a misnomer. Maybe it's more of a \"Maslovian Elevation Hour\", where one can sit and reflect that if one has time and means to enjoy a perfectly lovely prime-rib cheeseburger for $7, life isn't so bad after all.  So yes, thumbs up."}
{"text":"Artfully crafted and Fantastic Presentation!  You can always count on a great experience here!!"}
{"text":"I'm having a difficult time with this review. While the food is good, the service was abysmal. The restaurant wasn't packed, and in all fairness- it seemed as if there was only one waiter. However, there were many people standing around. Every time we would look for our waiter, he was gone. Or he would run off mid sentence before we could say \"I would like to order...\".  We ordered a bottle of wine we enjoy- and it was completely corked. The cork was destroyed upon opening and a sponge. So, we did the unthinkable. We sent it back. We asked our server to try it - to see if he agreed. The waiter was very moody about it.  When we got our bill, they tried to charge us for the corked wine!  Chef Gross stopped in and greeted guests, which was nice- but the terrible service left our stomachs sour- which is dumbfounding for a James beard award winning restaurant."}
{"text":"Full review blogged, high points here.  The Space:  While I have heard some complain that Christopher's is inside a swanky shopping mall I counter that commentary by noting that the best restaurant in the United States shares the same dubious distinction and with Chef Gross visible front and center of the open kitchen with wrap around bar I was impressed by Christopher's the moment I walked in.  Bathed in light from the outside at first and then dissipating to a romantic glow as the sun set both the lounge and the dining room at Christopher's have a modern but refined feel with white tablecloths, fine service ware, and comfortable seating abound while the walls are minimally adorned with single flowers, wooden art, and mirrors.  The Service:  Pleasant, descriptive, whimsical, and efficient James did a great job of working with my friend's allergies while additionally being sure water was always filled and bread was replenished as necessary - an admirable feat as he was probably the only captain on our half of the dining room thus quarterbacking at least four back servers working perhaps twenty tables without ever missing a beat.  The Food: Wood Oven Pizza with Foie Gras, Andouillette, Boudin Noir & Goat Cheese:  An 8-slice oblong pie clearly focused on decadence I must say that I was hesitant to order pizza in a French restaurant but this $26 dish worked astonishingly well.  Beginning first with the lightly charred crust - sturdy and smoky with a great chew - and moving next to rich and lightly brined chevre I was immediately impressed by the quality of the base and moving on to the trio of offal things only got better as the creamy melting liver, briny blood sausage, and onion-laced crumbly pork all melded into a complex flavor that was at once mineral and pungent but also slightly sweet thus preventing it from being overly rich.  Terrine of Mousse of Foie Gras served w/ Brioche:  My first course of the prix fixe was a nearly 2 ounce slice of creamy foie gras topped with Hawaiian black sat served with golden brioche, greens lightly dressed in vinaigrette, and three dots of reduced Balsamic.  A very traditional preparation, particularly next to the pizza, this was my third foie gras course of the day and although the least 'unique,' a very smooth and well sourced product served in surprising portion for a $40 prix-fixe.  Pied du Cochon with Brussels Sprouts, Mustard Seed, and Smoked Bacon:  For our main courses Aileen opted for the Steak Frites while her sister chose the Dover Sole Meuniere and while I didn't taste the former but quite liked the simplicity of the later I was more than happy with my choice of two flaky pastry shells stuffed full of crispy trotters alongside caramelized sprouts and a sauce of smoked bacon and fresh mustard seeds.  Intense and savory, well balanced with the pungency of the sprouts, and just a touch of earthy heat from the mustard this was another bistro style dish slightly reimagined that impressed even despite my overall distaste for mustard, an ingredient that here acted to enhance the salty pork rather than mute it as is sometimes the case.  Daily Gnocchi with Onions, Belly Bacon, Taleggio, and Cream:  For $8 this was an absolute steal of a side dish as there were no less than fifteen tender dumplings swimming in a pool of bubbling cheese and cream tinged with bacon and onions.  Admittedly getting full at this point in the day, particularly as I'd eaten 3/4 of the pizza myself plus a few slices of bread I made sure I finished each dumpling, particularly those where the cheese had browned to form a bit of crunch, but I still regret sending a good portion of the creamy cheese mixture back to the kitchen rather than applying it to another slice of baguette.  Tarte Tatin with Vanilla Bean Gelato:  My prix fixe dessert, and another enormous portion, was this rustic apple tarte tatin with buttery caramelized apples juxtaposed against a crisp pastry shell alongside drizzles of crème anglaise, salty caramel, and a tuille cup filled with rich vanilla bean gelato.  Now three for three in the frozen confection department this was a lovely representation of \"French Apple Pie\" and while I still prefer America's take on the dish this was certainly a memorable dessert teaming with butter and not overwhelmingly sweet.  Chocolate Mousse Tower with Berries, Espresso Crème:  Having joked with James that it seemed odd not to serve the dish that Chef Gross prepared with Julia Child as part of her tribute menu he had to agree but for $10 extra it would have been foolish to pass on this lovely cylinder of white and dark chocolate stuffed with light chocolate mousse and berries as a supplemental dish.  Topped tableside with a light espresso cream and nicely balanced with fresh blueberries, strawberries, and blackberries against the lightest chocolate tones of the evening I can certainly say this dish is worth the praise it receives and a great deal of impact on the palate for something so light,"}
{"text":"As a HUGE Broncos fan, I gotta say I was pumped to see the huge orange Crush sign out front of Christopher's Restaurant/Crush Lounge. Definitely got my attention right away! We stopped in for drinks and nibbles and everything was amazing! Brent behind the bar served us up some stiff and extra-dirty martinis and we also ordered the Merguez Sausage with Cous Cous (rustic and spicy!), the Tempura Calamari (thick and flavorful!), and the Terrine of Hudson Valley ABC Foie Gras & Pedro Ximenez Reduction (out of this world!). It was the perfect stop to make before a night out on the town!"}
{"text":"ALWAYS my favorite....and try Sunday brunch.  The best bargain in town!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch today. Beautiful Foie Gras Torchon and Rabbit salad! The profiteroles for desert were to die for too! Our server Phillip took very special care of us. Definitely will come back, excited for more."}
{"text":"This place used to be a favorite.  The food is very good but the portions are rather small for the price.  I'm all about presentation but don't comprise the size of the meal so much just to make it pretty.  Their lobster pot pie used to be huge and look like an actual pot pie with tons of veggies and lobster but the \"updated\" version is a quarter of the size and looks nothing like a pot pie.  It is simply a piece of lobster tail with a tiny pastry puff on top and no more than ten pea size carrots and potatoes, for 40 bucks!! Don't get me wrong, It is a great spot and the food is delicious but I think they need to increase portion size or lower their prices a little."}
{"text":"Located among shops and other restaurants. Classy, upscale steakhouse.  MUST start with the roasted red pepper soup-it is divine!   I had the hanger steak which was excellent."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch here was a great experience! I had the croque madame and the other meal we ordered was the express lunch for $20. Which included roast red pepper soup, which I'm not generally a fan of red peppers, but this was yummy, mushroom and cheddar burger, and the chocolate mousse tower! I ordered the gateau marjolaine-layers of crispy wafers and mousse with a brandy snap basket on the side, filled with a wonderful, rich chocolate sorbet. So good! Definitely one of the best restaurants in Phoenix! The service was also really great, which makes the whole experience much more enjoyable. We also got to actually see the chef, Christopher Gross, cooking in the kitchen and he was very friendly. We'd totally recommend this, great food, good service. Definitely coming back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent french inspired food.  Best duck I've had in this town. Atmosphere is nice however the booths are a bit dated.  Service was fantastic.  Only downside was the bread on the table. Should be warm and more fresh."}
{"text":"I went to Christopher's for Happy Hour on a Thursday night.  We sat at the counter area by the open kitchen.  The advantage sitting by the kitchen is that you get to sample food from the Chef.  Can't beat that!  They have a good selection of pizzas, flatbreads, wines on their HH menu.  I had the Wild Mushrooms Shallots & Arugula, which normally is $16 but its $8.  You get a full pizza loaded with arugula and mushrooms.  Pizza was on a thin crust and crunchy. The sweet potato fries needed dipping sauce.  It was good, but tasted that it has been sitting in the heat lamp.   The service is sincere and friendly, but can be slow at times.  Christopher's is a very charming place for those looking for an eclectic experience."}
{"text":"Went there to celebrate my wife's bday. The food was terrific. My wife and I both had the scallops (not very original, I know, but I didn't know she was ordering those, too!). The rest of the family had an assortment of tasty chicken and lobster dishes. The waiter was very amenable, and suggested a fine not-too-expensive wine. The BEST was the starter: The Bread. The bread was terrific, and was best w/out any butter or oil. Just plain, unadorned, tasty bread. Scrumptious. I know it's supposed to be a Franco-American resto, but to me it seemed more modern American."}
{"text":"Great place and delicious food... Nice monday special 1/2 off in wine by the glass. We started at the bar... have some wines and some apps... highly suggested the foi gra with the egg and the tempura bacon!!! I'm sure is very high in cholesterol but its worth it! Then went to the restaurant to have dinner  we sat at the open kitchen area. The staff (cooks) were not too friendly... they hardly talked to each other while working...That is not fun! I loved everything that we ordered except for the calamari... the worse I have tried in my life... but highly suggested the Lobster pot pie and the Grand manier Souflle... I can;t wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Dinner was phenomenal!  My friend had the scallops that were \"out of this world\"good! Also enjoyed an arugula salad with beets that was great.  The only question I have is, why haven't I dined here more?"}
{"text":"So much potential, yet the result is awkward and kinda drab.   Sat at the tiny bar and ordered a slew of appetizers, wine, and cocktails.  The garlic fries were very good. The burger was average and the escargot were overwhelmed by garlic & butter. Our cocktails were decent, but at an establishment that portrays itself as upscale, the experience fell flat.  Their wine list is one of the best in the area, but I just dont see myself coming back as the dinner menu isnt all that motivating."}
{"text":"Don't tell anyone Christopher. But I have a serious crush on you and your elegant eatery and your fabulous Crush Lounge. This could rival my Scott Baio crush in the 70s. Or my crush on arrugula, beet and goat cheese salad in the 80s. Or even my 90s crush, yep, again, Scott Baio.   We were greeted by a lovely host person who gave us the 411 on our dining options. We chose the restaurant kitchen bar which had happy hour prices on food and drink. No sooner had Rickie and I bucked up to the bar did we have our server take our drink order: two iced teas and a large flat water. Soon to follow was some delicious pillowy yet crunchy French bread with a ramekin of soft buttah!  While we waited for our food it was most entertaining watching the kitchen staff prepare for what was sure to be a very busy Valentine's weekend. And since I was already with my Valentine, I was most happy.   We had a delicious cheese plate with herbed chevre, Manchego, Pecorino Romano and a mild cheese I won't even try to spell. I had a crispy, creamy pizza with goat cheese, roasted garlic and oven dried tomatoes. Very good though I kept thinking of my favorite flat bread delight at St. Francis. Hmmm...Rickie had a burger he enjoyed though the top bun was very doughy and not pleasant to eat. Yam fries were tasty though a dipping sauce would have been fun. All that was only $36!  Now. Is it just me but does every new restaurant try to out do the next guy with the jazziest bathroom sinks? Well, I'd have to say, Christopher's takes home the gold. A huge communal sink with a wall in front of you that shoots out water below as you rub your hands over hundreds of little rocks. Enjoyable!   And now in the 2000s I have a new crush. And it's a sink. Sorry Scott.   OMG...I think I just finished my 400th review! Cheers my yelpitas!"}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM! They have great cocktails, great staff, and the foie-gras pizza is TO DIE FOR (despite the $24 price)! I had a bad experience there once and the manager called and asked that I come back for a comped dinner.  I find that type of customer service SO rare but definitely brought me back many times!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with Christopher's and so were the two others with me.  The price point is higher than other places I have dined where I received exceptional service.  I have experienced better food and service in less expensive restaurants.  I had been looking forward to my dining experience.  I ordered from the restaurant week menu.  I selected onion soup.  I would review that the soup was okay but, I have had better onion soup or French onion soup.  Also, I noticed an unusual flavor in the soup.  I am not sure what it was.  The server said he was going to see if he could identify it but, he never got back to us.  I ordered sea bass for my next selection.  It seemed that I received a skimpy portion of sea bass for the price.  I had to eat a lot of French bread or I would have left hungry.  Another guest at my table also ordered the sea bass and both of the two portions received were larger than the one portion I received.  My other guest received two portions of sea bass because, a curly human hair was found strung in her meal and she did not find any of this to be appetizing.  The presentation of the meal is not great if you are finding hair in your food.  I wondered if they could start using a hair net or a hat in the kitchen.  The long kinky hair that was found in her meal was not the color or texture of her hair either.  The server had a second piece of fish prepared.  However, it seemed like it was from a scrap selection because it had a lot of dark matter and some areas with an odd texture.  It was not the best piece of fish that could have been selected.  Furthermore, we all wanted to enjoy our meals together.  It was disappointing that I was finishing my dish as the replacement meal was arriving to the table.  I would expect better service, presentation and consideration from an establishment with the price point that Christopher's has.  The dining experience should be marvelous and so should the food.  The restaurant is asking for a premium and we should be getting a premium dining experience.  The French bread was good but, I really did not come to dine on a bunch of bread.  The last course was a mini two piece cheese plate with a sample of honeycomb and more bread.  I want a good experience for the kind of money Christopher's is asking.  The dining room was comfortable.  The restaurant was somewhat busy but, it was not packed with people.  Overall, it was very disappointing and especially with consideration with the value of the meals for the amount received and the price paid."}
{"text":"Good spot to grab a drink if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it nor am I ever excited to go here. Its usually pretty dead so you don't get much of a vibe and the outside area is just bad - you're literally in the mall parking garage. The inside bar seating is also awkward as it all lines the walls so its tough in groups unless someone wants to sit on a foot rest stool.   The food is good but again, the restaurant is always pretty empty so you don't get that good \"date night\" vibe you want for the amount of money you're going to spend eating at Christophers."}
{"text":"We all came here for restaurant week and not only was everything delicious, the were tolerant of us playing Cards Against Humanity even.  We're classy like that,  I started with the Panna Cotta of Creme Fraiche with Christopher's Smoked Salmon and Duncan Farms Greens.  Phenomenal!  I love smoked salmon and can never turn it down, but the panda cotta made it even better if that's even possible!  Next I had the Mousse of Scallops with Lobster Sauce.  This one tasted great but the texture was a little strange.  I think I would have preferred seared scallops rather than a scallop mousse but that wasn't my choice tonight and I love scallops as much as smoked salmon.  Lastly, I had the Sole Meunière.  Wow!  Not only was it delicious, it was a huge portion.  Sarah H ended up taking some of hers home with her. A few people at the table ordered desert and I think I had at least one bite of everything.  What a sweet way to end the meal.  I understand the Christopher's has a wine dinner once a month and I'm looking forward to trying one of those next time."}
{"text":"Reserved the restaurant on Yelp and got a confirmation email that the reservation was accepted.  Received a call from the restaurant that the Yelp reservation system was not up to date and that they couldn't accommodate my request.  Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Was honestly hoping for more given all the 5 star reviews.  I did see a trend in  several of the reviews around spotty service and that is a fair description of our experience.  Maybe overall deserves 3.5 stars but I just couldn't round up to 4.    Hosted a dinner for about 16.  Had a nice location in one of the private rooms.  Would have liked a few more options for starters as it's nice to have some table food while everyone is getting settled, chatting, having a drink, deciding on mains etc.  We ended up ordering the a few of the charcuterie platters (eh, ok - would skip it next time) and a few of the bacon shallot pizzas (very good) to snack on to start.     Salads and mains covered the full gamut - salmon, scallops, duck, lamb and steaks.  I had the scallops for main and they were OK - nothing great - just very average and nothing to distinguish from many other scallop dinners I've had.   Feedback from the rest was similar - food was fine but none really blown away by the dining experience.    As noted above, service somewhat spotty - felt like there were long gaps at times and with a group of 16, someone usually needs a refill, refresh, etc. so the visits should be more frequent.  Overall just felt somewhat unfulfilled.  A bill for 16 ($1600+) comes with a large gratuity so feel like the service should reflect that."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing. We ordered the \"duck two ways\" and the \"lobster pastry\" and they were definitely really good. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Time melts like fresh peach ice cream with balsamic glaze ....  It feels like not a moment has passed since we sat at the open kitchen bar at Christophers and I first tasted a sample whipped up just for me....   I had come the previous weekend from the inaugural foodie fest at Las Vegas' Venetian, where I'd tasted balsamic glaze over a beautiful ripe fig. When we were sitting there at Christophers talking to the chef and he said wait till you taste this: that's when he handed me that peach ice cream spoonful. I held it up while he drizzled with the dark glaze. \"You're going to love it.\"  And I did.   That was more than eight years ago, before I became a yelper. We frequented Christopher's for a while and enjoyed some terrific meals.   I'm sorry to have walked by the other day to find that the restaurant has closed, but thankfully, chef Christopher Gross can be found nearby...at the kitchen at Wrigley Mansion."}
{"text":"Come here for happy hour. That is all.    Ok, that isn't all... come on. The husband and I came here for happy hour and it was lovely! We sat at the kitchen bar and got to watch them cooking all of the food, which was neat. (we also got to see the chef use a laser pointer to call his waiters... heh). They start you with delicious house made bread and butter... so good. For happy hour we had the cheeseburger with cheddar and bacon (7$) and the goat cheese and garlic pizza (7$ ish), a glass of wine (4.5$) and a beer (4$ ish). The burger looked great, but tasted just ok.... it wasn't anything terribly special. The pizza was delicious! It had a ton of goat cheese on it, big chunks of tomato, and perfectly roasted garlic... the pizza was a real winner. I would come back for the pizza for sure. If you are looking for a good happy hour, stop looking and check this place out.   PS they have a cute tapas menu now that seemed really nice, I would like to try this sometime too."}
{"text":"~ Christopher's Guide to Etiquette & Comportment ~  Always greet your guests by cooly asking if perhaps they have a gift certificate. Never share pleasantries or offer the night's specials. This helps guests feel unwelcome and unsure of what the chef is serving. Likely, they will then be eager to prove that they are worthy to breathe your rarefied air, and full of wonder and excitement at the mysteries that await them.  When the restaurant is empty, leave your guests to sit all night in quiet contemplation and prayer. It is more important to feed their souls than their bellies.  Lobster pot pie should be served lukewarm and with a steak knife. If guests are stout enough to carve the lobster, they are most certainly hooligans. Firmly direct them to the nearest ethnic restaurant.  Adjectives are vulgar. Scallops are therefore potentially the most noble of dishes. In texture, temperature, freshness, taste, and presentation, scallops should be purified of any describable features.   Guests will show their appreciation for your culinary artistry by sending all the food back untouched. You wouldn't eat a Monet, would you? Under no circumstances should you suggest a different dish, nor should you offer to comp their bill.   It is polite to promise to bring the manager to the table, but ill-advised to actually do so. Your guests are famished, and you do not want to get in their way.  The cheque should be wildly inflated. It is your patriotic duty to charge guests gratuity and taxes on all of the already over-priced food they sent back."}
{"text":"This is a French restaurant, the food is very good. I had the spinach cream soup to start and the fish special.  The atmosphere is clean and trendy, but for a Friday night it was pretty empty. Our server appeared rushed, and they would not accommodate my diet on the tasting/wine paring menu (I don't eat red meat).  Which was a bummer because that has never been a problem anywhere else.    The Crush lounge is gorgeous inside.  I would not recommend sitting outside unless you don't mind the view of the mall parking lot."}
{"text":"Had another perfect celebratory meal at Christopher's. Our waiter, Phillip, was friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and his service was exemplary. From the foie gras and mushroom soup and foie gras petit plate, to the deconstructed lobster pot pie and the veal sweetbreads, the entire experience was everything we have come to expect from this fine restaurant. Dessert of Gateau Marjolaine and Christopher's unique cheesecake, along with a good stiff espresso were our conclusions, and after bidding au revoir to Chef Christopher Gross and his marvelous staff, we left a very, very happy couple. More celebrations to come at Christopher's and Crush. Best French food in the Valley."}
{"text":"Ate here 1/19/18.  Had the chef's tasting menu with wine pairing - every course was PERFECT and so was the service.  The scallops were the best I've ever eaten.  Makes me wish I went to Phoenix more often."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere the best food in town. He is a really nice guy comes and says hi             .             ."}
{"text":"I`m coming back here for more!! Stopped in for lunch while I was out and about. Everything was fabulous!!  So much to choose from, I had such a hard time deciding on what to order- ended up getting the roasted garlic and goat cheese pizza, which was amazing!  Christopher doesn`t disappoint and I have been to his other restaurants, and this one is on my top list to return for more!  I watched some of the other dishes people ordered, wild mushroom soup, truffle fries, vanilla dusted scallops, delicious duck and a knockout chocolate tower that has my name on it next time I come back! Open for lunch, happy hour, and late night goodies, perfect!"}
{"text":"The food is good.  Place was dead.   They even called us to ask us to move our reservation earlier so that they could close at 9.  The business itself has issues.  We bought on Travelocity a $140 meal \"deal\" for $69.   When we got there, it ends up it is a limited menu, three courses with three choice each.  Actually the waiter said this is a \"sampling menu\".  When we added up the deal, even if we ordered the most expensive 3 options, it only came up to $64.  Then you take away that these were much smaller portions, it becomes clear that this certainly is not a deal.  Then they added a 18% tip.   So, food was good but business is deceptive."}
{"text":"Again another phenomenal dinner at Christopher's! We had a slightly larger group of 8 with us tonight so they put us in the semi private dining area. This little room was absolutely perfect! You got a view of the open kitchen and were able to watch the very talented chefs prepare your food. We started off with cocktails and eventually moved to wine. I do believe the group favorite was the \"Penicillin\" cocktail but their wine list is second to none! Our first bite was thinly sliced salmon with a cream on an edible spool. How fun is that?! We then moved to a few cheese plates. Very interesting to find the different cheeses you like and don't like. After came our meals. I personally had the daily scallop dish with a lobster sauce and  cauliflower. It was prepared perfectly. If you are lucky enough to try this fabulous dining (and drinking!) establishment don't forget to ask about the #chocolatetowerchallenge and see if you can compete with the best of them. Thank you for the amazing experience Christopher!"}
{"text":"Food great, service terrible.  If you want some expensive, gourmet food, I highly recommend.  Just don't expect to be waited on with any class or friendliness.  The waiter at the end of the meal spilled the entire leftover and actually began to box up the items that spilled on the floor with his bare hand.  Wow.  Hard to believe this happens, but I would not recommend, there are better options at the Biltmore for the same price and better food quality.    *I guess there's a reason why the restaurant was empty when we were there."}
{"text":"I've been to Christopher's twice for lunch and have never been disappointed.  The first time was a 'girls day' with my mom and we both had the express lunches - salad, a main course, and dessert.  The arugula salad is a fab starter, and I've had the grilled veggie sandwich and burger.  The burger was a bit dry, but still delicious.    Today I went with a friend and my two children (5 and 3).  I was a bit wary because it seems a little too high end for kiddos, but they were treated like little royalty.  Our waiter shared that he worked on a cruise line years ago, and drew little pictures on the kid's cups as well as made them these little hats out of cloth napkids.  It was so sweet!  And we celebrated my son's birthday while we were there - complete with a sparkling firecracker!  It was a great experience."}
{"text":"Saturday night..place is virtually empty..$50 lobster in brandy and puff pastry....lobster tough as shoe leather..enough said."}
{"text":"I imagine it must be difficult to provide a successful upscale dining experience in a city where it's not uncommon for $30 plates and $100 bottles of wine to be consumed by men in shorts, hawaiian shirts, and flip-flops. And yet, despite the Phoenix dress-down culture, Christopher's has redeemed a space in the snowbird jungle that will leave one feeling graced, special, and pleased to have chosen this as a romantic dining respite. Surely designed by wizards of space and style, the misting, shaded patio, lounge, kitchen-side bar, and two inside dining rooms give the feeling of old world mastery sharply clothed in new world zen. And the food? Delicious, succulent, creative, balanced, intelligent, and so on. As if all this wasn't glowing enough, the generous happy hour takes this fine food and drink experience and makes it accessible to those starving artists among us. Christopher's a restaurant that leaves me feeling grateful. I hope it does so for you as well. Cheers."}
{"text":"If this is how the French eat, I have no problem with booking a one way flight there and eating my way through the country. Sorry Rob. Been a great 8 years, promise to write, kthxbai!   Christopher's Restaurant has elevated our expectations of fine dining to a level that is dangerously high.   We started with cocktails and first courses: the sweetbread and an order of escargot. It was our first time eating either, and I'm definitely a fan of both. I also noticed we seemed to be the only ones eating our bread, and whether that's more we were just eating our way through whatever they brought out or other patrons were carb conscious, I'll never know. For our entrees, Robert order the fillet mignon and I ordered the duck; we ordered a side of gnocchi. Sweet baby Jesus! Were these the most flavorful, succulent and outrageously orgasmic cuts of meat God ever saw fit to be served? I'm thinking so, because chewing was simply a customary task and an excuse to keep the meat in contact with our taste buds that much longer. And the gnocchi, mary, was splendid and deserving of a Nobel Peace Prize.   The sheer richness of each course was overwhelming. So much so, that I couldn't finish my duck. But unlike that over-filled feeling one gets when getting stuffed, this was a pleasant sensation of being fulfilled.   I can't wait to go back, this time on a Thursday because I want to try their rabbit and see how good it is. In the meantime, I'm going to be studying French and dining etiquette so I at least appear to be refined."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for Valentine's day. It's in a great area and we had an incredible server. He was able to make great recommendations and the food was incredible. We will definitely go again. The duck and gnocchi were our favorite."}
{"text":"Expensive but man, was this food good!  I would have to eat there again to give it 5 stars, but they are certainly close.  The level of service here is definitely 5 star and the food was terrific.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who said, \"give me the best experience.\""}
{"text":"We stopped in here the other day for some happy hour apps and drinks in the lounge.  Much to our chagrin, we were ignored completely for about 6 minutes, which is an eternity when the bartender passes you to serve the other three bodies in the joint about twice each minute!  Weak, to say the least..."}
