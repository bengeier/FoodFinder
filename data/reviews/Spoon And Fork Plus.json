{"text":"Sunday lunch: à la carte lunch special ($12) or AYCE ($20)

1. Chirashi + miso soup + seaweed salad + 4 pieces of sushi 
- For $12 and 3 appetizer/sides, I thought the meal was good. The chirashi had a variety of items. I wish there was more salmon but can't complain for a lunch special. 

Overall:
- I enjoyed my meal. I've been to the Mississauga location and really enjoyed the pad thai there. I would come back to this location to try the pad thai. 
- 15% gratuity automatically added for large groups (we had 10 people) 
- Service was good. They let us split the bill and pay individually."}
{"text":"Overpriced and really disorganized - and it wasn't even busy. 

Came here for Sunday lunch \"all you can eat\" and I was hoping it would be better. We ordered our first round of food and it took 20 minutes for the first dishes to arrive. It can't possibly take a them 20 minutes to boil edamame!

Ordered 2 subsequent rounds of food and they took so long, we actually just cancelled our last round of food.  Apparently our last order was missed and the manager said it would be 15 minutes if we wanted to wait. No time - had to catch a movie at Fairview. 

Food is mediocre - nothing to rave about. Not shockingly, the portions were really small, so if you're coming with more than a party of 2 and everyone wants to try the dish, double up."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets 4*... Food is meh like typical AYCE. iPad ordering is nice except the expensive dishes are ignored like salmon sashimi."}
{"text":"I personal like the variety of cuisine they have. The veal was tender. I love the sashmi. They only thing I didn't like was the soda was not refillable."}
{"text":"Love their food. And I used to go to the one in Vaughan. But after I tried this location,I'll  NEVER go back to the one in Vaughan ever again. Because I find that the service in this location is SO MUCH better!! Much more friendly and more smile from the staffs. Just better over all. And for a AYCE place,the food is just superb!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok for the price. $28 for each and it has sashimi, sushi, steak, lamb chop, scallop, and many different kind of pasta, pad tai. With great dining environment and service. I think it worth the money which means I will bring friends come back again."}
{"text":"Amazing food and a large variety of choices. Servers were cheerful and asks how our meal was quite frequently. Only issue was the ordering pads require employees to approve the order which slows down the wait for food."}
{"text":"Lots of MSG and the food variety is very few. I won't recommend this restaurant to my friends"}
{"text":"First time in this location.  Didn't wait long to be seated.  Staff were friendly but our order kept getting misplaced and we never received some of our order.  We lost our appetite after waiting for 45 minutes for most of the food  to arrive.  They were out of desert by the time we finished our food.  Overall, a very disappointing experience. Would not go there again ."}
{"text":"One of the better all you can in I've had in a very long time!  The food came so quickly!  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and portions of everything!  I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Every single dish here is of high quality and very tasty with the exception of the noodle soup and hot & sour soup which I didn't like much. 

My favourites are the beef and chicken skewers, coconut shrimp, pad thai, green curry and grilled lamb chop. Sushi is also fresh and delicious. 

Pricey but worth it. Other AYCE places are garbage after you go here. I would rather spend a little more for the best quality and taste!"}
{"text":"Just ordered (via Uber Eats) and was very disappointed. We chose this place because of the Bento Box option which states: \"Chicken Teriyaki, gyoza, green salad, vegetable and rice\". 

We ordered two orders. The orders took over 30 minutes to prepare and we received only chicken, vegetables and rice. No gyoza (which was the draw for us) and no salad. 

On top of that the chicken was hard as a rock. We are always prepared for delivery to not taste as fresh as dine in but this was far beyond that. 

We will not order from them again. Over $50 for rock hard chicken, some rice and carrots and broccoli. Two thumbs down!"}
{"text":"this is the ultimate eating establishment for those who simply can't decide what they want.  Everything on the menu is wonderful, you have Thai, Japanese, Indian and if you need a deep fry fix...they have great chicken wings to boot.
the price is right, the Sushi is great, especially the Salmon sushi. It is my go to item here and I get it by the truckload because IMO, it will rival any higher end sushi place for it's quality and freshness.  parking is very limited however as there are a ton of other food shops in this plaza."}
{"text":"Great variety!

{"text":"We dined here for lunch and had the AYCE menu. The food was terrible. Most of the kitchen dishes came out lukewarm at best and some of it downright cold. The fried bean curd roll was so soggy and soaked in oil like it had been thrown in the fire before it even got hot. I asked two different servers 3 times before I could get some hot sauce. The final blow came when we were waiting for the server to bring the credit card machine we were looking around to find him when we saw the chef behind the sushi bar picking his nose for several minutes and flicking his boogers off his fingers all over the cutting board directly underneath him. He then proceeded to make a order without even washing his hands. We were so disgusted that we asked to speak to the manager to let him know what we had seen. To add insult to injury both of us had the runs after eating here. We will never return."}
{"text":"Probably one of the more below average experiences I've had.  I had the AYCE option which was $29.99 per person on a Saturday night.

Pros:   - Great food 
            - Great atmosphere 

Cons:  - The place was a bit warm (It was cooler outdoors)
            - The service*

We were sat down at a pretty busy time during the evening, and were told to only order appetizers to begin with (Which isn't usually the case for AYCE).  Our server, who was very sweet to begin with, started showing attitude towards my girlfriend and I, halfway through our meal.  When I ordered more than what other people would normally order, she would try to teach me a lesson by saying stuff like... \"next time, order less.\" Towards the end of our meal, when I asked for more water, she didn't even bother to turn around to talk to me, but instead looked away and said okay.  To add to the insult, we were ignored as we were leaving the restaurant.  Honestly, this ruined the night for us, and especially since I can probably get better service from any fast food joint in the area as well.

Other than that, all the other servers were pleasant to converse with, and the food was above average compared to other AYCE."}
{"text":"Generally get to go orders here and everything I have had from the sushi to the meat dishes has been great. The all you can eat menu also looks great but have never personally tried it."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with family. Eating  dinner ... looked down and there was a cockroach sitting beside me .... we were at the front sitting with my back to the window.  We had just ordered some more food ... told our server, cancelled food paid and left."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant 3 times and would rate it a 3.5.  The variety of food they have is amazing (they have everything from Japanese, to curries, etc) and so its good for large crowds if everyone can't agree to what they wanna have.

However, besides the variety, the food wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either.  I would come back if my friends made reservations here but personally wouldn't make a special trip here myself."}
{"text":"Food was decent but dessert wasn't included. For $30/person (40 after tax and tip) , I'd expect that dessert would be served as well #ripoff"}
{"text":"Great variety of food selection for an plate order all you can eat joint. However, the service is lacking because of this style of eating. Be prepared to pay $30+ a person if you are going there with friends or planning a date :)

FYI - If you are planning to come with a table of more then 4+ then to the server's eyes, you are a potential table of 12+ since you are constantly ordering throughout the time you are there so expect service to be a tad off."}
{"text":"I used to order take out from this place and it was pretty good, but they have gone downhill. I recently called for takeout and was informed they had eliminated their pasta menu, which was the best part of the menu imho.  So i ordered red curried chicken, which was not as tasty as usual. Went there yesterday for a quick a la carte with two others.  It was only 530 pm so the place was still relatively empty.  I was hard pressed to get any service, even though I kept waving as people ignored me.  When we finally sat down, we ordered salmon teriyaki, wonton soup, and some tea.  The salmon terikayi was dry and tasteless, and the wonton soup was also bland.  Our waiter was some punk who seemed like he couldnt care less, and another woman who came by to clear the table reeked of cigarette smoke. We waited forever to get change, as the owner wouldnt stop yapping on the phone.  Will not return to this overpriced, tasteless (in more ways than one) place."}
{"text":"We decided to go here on our way to pickup some groceries for the weekend. All I can say is from start to finish it was awesome. We decided on the ALL YOU CAN TASTE menu because we've never tried this restaurant before.

The iPad ordering system is GREAT.  It eliminates the need to write down a long list of things being ordered (which often led to errors or missed items) I was very happy in the selection of items for example ordering both Butter Chicken and Sashimi - or bruschetta and spicy eggplant.  All the sashimi was really fresh and tasty - and service was excellent. 

Thanks to our server. We even had a pleasant conversation."}
{"text":"I just came back for my second time today and it was just as good as it was a few years back when I first went. The sushi/sashimi was extremely fresh as was everything else. Also enjoyed clam chowder, butter chicken and grilled skewers. Very filling lunch. Don't expect any dessert for ayce lunch menu; besides I don't have a craving for sweets, so this is fine by me. I know others may expect dessert, but for the price I understand why they don't offer it."}
{"text":"Average place with lots of food options. We went on a Monday night so it wasn't too busy. Thai, Japanese and other fare including escargot.  Drinks are not included in the Ayce menu and no refills.  Each person gets 3 small dessert portions at the dinners end, which was good.  Food overall tasted ok and the sushi/sashimi a little less than average.  Maybe we'll go again but maybe not. If you want to try different types of foods than I recommend but don't expect anything to stand out taste wise."}
{"text":"Location: South side of York Mills, across from the Westin. Private parking lot can get a bit crowded.

Facility: Clean, modern, upscale and HUGE. Great for birthdays, large groups, or families. 

Food Quality & Price: $30 per person for dinner is a little on the pricey side, especially because dessert is not included. However, you can still order a \"watermelon salad\" and have that fruit as your dessert if you want something sweet. Drinks also are not included and are not bottomless. Food quality is decent with top points for escargot, sashimi and pad thai. Pasta was only okay, and some of the other appetizers were a hit and miss.

Service: Incredible speed!! After you place your order on the ipad, the food is out within 5 minutes. Are you kidding me? We went on a Friday night, starving and were NOT disappointed in the efficiency of both the staff on the floor and in the kitchen!!

Overall: I really enjoyed my experience at Spoon and Fork Plus. If I were to return, I'd do it at lunch. Not sure I'd pay $30 again."}
{"text":"I had been to Spoon and Fork in Vaughan and Etobicoke and have really enjoyed them so I was excited to learn about the new location on York Mills. We went on the second day of opening. I was curious why this was called Spoon and Fork PLUS. Turns out it is because not only is it Thai and Japanese, they also have Italian dishes and even a couple if Indian items too. It seems a bit weird to have all of this in one place but I think they feel this can justify the premium. 

Spoon and Fork is an all you can eat restaurant and as with more and more AYCE places lately, it is order off a menu - not a buffet which is nice as everything is made to order. The menu is very extensive and the food comes in appetizer size so that you can try many items. 

I personally enjoyed the high quality sushi and Spicy Rolls. Our group also liked the tempura shrimp and a number of other great dishes. The waitress was helpful in guiding us through the extensive menu. 

Overall, a very delicious meal. At $30, it's a bit more expensive that the other AYCE places in the area which are around $20-26. But I would recommend to give the place a try."}
{"text":"Delicious !  This is the BEST Spoon and Fork I have been to in Toronto.
Fresh food, great service....a great dining experience !"}
{"text":"Really is an \"all you can taste\" menu, the portions are pretty small. Good is pretty good and they have iPad ordering which is neat."}
{"text":"It was my first time here, I would say this is one of my go to places now ! We went for an all you can eat buffet during a weekday and what can I say the IPad ordering makes it so much easier than getting our food during a buffet. 
Once the food is ready the waiters will serve the food right to your table as many as you order. You would love this if you are a real foodie, imagine getting up and sitting back like 10 times to get each plate lol. 
The waiters were very friendly and polite. They kept filling up our water every time
The food overall was average. 
The must try are the beef skewers, garlic beef (main course) and the spicy salmon sushi. 
This is a very nice restaurant for a family/friend  gathering or for foodies like me !"}
{"text":"My wife and I both LOVE Spoon and Fork Plus. The staff are friendly, food is fantastic, and the experience is PHENOMENAL.

We've been going to Spoon and Fork Plus regularly for the past two years, and it is undoubtedly one of our favorite restaurants in Toronto.

Highly recommended - chances are you'll see us there :)"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise this place was! We tried to go to a restaurant in the Shops at Don Mills area but it was lined up out the door so we drove around the corner and are so happy we came across Spoon & Fork Plus! I think we have now been 4 times since discovering it a month or two ago... recommend it to anyone looking for good quality AYCE! Great atmosphere and decor. Perfect place for a bite to eat if you are staying at the Westin Prince... it's walkable and just across the street. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great service, so many choices on the menu to choose from, one of the best all you can eat restaurants I've been to having so many options you can definitely fulfill your cravings for the day. Highly recommend a lot of the appetizers. I just didn't like how the drinks weren't refillable and the desserts weren't part of the all you can eat."}
{"text":"Spoon and fork is one of the higher quality ayce sushi restaurants. Must haves include: sashimi,  sushi, escargot,  their pastas and their lamb racks. It's also a plus that they have sashimi for lunch!  Our server Ivan was attentive,  well groomed,  and prompt.  He made excellent recommendations.  

A great spot for lunch"}
{"text":"Food :

Food was same as all other ayce place. This includes sushi, curry, dim sum and tempura. A down side would be the selections of the food especially the dessert. You dont get to choose which desserts to eat and the quantity. The dessert comes with one creme brulee, one panno cotta and one jello. 

Something interesting that they offered was escargot which not a lot of ayce place offers. 

Service: 

The servers were ok, they did their jobs to clear the plates however they did not really feel as welcoming. 

Ambience:

Pretty clean and comfortable to sit in. 

Conclusion:

For the price of 30 dollars for ayce during dinner, it is worth it. However i will most likely try other ayce place that will provide more food varieties."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time last night for dinner. The place looks nice. Not a big fan of having a paper cover over the table cloth though. The food was mediocre, nothing special. I would say 3 stars describes the food best. The service was nice to begin with, but not as friendly when it got to the end for some reason. It was also a little strange that we were asked if we would want separate bills. It was just me and my pregnant wife, so a little strange no?
The food came quickly enough, I guess that's because it's an all you can eat, and they were already prepared. That's what it seemed like at least. 
I would probably try some other places in the area before going back here again."}
{"text":"Been to this place once before and it was to get some half-priced sushi and handrolls.  Just found it alright but it obviously wasn't as fresh as it would be if I had dined-in.  Then yesterday, we dined there for a girlfriend's birthday after another girlfriend had recommended the place.  She was raving about their Japanese food items especially the sashimi which was actually very good.  We had also ordered a couple of sushi and handrolls which were also good though the rice they had used seemed either a little overcooked or overwatered. 

One of the most unique things about this place is the fact that they have Japanese, Thai and Italian food.  Yes, they were all part of the AYCE menu.  There were some \"standard\" items missing from the (Japanese) menu so that was a bit surprising.  If you're like us and get fried scallops, grilled eggplant and beef with baby mushrooms, well, you won't find those here.  Also for the price you pay (+$40 with a drink, tip & tax), you don't even get ice cream. What da! 

I wish Yelp would allow us to give half stars because I'd definitely give them at least that.  As much as I did enjoy their food, I do have to just keep my rating at 4 out of 5 stars for the above mentioned reasons.  If I'm going to pay over $40, then I would at least expect some standard/basic menu items.  The baked escargot somewhat made up for it but what about those who don't eat escargot? And seriously, man, what's with the lack of ice cream?! I love ice cream."}
{"text":"japanese, thai, itallian, all you can eat.
Eel sashimi was the best, they had great entree's like lamb chops, steak and veal. Also chicken and salmon filet but those are common.

Surprised to see dim sum items, soup of the day and also the amount of appetizers they had.

Everything tasted great and the sashimi was fresh. I'd definitely go again, recommend the Eel sashimi, veal and lamb chops. MUST HAVE"}
{"text":"Had wonderful time here with some friends the AYCE tasters menu was perfect. Will be back whenever in Toronto."}
{"text":"Put my son's life in danger. I've been eating here with my son who has a severe peanut allergy since this location opened. I've always mentioned the peanut allergy and they never told me that they \"cannot guarantee that there is no cross contamination\" UNTIL TODAY. Meaning they have put my son's life in danger every time we ate there, reassuring me that they could accommodate the peanut allergy. All servers should be CONSISTENT WHEN RESPONDING TO LIFE THREATENING ALLERGIES!!! When I asked about the inconsistency all these years, the server John said because of some recent case where someone died from a peanut contamination and they don't want to be sued. So this means all these years they have been LYING to me!

Furthermore, I called ahead to make a reservation for 5 plus a high chair. When I arrived at my reserved date and time, host Jackie claims that I had no reservation. Did not apologize for their error and proceeded to put me at a table that could not accommodate a high chair. When I asked for a table that can accommodate a high chair, they said none were available. Now if the staff had done their job right and had my reservation, this wouldn't have been a problem! Worst part was the manager Alfred and host Jackie's bad attitude and unwillingness to admit fault despite their mistake. 

Horrible service and shady business practice that puts your life in danger if you have a life threatening food allergy."}
{"text":"Average quality of food. A mix of Japanese, Thai, Chinese and western food. No dessert!! Big disappointment"}
{"text":"Honestly, if there was a ZERO stars option, I would punch that in right now....  It's 30 degrees summer heat and their AC is practically off, asked multiple times to turn up the AC and they just ignore me.  For almost 40 bucks a person I think I deserve some AC and a comfortable environment to eat in.  Last time I'm coming here if is hot out!!!

STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS PLACE IF IS HOT OUT, THEY ARE TOO CHEAP TO TURN ON AC!!!!"}
{"text":"staff is friendly and we were quickly seated

we got the all you can eat, which is not bad for all the variety u get

the tataki was not the best and some sushi items did not taste the best to be honest, same with the pastas, and they don't offer dessert with all you can eat

decor is nice and its a petty place to dine in, I'm just not sure about the quality of some items"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a few years now, and the decline is noticable as of lately. It is great to have sashimi on a lunch menu, but the sizes have shrunk significantly. The sushi rice was a bit stale last week. Not sure whether this is due to summer holidays and low demand, or this is something more permanent. Will give it one more try in the fall for the old times sake."}
{"text":"My parents took me here for my birthday. I was pretty impressed by their menu as they had an array of different ethnic foods, which I was pretty excited about. However, the food was pretty mediocre and not worth the 30$ you would pay for an AYCE dinner. I would have much rather spent that money at a Brazilian steakhouse or a more expensive Japanese AYCE restaurant.

The waitresses there were pretty rude and spoke to us in a condescending tone. My mom wanted to order the lamb chop when she first took our order because it would take a while to cook. But she insisted we only start with the appetizers and soups first. We were not pleased as we are the paying patrons and should get the say, it was not my mom's first time there either. 

We ordered 4 plates of escargot, which were pretty good. Some salads, and italian pasta. The lamb chops we had asked for medium rare, but they came out medium, and tasteless. We also had some sashimi ... I've had fresher tasting sashimi at AYCE restaurant, this was definitely below par. 

We went on a Monday night, it was pretty empty, less than a quarter of the restaurant was occupied by guests. 

My family will probably not return after this experience."}
{"text":"For an ayce place, that charges $29.99 for their dinner menu, a bunch of things were wrong:
- Service was SLOW, you would lose your appetite waiting for your food to arrive
- Orders kept getting forgotten 
- They were sold out of many items but didn't tell us at the time of order 
- Food quality was average- skip the wontons, they're more like chips with hardly any filling

Overall, there are places that do ayce Asian fare much better. Skip this one."}
{"text":"This place is amazing in all aspects. The food is awesome, the staff are all friendly and helpful and the atmosphere is sleek and modern. 

They also accommodate large parties and seem to handle the ordering very well. We were there for my cousin birthday party and fell in love after we tasted their fresh sashimi (only for dinner) the portion sizes are awesome because they are not too big and this lets you get to try a lot of dishes of their iPad menu. 

Definitely a great place to take your parents are a date that likes to eat lol.

4.6 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Environment was very nice. Desserts and drinks were not included with the AYCE. The sushi were not the best I've had, but decent. Their dishes were pretty good though."}
{"text":"I rate this place 2 stars above average... 3 stars!

I ordered sushi cause it was expensive and it was good!

The sui mai was small...

To get your monies worth, order 4 orders of escargots but spread them out!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place very much.
It is a bit pricey for weekend dinner, but it was expected.
I probably would have liked it even more if I didn't come with 16+ people. 

Service is quick and the servers are extremely friendly.
The environment is very sophisticated.
I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be for a Sunday evening. 
Parking was not a hassle either.

The variety of their meals is incredible.
I tried escargot for the very first time and I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Probably the best Asian buffet in the GTA, A great selection to choose from with lots of different options. Escargot, steak, thai skewers, mussels, dim sum and sushi are some of my favourites. Orders come out fairly quick and the staff is always nice. Drinks are separate and non refillable. No dessert options but I like to do some nice sweet custard buns from the dim sum menu as a fill in when having the all you eat menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very bad service that I never see before. We order all can eat, but they delivered so slowly. And we talk to the manager, the attitude was really bad? i never see before at any restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Pricey end of Asian buffets, but worth it. My new favourite fusion buffet. I tended to stick to the sushi and fresh sashimi but they have a wide selection of curries, pad Thai, and noodles. Presentation was hit and miss. Probably not worth it if you don't eat the seafood and/or meat. 

This location lets you order off of an iPad, and the service is quite prompt. Our waitress was helpful and it was no problem to split the bill between 8 of us."}
{"text":"We have now been to this place a few times.

First time was awesome. Second time, the waitress was rude and didn't put in our entire order.

Third time was okay but the 1 ipad ordering for 10 people was quite cumbersome.

Food is jus"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Over priced by far at $40 per person AYCE, no alcohol, no dessert just bottled water. Also very manipulative by design. The service is designed to slow you down. Regardless of what you order,  you only get part and then you have to reorder again and again. They do this to slow you down as you will see as you read the reviews. Don't be encouraged by the positive reviews, they are required if you work there. They only thing they got right is the décor and the eye candy (hot waiter staff). Expensive is an understatement for what it is. We were three, my friend Roy and new friend Ricky and myself.  We had no booze, no desert, no coffee or tea, just bottled water. Our bill came to over $130 for three people. Three people, mediocre Thai for $130, get me once but not twice. Because it is an AYCE table service, they deliberately slow you down by not bringing your total order each time causing you to have to reorder repeatedly. This really impacts the over all experience, not fun.  They think you are dumb enough to believe it is an error but if you listen to the other tables around, you will hear them calling back the server asking for the missing dishes. Most important to me is the food, they drop the ball, the food boarders on mediocre and when you consider the price, you can get the same meal anywhere for half ($20) and most likely better.

All the hype for this place doesn't make sense except I would suspect it is a staff requirement to post a good review. 

I'm being very generous giving 3 stars, it can squeak through. Highly over priced. 

I changed my mind, I cant give 3 stars, it is a rip off and over all bad experience. 2 Stars is all it deserves."}
{"text":"I've always been saying that I want a restaurant that can cater to me all the different cuisines that I like, and I finally found it! Spoon and fork plus serves Japanese, Thai, Italian, and Indian food. Helllooooooo Paradise! It's a good thing they built this after I left Rogers because I'd probably have to be rolled around everywhere I go. Parking can be tricky here but ifyou go towards the back, there are tons. The ambiance is very beautiful and does remind me of the Vaughan location. There was a lot of availability for 730pm but by 830 it was getting packed. I wish I remember our waitress' name. I think it started with an M. She was so kind and attentive to us. We ordered so many different things but a few stood out. 

Don't get the wontons. My friend thought it had a filling inside but they were just crisps. Our waitress was so kind to take it from us without charging as she said other people thought the same. The steak ravioli had a strange taste and wasn't the best. The bok choy was way too salty but it was fresh. 

Now the good. I loved the beef satay with the peanut sauce. It was done perfectly and we ordered like 8. Wasn't overcooked and was piping hot. The tandoori chicken flatbread was amazing and went so well with the goat cheese. I loved the fettuccine Alfredo but not a huge fan of the chicken that came with it. And the mac and cheese was definitely on point. My a/c rolls were fresh and my friend's tuna rolls were delicious (I don't eat seafood). Since dessert is not included, we got some orders of the watermelon feta salad which was refreshing and a nice way to end off.

I wish my belly had more room cause there was so much more I wanted to try. I think I'll go at lunch next time because I can eat more then. It is pretty pricy with 30 dollars a pop but honestly the service and quality were impeccable. The portions are small so it will definitely help you from overeating. As well its a good idea to order very slowly because some of the items can be very filling. Will be coming back here again for sure"}
{"text":"We went this past Friday. It was our first time there. As people have stated it's an Asian Fusion (Chinese, Thai and Japanese and some Western options) restaurant with a choice for either AYCE or A La Carte. We decided on AYCE. The food was not bad but nothing exceptional. We had better sushi and sashimi in other Sushi restaurants. Their Thai food like Peanut Curry Chicken and Shrimp were really good. It might be a better to order these dishes in a la carte. Plus I think that it's a bit pricey with $30 per person before tax."}
{"text":"Great place go there often! Great green curry with ship! The sashimi is also very good."}
{"text":"Service
We had superior service in the beginning. Our waiter was friendly, outgoing, great at talking and so easy to interact with. The tablet was nice and easy to use. It actually has one of the better layouts (probably thanks to the software) for ordering. Gosh, we were having such a good time until halfway through the restaurant became busy and all the waiters disappeared. It took us so long to get our bill, like 10 minutes? Dude, all you are doing are serving dishes (and that's not even the waiter's job). We asked someone who was serving to get us the bill and he quickly told us that he was not a waiter. Well you know, maybe you can ask someone to help us. I don't know how the tipping system works but they lost so much here. When we finally waived a waiter to come, he nodded but there were so many tables before us who wanted to leave too. In the end, I'm assuming it was the manager who came over and took care of it. But shit...hire more people.

Food
Lots of variety, no doubt. Food quality is a little below average but the presentation is great (good job). Portions are TOO big for an AYCE restaurant. When we ordered butter chicken, we weren't asking for a full size bowl of rice. And when we order fried rice, we aren't asking for the dish to feed 3 people lols. I know that some buffet-style restaurants are looking to fill you up but this is such a waste. Your restaurant offers so much variety, why don't you be nice and let us taste a bite of each? Maybe it's a great strategy to save money but dude, it turns people away.  Dessert is extra - really?  Are you really going to do this to your customers? Lol.

Recommendations:
- Escargot
- Skewers
- Seafood
- Most of the appetizers are okay (I like the crispy chicken)

Stay away from:
- Sushi
- Dim sum"}
{"text":"Fusion restaurant that is similar to spring rolls except probably a better version. It offers Asian food along with a few western food like pasta, but it is predominantly Asian food. 

The biggest feature is that this place is all you can eat. With tip and tax, it comes to 25 per person for lunch. However, unlike other all you can eat place, you can order unlimited salmon sashimi which is quite rare.

Not only you can eat sushi, but you can also eat dim sum. I wouldn't recommend that they have the best dim sum but at least it is a choice. They have pretty good sushi although their spicy tuna sushi is quite cheap. There is virtually no tuna.

You order your food via an iPad. Be sure to order the appetizers."}
{"text":"The absolute worst!! DO NOT EAT HERE!!! Waited over an hour and they only brought us out rice and noodles for the AYCE. Table of 5 and they could not accommodate bringing out our food that we ordered. When finally confronted the waitress she was clueless to what happened to our order. She said maybe some other table took it??? Than she got that horrible rude front supervisor. Who was condescending, saying he wanted to find out what the problem was and tried to touch my shoulder like he was my friend. I swear if he touched me I would have called the cops and have him charged with assault. When he came back he didn't say what the problem was and just started throwing food on our table. Stuff we didn't order. Than was like, here is food and poured my beer into my glass causing it to foam and overflow all over the table. Then they brought out a rubber slipper covered in sauce the called chicken teriyaki... I told buddy in the front, hey you spilled my beer and the chicken is rubbery cold. He stormed over and said you want a new beer fine!! here a new beer! Your hot chicken is coming!! Like what back Alley did you find this loser?? It only got worse from there. I told the waitress I have had enough of this clown show and to figure out what they where going to charge us, reminding her that one person in our party had only received edemame beans from her order. She came back and said they can only credit one meal. I said fine I just need to get outta here. Than they tried to pull a fast one and charge me $8.95 for my beer when on the menu it's clearly marked as $7.50. Who knows how many people they are penny pinching and scamming like this. I have never in my many years of going to restaurants given no tip but it felt so good not to give one red cent more to this establishment. They need to be shut down for the worst service and food ever..."}
{"text":"-Did the all you can taste option on a Saturday night. 
-Service was bad. Food took forever to come and some people weren't getting anything according to one of the servers.
-Food was ok at best.
-Won't be back.
-That's all the effort I'm giving this review.
...oh, one more thing... if you want a laugh, place an order for the okra with a (1) for quantity."}
{"text":"Used to be one of my fav AYCE places before because of the variety of food they have available. However, our recent visit left a sour note. 

I really like the iPad ordering service because I can pick whatever I want and the amount that I want and also other people can see what you've already ordered. However what's the point of letting me order the amount when you are just going to bring me whatever you feel like. It really pisses me off, when I ordered 20 pieces of sashimi I expect 20 pieces to arrive and not 10. Not like we have a small group of ppl. It looks kind of pathetic when you being 10 pieces of sashimi to a group of 6 people. Also the sashimi and rolls/sushi came last, took forever to come. It almost feels like they wanted us to fill up on carb-filled dishes first, like rice and noodles cause those came quickly in generous portions. While protein dishes like the fish and skewers and chicken wings would come with less than half the amount we ordered. We kept ordering and ordering the sushi and sashimi but I think only one round ended up coming before we left and simply just waited too long.

Another peeve was that we made reservations and told them we had children and babies coming. Okay I understand this is not the most child friendly restaurant but we came Sunday afternoon, hopefully not ruining anyone's romantic date night. But it almost seemed like they threw us in the corner in a cramped booth, away from everyone else, while we would have been more comfortable at a table with pull out chairs. I did ask for us to switch tables, when there's obviously tables available and restaurant was not full the whole time we were there, but the \"manager\" (short round Asian guy with glasses) outright refused us not giving any reasons, but just a simple \"you are fine here\". 

On a lighter note, the server was very nice but seemed like he was avoiding our table every time we were trying to again put in a order for sashimi. I feel like it's prob because of the POOR MANAGEMENT at this place. The food is simply okay... skewers were super dry when they first came, almost like jerky and simply left more to be desired. 

I think next time Dragon Pearl!!! Prob a bit more pricey but at least I can really get as much sashimi as I want!"}
{"text":"Great place, waitress was nice and pretty too. I would recommend to all, although the price is a bit on the high side, but atleast its all you can eat."}
{"text":"First of all, great service. Good job to all the servers working there! My family came for the dinner buffet and decided to sit on the patio. The waiters we're very attentive and came to check up on us often. As the sun was setting, my dad asked them to move the umbrella to help block the sun a bit. Even though no one knew how, their attitude was great and really tried their best! We really appreciate the effort! 

Food came quickly after the placed the order on their iPad. This might be due to the fact that it wasn't busy that day. From previous experience, service was quick even on a busy day but they got quite a few orders wrong that time. 

If I can give them 6 stars I would because I completely forgot my backpack there and they kept it safe for me: ) yay!!! 

Food there is always always always yummy, it is pricier than most Asian buffets tho, but they do have more variety. Just no dessert in the all you can eat menu...whyyyy?!?!??!!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and this place is NOT as amazing as everyone says it is.  I found that the menu has a lot of chinese dishes, so maybe i'm biased because I don't like chinese food.  I would rather go to other Japanese AYCE places.  But the decor and atmosphere is MUCH nicer than your typical AYCE sushi restaurant.  Dish presentation is nicer as well.

hilights for me - California and watermelon salad, satay skewers (a little on the salty side though), green dragon roll (SO GOOD), tempura (eggplant and sweet potato), pesto pasta (there's some random italian dishes at this spoon and fork).  I don't eat raw fish but their sushi looks super fresh and much better than your typical ayce restaurant.  

notes - if you're into escargots or french onion soup, then this place is legit.  A full portion like you would get from a regular restaurant.  I don't know any other places that have this on a buffet menu. Also, there is NO dessert included, which really sucks in my opinion."}
{"text":"Honestly i would have gave this place 5 stars if they had the menu they used to have.  They got rid of all of their main dishes which gave them much more variety. They ended up replacing it with a bunch of peanut curry sauce dishes which was not that great. This place used to be my favourite place to go along with a few of my friends. Ended up going and being very disapointed. Don't get me wrong the food is still great. But not as great as it used to be unfortunately."}
{"text":"The food here is OKAY. Nothing special or grabbed my attention. The rolls were good, the pastas were good. Didn't like any of the seafood, nothing tasted very fresh. The steam food were probably my favourite. There were quite a bit of vegetarian options, although nothing unique. The normal sweet potato , cucumber, avocado rolls and pastas without meat. 

Dessert doesn't come with the AYCE, which was really dissapointing. We ordered a sweet cream bun which came with the normal menu to make up for it. 

The price was about $25/person for a weekday lunch. I thought that it was ridiculously expensive, especially without dessert. 

I came as a group of 15, so I expected our service to be somewhat presentable and messy. The staff was awkward, and didn't smile the whole time we were there. As many as the other reviewers have mentioned they got orders wrong and forgot to bring certain dishes. I get that we were a big group, so I didn't try to make a big deal."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday evening with a large party.  Other than the fact the orders between our 2 tables got mixed up. The food was amazingly good.  I personally enjoyed the different cuisines - really liked the veal marsala.  The sashimi was fresh and rolls were tasty.  It is a bit on the pricy side. But we will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Food: 0.5/5 Service: 1/5 Positive reviews: outright lies

I am absolutely furious at the disservice the positive, and likely fake or insincere, reviews for this restaurant cause. 

To note, as I write this it is 4:40am on a Tuesday morning. The reason for this is that the previous evening, I had dined at the AYCE for ~30$ and was served the worst sushi I have ever had, bar non, paired with the worst service at any restaurant I've ever experienced across 14 countries over 30 years of my life. Now I'm unwell. And this is not hyperbole. Nor is this an unrestrained review, I am holding back for the sake of propriety.

The food: was not fresh, not sushi grade quality, and was very obviously slapped together in some crude fashion (see attached images). Not only did it look like whomever made the main rolls did not know what they were doing, but it was apparent that they were trying to con us --the rolls only had fish a quarter of the way through, the bottom half+ was hollow!!!!!!!!! The sashimi was oddly moist, WARM, and a sliver of a morsel (see attached). The first few times, I gave them the benefit of the doubt. But it was apparent that it was intentional. The soy sauce was in a drip bottle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you did not vigorously shake the bottle, you would sit there as it slowly dripped out. Are they mad!? They present themselves as an upmarket sushi restaurant, but force you to make an arse of yourself pouring SOY SAUCE??? And what's rich is that when we inquired about a low sodium soy sauce option, the owner himself stated rather frankly that they water the soy sauce down so it's low sodium by virtue of the water in it. And from the colour, just a bit darker than tea, he was being honest.

Never have I seen such outrageous attempts to cheat someone in my life! It's Pacific Mall's essence manifested in a restaurant: Cheap knockoffs being pushed by crooked, dishonest, and greedy merchants. 

The service: without exception, the worst I've had for the price ($80/2 people). The owner himself sat us down, then proceeded to condescendingly inform us of what AYCE was, and how to operate a primitive iOS menu app. He was talking about it as if he was trying to explain to an imbecile which orifice to insert food into! As mentioned previously, he also said the soy was watered down and implying that thus it qualified as \"low sodium\", and before we had given any indication that we doubted him, he challenged us with an offer to go and fetch the bottles from the back for our inspection. I'll leave that there.

The waiting staff were a total of two for what was approximately 50-70+ diners. Once more, not hyperbole. Again, a sign of distasteful frugality --the last characterisation you would want where you eat. As it used an ipad menu, food options were keyed in. However, unlike every other AYCE sushi place, the waiting staff or owner would have to come and enter a confirmation code. Only afterward would your order go through. So, what should have been a convenience, quickly became a nightmare. We would order food, thinking it was being made, but in fact nothing had gone through. We would sit and patiently wait, and after the first 15 minutes or so, would inquire after our meal, only then to be told that 1 of 3 people could confirm it and that in fact nothing had gone through. Learning quickly, we would key in our subsequent selections, and try to get them to confirm it promptly. But they seemed to actively avoid our table. I say this because the cash machine was directly behind us, and we tried to get their attention multiple times. At one point, one of the servers noticed we were trying to get her attention, and the owner seemed to hold her back and direct her to a non-AYCE table. Paranoid? Hardly, when we asked the owner why he needed to confirm the order earlier, he rudely spat, and I quote verbatim, \"because otherwise customers would order and order and I would go bankrupt\" (what's missing is the heavy Chinese accent, but otherwise word for word). 

Taken together with the unsatisfactory, sloppy, outright bad sushi, and the service, I was fuming.

To summarise, it was down right terrible overall and the positive reviews (especially the \"elite\" reviewers) might well be paid or from a review farm given how alarmingly inaccurate they are. This from someone who worked in the social media marketing industry."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday for dinner service and I have to say I was unimpressed.  I was late arriving for dinner and I walked into the restaurant and thought the place was nicely decorated, extremely busy for a weekday so I was somewhat excited to try the food.  I sat down and was told it was all you can eat and was handed an ipad to order whatever dishes I wanted.  They have a variety of different foods from Italian to Japanese to Chinese food, pretty much a mish-mash of everything.  After a couple minutes of waiting, the waitress finally processed the order for my food.  I waited a while to get a glass of water served to me, in which I had to ask the waiter myself and on top of that he had given me so much attitude when I asked him.  After a couple minutes, my food arrived.  I ordered a Seafood Casserole (which I do not recommend), it was tasteless with watered down alferado sauce.  I also ordered the Escargots which were not bad in my opinion (probably the only thing I would order twice on that menu).  I also ordered some Sashimi and tried some of their Sushi Rolls, but wasn't too impressed because the Sashimi did not taste fresh.  Overall, I'd say they have a good variety of food but everything was mediocre and nothing stood out to me.  The cool thing at the end of dinner is that they give you hot water in a Sake glass and these little dried towelettes, in which you pour water on and expand.. How funny is it that I found this the most intriguing thing of the restaurant.  Not the food, but the towelettes.  I must also warn you that they charge for refills and dessert is not included in the all you can eat dinner.  Lucky for us, we had birthday cake that my friend brought to the restaurant.  The dessert was probably my favourite thing out of the whole dinner.  My friends and I all agree we are not coming back here, especially for the price we paid for the quality of food. This restaurant deserves a Fork off!"}
{"text":"1 star for the rude male greeter/manager who seemed to have a chip on his shoulder. He really shouldn't be the first point of contact for customers. Almost made us want to turn around and leave. But I really wanted escargots....so we stayed. Our visit was on a Thursday at 1pm for the ayce lunch.

If you can get past the front door, you're sure too enjoy the food. I must say that though the selection is small, they have improved the quality. The sashimi was fresh and the Thai red/ green curry shrimp was REALLY good! Of course the highlight for me was the ayce escargots. The real only reason for my visit. 

I think they hired new wait staff as well.  This batch was more friendly and charismatic than the last time I was here.

Tip for the owner: keep up with the standard of your food, recognize your wait staff and get rid of the manager who  is souring the customer's experience at your restaurant."}
{"text":"The manager was rude.I was with my whole family to celebrate my mom's bday that night.When we got inside i asked for a table of ten including kids,while waiting one of the fixtures beside the entrance fell into my 3 yr old nephew.Instead of asking if the kid was ok the manager started yelling at us and he told us that we should pay for it.I told him that thing was flimsy and its not the kids fault but he kept on yelling at us.My nephew felt bad he thought it was all his fault.Thats when we decided to left and take our business somewhere else.I've been to spoon & fork vaughan same bad experience.Food's great but customer service was sh@t.S&F york mills you should fire your manager,this guy doesnt know anything bout cx service.He does not represent the company's core values."}
{"text":"Damm... this place was not what I've expected as to the ratings I've read.

I booked a table for 8 people for dinner on New Years Eve - Called and Spoon & Fork Plus had space which was amazing because I thought everywhere would be booked up. Originally wanted to go to Dragon Pearl Buffet but it was full so settled for this instead since it is a new place and it doesn't hurt to experience new places! :)

Came in, and the place was all fancy looking and quite nicely decorated. We came in slightly earlier for our reservation and everything was smooth.

I guess this is where it goes downhill. Not really the restaurant's fault but we were seated at the booths and the booths were connected to the other table. The booth connected to us had a little kid that kept jumping up and down which was annoying. 

For an AYCE though, they do have tons of different options which I liked - especially the pasta options. However, being diverse, they certainly didn't excel in any of the food. The pad thai was pretty flavourless to me and the Japanese food/sushi wasn't anything special. Since it was an ayce, I didn't expect the quality to be good, and no doubt that I only liked the linguine dish (forgot the actual name) and I tried about 4 different pastas options. The miso soup also tasted odd. 

Service was pretty non-existent, after our waiter served us water, that was pretty much it and no one really attended to us. We also had to call our waiter everytime we submitted our order, and it was hard to flag down a person... It was only at the end that he refilled our water when we called for the bill since he had to wait for payment anyways but thanks for trying..

Also don't get why there was so much space on the sushi places - they couldhv fit more of our sushi dishes together onto one plate but I guess it was all about presentation. Our table was filled with food and had no space at one point... The food arrived promptly but they DEFINITELY MISSED a lot of our orders - including the escargot and since waiters are hard to get, we just kept ordering more but still, none showed up at all!! & according to the reviews, the escargot was good and I was looking forward to that... Also ordered the Sirloin Steak and Teriyaki beef which came in one huge piece and they did not provide knives... tried to bite the meat but even then it was hard and not chewy aka disappointing.

PS: there was NO dessert menu for the AYCE! Which was disappointing again because for the price they've set at, I'm sure they could have accommodated to a dessert menu.

Since we were a big group, the service charge was already added in to the bill... With no dessert or excelling in any of the food (especially thai or italian since they're not usually in AYCE), I rather go somewhere else that is good in their speciality cuisine (eg: Japanese) and offers dessert due to the value in price."}
{"text":"In terms of buffets, there are plenty that are superior. There was nothing astonishing to make me return. The selections were weak, and to add insult, dessert is not included in the price of the buffet."}
{"text":"Never got seated at this establishment after walking in and waiting several minutes. No acknowledgment of my presence. No greeting.  Took the time to look over the menu while waiting.  This restaurant was recommended by the Bellman across the street at the Westin Prince where I sway often on business.  Got tired of waiting and went next door to have Italian instead - which turned out to be a great meal!"}
{"text":"Good food but recent price changes are way beyond reasonable.
Used to pop in for take-out of $10 entrees.   Called to get take out today and was told prices on the website were wrong but prices just raised slightly.  When we arrived to pick up was surprised at the bill:
-   Ginger chicken was $10 , now $14...... a 40% increase
-   Cashew chicken was $10, now $15..... a 50% increase
-    Mango salad was $6, now $8 .... a 33% increase.

I understand raising prices as costs go up but really?    This is beyond reasonable so won't be going back."}
{"text":"Dissappointed is all i can say. This place used to be slightly better. I thought after not trying for a few years i would come and try. It is pretty expensive for a dinner meal and i expected something at least above averagem all i got was a restaurant where you can tell the owner is trying to cut corners and be cheap whenever possible. First of all the buffet option. The food was subpar at best. With sushi that looked nothing like the picture on the ipad. And thats cause they put as little fish as possiblr and pad on massive rice to try and fill you up. Also when you order items that actually cost money like sashimi. They will give you less the half lf your order and makr you order non stop. Which you can do efficently becausr you need to find a waiter. The cooked food portion was mostly all bad for a variety of reason. Such as overcooked. Underseasoned. Or straight up just not even the right flavour or look. The last part that is ridicoulous to show their cheapness is all other all you can eat sushi joints offer as many deserts as you want. And a great variety. They allow only 1 per person. And 3 medicore deserts. They had also gotten our check wrong 3 times. I would place this in not only not recommend but avoid like the plague. It is by far one of the worst ayce japanese in toronto."}
{"text":"I do t usually give 5 star but this restaurant is very good on service and food. The waiter know how to social with us. The food is be tasty. The atmosphere is very nice. Even the dessert look very decorative. We are having a Christmas party here and we are also having a good time."}
{"text":"Japanese, Thai and Italian? How exotic of a restaurant. 

I came here last night with a group of 9 and everyone of us enjoyed our meal. 

The food quality is excellent especially considering it's an all you can taste restaurant. 

It costed 28.99 per person on a weeknight, plus beverages, plus desserts, plus tax, 15% tips ( automatically charged with groups of 8 or more ) 
If you're interested, we paid 460 for a group of 9. 

Ginger tea goes great with all you can taste dinners. 

Even though I gave a 5 star review, I must admit they need to improve their dessert game."}
{"text":"My friends and I love this restaurant! Every time we go there we always had the AYCE option. We were there today at lunch to celebrate my bday and we had a great dining experience there. The escargots with small French breads were exquisite and so addictive. Their watermelon salad is refreshing and perfect for summer. Everything from their Japanese sashimi, sushi rolls, chicken & beef skewers, butter chicken with rice, Thai curry shrimps, Italian pastas and fried calamaris is mouth watering delicious. 

Some people may complain that their AYCE food portions are small, but I am perfectly content with their food portions as they are just enough to satisfy your taste buds and you can always order more if you want.  Their service is awesome, our waitress Mavis is super attentive and nice, we love her!

I'd say this is my fav AYCE restaurant and I wouldn't hesitate to go there again for my next get together dinner or lunch with friends."}
{"text":"Normally I don't write reviews but I just had to write one to warn fellow foodies out there

I'll use a 5 star rating system
5 star = Excellent, loved it! must go!
4 star = Really enjoy it, give it a try
3 star = Enjoyed it but wasn't the best
2 star = Fair, needs improvement
1 star = I will not return in my lifetime unless a miracle happens 

The atmospheres in terms of seats, tables, environment is 2/5 Star. I can see they are trying to save laundry money (they plac8e 2 paper cover on top of their table cloth) but is it really a need? with a resturant interior such as theirs you don't expect that.

1/5 Star for Food
I've attached photos of some foods, and if you are a foodie then forget about this place. 

Ordered a beef rib can let's just say..it looks and taste like the rib took a trip around the Sun, then came back to the beach on Earth to get an additional tan 

Ordered a lobster hand roll (in the picture you can see a beautiful lobster meat with avocado, fish roe) and ends up to be a piece of tempura battered meat with a hand full of rice that wasn't even properly rolled. Where's the fish roe and avocado? Spoke to the servers and they said that is the lobster hand roll altho \"it looks abit different\"....This isn't just a little different. The product isn't even the same thing. If you look at McDonald's Big Mac, even if it looks different in advertisement at least you get the same ingredients. 


Service 1/5 Star (continue on from the food story)
Afterwards, the servers took it away and empty it in their garbage been and I can hear him talking to the other sever that he doesn't even care about this complaint I just made for faith advertisement. Frankly, I think you had a long day at work. However, stating that when your customer can hear is not professional. There's no feed back given to your kitchen nor bought up to your supervisor or manager. 

The whole experience was pretty disappointing. I'll definitely not return to this location, 1/5 overall."}
{"text":"In my mind, Spoon and Fork Plus floats towards the upper end spectrum of AYCE restaurants with a focus on nice decor, an upscaled atmosphere, and speedier service using iPads for your order.

We had a family holiday dinner here back in holidays of December and I really enjoyed the overall experience.

This particular location offers Japanese, Thai, and Italian.  I think their wow factor item is the escargot that is smothered in garlic butter.  At the very least, we enjoyed it by ordering at least 10-12 dishes of it over the course of the meal.

There was a lot of choice on their all-you-can-taste menu from all three cuisine styles and browsing through the iPad made it really easy with the pictures of each menu item.  My only one issue is with the tempura basket offering which comes with a variety of tempura vegetables and tempura shrimp but there is no option for just tempura shrimp.  :-\

The food did come flying out of the kitchen and it made for room at the table a premium so my advice is to go with small orders of dishes at a time so you can smartly pace yourself.

I did enjoy the selection of sashimi on the menu and they also had some selections that had a bit of extra flourish like seasoning/herbs.

Overall, I think the experience is worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"Not nearly worth the money. Really nice atmosphere, sort of snotty and not attentive wait staff, and overall, mediocre food. After sampling quite a few dishes on the menu, the vast majority ranged from ok to alright; a couple stand outs: Thai dumplings, crispy beef, and Calamari, and lamb chops were very tasty but mostly everything else was bland completely. No soft drink refills at $30 a person? Ridiculous. Don't think we will be back, I think this place is perfect for the pretentious couple who rather enjoy over paying for cute little dishes. Not for me"}
{"text":"COCKROACH ALERT! COCKROACH ALERT! So spoon and fork plus at don mills and york mills was my go to spot good sushi and Thai/Japanese food. Aside from the poor management, we never had issues. On Monday July 4th 2017 my friend and I decided to go for dinner. Near the end of the night my friend shrieks in terror and says \"Is that a cockroach behind you?\"-- I turn around and there's a big fat cockroach staring me down. I was mortified. I called the waiter over.. who killed the cockroach and apologized but then proceeded to say that he's used to seeing cockroaches in the KITCHEN once or twice a month but never in the dining room. He said it so casually as if it was the norm. I was so disgusted. I called the manager over and asked him if he has a cockroach problem. He said no and that they have a strict pest control policy. I then told him that his waiter just killed a cockroach on my seat. The manager said \"oh sorry about that, thanks for letting me know\" and walked away. Let me point out that I've been a regular customer for the last 5 years. I was so so shocked at his behaviour. A good manager would have sincerely apologized, grabbed the bill and would have comped our meals. That's Restaraunt management 101. I'm probably never going back and will be telling everyone about my experience. The funny part is, the manager at this location, used to be a waiter at the Woodbridge location. Even as a waiter he sucked. I think what pissed me off the most is how the situation was handled. If you decide to eat at this Spoon and Fork Plus... be on the lookout for cockroaches. Then again.. their hangout spot seems to be the Kitchen! Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"The quality for the price is unmatched.  

A fusion menu with nice sized portions, served in an all you can eat format.  I was very impressed with the speed of the service and the team effort to keep the table clear and water glasses full.  

For what it is, it truest is a 5 star rating.  Anyone who gives it less than 4 would confuse me. 

The sushi is nice, decent chicken wings, great dim sum and do not skip the tataki, especially the tuna!!!!"}
{"text":"Grab and Go Sashimi box ($10)

Fresh and delicious. Says 14 pieces on the box. It's definitely more than that. More like 20+ pieces. 

2 red tuna, 3 white tuna/butter fish, 3 octopus, 3 red snapper, 6(?) salmon, 6 albacore tuna.

Lemon on the side is quite nice. Their soy sauce comes not in a pack, but in box with a lid, so you can dip a lot easier. 

Would have taken a picture, but forgot cuz I was too busy chowing down."}
{"text":"Food is quite decent but dropping it by a star because they charged my 4.5 year old $25 for dinner buffet!  Insane meanwhile Dragon Pearl next door charges about 4/5 dollars when they have a larger selection And desserts."}
{"text":"We chose this out of convenience; it was right across from our hotel.  The Thai food seemed authentic, but it also offered Chinese and Japanese dishes.   We had Satay, Karage and Crab Fried Rice.  Not bad.  Service was ok too. ** Spoiler Alert ** The most memorable part of the meal was at the end when the server poured water into a \"roll\" which turned into a wet napkin."}
{"text":"Was most appreciative of Julia's attention to my shrimp allergy. Food was fast coming out but two dishes were way too spicy and salty, respectively. Other than that, great atmosphere, comfortable seating and good service."}
{"text":"This is my second time here at Spoon Fork. As usual the restaurant is fast and efficient. :) food arrive in 10 minutes after ordering! My boyfriend and I ordered a curry shrimp with rice and a butter chicken ($12 menu). The curry was great but the butter chicken was not as good as expected.. Hence 4 star!"}
{"text":"Spoon & Fork is a solid AYCE sushi spot with lots of seating, good food, and a convenient location that's close to the highway. I've been here many times for lunch and dinner and can say with confidence that each experience was the same - not great but not horrible either. However they do have some items on the menu which I love and keep me coming back. 

The raw selection is pretty standard except you get sashimi for lunch, even octopus! The last time I was here the octopus was tender and delicious. Most AYCE places only do sushi so it's an added bonus. Lastly, their maki rolls are not overflowing with rice, so you do get some good bang for your buck. 

This location is unique in that they have Italian on the menu as well as Thai and Japanese (win!!!). I always get the escargot which comes with a buttery garlic sauce and a bit of cheese on top. Some other notable items to mention are the pineapple fried rice and the beef carpaccio (only available at dinner). I tried the mac & cheese last time and it was rich, creamy and cheesy, all the things a mac & cheese should be. 

Parking can be found right outside. Service is good however it can be hard flagging someone down when it's particularly busy such as during the lunch rush. 

They charge $3 for tea, but you get your own teapot with 2 bags of green tea."}
{"text":"Happy Father's Day 2018!

We have had lunch buffet here previously. Today however it didn't feel the same. The beef rendang tasted a little saltier. Sushi looked \"sad\" and was at par or perhaps slightly better than the store-bought sushi from Foody grocery. Their fried rice - different varieties were still spot on and delicious. Dimsum choices though limited are indeed must-orders. We always order the skewers. 

Too bad, no desserts included in the buffet. 

There are other buffets in the same plaza. The other one is a few dollars more but overall food quality including choices are better."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend for the AYCE. Sashimi, sushi and tempura were excellent. The Tandori, Chow Mein, etc were so-so. Service was fast and friendly. Establishment clean.  Price, IMO, was slightly high for lunch service by a buck or two. Overall worth a visit if you're in the mood for AYCE."}
{"text":"A buffet with Italian, Thai and Japanese, what a great place to eat? NOT!
The food was subpar, the best out of all the cuisine was Japanese. I made reservation for 7:30pm and was 15 mins late. The manager said \"you should of called us ahead or we will give your spot away\". I agree with that, however the restaurant was half empty."}
{"text":"Went there in a Friday evening for dinner. The decor is beautiful. This a great place for date night. Had the all you can eat or \"sampling menu\" for $29.99 (desert not included). I've never had Asian with Italian but this place makes it work. One thing I didn't like was the fried rice. I've had better. Everything else like sushi, noodles, pasta, and sashimi, grilled meats were great. I did try the green curry shrimp, but it's obvious that green food coloring was added to enhance the \"green\" in the curry. But it did taste like Thai green curry.  Overall, yes I would come back."}
{"text":"OMG where to begin?!?! First, don't let the location in a small strip mall scare you awSt. The restaurant is fancy yet casual in feel.

Being my first night in Toronto, I wandered in to check it out since it was across from my hotel. While I perused the menu in front, the sweet bartender brought me a glass if water. Just a quick glance at the menu and I knew I wanted to have dinner here!  I admit I was unclear about the tasting menu option. My waiter, Kyle, was great in explaining how it worked as well as making suggestions for a non-meat eater like me!

Long story short, with the tasting menu you order whatever you want for $30. Most of the portions were too large in my opinion, so I imagine there is a lot of waste. Since I was dining alone, I couldn't share a dish with others which would be ideal!

Below are the dishes I ordered:
Beet salad
Mango salad (delish)
Hot & Sour soup
Stuffed crab shell
Stuffed shiitake mushroom (delish)
Spicy tuna & spicy salmon sushi
Golden Roll (4 pieces - too big)
Butter fish takati
Spicy Basil pad Thai (delish)
Mac & cheese

As you can see above, this was an insane amount of food!  Needless to say I didn't even make it to the rice dishes (pineapple fried rice & crab fried rice were on my wish list) or main entrees (red curry Thai shrimp, spicy eggplant). My suggestion, am don't order sushi or things you know what it tastes like or you can easily get elsewhere (hot & sour soup).

One caveat, in TINY print at the bottom it states to not order an excessive amount of food and if you leave leftovers, you will be charged. My waiter mentioned it when I finished and had asked how much food they throw out. So don't let your eyes get bigger than your stomach!!  

Definitely check out Spoon & Fork Plus!!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Besides waiting so long to be acknowledged and seated, and having our server take a while to provide us any service or drinks. We ordered the deep fried wontons as an appetizer. When it arrived, it was literally just the shells (if that's what you call it). The description says deep fried wontons filled with shrimp and chicken, however this was literally just shells. Zero filling. 
We mention this to the server, and he explained that that's how they make it. We questioned why it says filled with meats, if it's just shells and began to break it a part to show how it was empty inside. He said that's how it's done and walked away? 
When he came back, he said he can take it back but he doesn't know why we broke it a part and now he can't do anything with it? What would you do even if we didn't break it a part?? 
He then asked if we would like to continue to eat here? Like we were not welcome anymore since we were not happy with the wontons?? 
We still ate our entrees which was good (salmon teriyaki) but the appetizer was not as described and the server should not be in the service industry. 
He was in a purple shirt, while the rest of servers were in black. This lead me to believe that he was in a higher position. Which in the service industry, someone higher up should acknowledge the customers concerns and provide the correct service or an alternate suggestions to reach expectations. 
Would love to know if anyone ordered the wontons and they were actually filled since ours were completely empty inside. False description."}
{"text":"Not bad! We ordered buffet items off their iPad menu. Great selection of food across many genres (Japanese, Thai, Chinese, Indian), and the quality was decent too. The food arrived quickly after we ordered it. 

The interior is nice and it seems suited for small or large groups. Most people seemed like were celebrating a special occasion. Service was very pleasant.

It was a bit expensive though ($30/adult, $20/child). You can find similar quality Japanese AYCE food for cheaper elsewhere, but the decor and atmosphere is probably nicer here, and you get a broader selection of Asian foods to choose from here too. 

Highlights were:
- beef teriyaki
- calamari
- fish red curry
- sashimi seemed fresh
- escargot

Downsides:
- expensive
- ordering from the dessert menu costs extra, not included in buffet price 

I might go back for a special occasion, but for a regular meal I'd probably stick with a cheaper Japanese AYCE option elsewhere."}
{"text":"Delicious AYCE Japanese, Thai and Italian! Wait a second, one of these does not look like the other. Italian food at an Asian restaurant? Well, it works and the Italian food was good! My twelve year old cousin stuffed the pasta down his throat as fast as he did the spring rolls and said it was delicious. He's a picky little eater too. So, A+ Spoon and Fork! My cousin was full for a whole 10 minutes! No, but really,  the place has good food. 

The only thing I was sad about was the lack of Blue Fine Tuna sashimi and sushi. Apparently, this is normal in Toronto? I think I'll stick to my DC sushi then. But from pasta, to lamb, to sashimi, to nigiri, to tataki, to spring rolls, it all good a yummy in my tummy rating from me. Just look at those pictures! Delicious! 

Also, the whole iPad thing was so cool. I've never seen it before, so it was awesome. I totally ordered way too much. But we ate it all anyway!"}
{"text":"I really liked my experience here except for the Italian cuisine cheese mixing with sushi-doesn't go lol. This place is good value for what you're getting. I loved the assorted sashimi, lamb chops, curries, satays, peanut beef, spicy eggplant, all the dragon rolls, seaweed salad, shrimp dumplings, and escargot. Everything was decent. Just the seaweed rolls aren't as good and they don't offer dessert as part of the ayce. The best part is the food is ordered on an ipad in a nice lounge. You might want to request two ipads for a large party as it was hard to order for the whole group."}
{"text":"Literally the worst experience I've ever had at an AYCE sushi restaurant- Even the Spoon and Fork In Vaughan THE SAME FOOD except the quality of the food here is -10 and the Vaughan location is +10.

To be honest I am still sitting trying to find things I like of off this menu as everything I've tried so far tastes bad/sour or bland- the only thing I can applaud them on is the Salmon Teriyaki, Beef tataki and the Escargots (please tell me how I can fill up on those ) 



I'm dreading paying for this - at a restaurant like this especially with the lovely atmosphere you would assume the quality quantity and taste would be top of the line - would not recommend"}
{"text":"Dinner will cost you $40 for the AYCE. They give you a tablet with pictures of all the food you can order and you select the quantities directly on the tablet. When you are ready, you select the order button and a waiter comes over and sends in the order. Besides the copious amounts of sushi that you will be ordering, you can also get italian, thai and french dishes as well. I was surprised to see escargot on the menu and ordered it to see how they would prepare it. Needless to say, i was pleasantly surprised.

The fish for the sushi is pretty fresh and they don't overload the rice like a lot of AYCE sushi places. However, for $40 per person for dinner is still very expensive. I would probably come back for lunch when it is cheaper."}
{"text":"I only tried the takeout section so I can't comment on the dine in experience - however since the takeout section overlooks the dining section I can say it did look nice.  there is also an outside small patio that you can enjoy the weather.  That's a nice plus...you are sitting next to the cars in the parking lot...but still being outdoors is nice. 

Located in a small strip plaza on York Mills/Don Mills area, this restaurant is ok.  There is a small area for takeout sushi/sashimi - looking quickly at the prices they were about $8.99 for about 8 pieces of sushi.  There is a also a small menu to order from - rice, noodles, soups, apps etc   I ordered the spicy basil chicken which comes with a small portion of white rice.  This was $10.  It was nothing special in the flavour department - the typical red/green peppers, big chunks of onions and some pieces of chicken and a few strands of basil in a fairly decent sauce.  At least it was a bit spicy so that's a plus.  I was hungry so it hit the spot but I'm not sure  I'd come back.

There is major construction around this area so currently it's a bit of a nightmare to get in and out of the plaza,"}
{"text":"Tonight my wife and I wanted to go to an  AYCE place which we've never been before.  We remember hearing good experience my friends had Spoon and Fork in Vaughan.  Now of course I know York Mills is a different location all together but didn't feel like driving to Vaughan to just to have dinner as well as we have a few things to pick up at Galleria Korean supermarket which is located on the same plaza.  So thinking Spoon and Fork food quality and selections should be the same considering it's like franchise, why not give a shot.

My wife being careful, she immediately made reservations over the phone.  She just wanted to make sure we can get a seat that night.  When she made a call, the person on the phone was nice and the booking was seamless.

By the time we got there we told of our reservations, and we were seated within minutes.

So obviously the place was darkly lit, beautiful chandeliers with classy interior design gave an automatic high end romantic feel.  The seats were well space though I don't seem to see many tables.  In fact there was a family of 6 behinds where both children and parents were seated next to each other except they put 4 in booth seating and 2 in other seating.  So I guess be prepared to be eating in different tables if you have more than 4 people.  Ordering system they use is the iPad and everytime you place an order the waiter/waitress have to clear the screen for you which was awkward.  I feel the waiter or waitress are busy enough as they are.  Why they created a system where they have to make a special trip to help the table submit the orders?

Now as for the food what was great?  Curry Chicken, Peanut Shrimp, Curry Shrimp, Green Curry Chicken, Green Curry Beef, Curry Fish, and Steak.

What food was ok?  Dim Sum and dumplings were alright except found the Red Bean Paste but doesn't look like what it showed on the iPad ordering.  Was expected a small and cute handcrafted porcupinne looking bun.  Very misleading.

What's not so great, anything else not Curry except for Steak.

For example, the Sashimi was a bit dry and had no taste.  The Sushi rolls were, flavorless.  The cashew chicken had this odd no so fresh taste.  That's just to name a few.

The Highlight of the Evening has to goes to our Server Alina provided great service with a smile.  Very tentative, clearing our empty plates very quickly, and asking us if everything was ok a number of times during our dinner.  In the end I felt thanks to her the night was completed when she offer complimentary dessert.  Dessert shots and Creme Brule.  So if Alina is reading this, thank you!  You made our Evening.  

Note:  This AYCE doesn't include dessert or drinks which is a shame considering other places for the same price of $30 per person, I feel have more extensive menu with at least dessert if not drinks.

Because of the Ambience and the Service giving 3 stars."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a variety of AYCE items. They offer dim sum, thai, Japanese, italian and American food. All of their dishes are surprisingly delicious. I've never seen an AYCE that offers escargot. The place is well decorated, and has a classy feel. The only downside to this place for me is that it doesn't offer dessert as part of the buffet lunch/ dinner menu. I thought at the very least, they should offer ice cream. Their desserts range from $6.00-$9.00 extra and only have a few selection. Their drinks (tea included) are also at additional cost. Overall, it is good place to check out if your looking for some high quality AYCE."}
{"text":"I am a regular here but today i had the worst service. Some old gentleman who looked like an owner made me and my guests wait 15min when we could clearly see the empty seats. And then kept on asking us if we have more members coming or not, i have no idea why that was important. He kept on passing our table frowning upon us and threw dishes on our table. Also sushi we got had so much rice in it we couldnt eat them without chocking. Maybe the owner changed? Its the worst visit i have ever experienced and will never return again. For a quality ayct buffet this is unacceptable. (Waiters were nice though)"}
{"text":"Spoon and Fork gets a solid \"meh\". The food was okay. Nothing was bad. But nothing was great either. This location was previously Matsu, which was a much superior restaurant. 
The appetizers were probably the best part of the meal. The calamari and tempura basket were both good. 
When it comes to sushi, my biggest pet-peeve is cold rice. Maki should taste fresh, not refrigerated. This maki was definitely cold and mediocre.
I also don't understand how an \"All You Can Taste\" place doesn't have bottomless soft drinks. Dessert is extra too. 
I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"This spoon and fork is located in North York - much different from the one in Vaughan. Upon first look, in the parking lot - there aren't many parking spots. Going in, it's very nice, the decor is nice, the staff were very friendly and I went early in the day, so it was pretty quiet.

The food was really amazing, the salmon sashimi - not as fresh as Vaughan's location but the escargot was AWESOME.

The calamari and shrimp tempura were to die for.

You're probably wondering why I gave three stars by this point. One, none of the staff were ever smiling. They got orders wrong and were all over the place. Secondly, there is no ice cream machine at this location. How is it spoon and fork PLUS without an ice cream machine?!

The dessert menu is completely separate. When asking the owner why - he said they just don't have a machine. Well, considering I'm paying the same price as the Vaughan location... that's not a very great excuse.

3.5/5"}
{"text":"Food and service was horrible.  

The owner was holding back food because he told us we only allow to order 60 pcs per order so this way the restaurant have enough food to serve for \"later\"  reservation .   

My family loves sashimi .   We noticed every time we order more sashimi , they served is smaller pieces .   

Also, my family had to pulled this waiter teeth if the meal comes with dessert .   It appears that they don't want to serve dessert."}
{"text":"Came at lunch to see what all the fuss was about and was a little let down. This place is pretty expensive. I loved that they had escargot and sashimi for lunch. The sushi and sashimi was fresh but the rest of the menu was OK. Was severely disappointed that dessert was not included in lunch or dinner buffet as most places I've been to at least have ice cream. Every round our orders were missing items and after 3 small rounds, the waiter kept our iPad and we could not order anymore. We would've inquired why but we were full anyways. Not sure if I would come back again for lunch. Maybe dinner will be better."}
{"text":"Sadly none of the Spoon and Fork / Prince locations are the same anymore. Both in quality and service. Sad because I was a weekly customer however I need to go back on the hunt for a good all you can eat which is hard to find these days."}
{"text":"People were nice, but we ordered the bun and not dumplings that didn't arrive to us at all. Everything was overall okay, the chicken teriyaki, sweet and sour pork, and the crispy chicken or beef (don't remember what it was called) were pretty good. Got full really fast and didn't get to try everything. We didn't get refills on our soft drinks or anything .."}
{"text":"Excellent food, ambiance and service. The only downside for all you can eat approach is that we have two little girls under 4 years old and while they ate very little we still had to pay $20 bucks for each. Please review this policy."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my mom's birthday with a total of 11 of us. They were the only location to give us a reservation at 6pm as requested. We did the all you can eat and they gave iPads to each table to order whatever we wanted. The portions are very small but since it's all you can eat that didn't really matter....and it cut down on wastage. The only problem is that it delayed the service a little. Also, only one person could be on the iPad at a time so that was a little annoying to control freaks like me that need to see the menu and order for myself.
The menu is somewhat different from other locations but the food is very good. We literally had almost every item on the menu!!
You have to order drinks/tea from the server and the dessert items are not on the iPad but include jello, Panna cotta and creme brûlée.....I did not like the panna cotta, the jello was a bit too firm but the creme brûlée was perfect....custardy and not too eggy.
The main server, Nathan, was awesome! Attentive, professional and very accommodating. The others were fine but young and not as awesome as Nathan.
The restaurant is quite big with lots of seating. When we arrived at 6 there was only one other party but by 7 the place was busy!
The washrooms were a good size but the stalls in the ladies room were disgusting. Toilet paper on the floor, wet puddles on the floor and wet toilet seat.
It is in a plaza so there is free parking outside."}
{"text":"From the excellent review, I went there for my sister birthday lunch for AYCE with high expectation.  The place was fairly empty, comparing to other similar AYCE for Sat lunch.  Only half filled.  Food is decent. Their ordering process to convenient.  Food arrived quickly.  I wish the give us a bigger table or serve in smaller dishes because there wasn't enough room to put the food.  We were there for escargot and sashimi.  Overall experience is fine but 3 disappointments.  No desert included in AYCE.  Not even ice cream.  The lunch is $19.99 per person (not cheap).  I expect fruit, desert and ice cream, (which is included in any $14.99 AYCE lunch at other places).  Four of us ordered 30 pieces of unagi sashimi.  Only 10 of thinly slice pieces came.  Not just once, but twice.  I suspect that the waiter modified the order before sending it to the kitchen.  So they have (unannounced) limit on the number of pieces.  We didn't brother to order it again for the 3rd time.  And the spicy tuna sushi never come.  We ordered it twice.  Nowhere to be seen.  No explanation.  Over all, too expensive for what we paid for.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Picked this place cuz it was the most crowded of all the non-fast food places in that strip. You know what they say; if it's crowded it must be good. It was clean, tidy and friendly. 

Ordered the rainbow roll, karaage, sushi salmon, and on the advice of our waitress, the Mac n cheese over the steak and portobello ravioli.

The rainbow roll was tasty and appetizing. The sushi salmon was good although it lacked wasabi between the fish and rice.

The karaage was odd and not the usual karaage. It was a chicken breast coated in what looked like tempura batter, then deep fried and sliced into bite size pieces and drizzled w/ katsu sauce and red pepper dust. The texture was soft and mushy, but tasted ok. I probably wouldn't order it again.

The Mac n cheese is more like a light Alfredo sauce w/ peas and ham mixed w/ rigatoni and baked w/ a dusting of bread crumbs. The ham appeared to be boiled ham since it was rubbery and spongy. Altogether though, it tasted fine. I might opt for the steak and mushroom ravioli if I ever come back though."}
{"text":"My first experience wasn't all that great. My second visits was MUCH better.

$10 meals, in 5 minutes that taste great. 





Previous review:
They don't seen to have it all together (yet)

There is a entrance for the 'Grab and go' which the doors are locked. 

Enter from the main door, ask for grab and go menu.... They don't have a grab and go menu. 
Ok...

We ordered Pad Thai and Cashew Chicken. The Cashew chicken does not come with a side of rice. 

For first impressions (before ordering)... Generally annoyed. But the menu looks good so I  am going to work hard to give this place a fair shake. 


My order came out quickly (to go)... Less than 5 minutes.

After eating, here are my thoughts:
1. I know pad Thai is the blandest of the bland Thai food. But they work hard to make it boring. 
2. Cashew Chicken was good. Good thing I ordered a side of rice to complete the plate. 

3. After ordering, I actually went outside to check the sign. It seems almost entirely \"grab and go\" unfriendly. 

I am planning to go back and try the pasta.... But I got a bad feeling."}
{"text":"We ordered take out Thai food on a Saturday night.  This was probably one of the worse Thai food I've ever eaten. The hot and sour soup felt like the dropped a container of sweet and sour chili sauce and added vegetable.  The pineapple vegetarian dish had no pineapple but some other thing that we have no idea about.   So beware that even when a restaurant is busy on a Saturday may not mean that the quality is good. And go spend your hard earned money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Spoon and Fork at the York Mills location is probably one of my favourite all you can eat places.

TIP:  I usually go just before the dinner starts, less people and the servers cater to you more. Better service then dinner time and you pay for the lunch  pricing with almost the same menu."}
{"text":"This will be the first 5 star given to an AYCE restaurant.
$17.99 a person for lunch
Super friendly and very fast service - never once did I have to ask to order food but instead the lovely waitress was always around asking if we wanted to order more food. There was a lot of different kinds of food to try and I liked them all. Mango salad and watermelon salad were great starters. Also like the chicken and beef skewers with peanut sauce. I couldn't believe there was AYCE sashimi for lunch + my favorite BBQ eel. By the time we reached the main course menu we were already so full.

All the dishes were small and this is the first time I would say getting small dishes is a benefit so that you can try more food. Although you can find better quality food out there, but for this price and AYCE it can't be beat."}
{"text":"Spoon and Fork is probably one of my favorite more upper class buffets. When it comes to sushi and fusion spoon and work does it right. All the items they offer are pretty standard when compared to other sushi buffets. But they include other non japanese items like thai food, pastas, rice bowls, soups, grilled items and etc. 

The interior decor is very nice. Makes the whole experience very pleasant and welcoming. A lot of places are starting to now use iPad style ordering where you can simply just punch in the quantity of how much you want for a specific item and scroll through all the food items available for you to choose. But the catch is for iPad ordering is for here is ( not sure about other places) but you can only order to a certain amount until the iPad locks you and denies more orders until your waiter comes and puts in a code to accept the orders.  I guess it's to help the kitchen not to get bombarded with unlimited orders and also if some people might just abuse it and order all this food. 

The food quality is pretty good. I would say above average from others, and lots of choice in selecting in what you want to eat. I came here for my birthday and unfortunately they dont have much of a birthday promo if it's your birthday... The only thing they offer you is a free chocolate cake and they will sing to you LOL... This place is definitely a nice place to go with a group of people. Not so much for just 2 people. The place gets pretty busy on weekends so a reservation is recommended. 

Overall, always a pleasure to come here once in awhile but for the price I would probably have to go somewhere else that's a bit cheaper. 

Pros: 

- More high end sushi/fusion buffet 
- Lots of items to choose from 
- Service is attentative and quick 
- Nice and clean inside 

Cons: 

- Expensive 
- No birthday specials besides cake and singing 
- iPad ordering ( can be a hit or miss) 
- Not much special or new items that stand out from other places 
- Standard sushi & sashimi"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.
Everything tasted pretty good, variety was average with a few items not available on most Jap AYCE menus such as escargot.. But nothing really stood out and menu has no dessert section. For $29, you would expect to have desserts!

The dishes worth mentioning are
Skewers - really flavorful and juicy
Penne - yes they have pasta dishes and this one was yum
Handrolls
Escargot
Tatakis"}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Yup, this place is worth what you're paying for. It's definitely on the high end for Asian-style AYCE places, but again it's worth what you're paying for.

Despite the fact I arrived here on the night of a winter storm, the restaurant was still busy for 8:30pm. We decided on AYCE as we were quite hungry, and a la carte just doesn't cut it once the word \"hungry\" is in the equation. In terms of items we ordered, they included but were not limited to:
- Escargots
- Thai spring roll
- Calamari
- Grilled satay chicken/beef
- Beef tataki
- Butterfish tataki
- Miso soup
- Wakame salad
- White tuna, butter fish, salmon, surf clam, and octopus sashimi
- Green curry
- Red curry
- Golden curry

My only complaint was the calamari, which had a lot of batter but barely any squid. Everything else tasted from above average to excellent, with top marks going to escargots, grilled satay, and the curry options. The miso soup tastes different from what you're used to; it's sweeter than what one would normally be used to. Still tastes very good though!

The major downfall of AYCE is that dessert isn't included. They do have dessert though, but you'll have to pay separate.

Service was excellent and we were attended to the whole way. The servers consistently filled our water without us reminding them, which was a bonus.

Definitely a will return for slightly special to special occasions due to travel distance."}
{"text":"Best AYCE Japanese-Thai-other in Toronto.
Only downside is for $30 dinner. 

Neither tea nor dessert are included in the price."}

Avoid this place

Only Asian food no desserts"}
{"text":"New favourite franchised Jap/Thai place.  Pfft, Spring Rolls?  Avoid if you have a Spoon & Fork near you !

Ordered the Red Curry for $12 after tax and (unnecessary) tips - it's supposed to be convenient for the working peeps so we ordered our food beforehand and came by 10min later to grab & go.  Saw a lot of prepackaged assortments of sushi for very decent prices too.. one of them had a variety of rolls and sashimi for only $9 :O

My red curry was mouthwatering.  Surprisingly, this was better than the curries I had at Sukho Thai and could contest even Khao San Road... perhaps I was extra hungry when I ate it, but the creaminess was just right and there was a very good portion of chicken and mango soaked in the basil-infused goodness of the curry.  

The jasmine rice went perfectly with the dish and the mildly spicy sign on the menu lied.  It was pretty spicy.  The Green Curry had one more hot pepper than the red one on the menu for scale, so order at your own risk.

I usually don't think much of franchises, but this one is a gem :)"}
{"text":"The food was okay, but they forgot our reservation on a busy day. The restaurant was too cold and they gave us a table by the entrance door. We were freezing while eating. We asked to move the table to inside but they said that the empty tables inside were fully reserved. We like Spoon and Fork in Etobicoke, but today's experience at their new location ruined our family lunch."}
{"text":"Love it. it is amazing, you got to try Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Indian.. all in one place.  Plus the food is really good. I had a Lamp stack was really great"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends on a Saturday night. I was expecting the place to be packed so I made reservations. Good thing it wasn't packed because we had an extra person joining us that night and it wasn't an issue. 

The menu is pretty extensive. There were various dishes from different cuisines. 

There was only one dish I didn't like which was the stuffed crab shell. It was extremely salty and one of my friends said it tasted like canned tuna. 

I find that their sushi was mediocre. There's something about the texture of the rice that wasn't quite right. I think they didn't use Japanese rice or added too much water to the rice. 

The dishes I did like were the escargots, salmon sashimi and beef tataki. 

For $30 without tips and tax, the price seems okay since there was so much to choose from. However, do keep in mind that dessert is not included. Also, the waitress we had (Mavis) was extremely polite so the service here was excellent. 

I would come back here for this price because there were a lot more things I haven't tried on the menu. However, it'll be a while before I visit this restaurant again so that my wallet can recover."}
{"text":"This will be the first 5 star I will give to any restaurant so far. The ambiance, the vibe, the service, and most importantly the food was more than exceptional. 

The staff and service were very welcoming and especially when I had booked a reservation just in case of any problems, everything went smoothly. My family and I went for a birthday celebration and was definitely a memorable one. 

We were all going to do the AYCE menu for dinner which comes about to $29.99 + taxes (This does not include Dessert or drinks) but it was worth every cent. If you are looking for an AYCE spot that feels like a 5 star restaurant and that has tons of different kinds of cuisines, then Spoon & Fork Plus is for you! 

Some of my favorite dishes were: All the different types of sashimi (TOP NOTCH FRESH I MIGHT ADD), the calamari, the skewers, the mango salad, california salad, the pork wing, coconut shrimp, salmon teryaki, the beef tataki, spicy flat breads, pad thai noodles, lamb chops, crispy beef, and there's more pictures that you can see that I will post!

There are 6 desserts on the menu and literally you cannot go wrong with any of these choices. 

The point is that you will not be disappointed, and this would a great place I would recommend to ANYONE who wants to have a great dining experience in Toronto."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch AYCE with my buddies. Great place, nice decor, menu, ordering system, and food.

Ordering System - all done via tablet. Easy to use system, and food was quick to get. 

Menu - wide variety of items ranging from scallop's, traditional sushi, grilled meats, and even pasta. 

Food - for the price and options available, the food was great. Some items that didn't seem to fit in with the restaurant didn't taste as good but wasn't a big issue.  

Service - great friendly service. Didn't care how much we ordered. As mentioned it was quick for our food to arrive. 

Overall great place. Would recommend, please note there is a time limit when it comes to ordering 2hrs. Would recommend for family, date, business, or those days you just want to eat"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

The quality of the food was good, portions are a good size- they're a little smaller so you can taste more items on the menu.

Unfortunately, dessert is not included in the $18.99 price tag. No green tea ice cream fix today.

Also, tea will cost you $3.00.

Quality was good, value not so much."}
{"text":"I'm quite conflicted about how I feel about Spoon and Fork Plus. I've been here twice both times on a Saturday for lunch within the span of less than a month.

The first time we went was my birthday barely making it for lunch entering the restaurant at 2:55 pm. Following that first visit to this AYCE restaurant I was prepared to give them four stars. The service was great, and extremely timely given their iPad ordering system. The food was served  hot and at a good pace, in the order of the menu. Of course there was also the sushi and the sashimi, the freshest fish I've ever had an AYCE style restaurant. Their Thai mains were amazing as well, both of my friends and I were extremely satisfied with both the peanut chicken and the red beef curry. The only dishes we order that were not up to par were the shrimp sumei and the butter chicken (which tasted more like a chicken masala). The selection of rolls is also quite limited but given the extensive number of dishes available over all this should really be an issue unless you're specifically going to order rolls. Overall a really fantastic first impression of the place.

On the other hand my second visit two weeks later, we arrived earlier around 1:40 pm. The service this time wasn't anywhere as great as the last. Immediately after ordering, we were bombarded with dish after dish, starting with mains moving to selective appetizers then dim sum, more appetizers and finally ending with sushi. The pace of dish service kept our table full forced us to scarf down the food which wasn't as hot or fresh as the last time around. We finished everything fairly quickly at the rushed pecs but felt extremely full due to the rate of consumption we were forced into just to fit the arriving dishes I the table. Pace of service seems to slow down around 2:30 pm for lunch so I would recommend coming in for a late lunch to get the most satisfying experience."}
{"text":"For our first meal back in my fiance's hometown and in belated celebration of his birthday, we decided to try out Spoon and Fork. The last time we were in the city, it was still known as Matsu (all u can eat Thai? + Japanese). The food was fairly decent but nothing too memorable. With the additional choices of Italian dishes, we were excited to see how S&F compares to its precedent. 

We arrived for our 7:30 PM Friday night 6 ppl reservation and we were seated immediately. The place was not too overly crowded (perhaps half filled?). We quickly placed our first round of order (mainly appetizers and a bit of sashimi). The food came out soon after. Each dish was enough to be eaten individually or to be shared. Everything we tasted was pretty spot on - better than stand alone Japanese, Thai, or Italian restaurant in the area. The sashimi was extremely fresh. Amazed by the first round of orders, we hurried and submitted our orders for main dishes + pastas.  

Again the food came out soon after and they were piping hot. Some of the highlights included fried agnolotti (tasted just like fried mozzarella) with the AMAZING rose sauce, white tuna pizza (the pizza part was fried sushi rice with chipotle mayo), beef and mushroom ravioli (each order only came in 2 - but each was so meaty and loved the mushroom masala sauce they swam in), lamb chops (a lil over cooked for lamb but they were sooooo well seasoned - even with a bit overcooked - still so juicy and tender). Everything else we ordered - seafood casserole, salmon gnocchi, veal parm, penne pesto, Thai basil tilapia, escargot, scallop Rockefeller, tempura basket, fried calamari, butterfish tataki, fried beef - were all delicious too. Would definitely return to try more of the Thai dishes, sushi rolls, and perhaps the flatbread (Tandori chicken + goat cheese? yes please!).   

Amazing deal for a place with such high quality + tasty food all you can eat- especially with such interesting cuisine combo! There was a bit confusion with our orders of the sashimi and sushi however. For our table of 6, we wanted 5 orders of 5 pieces of sashimi - but our waitress thought we just wanted 5 pieces (this actually happened a couple of time) but no problem since the food came out in such a nice pace and our table was constantly being replenished with more yums! Another downside to this restaurant is that soft drinks don't come with free refill - fountain 16oz - $2 each.  Additionally, desserts are not part of the all you can eat. 

We still ordered 3 desserts at the end of our meal - no birthday celebration is complete without ending on something sweet! 2 green tea creme brulee and 1 chocolate explosion (chocolate molten cake with caramel sauce). Since my new diet consists of high protein and low/no sweets - i only had a bite of the green tea creme brulee - but definitely wished I had more. It was much better than the one I had at Gyu-kaku. Strong green tea flavor and not overly sweet! 

What's even better is that - on our way out of the restaurant - all the items on the to go section was half off (part of at the end of the day/closing sale?) - one can score green tea creme brulee to go for only $1.50 each! And assorted sashimi or sushi for $5! Too bad we were all too stuffed to take advantage of the ridiculous deal. Hope this location of S&F is here to stay for my fiance and I to return for our future visits!"}
{"text":"Everything was pretty good, except.....the pastas were pretty terrible. We got 3 of them and all 3 of them disgusting. I should've known better. 

The appetizers were probably the best part of the meal"}
{"text":"So, when I found out that Spoon & Fork was an AYCE place, I really didn't have high expectations...but when I then found out it was a Japanese/Thai/Italian AYCE place, my expectations lowered even more. The only thing that really gave me any hope we're the Yelp reviews. I went for dinner tonight. We had the AYCE which was 28.99. Drinks and dessert are extra. Soda does not have free refills--- it's $2 a glass. The restaurant is beautiful inside and all of the servers were very pleasant and friendly. AYCE is ordered via iPad and you can order as often as you wish. The food quality and flavour was really good. I was pleasantly surprised. I've been to other Japanese AYCE places that were simply underwhelming.  But at Spoon and Fork we liked almost everything we tried. 

After reading Yelp reviews, I tried the escargot. It was good. It's not one of those things you expect to see in an AYCE place so try it if you get the chance. Standout dishes were the Seafood casserole, coconut shrimp, chicken and veg chow main, and all the sushi, maki, sashimi we ordered. We would've liked to try more but we just couldn't eat anymore!

There seems to be more options on the iPad menu than are shown on the menu posted on their website, like dimsum and Chinese dishes. 

I didn't try any of the Italian dishes. It just didn't go with the Asian flavours I was enjoying. It's a great alternative though for folks who don't want to eat Asian food. 

We did take advice of other yelpers and ordered the watermelon salad less the tomatoes and cheese---i.o.w. \"Just watermelon\"---to cleanse our pallet after the meal. That was a great tip!  

Would I come back to Spoon & Fork?  Yes! Definitely!  There aren't a lot of good AYCE Japanese places out there anymore, especially in the burbs, so I was happy to have found this place. Next time, I'll have to try their $14.99 Lunch AYCE menu."}
{"text":"My friend made reservations and had told them there were babies (need a regular chair to add booster & there was a newborn), yet they still sat us in the area with the booths. When we asked to switch over to the other side with more space they said it was reserved for those with reservations. So our reservation doesn't matter?

We went for AYCE. I liked ordering on the Ipad. However, it doesn't matter what you order as they only bring you less than the bare minimal plus the portions were tiny. We ordered many rolls, sashimi, wings, etc. on the ipad, and I'd say 50% of the items ordered did not arrive and we had to place the order again. How annoying is that? 

Price was steep. I don't think I'm coming back here again."}
{"text":"Second time going there in 4-5 years. Don't really think of this place when I want sushi. Atmosphere was nice. Food was okay; didn't get the \"omg this is delicious\" feeling. nigiri was better than rolls (Rolls had too much rice in them) Also all you can eat menu doesn't have the other types of food to try (only on a la carte menu)...a bit disappointed about that. Dessert is not included in all you can eat either...booooo! Not worth the price. Don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"Had a great option to have all you can eat for 29,99$ and it was just great! At the same time they sell premade sushi sets for half a price after 17:00"}
{"text":"Tried their Steak and portobello Ravioli... Absolute delish!!! U have got to try that. And their pina colada too."}
{"text":"I've had a good couple of experiences with Spoon and Fork. First experience was when we ordered in a plethora of different dishes to the office for lunch. Spoon and Fork seemed to be the best option for our group, offering a wide range of dishes from everywhere...Green curry! Mango Fried Rice! Caesar Salad! A strange but awesome mixture of whatever you're looking for can be found here. 
Second experience - was looking for a 'winter warmer' (ie. soup!) and came here for some wonton soup - very nice, although I was tempted by their $12 lunch menu where you can pick a full meal out of 15 or so options and it's $12. I'll definitely have to come back and take advantage of that, and on a hungrier day...their AYCE tasting menu! It's also very reasonably priced ($19 is the price when I went at lunch). 
Very nice inside and larger than expected. The plaza it's in is kinda terrible though, and parking is scarce especially at lunch. If you go around the side, there is garage parking. Kinda tucked away, but it helps on those days where spots out front are just non-existent!"}
{"text":"Love this place but its kind of expensive.   Their agnalotti are ridiculously amazing. 
I could eat 50 of them easily. 

Their sushi is very very good too.   Just wish it didnt cost so much"}
{"text":"My new favourite AYCE restaurant. It has so many options!

The decor is very nice, the washrooms are super clean, the service was fantastic (handled our group of 15ish with ease), the food was super good quality and best part about the food was you can eat as much as you want!

I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Finally tried out this place and it was incredible. All you can eat lunch for $17, sushi is so fresh, food is so good. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I sometimes come here for salmon or sushi and like the atmosphere. However, tonight they had the darkest lighting I have eaten in. It was reminiscent of the ice storm .  When candles and minimal lighting was only available.
We had the beef with broccoli and spicy eggplant with the California salads. They were tasty, but 75%  of the pleasure eating food is seeing it. Which was not possible in low light. You also need to order a rice or some other extra as it's not included.
It would have been just fine all around , but the lack of lighting really took away from the dinner.
If the lighting was that low next time we wanted a similar dinner , we certainly would not come in."}
{"text":"Didn't try their buffet but did find a great sushi deal for all you yelpers! Their pre-made sushi sets in the fridge are 50% off after 5pm. Not sure if that's a daily deal but it applied yesterday (Monday) when I was there. 

Sushi was not bad! Great variety and quality for the value. Pretty good portion sizes too. My boyfriend got one set that had an 8-piece rainbow roll + 4 piece sashimi + 3 pieces of sushi. I got a set with 6 pieces of assorted sushi and 8-piece salmon and avocado roll. These sets cost between $10-$15 before the discount. 

Restaurant looked nice and their buffet menu looked interesting too. Might go back for the ayce now :)"}
{"text":"My goodness this place is overly priced! They give you ipads to choose and order your food and guess what? We were a big crowd and all our orders got mixed up. They ended up bringing the wrong items and some of the orders were brought to our table twice, despite ordering once. The dessert is not part of the deal and you have to pay separately, which sucks!
The only thing I liked about this place was that it looked a little more fancy that your average AYCE restaurant. Each of us ended up paying around $50 that night."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times for AYCE dinner. Dinner is approximately $40 per person. The dinner menu has a lot of variety, but I do find that my family and I kept ordering the same items over and over again. The watermelon salad, caprese salad, beef tataki, cantaloupe and prosciutto salad were my favourites. I believe my sister and I each ordered 2-3 caprese salads and 2-3 watermelon salads. The fruits and vegetables were all really fresh, didn't have any problems with wilted greens. Everything else was pretty good, like the satay, Thai green curry, Thai sweet and sour fish, Pad Thai, etc. I can't exactly remember everything we order, but the only suggestion is stay away from the pastas. The gnocchi was gloopy, and the alfredo was mediocre. 
$40 is a tad  pricey compared to most AYCE places, but considering that the menu has so much to offer and the quality of the food is quite good, I believe its worth the $40."}
{"text":"If there was an option of 0 stars I would've rated that. We received the worst service ever the minute we walked in. The male greeter was really rude when we did nothing wrong to upset him.
At first, I thought he was just stressed and exhausted at how busy it was so I didn't get so bothered at first with how rude he was but after reading previous recent reviews, it seems like lot's of other people also complained about him. 
After a long wait of about 30 minutes, we asked him how long it was going to be still. He started to get frustrated with us when all we did was ask a simple question. Kept saying \"give me a minute!\" in a rude tone. I noticed he got frustrated with other customers as well. He should be fired.
We didn't have a reservation that day but the people who did have reservations ALSO had to wait as long as us. Must be that their service is really slow. 
I was really looking forward to try their food so I'll maybe come back to try it but it seems their food isn't even that good after reading other people's reviews of this place.
This place seems like a place I'd go once and never come back, the environment and people working here is not something you'll want to come back to. Sorry."}
{"text":"I have been craving Thai food this week, so after trying another restaurant yesterday, I thought I will try this location of fork and spoon as I always visit another location in the north side of the city
I always get that all you can eat option, but this time at this location they had something new which is the lunch special, a Compaq menu with a few selections.
So I did go with this option, it's seem to like add good deal for $14 you get a soup salad's and main dish with steam dries along with some salmon roll or vegetables tempura.
The deal is unbeatable, but the food was not that good, it's lacked flavour big time, and it was just too blah
Service was very quick and the food arrived within five minutes maybe, so it is great for a quick lunch bite, if only the food in here tasted better! Too bad"}
{"text":"Minus one star because the soup never arrived. However, almost everything that DID hit the table was really good! I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and high-quality the sashimi was, and the butterfish was terrific as well. The unagi felt a little old and a bit dry but the basil beef, cashew chicken, dumplings, and other items were really tasty. Good service and a nice atmosphere. There was a loud drunk table and some shrieking kids but overall it was a good experience. My fave AYCE place in Toronto right now."}
{"text":"3.5/5 Food was ok. I wouldn't recommend this place for big groups, mainly because there's only one ipad per table for making orders. Food comes in pretty quickly and service was alright from my experience."}
{"text":"im surprised i didnt go to this place sooner.  

im very impressed... ambience and decor is very modern and nice.. makes you feel like your eating at a very high class expensive place.  

the food was very good for AYCE.  very impressed.  some unique items that you wont see at the other ayce places.  

here are some pros and cons if your deciding whether to come..

pros
1. ambience and setting
2. unique menu (sushi, italian, thai, fillet mignon, lamb chop, crispy beef sweet beef)
3. not as loud (keep in mind i went on a weekday) (also theres more caucasians than asians.. which plays affect in the level of noise whether you want to admit it or not.)
4. service will be more attentive (servers will know how to speak english at the very least)

cons
1. price - on the expensive side
2. no desserts  ( dont really understand why they dont add an item or two for dessert.. it could be such a selling point for them and cost them nothing compared to some of their food items they serve)

overall, i give them a solid 4 and will likely return based on my past experience..."}
{"text":"A friend of mine went to this restaurant with her special needs sister (whom is wheel chair bound) , May 2016. She only eats specific foods when dining out. My friends was told that her sister was not allowed to eat the food that she brought, as it was considered to be \"outside food\". She sarcastically asked if she should feed her sister outside... Where the staff replied YES.  Humiliated, My friend took  her sister out of the restaurant, and fed her pretty much on the street. I am absolutely DISGUSTED by the actions of this establishment, will never dine here and will recommend everyone I know to boycott this restaurant."}
{"text":"So glad I came here for my birthday dinner this past Sunday! I went to their Vaughan location a few years ago and loved it, so when my grandma suggested going to a buffet/AYCE, I immediately thought of Spoon and Fork. The place was a lot emptier than I expected (around 1/3 full) which made me a little wary. Other than the high prices ($29.99 for weekend dinner, $19.99 for weekend lunch), I can't think of any reason why there weren't more people here! Overall, I'd give Spoon and Fork Plus a 9/10. 

PROS:
+ food - They serve a variety of Japanese, Thai and Italian dishes, and everything we tried was really good! We particularly enjoyed the sushi and sashimi (which were quite fresh!), tempura, beef satay, lamb chop, beef tataki, salmon tataki and the green and red curries (my grandma is Thai and gave her approval!). They also have some dimsum dishes, fried rice and pasta that we didn't try.
+ serving size - Portions are quite small, so it's nice that you can sample lots of dishes and just order more of whatever you like. A very good thing for people like me whose eyes are wayyy bigger than their stomachs, but feel bad wasting all the food they took from the buffet line but ended up not liking!
+ service - Our server was so sweet! She offered to get us hot lemon water because she could tell that we didn't want to spend $3 each on tea lol, and after our meal she asked if wanted a plate of watermelon for dessert. Always quick to clear our plates and refill our water, and even though you could tell she was really busy, she was always smiling and friendly. The food came out quickly but not all at once...I guess that could be a con depending on what you prefer.
+ ambiance - This place is classy and hip. Look at the photos!
+ iPad ordering system - Really efficient and easy. There are also photos for every dish which is helpful! 

CONS:
- no drinks or desserts - For $30+ a person, you'd expect dessert to be included...even if it's something simple like ice cream or fruit. But no. Sad face. 

It's not the best food I've ever had and it's pricey, but I will definitely be back...probably for a weekday lunch when it's cheaper!"}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of the Spoon and Fork franchise locations and this is one of the better ones.  This location has dim sum along with a variety of Thai/Vietnamese meat skewers.  They also have a lot of options for fried rice and noodles compared to other locations.  The service was great and the food came fast and mostly a lot at the same time.  The only reason why I didn't give it a 5 stars was because it is not free drink refills like the other locations and desserts are extra charge."}
{"text":"Oyshi...Yammy ....You got to accurate the map...it all mixed up yelp..
Anyway, the best Japanese buffet all you can eat....place ..You can eat sashimi and sushi with good price... love these place for the family dinners."}
{"text":"I came here for my mom's birthday lunch celebration. It was $17.99 per person for \"all you can taste.\" Honestly, it wasn't as hyped out as people said it would be... The TASTE, was no different than other Japanese/Thai/Italian restaurants.
The decor was amazing, however, the Japanese and Thai portion isn't much different than what other ayce restaurants offer. The Italian part wasn't that bad, but again, there was nothing special about it (yes, I did try the escargot). 
Also, I believe that some of the sashimi was not as \"fresh\" as it should've been as my sensitive stomach reacted to it. 
Like what other reviews say, desserts and drinks not included. Needless to say, this place is overpriced for what it offers. 
Service, well, compared to other ayce places, this place probably has nicer and faster service, however, this might be because I came here on a weekday for lunch (they only had 6 tables). 
Overall, the food was not that special, and for the price and what it's worth... I may not be visiting anytime soon."}
{"text":"The environment, taste, display and service are all good. It's my favorite buffet location."}
{"text":"AYCE about $40 plus tax & TIPS per person, doesn't include dessert or drinks.  The sushi & hand rolls was full of RICE & bits of tempura batter.  The first basket of shrimp tempura the shrimp was cold.  Sashimi was not put on any ice, so 10 minutes later from just eating the raw-fish we all got sick....should have known better when we noticed that all 3 chefs standing behind the raw-fish station just looking around with nothing to better to do.  The watermelon salad and mango salad were great.  \"Tasting menu\", exact words from the head waiter, portions were huge pad-Thai, veggies, curry, pasta...anything cooked 1 plate could feed 3 adults. Plus the service from the waitresses were really bad, they just came by the table and dropped the plate of food down like they were doing us a favour.  THIS WAS THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.  4 adults no drinks, no dessert, was tax and tips $160.00.

GO DOWN THE STREET TO MATSUDA.
AYCE for $36 plus tax you can a dinner and a show, and for $28 plus tax you get dinner & dessert, plus their tasting menu sizes are big enough that you can try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"This place was comfortable and had lots of seating. Their menu actually has a good variety of items such as sushi, dim sum, fried rice and pad thais etc. I found their dim sum surprisingly quite tasty, the sushi rice was a ya harder and they skimped out on the unagi but the sashimi was tasty. 
Only thing was, it was quite busy when we went so the waiters and waitresses were not as attentive to giving us stuff like wasabi and tea. There were lots of Christmas parties on the Friday that we went though. 
The lunch was around $17.99 Which was not bad for the price at lunch. We were able to bring my toddler and baby along as well and my toddler was free."}
{"text":"Do not go there! The food/fish were not fresh. All of us had really bad diarrhea after the meal."}
