{"text":"Great food and great takeout. They have recently remodeled and added sushi which is a great change for this area. (Haven't tried it yet). Fast service."}
{"text":"If i could give negative stars i would. This is hands down the worst treatment i have received from a Chinese restaurant. They got my order completely wrong probably because they barely speak English. I ordered springs rolls and got sushi rolls. I can't eat sushi so I would never order it. When i told them i didnt order sushi as i dont eat it, they refused to believe me and insisted I ordered it simply because my number was on the order. After several minutes of back and forth, I realized they were refusing to refund my order, since I paid for it before I received it. I will take this up with my credit card company. I would suggest saving yourself the drama and avoid this place.

It only got worse when I got home. The meat in my meal and my wife's was completely inedible. I am use to poor quality Chinese but there was something terribly wrong with the meat here, the best way to describe it is to say it doesn't taste real, it's a very fake tasting meat.

The interior looks nice and is very deceptive as it does not reflect the quality of food they serve here. I thought all Chinese restaurants were pretty much the same anywhere you go, but this is hands down the worst one I have been to. This was my first visit and certainly my last. I should have paid more attention to the other negative reviews, and realized there was an issue when I was the only one in their restaurant during prime dinner hours on a Saturday.

You've been warned."}
{"text":"I really had no expectations that a place with  zero reviews hidden in a drab shopping center would be good... But I was delightfully surprised. The sushi tasted fresh and was prepared to order. The staff was kind and accommodating for us and made small talk with my son which is huge with me. The decor was nice and clean. I want to say this place is family run but not sure, however, they take pride in what they do. We only had the sushi but we ordered a few to split we had the avocado, spicy tuna, and dragon roll... The dragon roll was fucking amazing. Gone before I could get a picture of it!! Worth trying at least for sushi!! Four year old approved!!"}
{"text":"Saturday, noon, no one here, and still took me 30+ minutes to receive my online order.  This is the closest Chinese place to me, and the food isn't that great, especially for that kind of wait."}
{"text":"Didn't like their sesame chicken at all. And their rice is gross. There is definitely better Chinese food around here than this place"}
