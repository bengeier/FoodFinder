{"text":"A hidden gem in Scarborough. Like this place was was abit dirty, but the food was amazing. Hot notch noodles and side dishes and its pretty authentic Szechuan restaurant."}
{"text":"Craving for spicy food so drove to give this place a try. We got a table right away maybe because it was a weeknight. Since it was Sichuan cuisine we thought it would be really spicy and we were actually up for the challenge. However the food wasn't as spicy as we thought.   We order three dishes but all turned out alright only.  1. Pork chop fries. The batter was too thick and there were more fat than meat.  2. Noodles. The noodle was ok.  3. Fish in chilli oil soup. Expected this to be really good but was disappointed. The fish pieces had no flavour and there weren't alot of pieces for the price I'm paying  I thought the price of the food was higher than average."}
{"text":"If you like spicy food, this place is for you.  I tried the kung pao chicken, mapo tofu, hot boiling fish and their house fried rice. All of them are good, tasty and spicy.    My only concern is they do not take credit or debit card... Cash only.  The servers cannot speak proper English and not all dishes have proper description or pictures.  The place is not exactly the cleanest and tables are covered with plastic just cause chili oil could create a mess.  Overall, I had a pleasant meal and the food is good.  I'd definitely come back or recommend this place.  I would give this place a 4 to 5 star if they could change their menu to something more presentable like adding pictures, spiciness level and more English description."}
{"text":"I just went yesterday.  Service was very prompt. Food came very quickly.  I ordered 4 dishes for 2 people. Too much food  Spicy and sour vermicelli: i order it whenever i see it on the menu at any chinese restaurant. This one is the most authentic by far. Big portion.  Kung pao chicken: very tender. Great flavor. Big portion  Hot spicy spicy mini hotpot: best one i've had in toronto. Huge portion. Very hearty. Lots of everything.  Beef rice noodles: very tasty. Huge portion. Lots of beef.  Total was only $44 after taxes. It came to just a bit over $50 with tips. Debit card accepted. I wouldn't say they have the best food, but they are very generous in the portion size and condiments. (I couldn't loathe more, fish legend in first markham place) For the price, hot spicy spicy can't be beat. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"THE GOOD: Authentic northern chinese cuisine, in the style of northern china e.g. sichuan.  Food was superb.  Ordered the cold noodle appetizer (shown in pictures here), beef noodle soup (lunch special), fried rice (lunch special), mushroom and cucumber cold appetizer (to balance out the heat from the the cold noodle appetizer).  Came out to approx. $40 incl tax - how great is that?!.  They actually have two levels of spice according to whether or not they think you can handle it.  I went with my asian friend who spoke mandarin and the food was ultra spicy and tongue numbing.  Later, I went with colleagues (we look like a Benetton campaign) and it was toned down alot.  Still excellent though.  Owners are very hospitable, especially the Mrs.    THE SO-SO: Language.  Owners and servers mainly speak mandarin.  If you're expecting detailed breakdown of what's in the food, forget it.  Your best bet is to go with someone who speaks mandarin and can read chinese.  Otherwise, it's a bit of a gamble.  I'm not very adventurous so I stick with what I know and bring my friend when I want to try something new.  Wait staff are nice but don't understand much English.  I guess they're outside of their comfort zone so they run away quickly rather than dissect what you're asking.  THE BAD: Decor.  This is in the style of typical fast food restaurants in China.  If it's good enough for all of China, why shouldn't it be good enough for Canada?  They keep the cost down by focusing on fresh food rather than decor and models in mini-skirts (yes I'm talking about Joey''s restaurants).  NOTE:  Restaurant is located in Finch/Leslie plaza on the north side of plaza."}
{"text":"First of all, Sichuan is not in the northern.... it's in the southern part of China. So lol for people said it's in the northern part.  Short Version: This place is pretty authentic Chongqing food. Chongqing used to belong to Sichuan province, but this no longer is the case, they are now directly reporting to Beijing. So yeah, it's similar sichuan style with it's unique signature. Sichuan is a big province and food have small difference from city to city in Sichuan.  Recommend dishes: Fish/Beef in spicy pungent sauce, mo yu duck,fu qi fei pian, spicy chicken, A choy with Garlic.   The sichuan style sausage is not authentic, it's not good, don't order it.  For people who don't like it..please judge after you know what to order first.   PS. I consider myself a pretty native Sichuanese, reason is my parent were both born and raised in sichuan so are my granparents, I was born and raised in sichuan till I was 5 and I used to go back to sichuan every 1 or 2 years till I turned 18 and got sent to Canada."}
{"text":"Having spent part of my life living in Sichuan, this place offers very authentic Sichuan food. Sichuan food is widely recognized as the spicy cuisine in China, and if you are serious about getting authentic, spicy (as the name of the restaurant indicates) Chinese food, this is the place to be in Toronto to try out for at least once. They are generous with how much spice and ingredients to add, and stayed true to the Sichuan dish identity.  What I also like about this place is how current the menu is - they offer many dishes and noodles on the menu that is currently popular in Sichuan, and you won't find it anywhere else in Toronto.   I gave it a 4 instead of 5 because, for the price point they charge, I would expect better service and/or better dining environment.  To be clear, I am perfectly okay with basic service decor at Chinese restaurants, if I know it's excellent food and well priced.  The food here is excellent, but above-average price, and therefore, I think they ought to step up their service/decor game."}
{"text":"I had really bad experience in this restaurant. The waitress' attitude is extremely bad, and I ordered two dishes from menu. They just don't have them, and they won't recommend other dishes to you. Their attitudes are extremely bad bad bad!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have never been so disgusted!!  Ordered Kung Pow Chicken & Spicy Shrimp...  Kung Pow Chicken tasted nothing close to chicken! Spicy shrimp wasn't even pealed!  Not to mention the lady at the front cash desk was cutting her Nails and the whole dining room can hear her clip them!   Disgusting!!!  We just paid the bill & left!!  Never again..."}
{"text":"Called to make reservations, the lady didn't speak English and hung up on me.  Called back because friends of ours said its a great restaurant, she hung up again after only speaking Mandarin..  Terrible service before going to the restaurant impressed me so much I decided not to go. Why do we put up with such horrible customer service?"}
{"text":"Please allow me to explain why Hot Spicy Spicy has not been the crowd-pleaser, it's a spicy hot restaurant aimed towards people from the North, I'm from the North. The palate of people from the North can be compared to a sophisticated engineered blunt stick of wood.  Sometime, we demand heavy aromas to a ridiculous degree, it kind of reflects our lifestyle of wanting most things in life over-the-top. If you get into a fight with us, and deliver a weak punch, we will become very offended by the weakness of the strike, and generously offer you in return the satisfactory force of punches.   Hot Spicy Spicy caters to people who demand the same level of numbing hotness in their food which regularly cooked with flavor.  The decor is themed around 'nothing', which is a new contemporary going around like wildfire throughout restaurants in China located in any given hole in whatever wall which exists locally, the plastic sheet tablecloth adds an air of authenticity, in fact, I was impressed by this place even having lights which work, I appreciate that special...je ne c'est quoi, they really didn't need to go this far, as I am used to much less.   I was looking for the blackboard where the food should have been listed, but low&behold...MENUS!   This was the Buckingham Palace of North Cuisine! I think they might even have a washroom...but I'm not gonna push it.  Everything here come with half of this season's harvest of chilli peppers, so that our dull Northern taste buds know when to start chewing. The service is quick, as I expect from any Northern Restaurant which already have some of the food prepared beforehand, often prior to knowing of our coming.  The place is really really pricy, one would often find themselves paying over $6 per dish, so if you wanna splurge, get the fish. Bring cash, because those modern amenities is really just a waste of electricity.   I very impressed by the Northern Restaurant, food in a enclosed area, lights, tables and chairs...even a door!"}
{"text":"Husband is from the Sichuan region so we like to come for some of the flavours of that region.  Been coming for a while but have noticed some changes.  Most notably, the prices are increasing rapidly yet portions and quality are the same.  Like the spicy popcorn chicken covered with dried chilli peppers is mainly little bits and pieces of meat, no actual good pieces of meat.  Or the sweet potato and pork is very bony, again few good pieces of meat.  The beef covered in hot oil and spices in a bowl used to be better but something has changed about it.  Still tasty but was better before.  Flavours are good but pricing and quality are lowering the rating for me. N"}
{"text":"Hot spicy spicy is what you name your restaurant the same reason why Chinese teens choose their names as apple or rainbow. It just sounds cool.   I'm proud to say I'm a frequent customer of this Sichuan resto, and although they have only raised their beef noodle soup (family portion sized) by a dollar after a good year or so, I can put my Charles-inflation approved stamp on this establishment.   Beef noodle soup: $10 Tender beef, melting in your mouth. A delicious broth (no msg??) that doesn't leave you thirsty after downing a few too many gulps.   Hot red oil dumplings: $9 this is why Trevor James lives in chengdu. Come have some dumplings immersed in a hot red oil, and take the oil after and reuse up to 100 times by making your own no frills frozen dumplings. (Not bashing just I love this place)  Numbing pepper meat dishes: $10-15 with either fish or beef - get some white rice on the side and have your face numb after a few bites.   I love hot spicy spicy. I come back for a fix monthly. Nice friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"This place sure lives up to its name! And it's not just any kind of spice, it's that tongue numbing spice originating from Szechuan. The service at this place is great and the food comes SO QUICKLY. A lot of the dishes here are really cheap too, I ordered two noodle dishes for $6.99 each. If what you're looking for is some authentic Szechuan cuisine, this the place to be."}
{"text":"This is my second time to this resturant. I tasted very authentic sichuan food except that their stir fry and noodles are a bit sweet compare to what I expected. Servers are nice and helpful."}
{"text":"very dirty. One of the waiters dropped a cup and didn't bother washing it. Food was so so."}
{"text":"The noodles weren't as al dente as I had hoped, but they didn't exactly disappointed. Flavour was hit and miss, but if spicy is your inclination, then you've come to the right place.   The pickled noodles with shredded pork was my favourite. The Shanghai fired noodles was too soggy and drenched with too much oil, and the pan fried onion cake was just so wrong. It was maligned by the deep fryer.   Overall, it's worth returning. Make sure you arrive early and with cash (no credit or debit)."}
{"text":"First time here. The food is pretty good for a spicy restaurant. The service was very good except an older lady that was there. She looks like the owner. She speaks very mean and it's not good if you're not a topical northern people. I might come back but not a big fan still."}
{"text":"It was my idea to visit Hot Spicy Spicy because I remember from previous visits to this plaza that from the outside, they advertise Beef Noodle and that is a natural attraction for me.  2.5 *Star*  Inside has similar ambiance as other North Chinese Dumpling restaurants.  I like how they have dish names stuck on the wall rather than using Menu boards.  Kind of becomes a part of the decor.  Lunch Special (House Special Braised Beef Noodle in Pot($5.99) came in a ceramic pot normally standard for Rice and other dishes so as done for Noodle it might have consumed some of the heat away from the slightly salty soup and the store bought Noodles.  The BEEF was very tender in my opinion and the Cilantro/Scallions gave a bit of fresh flavour to the saltiness.  I guess Hit&Miss deal for this House Special item.  I tried the Szechuan Spicy Cold Konjac($4.99) and Chili Oil Dumpling($5.99) dish.  Neither of these are a part of my regularly food staple therefore I give them an A-OK for now but for more details please refer to the next review.  I noticed the Lunch Rice Specials($6.99) offered a large dish and a mountain of Steamed Rice.  The lady took my Teapot as I showed her an empty pot.  Yup, I never ever saw the Teapot again.  Hope it went to a better place, while I was tasting the heat from the spicy food."}
{"text":"The best sichuan restaurant in Toronto easily and at very good prices.  I come here all the time: the staff are friendly and there's quite a bit of variety in the menu.  I should mention that even for people who love, no, need spicy food regularly, the Chunking dry-fried chicken is pretty, pretty spicy.  The fish and flower tofu in chile oil is another personal favourite and their dandan noodles and yi bing oiled noodles are the best in the city."}
{"text":"Im giving this place 5 star for my love of fish in chili oil soupy dish. They always do my fave dish excellent. Everything else is good too, but my one fave is enough for me to rate them 5. Service and interior has improved very much over the past 5 years (renovated i dont know when, i was away from toronto for few years)"}
{"text":"The food is really good and as spicy as it should be in Sichuan. Ordered the spicy pork liver which was tender, delicious and without any smell of organs. Tried fried pepper-salt meat which was almost ordered by each table and it was good too.  Saw a guest ordered a dish in the hidden menu, called beef in sour soup. Will try next time, coz it smelled fantastic!  Although the food tasted good, the price is a little bit higher than average, considering the restaurant's service and environment. However, the taste has captured my stomach already, so will definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Horrible decision to come here. It's the next day and my stomach is still feeling queasy. Granted, the service and the food served was very fast. But the food was not fresh and it didn't even taste good. Definitely not going back and do not recommend this place.   As a heads up, cash or debit only."}
{"text":"This restaurant is quickly becoming one of my favorites. So far every time my bf and I come here we've tried to order something new and have yet to be disappointed. The food is amazing, so much flavour and the staff are great too! Can't wait to go back with a big group so we can try more from the menu."}
{"text":"The food is great but the owner has the worst attitude for someone in the service industry. She saw a waiter accidentally spill sauce on my clothes and just rolled her eyes. She was so unfriendly to us when we went but was so nice to older Chinese  customers. My fiancé and I are both Chinese but his Chinese is very elementary so always spoke English. Didn't know that was a pre-requisite for people in the service industry to be nice to customers."}
{"text":"My opinion is this is one of the best restaurant in the city. It's Authentic Szechuan and EVERY dish I've ever ordered  is delicious.....  I love the Duck with Konjac and the cold beef and tripe with five spice.   But, even non-spicy dishes are  SO flavorful. Anytime I have a freind from out of town who wants good Toronto food .... I take them here."}
{"text":"ASIAN LEGEND IS IN THE SAME PLAZA. Jus' sayin'....FOR A REASON.  So, I came here with my dad for dinner and we ordered:   Spicy beef noodle soup  - Big enough for 2 to share,  - generous amount of beef, but was not very tender - soup base was not spicy and needs to be more concentrated - noodles tasted plain, but pretty chewy  Spicy lettuce  - crunchy and juicy - absolutely drowned in chili oil (which made it more spicy than the noodle soup) - presentation was very unappealing  Sweet and sour chicken  -this plate screamed MSG with its neon orange colour - suprisingly there was a lot of chicken meat instead of flour  Overall: Like I said... Asian legend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place out. We both love authentic Sichuan cuisine, one of the eight cuisines in China.   The place was packed when we came in for lunch. This place feels more like a home kitchen and the decor was average, not like Asian Legend. We waited for about 5 minutes for a table which wasn't too bad.   We ordered Fish Fillet in Hot Secret Chilli Oil, Stir Fried Spicy Chinese Cabbage, Chicken in Hot Secret Chilli Oil Soup, and Minced Pork & Pickled Long Bean Fried Rice.  The service was prompt and courteous. We got our orders pretty quickly.   First came the Fish Fillet in Hot Chilli Oil Soup.  For $13.99, we expect a lot more fish fillet. We didn't like the portions here.  The fish is bathed in chilli oil.  I mean most of it is chilli oil. I'd say 70% is chilli oil and the other 30% is fish fillet and bean sprouts. The taste however brings me back home. But spending $14, I'd expect more fish.  Second came the Chicken in Chilli Oil Soup. From looking at the menu, I thought the chicken is boneless but no I was wrong.  So I thought if it has bone then the chicken should be flavourful.  Wrong!  The chicken is not fresh, I could taste the chicken was left in the fridge for awhile. We'd probably not order this again.   Then came the Stir Fried Chinese Cabbage. This was the best dish!  This dish is flavourful, fresh and spicy. Delicious!  Last came the fried rice which we also enjoyed. This goes very well with the cabbage and the fish fillet.   By the end of our meal, I enjoy the food at this place but that chicken just tastes awful.  The bill came to roughly $48. Since I love numbing sensation and spicy food, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt for this time.   Food:  3.5/5 Ambience:  3/5 Service:  4/5 Cleanliness:  3.5/5"}
{"text":"I am wavering between a three or a four star because although the food is very good, the experience wasn't the best.   The chinese name of the restaurant is called \"ma la tang\" which literally translate to \"numb spicy boil\" and usually what it means is to have food cooked in a broth that's really hot and spicy. But rather than picking your own food to be cooked, they have a dish called exactly that but without any explanations of what is in the dish. We flagged down someone who is working there and given the attitude and his age and the way he was dressed, he seemed to be the owner. He had no interest in telling us what is inside the dish. He listed two items followed by, \"and stuff\".  We didn't order the dish.  We decided that we wanted to order this hot and spicy dish that we recognize the name of, which is a hot and spicy broth with pig's blood and intestines and my mom asked me what else i wanted, and I said i wanted something with vermicelli in it. we flagged down another waitress, made our orders, and asked for a dish that had vermicelli in it. She named one dish that we didn't want, and she was about to walk away when we asked her if that was the only dish that had vermicelli, she said no, and named one more dish. People there seriously were not interested in helping you.   The worst part? The first dish we ordered already had vermicelli in it and she didn't bother to tell us. We ended up ordering two dishes that had the exactly same ingredients but one was more sour and less spicy than the other.   Our third dish was a spicy vegetable that had no salt, so we asked them to add salt.  The total was $35 for the three dishes, not too bad.  I probably will come back, just because the actual spicy stuff were really good.  Oh, and beef noodle soup isn't really a szechuan specialty; I really wouldn't order it here."}
{"text":"Usually I am happy to please at a Northern Chinese Restaurants, just give me noodles, dumplings and something hot and spicy, I will be a happy camper. Unfortunately, Hot Spicy Spicy though has a cute name, it really does not deliver.  I found they make the food too salty. If mega salty=flavoured, then it is really flavoured dumplings and beef noodles. There are a lot of ways to make good tasting Chinese food by using garnish, sauces to give it a more complex taste.   The Spicy Cold Konjac  served here is made by mixing the jello with hot chili oil..  so it is just hot without being spicy.. other places use Sichuan pepper in the mix to give one the numbing, explosive spicy taste which is unique to Northern Chinese cuisine.  (Sichuan pepper has a unique aroma and flavour that is not hot or pungent like black or white pepper, or chili peppers. Instead, it has slight lemony overtones and creates a tingly numbness in the mouth (caused by its 3% of hydroxy-alpha-sanshool) that sets the stage for hot spices.)   Though the Lunch Special here starting from $5.99 which is great prices but I would not be back again.  They accepts cash only!"}
{"text":"What is wrong with people? On google this place is a 4.1 star restaurant. I was super excited to finally try this place based on online reviews. This place does not provide authentic spicy Sichuan cuisine. I mean, who puts celery in Kung pao chicken????? The last time someone put celery in their Kung Lao chicken was in HK and I walked out immediately. Avoid if you want authentic."}
