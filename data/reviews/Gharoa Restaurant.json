{"text":"Worst place ever in Canada! We went there as we were missing deshi food and thought they are like the ghoroa back in Dhaka. Foods quality are below average. Doesn't taste any better. Good for snacks and those who likes to have snacks with tea and have evening hangout like back in Bangladesh. But to me this place is a disaster. No proper order taking. You have ask again and again for your order. For us, the lady took the meal order in a scrap paper. Foods are unhygienic. Barely find any chair to seat!! Over crowded."}
{"text":"nice food , almost like home cooked . try going around 7 Pm and have the various deep fried items . must try \"muri makha\" and \"sandesh\" .."}
{"text":"This is the first time trying Bangladeshi food. Similar to Indian food in a way but different. I ordered goat and rice combo for take out. When I opened it, I gasped because of the generous amount of rice. There were enough rice for two people for sure. The goat curry was seriously delicious. Though it was spicy and hot, I could not stop eating. The soup included in the combo was potato soup and was really good. I'll definitely go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"My favourite spot to get authentic Bangladeshi food. This restaurant feels like home. It's decorated to mimic a bamboo hut. The food is delicious and reasonably priced. I always go for the kichuri with mangsho (beef curry) and it's always delicious! I would also recommend the singaras. They're the perfect mix between spicy and savoury. Their mango lassi in the summer is the perfect thing to cool you down from the heat!  Definitely my favorite spot when I'm in the mood for a home cooked meal."}
{"text":"5/5 for food. Authentic bangladeshi food. This is a small place in danforth so it's difficult to go there but i love the food. I also like the chaa and chotpoti"}
{"text":"Toronto doesn't have the largest Bengali population compared to other metropolis's (e.g New York, London and Los Angeles) but it is definitely a growing sub-culture.  Even tho some of the more esteemed \"Indian Food\" restaurants are Bengali owned and operated (e.g Copper Chimney), they tend to have more generic Indian choices (butter chicken, tikka masala). Items that are known to most people.  Gharoa is based in an area which has a high concentration of Bengali's and is one of the few places in this city where the menu is made and catered for authentic bengali food. It is a hole in the wall and the place is usually rammed (they have a giant staff) but the demand is thru the roof.  I was lucky enough to get a seat and order some fuchka- which is the bengali take on pani puri. It was delicious. I tried the Haleem and it was very good as well. I must agree with a reviewer from the past. The KACHI biryani was out of this world. I couldnt stop eating, even past the point of my hunger (large portion). I am sold.  Ghoroa translates to \"like home\" and my stomach agree's with that sentiment."}
{"text":"worst service ever they ask coustmer to clean the table after coustmer eat, what kind of restaurant is that ?? food even not good at all!!! As of im bengali requesting all of you do not go there!!! The worst place in the CANADA!!!"}
{"text":"Cheap food at hot spice levels served by gracious ladies. Hole in the wall popular with locals: that's it in a nutshell!"}
{"text":"If you want to try authentic Bangladeshi food, well then this is the place. A friend who himself is from Bangladesh and owns a restaurant in downtown recommended this place. You do feel like a homely feelings. Food is simple, clean, and very delicious. The only thing I will warn you though are the occasional customers on the phone. On my last visit I overheard a dude's self boasting detailed advise on how to keep ladies happy. I have strong doubts that he was talking to his imaginary friend. ;-) Back to food, this is worth the visit, try one or two pieces of everything- spread your choice range and you will find at least a few winners."}
{"text":"Best authentic Bangladeshi food in the GTA. I was craving home cooked Bangladeshi food and this place did not disappoint."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  A taste of my childhood in Calcutta. This is real Muslim style Indian food.  The meethai and puchka are fresh and amazing!!!  My cousin born in the Bangladesh area took my family here and it was an incredible experience!!!"}
{"text":"This place has really good Bangladeshi food. Amazing fuchka, tastes like the standard fare they sell in Dhaka. Tried the aloo puri and the chop as well. Really good. Best fuchka I've had so far in Toronto. Beats Lahore Tikka's fuchkas by miles and then some."}
{"text":"The taste of food reminds of home cooked food of Bangladesh. The name of the restaurant justifies the food. Food was not overly spicy and the quantity was very decent. The service however is not good . They are very disorganized ."}
