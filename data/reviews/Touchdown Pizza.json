{"text":"After visiting Kannapolis, I stopped for a lunch break at Touchdown Pizza, which is located in a quiet strip plaza.   The place is casual which has a takeout order counter and a spacious clean dining room with booths and tables, flatscreen TVs on the wall. The menu offerings include pizza, pasta, subs, salads, appetizers, desserts, Coke & Sun Drop beverages. Some of the named menu items have a football theme (bowls). Prices seem reasonable, most items under $9 with tax.They also offer several kinds of bottled beers.  For lunch takeout, I ordered an Individual Size Playoff Pizza ($4.29 plus tax), which was ready in under 20 minutes after ordering. The pizza was quite good, which was loaded with green peppers, onions, mushrooms, pepperoni, pork, beef, thick tomato sauce and melted browned cheese on a thin flat crust, crisp outside and soft inside. I actually enjoyed the pizza while sitting in I-85 construction traffic on the long (took almost an hour), but really a short ride (11 miles) to Concord."}
{"text":"It took us a while to finally give this place a chance, but when we finally did we couldn't help but feel like we had been missing out.  Now it's been a few months and every time we talk about getting pizza we always end up back at Touchdown.  Great pizza, great wings, very friendly people."}
{"text":"Just tried Touchdown Pizza for the first time. It's tucked away in a halfway deserted strip mall, but don't let that turn you away or you'll be missing out. My husband and I each got our own individual sized pizzas. They were a good individual size - I had half leftover to take home but my husband ate all of his. I got the Playoff Pizza and my husband got the Meatee. Both were delicious... Fresh toppings, great sauce, good hand tossed crust. And they were only about 5 bucks each. Also got the cheese bread, which was good too. Comfy booths, flat screen TVs on the wall, nice staff. Take out available. We'll definitely be back. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. My family and I thought we would give this a shot since it has been open for so long. The pizza was good and the prices were okay. Two large, three topping pizzas with cheese sticks for $25. Not bad! The restaurant itself is very nice and very clean, despite sporting a 92.5 sanitation grade. The pizza was tasty and was the best way to put it is just, good pizza. Even the worst pizza is edible so I don't try to be overly pretentious at pizza shacks. One bite and all your toppings come sliding off. Not a huge deal, I dip my pizza in ranch so I can deal with mess.   If you're bored with the usual then give this a shot."}
