{"text":"They overcharge you and don't expect you to find the charges. Be sure to inspect every charge on your bill when you stay here because they often cannot explain the charges."}
{"text":"Can't put lipstick on a pig!  Crazy loud and rowdy conventions and groups, soccer kids, baseball teams etc.  no problem unless you expected to sleep.  Never again."}
{"text":"The sales department at this location are dishonest, wishy washy, and horrible communicators. In planning accommodations for my out of town guests, I was told that there would be a shuttle to take guests to and from our venue. The day before our wedding, I confirmed with Andrew about the shuttle service and he confirmed that our guests can just call the front desk and they would radio the shuttle to pick guests up. On our wedding day, as we were taking photos downtown, our guests were calling saying that they did not have shuttle service. My groom had to spend time on the phone fighting with the manager on duty who stated, \"We don't do shuttle service for weddings\". When it was explained that Andrew had confirmed this the manager on duty stated \"That's not what Andrew told us\". Luckily after much time of being on hold with the manager on duty while they got their story straight they provided two shuttles at 11pm and 12am thanks to the efforts of one our groomsmen who took over while we enjoyed taking pictures. We will never recommend this hotel to anyone. Our day was absolutely perfect despite the interaction with this hotel!"}
{"text":"With so many other great restaurants in the area I should've trusted my instincts instead of eating in the hotel restaurant for convenience sake.

The service is horrendous. I ordered a salad which took over half and hour to arrive. After that, I had to look at it for another 5 minutes before my cutlery arrived. I only had to ask the waitress 3 times. The salad was not tossed...it just had the dressing squirted on top. Lastly, my drink was served in a disposal plastic cup reserved for picnics.

Save your time and money and eat somewhere that cares about their customer's experience."}
{"text":"Bar tender at this hotel (Jess) was extremely disrespectful and accused my husband of smuggling in beer because she forgot to take the cap off of the beer.  We spent $100 within 20 minutes really we would not tying to smuggle in a $4 beer.  She started to argue. She was trash!!  We also ask if they would provide a room for a pizza party for our hockey team and they refused.  I would recommend that anyone that has any tournament in Strongsville to not stay at this hotel or do not go to the bar."}
{"text":"The rooms were really nice, but I have dust allergies and the room sent me into a sneezing fit. Otherwise, the staff was nice. The hotel restaurant was decent, however the waitress was a little hurried. Decent experience overall."}
{"text":"Haven't stayed here in a long time, but live close and visit often; The bar and lounge has GREAT beer selection, Milk Stout in nitro, New Belgium and Dam Adams seasonals, Blue Moon, etc. Also a very good amount of scotch and bourbon including Oban and Basil Hayden's. Tasty appetizers and wings, steak from Del Monico's Steakhouse, in house cut chips and ground pork, and Ohio City pasta. For a hotel prices are quite reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Nice clean hotel. Free shuttle to and from the airport. 15 minute drive so make some time. They had a nice gym, pretty good pool area and the rooms are really nice for a Holiday Inn. Comfortable beds, flat screen, clean, nice view. 
The bar staff is amazing. Super quick and in top of their game. Food and drink was great. 
Wifi in the hotel is surprisingly fast. 
Also the hotel is in a great location. Close to parks, a mall and many other things that the driver will take you to as long as they're not swamped."}
{"text":"Not bad, $7 a beer, yes $7 per single draft beer. Keep in mind this is not the airport, just close to. Hotel is average for a Holiday Inn, parking a plenty. Just beware of the bar/restaurant highway robbery."}
{"text":"This a the worst hotel I have ever stated. It is no loud I don't think there is any insulation in the walls. The room is dirty I know they didn't clean the mirror has stuff all over it. I'm only here because of my job. There is no way I would ever stay here if I had a choice."}
{"text":"Booked this hotel on Priceline. They rated it a 3.5 out of 4. I'd say more like a 2.5 or 3 at best.  We heard kids running up and down the hallway till at least 1 am when we finally  got to sleep. The people in the room next to ours (at least 4 or 5 of them judging from the different voices) were having a loud party. I called the front desk to complain about midnight with absolutely no results. Called again at 12:40 am. The noise quieted down after that. Except for the kids running in hallway. Room wasn't bad, bed was way too soft. Will never go back."}
{"text":"This place is value for money,but I'm giving it 3 stars due to the lingering musty carpet smell.  Coffee maker takes half an hour to brew 2 cups but guest service is excellent."}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place is that the room was big and the king size bed was comfortable.  The negatives are that, the bathroom light was as bright as a night light, the curtains didn't completely cover the window, the overhead light flashed constantly, even when off (my husband had to drag a chair over to dismantle it), the batteries in the tv remote were dead (front desk wouldn't replace them, said maintenance had to do that, but maintenance never showed up)."}
{"text":"I check in late and they decided to be awesome and  saved me 25$ out of the 120 $ that was supposed to be so was a great start. Now. Bedroom was nice and clean but no mini fridge or microwave  so nothing to keep drinks and milk cold or just to heat up some food Downside of all to me was the TV lol takes for ever to change channels and tv has no guide channels. So u have to go trough them in order to see what's on  I didn't have breakfast or restaurant food.  Hope my review helps"}
{"text":"Just had a great night's sleep here- over nine hours!  I think it was the comfortable pillows.  Bar service last night was very good, as well.  Also, my wi-fi is working quite nicely.  First time to Cleveland in ten years. Good job."}
{"text":"This Holiday Inn is an older hotel that in my best estimate, has been updated within the last few years. The rooms are spacious and appear to be fairly clean. The work out facility also appeared to have some thought put into it, with 3 newer and fairly well maintained treadmills and a full set of dumbbells. The location isnt close to really much of anything except a gas station. But if you wan to get out of the hotel I highly recommend walking down to the nature park area and exploring some of the jogging paths and trails."}
{"text":"I stay here for a convention once a year, and this hotel treats us amazingly well considering the high concentration of loud, party-hungry residents that occupy the first 3 floors when we're there. The front desk is just great to us, and the cleaning and A/V staff seems amused by our madness.

The price is awesome, the rooms are always clean and comfortable (and smoke free!), and the parking is good. My only issue would be with the restaurant, which was hardly half full and the host was panicking and loudly complaining about how they were understaffed and too busy. Nothing unusual seemed to be happening at all yet he made us wait for 7 minutes for a table and seemed very irate the entire time.

I love this place, although I admit my experience is always seen through the fog of a very fun regular trip here. Still, I'd stay here again if it weren't for the conference, I just don't know if I'd ever have a reason to."}
{"text":"It was a clean hotel, warm bed but when it came time for my shower, the water wouldn't warm up. I called down to the front office about the issue and they offered me another room to take my shower, but I would have been late for the shuttle to the airport. It would've been nice if they told me to change rooms earlier so I didn't have to take a freezing cold shower.  I went downstairs to check out and was expecting an apology which I didn't get. I probably should give it one star but it did have comfortable beds."}
{"text":"I had to stay here because they canceled my flight. 

The rooms were clean and spacious. 

Good closet space. Easy to tuck away luggage. 

A generous sized desk with many charging outlets. 

The bathroom might have needed some renovations. 

The hospitality wasn't over the top. Very casual, actually. 

The kitchen stayed open till midnight."}
{"text":"This hotel is not accommodating without an attitude from the night staff. They also would not provide a mini fridge for my coworker who needed to store her breastmilk. They said they could put it in the fridge behind the front desk!!!! Very in accommodating and didn't even try to figure out another option to make us happy. Poor management staff and the staff was sitting around playing on their phones during this situation."}
{"text":"Had to come into town unexpectedly for a funeral and wanted a hotel close to my family.   For the Strongsville area, I would say this is the nicest hotel around.  Very close ( and viewable) from I-71, and close to the Ice Rink ( walking distance). 

The hotel itself was pretty reasonable for last minute and a weekend ( $90 a night)... the rooms were clean and they have a nice restaurant ( breakfast is NOT included :)).  They seems to have a lot of airline employees staying there and I saw a shuttle that was taking them back and forth, presumably to Cleveland Airport. 

They are close to just about everything just over the freeway.. target, CVS, Rite Aid, the Mall and several restaurants.   To the East of them there is a nice metropark system to enjoy hiking, walking, or ever driving.  

I will for sure stay here again, I have no problem starting up my points with these guys either. 

Great staff, stress free stay, during a very emotional time.

thank  you,"}
{"text":"1 star for the lady in the front desk for being nice but the bar lady is horrible.. fire her if you want better customer service 

She legit tells you she has 50 types of beers and shes not gona name any of them yet she doesn't even give you a menu to read 

Worst service ever"}
{"text":"I will give this hotel four stars for the VALUE! If you woke up in one of the rooms and didn't know you were in a Holiday Inn, you would think you were in a Hyatt or Sheraton....

The rooms are modern and the beds are very comfy. The bathrooms are updated and the showers have massage heads! They will provide toothpaste, razors etc. gratis. I will say that it bugged me that they had signs about being green and that the faucet had to be shut with precision to prevent it from dripping.

I would have rated the restaurant with two stars for food. The bartender/waitress was slammed but kept her composure. I was surprised the manager or one of the front desk girls didn't help her out."}
{"text":"I was in Strongsville 2 nights for business so I stayed at Holiday Inn. Got a 1 King Room for $119/night. After staying there, I definitely wouldn't pay that much again for this hotel. Bathrooms are very small and not much lighting at all. Was hoping for a breakfast that was atleast a buffet in their restraunt but they didnt have the buffet open either morning even though they had a buffet setup. Elevators were broken. 

Gym was nice, had dumbells, which is always a plus. Staff was very polite and helpful. This hotel is in a fantastic location so that was very nice. Was a good hotel, just wouldn't say it was anything special or above average."}
{"text":"While I liked the atmosphere and the cleanliness of the rooms, and even the staff's helpfulness when something went wrong (we got free beers for a 25 minute check in) I thought the price was high given the amenities. The location off the highway and the nearby parks were a nice plus. Everyone involved in our groups wedding reception was professional and helpful and I was quite happy with them."}
{"text":"For the value we got, I wasn't too impressed with this hotel. I realize it's a national chain so I wasn't expecting something fancy, but I have seen much nicer holiday inns for better value. The bar area was nice and convenient and they had a little cafe in the lobby as well. The rooms were a little small and a little dingy, but nothing bad. Overall, it was just very average. The location is nice though as it is pretty close to the aiport and right down the street from the mall and lots of restaurants."}
{"text":"Great hotel, close to the airport and I-80. Rooms on the freeway side are a little noisy, so make sure you request a room on the parking lot side. Food in the bar was also above average for a hotel chain. The staff is also friendly and helpful if you need directions to anywhere nearby."}
{"text":"I am rating this hotel three stars, but for the price I paid ($40/night on Priceline), it really deserves four stars for the value.  It is 10-15 minutes from the Cleveland Airport, near an ice skating rink and a shopping center (I noticed a Dillards and a Target), yet near some picturesque wooded hills that we would have explored if we had time.  There are picnic tables perfect for families too.

The decor was tasteful (see the photos we posted), the gym was well equipped and empty, the pool was big and the staff was mostly helpful (changed our room to a king when we were assigned two double beds by Priceline, gave us apples and juice for free, offered helpful info to other guests).

On the downside, some of the locals who frequent the bar are obnoxious, our bathtub drain was clogged and we thought the maid would notice it when she cleaned the tub and would fix the problem, but she didn't, raising the question of whether she bothered to clean the tub (and other areas???) at all!  The toiletries are stored on a shelf above the toilet and I accidentally knocked them into the toilet several times.  Also, we noticed a sewer smell outside one of the days we stayed there.

My husband and I disagree on the following:
He liked the sampler platter at the bar, and I didn't like the bar food.  I thought the bed was comfy, but he found it lumpy.

Overall, this hotel isn't perfect, but it is a great value, on par with a Courtyard Marriott.  I would definitely stay here again, especially at the price."}
{"text":"Not a bad hotel, although we did have some hangups. Caitlan in reception so sweet and welcoming! But, once we got to our room, there was a big wet spot on the floor (which is carpet). My boyfriend stepped in it, so that's how we unfortunately noticed it. They immediately switched our rooms, which was great. The first elevator we tried to use didn't work. We kept pushing our floor number... but nothing happened. That sent me into a full blown panic attack because the door would not open for a minute. We took the stairs from there on out.Ha!
Later that night we ate at Vinney's Bar, which is inside the hotel. We ate here strictly for convenience. The waitress brought our drinks and then we didn't see her again for about 14 minutes or so. My boyfriend had to get up and go look for her. When she came back she said, \"Not gonna lie guys, I forgot about you!\" Honesty is the best policy, I guess? Our food was sub par. Very salty and overly seasoned. (She did give us a discount and apologized for forgetting about us! She was very nice.) There is no continental breakfast here, which if you ask me is ridiculous. What saves this place is the friendly staff!
*I wanted to edit my review to include that we found used towels on the back of the bathroom door that were not ours. Lovely."}
{"text":"We've stayed here at least 10 times and like the location. This visit was tainted by the front desk woman Katherine who could not have been any more rude. We called and spoke to Caitlin who could not have been nicer to see if we could check in early as we had arrived ahead of schedule. She assured us that our room would be ready and told us to come in. Upon arrival Caitlin was busy with another guest. We were approached by a woman who didn't have a name tag. She said nothing but just looked at me. I said I would like to check in. She asked if I had stayed here before and I answered yes. She said the code for the internet had not changed. I said I was unable to remember it from my last stay and I received a stare then she wrote it down. We were given a room on the 4th floor and we hauled our luggage to the room.  Someone had just left and it was not prepped and actually was disgusting. I called the front desk and she told me that she thought the room was ready and would check to see if something else was available. I asked since we were in the building and on the 4th floor could she see if there was anything in that rae so we wouldn't have to transport luggage to another area of the hotel as one of the two elevators was down. She said hold on and she would check. Now were sitting in someones dirty room and on hold for 10 minutes. I left my wife on hold and walked to the front desk where this person was sitting down chatting while my wife was still sitting on the phone in the dirty room. No apologies she just gave me a room on the 5th floor and turned away.  I called the next shift at the front desk and asked that the manager call me which never happened.

Really makes ya wonder how people survive in the service industries with that kind of personality.  In the two conversations I had with her she said \"What' to me at least 6 times.  Sorry HI but you need some trained staff as the face of your company."}
{"text":"This hotel is a nice & basic hotel

But there were some thing that didn't make our stay 5 stars

We checked in on Friday and everything was ok beside some minor issues in the room so here's a list

Door didn't close all the way

The elevator smelled like cigarettes (hotel staff cleaned it the next day)

There's a LOT more

We went to the bar to go and get some food and drinks and everything was fine there
After that we went right to bed after watching half an hour of modern family

The next day we were out all day so no evidence for that day

So next day we went downstairs to get breakfast the restaurant was very nice

After breakfast I'm one out through the room just to chill out so after that I went downstairs to see were my other family member was and they found him he was still waiting for the check so I told him that I would be in the room or in the hallways or something so I got in the elevator and went up to four which was the floor my room was on Let me just say that those elevators were crap they were just falling apart, so when I got to four the door literally would not open so I waited for about five minutes until I pressed one and it moved so then I went back up to 4

So after that we were headed off to a wedding

So after that we just came back to change our clothes and shower

After that we went to bed

So the next morning was Monday

We woke up and showered and left


So this hotel is satisfactory"}
{"text":"Bad all the way around. Was booked here for 15 nights. Reservations were not there even though I had a confirmation number and 2 emails confirming the room. Found hair all over the bathroom floor and trash can. Tub would not drain so I asked to have someone look at it while I was at work the next day. Was gone from 6 am to 5:30 pm. Guess what no one looked at issue with tub. Had to go through the hassle of moving to another room. Fourth night into my stay and a group of college kids check in. 3 am all hell breaks loose outside my room. I talked to night manager and was told the cops had already been there and there was nothing she could do. Checked out a 4:30 am. Worst Holiday inn ever."}
{"text":"I have stayed here twice now, traveling between the East Coast and Midwest, to visit family. Both times have been great. I was a little scared the first time when I pulled up and saw the super old exterior, but the interior is actually very nice. The rooms appear to have been recently redone, are large and comfortable. The staff both times has been very friendly. If I need to be near I-80 this is my choice in the Cleveland area. Recommended!"}
{"text":"This is a great single-night hotel option for the interstate-weary traveller, and a superb value overall.  I don't think that I've ever been treated so well by a hotel getting less than a hundred bucks a night from me (in this case, way less--$81 through hotels dot com).

First off, the service was with a smile, and an apology, as they did not have any more king rooms despite our \"reservation\" and pre-pay.  So they comped us two breakfasts and two drinks at the bar.

That bar?  Way better than you'd expect.  It's open (kitchen too) until 1:30am.  They have separate bar and lounge areas.  The beer list is impressive for a hotel bar and included Guinness and Great Lakes Dortmunder.

And the breakfast?  Well, it wasn't the most delicious I've had, but it was just fine, and the service was just as pleasant as the front desk staff.

How about some other positives?

+  Free wifi throughout the building, with no password needed
+  Less than two miles from I-80
+  Multiple \"Firm\" and \"Soft\" pillow options per bed, all labelled
+  Shower:  the water pressure and temperature control were a-ok
+  There were a wedding party and guests staying there, and the hotel had decked out the entry archway and lobby area

+/-  The room decor was nice, with rich, deep earth tones and a couple of paintings of lonely trees that I really liked.  However, there was a slight musty smell to the carpets that was more pronounced in the hallway areas.

These people obviously take pride in their guest experience, regardless of their price point.  That earns big kudos from me."}
{"text":"What a surprisingly nice Holiday Inn!  Especially when you consider that one night's stay costs around $60.  First, there is the decor.  The decor here is quite attractive (lots of warm, earthy colors)- on par with some Hilton hotels I've been in.  And it's not just the lobby that looks great- the rooms have the same lovely, modern decor.  No tacky pale pink walls with large framed paintings of sailboats! Thank goodness.

On top of the modern decor, the rooms have very modern amenities.  There is the free Wi-Fi (though I found it kinda unreliable with my phone).  The spacious bathrooms with very nice showers- no problems with water temp or pressure.  And the beds were neither too soft nor too firm- just right, Goldilocks-style :P

In terms of other amenities, there is an indoor pool, a fitness room with multiple TVs, and a very nice bar/dining/lounge area.  The bar has a surprisingly good beer selection and the kitchen is open until 1:30am for the late-night munchie crowd. I highly recommend trying their burgers- mine was delicious! Best 1am burger ever!

Recap: great rooms, great bar area, low price.  I highly recommend this hotel, for the high quality you get at such a low price! I have paid way more for sh-ttier places."}
{"text":"Prepare ahead if you need a lift to a local spot. I prepaid to see a movie at 12:45 at a theatre less than a mile away. I went down to request transportation that morning and was told that they were really busy and the first available shuttle was at 2:30. I was given 2 numbers for local cab companies (Ace and Yellow Taxi) and neither showed up after trying both of them, for over an hour. Missed my show and watched the Holiday Inn van sit there, not busy at all. The drive would have taken them 5 min to the Theatre and 5 min. back. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"back in Ohio to undertake the final preparations for our home sale.  We stayed at the Holiday Inn in Strongsville, which is the closest full service hotel to our home in Hinckley.  I had seen photos of these beautifully renovated guest rooms on their web site and was looking forward to the hotel being someplace where Chuck could relax at the end of our stressful days, with access to a wheelchair-compatible bathroom and shower.  Well, we stayed in Room 106, and I promise it hasn't been renovated in the last ten years, maybe even 20, and was not worth half of what I paid.  

- The 'ADA/accessible' guest bathroom was very unsafe for wheelchair-bound Chuck, so the home health care aides had to shower him at our home in Hinckley while we were trying to get everything out of it.  The hotel had a conventional, old, bathtub, with a slide chair to access it.  The slide chair looked like it was falling apart and on a  permanent slant.  I was afraid to have Chuck try it as it definitely did not look safe.
- The room barely fit the king bed, nightstands and dresser.  The aisles were so narrow, I could only get the wheelchair to the bottom corner of the bed, so he was essentially confined to that side of the bed once we were in our room.
- We stayed for 6 nights, unfortunately covering the \"Cinema Wasteland Movie and Memorabilia Expo, from Friday through Sunday of the week we were there. 
- The hotel had no control over their property on Friday and Saturday nights; people were shouting, fighting, banging on guest room doors, setting off fire alarms, and ultimately bringing the police to quiet things down.  This despite a prominent sign in the lobby stating that \"quiet hours after 10 pm are strictly enforced.\"
- During the midst of the Saturday night mayhem, I called the front desk because there was a man and woman screaming at each other at the top of their lungs and yelling profanity-laced remarks at each other.  The front desk phone rang for 9 minutes without being answered.  I finally hung up.  If I had an emergency, I would not have received any aide from the hotel.
- The front entrance was full of people smoking and the back of the first floor hallway was oppressive smelling of cigarette smoke.
-When I complained to a manager, on Sunday morning, I was offered a \"free breakfast,\" which I promptly declined because  I already had 'free breakfast' coupons, but had not been using them because we did not care for the breakfast the two days we did try it!  He then went on to tell me, 'well, at least this weekend only happens once a year.'  

Chuck has a neurological disorder and the unceasing noise and commotion was beyond difficult for him to handle.  I don't care that it only happens once a year; since the Holiday Inn apparently thinks that's acceptable, I believe they should at least warn their other guests who aren't attending that event so they can make an informed decision as to whether to stay at this property or not.  There were other people there with small children on their spring break from school.  I can only imagine the worry their parents had over what these kids were exposed to.  Shame on the hotel for not warning people who were not there for this event.  They clearly know what to expect and choose to ignore it; both literally and figuratively."}
{"text":"I have been to more than one Holiday Inn in my days. You can always tell how old they are the second you step out of your car. This Holiday Inn appears to be a bit on the older side and is starting to show signs of its age. I ended up on the \"Executive Level\" and while the room had all the amenities I needed it was also showing its age. There were a few stains here but nothing gross. The windows (which use to open I guess) had a sign on them saying they didn't open and were glued shut. 

Things changed when I got on the wireless network. It was much faster than any other hotel network I had been on. I know for some people this isn't a big deal but as a geek I am a big fan of plenty of bandwidth. In the morning I got breakfast at the built in restaurant. The food was good and surprisingly fairly priced for a hotel restaurant. I have had the same breakfast in other places and paid double. A little TLC and this place could be a four easy. As it stands it is clean, the services are good, and really not a bad place to stay."}
{"text":"Great hotel that we stay at for our overnights and I love that the staff is always helpful and smiling:o)  Walking distance to shopping, and an ice rink that offers open skating in the evening.  The rooms are updated, beds are super comfortable, there's an indoor pool and small fitness area that does the trick."}
{"text":"The hotel itself was pretty nice, bed was comfortable, staff was friendly, wifi was fast, it's exactly what you would expect from a Holiday Inn. But the walls were paper thin. I could hear everything in the hallway, and I could hear my neighbor's TV like it was in my room. The most important thing to me about a hotel room is being able to sleep, and with the noise in the hallway and being able to hear the TV from next door I could not fall asleep and I was awoken several times. Based on that I can't recommend this location."}
{"text":"The Simmering Pot and Vinnies Lounge are GREAT!! The employees are so friendly and the food is delicious, the Eggplant Parm sandwich was amazing, (even without the bun) portions were good sizes also! I wouldn't mind staying here again knowing they have great food options!"}
{"text":"We had a good experience here on a Wednesday night. I booked the room through Priceline and got a great deal, especially given heavy business travel on this side of town. The front desk was very helpful and check in was super fast. I requested a room change from one King bed to two doubles, no problem. Priceline says \"max two guests\" but we had four (two adults, two shorties) and the hotel didn't make me pay extra. 

This is an older property dressed up and renovated. The rooms are smallish but we made it work. The renovation updated the colors, carpet, and bathroom decor, but they left the old toilets in place with their giant water hog tanks. Sustainability is for suckers!"}
{"text":"Stayed at this hotel for two periods of 2 nights while visiting family in the Cleveland area.  Upon check-in at just after 4pm, was notified that the room would be ready in a couple of minutes and was given vouchers for a free breakfast for my 2 night stay.  The room was ready in a couple of minutes and upon arrival in the room, noticed that the room had a refrigerator and microwave which was nice.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  The room on both stays was comfortable and clean.  The restaurant was nice with good food and the bar was pretty nice too.  I would definitely stay here again."}
{"text":"If I had to describe this hotel in one word? Surprising. 

My husband and I came through here twice on a road trip from Indianapolis to upstate New York for the July 4th weekend. After 5 hours on the road, after an 8-hour day of work, we were both pretty exhausted. Thankfully, my brilliant husband made a reservation for a king executive room a week prior to our arrival. Lovely! At check-in, the desk clerk said that king rooms are reserved for handi-capable guests because they are handicap accessible. She continued to ask us if we wanted a room with two double beds instead. She really didn't explain all this very well at the time, and we were too exhausted to make sense of why we couldn't have the room we reserved.

The room itself was ok, but didn't fit our needs. We ask for a larger bed because my husband needs the space to sleep properly due to medical reasons. Also, the tap dripped constantly and no fridge/microwave. Double bummer. In the morning, my husband spoke with the hotel manager about the mix-up and how it caused him to not get enough sleep. She set up up with free breakfast, 10,000 points, and a complimentary stay on our way back to Indy. 

Restaurant food was pretty tasty and moderately priced. I had the Mediterranean omelette and the summer salad. We also noticed that they had a free shuttle to the airport, indoor pool, and a fitness room. WiFi was fast and the hotel is right off the highway.

The following Sunday, we finally received the king executive room, with a king bed, fridge AND microwave, and complimentary breakfast. Everything the second time around was perfect. I just wish it was like that the first time."}
{"text":"I wish there was a negative rating possible. This hotel is excellent competition in the \"most disgusting hotel\" challenge. The carpets are filthy, the rooms are in beyond terrible condition, and the manager probably couldn't care any less. 
Construction was being done outside during my stay which was understandable but the workers were playing loud music right outside my window while they were working and they continued to work all the way past 7PM which is ABSOLUTELY unacceptable. A hotel is a place of rest and relaxation, and late construction work while loud music is being played is just shameful. 
I asked the front desk twice to ask the workers to lower the music and finally called Intercontinental Hotels Group and complained, and this finally got the mangers attention that I was extremely upset. After a half hour he went outside and got the men to lower the music, and this was at nearly 7PM. They turned it off and then the front desk called me back and said I could change rooms if I wanted but the men were going to be working and playing music the next day as well.

Unbelievable."}
{"text":"I'm a Crew member so pretty convenient they open until pretty late, varies from midnight up to 2 am.  During Christmas a seasonal beer with cinnamon sugar is great.  All wings are good but my favorite Cajun dry rub. Classic BBQ are awesome as well.  Indoor pool area it's unexpected big size with pool and hockey table. Small gym but clean.  Recently renovated rooms.  Comfy beds.

{"text":"I wouldn't choose this place. Morning front desk is a sour looking lady who doesn't smile or look you in the face. There was an extension cord in the middle of my floor. As of this date there is remodeling, which is sorely needed. The restaurant closes at 1p and the bar food is expensive and sub par. Found dirty towels behind my bathroom door. When I told them about it, not so much as an apology. Lastly, their Internet is a pain to try to access."}
{"text":"Hotel options are fairly limited in Strongsville, so I checked into the Holiday Inn with higher expectations compared to the alternatives.  My expectations were not met.

On the positive side, the staff are great... always greeting me with a smile.  In fact, one employee graciously offered to help me carry my bags down the stairs to the lobby because the elevators were not working.

Despite all the friendliness and helpfulness, this hotel needs some serious attention.  Among my list of things to get right are...

1) Improve the comfort of the bed linens.  My sheet was old and felt like cheesecloth... sticking to my skin.. and keeping me awake.  My pillows were lumpy and felt like they were stuffed with old socks.  The blanket did not breath well and trapped my body heat.  So, each night I had to remove it.

2) Make sure the cleaning staff is on top of maintenance.  I had to go to the front desk to get replacement toiletries because I ran out.  One day my room was not cleaned and I had to remove leftovers from the garbage.

3) Keep the exercise equipment in top shape.  The exercise room is small and only has a few machines... which is all the more reason why it's important to maintain this equipment.  I cycle a lot and was looking forward to using their only resistance bike.  The resistance on it wasn't working.  So, I jumped on a treadmill but it wasn't recording my activity.

4) Keep the elevators smelling fresh... or simply not smelling at all.  Often when I would enter any of the elevators, I was met with a strong industrial cleanser smell.

5) Maintain the elevators.  On the day I checked out, I waited at the main elevator bank for nearly 10 minutes.  I then flagged down an employee and he told me they were not working.  Two of two elevators were down and there was no sign to inform guests."}
