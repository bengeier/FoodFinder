{"text":"Had the falafel Damascus wrap and it was delicious! The falafel was really soft and the sauce was good. Their tahini sauce is amazing too. I ordered a side of fries which were super cheap and nice and salty!"}
{"text":"I ordered the cauli sandwich - spicy. Tasted so fresh and very well seasoned. I ordered one last week as well and was craving it. Haven't tried anything else but will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Ordered two chicken Shawarma dinners from this place and was left hungry and still wanting. Can't believe what they considered a dinner plate. It was just chicken shawarma, which was dry and tasteless, a garlic sauce that had no garlic flavour,  no real salad or rice.  Just a piddly amount of french fries...not even considered a small fries portion for on Macdonalds. All this was $12.99 a plate. Would definitely never go back or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after shopping at Dixie Mall. I've had a lot of shawarma in Toronto and I've gotta say that this little place is really some of the best shawarma I've had in the city. Glad we found this place because there aren't a ton of good options in the area."}
{"text":"My friend and I came to try out this restaurant in our neighborhood based on the good reviews of others.  We were greeted warmly by the owner of who took our order.  We decided to try the shawarma X.  As we were waiting, the woman who works there offered both of us some lentil soup with crisp to try.  It was delicious and such a good surprise.  The owner personally prepared the order while we waited in one of their comfortable tables. We truly enjoyed the Sharma X, the dipping sauce is good and the pickles and pickled cabbage are unlike any we have tasted. The prices here is very reasonable, food tasty and the place is very clean. The best part is their friendly service.  I would be back here weekly for lunch.  Highly recommended.  I can't wait to try the baklava.
Just tried the baklava and it tasted superior to the baklava we purchase from the pastry stores.  The honey is less sweet, the pastry crispy and the pistachio is fresh and toasty.  It goes so well with a cup of espresso!"}
{"text":"The schwarma poutine is phenomenal, I'd eat one every day if I could. Also grabbed an order of the cut up schwarma wrapped in flour tortilla and shared it with friends while drunk, a wonderful idea. Thanks for existing Lakeshore Falafel"}
{"text":"Went for a shawarma at 6:30 and they were sold of of chicken no one was in the restaurant and no music was playing I did have the falafel it was good and I asked for pink turnip in mine and the owner added it. I will go back to try the shawarma (if it's not sold out) but they should play music in there it was weird waiting in complete science"}
{"text":"The strangest thing about the shawarma plate is that it comes on a pita instead of rice which I've never seen before. It was harder to eat but lemme tell you, this was the BEST tasting chicken I've ever had. Every bite was perfection. The cook, the texture, and the taste...mmm."}
{"text":"Note:  This place wasn't super fast, so don't expect heat lamp speed service.  Falafel was about a 15min wait.  I believe they make everything fresh to order!

First, strange name 'cause this place isn't located anywhere near Lakeshore.  I guess it sounds better than QEW Falafel!

Based on my falafel takeout, this place really hit the spot!  It was near my physio appointment, getting somewhat late, and I didn't want anything to sit in my stomach and give me nightmares.

The man at the counter, who I assumed to be the owner, was very warm and friendly.  I asked which was better, the falafel or the shwarma.  Then, I added that I haven't had a falafel in a while, so I decided to get that.  PLUS, it's sort of the namesake of the restaurant, so...

This place is across the highway from Dixie Mall and, to be honest, I'm rarely in this area.  And I had to wait approx. 15-20mins to eat my falafel.  When I got home, it was delicious!  Definitely would've been nicer to eat it fresh, but it was still crunchy and a bit spicy as I requested.

I owner said that I should return to try the shwarma, and I'm going to comply, happily!  :)"}
