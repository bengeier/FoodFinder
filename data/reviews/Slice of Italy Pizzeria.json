{"text":"Finally a place that makes good fresh pizza consistently and not overly salty and perfect amount of toppings. I've never found a pizza place in the Vaughan area that I've ever gone back to as they're all awful. I'm used to home made pizzas but this place is now our go-to when we need a break from making our own."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza online through my mobile which was seamless. Pizza was delicious. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Constant disappointment. Don't get me wrong, the food tastes good... when they make it right. They screw up my order 9 out of 10 times. They forget toppings, or put the wrong ones. Somebody I was with ordered artichokes in their panzerotto and got anchovies instead. I'm a vegetarian, if that was my order I would've been furious.

On the rare occasions that my order is correct, my food is inevitably burned. One time they forgot my order completely! I've continued to order from there because there aren't really any other options around, but I've decided that I will never go back again."}

{"text":"Been through a few owners over the years but the recipe for great pizza has remained the same. The prices are very competitive including two slices and a drink for $5.95 which is a great way to try it out without hitting your wallet too hard. 

I would recommend this place to anyone without any reservations. I can only vouch for the pizza though."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the hidden gems for pizza. 
I can't say enough regarding how amazing the food is here. I'm a regular customer now, Occasionally my girlfriend and I will order their huge Ponzarotti to, but she`s obsessed with the thin crust pepperoni.
 will be going back their in a couple of day to try their pasta, i`ll let you know how it ends up.

 Food: Excellent
 Decor: Very good 
Service: Excellent"}
{"text":"lazy sunday and i needed dinner...

on the phone i pre-ordered the large pepperoni pizza walk in special... 
online it said 9.50$... but when i got in they had it priced for 7.50$!?!

It was salty and greasy (but not too much -- the way i like it)...
Wife wasn't hungry but join me in polishing off pretty much the entire pizza...

Was a great deal.. 
And will definitely think of guys over the various \"pizza chains\" in the area next time..."}
{"text":"Love this pizza place! It's run by a sweet middle aged couple - a mom and pop joint! Prices for pizza are reasonable but always have the party size pizza on special for $14.95 - the lowest price in Vaughan! They're pastas are amazing too and have a variety of menu items to choose from .. if you go in at lunch, they have fresh slices on special for $5.95 with a free pop! DEFINITELY recommend this place and would go here again and again!"}
