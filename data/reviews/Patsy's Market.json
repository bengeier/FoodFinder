{"text":"Ok.  So I grabbed a package of hot sausage while I was here.  Just cooked it.  Best hot sausage I have ever had.  I know there is a famous hot sausage place in Verona.  I think this is it.  Holy cow.  Try it"}
{"text":"Probably the best hot sausage in the city- if not the country- seriously that good.

The owners, a husband and wife team, can be eccentric. I once asked for mayo on my Italian hoagie and got a lecture on why it doesn't need it and I couldn't have it...this was after a lecture on why their steaks are better than the local grocery store's. 

If you can handle a little preaching, then their food is great and worth it.

SPOILER ALERT
They never did give me that mayo- but I take them home and add it without their knowledge!"}
{"text":"Not a bad little market, I just stopped in for a drink but they seem to have a nice sandwich menu. The place seems clean and the staff are friendly. I recommend a visit if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Patsy's is a great little gem of a market/deli tucked on a side street in Verona, PA. They do a bunch of meats in house and homemade wedding soup. The hot sausage and meatball hoagies are excellent and everything is reasonably priced. To top it all off, the owners are so friendly and welcoming. I highly recommend this spot and am proud to support this small local business."}
{"text":"This place is an old school Italian deli that treats their customers with respect. The prices are unbelievably good and usually cheaper than Giant Eagle.  The sandwiches they make in particular the homemade meatball is some of the best I have ever had.  Reminds me of the meatballs my Italian grandma would make on Sundays.

They also have a wide variety of homemade sausages that taste great and are not full of filler fat.  When you bite in all you see is meat and not those little white balls of fat you get from Giant Eagle

I highly recommend this place if your looking for a small family run deli with fair prices and exceptional service."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and fresh meat, I have lived in 5 different states including new york city and this is by far the best food I have tasted, there are no preservatives in the meat and it's extremely tender. I stopped here because I was a little curious and I'm glad I did. Owners were very nice. I ordered and meatball and ruben and got some sausage."}
{"text":"This is the best deli in the area. Go here if you want fresh meats and cheeses. Their specialties for the day are always delicious Italian meals just like mom used to make. If you want an authentic Italian grocer experience, come to Patsy's."}
