{"text":"I was with a group of 4 other people and we were excited about trying this new place out. We were celebrating, so we were eager to try out the milkshakes that have been all over social media, but first we had drinks, apps, and our meal. Our experience started out fine. The service was kind of slow (15 minutes to get drinks and forgot to put in our appetizer) and half of our group had ordered the Mahi sandwich, which they were apparently out of, which was disappointing. but overall all the drinks were extremely tasty and the food was pretty good (although the calamari and waffle fries could have been fried longer). Our favorite was the dive sauce and sweet potato fries. Then we ordered a round of the XXX Milkshakes (what we had originally came here for). Apparently it was \"Media Day\" and these bloggers or whatnot started showing up right after we placed our order, which apparently means that everyone dropped everything to cater to them while they wandered around taking photos of everything. Our table was right next to their section of tables, so we got to watch while they got food, drinks, more food and more drinks, while 30 minutes after placing our order, we still had nothing and hadn't seen our server in that long either. By this point, we had been there more than 2 hours and eventually I went to the hostess stand to cancel our order and just get the check. When our waitress finally came over, her excuse was \"they didn't have a milkshake maker in house that day\".....Isn't that what you're trying to be known for?  We were extremely disappointed and for a celebration dinner, it was very anticlimactic and did not end on a good note."}
{"text":"I am only giving one star because the staff were very friendly. Service was slow, though, and the restaurant was less than half full. The two shakes that our group had were not very good at all. The peach tasted like vanilla and the Oreo was only slightly better and they were topped with Cool whip, not whipped cream. Their calamari was mildly ok served with what tasted like marinara from a jar and not even the yum yum sauce they described. The wings were decent. The philly steak and cheese was ok. The menu stated a blackened mahi sandwich and they said it's actually haddock. That was fine except when they brought it out, it tasted like an entire bottle of seasoning had been dumped on it and I had to order a ranch sauce to smother it and make it barely edible (and I don't normally like much sauce). The seasoned fries were pretty good and basically all I ate for my lunch. The prices are extreme for such poor quality food. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really like the new setup here. I honestly didn't have high expectations, but was pleasantly surprised. Did prices were reasonable, and drinks we're better then average with great prices.   Service was really good. One server did screw up the tab and tried to cover herself (further screwing it up) but the bartender (Lea?) Totally made up for it.   Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Food was great! Service however was one of the worst I've experienced.  Walked in and the staff appeared disorganized. The hostess left her stand when we walked in and came back 5 min later and then greeted us. I went thru half my meal without my drink then we ran out of water and ranch. We went through our whole meal without plates for our shared dishes. They also left people's empty plates on surrounding tables just looked sloppy."}
{"text":"I came here over the weekend to check this place out and I was pleased with the food, but dissatisfied with my service. It took a while for my food to come and my server clearly was taking on too much at once. The food was amazing but the service quality was poor. Get your staff up. I've been working in the restaurant industry for years, and for the volume of people, they don't have enough workers."}
{"text":"I was really excited about the newly opened Rosemont. I was expecting a nice place to get fun cocktails in south end. Sadly it was not that way.  A group of 4 friends and I went on a Friday night around 8:30/9. Inside, everything has a red tint and the music is set to a level only rivaled by an EDM club. We walked in and asked the host for a table for 5. She told us it would be around 20-30 minutes and took down our number.  We walked to the back patio to get drinks. We decided to get normal drinks until we sat down. The house vodka sodas and house whiskeys were very cheap ($3) and expectedly not tasty. The back had some tables with umbrellas, a small bar, large beer pong, jenga, and some random seating. The back definitely seems unfinished and an after thought. There are garage like doors to the inside that were open. It was person to person inside and outside. The bathroom stalls in the women's restroom don't lock and appear that they have been around for 15 years and not 2 weeks of being open. Upon ordering a second round of drinks the bartender told us she was out of house vodka and only had Tito's. After asking her when she could get house (as the bar is next to back of house and 20 feet from the other bar) she just stared at us. She ignored the question and asked if we wanted Tito's. We gave in and these drinks were $10 a piece and also terrible. There was a DJ there playing 2000s music, as stated earlier, extremely extremely loud.   We stood around for about 50 minutes before asking about our table. The host told us she had given away our table because she called us and no one came. Upon checking our phones and having no missed calls we asked her what number she called. She had written down the correct number but called the wrong one. She had no sympathy and no apology. She did not offer to give us the next table. Absolute horrible service. We left without ever trying a fun drink and and without ever being seated."}
{"text":"After readingsome of the mixed reviews, I still wanted to give Rosemont a chance. I was hoping that this place would surmount th curse of this location and the Bottle Cap Group would have a winner with this location. Sadly, I was disappointed.   Let's start with the positives. Their drink menu is great and reasonably priced. And their food prices are reasonable as well. I like how they added the front and rear patios to have outside seating. Our service was good an our server did the best she could despite the loud music.   Now on to the not so good news. The parking at this location has always been horrible-it's awkward, tight and not a lot of spaces, so beware. On Friday night's, they have live music. The band was pretty good but it was incredibly loud in there. It was so loud that I couldn't even hear my friend sitting next to me and trying to have conversation with my friend on the other side of the table was out of the question. We had to yell our order to our server. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with a side of te he seasoned fries. The burger came as two small stacked patties with two pieces of bacon. The burger patties weren't seasoned and didnt have any flavor. Th seasoned fries weren't seasoned at all. You can tell that they're the frozen fries that have the seasoning in the batter. The fries weren't cooked all the way through and they just didnt taste good.  Overall I'm giving it 2 stars because of the food, it just wasn't stellar. If I come back, it'll solely be for the \"liquor bar\" drinks and it wont be on a Friday night, I could barely hear and have a conversation with the loud music."}
{"text":"Awesome new place! Great drinks. Adult capri suns!! And try the mac n cheese... heard they have live music on the weekends. Cant wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes for my milkshake, my server never even came back during that time to see if I wanted to order food or bring me a water or anything. I ordered the nachos with no jalape√±os and that was wrong too. Overall a thumbs down and highly disappointed. Sad because I was so excited about this place :("}
{"text":"Still very new. A few kinks, but overall good! Buffalo dip app and the cheeseburger were great, mac & cheese (oddly) was not good, my Cobb salad would have been great if they hadn't drowned it in ranch. I'm not a \"light dressing\" type and it was way too much, inedibly so. I didn't complain bc I was full from the dip anyway. So for salads I would recommend asking for dressing on the side, as their default is to mix in. Adult \"Capri Sun\" style drinks called Soccer Mom Special were great and refreshing. The birthday milkshake w/ a cupcake on top was delicious- got it virgin- didn't try it with alcohol, as my 10 y/o was the one who ordered it. Picture of the milkshake is inside beside silverware bc we got rained out on the porch, went inside and there was nowhere available to sit (busy)."}
{"text":"Everything was simply amazing. If you stop through be sure to check out their daily drink specials. I lived in Texas for two years & became spoiled by HH specials, so its awesome to find cheap drink specials in Charlotte too!  The bacon cheeseburger is bae. & I definitely enjoyed the peach ring soccer mom. OMG!!!!...THE CRINKLE CUT SEASONED FRIES ARE BAE TOO! To top off the great burger, fries, & drink our waitress truly enjoyed her job & was extremely pleasant. Sooooo, we'll probably be here every weekend. I look forward to finding more gems like this in my hometown."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! The food is average. Fries were cold, Mac and cheese was watery, and the bologna sandwich was extremely salty and had very little onions, chili and cheese on it.  The lettuce in the salad looked like it had been sitting in dressing for hours. The wings were decent.        I can not explain how bad our server was. I won't put her name on here but our experience started with waters that tasted way to chlorinated.  We asked for new ones from the soda machine as that water would be filtered. We were told it was, but she brought new ones and amazingly they tasted much better.  Our drinks were empty for most of our meal. One person would get ask for a drink and before anyone could say anything to her about other drinks she turned away and disappeared.  Literally we were never asked if we wanted a refill, we had to ask ourselves.  Having been a server myself I feel like waiting tables 101 is to ask if everyone else is ok before walking away.        Overall the dining experience tonight will forever put this place off my radar for food or drinks. Hopefully they get their POS system fixed as well cause the charge is to a place called WU's which I didn't eat at."}
{"text":"Went on a weekend afternoon and immediately notice a solid round up of drinks and food. The bacon cheeseburger is worth every penny of the $11 (includes choice of side). Also worth noting that their Bloody Mary was above average (why do so many people mess that drin  Note:They have added a back patio with some artificial grass and an outdoor beer cart for warm summer weekends i.e. you have a little better view of the alley rather than south blvd."}
{"text":"Great experience! My boyfriend and I went here on a Friday (\"honky tonk day\"). I got a chicken kale salad and it was delicious. My boyfriend got the chilli cheeseburger and loved it. Drinks were also great. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick lunch on a Monday out of curiously for the new trendy restaurant.  Our wait staff so super nice and food came out quickly.  However the food quality was so disappointing.  My coworker's Bacon Blue Cheese Wedge barely had any bacon on it and the iceberg wedge was frozen. We had high hope of their waffle fries but it certainly did not meet our expectations.    I ordered Buffalo Chicken Salad and not only it did not have any mixed greens as it described on the menu their the chicken tasted like frozen chicken tenders. Overall it was very disappointment trip wasted."}
{"text":"Shhhhh....I'll tell you a secret! Get here early! I've read the other reviews and quite frankly I think they just showed up at the wrong time! My husband and I got here around 4:30pm. There was a small crowd but we were seated right away! I always love to sit outside, especially on gorgeous days like today.  Honestly I came here for The Soccer Mom Special aka the adult Capri Suns! I got the Peach ring and it was so yummy! My husband went old school with the 2 dollar PBRs. I ordered the sweet chili wings (crispy with lots of meat and hardly any fat) and my husband got the pan of chicken nachos. It was a huge serving!  I also ordered The Boots with the Furrr, a honeysuckle vodka, cucumber, lemon and lime drink, it was pretty good too! The prices aren't bad and our waitress was amazing! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The highlight of Rosemont was that adult Capri Sun. It was super packed and they quoted us an hour and a half wait (I suggest making reservations on the weekend) so we just went straight to the bar.  Since we'd already eaten before, I can't comment on the food but the music was trash (I didn't know any of the songs and none of them were urban - I listen to a ton of genres so that says a lot) and the music was extremely loud (hard to hold a conversation).  Lastly, they market it like it's a bar, but it's more so a restaurant since it was hard to find somewhere to stand/chill. I'd go back to try the food and some of their other drinks but on a non-busy night."}
{"text":"If you're on the fence about trying Rosemont out, do yourself a favor and stay home.   By far the worst combination of food and overall restaurant experience in South End.  The food was cold, devoid of flavor and overpriced. The 'philly' that I ordered was $16 for two halves of medium sized sandwich role. It also was missing the cheese.   The atmosphere is a blend between a bad country music festival and a trashy dive bar.  On the plus side, it's close walking distance to dozens of other much better restaurants."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing and creative cocktails. Live music almost every day of the week and is always fun and lively!  Awesome place to hangout for an after work drink, or to party on the weekends... not to mention the awesome drink specials offered every day of the week!  Love it!"}
{"text":"My gps didn't quite get me to the right place so I had to take a little walk lol. But this place is a little past the Wells Fargo and has its own parking lot. I went on a Friday night and it was busy. They told us a 1.5 hour wait for 3 people.  To be honest, I was here for the drinks so we maneuvered around to the bar trying to get someone's attention. A group of girls had the adult Capri suns I came for and they vouched that they were delicious. The peach one has whiskey and the grape or \"transfusion\" has vodka.   I'm not a whiskey person so I got the grape and it was pretty good. Tastes just like juice. THE PEACH ONE IS AMAZING. At only $6 this is a steal. The pouch is so cool and perfect for navigating a crowd with ease and no spillage. That's really all you need to know tbh but I'll give you a little more.  The atmosphere is chill. They've got some TVs, the nba finals was on. They played s variety of music throughout the night, Carrie Underwood, Cardi B etc. The food comes out relatively quickly. The bacon cheeseburger was delicious.. the waffle fries were undercooked. The chicken sandwich was also good and the sweet potato fries were a hit. The giant milkshakes looked great and so did a salad I saw. The reception here is bad and the lighting is not ideal for selfies but I will DEFINITELY be back here."}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to check this place out. Overall it was great. I had the bbq chicken sandwich with waffle fries. Chicken was moist and good flavor. The hubs had a chicken sandwich and macaroni and cheese. He like the sandwich the macaroni was ehh. To me when I tried a bite I thought it had an unusual smoky flavor. He took advantage of the beer on tap special and I tried the peach Capri sun. I can't remember the actual name but it was delicious. Good pricing for what you get. Several people around us had the milkshakes and they looked really good as well. Will definitely be back to try one of them. The patio is pup friendly which is a bonus for us!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were super excited to try this place. Great concept, but I hate to say, EXTREMELY (with more emphasis than my phone can type) poor execution. In their defense, it's a new spot and we were there Friday night at 730, but the less than mediocre tasting food couldn't even salvage the terrible service we received. We were told there was an hour and a half wait for a table for 2 so we gladly sat at the bar thinking we'd have an appetizer and a few drinks then move to a table later but we never got a call (not even after we left), which is inexcusable in my opinion. We ordered the \"Fries, Fries, Fries\" appetizer with extra sauces to try, and the super basic basket of fries came an hour later with no extra sauces. We could barely get someone's attention to order a drink despite being at the bar so requesting our forgotten sauces was a lost cause, obviously. After 2 hours and many desperate attempts to keep our glasses full we decided to order food to go, which was a joke. It took another 45 minutes to get our food and the food itself was abysmal. We ordered the bacon cheeseburger with the mac and cheese and an extra side of pasta salad and it was barely edible. I had high hopes but unfortunately Rosemont just didn't deliver."}
{"text":"Drinks in a bag?! This place is so cool! We were in the area waiting for a dinner reservation. The wait time at Rosemont for a table was long so we hung out and enjoyed the delicious drinks while listening to live music."}
{"text":"I loveeee this place. The prices are good and they have awesome drink specials! Would also recommend the Mac n cheese it's only like 3$ and you get a good portion. The Capri sun style mixed drinks are also amazing (get the peach flavor)! New favorite spot in CLT."}
{"text":"I'm giving the Rosemont a 3 for a few reasons.   As far as the food goes, I'd give it a 5 - the fries,fries,fries appetizer was incredibly tasty & it came with 3 different dipping sauces. The crinkle fries tasted delicious. We also ordered the spicy buffalo chicken dip, which was good - nothing crazy.   As far as the service goes, I'd give it a 1. We went at about 3:00 on a Saturday afternoon - it wasn't very busy at all. We could visibly see open tables, but the hostess took over 10 minutes to seat 3 groups of people. It was the most bizarre experience I've ever experienced...it seemed like the hostess was on another planet when you'd ask her a question. Once seated we sat for 10 minutes without a server coming to greet us. I had to go back to the hostess and ask her who our server was.   The atmosphere was OKAY. It looks very clubby. For the evening and nighttime, I think the dim lighting and red lights would be fine, but for 3:00pm in the afternoon, it was so dark and so emo feeling. The atmosphere doesn't quite match the fun/soda shop menu.   I'd love to see something make it in this location, and hope that Rosemont can step up their service and atmosphere to match their fun menu!"}
{"text":"Such a great vibe. Came to watch the basket ball game with friends, and it was a great experience! Drinks were delicious"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Burgers and Turkey/bacon sandwich are hands down, the best! I'm a sauce and French fry fanatic and the selection for dipping is unreal. The adult milkshakes, alcoholic pouch drinks and cheerwine slushees are great and although I did like Wu's, Rosemont's quickly become my staple for client lunches."}
{"text":"Rosemont has it all, from soccer mom specials, (aka adult capri-suns) spiked milkshakes, and smashburger style cheeseburgers, live music, etc, etc etc. Its a perfect addition for southend! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night less than a month after opening so we knew it would be packed. We waited 20 min at the bar for a drink while our table was getting ready. We got the drinks and went to the patio and chilled for another 15 and then someone called us over saying our table was ready (we were supposed to get a text alert). 10 min after being seated the text alert came through. We ordered some more drinks, the waitress didn't know what a Highball was so we had to explain it to her. She brought back a whiskey and ginger (wrong), but my bf took it. She brought a vodka tonic when I ordered a vodka soda. We ordered food and the waitress didn't write it down. Someone came up to me 15 min after and said they were out of the fried cauliflower for my salad. Then the waitress who took our order came over and said \"you guys didn't order food, did you?\" And I said \"uh, yeah...someone just came and told me you're out of the cauliflower.\" And she said \"oh, okay!\" Lol so we get the food and it's alright...bfs fries came 5 min late and my salad (which was supposed to be kale but was definitely arugula) had a dairy dressing when I said hold the feta bc I'm lactose intolerant. I took 6 lactaid pills bc I was starving and needed to eat! The waitress came back and scooped up my lactaid pill wrappers after I finished and said \"I didn't even know we had these!\" Lolol so...we prob won't come back. The signature cocktails were good so I'll give it a star."}
{"text":"Sorry \"y'all\" (which I don't say, but will say for the sake of the south), but I miss Wu's. Many won't agree, and that's ok. I loved it :(. That being said, it was very busy here tonight, 45 min wait. The environment was nice and they played good music. The server was super friendly and I really liked her a lot. She took the order quickly and it and come pretty fast too.  I ordered the Rosemont burger. It was good, it had two patties, but I could've just done one. I got the chili on the side and they forgot my onions, but overall delicious flavor. Not a fan of the chili. The waffle fries weren't that great either, very hard!  The turkey sandwich was overly salty...but it wasn't mine, so that's ok. Mac & cheese is a no. Just didn't have a good taste.   Great staff!! I will come back to try the nachos and milkshakes. They definitely have better prices than Wu's......but I miss my friend."}
{"text":"A group of us went to the Rosemont on the first night of its opening. We showed up at 5 so had a table inside (thankfully since it rained). In my experience with new restaurants in Charlotte, they usually struggle with the first night. . .not Rosemont. They nailed it. We had an incredible waitress, Lexi. She was very attentive, checked in on us at the right times, made sure our drinks were never empty - awesome service! The food was really good too. We had the fries and shrimp snack - so good - and then I had the salad with Mahi. The atmosphere of the restaurant was really neat and the band was strong. My one and biggest complaint is the band was so loud we couldn't talk to each other. I would highly recommend the band start after dinner hours. We were literally screaming at each other. Look forward to enjoying this neighborhood joint more!"}
{"text":"Get the Big burger! They are not joking about it being big and it's only a dollar more. Big shout out to Bethany worked hard to help us out--fantastic place!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  I'm not a fan of bars, but I absolutely love Rosemont.  I went on a Saturday night around 9pm with 2 of my friends.  It took us 30 minutes to be seated which was understandable since they were packed.  The food was great!  I order medium wings and I loved them.  My friends ordered sweet potato fries, a side salad, and macaroni and cheese.  They absolutely loved their food as well.  The staff was very nice.  There were very sweet ladies that walked to each table to collect plates when the waitress was busy.  Our waitress, Morgan, was so sweet, helpful, and knowledgeable.  The drinks.... were simply AMAZING!  I ordered the peach drink that comes in a pouch similar to a capri sun and I loved it.  I ordered a total of three that night lol.  Parking was a little difficult but the bar is located in South End, the food and drinks are amazing, and they're usually busy so I wasn't surprised nor did I mind waiting.  I'll definitely be returning to Rosemont on a regular basis.  For those complaining about the wait time.. you can't blame the bar for having great food and a comfortable environment.  No one wants to leave! :)"}
{"text":"Loved this place!! Kat was an excellent server! Informative and sweet! Started with a delicious Frozemont-yum!! There were so many fun drink options- it was difficult to chose. We'll definitely be back to try some of the others:) the seasoned fries were perfectly crispy and hot. The nachos were covered with tons of cheese. The chicken sandwich was great! No complaints:)"}
{"text":"Gotta be honest here. Please please please get better bartenders. The bartender handed us the menu with no real greeting or introduction of the awesome drinks and cool features you have to offer. No smile. No excitement. How can i be excited when your staff isn't? The other bartender chatted up with people who worked for the company instead of the customers. I want bartenders who get it. We were prepared to blow money, but the service was so mediocre. I ordered the peel and eat shrimp which was over cooked. I asked for lemons which she grabbed with her hands...hands all over my lemons. Have you ever even handled food before? She seemed to not know much at all about anything, or at least didn't express it. I received no wet naps or anything to clean my hands. At this point in the game Charlotte has numerous bars/restaurants so work on standing out aside from a \"new concept\". It takes more than a new concept to make an impact. It's the team you hire. It seems like this is always an area of opportunity for this place."}
{"text":"Ah man, I really don't like doing this, but hopefully this review brings some positive change, because I'd really like to see this spot succeed.   Girlfriend and I went here Friday at around 9pm. Waited 20min for a table (no problem, very busy), waited about that whole time trying to get a drink at the bar (again, okay). We were told we'd be texted, but the cell service in this area is so bad the hostess (very nice) came to get us and seated us and then I got the text.  I ordered a highball to which our waitress asked \"what is it?\" and my girlfriend ordered a vodka soda, which resulted in a whiskey ginger and a vodka tonic.   The menu doesn't offer much - sandwiches, appetizers, and salads, all of the items being those you can find at any bar or pub anywhere. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich because it was the top sandwich in the menu and I figured \"I guess this is the thing they think is their best.\" No flavor, no heat, just a beige sphere of food that I vaguely remember eating. In comparison one day after work I very shamefully bought a KFC Nashville hot chicken sandwich which was probably 7 or 8 times better than this sandwich. My skinny fries also came out five minutes after my sandwich but these were actually good.   My girlfriend ordered the kale salad but asked for no feta as she can't have dairy. A different girl came back and said they were out of fried cauliflower for the salad to which my gf replied no problem, just no feta because I can't have any dairy. Our waitress then came back three minutes after taking our order and said \"you guys didn't order food did you?\" The salad she got was made with mixed greens (looked like mostly arugula), no kale, and a dairy-based dressing. She took some Lactaid pills and when our waitress went to clean up our table she said \"I didn't even know we had these\" (???).  Look, the place is busy, so it looks like they'll be fine, but it doesn't make much sense. They don't have enough space to be a party bar/club - even though a bunch of pastel button-down dudes yelled \"oooohhh!!!\" When the very loud DJ mix transitioned from Tearin' Up My Heart to Zedd's \"Why don't you just Malcolm in the Middle\" - but they don't have good enough food to be a food place worth anything in Charlotte. I didn't get their gimmick stuff that's supposed to set them apart (their Adult Capri Sun or alcoholic milkshakes, which, i don't know man, don't seem overwhelmingly appealing) so maybe I'm missing the point, but I rarely have bad meals in Charlotte, and this was probably the worst. If you want a positive, the well-drinks are $3 on Fridays, so"}
{"text":"I rarely give lower than 3 stars, but I had an interesting experience at Rosemont. I've been wanting to check this place out since I heard about the adult capri sun concept, so my boodle and I went on Friday after work to give it a try. We grabbed a parking spot in their small, tiny lot out front. SCORE!  We walked in where the hostess did not greet us. We said hello and asked if there were any tables outside. Her response was just, \"No.\" So I stood there wondering if there was a wait, if we could get on a list, I thought maybe she would offer to seat us inside... nothing. So we told her we'd grab a seat at the bar. She looked around and we walked away. Very bizarre.  We sat down at the bar. The space inside is really well decorated and very trendy. A bartender immediately greeted us and gave us menus. They were busy... pouches after pouches of beverages were flying out from behind the bar into the hands of thirsty customers. They have really cute, neon plastic curly straws. But this place is an environmental nightmare. I cannot imagine how much plastic they throw away daily.  We ordered a boozy milkshake and the bacon cheese fries appetizer. Fries were hot, cheesy, and delicious. Milkshake was yummy and boozy. No complaints on food or drink.  We did witness an interesting interaction between a customer and two of the bartenders. The customer ordered a milkshake and closed her tab. She had waiting about a minute or two for the shake, and then politely asked the bartender about it. The bartender said, \"It takes about 10 minutes to make a milkshake, but it's okay.\" The customer indicated that if she had known it would take 10 minutes to make a milkshake, she would have ordered a different drink. They went back and forth, the bartender being a pretty rude. Within 30-45 seconds, the milkshake was ready and the customer was on her way. The bartenders then proceeded to talk badly about the customer and I could hear every word. It was a little off-putting.   All this to say, I would like to go back to Rosemont. I think they were new and working out some kinks. I think the concept is cool, but I wish it was more environmentally friendly. I hope ongoing staff training and development will help them leave a more positive impression on patrons."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the amount of negative reviews, I had a good experience at Rosemont and would recommend it to anyone who was interested.  My only criticism is that I feel like Rosemont is having an identity crisis--the aesthetics of the interior are dark and moody, think black and red and neon lights...very cool. The music was loud country music for a large portion of the time we were there, confusing. The menu is all over the place with what the offer, not necessarily a bad thing.  Other than not fully understanding the \"vibe\" the food was really great. We had a group of 6 at lunch time, we were sat immediately and the service was friendly and attentive. Absolutely no complaints. We ordered a couple of salads, two burgers, a chicken sandwich and an order of sheet pan nachos. All of the food came out in a timely manner, and at the same time--which is always appreciated! The star was absolutely the nachos, they were awesome and the serving size is HUGE.  The skinny fries were shoestring perfectly salted and served hot, I love that they offer so many different sauces for dipping etc. I'm a big fan of condiments so this was fun for me.   This is worth checking out--I'd love to go back and try one of their signature items like the adult capri sun, or the birthday milkshake (alcoholic!)."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to checking out this new restaurant, but sadly I was let down. I ordered food and was told I could no longer accept it because the kitchen \"didn't feel like\" but I could order a sandwich instead. For a new business, in particular, it should be imperative to please the customer. Even if the kitchen had already stated their closing producers I ordered before closing time and I shouldn't be punished for someone trying to skip out early in their job."}
{"text":"Not bad but the menu really isn't anything special. It features burgers, common bar snacks like nachos and deep fried pickles, and specialty shakes for dessert. Nothing really made poorly, but all of this can be found done better at many restaurants all over Charlotte. Trying to be an upscale version of the late, lamented Penguin may not be the best idea. Then again, maybe this area needs something basic and average. Not sure. But any menu as unimaginative as this is going to suffer as long as the gas station across the street has better food. It did when Wu's was there and it still does now. My advice? Eat at the gas station."}
