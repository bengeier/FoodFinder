{"text":"Must say I am very disappointed with your establishment.  Last night, Sunday, May 10th, we placed a delivery order and were told we would have to wait an hour plus pay a $5.00 premium.  We agreed to both conditions.  15 minutes prior to order arriving, you called to say our food could not be delivered as you were too busy due to Mother's Day.  Too bad you waited 15 minutes before food arrived to tell us and then did not even offer us a promotion to make up the terrible service.  I expected better service from such a good establishment."}
{"text":"Nous sommes fan des soupes Tum Yum et Tum Kha à ce restaurant. Les plats du menu sont très raffinés.  Un des meilleurs resto Thai de Montréal... Le service est bien, l'espace sympa.  Les prix très raisonnables, notamment le menu pour emporter."}
{"text":"On Wednesday August 14 2013 was my first time in this restaurant we were there to celebrate a friend's birthday. The service was excellent and with a smile, the atmosphere was very nice and relaxing. But the best was the food. I had the curried chicken and steamed rice also a plate of vegetables this was so tasty didn't need any salt or pepper it was one of the best curried chicken I've had, and the wonton soup the taste was excellent not like at the buffet restaurants it had a real good taste.  I would recommend this restaurant to anybody and yes I will be going back there again. I won't hesitate for a moment to bring somebody there. And they deliver."}
{"text":"Pretty new place in Dorval very very very happy authentic, clean and delicious!!!!! I couldn't be happier I don't have to drive downtown to have some good Asian food! Truly impressed and trust me I'm very picky"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Would definitely recommend and go again Came from Ontario to have dinner with my family and we chose the right place"}
{"text":"They can't handle pressure!  I called to place an order for a pick up but they told me to call after five minutes because they're very busy.  Once I called back no one picked up and the call went to voicemail...mmm...Not Good!"}
{"text":"Understaffed and poor food quality. Had a reservation for dinner for 4 on a busy weekend. Got there at 6:30 and it was 8 pm before we got the main courses. Hot and sour soup was Luke warm and tasteless, same with the Tom yum. Main course portions were fair, taste was disappointing. I had the green curry with chicken, very thin green broth, like water. Also not spicy. In expensive and you get what you pay for. It seemed like the takeout business was prioritized over the restaurant service."}
{"text":"Emeraude de Bangkok (Emerald of Bangkok) shows itself to be a Thai restaurant, but in fact, everyone working there speaks Mandarin, including the owner.  The menu reflects this reality, as the Western menu is primarily Chinese cuisine with a shorter list of Thai offerings.   Still, the Pad Thai was pretty good, and the Chinese dishes were what you would expect from a resto that attempts to differentiate itself from the ordinary. They actually do something interesting with Spinach leaves, frying them lightly until crisp and adding a sweet coating, so that the leaf seems to melt in my mouth.  Novel and a first for me.   Overall, the restaurant is no gem, but it is a solid alternative for a town very different than Toronto and Vancouver - seemingly lacking a strong Chinese presence and all the cultural benefit that implies."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you are looking for Thai food. I was misled by the name of the restaurant. Curry was watery and translucent, and when I was ordering the server did not know how to make the dish hotter. Might be good for Chinese but I won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"Damn good. Order the green or the red curry. The Sesame chicken was a hit and so was the Szechwan beef. Solid pick."}
{"text":"A ma deuxième visite je confirme ce que j'avais constaté la première fois. Excellent. Tout est frais, chaud et abondant. Le service encore une fois chaleureux et efficace. Je peux même dire que les aliments avait plus de goût cette fois. Amélioration de ce qui était déjà excellent ? Peut être."}
{"text":"Food was great! I was looking for a place I could easily eat at close to the airport (I'm vegan) and this place popped up! Happy to see it was pretty busy on a Thursday night and it was across from my old school (QAA)! I never knew this place was in that strip mall! Service was slow and I questioned how much they understood what vegan was (I swear the vegetable soup had chicken broth) but they made me a delicious coconut milk curry and amazing rice dish!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very thankful to have this fine asian restaurant in the neighbourhood. Byob. General tao is one of the best in town"}
{"text":"I'd say the best tasting item here were the fortune cookies. LOL  We started off with a wonton soup. It was THE worst wonton soup I've ever had. The broth was bland but the worst thing was the wonton themselves - too doughy and tasteless. Then came the shrimp imperial rolls. These were actually decent. Then we split a plate of basil fish. I'm not a fan of basil so I did not find these interesting whatsoever but my boyfriend did like these and wants to go back next time we're in Montreal.  I told him he's on his own on this one..."}
{"text":"Just needed to grab a quick bite. The food was in fact excellent. Definitely a strongly Chinese leaning menu but the attention to fresh, flavorful ingredients makes this a win in my book. Not fast, but the rice in my fried rice was freshly prepared and the ingredients were cooked optimally. I will happily visit again."}
{"text":"I am a regular and their lunch menu is fantastic! It's BYOB and there's a dépanneur right next to it. I would vouch their lunch menu over dinner menu. Love their pepper Szechuan shrimp/chicken!! Comes with crispy spinach and a spring roll. It's my favourite."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant  Faut réservé si vous voulait une place après 18h vendredi samedi et même dimanche aussi   Très bon services  La soupe wonton trop bonne  Poulet sauce au arachide 10/10 trop bon je prend toujours ça  Poulet général tao délicieux  Ravioli sauce arachide debile"}
