{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Tuesday night with friends and we all enjoyed it so much! We had reservations so we were promptly seated at our table. We ordered the pita pillow for our appetizer and it was magnificent! Couldn't get enough of it so we ordered another.  It was quite the interactive appetizer! I ordered the bone-in ribeye for my entree and it did not disappoint. The portion was huge! It was seasoned well and cooked perfectly! Our waiter was very attentive to our needs and did a wonderful job serving us. We didn't get a tour of the basement vault, lounge area, due to the fact that it's only open Fri-Sun. Will have to go back just to experience that.  Since the restaurant is in The 9, the only bathrooms were the two unisex, private bathrooms in the lobby area. There were a few people waiting in line since only one person can use it at a time."}
{"text":"We came to Adega for the first time on 8/4/17 for our 17 year wedding anniversary- Brian was our server. Couldn't be more pleased. He was very attentive and friendly. We will definitely be back! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Upscale, kids in t-shirts and jeans and call this place upscale. Snobby attitude to stand on a rooftop with a bunch of 20-30 year old who look like they came out of a back alley. Classy, definitely not here"}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday for happy hour. Service was S-L-O-W The server was polite, but we easily waited an hour for appetizers that we thought were half price for happy hour, but they are not! Nor are their \"Signature\" drinks. A friend had been there previously on the weekend and said the service was great, so maybe it was a bad night, but I doubt that I will be making the trek back there."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Metropolitan at 9 hotel for the weekend and decided to give Adega a try for dinner. The decor is stunning with the open kitchen floor plan, it adds a another level to your dinning experience. The waitress was very helpful in explaining the menu and with the touchscreen IPad you are able to view exactly what you are ordering on the IPad. We started the meal with the polenta mozzarella appetizer. My wife ordered the seabass and I had the bone in ribeye, we shared the roasted Brussel sprouts. All of the food was cooked to perfection. With tip the bill was just short of $170.00, The next time I am in Cleveland I will putting Adega on my list of places visit again"}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for the bottomless brunch special and had the most amazing time!! Management and the chefs went above and beyond to make sure the food and whole experience was great. They really have five star customer service from the hostess in the front to the back of the kitchen. The bottomless brunch special is such a great deal you really get your money's worth of mimosa's/bloody's!! They keep pouring them and they're not skimping on the alcohol. All the food was amazing and huge portions! Everyone should go here for the bottomless brunch."}
{"text":"Everything was phenomenal. Service, staff, food, drinks and atmosphere! Chef Tom was the greatest!!"}
{"text":"Over-priced average tasting food.  My husband I ordered 1 drink each, the hummus appetizer, he ordered the NY strip and I ordered the chicken Francaise (which was oddly soggy).  Total bill was $124.  In comparison to similar priced restaurants, it was below average.  I was so excited to try this place out, but was seriously disappointed with the food.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and it was quite entertaining to sit and watch everyone coming and going in the valet parking area....  But that's about it."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to drink, eat and relax! Bartenders are friendly and know how to make the right drink for you! Happy hour is on point with a comfortable crowd and reasonable prices! Sunday brunch is really where it's at, interesting Bloody Mary pitchers and delicious menu items! Vibe varies by day and night but I love that! Would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch on a Thursday. No one in there at the time so it was nice and quiet. Turkey burger was delicious and the way the tea is served is pretty neat. Very neat atmosphere and service was good."}
{"text":"Three of us enjoyed a birthday celebration Sunday after a dance concert at the Ohio Theater. Each of our dinners were  flawlessly prepared and the staff was outstanding. Kudos to our skilled and delightful waitperson Michael G."}
{"text":"came here for brunch on a saturday. their adega flatbread was served hot and crispy. i got a side of pancake, it is VERY delicious. it was a big portion too.  coffee was expensive"}
{"text":"Awesome menu and food selections!   Will be back often!   Has great setting, and location.  Have no doubt this will be one of Cleveland's finest!"}
{"text":"My teen daughter and her two friends wanted to try Adega. They were dressed really nice. They ordered 3 flat breads and drinks. The bill came to 60.00 and they tipped the waiter $15.00. They said, the food was ok. The service was average. The restaurant served everyone else bread and butter, but not them. Why would they do that? Is bread only served when you order an appetizer and main course?  These girls have eaten in fine dining and have traveled to NYC & Chicago to eat in fine dining establishments. They tipped 20%. This restaurant did not leave a very good impression and so they left to eat dessert at the Chocolate bar. Lots of competition to win repeat customers. This one is not a repeat."}
{"text":"Great views, and a pricey but super solid cocktail program.  Had heard spotty things about service but had a great experience, and our server was fantastic. Well done!"}
{"text":"Great food but over priced. When you order a steak, that is just what you get, a steak. This is not a complete dinner, does not come with a potato or a vegetable or even a dinner roll! The appetizers we tried we the better value for the money."}
{"text":"Waiting for dinner after a Cavs and Indians game. We waited approximately 20 minutes and received water and nothing else. A waiter didn't ask us for drink or our order!! Management did not even seem concerned when we notified them we were leaving. Service was horrible hope the food is better."}
{"text":"Had a bottomless brunch. The food, drink and service was great! Thank you Lane for the great service."}
{"text":"Sara behind the bar is awesome! Great service and allot of fun to talk too."}
{"text":"Delicious food and neat ambiance. Good for group dining. The Brussels sprouts were finely done with a honey glaze. Paella was very favorable and certainly serves more than 2. One of my a favorite spots in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time with Mitchell for brunch today!! We were celebrating and he and Melissa really went above and beyond to ensure we had a good time! Had the Adega omelet with great success, was delicious, would recommend it! Will definitely be a return costumer for bottomless brunch!"}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time I have ever asked a restaurant to cancel my order so I could walk out. I had such a disappointing time tonight at Adega, I was actually disgusted by how poorly my party was treated. First, to be fair, our party of 3 arrived at 7pm, 1hr before Game 7 of the NBA Finals. We thought we would grab a drink and a bite to eat at a place we had been before and liked, and soak up some of the atmosphere on E.9th street. We should have know that nothing was going to go right, when we were told that we were the last people being allowed in to the near empty restaurant. Besides maybe a dozen or so people at the bar, there were only 2 tables of people seated inside, so there wasn't exactly a crowd. We were warned that it would take 15 minutes to get a drink, but it ended up being over 45. So fine, we were told we could only order beer or wine as the bar was overwhelmed, but after asking for 3 Angry Orchard ciders, the server's response was to mock our drink choice. We should have just left then, but instead this was the beginning of the truly deplorable service we were subjected to. I've never had to sit there and be belittled by an \"overwhelmed\" waiter. To be told that the restaurant was being closed so \"outsiders\" wouldn't come in and that they didn't want the undesirable crowd of \"people from the street\". Excuse me? We had come in after walking down the street from another bar. What exactly is the wait staff trying to say? And then to openly mock my sister for asking for her salad to come without tomatoes. And to be told that Adega is a \"Mediterranean restaurant and if you don't like these ingredients you shouldn't eat here.\" Not to mention the fact that when I mentioned that I have Celiac's, the waiter asked me \"do you really have a gluten allergy?\" Yes, really, but thank you for implying that I'm a liar. To add insult to injury to be told that people with a gluten allergy are a pain in the ass to deal with. Wow. Thank you for making us feel welcome. For a waiter to tell me point blank that \"I better not see a poor review on Yelp tonight\" amongst other comments was extremely unprofessional. But the straw that broke the camels back was when we were told that they would rather we didn't watch the game, which they had on the Tv in the bar area. Adega came very close to ruining what was going to be a memorable night. So after tracking down a manager, we cancelled our food and paid in cash for our 3 ciders. Good riddance. If you want good food or good service, go elsewhere. We certainly had a much better time once we switched venues."}
{"text":"Service was subpar. I wish I could have painted a smile an the bar staff's face. We ordered a vodka tonic and they served a vodka and soda. If you are looking for a good drink in Cleveland, don't stop here."}
{"text":"Food was delish! We had pork medallions and brussel sprouts and everything was great."}
{"text":"My wife and I had brunch at Adega after staying at the hotel and absolutely loved our meal and experience. The restaurant is beautiful and elegant, yet, very cozy. Our waiter (Matt R.) went out of his way to make us feel comfortable and we could tell he had a genuine enthusiasm for both the hotel, and Cleveland.   As for the food. My wife chose banana foster's pancakes and I wish I could share a picture of what they looked like. She only finished about 1/4 of her plate. I went the more traditional route of eggs, bacon, potatoes, which were also good. They didn't have a \"wow\" factor, but I would never expect eggs, bacon, and toast to make me say, \"wow.\" The bacon was great, though.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone. If brunch was this good, I can only imagine how awesome dinner would be."}
{"text":"$42 bucks for very subpar breakfast which was basically bacon and eggs  We stayed at the hotel and had a voucher for $20 off so we decided to eat here. We both ordered the farm fresh eggs breakfast and coffee. Our eggs were cold, the potatoes were dry and tasteless and the bacon was cut so thick that when chewed it had the consistency of rubber.   Do yourself a favor and go somewhere (anywhere) else"}
{"text":"We had a complete meal.  However this review is only for what I had to eat. As an appetizer I had the greek salad. It was delicious and this is coming from someone who is greek. As a main course I had the 8oz. Filet prepared medium well. It was tasty and cooked to perfection. It was as good or better than if it came from a well known steak house. For dessert, we had a chocolate hazelnut confection. I'm not one to eat desserts but I thoroughly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland for a week. Ate at different places each day. By far this Hotel 9 and their Adega restaurant was superb. Food  and atmosphere gorgeous. My waiter, Mitchell, made my solo evening so refreshing. Had the spinach mushroom ravioli.  Very good."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and decor.  Decent menu but disappointing overall.   Went for brunch with the gf.  Brunch menu is a little uninspired.  Not much variety though some ambitious items.  I had bacon and eggs which were (almost) exactly that.  They did add some fingerling potatoes to the 2 pieces of bacon and 2 eggs that ran me $13.  I had to order my toast separately for an extra few bucks.  Quality was fine but I think I've paid $4 for that exact same meal (including toast).  My gf had the Nutella \"stuffed\" pancakes which consisted of 2 pancakes with a couple of streaks of Nutella between a stack of two pancakes and some sliced banana on the top layer.  I think I made this exact dish for my mom As breakfast-in-bed on Mother's Day when I was 5 years old.   This dish was surprisingly amateur for the $12.    Coffee cups are small be refills few and far-between, bloody Mary's are uninspired and expensive.  Overall - I'd give it 2 stars as my meal was fine, just overpriced for no good reason.  Service was nice, though undertrained.  Lots of better places for brunch in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I was here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon and it was absolutely the best brunch I've been to in Cleveland, and I've been to a lot brunches. Christopher was my server and he was the most amazing sever I've had. Extremely attentive and tended to my tables needs on point. Jesse H made my shrimp and chorizo flatbread and it was delicious! I highly recommend it. Brian is he manager came by my ask about my experience which was a great change of pace from many of the restaurants I've been to. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I am really impressed.  I wasn't sure when I was looking at the menu. But with the suggestions from Melissa I was very pleased. I had the Serrano Ham and Fig salad which was delicious. Then I had the Italian Sausage Papparde. This was a very large portion and filed me up. I'm very happy.  I will be back when in the area."}
{"text":"Overpriced and the food was \"meh\" - - the descriptions were over the top and felt very gourmet - but the final product was simply not that great. Appetizers were basically deep fried mozerella cubes (though you wouldn't know that from the over the top description).  Pork belly app was mediocre - salty - nothing outstanding (it was on a bed of potatoes that tasted good).  Main course - scallops for my husband and sea bass for me - predictable (good - but predictable).  Nothing gourmet about it (despite the prices).  Dessert was such a major letdown - apple doughnut which had very little taste (like brouwn sugar and cinnamon on a plain dougnut hole) and dipping sauces that were brown and cream and that's about the only way you could distinguish between the two.  And I found the heavy ipad \"menu\" to be - well - heavy - - klunky - - and you had a paper menu as well so why the duplication?  We fully decided to go elsewhere for our next meal.  I mean, the food was \"fine\" so I don't want to give it 1 star, but when it's so overpriced, you feel like you really got screwed."}
{"text":"Adega is located in the Metropolitan at the 9 hotel. Since we were staying at the hotel, we thought we better give it a try...we were not disappointed! The atmosphere was romantic, yet trendy. The food was just wonderful! Our appetizer came out so quickly, followed by our dinners- I don't know how they do it, but there was such a mix of tastes in each plate that complimented each other perfectly! In my plate- the Chicken Francaise, there was a mix of sweet and bitter from the Brussel sprouts and the sauce on the Brussel sprouts along with a savory taste from the chicken and the spices mixed in- it was simply incredible! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Adega with some coworkers.      Their dining room is elegantly decorated, with a modern motif. It is definitely upscale enough that I would never hesitate to bring any type of client, or business contact here. However, parking is pretty much limited to using the expensive valet service, unless you park in a parking garage and walk a block or two.    The chairs at the hightop table that we sat at were heavy and somewhat awkward to slide in and out from under the table across the thick carpet. I actually think most of us commented on what a pain in the neck it was to slide into the table.  The service was polite, but little bit slow, and seemed slightly disconnected.    I had the chicken pesto pita with the sweet potato fries, As did my five other coworkers.  I believe that they all enjoyed this sandwich.  I enjoyed it too, but felt it was slightly overpriced at $14. However, I would definitely order it again based on taste, food quality, and presentation.  I also had the Greek salad, but did not care for it. It was average at best, and I do not feel like the dressing, nor the herbs used really complemented the ingredients in the salad as well as it could have.    Overall, I can't say that I was disgusted with anything here, but I will was also not really wowed by anything either. The decor is beautiful, but there is nothing else that I experienced that I am really longing to experience again. If a friend asked me to go there for lunch with them, I definitely would not refuse, but Adega definitely would not be my first choice for downtown dining.    I think that if they could refine some things with the service staff, it would positively impact customer experience, and I would be willing to rate them more highly.  Since they are still a fairly new establishment, it's possible they may actively be working to make adjustments. I may make a second visit in a few months, and update this review based on that experience.  There are seemingly a lot of great components present at Adega to create an amazing dining experience, but the execution just wasn't there (yet) for me."}
{"text":"Great view, great service, great cocktails. I love everything about this place! The bartenders were really friendly and helpful with finding me a drink I like. The girl even made up a cocktail on the spot for me."}
{"text":"Only because Adega is relatively new did it not lose another star.  C'mon, Cleveland, aren't we a bit more sophisticated than to fall in love with every trendy new place that opens?  To be greeted with, \"You need to leave your table by nine\" (p.m.) when we had seven o'clock reservations is just bush league, especially with plenty of open tables at seven and at nine.  On the plus side, the service was superior and waiter equally so; wish I could give that rank to the food.    Our paella for two was expensive and puny.  Our dining friends said the same. I've tasted better paella in cafeterias.  The wine was OK. Everything else was just \"meh\".  We will not return."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and a great outdoor patio.  Loved the brussell sprouts and the dips to start for dinner.  Go here before going out at the 9.  But the best food here is for brunch."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and service.  It's always a joy to eat at Adega. The staff is courteous, attentive  and prompt .  I would definitely recommend Adega to my  friends and family . I will return to eat as a,regular."}
{"text":"The layout is really nice and relaxing!!! The service was very slow too the point I had to cancel my food order!! However I visit the place the first week in the opening so that was understandable!! The servers were very nice!!  Will recommend I see a lot of potential and summer fun in this place!!! Great for Met 9 residents!! Easy access!!"}
{"text":"I would give 1.5 stars if I could.   This is just a glitzy interior with very mediocre overpriced food. Signature pork entree was appetizer sized for like $40. The $30 Iberico ham was bland and a small portion - it was only enough ham for maybe 8 crackers. I would forgive it if it was good but it really was very mediocore.  As you can see I really only use Yelp for mediocrity and sets a new standard for ripoff mediocrity."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for New Years Eve. They offered a special menu for the occasion at $99/person and you were able to pick from several choices for each course. Everything was delicious!! The staff was pleasant."}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant a two because even though we waited 25 minutes for a server to attend to us and after 15 minutes of being seated by the hostess after having to ask another server for a drink menu the server was actually very pleasant and polite. I  don't think I enjoyed any thing I ordered on the menu in particular. The olive oil spiced octopus just felt lacking it was very fishy and just not what I expected. My Serrano ham and fig salad was just salty, I don't find it appealing to taste the grains of salt on my salad, and the ham was just sorta plopped like a huge pile that I had to set it all aside to actually find the baby spinach. I then had the Chilean sea bass in a tomato type broth, and it just was not worth $39, it was okay at best and I am convinced that my white fish was some sort of cod and NOT sea bass. Sea bass is usually thick, tender and flakey, this was about the thinnest slice of \"sea bass\" I have ever seen with minimal flake and no succulence, customer beware! Otherwise the atmosphere had a nice urban sorta decor."}
{"text":"We have a great experience every time we go. Our waitress was courteous and continuously checked with us for our drink orders.   Even when we have opted for bar service the bartender answered our questions about drink options and was friendly as well as attentive. The atmosphere is engaging and it's easy to mingle with others.The rooftop views are spectacular."}
{"text":"Food was less than average....BLAND AND NOTHING FANCY.  The prices were BEYOND HIGH for what you get.  My husband actually left hungry after a $30/plate entree and his choice was their chefs special!  Cleveland has way too many excellent restaurants to waste your time and money on this one! Will never go back."}
{"text":"Overall SERVICE HERE IS HORRIBLE!!!!  Food way over priced .....we had a group of 20 and we all were unhappy with everything.... Never will come back here!!!!.  Never ever again.  The manager didn't even come over to recognize us.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"There is no doubt that Cleveland is on the move and growing into a city full of wonderful places to go.  However,\" the nickel and dime you\" mentality needs to be examined.  After spending $400.00 on dinner and drinks at The 9 Metropolitan Hotel restaurant-Adega , we were charged $18.00 for parking!  So between my husband and I leaving work and coming down in separate cars, we spent 36.00 dollars just to park.  No discount, no validation,  no courtesy.  I doubt that this is the case anywhere else other than Cleveland.  The Marriot should be ashamed to market this hotel/restaurant as a premiere venue.  The Autograph Collection brand is nothing more than a name in Cleveland.  The valet parking for this brand hotel in Vegas is complimentary if you are having dinner in one of the restaurants.  There was a parking lot right next door to the hotel that was charging 10.00 to park!   Catch up with other large cities that have fabulous venues and  offer ALL the amenities patrons spending money on a week night deserve!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited about this place. It has so much potential but like a lot of places in downtown Cleveland, the administration ruins everything. Sunday wad their first Sunday Funday... there was nobody there and they had nothing from the menu...like they didn't prepare for it at all.  Lastly, besides not having anything available to eat and not sure if they had enough ingredients for their drinks during their first Sunday \"party\"... they published the event as \"beach casual look\". However, the hosts were all wearing Sathurday night club type dresses (early afternoon on Sunday!!) which was totally ridiculous. They also looked at us weird because we were wearing shorts... eehh... beach casual? They totally failed on planing in so many different ways.  If you want to stay upscale you may have to deliver on the simple things first. I hope they get better over time but I see this as another \"Tomo Sushi\" type situation. Great concept and poor execution."}
{"text":"Stayed at the 9 for work travel and had a few meals at Adega. The service was stupendous, ask for William, the bomb server! And the food, WOW!  The brussel sprouts though, a must have!"}
{"text":"Food was great, excellent service and chef Eddie peace is phenomenal steaks were cooked to perfection and he even checked on them To see if they were cooked right!! Grade A service!!!"}
{"text":"I was at the Metropolitan at 9 for a conference. The restaurant is right off the lobby and a great view of the street. Lunch time on Tuesday did not seem like it was crowded. Hostess at the entrance was on the phone with another customer, yet amazing to see how warmly she welcomed me. They got me a great table with a view. menu items for lunch were reasonably priced. I ordered the Herb + Citrus Shrimp and it was a fantastic and filling meal. The service was fantastic that I had to ask the person who was serving me if he was the owner. :)  If in Cleveland i would go back anytime."}
{"text":"Michael.  Great service, your own personal sommelier. He obviously loves food and wine. We enjoyed his company as well as his expertise and recommendations!  I have to complain that the portions were too large. Other than that no complaints. If I lived in the area, I could have take home 2 days' worth of leftovers. Too bad I was in town for a short time.  I love the Iberian flare of the menu. I highly recommend going for the more Spanish dishes (although I did not try the steaks, to be fair). I am biased (having grown up in Spain).   Try: Charred Octopus. It's a one-two punch with the patatas bravas and chive coulis.   Fire Roasted Mushroom Flatbread. I sometimes find that the mushroom pizzas and flatbreads are thin on flavor and heavy on bread. Not the case here. Plenty of flavor with the kiss of sweet corn and the mild bite of feta.   Arugula Salad. The first time was perfect, the second time it was a bit overdressed. But I love it nonetheless.  Caldeirada Do Mar. If you love seafood, look no more. Go for this. The Chorizo begs you to take another bite, to mix it with mussel and shrimp. The scallops were cooked *to perfection*. The sauce was a soup that rendered me incapable of stopping. More, please! And the gorgeous bread to sop up the juices. Heaven.  Now,   Secreto Iberico. We've all had Iberico. The acorn-fed cured pork product we can't live without. But have you tried the steak version? This acorn-fed pork-steak melts in your mouth. And you just want to hold it there and savor the moment.   Wine: Impressive and thorough wine list. Enough said. (But maybe I mention the sparkling Rosé because every day after May is Rosé Day, right?)  Breakfast.  I am not a fan of the coffee. I'm used to single origin pourovers, so whatever they were serving was about 10x strong as I could handle. The generous server watered it down for me but it still tasted burnt. I do appreciate his efforts.  I had to order the same thing both mornings:  Adega Frittata jamón serrano, asparagus, honey ale onions, tomato manchego  While I feel the portions are outsized, the meals were all delicious.  Being from SoCal, I'm pretty spoiled and I must say this makes Cleveland a place I'd return to!   Thank you William and crew for a memorable business trip!"}
{"text":"Please stop playing loud rock music in this restaurant that is trying to have a posh, Manhattan type vibe.  I like rock but it does not fit at all with what it seems like your trying to do here ... and it is so loud for a restaurant like this.  The food is great, the service is great, the atmosphere cool BUT the music makes you look bush league.  Go to Manhattan restaurants and listen to the music. I split time living in CLE and NYC and would love to give 5 stars and would love to recommend this restaurant to friends and colleagues.  Will try it again soon."}
{"text":"I do like the Happy Hours here at Adega. I wanted to try Adega since I like to try everywhere at least once that I pass by often. two friends and I were seated as we had just gotten done eating elsewhere and we wanted to get some wine. The server was fantastic. I did not catch his name to memory so I shall describe him. He was taller with a wave of blonde hair, Male, and wore two colognes which one was a Dolci and the other may have been a Channel? I know that because my lady friend had to ask. I got a Merlot and it was quite nice and my two friends are new to wine so they got the sparkling sugary one. Why me. Anyways I enjoyed my glass slowly but surely and then they wanted more but I was feeling full. I should have ordered another since he made a custom drink and they got it complimentary. Wish I got one, my life... Anyways, I got to taste it and it was beyond fantastic and we fell in love with the server and Adega for that service to some young adults were we felt that we would be looked down on. We wanted to order food but we decided it was time to leave due to a Cavs game about to start which would be rather congested to drive around. Overall very happy. Very nice bathrooms in the building too, not the best but very nice."}
{"text":"Matthew and Elaine make the most refreshing cocktails and always put on a great show!! Best bar in Cleveland!!"}
{"text":"Had reservations for a couple of weeks. Tried to order a cake for my husband's birthday (we were visiting family and are from out of town), for a week calls back and forth. Incompetent manager (which is a mild review), called, would have a conversation-first the catering manager would call me back (never happened), then the manager would call me back (didn't happen), then what was it I wanted again, then manager wasn't there, then he would send an email with options (didn't happen). Place is unorganized as hell. Food...meh. Octopus rubbery, apps overall less than expected, pork was bone dry, tenderloin was passable but flavorless. And then there was the cake. After that much back and forth I would have expected a cake for the ages, an amazing, amazing bigly cake-but NO! They purchased a cake from the store in the building (my cousin had purchased the exact same cake at the store prior which is how we knew). Pluses are the server (who was great!) and the location-oh and there's a polenta side dish we thought was ok and some Brussels sprouts-a bit too sweet but pretty good. I'll say this-we live in probably the best foodie city in the country, or at least on the east coast (DC)-so we are slightly spoiled. Unfortunately this level of overall service and food quality was mid range at best-certainly not worth the $1200 food tab for our table. Meh."}
{"text":"Fresh quality food, great service and great atmosphere.!! A must try and will def be back."}
{"text":"Great scene.  Met a friend for drinks and snacks on a weeknight at the bar.  Cool iPad - type menu that you make selections from.  We shared the pita pillow with assorted hummus and my friend got a side of polenta.  The hummus flavors were good yet extremely heavy-handed on garlic.  Next time I will order the ham and fig salad for sure.  It looked amazing.  Bar service was okay...could have been more attentive.  Nice place to meet for drinks and the food is good."}
{"text":"Classy upscale restaurant with nice decor. We went when they weren't very busy so the service was good. The didn't have a cocktail menu which I thought was strange but they had a decent selection of wines. The chorizo flatbread was good & the chicken francoise was well made with polenta & brussel sprouts. We shared both dishes- def large enough portions to share. Overall a good meal but pricey. Not sure if I'll make it back again."}
{"text":"Cool trendy roof top action reminds me of the standard in downtown LA. The 9 drink is tasty too. Worth the trip for visitors and locals alike!"}
{"text":"Very happy with my first meal here! Panzanella salad was great! Lots of flavors. Split the pork belly app with a friend and am already craving it again. Wild mushroom flatbread was decent. Wine is a little overpriced which is to be expected though. Great atmosphere, very pretty place. Service was okay."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant out for New Years Eve, they had a set menu like most restaurants on New Years Eve that was a 5 course meal including dessert options with a choices of meat or vegetarian dinners to pick from. I did make reservations ahead of time for 9:45 we were seated as soon as we arrived party of 4. The staff were great the waiter explained the menu and pairings for each dish. The pumpkin soup was so tasty loved the pomegranate garnishing with the pumpkin. The steak was cooked perfectly rare. Also the scallops were also cooked just right not chewy or overdone they were just right. The seating was great more than enough room for our guests and not right on top of other tables. It was a little cold inside but the front is mainly glass and it's winter in Ohio so bring a sweater. All and all it was a great meal very tasty and staff was attentive thru the entire meal. I would definitely recommend this spot in the 9.  Thank you for the great holiday service. Also they validated my valet parking ticket so that was great."}
{"text":"Okay guys. First things first, right off the bat, read the menu. Don't make this mistake. I hastily ordered the tuna under the impression it was a tuna melt. When in fact, it was a raw piece of tuna on a cold plate. Yum.   The atmosphere here sorta reminds me of being on the rooftop of a luxury apartment in downtown Cleveland. It's actually awesome. There's no joke, a shower, in case you need to cool off for a few minutes. I guess patrons from the hotel use the rooftop to sunbathe and the shower to unwind. I will bet you a moderately priced IPA that this feature has never been used.  It refreshing. The pool that I jumped in that is. Luckily I have a waterproof case so I can continue this review underwater. This place is sweet for lunch, happy hour, meetings, dinner, music shows, etc. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour. We left satisfied, but not overwhelmed. Service was slow to start. One person (of two) arrived first and we both had to wait a few minutes for service once approached, bartender was very friendly. After drinks were placed, infrequent check-ins. She did apologize for the delay, but it was haphazard.  Final call was that they charged us a $6 upcharge because we ordered martinis. So, instead of a normal charge for a nice cocktail, my friend and I  left confused as to why we were charged extra. She was great with her wine recommendations, but we left not feeling the need to come back."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch on Sunday. I was very impressed with the brunch cocktail selections,  we got an item from the Bloody Mary bar which included deep fried crab, along with a mimosa.  Bonus points for presentation however the drinks are a little on the pricey side.  Good portions were decent and service was outstanding.  Next time I come back I will try the s'mores waffle."}
{"text":"1st time here and the food was good! The real treat was our server, Melissa. She was AWESOME! She was very knowledgeable about the menu, and was very personable. I don't think we would have had the same experience without her. The veal and fig salad were delicious, but everything else was so so (muscles, asparagus) but who likes asparagus anyway? My girlfriend actually made me get it. I'm in sales and everything I do revolves around creating a great experience for my clients. Melissa did just that. We will come back because of her."}
{"text":"The service is attentive. The decor attractive. But the menu is far too doused in polenta and paprika. The fingerling potatoes? Drenched in paprika. The aioli?Mixed with paprika. The appetizer? Fried polenta. The fish? Polenta crusted. It's worth a try. But be forewarned. The chef must shop at Costco."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go here again unless I'm staying at Metropolitan and outside weather doesn't permit me to try elsewhere. Price is on higher side and not the best food around. Much better places in downtown Cleveland than this one."}
{"text":"Went here for my boyfriends birthday because I've heard amazing things and the menu looked great. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint! Our waitress, Kat, was amazing with her pinot noir recommendation. We started with the charcuterie, which was spectacular then each had a salad. He went with the arugula salad and I had the beet and fennel one. Next time will have to try the Greek. For our entrees I had the sea bass. I'm not sure which was better, the corn purée or the perfectly cooked fish. My boyfriend had the handmade pasta with the Italian sausage that I had a few bites of and was also incredible. It was nice to have bigger, filling portions at such a high establishment. For dessert we had the doughnuts. My boyfriend is not usually a \"sweets\" person and even he couldn't stop raving about them. Ambiance and service were excellent as well. My only complaint is when I booked the reservation I noted that it was my boyfriends birthday and I wanted a surprise dessert brought out for him with \"Happy Birthday\" written on it and then additionally called a few days before the reservation to verify they were aware of my special request and was assured they had it covered.  However, nothing special was said or done during our meal for him. I did not bring it up while we were there because it was meant to be a surprise. Other than that larger detail being missed, it was spectacular.    Adega has since contacted me about forgetting the birthday dessert and were very courteous and apologetic. Cannot say enough great things about this restaurant. Will definitely be back and HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing .Love the food, drinks , service and decor! The views are stunning too. Love cleveland loveeee"}
{"text":"Went here for 4th of July Brunch (Saturday) and was pleasantly welcomed w/ Excellent service and a delicious meal. To start things off, I got a pomegranate mimosa and it was well rationed. My bf ordered an Irish coffee and was also decently spiked. I had The Adega and it was delish and filling. He ordered the Ciabatta Chorizo Gravy and while I'm not a fan of gravy; i tried it and the gravy was excellent.  The patio space is great!"}
{"text":"Lots of vegetarian options here. But the menu logo is wrong is several spots (a ham appetizer is labeled \"vegetarian\" but a veggie quinoa bowl is not?)   Unfortunately the food is disappointing. The Nutella pancakes were dry and too big for the plate. The eggs any style were boring. The Adega burger, I'm told, was a weird mix if flavors. And the service was very spotty: friendly but inattentive."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner for my wife's birthday. Great experience, service is top notch (Bret, our server was grear), food is great. We had Tomato Bisque and Foie Gras for appetizer and Rainbow Trout for main course and Brussel Sprouts as side dish. Fish was expertly prepared and Brussel Sprouts were delicious.  When we mentioned it was her birthday, they gave us complimentary dessert, which was a great touch. (FYI - when we checked in on Yelp, while we were at the restaurant, a coupon giving us 50% off our first appetizer popped up, another great touch!). Also, make sure u asked them to validate ur valet parking, I believe we got $5 off or something like that. Overall, great and enjoyable experience"}
{"text":"We showed up around 10pm on a Saturday night and sat at the bar to eat.  We were warmly greeted by Joanne who single handedly made this a five star experience.  She recommended the Brussels and the Polenta.  Both were better than ever imagined.  My wife does not like Brussel Sprouts and ate more than I wanted her to:)  I thought Polenta was similar to Tofu, you just can't make it taste good.  I could not have been more wrong.  Everything we had was amazing, but only because Joanne guided us so well."}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  Both times were a great experience, and the second time inspired me to write a review.    My girlfriend and I made reservations.  We showed up a little late, and the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  We never waited any time at all before someone would ask if we needed anything.  The food was the best part.  I ordered the Adega sandwich with Parmesan fries, and she got the Adega burger.  We had the strawberry and nutella crepe for dessert.  Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing.  I can say the Adega sandwich is one of the best tasting things I have had in a long time.    We were there around brunch time, so the prices weren't too bad.  About $40 for two meals and dessert.  In general, a little expensive, but if you consider the environment, the quality of the food, and the service, it was well worth it.      When they returned my check, they even called me by my name from my card, which was nice."}
{"text":"I pass the 9 all the time, so i decided to try their brunch one day. It is located in the 9 Hotel. The place is nice inside, really fancy, gives a romantic ambience. We were given our menu in a physical form as well as on an ipad, a freaking IPAD lol.  The prices were WAY to high for my usual commitment to food costs, and honestly the food didnt wow me, but i guess they have to pay for the cost of those \"ipad\" menu's lol. The service here was ABSOLUTELY horrible, we waited an hour for seating, then another hour and a half for food, the waiter alone took 25 minutes to bring out our drinks. This put me in a bad mood for the rest of my meal.  I had a smothered s'mores waffle, the name alone gave me a cavity. It was drenched in marshmallow, so unfortunately that was all i tasted. it was way too sweet for me, and a waffle that cost me $10 i should be able to enjoy all the flavorings.  My husband tried the adega omelet (tomato, serrano, bacon, arugula etc) which took a good 40 minutes to come out, and it was cold, and you could tell it was probably sitting waiting to come out for a while.   While the omelet was good, the principle of us waiting forever for it make it seem less desirable. Im a brunch lover, but this place certainty did not live up to the expectation i had in mind after reading others reviews. My next trip i plan to make a reservation, hopefully that will curve the idiotic wait time, but thats even if there IS a next time.   Save your money folks!"}
{"text":"I was caught by surprise by Adega.  Looking for brunch, we were making our way to the Playhouse when we saw this place.   First of all, Cleveland on a Sunday morning is super quiet, almost the point if you wonder if anyone lives there. It could have just been our area.  Walking along the street, we see Adega, and through the windows, we noticed how nice it looked. One of two things was possible: it was as good as it seemed, or it was a fancy brunch place that looked nice but in reality didn't serve anything.  It was cold, so we thought whatever let's just go for it. We sat down, looked at the menu's, and did not expect 1) the portion size 2) the quality.  Everything was on point. From the coffee to the potatoes, eggs, and arugula.  Absolutely loved it, and recommend to anyone looking for a nice brunch."}
{"text":"I had a romantic dinner here for my birthday with another couple and the atmosphere was just beautiful. The food was spot on and the waitress was always around refilling our drinks and wine glasses. The 4 of us felt pampered the whole time. I was also surprised with Apple Fritter Doughnuts and a candle - nice touch :) They were delicious!! We are looking forward to going back again. Best part was the after party on the roof!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to visit this restaurant when I heard it opened. Anyways, my fiancé and I finally got a chance to go here. It def looks very nice as i heard and does have a touch of romantic side to it yet classy and cool. Even tho the restaurant was kinda empty, with so many empty tables, it took us 10 mins or more to get seated. . With reservations being made.. The hostesses aren't that good and the one was really weird. Like slow...even though she saw we were standing there waiting for a long time. Our waitress was friendly and was fast. We got the cheese platter which the cheese was good, but the bread was stale. I could barely bite into it. My fiancé paid $16 for 4 medium pieces of shrimp with smeared cocktail sauce. We won't be back.. But I give it 3 stars for its looks."}
{"text":"I have been here for both brunch and dinner. The experience was superb on both occasions. The food is picturesque and the menu offers many truly unique, flavorful dishes that embodies the high quality feel that is expected of the 9.  I, being the 'stick to what I know' patron, ordered the Chicken Francaise and was not disappointed. The addition of the polenta and brussel sprouts is unexpected but is really to die for.  I haven't had too many of the cocktails here but the wine list is diverse, so every palette is safe. If looking for a high class feel with a friendly environment, my recommendation goes to Adega."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try Adega for brunch after seeing Nutella stuffed banana pancakes on the menu but sadly, I was disappointed.  First, the service was good and the waiter was nice. But if you asked him what he recommended he basically listed off the entire menu (which for brunch is not very large). I ordered the nutella stuffed banana pancakes. I am not sure what part of this meal was \"stuffed\" as all I had was a drizzle of nutella on top of the pancakes. I will say the bananas were good but did not salvage the meal as a whole.   Despite having seating available and quick service on a Sunday for brunch, I would not recommend Adega."}
{"text":"I desperately need to update my review since the last one. After speaking with multiple managers from the previous horrifying experience, they sent us a gift card to come back and give it another shot. The gift card was supposed to have been for the original amount spend $140.)   We went on a Friday night again and the crowd was totally different. I don't know if it was the chillier weather, or what but it was a more tasteful and clothed group (not Jersey Shore like before.) Prior to doing anything, my husband gave our server the gift card and asked him to confirm how much was on it. Well, he came back and there was only $25!!! This was a huge slap in the face after all the trouble we went through to get it and we were so irritated. My husband took the issue right to the manager, who had remember speaking with him and was VERY helpful and accommodating to make sure to do right by us and he took care of our meal up to $150.   I don't know what we would have done if that particular manager, Jacob, wasn't there and hadn't remembered the whole disaster in the first place. It was refreshing to see such impeccable customer service and we were basically treated like royalty for the rest of the night. Not sure who dropped the ball giving us a mere $25  thinking that was going to appease us, but they need to be fired.   The 2nd time around, the whole experience was 100% better. Our server was polite, professional and attentive and the food was outstanding. I especially loved the pita pillow for an appy and we both got the filet as an entree.   Job well done for proving you are not what I thought you were, Adega! And special thanks for Jacob for allowing everything to go smoothly and an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Love love this place  We are here the day before I delivered our daughter for our Valentines dinner date. We had reservations and granted it was a snowstorm and I am sure People had canceled, we had on spot service ! We arrived and our table was ready for us right away. We ordered the pita puff appetizer and it was amazing. My husband had the steak and I had the salmon. Both dishes were delicious.  My husband got to talking to the manager and the manager offered to give him a tour of the event space since my husband holds a lot of meetings. The place is amazing.  Every time my water was empty the were right there to fill it up. They cleared our empty plates and soon as we finished.  We ended the night there by ordering a dessert. Well also ordered a bottle of Caymus Cabernet and the service was very knowledgable about the wines !  To end the night we ordered dessert and was delicious which may have been what out me into labor the next day !"}
{"text":"Aside from the beautiful setting, lighting, and decor. The food was tasty, light, hearty and very flavorful The Salmon was perfectly cooked over a bed of fresh cooked quinoa ...I was ready for another serving but wanted to make room for desert....The Manhattan is a not to miss!  The service was impeccable, so were the recommendations by our kind waiter. The talented chef Eddie Tancredi was kind enough to come see us at our table so we were able to thank him in person for the exquisite meal. We are going back very soon! Adega upped the Cleveland food scene"}
{"text":"Adega offers a great alternative to the norm in fine dining.  They seem to specialize in perfectly prepared \"healthy\" carb dishes. We had the polenta, quinoa,  and Cous Cous dishes to round out our chicken and salmon. Each was spectacular in its own unique way. The roasted veggies and pita puff were also great. You won't be sorry you tried this place :)"}
{"text":"Adega is located at the lobby level of The Metropolitan at the 9 hotel on the corner of 9th and Prospect. The 9 itself is an architectural treasure, and once inside, the floor to ceiling windows at the lobby and in the restaurant fame the city very well. At the center of the restaurant is this massive glass tower of a wine cellar which I though was a nice Modern touch.  The food isn't classic Mediterranean, I'd still say New American with a hint of Mediterranean. I normally hate Brussel sprouts, but those ones I loved. The trout, flatbread toasts, creamy polenta side dish, and the Chicken Francaise were all good eats. The service, atmosphere and quality of the food was top-notch that day."}
{"text":"I do apologize that this review is very long, but after much consideration and a few unannounced visits, I must share my honest opinion about dining with Adega at The 9.  This restaurant deserves a very strong 4 stars and here's why:  *Executive Chef Eddie Tancredi's menu *Hospitality *Decor *Ryan Galati--management  *Brian--server *Cocktails--they are both works of art and absolutely delicious; you will literally want to drink each and every one!  Here's the unabridged review: To keep things terse, my initial visit was not stellar. I made a point to notify the restaurant and I was immediately contacted by management. Because of the nature and sensitivity of my concerns, several members of the Adega team, very graciously and warmly, reached out to me to correct the matter. The most flattering contact was Executive Chef Eddie Tancredi. The mastermind behind the menu & instructor in the kitchen, contacted me directly and offered me and my Fiancé an exclusive re-visit to the restaurant, as his personal guests.   When the arrangements were finally made, we returned with hopes to truly experience Adega at its finest; we were not disappointed!!! We were treated like royalty as Eddie created a 5 course meal especially for us. The true beauty of the experience was not knowing what was going to arrive to the table because Eddie was creating each course from scratch/from the depths of his culinary genius. Even before dinner began we were given a warm welcome from Eddie Tancredi himself! He came over to our table and engaged us in wonderful conversation and inquired about our dietary restrictions, before disappearing to work his magic!   On a side note, those unfamiliar with Eddie Tancredi, must to do their research---consider him just as skilled and accomplished at Michael Symon & Jack Bruell, without the constant over-referencing and restaurant monopoly in Cleveland. To get to the heart of it, he is truly talented without all the unnecessary hype. Obviously, I am not a food connoisseur, but in my 30years, I have never experienced a more poised presentation or a better preparation of seafood! Furthermore, after speaking at length with our server Brian, I discovered that Eddie was the only hand-picked chef from Cleveland, to be recognized internationally and alongside the ranks of countless accomplished restaurants in Japan, Dubi, even Vegas. As I mentioned before, he's the real deal, and I would be remised if I didn't beg anyone to give Adega a fair try just to experience one of his menus.   When you visit I would also urge you to ask upon Brian as your server and look to Ryan Galati for any of your dining needs or concerns! Ryan, as management, is a true class act. He is hospitably charming and has one fierce walk/strut--I say this with love because to watch him in action, is a thing of beauty. Brian will always give you an honest opinion & outstanding service; he's experienced in the \"industry\" and will not give you that \"stand-at-attention\" unreachable/zombified/artificial waiter act. He's a cool guy and because Eddie changes the menu a few times throughout the year, he will actually explain the menu items in excellent detail. I promise you won't be dissatisfied!   I wish to close this review by saying that although I am well aware that my re-visit was designed to impress, Adega truly is a wonderful restaurant!! Even though the staff was gracious enough to extend their best hospitality, I must admit, I have returned a few more times, unannounced, just to see how the service truly is/without the glamour of intentionally impressing an unhappy patron. Their hospitality still held! I always order seafood; each time it was cooked to perfection and as I mentioned above, their cocktail list is out-of-this-world amazing--literally anything off the cocktail list, will dazzle you! I conclude by saying that Adega certainly knows we're its \"light\" is! They have definitely become one of my top 5 in Cleveland. The next time you're in the mood to be wowed in Cleveland, make a reservation! If you're unsure, start by asking for any of the accomplished gentlemen mentioned above; you're truly in for a treat!"}
{"text":"This restaurant truly deserves the 5 stars. From the food to the service, my experience here was superior to most restaurants in the area. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Had Chilean sea bass which was prepared incredibly well and surprisingly fast. Very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The absolute BEST SERVICE!!!!! Lane is awesome, definitely request him! We had a big group for St Patrick's day brunch and had the corned beef poutine special which was to die for. our server Lane took exceptional care of us. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing spot for brunch! Food was phenomenal. I go the burger and it was perfectly cooked with an amazing pesto aoli and feta! Yumm!! Got 5 mimosas and a meal for $28!!! I will be coming back again, and again for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner worth the wife before a show, food and service were both amazing. Started off with the Greek salad which was good. I had the iberico pork entree which is a must. The wife had the mozzarella toast also very good with a variety of flavors. The honey Brussels as a side dish were probably he bet Brussels side I have had anywhere. Lastly, for desert we tried the donuts which were good but the dipping sauces were limited to a butterscotch and jam, a caramel or chocolate would have been nice."}
{"text":"I had a really good experience here.  I ate here for lunch and tried the salmon dish.  The taste was excellent, service was great, but it was a bit expensive for lunch.  It would definitely have five stars if not for the price.  I definitely recommend if you are looking for an infrequent lunch spot, or a place to take a client."}
{"text":"Normally I try to avoid writing reviews for new restaurants, especially after only one visit. But Adega left such a great impression, I think I can make an exception.   The 9 complex is gorgeous. For you non-locals out there, this particular building was an outdated, rather homely, high-rise right smack in the middle of Downtown Cleveland. No doubt a reminder of the slow decline of CLE's past. Not anymore! The exterior of the complex now screams upscale, chic city-nightlife, especially with it's flashy video signage (a la micro-mini-Times Square). Inside it has the same fancy decor, trendy-chic updates to draw not only locals, but travelers alike. Trust me... we have more than enough character-filled hole-in-the-walls and artisan cocktail bars. Some flashy, big-city upgrades are what Downtown Cleveland needs. Plus, this whole project actually saved historic buildings.  Now for the dining experience!   Service - I found our server to be sugary-sweet nice, but a little on the shaky side. He was really helpful with the drink menu, although he had to take a look when I asked him sparkling wine suggestions (by the glass.) Again--these are new servers in a new restaurant. This is to be somewhat expected Otherwise he was great with the menu and seemed so happy to be there, which is a major plus on my list.  - He did forget to put in our order for an extra pita pillow, which isn't a game-changer, but isn't great either. - When our food was ready, it came out in the hands of about 3 different servers, which I appreciated because it meant they wanted all four of us to get our hot food at the same time. However, not one of them knew who was getting which dish and my pasta almost slid off the plate because the server set it down without much care.   Food:  - We ordered the hummus trio shared plate with the pita pillows. It was delicious! I loved how the pita pillow came out puffed-up--stabbing it with a fork was almost too much fun. Just one criticism though... While the menu says, \"Pita Pillows\" you actually get just a single pita. It's honestly not enough for 3 people--the dish should just come with two without the extra charge. There is no pre-dinner bread served here, and how expensive is a pita? - I tried the Trancredi Sunday Sauce, which I heard was orgasmic. It was delicious, but not mind-blowing good. I wish I had just tried the dish without hearing about it first. It came with a sauce containing huge hunks of pulled pork, which sounds great, right? It was... it just needed more punch--there wasn't quite enough salt or spice. My dining guests ordered the Chicken Francaise with Parmesan polenta. Oh-my-god. This dish is where it's at. You don't really expect memorable chicken dishes from a restaurant, but this one was all kinds of perfect: Tender chicken, creamy-salty-cheesy polenta and Brussels sprouts.   Overall:  A memorable, fancy, fun and delicious experience--but not a cheap one, by any means. I was a little surprised by the prices, but I'm assuming they're targeting a business travel crowd and not so much happy hour-ing locals, if that makes sense. Either way, like I mentioned before, CLE has plenty of cheaper options with artisan, locally-sourced foods, microbrews and craft cocktails. This upscale downtown restaurant fits a different market, which is perfect for the new downtown CLE."}
{"text":"Terrible experience here.  Went to enjoy the downtown Cleveland skyline but the bar is pretentious and poorly managed.  We get it- it's an exclusive bottle service type place.    After being told the first night we arrived to move several times/ and then when the same thing happened the second night- we just ended up checking out of the hotel.    There are so many wonderful hotels and cocktail bars in Cleveland, it's not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Adega was a wonderful dining experience. A friend and I dined here for brunch recently for an intimate birthday meal. The service was first-rate. The food was delicious. The ambience is nice.  The hosts who welcomed us were very warm and accommodating. They smiled and wished me a happy birthday.  Our server, Brian was excellent. He was kind, patient with our finicky selves (so many delicious options), always kept our drinks topped off, but we never felt smothered. We'll be asking for him next time we come.  We both had coffee, which was very smooth, making it dangerously easy to drink. Our only complaint was the cups were too small.   I had the Croque-Madame and my friend had the Nutella Stuffed Pancakes. The Croque-Madame was perfect. It was open-faced with only one thick slice bread, which was good because it was a very rich dish. It has a truffled essence to it.  What made this dish really stand out, was the lightly dressed greens that gave it a nice acidity to balance the richness. Also, the two Friday eggs that topped the dish were perfect. The new Tele stuff for pancakes were gigantic. My friend and I could've shared these, but why when he can have the whole thing to himself? They were decadent, but still felt very childlike, which was very nice.  The restaurant itself is a beautiful space. I strongly recommend it for brunch, obviously, but also very special night out. We sat in a booth that faced the kitchen, but it still felt intimate. There were tables on the other side of the gigantic, beautiful wine cellar that face the street. I imagine those are nice on a warm weather day.  I highly recommend Adega to all those looking for a high quality dining experience, with delicious food, wonderful service and a beautiful atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is spot on!  Came here for lunch and ordered the Adega burger with Parmesan fries."}
{"text":"Was there Wednesday evening. Staff was professional, the facility was clean and well maintained. Food was more of a mixed bag, while all was artfully prepared, some dishes were far better than others. The chicken francaise was ok, but lacked flavor, as the sides surpassed it. On the other hand the sea bass was amazing; firm and flakey with a clean and light, yet bold flavor. Mediterranean salad appetizer was beautiful, but a but on the salty side. Bread was fresh, but a bit bland with a quality Olive oil to dip in, but was good with the salad a it cut the salt. Dessert was a chocolate hazelnut item, which was rich and wonderfully paired with fruit and sauce, but could have used a few more berries when plated as the pairing is wonderful.   Overall a great meal and dining experience, 3.5, but consistency of quality flavors across dishes could be worked on."}
{"text":"So far, this is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland without any exaggeration. The waiters are very professional and helpful. For an appetizer, I always get the ham every time I go to this place and it never disappoints me. Also their dishes are all amazing but I will upload a few pics of my favorite dishes tomorrow when I have time. Overall, the atmosphere is nice and I highly recommend this fancy restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not so good if you're vegan. The Greek salad was extremely salty. The chef said the pita with the humus had egg in it??? ( pita doesn't usually include egg in it). Our waiter was nice but the place was empty. Maybe a lunch place?  Modern Mediterranean means modern dishes, over salted and over seasoned... not impressed."}
{"text":"Our waiter Jay made our first time visit memorable! My boyfriend and I dined here for his birthday brunch and the service + food was amazing. Jay took great care of us and was helpful with selecting items for my boyfriend due to his allergies. I can't wait to come back here again!!!"}
{"text":"My friend said the music was bad here. Came to confirm. Music is bad. Tequila good though."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and I am not very impressed at all.. They say this is the best time to live in Cleveland and it still seems like a dump.   - drinks were $10-$12 range and not very inventive or creative  -beer menu is a joke. It's laughable   -did not eat but saw the food the bussed up the elevator. It did not look appealing at all. Standard bar food  -the views of abandoned buildings, rooftops,  etc. we're not appealing  - AstroTurf on the ground? New low. They laid it down unevenly too and places that had hard flooring were covered in spot gum.  I am pushing for the revitalization of Cleveland, but it seems like people just let new thing run down or don't give it 110% to make them great"}
{"text":"Bottomless Brunch is where it's at! All you can drink Bloody Mary's, Mimosas, and Miller Light plus an entree for $28! Service and food is delicious."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, the service, outstanding and the food delicious. The place is run by Chef Eddie Tancredi and it's clear as to why he earned the title of National Chef of the Year. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I took my friend here and I really wasn't happy at all.   First off if I am paying $36.00 for scallops ala carte I should get more than four.  My reservation was for 10:30pm and the entire time the waitress was rushing us because they close at 11:00pm. If someone is going out to dinner and spending that much it's because they want to have a good time not feel completely rushed.  I ordered prosecco and the waitress suggested a drink with prosecco in it. So we ordered one instead of two just in case we didn't like it. My friend was really liking the drink and the waitress came up, literally ripped the drink out of my friends hand, and says I knew you wouldn't like it. And brought her a glass of prosecco.  Look at my reviews and you will see I'm normally fair. I had a truly unhappy experience   I will not be returning to this place on my next trip to Cleveland."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Adega Sunday evening...myself, and three friends. The hostess was nice, she can stand to be a little more personable. Stop running your fingers through your hair dear heart! Not a good look for a person who works in a restaurant  (food, o.k.). Our server...Mitchell, Mitchell, Mitchell...if the food were not all that good...WE would come back for Mitchell! Mitchell gives the food industry two thumbs-up! Where can you find a more informative server! On top of that, this guy is exceptionally nice! And GOOD LOOKING!!! Any who,  I had the Gemelli w/shrimp  (which has chorizo, I don't eat pork so that wonderful Mitchell guy had the chef, substitute with beef) DELICIOUS!!! My friend was able to get a special order Pina Colada! Mitchell, you give people the \"want-to\" to come downtown and have dinner! This guy even took pictures with us! The valet staff, the front desk gentleman, super guys!!! One thing...get rid of the square shaped rubbery bushes in front-ugh!!!"}
{"text":"We had William as a waiter he was batting a thousand one hundred and 10% the food was fantastic the atmosphere was phenomenal and the wine was exceptional"}
{"text":"For all of the hype that The 9 received, I thought this place was going to be better.   We came here at 6pm on a Friday night, with reservation. It didn't seem to be too busy, then again, it felt like a big space so nothing was too crowded.   The ambiance of the restaurant is great. High ceilings, an impressive wine cellar, and high end decor definitely gives it the high-end feel of The 9. Unfortunately, the quality of the decor did not match that of the food.  We started off with the pita pillow and dips, which sounds and looks better than it tastes. The pita was oversalted and the 3 dips were nothing to write home about. The waitress brought out a polenta dish, complement of the chef...which looked like a glorified crouton and tasted like stale bread. Chris got the iberico pork, which he said he only semi-liked. He thought it would have been better if the slices were cut thicker. So far, not so good.  The one redeeming part of my meal was the chicken francaise with brussels and polenta. The flavors of the dish worked well together and I would order this again if I had to come back. But overall, the prices on the menu did not match the quality of the food. For this reason alone, I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I saw the decent reviews for Adega when I was searching for a restaurant  before an event at Playhouse Square.  We got there at 6:30 so we were able to enjoy the Happy Hour specials ($5 wine and beer) and then ordered a meal.  I had the greek salad and the chorizo flatbread.  Both were delicious.  My friend ordered the filet and the fingerling potatoes.  He said his food was delicious, as well.  The downer for the experience was the parking situation, or better yet, the lack of parking.  You can valet with the hotel, but even \"validated\" it cost $10. I figured since I was already paying for parking there, that I would leave my car there and walk over to PHS.  Nope, that $10 is only good for 3 hours.  So, I had to pay for parking twice."}
{"text":"Working in West Virginia live in Detroit and Cleveland is somewhere in the middle. Met the wife there for dinner Saturday night and it was absolutely perfect. I believe Joe to be our waiter and he was outstanding also. Very nice Saturday night!!"}
{"text":"It wasn't amazing, it didn't suck. Not dying to go back. The hotel is so lovely we wanted something brilliant and it just wasn't there."}
{"text":"Filet Mignon (peppercorn crusted - by request) with Arugula salad.  I forget the name of the other side but it was excellent!  The filet was outstanding!  Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Visited Adega. Not AT ALL hard to find. It's in the hotel. If you're staying in the hotel you literally come out of the elevator and its right around the corner. If you're not still walk in and its opposite the front desk. We visited Adega because I was planning on proposing. I spoke with Ashleigh before our visit and she helped me set up the whole thing. Our visit to Adega was great, our service was perfect. He helped us select a wine that we would like and was in our price range. If you're looking for a nice hotel to stay at for the night or just a nice night out I would suggest Adega. I have to stress this. Adega is FINE DINING,  Like a Flemings or Beaus grill."}
{"text":"Just went here for my anniversary last night. I hadn't been to Adega since the place opened. The first time I went it was superb and I was very excited to come back since it had been ages.  The place is just beautiful inside. I love the modern interior and the vibe. It is very chic, upscale, and just has a very swanky atmosphere. Absolutely love! We went on a Tuesday night and it was not too busy, but definitely a nice crowd for 9 PM when they close at 10 PM.  Our waitress Joanne was great. I had put on the reservation it was our anniversary and she greeted us with a congratulations and was a nice personal touch. She was very informative and had a wonderful personality.   We had some drinks before we ordered and just relaxed which was nice. I had a glass of Sauvignon Blanc from France and it was crisp and delicious.  I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and my boyfriend had the Iberico Pork. He was originally going to get a steak which we've had here before which is delicious but she suggested the pork saying it was very unique to Adega and a must try. Both of our entrees were delicious! I loved the sea bass. It was cooked to perfection and the corn puree with celery had a great citrus kind of taste to it and was perfect with the sea bass. My boyfriend's dish was awesome. The pork had such an amazing seasoning to it and it was just the perfect portion.  Our waitress surprised us with a dessert for our anniversary which was a beautiful rich chocolate mousse-like bar. It had a raspberry drizzle and it was delicious.   Overall this was another fantastic night! Five stars as usual. They stated that they are launching a new menu soon so I am excited to come back and try the new dishes!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place as we eat out often, but have never been here. The space itself is beautiful, and we had an attentive server. Of the 4 meals ordered, 3 had to be sent back. The strip steak was ordered rare and came out well done. The filet was ordered well done and came out rare. And the blackened snapper was RAW. Ewww. By the time the food was prepared again, we had to leave to catch a show. At least the manager was aware of and apologetic for how horrible our food was prepared, and wisely removed these items from the bill. Unlikely I will return."}
{"text":"Adega is indisputably attractive. With beautifully tall open ceilings, a transparent wine vault, and bold lighting fixtures, it's a true complement to the architecture of The 9.  As its attached to the hotel, Adega certainly attracts a diverse crowd. I hear people often say that Adega is \"too fancy\" for them, but truly, all are welcome. The food is excellent, and Chef Tancredi even serves up a special pasta dish from his childhood, aptly named Tancredi Sunday Sauce (pictured). It's a must try!  The serving staff are very friendly and professional. However, they don't have a physical drink menu, which is confusing. I was surprised when our server brought back an iPad with a confusing interface to navigate. Since I couldn't figure out how to search for wine by the glass (it defaults to the bottle), I stuck with just ordering a mimosa, since we weren't in the market for a $50+ bottle of wine. Like any popping downtown restaurant (especially because of its prime location!), I recommend making an early lunch visit at 11/11:30, or a late lunch visit around 12:45/1pm. Looking forward to visiting again, but this time, for dinner!"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our meal here.  The arugula salad was not that exciting, but everything else about the meal was very good. The dining room is very contemporary and very grand, and a nice oasis in the middle of downtown, not very far from Quicken loans Arena. They have a nice selection of wines by the glass, though they are all $12 or above, and our server was very good and very attentive. I enjoyed the Atlantic sea bass, which was cooked just right and came with a very tasty corn purée.  And my child, who is picky when it comes to steaks, thought his fillet mignon was excellent. It came with not a lot of side dishes, but the carrots were very interesting and cooked like potatoes. We also had the NY strip, which was very good. Definitely a good but pricey option in downtown Cleveland. Classy and food forward."}
{"text":"This restaurant is by far the nicest restaurant in downtown. We had brunch on a Sunday and the atmosphere was great,amazing food and Mimosa .Angi our server was very nice and hospitable.I really recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner experience, had the Caldeirada Do Mar seafood dish and it was excellent. Atmosphere was good for a weekday, not too loud. Service was very good and Chris checked in on us numerous times. Haven't tried the weekend brunch yet, but it's on my list. Definitely recommended it to friends."}
{"text":"A nice experience with some interesting food selections, but nothing out of this world (especially for the price). The hand-made pasta was very good yet fairly expensive for such a small portion. The three other people in our party had the same feeling. The atmosphere was nice and the large wine cellar in the middle was very cool. That being said, the prices at Adega don't match the quality. Good, not great food."}
{"text":"Unwelcoming, Unfriendly & Downright Rude Staff With Over Inflated Attitudes Serving Way Overpriced Cocktails.   ***** Attention Management *****  Teach your staff to smile and treat customers with warmth and respect  = Visited 5 times so far & encountered this same ethos.  = I've heard tons of these same complaints from my fellow downtown neighbors  Too bad"}
{"text":"I'm just so underwhelmed with my experience. I guess I took the Chef Tancredi  hype too serious, since I thought eating here would be a little more high class tasting. I mean, there were fancy schmany ingredients but nothing to make me go bananzas. Actually I did not care for probably half of the dishes. Flat bread was good but hey.... those aren't hard to make and I can think of a million other places to get a cheaper, drool worthy flat bread.   I'll probably end up back here since The 9 is a weekend fun spot, but not at my suggestion."}
{"text":"Such a delicious brunch. Sunday with Browns playing at home (we were there for Cowboys staying at the Metro on the 9) and we got seated immediately. Jay was our waiter - super nice and understood we were in a bit of a hurry for the game. I had the Ciabatta and Gravy - chorizo was perfect amount of spicy, bread was perfectly crispy around the edges and egg was cooked just the way I like it. So flavorful! The Parmesan waffle fries were absolutely the best I've ever had. Highly recommended for brunch!!!"}
{"text":"First of all - ask for Brian. Either in his role as shift manager or waiter - he is a great asset to this establishment. The food and drink is fantastic. Service is 5star all the way. Atmosphere is very relaxing and friendly. We made reservations through Open Table and received a call that morning to confirm. Appetizers were full of flavor, as was everything we ordered (flatbread (wild mushroom), trout, and pappardelle pasta). Fusion food with just the right amount of flavor. Great place - we will definitely be back next time we visit Cleveland!"}
{"text":"great looking inside...awesome atmosphere. service is attentive but not intrusive. each guest is given a menu and there is also a digital menu at the table to show you pics of what each plate will look like. it's a novelty, i HATE menus with pictures! a little to dennys for me.  salad special with smoked beets and goat cheese was good, but a little to \"yesterday\" creatvely. appetizer of a take on arancini with creamy polenta squares stuffed with cheese, breaded and fried was awesome. the crab \"cigars\" were just average. my strip steak was prepared as ordered, very rare, but the fried fingerling potatoes and fried kale sides were very over salted. fried kale as a vegetable side dish? really? it's a trader joes snack on a plate and called a \"side dish\"; not very good.  there is valet to park your car, but be prepared to wait in a LONG line and there really isn't parking that close by....so be aware that you may have to walk a bit if you choose to park your car yourself. i'd say this place is just GOOD.....a little pretentious, a bit over priced for what you get, a little to \"trying too hard to be cool\".  i don't know....check it out and make up your own mind. it's good, but there are other better places downtown."}
{"text":"I've had a few different experiences at Adega, and overall my favorite part about this restaurant is the atmosphere. The inside is beautiful, high end and not like many places in Cleveland. They have an extensive wine list... It actually takes you a good 5-10 minutes to get through it. It's also on a digital menu as well so easy to flip through. Where this restaurant loses it for me, is the food... I wouldn't say it's any better than a lot of my other favorites in the area, but I felt it was pretty over priced. I ordered their scallops and received 5, for $36. Yikes.... I'm still hungry. Good place for cocktails or a glass of wine, but I'll skip the dinner next time."}
{"text":"Just ok. Food was mediocre--had the flatbread mushroom dish and a very odd too wet Greek salad. Here on business and will be looking for somewhere else to eat. Service was incredibly slow as well."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews but I was so disapointed with Adega,  I will not go back there again.  The two hostess were not very friendly and clueless.  Didn't know how to treat the upscaled guest.  We spend over $900 and we had to wait for drinks.  For the money you are spending,the food isn't that Great.   I was Very Disappointed.  3 ppl order the same pork dish and it came out very different all 3 time.  We ordered desserts and they tasted like they were sitting on the counter all day.  No one came over to ask us about the service. The waiter seemed overwhelmed.  We wanted to add one more person and they told us they couldn't accommodate us.  We had to send one of our business partners away.  Now looking back, we should have took our business somewhere else.  That really pissed us off expecially since we waited there for over an hour for our table and there were empty tables available.  They could have sat us at two tables or give us other options. I know it's a new restaurant but they need a lot of work if they want to compete with great restaurants downtown. If you are looking for a great restaurant go to XO or Red before Adega.  It's a shame that the restaurant doesn't compare to the hotel and the Vault.  We had a great time at those places.  This is actually my 3rd time at Adega and the other time I was impressed either.  2 people sent their steaks back and they still didn't get it right. To top off the night, you would think spending $900 would get yout parking validated. Well,  It didn't.  Also, when they did bring our car, it was completely covered with snow and the valet attendent didn't even bother to clean the car off a little.  It's called common courtesy.  i hope they get it together !!!  So dissapointed!!!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, but the service was unacceptable. Took way too long to get our meals. Our server was obviously ignoring us as we awkwardly stared, wondering what was possibly taking so long, when the manager came over to tell us they accidentally gave our meals to the wrong table. This manager did nothing to rectify the situation. While the food was mostly good, (I didnt care for the dessert) will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Adega (a-d-E-ga) is located in the 9 complex.  The newest hotel in downtown Cleveland and I am pretty sure the fanciest (for now).  A friend was in town for business I suggested this place for dinner.   The ambiance is intimate, sexy and romantic all at the same time.  Great location for date night or if you want to impress that person you met on the dating app (Tinder, OK Cupid...etc).  Food:  The food cost a bit more than I would like but you have to splurge on occasion.  I highly recommend the butternut squash soup and the flatbreads (yum!)  Drink:  I had a chocolate inspired cocktail and my friend the wine enthusiast had red wine.  The cocktail was well crafted and the server was very knowledgeable about the wine selection.  Tip: If you check in on YELP you can get 50% off an appetizer.....so do it!"}
{"text":"We were attracted to this place because of the advertisement of the $28 bottomless brunch. We were limited to 5 meal options due to the bottomless brunch which we found choices we liked so that's fine however it's a very small menu aside from it. The \"bottomless brunch\" is a limit of 5 drinks and includes mimosas, blood Mary's and Miller light. Our food took a long time and we had pancakes and an egg over toast with 2 sides of bacon...mind you a \"side\" of bacon included 2 slices for $5. The server was in over his head and took a long time to come back for more drinks seeing as we're trying to get the most for our money. We had 3 rounds before we decided to get the check...and when I say 3 rounds I mean two of us got our 3rd round and he never came back with my friends 3rd mimosa. We had to move somewhere so two of us left to get the car while 1 person waited to pay the bill...she waited 10 minutes after we left for the server to bring the check and another 15 minutes until he came back with her card. The bottomless brunch wasn't worth the bad service. I wish we went to a local cafe to get a better breakfast and service."}
{"text":"Love the bottomless brunch! Very classy place. Discount valet parking with restaurant bill."}
{"text":"A+ atmosphere. Lighting soft & intimate but enough you can easily read a menu. Interactive screen menu well describes all items. \"Chefs offering\", I guess this is instead of bread, was twin planks of browned polenta with a relish. The \"9\" cocktail tasty but a bit sweet. I stuck with vodka and tonic which was generous & perfectly mixed. Substitutions or special requests not a problem. Two diners wanted a small dinner salad with their chicken Franceise which our server cheerfully suggested they split the Greek salad which she brought on two plates. The Francaise had two moderately thin slices of tasty tender chicken. Greek salad great taste but would prefer more lettuce and less chunky cucs. They'll serve it with chicken making it a meal.  Restaurant sits slightly lower than street. Super large windows look out on to 9th street providing a very cool view of the busy street. Feels very NY NY.   Don't miss this experience."}
{"text":"Didn't even get to try to eat here. I made reservations on OpenTable or 12/25/2016 at 8:30pm and later changed it to 8:45pm and received a confirmation email from them. I called them tonight letting them know that I'm running 5 mins late and the girl that answered the phone said they were about to close so I asked why would it let me make a reservation from 2 weeks ago, however, she hands me off to someone else who says there was a miscommunication but lemme see what I can do but offered no valid solution. I'm from out of town which was why I made reservations for them two weeks in advance. I'm not sure what solution they can offer if they claim they are closing. I'm sure someone checks the reservations set for the night and at some point in the day should have called to confirm if they know their Christmas hours do not accommodate a late reservation. Thanks for ruining our Christmas dinner"}
{"text":"atmosphere: very cool inside being in the ninth hotel. They also had a small outdoor seating area   Service: kind of hit and miss while we were there. There were a lot of long gaps in between the different touch points as well as multiple people serving us that seemed to not talk to each other  Price: on the pricey side especially for what it was.  Food: the handrolled pasta was good but it is hard to doubt that it was handmade pasta instead of store-bought. The Chilean sea bass was rather delicious and was a hearty size. Salmon special was very good  Drinks were OK nothing too awesome  Probably won't be back I'll try something else instead"}
{"text":"Went for lunch during restaurant week.  The food was good, but the service was slow.  I won't be back and pay their high prices.  Way better choices available in the area if you're paying Adega's prices."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went for our anniversary and we were treated like royalty. The food was excellent! We ordered the honeyed bacon brussel sprouts, lamb, and wolfish."}
{"text":"Staying at the 9 for the weekend, this is the most convenient place to dine.    We had dinner Saturday night and breakfast Sunday morning.     Two ordered steaks one ordered pasta with bolagnese  and one had the ham appetizer.     The waiter was new and struggled with our order from drinks to desserts.    He disappeared for extended periods of time and seemed overwhelmed though the restaraunt was half full and overly staffed  The food was adequate but expensive.  Breakfast...just avoid this place.    Staff are rude.   Host  asked if we had reservations...not one other person in the restaraunt.     When we left there was one other table seated.    Menu options are few.   Find a better option."}
{"text":"Adega is such a pretty restaurant in the 9.  I'm pretty impressed with the 9- it's glitzy and glamorous and is a nice place to go. Seeing there was a restaurant in the hotel, my girlfriends and I decided to take a trip to Adega.  We made reservations a day before and got a table for 3 at 6pm. Our waiter was super nice- loved him- super chatty, super knowledgable, and just super nice. The menus come on ipads, so it's nice- you can even see pictures of what's on the menu.  However, in terms of the food....meh. Not sure if I really enjoyed it as much as the ambience. - Drink- got \"the 9\" in honor of the name- pretty strong and not that flavorful - Food- got the chicken francaise on polenta- the polenta and brussel sprouts were good, but the dish wasn't astounding at all - My friend got the scallops. Wasn't impressed and kind of salty. - My other friend got the hand rolled ravioli. Eh. Not that great.  Overall, the food wasn't the greatest. I had high hopes for the restaurant, but we left feeling unimpressed. However, the hotel itself is beautiful and if you're looking for a place for just a drink and an appetizer, then I recommend Adega. However, for a solid meal....there's lot of other places around the area to go."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding. Our meal was great. Food was hot. Prices were very reasonable. Service was also the best!  Ask for Chris. He is a great waiter."}
{"text":"I went to Adega with a group of friends from across the country while we were all in town for a conference. The restaurant is located in a beautifully renovated office building and has great ambiance.  The food is +++. I ordered a glass of white wine, the fettucini ceci (sooooo good - would love to learn how to make this at home) and a chocolate nutella deliciousness for dessert. The pasta really was amazing. Pesto, small bits of orange, what tasted like homemade pasta, cherry tomatoes and chickpeas. Really really good.  What I didn't like: The service was super-slow to get underway. I think they thought we were waiting on one more person, but no one checked to be sure. What I really didn't like was that a few people at our table ordered apps for the table - which I had a bite of, because I didn't really want them. Yet our server, in an effort to be nice to travelers, put the two appetizers on the two lowest bills. WHAT?!?!?! So I paid for an app I didn't want and didn't order. Not cool and not so easy to say anything about it. And I wasn't on an expense report (the stated reason he split it up that way) - I was on per diem. I would have been ok if the total cost of the apps had been split among all of the dining guests.   Other than that (which obviously still rubs me the wrong way), it was an excellent dining experience and I recommend giving it a try.  BTW - the restaurant is tucked away inside the lobby of a boutique hotel which is inside a converted office building. It can be tough to find, but look for a GORGEOUS converted bank building (Heinman's) and it's right next door."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 10 last Saturday for brunch, and we all had a blast! If you are looking for brunch, you CANNOT beat the bottomless brunch at Adega. $28 for an entree and bottomless mimosas, bloody Mary's, or beer (and yes you can switch!). Our server was Andrea, and she was really great! The entire table had great things to say about her when we left. The food was average, nothing I would particularly go back for. I ordered a burger (medium) and it came out well done. The bottomless was a great deal, and service greatly exceeded expectations based off of other Yelp! reviews. If you're looking for a fun brunch, go to Adega and ask for Andrea!"}
{"text":"Had bottomless brunch. Food was fantastic and very filling! Best service I've had at a restaurant in a while. Lane was our server. He had a great personality and made sure that our drinks were always full and our table was always happy! Very accommodating!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch, I really enjoyed the appearance of the restaurant and they have a great brunch cocktail menu. The food was pretty good but came out somewhat warm - not hot. Service could have been much better since the atmosphere leads you to think your waiter will be very attentive. It's a fun place for brunch downtown, so I will be back. The CLE frittata and their breakfast potatoes were very good !"}
{"text":"Deplorable service.   Normally when I write reviews I'm as objective as possible when reviewing service and servers due to extenuating circumstances that may pop up. I hardly ever leave bad reviews or 1 stars because I really believe that if you have nothing nice to say to don't say anything.   Unfortunately my review starts and ends with the horrible service I received from the server.  I came with a small group of friends for a bite to eat before the game 7 of the NBA finals. Unfortunately from the moment we walked into the empty restaurant and informed by the manager that we would be the last people allowed in due to crowds I knew this was going to be a bad experience. We were also informed that drinks would take 15 minutes and food wasn't currently being served.  Drinks were never served to us in that time. We took a seat on the empty patio and waited 15 minutes before I walked into the bar to place an order instead. The bar area was filled with maybe 30 people and the bartender was barely able to keep up with the drink orders. I waited another 10 minutes before giving up and going outside to leave. However the rest of my party finally found a rude server to place our order. We then tried to move to a better seat in the completely empty patio to get a better view of the tv in the bar to watch the game tip off.  Long story short we waited another 20 minutes to get our drinks. We waited another 10 before we could place an order for food from the horribly rude and belligerent server who thought it was okay to belittle our order and mock my sister with celiac disease.  We ended up waiting another 10 minutes before we walked in, spoke with the manager to cancel our food and paid for our drinks in cash before we left.  Needless to say we won't ever be back."}
{"text":"Okay, so Adega wasn't easy to find but then I found it located inside the Metropolitan. And there it is.  Sunday brunch didn't appear to be all that special. They do have a Bloody Mary bar, but I'm one of those people who can't stand tomato juice. Supposedly, there's bottomless mimosas but I found no evidence of that. Sad face.  I opted for the veggie omelet with toast and home fries and a chicken apple sausage. A very large portion of food here and it was very tasty. The omelet was one of those folded sandwich things, which is okay. And the home fries were actually fingerling potatoes. Very nice. The sausage was tasty and sweet. Yum!  It's breakfast, so it's decent. And the location is pretty good for me, once I found it. I could see returning to Adega for a dinner."}
{"text":"Not sure why you would go here when there are sooo many better bars in town. The waitresses are lousy and the management is nonexistent.  Really? A cover charge? For an overcrowded patio were all the sections are reserved? After the first evening of being told SEVEN times to move somewhere else, the last thing I wanted to hear was that I had to get up and move.   I should have known better to return after sharing my frustrating experience with staff from another part on the hotel and having them laugh and agree how much they suck.  Don't waste your money or your time here. Don't stay at the hotel either.  It's an overpriced Marroitt after all."}
{"text":"Had dinner in the private room above the main dining room.  Very nice.  Service was good, but we needed two waitresses with 14 people as she had to go up and down steps to place our orders and bring up meals.  Therefore, service was slow, but she was doing the best she could.  Although we were charged twice the amount of a group gratuity (so check your bill), the manager agreed and corrected it, and was going to look into the error.  This venue is a busy place, and great for people watching.  The bar upstairs, Ledges, is intimate, quiet and nice."}
{"text":"I already wrote a review but I had another great experience. I went for Sunday brunch with a group of 5 and we all had amazing food and great service! Our waitress was so nice and friendly and she told us about the fruit juice of the day - watermelon and apple - which was so delicious! We got a complimentary parfait for the table because we sat near the kitchen and kept eyeing the fruit bowls!! It was so fresh and amazing. The turkey burger and quinoa bowl are great choices!"}
{"text":"Stick to the middle of the road fare, and you will be fine. My martini was just fine. The service was very good. My friend ordered the pasta with the pork shoulder-based sauce, and it was perfectly acceptable. Nice, comforting dish.  My mistake was to order the grilled octopus. I rarely have the instinct to send something back, but the first bite was so fishy and mushy that I nearly spat it out. The octopus had clearly been sitting around for a while. The rest of the plate was tasty, but it tasted more like something you'd pick up at the antipasti bar at Giant Eagle than what this place aspires to be.   If the tagline of your restaurant is \"Modern Mediterranean\", your grilled octopus should be on point, no?  In their defense, this place was only open for 3 weeks when we were there. It's on the ground floor of a building which claims to be the first to offer concierge living in Cleveland. In the immediate vicinity, it's a nice option. I wouldn't object to going there again, but I'd order a steak."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and the service was very good but the communication between the party planner and the staff was less than optimal. There was a miscommunication about the way the bills were to be paid and it held up the night by a good 35 min.  Ps. For the prices requested... Please ask the staff to wear black pants and not denim while serving. The look of the servers should match the quality of the kitchen staff and their cooking."}
{"text":"Menu is a hit or miss. Went here for dinner once (see review by my sister Lin H #LINvFOOD) and was not excited by any of the food we ordered. Recently went for lunch and found 2:3 of the meals to taste alright. The shrimp flat bread and Bloody Mary deal is the only up side. Would rather brunch elsewhere on any day."}
{"text":"I visited Adega on Thanksgiving with my family, and so I am going to review based on that meal. It is not a typical meal, since it was not their regular menu (special Thanksgiving menu instead), just to let everyone know.  My husband booked a reservation about a week ahead of time (once we realized that every other upscale restaurant in North East Ohio was already booked for Thanksgiving day... who knew people actually went OUT for dinner on that day?), and although I didn't know what Adega was, I was still excited to try somewhere new! I am so glad we did, too.  The restaurant is located in the beautiful Nine Hotel (or is it 9 Hotel? Sorry for mistakes). This would be perfect for a date night with your significant other -- the overall atmosphere and the glass wine cooler in the middle of the room are really neat looking! Our waiter was very friendly and able to answer any questions we had. I only wish he had taken the drink orders of those who were ready at the table (dining with my husband and in-laws, and not all of them were ready yet) since I was ready. Instead he got one person's order and then walked away when the next person said they weren't ready (and he didn't end up filling the first order he got, just came back later to take all of the orders). Oh well, I guess next time I will visit the bar first in case we have to wait 20 minutes at our reserved table for a drink. Our waiter also did not take the ladies orders first, which I always think is a polite thing to do, especially while out at a nice restaurant for a special occasion.  Other than those few details that didn't work out as well as they could have, the meal and the drinks were amazing! The turkey dinner was seriously fabulous. I never want to cook Thanksgiving dinner at home ever again, if I could go back to Adega each year on that day it would be fantastic. I had a mixed drink (Adega Sour, thanks to reviews on Yelp that I read ahead of time) and it was quite lovely. I also ordered the butternut squash soup - a must have! - and for dessert we all split the chocolate crunch dessert (sorry I am blanking on the name of it) and the mini doughnuts with raspberry sauce and cream sauce. I am looking forward to returning to Adega for a fancy occasion!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations because of all the hype of Adega. I was very disappointed.   Three of us went for brunch on a Saturday. An email from them said you got a Bloody Mary and entree for $25. A poster in the lobby stated you got an entree and two bloody Mary's for $25 and our server informed us the deal was an entree and two cocktails (either a Bloody Mary or mimosa) for $28. Confused?  I sure was.   I ordered a breakfast with chicken sausage that I couldn't eat because it was so heavily salted. Another at the table felt the same about the sausage as well, inedible for both of us. The eggs were scrambled perfectly so will give them that  There were two Bloody Mary options on the menu for the same price, but we were told the classic was the only one available with the special. Not sure why since both were same price.   I paid $28 for a mediocre meal. The confusing information added to the less than good experience. It left a bad taste in my mouth. I will not return."}
{"text":"I've been to Adega a couple times for dinner and once for breakfast and so far everything has been great! Among all the great food they have, i want to give a special shout out to their toast points because I was doing really well on paleo and then I go here and eat 3 of them throughout the meal.  Appetizer standouts: charred octopus & pork belly. I've gotten the greek and arugula salad and both times were 5/5.  The greens were super fresh and the dressing was perfect for each salad.  I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the salad (large!) given the cost to food ratio on much of the menu.  For an entree, the Caldeirada Do Mar is hard to pass up because that broth is so flavorful and you get multiple proteins in your meal instead of one!.    The Metropolitan is a high end hotel and this restaurants reflects the same kind of ambiance as the rest of the hotel.  I have come here dressed in street clothes and felt a little guilty."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate after the release of a friends book and the restaurant is beautiful! The staff was also very accommodating as our group showed up a little late for our reservation. Had a salad and can't recall if it was the Greek or Arugula Fresco, but it was ok. Also had the Grilled Flank Steak with citrus herbs, vinaigrette/escabeche, fingerling potatoes and sweet corn purée which was pretty good. Overall food was ok."}
