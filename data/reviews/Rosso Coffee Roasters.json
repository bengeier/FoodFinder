{"text":"One thing that makes Caffe Rosso unique is their cappuccino machine. This baby foams milk like no other machine does. I just can't get enough of the taste and texture of their drinks (cappuccino, latte, chai latte). 

Yes, the decor and atmosphere isn't overly impressive, but I usually just grab my coffee to go. Their spicy thai chicken soup is a must try!"}
{"text":"I love Rosso, and have been a faithful customer since my first visit in 2010, every opportunity I can get. I am very excited that they have been opening up new locations, especially one in Inglewood that is now open late! The Ramsay location has always served me well. 

On my visit today during my lunch break, I discovered that they had discontinued their Tomato Jam Sandwich, which was a favourite of mine. While sad, the barista helped me choose an alternative, a yam sandwich. I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised. 

I love the industrial look & feel of this location, and the friendliness of the staff. I will never pass up a Rosso Latte. Ever."}
{"text":"I've been to Cafe Rosso a few times for lunch or hot drinks when I need a nice walk away from work.  

The drinks are great - I've never been disappointed.  I recommend the Chai Latte, it's one of the best I've had!  The food is pretty good, though I wish there were some more veggie options on the menu.  

The customer service is excellent, very down to earth, friendly people work there.  Example - I ordered a proscuitto panini and when I got it, I couldn't eat it.  It was my own stupidity, I am very picky with meat and the cut was very fatty.  After eating one half of the bread, I spotted a server walking by and told her that I really wasn't enjoying it.  Most places would be like \"yeah, you ate some bread and that's just the nature of the meat you ordered\" but she was SO nice and offered me something else...apologized even!  (I replaced my sandwich with tuna which was full of green olives and capers yum!)  

I recommend Cafe Rosso for sure, it's a nice stop near the end of Stephen Ave.  Try that Chai Latte!"}
{"text":"great joe @ this inner city treasure"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome spicy chicken Thai soup!!  Coffee was great.  Very nice atmosphere and great service!"}
{"text":"Just enjoying my second cup of coffee here today. Very cool, trendy but casual coffee and lunch destination with a community feeling. Food is good- veggie options are very tasty. Bought a bag a coffee beans that is roasted for Cafe Rosso by Phil and Sebastian. It's direct trade coffee-no middlemen, so the farmers get a very fair price, which hopefully protects their livelihood and the environment too. 
There is plenty of parking, and it's free.
Great little place."}
{"text":"Today I sat down, at home, and savoured a Bodum load of Terroir Brazilian Daterra roasted \"Southern Italians Espresso\" made strong enough to use for axle grease. I you are a black coffee drinker, such as me, you will immediately notice after a little cooling that this coffee has a natural sweetness that lingers on your mid palette for almost an hour after drinking. It has fantastic body and flavour reminiscent of a rhum baba with dark chocolate syrup. In 2007 Coffee Review gave this particular product from GH 93 points out of 100. 

There is not much to say. I buy strictly beans and they carry the Terroir brand of George Howell from Acton, MA. Terroir is, simply put, among the finest coffee roasters on earth; the local Phil and Sebastian and Fratello Coffee Roasters are their equals. George Howell is the founder of the Cup of Excellence program where tens of thousands of different coffees are tasted from participating countries and and only about 2 or 3 percent make the list of excellence.

If is quality you seek, this is a must stop vendor of coffee beans."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm so glad they opened it up close to my work. The drinks are excellent, and the sandwiches are pretty tasty too. It has a nice relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best coffee in the city.  Best staff too. Only at Rosso is the drip coffee so delicious that sugar is totally not necessary. 

In addition to soy and lactaid milks, they are now stocking almond."}
{"text":"Yum. Seriously smooth and full bodied coffee, with yummy bakery treats and paninis on the menu as well."}
{"text":"Poor food- I just had a $10 sandwich from Rosso. The sandwiches have gone downhill and are now pre-made and heated on a panini grill. The chicken was cold, a pathetic lettuce leaf was draped over the top. It was like a gas station sandwich. 
Save yourself $6 and buy a  sandwich from the Esso around the corner."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite coffee shop. Coffee is always right and awesome. The staff are excellent and I am always greeted by name. The breakfast sandwich is fantastic as well as the meatloaf sandwich at lunch."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a coffee with your friends, nice environment & great coffee, one more thing also try the thai chicken soup because its awesome."}
{"text":"I love a great latte from a good coffee house but I've consistently had very slow service at Cafe Rosso! I'm not in a rush and am happy to wait for a well crafted 
latte' but the staff is SLOW and somewhat inefficient. There really is no comparison to Analogue or Cafe Artigiano's."}
{"text":"Someone at work picked up some scones from Caffe Rosso to share one day...I've been hooked ever since. The coffee is delicious, complete with a delightful little heart in the foam. I love their paninis! And of course their pastries are delightful! 

It's a it of a busy place at lunch time. Sometimes it's hard to find a place to sit! The staff are always pleasant and helpful. Try a blueberry scone with an Americano Misto...yum!"}
{"text":"Caffe Rosso is a neighbourhood gem for Ramsay and worth making the drive for their outstanding coffee and fresh baked breads.
They opened up a second location at the TELUS Convention Centre downtown that should be just as popular.
Decor at the Ramsay District is pretty cool too with Italian furnishings and contemporary art."}
{"text":"Had their hot coco. Very yummy. Great service. Great atmosphere. Love this place! Highly recommend it. Love the location as well."}
{"text":"Wife and I were vacationing in Calgary and ended up finding Rosso near the place we were staying. Really enjoyed their honey lattes as well as the breakfast sandwiches. Ended up coming here multiple times during our trip and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I almost always forget this place is here, until I know I need a good Java and great service.

These guys know whats up, and I hope more people remember them before giving into TIms or Sbux"}
{"text":"The spicy Thai chicken soup with the club sandwich is amazing.... So tasted like more."}
{"text":"Had a great panini there last week - chicken pesto. grilled just right, quite tasty. Went back today to grab a late lunch. They were sold out of my pesto delight, so tried the grilled veg. I'm sure it would have been great had it been grilled... it was microwaved, all spongey and a total diappointment."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the friendly customer service, sunshine and delicious chai tea. A lovely afternoon, tucked into the sidewalk of a busy city scape in Calgary."}
{"text":"Had a coupon for a free latte- it was really good. Ate here twice for lunch a few months ago and it was very good. They made an error - gave me the small soup when I paid for the larger one but corrected it without too much fuss :)"}
{"text":"I visited Rosso twice in 2 days as it is very close to my work and desperately wanting an alternative to Starbucks (seriously anything but Starbucks), I don't think I will rush back. While the people working are super friendly and helpful, my americanos just weren't great. I always order long shot as I love the crema on top, it looked as though I had ordered a plain brewed coffee. The first time I ordered a breakfast sandwich with my americano which was delicious. If you do decide to go to Rosso, I would highly recommend that. The second time I had a chocolate strawberry scone which I could've done without. I believe it was advertised as a strawberry white chocolate scone but in reality it was a mixed berry chewy scone with normal milk chocolate chips. Again, the americano was extremely watery and no creama and it took roughly 20 minutes for it. I'm very glad I tried Rosso but Im not going to rush back any time soon."}
{"text":"I visited Caffe Rosso for the first time last month. I was eager to try it because I heard such great things about the place. I'll admit, I wasn't wowed by the place. It looked like every other coffee shop in Calgary with it's own little red flair. Of course, I ordered my standard soy latte and also decided to get the breakfast wrap.

The soy latte itself wasn't anything spectacular, but the breakfast wrap was fantastic! They press it on a panini grill and serve it with a side of salsa. I am a big fan of breakfast wraps and this one was a perfect start to the morning, not too heavy, and kept me going till lunch.

Overall, it was pretty standard. What I did like about the place was the reading material they offered and the cute asian barista with the thick framed glasses. He basically made my morning."}
{"text":"Finally had the opportunity to try Caffe Rosso a few months back when a work meeting brought me downtown.  Love the atmosphere and seating in the place.  Service is generally nice and the Americanos taste great.  The treats and sandwiches always look good and recently I tried the 'healthy bar' and it was pretty yummy.

Stopped by again last week around 4:30 when they were cleaning up (we didn't know when it closed) and the guys were still nice to us when ordering and let us sit there and chat until our meeting started.  I definitely appreciated that since it was a little cold outside.  Definitely a great stop for coffee and/or lunch if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Rosso is a neighbourhood gem. Though many people rave about their coffee -  I am a tea drinker and like their selection of teas. Their sandwiches are good too. I'd love to see them expand their menu a bit in the future to include a few more items.

Rosso staff are always friendly and polite. The atmosphere is cozy and warm, though good luck getting a seat at certain times of the day! A small challenge and one to be expected at a busy, popular spot."}
{"text":"My favorite place to have a coffee in Calgary. working right across the street, I stop in almost daily. They have a great drip roast that changes every couple weeks and have very solid coffee drinks as well. The traditional capp is really great and is how a cappuccino should be done. 

Food options are not too vast, but are reliable. They have a wicked Thai Chicken Soup and a few sandwich/wrap options. The cheese biscuits are awesome (especially if they throw it on the panini grill for you!). 

There is also a well curated wine and beer selection to indulge in for an afternoon/early evening drink. 

If you haven't been yet, Rosso is the strongest coffee company in Calgary and is worth a try."}
{"text":"Cafe Rosso is a hidden Gem in Ramsay.  Tucked beside a warehouse office conversion this spot offers well prepared coffee (which they roast themselves), baked goods and light meals.  I enjoyed the breakfast sandwich although simple (eggs, bacon, bagel) the grainy mustard offered a flavour combo I was not use in a morning meal but worked great.

Vibe relaxing but awesome, Food/Coffee um-um, Service great"}
{"text":"On a work trip to Calgary and I find myself on a very cold and snowy day down on 8th Ave (a very cool pedestrian street) near City Hall. Freezing my butt off, I jump into the first warm looking cafe I see.

Thirty minutes later I'm walking away warm, satisfied, and full. A lovely fresh brie and apple sandwich along with a soul-soothing chai latte was exactly what I needed to go back into the snowy urban jungle and to the next meeting.

Decor isn't Caffe Rosso's strong point, but it seems that food is. Worth a try!

{"text":"This place is amazing... par none. There's no point writing an extensive review because everyone else says it all. But I highly recommend the Thai Chicken Soup!"}
{"text":"Eat the Thai Chicken Soup! (it really is, very, very, very good)
Drink fantastic P&S roasted coffee. (well prepared, and served in stylish and inoffensive, simply stamped paper cups on days you've forgotten your thermos.)
Enjoy the laid-back vibe, beautiful artwork, and chill staff. (or walk around the block and sit under The Device to Root Out Evil). 

Just be careful if you're ordering the Italian meat pannini sandwich, on two occasions I've sat at my office and had to pick slender rings of plastic sausage casing out of an otherwise delicious takeout sandwich. (though I've been back to order it since...it's that good)."}
{"text":"Food 10/10, service is always super friendly and you receive your items in a reasonable amount of time! Items are slightly pricy for what they are, but if you get the breakfast sandwich it is very reasonable and life changing :)"}
{"text":"I visited this coffee place with high expectations. I've had their coffee at local restaurants and I felt as though they were always great. Why not try an actual shop of theirs. To my disappoint the coffee was terrible. I ordered an Americano and it arrived with no crema. It's colour was similar to red rose tea. It wasn't very dark and it oddly tasted burnt. Perhaps the baskets were dirty. The service was still good but unfortunately, their coffee didn't meet my expectations. Maybe their places serve darker roasts or maybe it was an off day for this location."}
{"text":"Really love their lattes and coffee and it tastes way better than the five-bucks franchises.  Staff are always pleasant and accommodating.  And it has a nice atmosphere. This place gives Cafe Beano a run for the best coffee house in Calgary."}
{"text":"Great place for a morning coffee break,  afternoon coffee break,  or any time you just want to order sit at a coffee shop to work on your laptop. Their coffee and staff are amazing. I left my wallet there once and didn't realize it until they called me later in the day to notify me it was missing. 10/10"}
{"text":"Ah, coffee. You smell so good, you taste so good... And now as a result I might even get a faint headache if I don't have you every day.
One of the first coffee places I was taken to in Calgary was Rosso in Ramsay and it was a pretty great introduction. Super cute, great coffee and an amazing brunch sandwich in a cheddar scone. I still sometimes have dreams about that scone.
I went to the Rosso in Victoria Park to buy a bag of coffee beans, and the staff were super helpful. The guy behind the counter came around to show me the different options and to tell me which was his favourite (which I always want to know!) and even grabbed me a sample of it to try before buying. The bags of beans start at $17, there's light and medium roast options, and they can grind the beans up for you on the spot if you don't have your own grinder.
I also noticed that they have a Friday happy hour (2-6pm I think?) with $4 beers and $5 wines which almost distracted me. But I'm sure I'll be back.
And yes, the coffee was super tasty."}
{"text":"Found myself here meeting a colleague and it served its purpose well. The staff were friendly and chatty. The decor is nice. However, what I enjoyed the most is the relaxing atmospheric vibe I was feeling here. Though there were a few customers inside, I hardly noticed them. Maybe it was the company or the natural light, but I just felt good here.

I ordered a Chai Latte and it was delicious and at the perfect temperature. I do wish, however, that they had a more expanded menu. It seemed more limited than similar coffee places. All-in-all a great experience."}
{"text":"Oh my! Awesome! We had the breakfast sandwich on a made-from-scratch cheddar baking powder biscuit with stone ground mustard, poached egg, and thick slice of bacon. And the coffee was hot and strong. Don't be put off by location or how it looks from outside."}
{"text":"This neighborhood coffee shop was a former little wine bar that kept most of its previous components while adding great coffee and lunch eats to its offerings.

The set up is an artsy high ceiling loft with wooden chairs and tablesthat invite a hip crowd comprised of business people, locals and students alike to meet, get work done or just sit and people watch.  The coffees are great and they have a little retail rack next to the counter, to purchase some of the organic ground goods to take home; nice!

In the midst of a hostile takeover or writing a song? You can be sure the surroundings will keep everyone grounded and creative thoughts flowing through the crowd while sipping some good Java; indeed."}
{"text":"I don't generally walk around that area in the morning, but this time I did and they had a sign with \"homemade white chocolate blueberry scones\" so they had me at that :) so I got a latte too and both were really good. Scone super tasty moist and flavorful yet not too sweet that you get tired of eating it or anything and homemade? even better! 

I always put sugar no matter if it's a black coffee, latte or mocha, this time i decided to try it with no sugar and it tasted great, creamy strong coffee hmm

Super friendly staff and nice ambiance!"}
{"text":"Caffe Rosso is one of those places where you can grab a great coffee, enjoy some baking, have lunch and not feel bad about lingering. I have held many morning meetings here over a latte and scone and there is something remarkable that happens when we do 'business' in a relaxed atmosphere while breaking bread together."}
{"text":"stopped in for a cappuccino. was very nice. a quiet Sunday morning to relax and some good tunes playing.  will stop in again"}
{"text":"I love how Caffe Rosso loves coffee.  It should go without saying, but I think this is a point that some other coffee shops are missing.  Their baristas pull off being coffee geeks without being unapproachable or pretentious.  They serve Phil & Sebastians coffee, and take pride in making sure it is freshly roasted and ground.

I tried a pour over coffee for the first time here, and it was a lot of fun watching the technical elements of measuring everything out and carefully pouring the water.  The resulting product was pretty incredible, and had a depth of flavor that you rarely get in a cup 'o joe.  It came served in a wine glass, which added to the experience of my 5pm coffee.  And take note that it is an experience - a good pour over takes time, so don't order one when you are already 5 minutes late for your next meeting.

The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, with wooden tables and chairs brightened by red decor accents.  It definitely is the type of place that makes you want to sit down, stay awhile and enjoy your coffee experience.  We were there during a slow time, but I think I might be hesitant to try and enjoy this experience during the morning coffee rush.  A few points for improvement:  the tables are awesomely rustic, but uncomfortably bumpy.  Rustic rocks, but when I'm trying to slide my perfection of a drink across the table, the bumps make me sad.  I also tried to pitch Rosso to my ****bucks loving sister, and she pouted when they told her they had no caramel... But the latte art made her happy.  So yay!  I like CR.  They are great for coffee lovers, and by adjusting a few small points they will appeal to everyone.

Review #6 for Yelp's 30 Day Review Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"I was  bit put off by Caffe Rosso because I ordered a vanilla latte & they told me (a bit snottily) that they don't have flavored syrups there.  I understand that they have great coffee but some of us prefer to have vanilla or something with our coffee.  It doesn't mean that we are morally inferior.

Anyhooo....they did have a mocha option so I ordered that.  Oh my....best mocha I've ever had.  Which means I will go back even though they think I'm a eeejit for trying to order a vanilla latte."}
{"text":"I visited the Inglewood location for the first time and am very pleased! The vegan mulligatawny soup was delicious and my soy latte was awesome too!!! There is free 1/2 hour parking across the street and I lucked out on one spot. They were very busy for 2:00 PM on a Monday. I wanted a seat on the comfy couch but it was full."}
{"text":"Overall they are excellent and I am a regular.  They have great coffee, good food and a nice ambience. I wish they had large sized mugs like they used to. They switched to take out cups for their large and it is not as good. On occasion, the lattes or cappuccinos have not been hot enough and a few times the Thai soup has been too thick and old like it had sat too long. The service, food and ambience has been good overall. They have muffins and breakfasty things that are good. I will continue to frequent here.

UPDATE:  March 9th 2016.  I have developed a dairy intolerance so i tried their soy milk latte and it was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rosso is unassuming from the exterior. You'd never know a coffee house was here. Inside you will find a warm and inviting coffee joint perfect to meet friends, have a meeting or do some work at the coffice. Rosso roasts their own beans so occasionally you get to see the roaster in action. Lattes are always stellar. Their baked goods aren't quite as consistent but they seem to be making a few changes. Try the breakfast sandwich or the bagel bomb if you are peckish."}
{"text":"Yowsers, your prices are ridiculous high. Not going back.
Over $3.00 for a cheese biscuit...yikes!"}
{"text":"THANK YOU Rosso Coffee. For the best cup of coffee I've had in weeks. Visiting Calgary from Seattle on business. I walked all around downtown and the awful +15 (I get it, it's cold, but your streets are depressing). Looking for the REAL thing, figured I'd recognise a real coffee shop if I saw one. I'm not a snob, I just want good coffee and I can tell the difference. I was about to give up my search when I came upon the Stephen avenue cafe. Had a traditional cappuccino, which was so soooo good, maybe perfect. Ahhh. Now my mood is lifted and today is a lovely day."}
{"text":"A friend of mine wanted to get together before I head out of town this weekend and he suggested we meet up at Cafe Rosso. Having never been before, I didn't let the opportunity pass me by. Boy am I glad!

Cafe Rosso is *AMAZING*. I don't even know where to start. I love the atmosphere, the staff is incredible and they serve a MEAN espresso/coffee. Plus it's almost sacrilegious to call this place a coffee house considering they go above and beyond! I'm talkin' muffins, scones and homemade bread served FRESH out of the oven, as well as soups, fresh paninis, wraps, yogurt cups, homemade granola bars, and the list goes on and on.

Plus they offer unlimited and free WIFI for all their customers.

Seriously - this place has got it all.

If you're already a regular, I am joining your team. if you've never been, then isn't it time you experienced one of the 5 star business in our city?!?!? GET ON IT!"}
{"text":"Two words, sweet latte! It's there latte sweetened with honey and it's addictive. Service with a smile and atmosphere much more laid back than Deville. If your in down town near Stephen Ave. make the effort to hit up Rosso!"}
{"text":"Our first visit was great in fact we decided to go back because of it. Our second visit was disappointing, my wife ordered a traditional cappuccino but was given a large cup and so she went back and repeated her order. She was then given second small sized cup. It was a to go order and so we drove off. When i took a sip it was terrible, it tasted like burned coffee beans. The guy must have used the same spent coffee on the same portafilter. Anyway, will try other coffee roasters out there instead."}
{"text":"So, I have been here a couple of times now. The first time was great. Great coffee that they roast on site, which... yeah, if you've never had freshly roasted coffee, toss out the bag in your pantry and head on over. It makes Sbux taste like bong water. The ambiance is really mellow with cushy couches, local artwork on the walls, and friendly baristas.

Friendly, absentminded baristas.

I waltzed in bleary eyed and clearly exhausted, and proceeded to wait 20 minutes for an Americano on an early Saturday. If I hadn't gotten caught up in conversation with pals; Rosso would've been coronating the Queen of Surlyville, especially since everyone who ordered after me got their caffeine in a timely fashion.

Luckily, when it arrived, it was cozy and worth waiting for. So, the one star isn't so much for the 20 minute wait, but the barista making me feel forgotten about. 

Bring a pound of their Kenya roast home, and forget all your worries. It's delicious taken black. Not a hint of bitterness, and slightly fruity."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee. Really recommend it.  Also, it is located in an interesting location which is cool to check out if you enjoy discovering the city like I do."}
{"text":"Staff is very nice, coffee is amazing and plenty of power outlets everywhere if you are planning to get some work done. This place is a hidden gem :)"}
{"text":"Made the walk from downtown/CBD and it was definitely worth the walk. Had the breakfast sandwich, which was fantastic. Best cheddar biscuit I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I liked how this place was in the middle of no-where and probably very handy to people working in the SE industrial area. If hadn't been for the spot-specific coffee yelpy adventure, I would never had made the trip. I doubt I will ever go out of my way to return as it didn't knock my socks off, but if I were in the neighborhood, I would be fine to stop in for a cawfee and a bite.

I had an americano with room for milk & a panini for lunch. The coffee was good; the panini was okay. I liked the atmosphere, although it was kinda strange to have only one row of couches & tables with a big empty area in the between the seating & the counter. Maybe this is useful on a weekend, as Wendy says it gets busy. I don't know. Otherwise, it was a laid back place to be, and I was glad to try it out.

It definitely is a diamond in the rough as far as location goes, and other than this, I'm not sure I'm ranting or raving. Just a positive sounding, \"Meh!\" and a smile from me."}
{"text":"I used to come here every day when I worked at Freedom Chiropractic and Massage, and let me tell you: the meatloaf on rye sandwich is to die for. The bread is always warm, the meatloaf is juicy and well seasoned and the tomato and cheese add a perfect balance to the whole sandwich. 
Every sandwich is paired with classic ruffled chips when served to stay, but you can also get a soup and panini combo, and I always get the spicy Thai chicken soup and it is DELICIOUS. It's got chunks of chicken and vegetables all in a creamy broth with lots of seasoning. 
The atmosphere is casual and quiet, with a lot of business folk coming in the door. It's always clean and the staff are very friendly. 
This place is definitely worth visiting!"}
{"text":"I love Rosso Coffee absolutely the best coffee in town
Like Inglewood location also Ramsey"}
{"text":"I chose to review this specific Rosso location because I feel it is the best one. My experience has been they consistently deliver excellent traditional cappuccinos - which is my go to coffee. I've had a few of the sandwiches and they were all excellent. Afternoons are relatively quiet and you can easily find a spot to settle into. Pricing is very good compared to other wannabe vendors in the city with lower quality. At Rosso I find the overall quality of the staff, service and beverages to be consistently excellent. The only negative to this location is that parking is very limited and kinda pricey. I will finish this review by saying that, if I had a friend visiting Calgary and looking for the best coffee spot I would tell them to go to Rosso on 11th. Btw, every 10 beverages you get 1 free."}
{"text":"After driving around for a breakfast joint that didn't have a line up out the front door we decided to check out cafe rosso in inglewood. I have to say I think the offering of breakfast joints in Calgary is all pretty boring.I miss Avenue diner. Anyways our breakfast sandwichs and coffee at Rosso where great. It was a chilled out joint to just relax, catch up on the Saturday Globe, and enjoy the sunshine. I be hiding out here often."}
{"text":"After years and years of trying to visit this place. I finally landed @ Cafe Rosso. Its located in the strangest location (just off the blackfoot and past the train tracks) and if you don't like traffic circles you won't like going here.

Rosso's does a great cup of Americano, at least in my opinion. Unlike other cafe's I've been too, I found that I didn't have to muck around with it too much. I should have jumped in and had the thing black, but alas I am not a coffee hardcore. They also have a small but great tea selection, which beats the packets cafe's carry and try to pass off as gourmet tea. How hard is it to keep a shelf of loose leaf tea? Come on respect the tea-drinking market here folks. Anyways I also had one of their muffins- a banana chocolate chip concoction- and it was deliciousness to the max!

The staff were friendly once you get to chatting with them and the place wasn't too crowded for a Sunday afternoon. Rosso's sitting area was very comfy and I think encouraged strangers to take a chance in friendly small talk.

Alas, the main reason for my review. An hour to closing time, one of the baristas and a frequent patron decided to brew coffee using the siphon coffee method. Some intense chemistry lab contraction was pulled out and in case you're wondering:

http://youtu.be/wjH1hzl-Iq0

They got hilariously secretive bout the whole thing and insisted it wasn't offered on the menu because  \"so many variables can go wrong\". As if I wanted another cup of coffee after two Americanos!?

But guess what? I'm letting everyone know on the YELPERnet that you guys have this method on special request. 

Take that, secret society science coffee club!"}
{"text":"\"Oopsy - I made a poopsy!\" 

Pardon me? Really?

Just imagine... you're sitting in the quaint and cozy Caffe Rosso in Ramsay, just south of Inglewood and you smell something funny... not \"funny, ha ha,\" but (sniff... sniff) \"this milk smells... funny.\"

That's when you realize your little one has used their diaper for the reason it was made for... oh, and you've forgotten your diaper bag (cause that happens - trust me, I did).

Well, have no fear, Caffe Rosso is here to save your day, your lunch and a pending diaper rash!

Not only does Caffe Rosso have a proper change table in the customer's spacious washroom, they also have diapers - three different bags of diapers... sizes 1, 2 & 3... and what's more - they're Huggies (not some generic no-name that are poor fitting and often results in some kind of unexpected rash).

This is a pretty big deal - never in 3 & half years as a parent have I come across a coffee shop that had diapers in it. NEVER! Which means - IF you're that parent who brought your little ones on a coffee date and you've forgotten to restock the diaper bag with diapers or you've forgotten to bring the diaper bag altogether (and let's face it, it happens to everyone at least ...um ...ah ...at least once or twice) - the've got you covered!

Okay, what about the rest of the Caffe? You know what, it's pretty cool too. A bit of an industrial feel to it. 

The first thing I noticed was a big, bright and spacious coffee shop. Room for everyone - staff & customers! 

Loads of space for customers - coffee tables, cocktail tables, lounge chairs and sofas. 

Patio seating with lots of south exposure... sun. Lots of sun.

Free WIFI - however I didn't see any available power source and I looked pretty hard as my battery died after 40 minutes - I know, I need a new battery.

The order counter is quite large - a lot of room for everyone (staff and customers a like) to order their favourite.

Choices - coffee, tea, assorted juices, water, snacks, etc. 

The staff - very courteous. Actually, the best thing I noticed about the staff was their genuine willingness to serve you - you could tell they enjoyed what they were doing and they made me feel right at home.

Washroom facilities... ya, we covered that. Nice big bathroom. A bit on the dark side. Black walls, vanity, toilet and flooring... and they have diapers! Did I mention they have diapers?

Oh - and LOADS of free parking!

How could Caffee Rosso move from 4 Stars to 5?
- access to power. I'm not looking to hang out for half the day, I just don't have a very good battery and I don't like losing power.
- the bathroom could be brighter... a bit dark in there.
- the bathroom wasn't dirty but it could use a regular spot check and the small waste basket emptied... a few bits of rolled up paper towel on the floor. True, customers could actually put garbage in the... garbage... 
- my vanilla latte was average... I actually didn't taste any 'vanilla'. Weird.

Bottom line, I'm a fan and I'll be back again..."}
{"text":"This is a really great spot for a delicious coffee on Stephen Ave. Rosso has all the hipster-ness required to serve an incredible cup of joe, but not enough to make it feel unapproachable or Elitist. That's a fine line you walk, Rosso, and I'm fully impressed how you've managed to strike the perfect balance. 

It's bright, sunny and a good place to either stop in for a quick coffee and sandwich to go, or to hang out and chill a little bit. There's plenty of table space for meeting up for , and a small bar along the wall if you'd like a spot to be by yourself.

I like how you get a little mason jar of ripple potato chips with your sandwich. As Montrealers discovered a long time ago, this is the perfect side for any kind of Deli Sandwich.

There've even got a sunny south facing patio - the perfect spot to enjoy an iced espresso, soak up some rays and do some 8th Ave people watching."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, awesome staff, and really good \"to go\" coffee. Get the Americana or the Nutella coffee! In a city of coffee microrosaries it's hard to find one that stands out. We went twice in 2 days! It's a must if you're in Calgary. 

Also, go to Calgary."}
{"text":"A wonderful coffee shop where you wouldn't expect a wonderful coffee shop, but were hoping you'd stumble across a wonderful coffee shop. Voila! Caffe Rosso: a coffee shop that I'd go as far to say is... really really great! Ha!

The sandwich signs, those foldable wood signs that don't resemble any sandwich I've ever eaten, are really important for finding this place. Well, that and a map on your phone. Use both FTW! 

If you're expecting to find a scrap metal yard or a heavy duty diesel repair shop, you're in the right place. Walking through the doors of Rosso is to step into an entirely different, coffee loving world. The warm smell of fresh roasted beans, a mix of rustic and modern design with brick walls, glass tables and those cool looking but uncomfortable backless chairs. To me, Rosso is the kind of place that is comfortable enough to enjoy your full cup of coffee, but you might not want to sit down with your laptop for too long.

 There's something about watching a roaster in action and Rosso's is out there in the open for you to see. It's interesting, calming, and you just can't take take your eyes off it - like a caffeine making Zamboni!

The food I've had is delicious. I'd be happy to go out of my way to recommend their breakfast sandwich. It's a fun excuse to eat grainy mustard in the morning!

Personal Review Milestone: #200!!!"}
{"text":"Wow this place really is as good as the review's say! 

I went here over the weekend with my girlfriend and I must say I am amazed. The coffee is hands down the best in Calgary, the staff are friendly, and the food was excellent too.

For lunch I had a non-fat latte \"kid's temp\" - which came to me with a smiling face (will post picture later), a California turkey club panini (turkey, guacamole, tomato, cheese, mustard) and Thai chicken soup. It was delicious. The soup was perfectly spiced and really fresh, defiantly homemade. 

I am going to make this place my new hang out and spend a lot of time there!

The atmosphere is very appealing too and I have made a list for you:
1) They use halogen track lighting, so the colors are enhanced and it feels warm and cozy. Ceiling is not too high but not too short. There are beams that are very relaxing to stare at.

2) The shape of the room is a square rectangle. This makes it warm and cozy and you feel as if you were home in your living room. Let me give you a quick example of what does not work: Phil & Sabastian's on 17th is one large long rectangle. The order counter is huge and tables line the long room. It makes it feel cold and people are always walking past you; ick. The square rectangle works.

3) The restaurant temperature is 74F (22C) not the typical cold Calgary 70F/20C. You feel warm and can stay all day and relax without freezing. No drafts either, door faces a non-windy direction.

4) Cool sights out the windows - next to a old factory type retrofitted building; views of a 10,000 volt sign with a cloths line next to it, cool old door thing, cool old building lights, and other views. Also there is some great artwork on the walls. Impressionistic stuff... I love it!

5) Chairs are soft, yet still firm and the tables are round glass ones - very cool looking and just the right size. There are also very comfy leather couches, plenty of plug-ins for laptops, and a good amount of tables but not too many that it feels too big.

6) Did I mention free Wi-Fi?

7) There is Splenda (What is with all these places in hating Splenda and only serving stevia. Let consumers have their choice!)

8) Good selections of free newspapers.

9) Decent scones and baked goods with a changing selection.

10) Good plates with funky shapes but not too weird; the soup and sandwich was served on a round cornered rectangle plate. It was just the right size and unique but not to the point where it draws too much attention or sacrifices functionality. It sounds stupid but this is very important. The cups for lattes are also very nice. Easy to hold, and come with these little spoons. Seriously sweet!

11) Independently owned  and supports other local businesses

12) Nice bathrooms - clean and contemporary with change tables and stuff for mom's/dad's

The list goes on and on; I love this place for every little detail. It is just plain perfect in every way and I plan to spend a lot of time and money there over the next few years."}
{"text":"\"Yes - we do have paninis\" read the sandwich board sign. And while it may appear quiet depending on what time of the day you saunter in, Caffe Rosso can fill up and file out much like a heartbeat. 

But they are right -- they do have mighty fine paninis. My wheat of choice? A turkey club complete with avocado, tomato, lettuce, turkey and bacon. But that's not all -- the all was the pickle garnish on the plate! Overall, it's a small portion, but the grill is good to go and with all of the hunger crushing fillings, chances are you'll be satiated. 

There are a few plugs along the back wall, free wi-fi and my favourite - a simple, clean coffee station (see pic attached). Oh, and my americano was a tasty bevvie to boot!"}
{"text":"Ok we found it.  If you like and appreciate the coffee you will appreciate this place.  Yum.  Great roast and great brew.  Great job.  I had a latte and my wife had a sweet latte (made with honey). I think we will buy some of their home roasted beans as well.  Will be back."}
{"text":"A new, refreshing and very contemporary coffee shop located in downtown Calgary in the newly built National Music Centre StudioBell. A colleague and I decided to try this little coffee shop on our lunch break. The atmosphere is stunning and I believe it's the National Music Centre that obviously adds the compliment.  Very fitting that this coffee shop is locally owned and true Calgary. Rosso Coffee Roasters offers all sorts of coffee and tea and snacks such as muffins and cheese biscuits. However, my colleague and I only settled on coffee. I will say the prices are that of any barista coffee house.For all the non-dairy drinkers in the city, Rosso Coffee and Roasters offers all coffee beverages in Lactaid Milk, Soy, or Almond Milk. The service was friendly and warm and even topped off with a heart on my small soy mocha. The best part was, flipping through the retro records and albums of some of the most amazing Canadian artists and that was truly the highlight of my visit at Rosso Coffee and Roasters today. Albeit, the merchandise, mostly all relevant to the National Music Centre is quite costly. Beautiful art pieces from exceptionally talented Canadians are displayed. Very good and worth the stop if you are in the area."}
{"text":"A nice addition to the area. I think the space was a bit bare for me to feel like I could sit here and hang out for a bit. Good mocha and had the wifi from the music center. Very bright and open. Not a place to sit and work but a nice drop by to have a coffee. Was very busy and vibrant. Music was great and staff were friendly."}
{"text":"With about 30 minutes to spare before my bus Red Arrow bus left for Edmonton, I asked an attendant if there would be anywhere I could grab a quick lunch. She recommended I give A&W a try. However, I saw a sign promising Montreal Smoked Meat at Caffe Rosso. I walked in only to find a line about 5 people deep.

So then I checked out A&W, only to find nobody at the counter. So I decided to deal with the line at Caffe Rosso.

And despite the easy going and friendly nature of the people who take your order, the line moved fairly quickly and I had my Smoked Meat sandwich within 5 minutes of my arrival.

And while the sandwich was a fairly standard Panini, it surely beats a Teen Burger."}
{"text":"Thanks for the suggestion Yelp! The hotel I was staying at had a Starbucks in it and I really wanted to try out something new while I was in Calgary. Rosso was top billing for cafes within walking distance so off I went. When I got inside I headed straight for the pastry display, even though their selection of breakfast sandwiches looked amazing. As I was looking at the scones debating what deliciousness I would be consuming for breakfast Call Me Maybe, the summertime hit of 2012 came on and totally threw me off. For being a trendy/hipster cafe in DT Calgary I was not expecting that first thing in the morning. 
It seemed like the staff at Rosso agreed because all at once everyone behind the bar was just yelling \"NO! NOO\" and then the music immediately changed to Paul Simon then to Prince and then to Mungo James. 
I appreciated that they realized the horror of what came over the speakers and rectified it with more appropriate music. 
If ambience is what you care about, Rosso has got you covered. The coffee and scone were really good too!"}
{"text":"On one of the walks I found in a book titled Calgary's best walks and stumbled on my first Rosso Coffee establishment. I know now that they have many locations. The americano was good and what I needed today. Quaint, nothing fancy and friendly people. Quiet no frills place with outdoor seating. They did not do a dark roast..... too bad."}
{"text":"We just got americanos but they were our favorite in downtown Calgary. The atmosphere is nice and clean and service was fast."}
{"text":"Very clean, but comfortable environment. Caffe Rosso staff enjoy being there--they are pleasant and helpful. This location wasn't scheduled to open until later this year, but I'm glad they're open now.

Their espresso is excellent and their snacks are quality. Nothing seems over priced.

My only criticism is that they should have more plants or something to make the atmosphere a little more...something. Still, it's fine as it is."}
{"text":"not as nice as the other downtown location--this location with the exposed kitchen feels industrial. the staff are nice and you get the feeling customers feel comfortable here. a decent casual place to meet a friend for a coffee or tea."}
{"text":"I like their atmosphere! So nice and relaxing. Beautiful (rustic-ish?) kind of decor and minimalistic. They have cucumber water you can help yourself too. Tea and coffee and drinks in general are very expensive. Not sure if this is a Calgary thing? 6 dollars for a small matcha latte seems really pricy to me. I choose the muffin. It was ok- 3 dollar which is ok. Not the best tasting - quite greasy and you can see the grease on the muffin paper and on your hands. They don't have a lot of other selection for food."}
{"text":"I have my early morning meetings here often, and I love it, the coffees are great, the breakfast menu is good, a nice place to have a quick meeting or just enjoy your fav speciality coffees. A must try if your in the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"We've been a fan of this place since literally before it even opened. Colin even made their website. I love getting a hot chocolate and a pannini from Rosso. The owner is a nice guy and the staff is always pleasant just like him. Try a fresh muffin or a scone. You can buy bags of their signature coffee beans as well. The panninis are made fresh when you order them and come nice and warm. I love chicken pesto one and the veggie one the most. The cafe is very clean and modern looking. They had these loose leaf teas sold in a tin last time I was there that they were selling for local vendor. I tried a few and I really didn't like them. I have a cupboard with a collection of about sixty or so loose leaf teas to compare too. If you want a good coffee and maybe a pastry then skip the conglomerates like Starbucks and Tim hortons and support this local gem. Believe me when I say I in no way have to say any of this and I would have no issue telling you if it sucked. If you don't know our neighborhood very well you may have a hard time finding it. It's on 24th ave off spiller road, Ramsay's pretty small so as long as you find spiller road you should be able to find it."}
{"text":"Success! Love discovering new places! This is way out of the way for me, but I'm always on the look-out for quaint coffee joints! Love the industrial feel, and the minimalism. Free wi-fi, and delicious americano are a must, and Cafe Rosso delivered!"}
{"text":"This will be short and sweet. These dudettes make a mean ass cup of joe. The chicks there are cool as shit, they have next level swag and did I mention their coffee is amazing?

Look, I'm cranky on the best of days and shitty establishments really grind my gears. This place put a smile on my face on a snowy dull day. I would drive out of my way to come here now that I've fond this gem. Cudos!

They have such a cool location as well. You have to check them out. 

Let's see if they have the guts to post this on the wall."}
{"text":"Great addition to the East Village and the National Music Centre at StudioBell is pretty darn awesome too! This is a huge space with friendly staff, great lighting and floor to ceiling windows so you avoid that closed-in-a-coffee-shop-feeling.

The only reason that it's not 5 stars is that they serve \"drip\" coffee....they should really do the hipster pour-over method, so much better!"}
{"text":"Rosso now roasts their own coffee, and although it changes slightly from time to time as they use new beans, it is always consistently great!"}
{"text":"Went for a quick breakfast the other day while in town. Great coffee, food is pretty good, wish they had some fresh juices."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great Traditional Cappuccino and Sweet Latte... I got the Thai Chicken Soup two days in a row it was so good, for *breakfast* no less. I also got one of their beanies and it's so soft and I've gotten so many compliments on it."}
{"text":"I don't give five stars much. But for great espresso and pour over coffee. Alon with freshly made breakfast sandwiches and wraps. This place scores high.try their egg and bacon sandwich. I still crave the maple bacon. 

Conviently on the main restaurant street in Calgary. Near most large hotels. Forget their pricey breakfast and go for the walk to this great coffee place."}
{"text":"Saturday I was at the Hawker's Market and got to try some of Caffe Rosso's coffee. Yum I was hooked. Sunday we were out and about in the glorious Calgary sunshine and decided to find these guys because we wanted coffee.

Quite an interesting & unique neighbourhood. An eclectic mix of arts and almost too much industrial, but it works. The cafe has a ton of character both inside and out. Like a story being told over and over, but differently each time.

Loved the mix of people inside. Old, young, hipster, grunge. Lots of peeps around for people watching but also quiet at the same time allowing us to sit down and have a conversation.

Liked it. Staff uber friendly and helpful. A great little space."}
{"text":"If you are in this part of downtown, close to Glenbow, or the Marriott, instead of going to a starbucks or some other chain cafe, try Rosso for some REAL coffee.

They have another location in SE where they produce and grind all their coffee, but in the downtown location, you can also buy bags of coffee and ask them to grind it to your liking.
Test, smell and taste the coffee before you buy!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice service, cool & comfortable atmosphere - what more could you ask for!

Took my 6 year old cousin here to work on his homework (I'm all about bribery when it comes to getting homework done).  We split a panini - which staff happily customized so my half could have no cheese while his oozed with it - and it was a hit.  This picky eater told me it tasted like a cheeseburger, and a pizza, but better.  Brilliant!

I also enjoyed a chai latte, and we split a chocolate muffin - yum!  Stayed for about 2 hours to bust out some math learning.

Only problem might be that there are only about 10 tables.  Not a super big issue when we were there on a Saturday afternoon, but I could see it filling up for sure."}
{"text":"Everyone around downtown is holding a Rosso coffee cup. Im travrlling, so of course I had to check it out. Just had a large cappucino and a gluten free banana loaf. The loaf was moist and delicious and very generous serving. The cappuccino was delicious with no bitter after taste and very smooth, however it had a very distinct flavour and aroma that I have never experienced. It tasted almost as if it was spiced. Nevertheless it was very good. $7.50 for both which is how much I would expect to pay. I would come back next time."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe in the East Village downtown. I've actually been trying to get in here for ages, but the hours are so strange that every time I've shown up, it's been closed. 

I finally had the opportunity to grab a bevvie here with my sister a few weeks ago. The place was DEAD - not sure if it was because it was a weekend or not. I don't drink coffee, so I need a good tea latte or something to get me interested in a place. They do not do any tea lattes. I believe there was a chai latte on there, but that was it. The guy working the till was a bit rude - when I asked about said tea latte, he looked at me like I had 2 heads. 

I do love the decor and the fact that they're licensed, but I don't love the coffee snob attitudes. We had a nice afternoon date but there is absolutely no reason for me to ever return here."}
{"text":"Coffee quality is good but the atmosphere is preposterous. Major hipster place with a smattering of snobs."}
{"text":"This cafe is adorable. I first stumbled upon them at the ingelwood night market. I purchased coffee beans but they were unable to grind the, at the market. Feeling bad they sent me to this cafe with 2 free beverages. The staff were very friendly and I was happy to have free iced lattes while I picked up lunch. Lunch was great and I'm really quite happy that they offer a coffee subscription program. When I move back to Calgary I'm definitely taking advantage of it!"}
{"text":"Say what now? There's a 3rd Caffe Rosso location? There sure is!

Awesomeness:
- The red chandelier hanging by the register. When you walk in the door, look up.
- The staff. They remember my drink orders! I've only been in a handful of times so far.
- The hours. Open later! Like, 9pm instead of 5 like the other two locations.
- Liquor permit! Yep, you can buy beer here too.
- The setup. I enjoy the mixture of large communal table, bar style seating and other tables for me and my friends.
- Free wifi! 
- Savoury cheese scones. You must try one.
- Patio. Yay patio! It's licensed too... and it faces north, so during ridiculous hotness, you can be totally shaded :)

Points I'm less fond of:
- the number of plug ins. There are only two. I keep managing to sneak into the table in the corner, but one of these days somebody else is going to be in there, my laptop will be near dead and instead of hanging out longer and drinking more coffee, I'll have to move elsewhere. Although that may be a good thing... getting me out to stretch my legs a little more.
- The little counters against the wall. I tried to set myself up there with my laptop on my very first visit so I wouldn't hog one of the larger tables just for me and my computer. Turns out it didn't fit and was too awkward to sit at. 
- Table and chairs. They're a little large... or maybe there are just too many of them? It's a bit awkward squeezing by people to pull one out for yourself when it's a bit busier.

Verdict: Go try the new Caffe Rosso location. Eat a cheese scone. If you're planning to camp out for a bit and get some work done, make sure your battery is well charged or that you're headed in during a slump (it's common coffee shop courtesy anyway to avoid hogging valuable coffee shop space. We laptoppers can work anywhere. Literally!) And don't forget to grab your coffee punch card. You'll be back for more. I promise!"}
{"text":"I have an occasional weekend love affair with Caffe Rosso in Ramsay. We sit together early in the morning, sipping coffee or tea and eating muffins. In those early hours, we have our privacy

I knew Caffe Rosso had a twin somewhere out there, I didn't expect to run into the twin in the middle of a Thursday afternoon downtown. Now when I'm craving my weekend joe, I know I can tide myself over with a little afternoon delight on Stephen Ave.

Across from the Glenbow, Caffe Rosso offers a variety of sandwich-type eats for lunch, and coffee and treats. On this particular visit, I found myself with a hot piping cup of an American Misto and a cinnamon chocolate chip scone. Plenty of seating and free wi-fi, it was an enjoyable little place to stop and set up shop for awhile. Although I enjoyed the quiet, I'd love to see Calgarians hit up spots like Caffe Rosso over the famous chains that appear every two blocks or so. There's just something about a well-brewed bean, it doesn't require anything more than being straight up black."}
{"text":"My first trip to Caffe Rosso was last September. I've been back a few times since, and all I can say is this spot keeps getting better. If only there were an option to give it more than 5 stars.

I popped in yesterday for an hour for a coffee and a muffin and to get some work done. The gals in line in front of me were trying to pay with debit, one of the staff got my order going while we waited. It seemed there was a problem with the machine. The debit was down. The girls didn't have any cash with them, neither did I. The nearest bank machine meant driving back into Inglewood. Oh dear.

I've seen places shrug their shoulders at this and simply say \"sorry, the debit isn't working\" and leave it upto the customer to go find some cash and come back, or leave. The staff at Caffe Rosso on this day sent the two girls to go sit down and said they'd still bring them their lunch order and let them know if the debit came back online. They did the same for me with my coffee and muffin. An hour later, there was still no debit. The option? They printed out a receipt of what I ordered and asked me to come back again soon and settle up then. I offered to leave my name and number as well, I was told it wasn't necessary.

You can bet I'm going back today to pay for that muffin and coffee... and that I'll be back again after this. Not many places take the \"we'll serve you anyway and trust you'll come back and cover your tab\" road. You rock Caffe Rosso."}
{"text":"There's a lot of great coffee at the east end of Stephen Avenue now, with Insomnia in the Burns Building, Deville in Fashion Central and the newer location of Rosso in the Telus Convention Centre (this storefront was for several years the last holdout of the Grabbajabba franchise, next to A&W) and I love them all, but yesterday I stopped in at Rosso and had a macchiato made with their superb locally-roasted (by Phil&Sebastian) beans and it was just- wow. Time stood still. One of the best macchiatos I've ever had. Macchiato perfetto.

Sandwiches and baked sweets are excellent too. Nice relaxing space to boot."}
{"text":"Beautiful design, and absolutely outstanding coffees. Rosso has come a long, long way since its first cafe in Ramsay."}
{"text":"NMC is a treasure and it has a fantastic coffeehouse on its ground floor. Rosso serves dependably excellent coffees and the integration with the museum is seamless - I wish every museum had its souvenir shop in a classy third-wave coffeehouse. Very, very well done."}
{"text":"Lattes excellent, Thai soup and cheese scone so good!! Nice little cafe!! Great service too!!"}
{"text":"My 1st visit to Rosso was short but sweet.
I discovered it by accident whist searching for the pay meter in the Telus Convention Center.  Rosso is located right next to said pay meter, on the ground level of the TCC - there's an entrance from inside the lobby, and a street entrance on 8th avenue.

The Barista conveniently noticed that I was in a hurry, so gave me the low-down on the place whilst I rummaged through my mega bag for my wallet.  The pastries are made fresh in house everyday; they also make soup in house, and a nice selection of paninis!
(check out my photo of the menu board for menu samples...)

Trusty Americano ordered, muffin stuffed in mega bag, now comes the search for the condiment stand.  Unfortunately there was only skim milk & cream on the stand... gross & gross.  No worries, Mr. Barista happily provides the whole milk, but my Americano is too hot, maybe even burnt...

This is the only reason for the 4 stars.  If you have Caffe, Café, Coffee, Java, Joe, or any translation of the word in your business name, then your core product surely is coffee.  IMO, this means you need a damn good cup of brew, and an even better shot of espresso.  As espresso is the key ingredient in my Americano, please don't burn it :((

Other than that slightly unnecessary rant - Rosso is pretty splendid and I will definitely check out the Ramsay location.
KLM"}
{"text":"Cafe Rosso is quite a gem.

Great espresso and freshly baked tasty treats. Ramsey is lucky to have this spot - warm, comfortable interior, friendly employees.

I can normally find something sarcastic to say about everything but Cafe Rosso is just all around good. Sans sarcasm.

Check it out...but don't check it out too much, because I like feeling cooler than everyone else who hasn't heard of it yet."}
{"text":"I've been to the Caffe twice now.  The decor is simple but cool and the art is unique.  I enjoy sitting outside and even though it's not a scenic view, it's a warm place to sit when it's sunny and the chairs are comfortable.  

I find that indoors, the music is played a bit too loud and some of the chairs wouldn't be comfortable to sit on for long periods of time because a selection of them have no back rest.  Also, the mocha is only average and never hot."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee and one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've had in the city. The sandwich took a little longer than I expected, but if you're not in a rush it's worth it."}
{"text":"Alright Rosso. Here comes my smack down. 

Interesting hood - reminds me of this old artist colony in Bejing. So, with that being said the building/architecture you can't really take credit for. 

The drinks are decent, with vegan options. 

Staff? Ok, I'm a hippy from Vancouver, let me preface my next anecdote with that.......
The aloof hippies with dreads etc...that are too good for the customers, coffee and for general happiness, shouldn't work there. So when you're a goof, you could at least try to make my drink STELLAR so that I'll look past your failures and just give the place 4 stars for service, taste and locale/decor. 

You've failed the Rosso. Go to the box and feel shame."}
{"text":"Their sweet latte is my favourite. It's hard to compete with amazing espresso and Rossi definitely provides that!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Terrific coffee. Not many gluten free options. Fair enough. Few cafés have g-free options. I saw sandwiches with chips and hoped I could have the soup. Unfortunately not g-free. But soul and chips would be lovely. I mentioned that there were crumbs from the cookies and muffins ending  up on the gluten free banana bread. The cashier said he'd change it for next time and hadn't considered cross contamination. What a great attitude and reaction to my suggestion. No rudeness just positivity. I asked if it was ok to take out my lunch with my late and the staff were super nice about it. Most places won't let you do that so I'm grateful. Again absolutely fantastic late. Thank you. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Two words: cheddar biscuits. Seriously though, the cheddar biscuits are wonderful. I know that's an odd thing to emphasize about a coffee shop but when something is done right, it needs to be mentioned. 

Other than these biscuits, this is a a pretty standard coffee shop. The coffee is well made, there is a great selection of tea, and there are delicious pastries (even some gluten-free varieties). Really, I probably would give this place only 3.5-stars but the tea is delicious and I can't argue with those biscuits. 

The shop has a good number of tables and it's clearly used for business meetings during the day. There aren't sofas or comfy chairs so I probably wouldn't sit all day, but it's a a great place for a quick bite or a conversation over coffee."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and I really enjoyed my sandwich ... The coffee was great as well... The place is very small and not fancy, but is a cool place to go once in a while ..."}
{"text":"Rosso coffee, has been given a good review and they are on the list for breakfast, but the selection is very limited for breakfast food. The coffee and service was great and they are really friendly! They are a coffee roaster, so they have a nice fresh coffee aroma:)"}
{"text":"My first experience of good coffee in Calgary.  After years of Starbucks, I didn't know what a latte was supposed to taste like.

I can thank Caffe Rosso for getting me interested in espresso (my wife thanks you, too, for the hundreds of dollars of equipment I bought to feed my new habit).

I once drove 40 minutes into the city -- during rush hour -- JUST to go to Caffe Rosso and get a latte.  I didn't regret it one bit!

Great atmosphere, awesome baristas, and of course, amazing coffee.

The only thing I'm disappointed with are the short business hours (only open until 5), but it's probably justified based on where they are in the city.  Also, if you're a fan of flavored lattes, they do not have syrups for their drinks here."}
{"text":"Food is quite good (although selection is limited). My turkey club was unique and tasty. The coffee is delicious too - some of the best I've had downtown. 

However, the service is a disaster and the staff seem disorganized; some of them are downright grumpy. This isn't so much a restaurant as a coffee house with a single panini grill in the back. 

Overall, good food but not an experience I'll rush to repeat."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmm ... Caffe Rosso has some of my favourite espresso in Calgary.
I don't know ... is because they use Illy coffee? I really don't know! But it sure does taste good!

I remember Caffe Rosso from when it was brand new. I was impressed with the \"industrial chic\" design and the bright layout. Still am.

Truly a unique coffee shop in a unique area with unique espresso.
I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Nice example of one of those \"off the beaten path\" places you're just not aware of... Until you're aware of it! 

Tucked away in Ramsey in the dirt parking lot of the Ramsey exchange project this cafe is really cute. A limited menu of coffees, snacks, baked goods and wraps makes for a change of pace from the usual coffee hang outs. The casual and clean atmosphere with tall bar tables persuaded us to stay for a bit which wasn't the original plan. We enjoyed a latte, cappuccino and muffin (which was pretty delicious). The coffee was superb and reminds me that my usual Starbucks latte is never up to par with cafes that pay more attention to the details. One of the best lattes in years to be honest.

Staff was awesome, friendly and casual, in a hip and \"cool\" way! Now that I have discovered this place I'll surely be back:)"}
{"text":"When you start a new job, all you can ask for is a *real* coffee shop to open up nearby. Caffe Rosso is most definitely a real coffee shop. I can't believe that I have 40 checkins here and still haven't reviewed it. Bad Yelper! If I wrote a sentence every time I checked in, I'd have a... (counts)... 40 sentence review! I wonder how many sentences are in an average review.... I digress.

This place is owned and operated by Cole, an awesome, friendly guy who is passionate about coffee. He always calls me by name. I don't even know how he learned my name, I don't remember telling him. But he greets me by name every time I come in. Talk about great customer service. He also has a pretty fantastic hipster moustache. Cole is always showing me the new coffee products they have, letting me sample different coffees from different places around the world. Delightful.

I always used to get pour over coffees here, which is the purest way to have your lifeblood, if you ask me. I think they took it off the menu, because it's technically difficult to make. But if you ask nicely, I'm sure Cole will hook you up. Their lattes are also masterful.

They used to sell Phil & Sebastian beans, but now they have started roasting their own. It was a bit of a learning process, but now they've got it down. My office gets our beans here every week.. usually about twice a week, since we are fanatics. They will fill up an environmentally-friendly jar for you. You can even subscribe to a bi-weekly delivery service. We make our coffee by the cup in an AeroPress which is a wonderful way to enjoy your go juice.

It's also a great place to grab a pastry in the morning, or a soup or sandwich for lunch. I highly recommend the white chocolate mixed berry scone. The Spicy Thai Chicken Soup is also to die for. I believe it's made by the Stock & Sauce Co in the Calgary Farmers' Market, but that doesn't make it any less delicious.

I've yet to come in here for a beer or to try the tapas menu but it does look appealing.

Great coffee. One of the Big 3 in Calgary, IMO. Phil & Sebastian, Analog Coffee, and Caffe Rosso."}
