{"text":"So the food here is five star, the service however is what ruins the experience. That airhead Julian is the worst and talks about the customers as if no one can hear him. When you sit at the bar there is never anyone there to greet you and if someone is they ignore you or stay over by the espresso machines and chat. Maybe both management and the owners either don't care about the costumer service experience or are airheads...like Julian."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere great selection of beers and wine. Ordered the avocado fries and overall they were good however the sauce they came with was too hot. Got ranch instead which I feel didn't compliment them very well.."}
{"text":"Buyer beware!   Happy hour menu $5 wine bogus ... charged $8 per glass. Waitress response was that the system was updated and that's what it rings up as and there's nothing she can do about it.  We pointed out that the menu says $5 and got nowhere.  Asked to speak to the manager ... not there of course.  This all would've been much more palatable if the waitress was sympathetic in any way or had provided decent service over the two hours we were there.  She couldn't be bothered ...  too busy runnng her fingers through her hair every 5 seconds!   (grossed me out!)   Amyway, make sure you ask before ordering if you are expecting happy hour pricing."}
{"text":"Went by to check it out and super friendly staff, great looking place.  Beautiful addition to downtown Phoenix, lots of small places to hang out, play games, beautiful patio!"}
{"text":"Fantastic spot! The live music put a pep in everyone's step. Excellent food with delicious vegetarian options. (For fellow vegans/vegetarians - they have soy milk and almond milk.) Love the Punch Card - great touch. Service was extremely friendly. And the desserts encourage me to run an extra mile every day just so I can eat here as much as I want. They are SO good. Overall, awesome spot for both day and night (which is no easy feat - bravo!)."}
{"text":"Starbucks has better coffee... Not much of an ambience of a old train station. Interior design theme conflicts with their menu. Looks more like a ghostbusters coffee stop. Suited for Halloween. Dine-in coffee served in disposable cups."}
{"text":"I love the simplicity of this place. The fact that it is open all hours is a plus.  A great place to stop for a bite or just hangout with friends. The food is really good!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere during the day to study. At night this is a great spot to stop for a drink. Their beer selection is always awesome."}
{"text":"Really cool coffee shop and bar.  For those trying to describe the décor it's steampunk with a bit of Gothic thrown in.  Really interesting and we'll done.  Service was great and friendly.  Not too busy yet but hopefully that changes.  Definitely check it out for something a little more interesting.  The music is basically trip hop.  Low key and chilled out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot in Phoenix. Great ambiance, great drinks, great entertainment. The Grand should honestly be the #1 spot downtown.  Seriously, get the food situation figured out. The food here is pretty darned good, but almost every time I've ordered it takes almost an hour to get simple dishes, to the point where I rarely get food anymore. Every time I talk to regulars this is their #1 complaint, which is echoed by the other yelp reviews.   Definitely come here."}
{"text":"Sorry. I missed the good service that others mentioned, even though I was seated in front of a service staff meeting. For my snack of avocado fries and beer, I received neither a napkin, utensils, water or a follow-up. The avocado fries presentation --a handful of slices of battered, deep fried avocado on a large bare white plate and a plastic ramekin for the condiment--made the $7 dish look especially cheap. The server also failed to offer amends when the service shortcomings were pointed out."}
{"text":"My first time at The Grand will likely be my last. Ordered $20 worth of food and drinks to have a Saturday afternoon of homework, only to find out minutes later that their WiFi is awful and doesn't work. I tried connecting forever, and then asked a worker to explain what was going on. He explained that when there are a lot of people at the shop (there were MAYBE 20?) WiFi just messes up and doesn't connect. So... a coffee shop with no WiFi. Nice! Never going there again. Regret that I ordered food before knowing this.   I came to Lux immediately after and what do you know! WiFi is amazing with ten times the amount of people. Don't bother with this place if you're attempting to do computer work. Nice lunch and breakfast? Sure. Homework/work? Nope."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been here many times over the last 6months. The vibe is relaxing and calm. The people that work here really engage you in. I work from here and I've never been disappointed The food is great the coffee and all its alternatives are amazing."}
{"text":"This is going to be a great place.  It's still ramping up, but I stopped by for a coffee this afternoon and was served a perfect macchiato.  Well done!     I'm very encouraged by the investment into this location, and I really hope the owners do well."}
{"text":"This place is totally a fusion of retro and modern design. It's very easy to get lost in the nostalgic history of this coffee fusion house. The interior is decadent and scrumptious. The manager, Bernadette, was amazing and full of information. Saw this place from across the St and was drawn in by its beautiful facade and design. The coffee was PERFECT and the pastry selection made it very hard to choose only one (so I chose two, a slice of quiche and a zesty lemon vanilla cupcake!) There was a live music show in the ballroom and it was amazing. This is a must try venue. I was totally happy with this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Gr8. I love it here. However can y'all plz get an air conditioner? It is perpetually hot, I don't know how u employees do it. Anyway, rlly a fan of this place tho 10/10 chai"}
{"text":"Website says late night menu is 10pm-5am. I go in at 1:30am and guy working behind the counter says kitchen is closed. So we asked about the \"ghost soda\" which is apparently their drink special and the guy behind the counter says \"I don't know what that is\" either the management is poor or this employee is lazy. Regardless I won't be coming back because of that awkward encounter."}
{"text":"2 Rats is my point of me posting here.   Well, let me start here.    I really like this place. I love the design of The Grand and feel that the place bears the potential of becoming a staple of downtown Phoenix.  I've been comfortable going there and not resorting to social media about the many downsides of establishments lack of management skills. However, the health safety issues are a real issue for me and everyone eating there  About a month ago I witnessed a rat crawl the wall at the placement of the pastry food and I reported it to a gal working.  Yet on another recent visit another rat crawl across the wall base. This is a very serious health hazard. I will get hold of the city about the establishment health violations.   I've repeatedly mentioned that their pastry food should to be encased to keep all the items cool and most importantly away from flies feeding on them... And surely rats are grabbing and tasting them."}
{"text":"Downtown for some business around lunchtime we saw this attactive spot with really good music playing on the sound system outside.  The decor very interesting and the menu looked good.   First sign of trouble is that ordering must be done at the counter, right at the register so if you don't know immediately what you want, it's awkward to block the counter while deciding.  The paper menus are dirty and wrinkled with fingerprints and food stains on them.   After ordering, we were told that we must stand and wait there for our beverage order because, even though we were given a table number, they only deliver food to the table, not beverages.  Ummm,  okay. We ordered the mac and cheese of the day and two Yardbird sandwiches.   When the food was brought, the server apologized for the long delay and we were dissapointed that the orders were not as described.  The mac and cheese was a small portion for $9.00 and was missing the critical ingredient of bacon that was supposed to be in it.   The sandwiches were missing listed ingredients, the chicken on my sandwich was dry and chewy, there was no sauce of any kind and the cook had opted to add raw jalapeños to the sandwiches which were not supposed to be there.  Big Change. They did refund us the $ for the mac and cheese but the whole experience was unpleasant.  I would return to have a beverage and enjoy the decor but I would not order food there again."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. Great food especially for the cheap price and great ice chai. A bit confusing that you have to order from the counter then get service to your table. We sat at the open bar outside. There is plenty of shade when it is sunny out. Decor indoors is also nice. It reminds me slightly of the types of restraunts/bars in downtown in Europe. Still need to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Good coffee, interesting food, and they still serve high end booze as well. The inside is very cozy and warm. Always music playing in the background and loads of seating."}
{"text":"The Grand checks so many boxes for a downtown food/drink establishment, especially in Phoenix. The location on Central is amazing walking / biking / light rail territory. It stakes a big claim across from the very busy Phoenix Public Market and its Saturday farmer's market. The building is so beautiful inside and out. So much to explore, and is great if you want to read or work, and just as good if you want a night out on a gorgeous patio, or in an intimate sitting area upstairs. The food and drink selection is great, delicious, and priced very well. I have come here several times for a myriad of reasons.  However, just out of my concern for wanting to preserve good things when they come through Phoenix, ESPECIALLY a decent restaurant, Cafe and bar like The Grand: the service is always at least, a shit show. It's clear that there is a poor communication among it's many moving parts. I can't imagine how cumbersome that must be to navigate if the aim is to provide at least par service. Food always comes out at different times for every guest, even on the same ticket. Drip coffee once took us 30 minutes to receive. Staff tends to avoid eye contact, or any contact during this time, instead of some reassurance or communication that everything will be coming at some point.  So why do we go back if the service is a huge question mark? The food, drink, and atmosphere are really excellent. The menu is well designed. I just want to try and stick it out and hope the kinks work themselves out for a place with SUCH promise. Some evening and bartending staff are exceptionally attentive, so that's nice to see. It's unfortunate that all anyone has to say about the Grand is that service and communication are a giant question mark on any given day. I wish this place well and bid it adieu."}
{"text":"Very cool coffee place with the total ambiance of the old train depot. Someone has put a lot of thought into small details. I was a bit disappointed with the breakfast omelette. It just was bland and no garnish offered. Salsa would have softened and added to the overall taste."}
{"text":"Come in at and for the second time in a row their WiFi was down and was told there was nothing they could do. To just wait for it to came back on. What kind of coffee shop is that?"}
{"text":"I had never been here and I'm so impressed!! It is soooo comfortable! There are many many places to sit alone, in a group, date etc. They even have a market inside where you can purchase things kind of like a grocery. It reminds me of Dean and DeLuca in NY! The wooden tables are so nice and not to mention, the service is great!!! Brett was AMAZING and recommended the yummiest iced coffee and Avocado Toast! And it's open 24hrs!!! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful, I love the ambiance and everything to do with it. Teas were great! I am in the lookout for great coffee places to work and I LOVE the fact that it is 24/7, I also love the fact of how clean it is. I guess the only thing I don't like is that I was really having problems with the WiFi connection. Which is pretty sad because I really enjoyed this place, but I really need WiFi for work. So I'll likely go back for them ambiance to read a book or socialize, but not on a regular place to work like I was hoping to find. Check out the outside sitting it is beautiful!"}
{"text":"Wasn't the best experience. The Custormer service was terrible and the food was over priced for the quality."}
{"text":"Coffee and food here are ridiculously good . Ambiance is exactly where it needs to be and everyone here seems to enjoy their job . You wanna vibey place with good energy to match ... Come here"}
{"text":"I'm saving the extra star here until I try the cocktails and food here. This spot is ridiculous it's eye candy for sure the train station arsty industrial vibe is awesome. Seeing the place is worth a visit. This place has the best coffee drink I've ever tasted in my life no joke. White Chocolate Lavender latte BOOM. That's all you need honestly lol. Such different flavors so creamy and herbal and just a perfect combination i got it with soy milk so it was even better. But that drink and the atmosphere here is worth 4 stars. The bar looks cool and so did the food, which I will try later. Also the fact that sanctum their hidden speakeasy-ish bar is here means that's their cocktail program has to be good, I'll try that too. I had fun and was like a kid looking around constantly to see what art or decor I could see and take in. Great place I love it. Check it out and get that lavender latter."}
{"text":"Old gay bars make the best coffee shops! We did the decorating for the rest of you! Great menu booze and coffee. The menu is a available all day despite what the print out say."}
{"text":"Had to see this place in person upon reading an article about its' new opening and I was not disappointed, though it was late so I did not try out the coffee I give the atmosphere and staff 5 stars, very cool place, I will be returning to  try the coffee upon my return to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Such a cool vibe! I am a big fan of the yummy, dessert type coffee drinks and would've given 5 stars if there was more choices in that category. I can't wait to come back though!"}
{"text":"Yikes. Really wanted to like a 24/7 2-story coffee house. Ordered a very small breakfast sandwich for about $8. Was listed as having egg, white cheddar, aioli, chives, on a buttermilk bun. It came with regular cheddar and bacon. I told a barista I think I got the wrong sandwich, as it didn't list bacon and the sandwich I received didn't have chives or white cheddar. She had me go grab a menu and show her what was wrong. Umm, okay. So she offered to remake it. Round 2 all I got was eggs on a bun. No chives, no white cheddar, no aioli. I didn't have time to wait for them to screw up a third time, so I left. I'd understand if you messed up a complicated order with a lot of customizations, but how can you not handle the standard items on your menu?"}
{"text":"Dine here if you have the patience to wait 45 minutes for your food to come out! I also found it very strange that this place has you pay before your food is brought to you. We came in as a group pretty late and two of our friends couldn't wait so long and decided to leave, food PAID because they were sick of waiting. The food was sub-par and the girls working had rude attitudes and had poor customer service. The only time the servers came to check on us was after 30 minutes when they said our food would be ready in another 10 minutes! I was excited to try this place but we left feeling unsatisfied and disappointed!"}
{"text":"We ordered only drinks here as we needed something to drink while exploring downtown. We got the cold brew with almond milk, lavender white mocha iced, and the elderflower lemonade. The cold brew and lemonade were made right after we paid, but the white mocha took forever to make. The rest of us were sitting outside and I remember going back inside looking for my sister because she hadn't come out yet. When I went inside I saw that her cup was still on the bar off to the side and we had to ask the worker about the drink, and they apologized for forgetting the drink. The drinks were okay, but for the price, I would have rather gone somewhere else, but since we were visiting Arizona for the first time we wanted to try it since the reviews were good. We didn't get any food, so maybe the food here is better than the drinks."}
{"text":"Phoenix's best kept secret! The Grand is probably the coolest coffee shop in Arizona, that I've ever been to. This place even has a hidden speakeasy on Saturday nights! Once you walk into The Grand you will see why this place is so awesome."}
{"text":"Pretty good coffee, although I've certainly had better (they use Infusion beans, which are top tier, but they lack the masterful baristas).   Meeting the \"good coffee\" criterion, the real thing that pushes them from good to 4 stars is the patio and the hours--a good coffee spot with a chill outdoor patio that's open until midnight? Not bad, not bad at all."}
{"text":"I've been to the grand about 4 times. The first time I went there I was intrigued by how different it looked than any other place I've stopped to grab a snack. I try not to write a bad reviews on places because I know sometimes days go bad. However, all four times i have came the customer service hasn't been the best. I also haven't had very good experience with their food my burger was pretty much burnt, as well as my order was forgotten. I waited while my family received their food. Might be a good place for drinks but not if you want good customer service...."}
{"text":"The grand is a good place to chill or study. Good vibe, laid back environment, and kind staff. Small parking lot that may be hard to find a spot during the night time. The onion rings and fries are always a solid pick; large quantity and always tasty. Plus there is a 10% discount for students!  So why 2 stars?   I ordered the Caprese di Pollo sandwich and it was awful. The chicken was way over-cooked and tasted like a rock/complete rubber. The bread completely fell apart the minute I picked it up. The only taste was the overpowering amount of basil. It's pretty hard to butcher a sandwich but somehow the Grand did just that. Though I'll be back for the Grand due to their nice atmosphere and good snacks, I won't be ordering any main menu items like sandwiches or burgers."}
{"text":"Love The Grand!  There is a great vibe here!  Cozy yet practical. Large tables to spread out at with chargers in the middle of the tables. The staff was friendly and the food is great. The Grand really makes the concept of coffee shop/bar work!"}
{"text":"Well a friend and I decided to check this place out last night. We went in around 8pm, but never got served. We took two seats at the bar and patiently waited for 10 minutes. A bartender dropped a beer list in front of us and then didn't speak to us again. She served everyone around us but purposely kept skipping us. We weren't really sure why. She seemed to be in a very bad mood. Ultimately we ended up leaving because she definitely wasn't going to speak to us. We were disappointed, their cocktail list looked interesting."}
{"text":"Updating my review to reflect the fact that I have been back and really enjoy Grand Central Coffee as a chill and beautiful spot to hang out and get work done. I am still hoping they get busier, but you can't find a nicer coffee shop in the downtown area.  Good coffee, great space, friendly people... Come one, come all! Fill this place up!"}
{"text":"Good coffee.  Scramble cold, very over done eggs, toast was the heal of the loaf served without butter or jam.  $1 for coffee refill."}
{"text":"Love this place. Looking forward to performing there on the 25th of this month for the first Community Alive gathering."}
{"text":"Literally spent all day here. Very interesting atmosphere, a retro steampunk wonder... you get stuck and don't want to leave! The coffee was great. The food was mostly good. I got the ham and cheese, which was yummy. I had the house mac later, big mistake. It tasted like noodles and milk, there were other yummy looking things on the menu so I won't hold that against them (i have this thing about mac and cheese... it's complicated). My friend got fish that came in naan which she loved. Anywho, I had always hoped to find an awesome place like this here in Phoenix. A bar, resto, and coffeeshop all rolled into one, complete with a not-so-hidden speakeasy and connected to a full on nightclub that goes into the wee hours. Did I mention they also have a community stage? The staff is super cool too! The GM, John, is an absolute gem! He took us up to check out the speakeasy since it was open to the public that night. Once inside we were introduced to Nicholas, the bartender. He was fabulous! Funny, friendly, and makes a damned good drink. I can't wait to go back and explore The Grand a bit more. I feel like there was still so much I missed out on."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time. The barista at the register didn't acknowledge us. Stood there for a while before we were helped by someone else. Definitely didn't feel welcomed.   Besides the service from this particular barista, the place has a cool vibe, and good coffee (caramel latte)."}
{"text":"Absolutely great place. What a great transformation from what this place used to be. The counter service is quick and efficient. Custoner service is great. The food options are good and the late night menu offerings are good too."}
{"text":"I'm 99% sure this is the best spot in town. Here's why. It's a 24/7 coffee shop, bakery, craft bar, gelato spot, and restaurant. They stop serving alcohol at 2am, sorry that part isn't 24 hours haha.  Anyways, it looks like a 1900's apothecary which is very neat! And they play live music on their patio on the weekends. On Friday nights and Saturday nights from 9pm to midnight they open up their speakeasy \"Sanctum\" which is on the second floor, just take the stairs up. It has gargoyles, red walls, and feels like a vampire's secret hideaway. It also has a nice balcony where you can enjoy the live music at The Grand from above and no one was sitting there, so I had a lot of room to myself! I also ordered the Absinthe Frappe for $9 and it was delicious!   As for parking, the free lot is small and usually quickly filled up. So I was told that you can park in the neighborhoods nearby or in the large lots across Central.  As for beer, I ordered the Rasberr Goji Rose by Wild Tonic which was like spiked floral tea, very tasty! It has Rasberry, Goji Berry, and floral notes. A must try. It was $7, so prices are reasonable.  Also, it's all ages but their speakeasy is 21+"}
{"text":"If you find yourself in downtown Phoenix, you have to check this place out! Coffee, full kitchen and bar, gelato, and open 24/7! They always have weekly specials on drinks and food and this place is SWEET on the inside! It has a hogwarts feel and is two stories with a huge outside patio so it's always easy to find a seat!"}
{"text":"Service was good! Can't complain about anything; their iced chai drink was good and so was their three tacos entree. The vibe and decor was very nice..loved how it's open 24/7 and on Easter weekend. Nice place to study, eat or just chill at."}
{"text":"Very cool place, tons of potential. Our visit today had some highs and lows. We stopped in after a visit to the public market across the street. Their brunch menu starts at 10am and you order food and drinks at the counter. There is no clear line and they probably need more people available to take orders. We got the breakfast sandwich and the BLAT sandwich, house fries, and a peanut butter cookie. I also had some cold brew coffee. The breakfast sandwich was Super yummy; seriously order it! The BLAT came out with out the fried egg, which is a critical part of the sandwich, but they were more than willing to fix it. House fries with aioli were very good. BLAT sandwich was disappointing. My peanut butter cookie was also disappointing: dry and a little overdone (brownish black on bottom). Customer service is friendly and accommodating, it just seems like they need to iron out a few kinks in how they do things in order to speed up service and make it more efficient. Atmosphere is great! Big open space, friendly people. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Literally best place ever. Whether it's spending my time here catching up with friends or doing homework it's a great place to be at. The background music is perfect and just gets you in a good mood regardless of what you are doing. The drinks are also really good, from their chamomile tea to chocolate chai to cocktails . Great atmosphere from the staff and everyone else here. Overall really amazing place!"}
{"text":"What happened Grand???? You had these comfortable chairs and awesome couches, a fireplace... Went back and all of it was gone! All that's left after hard chairs and tables..... Sucks...I hope this is temporary! But, I will say I had a great mocha here, finally."}
{"text":"Great beer! Loud staff arguing with each other when it's quiet or whatever...? Don't people in the service industry know it's kind of disrespectful? First time back here in 6 months. New staff, different vibe."}
{"text":"I was blown away by the grand. Wow! One of the coolest places in downtown Phoenix this gem has It all- food, coffee, beer. I ordered a beer. The beer menu was full of unique craft beers. The bartender was cool and let me try like 5. Ended up getting the maple porter which hit the spot. There is indoor and outdoor seating. There are people partying and people studying. I'll be back 4 sure"}
{"text":"I WANT to like this place. Location, vibe, great patio, good beer selection. but i CANNOT get past the service and general malaise of the staff. It's almost like you are disturbing the work with the inconvenience of ordering something. which SUCKS, because the food is really good! My guess is that it is a perfect millennial hang out, (which I clearly am not a member of) low ability to interact, severe entitlement, and you can stay for hours without being bothered. I dunno, given the competition for coffee shops downtown, a few minutes of training would go a long way to putting this place on my rotation. DO BETTER!!!"}
{"text":"This place looks gorgeous but our experience was super disappointing. The boy behind the counter was cold and rude and the drinks he made were weak. I got the breakfast sandwich  and the bacon was chewy and while the eggs were fluffy, they were unseasoned and boring. No water was offered even though it's over 100 degrees outside. Brioche bread was great and the atmosphere looks cool, but that's all this place has going for it. Save your money and skip this spot"}
{"text":"It would be helpful if service was provided. After sitting for 20 minutes and a slow night we got up and walked out. Nobody could be bothered apparently. Cool place...needs much better service"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of this place for just about anything! So comfortable and very personable staff. Feels like a library and a pub meshed into one."}
{"text":"We popped in for lunch after the place across the street had issues with their registers. The sparse interior is spacious and breezy. The Grand is an order at the counter place and the service is probably best described as \"hipster.\" I ordered the Buffalo cauliflower and fries. I was pretty happy with my sandwich. It was spicy and \"meaty.\" The blue cheese cut the spice well. I didn't feel like the cucumber went with the other flavors. I would have liked a side of fries, but wasn't offered any (only realizing it was an option after watching others get their food) and ended up going back up to order a huge $5 basket.  My friend got the avocado toast and a white chocolate mocha. She was a bit disappointed with the toast--the avocado was brown. The Grand seems like a good place to work and grab a light bite."}
{"text":"The Grand deserves all the stars out there, because it is just what it's name says...it's pretty darn GRAND.  I am so thankful I was introduced to this place. A 24/7 coffeeshop/eatery/outdoor patio/study atmosphere/hangout/bar place! Seriously, what can get better than that?  Ambience-   Inside: I'm the type of person who likes a little background noise while studying so this place was my ideal arena. I came here on a Sunday afternoon for a good two hours, ordered a flat white and sat at a table and peacefully studied for the GRE. There's an upstairs with more privacy and enclosed areas with lighting and smaller tables for one person. The downstairs has larger tables for group hangouts/group study.   Outside: You can sit at the large wood bench-type seating at the outside patio that is SHADED and beautifully surrounded by plants and trees! I always love to see the anomaly of greenery in AZ (although I do love the desert vibes as well). There are also small tables and chairs to sit at outside.   Food/Drinks-  The food menu is diverse ranging from burgers, mac and cheese, salads, and soup. The coffee menu is pretty unique but at the same time standard with your cold brew, latte, etc.  Alcohol Bar: They have a decent sized bar right when you walk in and I noticed on the Sunday that I was there that couples and groups of friends came in to grab a drink at the bar and leave soon after to continue day-drinking. I mentally took a note of doing that with a group of girl-friends one day, too. Great idea! ALSO, their drink menu is super fun, they have strawberry basil margaritas!? say YUM.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND: I'm excited to go back to this place at night for a night-cap, but also to study some more and order food. I think this is the perfect place for people who are hiring to take their interviewees here if you are giving more of an informal interview. You can grab either/both coffee/food/drinks and sit down in a more private table upstairs or if you need a little bit of noise, sit downstairs!   Pics on Instagram: @deeps.eats"}
{"text":"First time visiting - fantastic setup and cool vibes. The brownies are delicious and the bartendista Bernadette makes a really good latte. I was also lucky enough to meet The Tanner from Grand Central on my first visit. All members of the staff are welcoming and extremely personable. I would recommend Grand Central to anyone looking for a cool coffee spot downtown."}
{"text":"There are two things which Downtown Phoenix arguably has too much of.  Pizza and coffee.  There's a restaurant serving pizza around every corner and there's a coffee house around every corner (remarkably, not one of which is a Starbucks).  Let's face it, we all know pizza has no ceiling in America.  But increasingly it seems like the corner coffee house doesn't either.  To be fair, there's plenty about The Grand that differs from the numerous coffee houses in Downtown.  In fact much of what you find here is radically different.  I actually came here to meet up with a local organization for a Facebook event, but took a little time to peruse as this was my first visit.  The Grand occupies one space in what (until recently) was a row of nightclubs along Central Avenue just south of McKinley.  Amsterdam nightclub occupied this space for years with a couple of other nightclubs next door (both of which are still open).  Now this space is Downtown's newest 24/7/365 coffee house.  With relatively few 24/7 businesses Downtown, this is a welcome sight.  The space is enormous (at least 10,000 square feet) including a sizable outdoor patio on the north side of the building.  The Amsterdam space could pack in hundreds and so The Grand can at times feel pretty cavernous with a lot of unutilized or underutilized spaces.  According to the owners the inspiration behind the interior was that of Grand Central Station, with various time pieces and a menu board substituting for a train schedule.  That qualifies as different I'd say.  Up until recently the menu was pretty limited to coffee, booze, and baked goods.  Of late they've been slowly rolling out an all day food menu covering breakfast foods all the way through late night munchies.  I will say however that they're still a little disorganized on the food front.  Between the food menu, coffee menu, baked goods, and booze list, I feel like The Grand probably should change their business model to that of a full scale restaurant rather than a coffee house.  When I got in line up front to order my food, there was no menu to look at other than the one (and only) menu at the register.  There was a couple of folks in front of me and each (understandably) took well over a minute to look through everything and put down their order.  For a place as large as The Grand, it would be wise of them to instead just have hostesses find them a table and use waiters and waitresses to take people's orders.  Hob Nobs has struggled with a similar problem and it was partly responsible for a bad experience I had there.  After looking over the full menu, I went with their house made burger named (appropriately enough) The Grand Burger.  Also got a glass of New Belgium Blue Paddle Pils.  Total cost including tax came to $15.  The specs on the burger: ground short rib, white cheddar, a bacon-shallot gastrique, arugula, garlic aioli, and tomato with a brioche bun.  I was a big fan of the gastrique and the bun was toasted perfectly.  Tasty burger, though for $10 I was kind of disappointed it didn't come with a side.  At this juncture it seems like they're still feeling out the food phase of this place.  They're completely good to go as far as their coffee and the booze selection at the bar is pretty impressive (including more than 20 beers on tap, a dozen wines by the glass, and a fair number of cocktails to choose from).  But as I mentioned earlier it seems now as though The Grand is a full scale restaurant masquerading as a coffee house.  I get wanting to maintain that coffee house feel, but there's nothing wrong with just being a good go-to 24/7 restaurant.  With time, hopefully they'll get the logistics fine tuned.  I'll give The Grand credit for taking a big gamble with a 24/7 business that seems truly unafraid to take risks with their food and drink menu.  I hope the gamble pays off."}
{"text":"This place has the worst possible service ever!  Food was marginal at best. I can't understand the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Found this place this morning when out for a morning walk while in town for a conference. Absolutely loved it! First of all it was the only coffee shop open before 7am - why no one in Phoenix needs coffee before 7am on a Monday I don't know.   We had amazing breakfast sandwiches, the aioli made it. Great lattes and tea selection. Didn't try it but completely intrigued by their Fruitty Pebbles latte."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and this place is always busy, which is a great thing but this time I was very very disappointed. I waited over 40 minutes for just the regular Mac & Cheese. When I finally asked the staff when mine would be ready they said \"it's right over there, I'll bring it to you\".... so when I finally got my food, it was luke warm at best AND some of the noodles were either over cooked or not cooked?? I couldn't tell which one other than they were crunchy. So I'm going to assume not cooked properly.   The only reason I sucked it up and ate what I could without complaining to the staff was it was Friday and it appears there were only two floor staff... TWO. That is absolutely ridiculous for a Friday and a day where most people have it off to observe Veterans Day. I felt bad complaining when I could see that they were doing what they could with the limited help that they had. Shame on management for not staffing more people and shame on the kitchen staff for serving undercooked noodles...won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I definitely love the atmosphere, excellent drink choices and now food. If it were permissible I pretty sure I would live here. By far my favorite place to get specialized beverages. Their Scotch and Cigars cocktail is exquisite. Seating it plentiful, my only one complaint is ever since the opening of the kitchen it has become a little too hot to sit inside during the summer."}
{"text":"How does this only have four stars? It's a little pricey perhaps but hands down the best coffee shop I have been to in any city. Friendly service, tasty coffee, super fast wifi, hearty food, and the most amazing scenery/sitting spaces. I'm thinking about moving in."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place and thankful that I stopped in to give it a try before an evening at the Phoenix Symphony. I love the atmosphere. I had only been to Amsterdam a few times and this is definitely more my style. I tried the Roasted Fries and Mac & Cheese - absolutely delicious. I had a tasty cup of coffee to go along with my meal. Overall, a great meal/snack to hold me over.  I look forward to return when I have more time and with my Partner. Great service! This is such a great addition to downtown Phoenix. Cheers***"}
{"text":"Wonderful cafe and bar! Very eclectic vibe yet completely relaxed for studying or hanging out with friends. The outdoor and second story seating are very appreciated. My go-to is the lavender latte - it's refreshingly delightful."}
{"text":"Wow - such a cool new place in downtown Phoenix!  We stopped in last weekend for a drink and really enjoyed ourselves - great atmosphere and decor, friendly bartenders and a nice drink menu.  I enjoyed an organic cider that I had never tried before - bonus!  They told me about another cider that was on target to go on tap next and it sounded delicious too.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Plenty of seating and very interesting decorations. I went mid-day looking for a place to study quietly, and that was exactly what I got. Being the tea-girl that I am, there was a moderate list to choose from and the iced rose tea I chose was delicious. The only reason I didn't give a 5/5 rating might have been partly because of me, but I had to drive around the block a couple of times to find the entrance on the other side of the light rail. However, once I found it there was a good amount of parking and I continued to enjoy the rest of my afternoon."}
{"text":"Just tried this place out for the first time today. Had breakfast and coffee... it was great, the team working there was amazing. They have a full bar inside and also serve all meals. I had no idea this was all inside but I am in love with it. Can't wait to visit them again!"}
{"text":"This is going to be the worst review I've ever written. I've been coming to this cafe now for over a month at least 3 times a week. Over the course of the past 2 weeks I've had to wait over 5 min or so for someone to take my order let alone acknowledge me. There's only really 2 people there that actually remember me which is sad. Seeing that their never really that busy when I'm there. So today as I sit in my normal spot without even have ordered. I watch from a distance as the only girl serving people is still engaged in a conversation that has lasted over 10 min. That's 15 min. That I a paying customer still hasn't been acknowledged. Not only is she not aware of her surroundings she's taken the liberty to use a cooler as a chair at the window bar. If I was the owner of this establishment I would fire her on that accord alone. I don't pay you to sit! Lol..it also seems like if I was to border alcohol I would get immediate service. Seeing that's the only clientele she's engaging with. So as I walk out now unserved to another business that's willing to except my hard earned cash. I challenge Charlie the owner to rectify the situation or I will assume that my business or anyone else that cares business is not needed for your establishment...it suxks because I really do like this place too..  Signed Chef..."}
{"text":"So you don't have to be Einstein to figure out that you order food up at the bar\counter,  they give you a number and bring it to your table. So don't go in and sit down then get mad when no one shows up to wait on you and smear them all over Yelp. Sheesh. Went in after 8 on a First Friday, they had what seemed a limited menu so I ordered a chicken Caprese sandwich. It was well built and tasty. Not excited that fries or a side are not included. I ordered the fries, and they weren't ideal. Soggy.  Love the decor and the large space, a variety of areas to sit to fit every mood: the bar, patio, sidewalk, quiet table, etc. I think that's what really makes the place, plus the fact it's open 24/7! Noticed the fryer really stinks up the place though, after sitting inside and eating, our clothes smelled like old fry oil.  Maybe we were just too close to the open kitchen this night. Don't worry, we'll be back to check it out again."}
{"text":"I absolutely fell in love with this place. Back in the day I would come to this place when it was called Amsterdam's they had a piano in the day and at night dance music.. it catered to the gay community but very gay friendly  :-)"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of Grand. Friendly. Laid back staff. Love going here.  Without a doubt the best 24hr cafe in town."}
{"text":"I like to try new places around phoenix so I decided to come here today. I was promptly greeted by Bernadette and she was so friendly. I wanted to start with a coffee and then the pastries were just looking at me so I got one of those too and she quickly offered to heat it up which honestly made it so amazing. The coffee was fantastic and I got to finish my reading so maybe to reward myself I would grab a cocktail. This place was cool and had their own delicious signature cocktails! It was made to perfection. I'm going to definitely be coming back here and bring friends the place has such a cool environment! Thank you again Bernadette!!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is very spacious!! There are so many different places to choose from -- from rustic chairs, to comfy sofas. You can lounge inside on the ground level, or upstairs, or you can choose to sit outside on the balcony, or outside under fairy lights. Either way, the views are spectacular and are lovely to take in. A couple of people were lying down on couches and others were studying and doing homework, while others were chatting. It is a chilled vibe, and I  really enjoyed the atmosphere. (So much so that I spent 4 hours with my friends here!)  The coffee itself is more expensive than Starbucks, and is not nearly as strong, but the drinks are good. I had a Caramel Latte and it was sweet enough to be enjoyable without feeling like I was going to get diabetes. My friends had a cold brew (which was not as strong as they would have preferred, but still good) and a Mocha Latte (which was good but tasted more like chocolate than coffee). The only complaint we had was that there was a ridiculous amount of ice used."}
{"text":"My fiance and i went in late around 1am for his birthday dinner, the staff was so nice and the food was delicious. Definately going back..."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great spot to stop for an awesome coffee or tea in the mornings and a fun place at night for drinks. The atmosphere is awesome, super grand (haha) decor, kind of a dark, old timey vibe.   They always have an awesome selection of beers, the mix drinks are super tasty, and they also have a lot of cool things going on with their non alcoholic drinks. The lavender white mocha is delish and I love love loved the rose lemonade, tho it can be a bit too sweet for my taste depending on who's making it.   4 stars rather than 5 because I've come here several times to do some studying and their WiFi never works for me. I guess some people have no trouble but for some reason I'm never able to connect, when I asked they said that just happens for some people and oh well basically."}
{"text":"Somehow this spot succeeds in bringing together steampunk cafe and jungle patio into an awesome outcome and a welcoming spot. Plan to be back very soon for another delicious matcha latte, or a French 75 (a cocktail that should be on every menu of any self-respecting speakeasy)."}
{"text":"My newest Downtown Phoenix love. From the outdoor patio to the beautiful interior to the diverse menu and coffee drinks, The Grand offers me everything I would want from a casual study/lunch/dinner/hangout spot. The menu might seem a little pricey for what The Grand offers, but let me assure you:  the portion sizes make it worth the $$. I ordered $3 french fries and felt like I had fries for days. Also the staff has been so good to me. I would continue coming back just to interact with the friendly baristas and wait staff.   What really makes The Grand my favorite place though is the upstairs study lounge. The tables are wonderfully equipped with plenty of outlets and desk lamps, comfortable seating and your food is delivered right to your work space. How can it get any better? Where there is reliable wifi, plenty of coffee, and the ease of ordering a full meal, that is definitely an ideal workspace for me. Did I mention The Grand is 24 hours? I really wouldn't mind pulling an all-nighter here.   Some downfalls would be the weekend brunch menu ~ that is all they will serve during the weekends, so don't expect to get your favorite sandwich and fries combo on a Sunday. Also parking can be a hassle, but they do have their own parking lot!! It just fills up fast if you come on a busy day, keep this in mind!!  Great place, great location. Way to win my heart, The Grand."}
{"text":"What a gem. 24/7 coffee shop, bakery, craft bar, and restaurant.  Great place to work, study or just hang out. There's a good amount of outlets all over the place for your electronics. WIFI is pretty quick too.  Eclectic atmosphere - artsy train station with an industrial vibe."}
{"text":"This is a great spot in CenPhoen. The bartender displayed manic tendencies. And I quote \"I'm just dramatic tonight\". There may have been some murders here, but overall but a great spot. Free shots on your birthday. They hate people from Ohio, but Ohio is a pretty miserable place to begin with so I can't argue. Botton line, good beer good coffee, and a dece vibe. And please don't fire the bartender because of this review."}
{"text":"Great space and friendly staff.....no problem with the drinks (usually), but I never seem to have luck with any of the pastry they sell.......it always seems to be stale!!   They would be able to build a better business if they disposed or donated the pastry at the end of the day and start over with fresh pastry the next morning.  I think the cupcake I had today had to have been 3-4 days old.......dry and disgusting!"}
{"text":"Late night on a Saturday. Oh, it's actually early morning. It's 1 in the AM to be exactly. I got a Moscow mule and a cauliflower burger. For some reason, they don't taste as great at this hour. But it's great to have this place at this hour. This 24-hour concept might work. It's not NYC but it can be someday."}
{"text":"Girl bartender with tattoos and big feather eyelashes kicked me out in 100 degree weather today. Btw did purchase tea from there. No manager in site I'm a regular there and always get the worst attitude and service during the day. Night people get 5 stars honestly they are the best! Btw I made a yelp just to post this"}
{"text":"So... today I came for a breakfast sandwich. I've had them several times before. They are on a luxurious bun, with unusually fluffy and voluminous eggs. There are chives & aioli oozing out, along with thick, succulent bacon. I've brought people here specifically for this sandwich.  Today, I ordered it and it seems the price has increased from $6.50 to $7.50.  My complaint is that what I received to eat was a mere shadow of what it's been in the past. I'm attaching a picture of what I got, in a 3-pic collage, featuring what I've had in the past. The other pics are from other Yelpers and are representative of what I thought I was getting.  - The bun was... of no consequence. It was different than before and also just sort of... bland. It made no statement. It was like a bowl of milkless Cheerios... not horrible, but also not generally desirable.  - The bun was also overly-buttered and I dunno... uhm... freakin' flattened! Like it was sat on by a large man wearing over-stuffed Kirkland Signature jeans from 2005.   - The eggs were smaller than the # of men in Hollywood who have NOT been charged with harassment, or worse...  - The chive content was... zero (there is a chance that I am a p.o.s. and the whole sandwich got \"redesigned\" and this was all printed on some new menu, but maybe???)  - Overall... this sandwich was so unappealing, coupled with a modest increase in price, that I can't in good faith ever recommend it again. I'm HOPING it was a new cook... I mean, the look, feel & flavor profile was so, so, so far off the mark and so completely different than what it's been each & every time in the past (verify this sandwiches glorious history by scrolling through other people's Yelp pics of it!!), that I'm boggled. I'm more confused than when Trump met with the governor of American Samoa and reported back that the meeting with their \"president\" went well. (True story!)  So... COOL spot. Great ambiance. Love the 24-hours-ness. Still will come and have more coffee and food. Also, I'll gleefully update this review when I try another b-fast sandwich (gotta give it another try; can't let a \"fluke\" taint how I feel). BUT if it's another clone of today's sandwich, then I'll need to tap-out and recommend others do to... at least on this sandwich.  SOLUTION: keep the sandwich awesome, and raise the price if you need to. Or, allow the sandwich to be dialed down in awesomeness, BUT drop the price by a buck. However, downgrading to an uninspired, warm fail-wich AND increasing the price, in my opinion, is the opposite of awesomeness. My 2¢."}
{"text":"What a unique venue! I may have visited Amsterdam in the past which is what this coffee shop used to be, but regardless, the atmosphere is a trip! I love the steam punk-train station vibe going on here (as another reviewer described). I agree with that description!   I was hesitant to review because I didn't actually have coffee here. I had a Smoke and Cigars cocktail. Don't judge me since I had this on a Monday night but holidays are rough!! It kicked my butt! It was probably one of the strongest scotch drinks I've ever imbibed. I'm fairly certain if I had been fighting a cold the alcohol in it would've surely killed those germs. I'm thinking next time of sticking to an Old Fashioned, my usual.   Back to the atmosphere, there are 2 stories of areas to sit and enjoy coffee, or a cocktail in my case! There is a large outdoor area too so this place is great for large groups. I guess several literary groups meet here once a week or so!   Parking is on the north side but you have to come from south to get to the parking area and stay in the super left lane on the left side of the tram tracks to get there so it is slightly confusing, but at least the parking area is free once you do find it. One way streets make coming here a little more adventurous."}
{"text":"I'm happy. I went to Grand Central in Phoenix tonight, because I'm a night owl and Yelp says they're open 'til midnight. It's now 12:40am. They're not showing any signs of trying to get us to leave -- music's still on, dates are still gazing into each others' eyes, barristas are still buzzing around at the bar, lights are still low. I don't know what's going on, but I'm staying.  Also, the curry cauliflower is luscious. Very much enjoyed."}
{"text":"Excellent range of craft beer on tap! Super cool atmosphere! Once kitchen is up and running will be a great new downtown spot!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent stop in downtown Phoenix. Every server we met was chipper. The menu has a lot of variety and includes dishes with interesting add ins, like matcha in the waffles. We came at 11 am on a Sunday and had no wait for brunch. The lattes were tremendously excellent. Between us all, we tried the matcha waffles, the avocado toast, and biscuits and gravy. All dishes were top notch. The place has great ambiance, too, and is excellent for a family."}
{"text":"I just want to say how impressed I was with this place. Loved the unique and nostalgic decor and just want to say how friendly and polite the barista was. I noted a prior posting someone had commented on poor service and the owner took it upon himself to make changes. Congrats to the owner and staff for understanding the importance of good customer service and that teamwork will bring in more happy customers and then it becomes a win-win situation for all"}
{"text":"coffee was good but im most impressed by the fact that my cup stayed put in my cup holder despite crashing my car. overall would rate this place a 5/5"}
{"text":"I hesitate to even give this place a single star. We tried to sit outside and they told us they only serve inside. We sat inside for 10 minutes and eventually realized we had to go to a counter to order. When we went to the counter the woman there literally had no idea what was in any sort of dish, even the side salad. She couldn't give recommendations and ordering took literally 15 minutes because any simple question we had she couldn't answer. The service here was extremely subpar. We were the only group of 3 orders in the restaurant and it took 20 minutes to deliver very subpar food. I will never come back here.... or if I'm forced to again I will not order due to the horrendous service and wait time."}
{"text":"Very cool spot you have to check it out.  I will come back for certain.  A plus service and unique atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hats off to Zoey! She found a bag I'd left at The Grand and put it in safekeeping for me as I rushed back from Flagstaff when I discovered my mistake. FYI we had breakfast at The Grand in Phoenix and arrived in Flagstaff that evening. I called the restaurant when I discovered it was gone and miraculously my bag was STILL by the table we used!!  I'm still in shock that it was there! And it was filled with a computer and privacy sensitive items. By the way, our breakfast was fabulous!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is on point and the coffee is great! Can't wait till they have their full menu up and running!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is quaint, cozy and and a great place to study. I love all the different retro furniture and the vibe. Definitely have great food, coffee has been better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Spacious with lots of couches, tables and good wifi. Excellent matcha green tea lattes too!   Cool space and nice character with really good service. The only downfall? On Friday nights it can get busy so the private lot will fill up...had to circle a few times before a spot opened up."}
{"text":"Beautiful inside and outside with a very relaxing patio, but it's clear that's where all the money went. Food was barely decent: I had the BLAT and the egg white was runny (undercooked) while the rest of the sandwich was just so-so.  My mom's scramble lacked flavor or character. The self-serve water was clearly from the tap and tasted moldy. Coffee was not anything special, which is immediately a bad thing for a coffee house. Overall, an average person could have cooked a better meal given the ingredients available. Service was lackluster in a disaffected hipster way.  The patio was in need of sweeping and table wiping (there was a cigarette butt on the table and another one under a separate table as well as other bits of trash, for example).  I would totally eat out on their patio again, if I could bring my own food and drinks and a rag to wipe off the table beforehand and didn't need anything from the staff."}
{"text":"You know a place is great when they serve you a proper rare burger (If you ask for a rare burger, which I did) the only hitch is, it takes SO LONG for you to get any food or drinks. If you're willing to spend a LOT of time waiting and chatting with your friends then this place is great, but if you're hungry and you need food and drinks ASAP this is NOT the place for you. I hope service gets better because that burger was so great. If I have a ton of time on my hands I wouldn't mind waiting for it again."}
{"text":"Love this place. I love that it's open 24 hours and their food is decent and they have a lot of selection for alcohol and coffee. It's awesome for writing."}
{"text":"I've been to most of the cafes in the Phoenix downtown area, and this place has got to be one of the best in town! The vibe is very old-town with a hint of industrial decor. This place doesn't have very much lighting, but the atmosphere in general is very relaxed and great for chilling our or studying (on a computer). It's even open 24 hours! I'll definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of all the books I used to read as a kid, except this time I'm actually in them while still being served great coffee, great food, and an awesome playlist. As a college student I'm definitely coming back, not just because it's 24/7, but because they offer a discount. After my second visit, it's become my favorite place, I hope anyone reading this gives them a try as well."}
{"text":"Perfect place to study or work. Friendly team, good coffee and food, open 24hrs, tons of room. Whether you're writing a paper or coding your next masterpiece, this is the spot. If the parking lot is full, there's usually spots open across the street. Meters are free after 8pm."}
{"text":"Awesome setup for a coffee spot also great for studying, good vibe and coffees are good. Service was also really good didn't have a chance to try any of the beers or spirits but so far it was a great experience during my visit to AZ."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, lousy coffee. Decaf was lukewarm/almost cold and tasted like instant. Latte was lukewarm as well. We both had the overnight oats and it was okay but a gut bomb."}
{"text":"Really disappointed, was down at the March Madness, found This little gem of a place to relax, at 6:30 pm has a great menu , the place was not half full, went up to the counter to place our order to sit on their great looking patio! The girl tells us she is sorry they aren't taking anymore orders for the night there's only 1 chef working and he is backed up???? What? Are you kidding me? We just laughed, would of loved too try a new place a 4 star atmosphere 0 star for customer service an unable to rate food Boo!"}
{"text":"Design, decor and feel are excellent...Cold brew is not.  Bitter and tastes like it needs more time."}
{"text":"How does this place have only 3 and a half stars? Crazy good food, open all day, great ambience, what's not to like??  My girlfriend and I went here for the first time the other day and both ordered the Grand Burger cooked medium. They came out undercooked; it's all good, it happens. I hate having to bring food back, but Tori and Robby gave excellent customer service and got us some new burgers which were amazing. It was their welcoming and sincere attitude that really made all the difference in the world.   Also, the inside of this place is so cool! It has an upper speakeasy area up a staircase, and an outdoor area with a water fountain and a stage for live music. Such an awesome place. We will be coming here often."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. Decent happy hour deals for $5 drafts and wine but when they billed us we did not have the happy hour deal included. After 20 minutes they finally fixed it and were not very friendly about it. Food was ok but nothing special for the price. Overall we probably won't go back."}
{"text":"No...just no. S L O W service! Seriously, over a 10 minuit wait for drip coffee. Then...they tried to give me used cream they served to another customer! Even with those big ass 80's glasses nobody working there could see their place sucked. I threw my coffee in the garbage and left. Would rather go to Circle K!"}
{"text":"This is a very cute and urban place to hang out, grab a quick coffee or lunch, and study. My roommate told me about it and my boyfriend and I went to study there and we love it. It's a very good place to go when you don't want to stay on campus to do work. We used to go to Starbucks as well but it's always so cold and a lot of people got here and there's limited outlets and this place is sort of made for studying and such. I completely love it! The prices are a little crazy, but the food is pretty good"}
{"text":"I love The Grand! The coffee/tea drinks are delicious, and so is the food. The cost of food is totally reasonable for the amount of food you get. I've had both the regular mac & cheese and mac of the moment. The buffalo cauliflower is HUGE, and so good!   The best part of this place is probably the atmosphere. It definitely has the vintage train station vibe that it is named for, but it also has this magical, Hogwarts-like feel.   I haven't been here for boozy drinks yet, but it is certainly on my list to stop in next time I'm out at night downtown."}
{"text":"It's always a great time at the grand! Excellent food as well as excellent drinks, all the staff is super friendly but both Zoe and Cierra go above and beyond and always make the night the best it could be. They are the reason we keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I only tried a soy chai tea. It was more than generous fill for the cup. It's sweetness is perfect, not too much and not too little. I did not like it tho since it smelled liked a cough syrup. I did not like how loud the music is since I went there for studying. Even though I wore a Bluetooth earbuds, but still heard the noise. Around 3, it was the time that kids got out of school and there was more noise beside the music. I couldn't finish my project and had to change the place.   The decorations and the sittings are varied and an all comfortable levels. The restrooms are nice and clean. There are a parking lot behind the location and meter ones around it."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, food was on par for 24 hour restaurant, and they're dog friendly! Only complaint is the type of music being played. Felt like being in a club rather than a coffee shop, but many other people around us managed to be productive on their laptops despite the ambiance."}
{"text":"A friend and I were going to try this place out for breakfast this morning. We stopped in and didn't make it past the main bar as the barista/bartender was incredibly rude. Having never been in before we had a couple questions about if the place was open seating, where the menu was at, etc. the employee acted like he couldn't be bothered even though he was not doing anything at the time since it was fairly quite with little crowd there.   Complete turnoff when you go to a new place trying to give them hard earned money and a staff member acts like they could give a damn.   I will probably go back eventually as the space and menu looked ideal, however not for a bit."}
{"text":"Looked forward to coming with the the exciting write up and good reviews I saw here earlier.. I had a cold brew and a cappucino, both were terrible. The barista seems inexperienced, even checking with us if it was a small or medium cup that he was holding (?!)   I definitely wouldn't be coming back again, their coffee is terrible, especially for a coffee company!"}
{"text":"Hey-o rebuttal review any one? This'll probably be one of my first \"serious reviews\" so I'm making it a plan to counter a bad review to compensate for lack of Jest. (Guess which one?) LET'S GO! Just left Grand. As always, the baristas are great, the service is prompt and the employees never hesitate to check on how things are going. Ordered myself the usual (never disappointing) iced chai along side (you guessed it) AVOCADO TOAST.  The zest to the avocado was tasty and felt like a real pallet cleanser. Couldn't find it in myself to complain about rising avocado prices, being as though that's an actual issue, especially for businesses like the grand. Everyone's gotta profit. I don't mind. I just want the cado. Didn't bring my kid (mostly because I'm 19 and don't own one) but even if I did own a child, I'd make it a point to teach it how to drink water without making a mess AMIRITE LADIES? Any-who, sat at the big round table upstairs. It's great for students like myself, equipped with charging ports for laptop and phone! It IS Pretty wobbly but I'm more of a problem solver and just pulled the ol \"righty tighty\" on it and adjusted the wobble. I'd like to point out that Grand does an amazing job of being versatile and diverse enough to serve all walks of life. They seem to be opening up a cool new portion downstairs for sorbet, have an upstairs for studying and the outside seating is amazing scene for a night at the bar. (Or I'd assume. What do I know? I'm 19) If diversity isn't enough to sway you on over, take note that Grand continues to be one of the largest/ more spacious coffee/bar joints I've been to in the metro area. That goes a long way with me. :) thanks Grand, for the kick ass service and the kick ass Cado.   Xoxo- Aysia (I miss us. Call me some time?)"}
{"text":"Always open, serves coffee, adult dranx, and serves munchies? Coconut beer, antique decor, a sick patio.... Cheers y'all"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this morning and absolutely loved it, ever since Jobot moved and cut their hours I have been on the search for a  new 24/7 coffee joint for those late night cravings and im shocked I didn't find this place sooner! The ambiance is nice at 3am but just judging from the sheer amount of seating I can't imagine I would ever want to come here around busy times, just like lux I imagine it gets quite crowded so do yourself a favor and come at an odd hour, enjoy the weirdness of being one of the few people out in the world and have a cup of joe in peace only a 24/7 coffee house can bring. Oh and, breakfast all day, every day."}
{"text":"Quick drop in for a cap. Great decor but vibe a bit dark for my early morning kickoff. Cap was good!"}
{"text":"This place has quickly become one of my favorite study spots. The staff is great and incredibly accommodating. There's a world of couches and tables available for seating Wong with beautiful outdoor patios as well. While you sometimes have to search for an available outlet, the large space allows for intimacy amongst a sea of people (if you're there when it's busy). The coffee is pretty good and the pastries look delicious. I highly recommend this place for all students.   Just map quest it first so you can find the free parking."}
{"text":"Great spot for just about anything! Study session, Sunday brunch, late late night bite/night cap. Ruben was so peachy and lovely! Glad Phoenix is bringing this type of vibe to the city."}
{"text":"I have never had to wait 20 minutes for an americano before. It's just espresso and water?! How long does that take?! Amazing. If you don't have 20 minutes to wait for 1 drink, avoid this place at all costs. Also it wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Interesting decor. The iced dirty chai tea latte tasted great and helped me survive the long day. The avocado toasts were huge portion (=good price)."}
{"text":"New favorite coffee shop alert.  Good tea/coffee Friendly staff Will be open 24/7 Opening full kitchen Serves wine/beer Spacious indoor and outdoor areas ASU student discount  Great atmosphere   Grand Central is relatively new to the Roosevelt Row and has its work cut out for it since there are many shops in the area. However, Grand Central offers a better experience in my opinion. Coffee shops can be cramped or crowded but this is not the case with this new gem. There is are upstairs/downstairs/patio areas and a decent sized bar.   The decor is modeled after (you guessed it) an old school train station. The owner has obviously dedicated a lot of time, money, and effort to convert this space. Stop by and check it for yourself.   Getting to it can be tricky since it is positioned on the west side of Central. Be sure to be in the furtherest left lane on Central to get to it or you'll be blocked by the lightrail. Don't let the extra maneuvering stop you from visiting!"}
{"text":"Came in at 2:30AM, told me that the kitchen is closed. Not truly 24/7 is it? I dont recomend this sad excuse of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent. Excellent. Excellent.  Not like we need another coffee shop in the hood, but this maybe our nicest/best yet!   The place used to be a nightclub and now it's a beautiful HUGE coffee shop with hard liquor and wine, and plenty of couches and tables (two levels!!)  I had a caramel Latte and it was Excellent. Excellent. Excellent.  And they have beautiful outdoor patio and parking on the north side of the building. Just awesome!"}
{"text":"Great setting and pretty decent espresso. Would recommend they serve with sparkling water given the type of establishment and quality of bean."}
{"text":"this place has a great atmosphere, location and vibe. i truly love the feel inside and the patio areas (when it cools down). excellent architectural and interior design. the happy hour time slot is great. great beer.  i originally gave 3 stars but i am now changing to 5 stars.  original -i visited at 8:00pm and wanted a decaf coffee. they do not have decaf! grand central coffee is a coffee house. it is located in the usa not argentina. why no decaf?  revised - i returned, with my lady, for happy hour 2 days later and was greeted by charlie, general manager. super friendly and inviting. he asked if this was our first time in. the opportunity arose for me to explain about the decaf. without even skipping a beat, he said decaf would available tuesday morning. wow!!!!!  original - the choice of scotch is limited to two. revised - soooo, i told charlie about the choice of scotch. turns out there are several dance rooms each with their own large bar. he took us for a guided tour and there are many choices to pick from. wow!!!  my lady was thrilled to see all the dance rooms and simply asked if they had a disco night. charlie responded by saying that was great idea and would plan one!!! wow!!!  original - no food other then pastries. yes, i was told the kitchen is 6 weeks from opening.  revised - well, it is 3 weeks out not 6.   original - the staff was not that welcoming. i felt they were not happy with their jobs. no smiles. revised - charlie had others complain and the staff have been replaced.   ok, the first visit did not \"wow\" me. i am so glad i returned. especially running across charlie. and, the new bar tender robert was extremely friendly and accommodating.  ok........i have been \"wowed\"  i now hear the call to return."}
{"text":"Nice spot to chill but they kept running out of everything. Saturday they were out of stuff to make paella and Sunday they ran out of chorizo and couldn't give me a lemon in my water because they were running low    When I did get chorizo it was super tasty with the biscuit and gravy. The hibiscus drink was also strong and delicious (totally recommend). Night time playlist was also the bomb.... place kind of picks up at night."}
{"text":"Have been here a number of times and was always pretty happy. On 4/23 around 1130, went in it was very slow but the girl working the register and the female bartender were both really rude, like they were annoyed that we even came in. Tried ordering a beer but somehow they were \"out\" of the first 4 beers i tried to order. Hopefully things improve."}
{"text":"Eclectic atmosphere and DJ for Sunday brunch is a can't miss. Handmade drinks, fast service, and gorgeous outside seating make this a must hit weekend venue."}
{"text":"Okay. So first off the we have a coffee shop downtown with an amazing floor plan of space and seating. Open till midnight during the week, weekends they go untill 2am they have amazing coffee not to mention a full bar with over 23 amazing beers on draft! Honestly please come check them out located in the heart of downtown with a awesome atmosphere and good vibes. Cheers"}
{"text":"Cool new spot in DTPHX! They're still getting up and going, but the atmosphere and service is already great!"}
{"text":"Man I don't know how I missed adding my review when we came a while back, but here goes., I was so excited to check this place out! I am a lover of my coffee and to hear this place was open 24 hours I was so excited! I was definitely impressed the second my eyes came upon such a grand entrance. Pun intended. Beautiful gates, waterfall and outdoor seating. Once inside yet again I was impressed. So much to see that my eyes didn't know where to check out first. Even the water that sits free for anyone needing to hydrate was beautiful. That however is where everything went downhill. I ordered a few different coffees both hot and iced, a tea, a banana bread , and two boxes waters. The iced coffee was bland, the hot coffee wasn't very hot, and the bread was hard as a rock. I was bummed. Service was just as bad. The employees were more interested in each other than helping take our order. The place was  pretty empty as is was early in the morning so that was sad. I even came back a second time to see if my experience would be any better and I was yet again hit with coffee that was just plain awful. Bummer."}
{"text":"Awesome place for the neighborhood.  Always nice when you can get a coffee or a beer or wine.  Great beer on tap. Friendly staff.  Remodel they did looks great.  Love the vibe."}
{"text":"Very cool spot! Love the atmosphere and that there is a full bar in addition to the coffee bar. Can't wait to take my dogs to their enormous patio when it gets cooler out!"}
{"text":"Totally a hidden gem down town that I'm almost hesitant to tell everybody about because I LOVE having this be like my own secret place of amazingness! If you believe in magic and are a non-muggle, then you'll love this place because it's a renovated train station that used to offer direct connection to Hogwarts. If you love history, then you'll love this place because almost every piece of furniture and decor in this place has a story waiting to be told. If you're a hipster or a college kid or an aspiring writer or a business person then you'll love this place because it's got a great vibe and atmosphere coupled with tons of little nooks and areas that are great for you to work at. They've got coffee, tea, and pastries to help you start your day or carry you through the afternoon, and then they've got a full bar and beers on tap to help you celebrate having made it through the day. The outdoor area is gorgeous, and I totally love the fountain that they have out there, and then for the ONE COLD DAY in Phoenix a year, they've got plenty of heaters outside to keep you warm. It's only a matter of time before this becomes the next \"in\" thing in Phoenix. I come here all of the time to work on a book that I'm writing and to enjoy a pastry and some chai tea. DEFINITELY check this place out- I'm sure you'll love it!"}
{"text":"They clearly do not understand their menu. Came here for brunch ordered scotch coffee and breakfast sandwhich...coffee came with out the Bailey's that it clearly had on the menu..sandwich came without chives In eggs and out way before my husband's meal...clearly catering to the hipsters who only want to drink and stare at their Apple computer...good luck!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located near the light rail, this coffee house is open 24 hours which is perfect for those night owls who study at ASU.  My friend Clint and I decided to come here after the free day at PHX Art Museum. I love the vibe here much better than the old gay bar that used to occupy this place. Great lavender teas, and fantastic servers. They do have a small but well-executed selection of food, and yes they do have libations. I love that it's next door to a live band venue so that you can hear the musicians play at night. Good luck finding parking space here though, but the positive is it's very close to the light rail."}
{"text":"We came in last Saturday with a large group for my husband's bday and had a great experience. We sat at a large table and ordered our drinks from the bar. The bartendress was very helpful and friendly. Some of our guests ordered avocado fries, which were awesome! Others ordered fries, which were also tasty. I look forward to coming back for more drinks and food in a future visit."}
{"text":"A top shelf coffee house. The decor is incredible. Like an old train station with lots of antique light fixtures and furniture. Solid menu and excellent coffee. Would have been a higher review if service was better. Took forever to get our coffee. Barista was not very friendly. Coffee came out like warm. Work on that peeps because your place is really beautiful."}
{"text":"I've been to The Grand on a few occasions and everytime it's been a great experience. It's a fantastic environment if you're looking for a place to park and get some work accomplished. It's also a perfect spot to have some bites and be social. The drinks are reasonably priced as is the food. I highly recommend their \"Grand Burger\". The avacado fries are also good, however be prepared as they have a little heat to them.  The staff is extremely friendly and inviting. In particular the bartender, Zoey, was helpful in providing menu suggestions that matched my tastes.  She also makes a really great Moscow Mule.  If you're looking for a place that has a lot to offer The Grand exceeds that endeavor. Outdoor seating, indoor lounging, great coffee, full bar, delicious menu, chill vibe, awesome staff. I love coming downtown for the soul purpose of visiting this business. They're open 24 hours now as well so you can literally check this place out anytime. 5/5"}
{"text":"The Grand is a nice, elegant cafe. The drinks are amazing (white lavender latte, anyone?) and there's a nice rotating selection of monthly specials (both coffee drinks and alcoholic beverages). The food and pastries are pretty tasty, with fun offerings like avocado toast, different types of mac and cheese, all sorts of soups and sandwiches. The wifi is pretty fast and it's a nice place to work or study upstairs; spacious tables, outlets, etc.), especially if you like reggae (not too loud) playing in the background. And you can't beat the hours."}
{"text":"I would literally die for The Grand's fries and aioli sauce. The food and drinks are really good and the atmosphere is awesome! The live music is always so much fun."}
{"text":"Grand Central really embodies an urban vibe and as a student downtown, it's one of my favorite places to go to get off campus to study and grab a coffee with friends. I've been coming here regularly since it first opened and it's been really fun to watch it evolve over the past year or so from a hidden gem into a very popular place for what seems like a mixed crowd of both locals and people visiting. While everything I've tried has been good, their prickly pear lemonade and white chocolate lattes are my favorite. Everything on their food menu is beyond delicious- especially their mac and cheese, which they mix up toppings everyday!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few months now to study.  The place is divided into a variety of spaces that can create a different environment... Tables and couches along with a variety of lighting fixtures create a coffee shop feel.  Althogh it is neither a coffee shop nor a bar.. its both..This place is great for a casual coffee meet up, grab a drink at the bar, or go upstairs to read... If you are not a total coffee snob, the drinks will do you just fine."}
{"text":"Recently came in a few times.  Very excited and impressed with all the renovations.  Equally sad to know that Amsterdam is gone for good-what a great time that place was.  The first time the barista didn't know what Nutella was. -a fine ingredient for a new twist on a cafe mocha.  The second time the frapuccino was amazing.  The third time the cappuccino was terrible.  And served in a 12oz glass made with 4 shots (seriously?)    I also noticed Paella on the menu,  Odd for a coffee shop.   How about making better deserts,   or way better pastries and muffins? Or better yet,  add Pizza or Cornish Pasties to the menu!  And as a lover of finely crafted cocktails, is it true that the speakeasy section is only open 4 hours a week?   Seems like a silly waste of space.    Above all,  I wish you could bring back Amsterdam!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food has diminished in recent months.  Seems like they went from great flavored fresh/farm-to-table food to frozen bland food. I won't be spending my good earned dollars there anymore."}
{"text":"Been coming here for the past couple of months and never got a chance to write a review so here it goes. (Btw i usually dont do this)  I come here any time from like 6pm-2am when is not so hot outside!  Ill start with the food and drinks. I ALWAYS get the mac n cheese and when im feeling wild, i try the mac of the day! The mac n cheese is a must try! They have a large selection of beverages but i stick with Lemonade. Lemonade and Mac is my go to when i come here.  Second but most important is their customer service! which most restaurants lack on. They have the friendliest employees! always smiling always in a good mood and they always make you feel like youve known them for years!!!  The only bad thing about this place is that its pretty hot at times idk if the ac doesnt work but it can get a bit warm in there specially around this time a year. But the night employees make you forget about the heat with friendly conversations and good attitude."}
{"text":"Fun place to stop in after work. Mac n cheese was enjoyed by multiple people at the table. Prices were good and we will be back to try their drink menu next. Parking can be challenging but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Not a good place for dining, also not 24 hours. We arrived at 1240am-Ish, and a gentlemen came over as we were looking at menu. He stated \"the kitchen is closed guys I'm really sorry.\" Which was not impolite. However, a hello or some type of greeting would have been appropriate. We were not offered a drink or anything, the conversation went no further. Other customers had drinks. I don't know if we were just not welcome, or nothing was available.  The stars are for the ambiance. It was really cool! We walked through several rooms to get to the counter, and it would deficiently be a cool place to eat.  Unfortunately we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Worst $50 I ever spent: two lattes, a breakfast sandwich, a bottle of water, a breakfast plate, a blueberry scone.   I'll start with the good... The place is beautifully decorated, open 24 hours, and has a menu with something for everyone. The blueberry scone was delicious. The punch card is a hilarious image of Wonder Woman punching Donald Trump, you won me over. The grand is spacious and it really is easy to find a quiet corner in.The baristas are great.   The bad...I ordered the breakfast sandwich and asked to substitute avocado for bacon, I am a vegetarian. I was charged $2 extra for the avocado because \"there is an avocado shortage in the US making avocado extremely expensive.\" Thank you for the lesson. All I know is there was a ton of avocados available for .69 at Target yesterday, but ok. When my food came I received a 2oz container of avocado smashed with seasoning and lemon (?) that tasted like it was going bad. So no bacon and $1 per oz of old avocado.   The cheapest bottle of water is $3 for about 12oz, not a big deal I appreciate good water but I bought it for my baby who will get half of it on his shirt anyway. I really felt like I was being nickel and dime'd. There are plenty of other coffee shops that also serve food in within a two mile radius who serve quality product and won't break the bank.  Be careful with the large round table upstairs. Its more than a wobbler, its a teeter totter."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is not very good with allergies/dietary restrictions. Ordered the Buffalo Cauliflower after describing that I can't eat dairy products. I was assured it would be okay, but it was served with bleu cheese dressing on a brioche bun, which I can't eat. I sent it back and got avocado toast with the egg removed. However, the bread had butter on it. I already felt like such an annoyance I just stopped eating (luckily didn't experience any health problems) and left. To top it off, the Bell's Two-Hearted IPA I ordered was sour and clearly something was up with it. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because others who don't have health restrictions might have an easier time."}
{"text":"Is it the nostalgia of Amsterdam's that creates my love for this place? Perhaps. I do like walking in and looking at the former dancefloor and picturing my younger self getting my groove on (but I digress).  The beer section is amazing (happy hour from 11-7!!) and the coffee is almost as good. They have spared no time or money in redeveloping the old spot in to a new place to hang out. The décor is like a steampunk train station and the seating area is open and offers a few different levels along with a large outdoor patio.  This is a great spot to relax with friends and I would have spent a lot of time studying here when I was in school. If you happen to find yourself downtown check this place out."}
{"text":"Came here after a d-backs game...all the other bars gave off a club vibe so we were glad we found this place. Their beers were on the warm side...which sucks on a triple-digit hot day. The fries and mac n cheese were good though."}
{"text":"Looks like I rated this place too soon the first time, because difference in my second date at The Grand led to disappointing indifference.   Like a junkie, I tried to chase that first high by ordering the same: Kale Cauliflower Curry, and house fries.   The server brought both dishes at the same time. One glimpse at the lack of fries told me I would be left alone to sweat through my withdrawals.   The kale and cauliflower bowl held up, but I definitely tasted a downgrade. That's what made me look into the kitchen. Ohhh, different chef.   How dare he send out a dish of fries that was kids' portion. No, actually kid's portions are larger than what I got - it was more like a toddler's portion. The server hesitated to return the fries to the kitchen and I seriously thought he was going to justify the amount.   That's when I got a bit snippy and pushed to have them taken off the table. I could see feelings hurt behind his eyes so I assured my anger wasn't directed at him and he took the dish back.   More fries arrived a few minutes later, but it wasn't the delightfully seasoned heap that I received on the first visit. These lacked the seasoning and appeal. These fries were sad. Yes, SAD. That's what I told the server.   When I ate through a few on top, I found bits of something resembling fried meat (maybe bacon).   So to this cook, on that night -- in the annoying tone of D Trump -- \"You're Fired.\""}
{"text":"I docked a star purely cause the A/C was out on one of the hottest days of the year   But that being said.. What !? this place is open 24 hours! And has great food and a pretty decent beer selection! The avocado fries were tasty. I think they are coated in a rice flour and then lightly fried. Served with a super spicy chipotle aioli. The kale and blue salad is a great vegan option ( I'm not vegan, next time I would add meat or cheese). The salad was lightly dressed and the right amount of all ingredients that were present.   The really exciting part of this place is the atmosphere. It's HUGE with all kinds of different seating areas. Awesome patio. It's decorated in a very steam punk sort of way.   I think if you haven't checked this place out you should definitely give it a go!"}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere = 4 stars. Super cool joint, steampunk vibe if you will. The espresso machine was broken, what?!?! The silverware was a nightmare, we literally dug through to find something usable and still wiped it down....maybe their dishwasher was broken but show some pride people!!! We shared a couple things, burger...cauliflower bites...nothing to yelp home about unfortunately. I ended up with a hot tea, it was delicious, they have a large choice of brewed tea. This spot has some enormous potential and a great staff but needs some serious management."}
{"text":"I used to love this place so much, but with the new management, the staff seems frazzled and overworked. I'm still sitting here, 50 minutes later, waiting for three tacos. The WiFi is not working properly. I normally would never complain, but it's been 50(!!!) minutes for THREE tacos. And I think I see them sitting in the window."}
{"text":"They made a mistake with my bill and made up for it in a big way a few days later. We enjoyed our first stop here but a problem with the processed payment caused me and girlfriend to have an ill feeling about this place. However, they made up for it and explained what happened (a simple mistake).   I recommend checking this place out for sure, great decor, great drinks, and great food!"}
{"text":"This has the potential to be the coolest coffee spot in town. And while its spacious, two-story layout is so expansive that it's underutilized, Grand Central is stylish, comfortable, and most importantly...  ...my new favorite day-drinking spot in the valley.  It feels like a bar more than a place to indulge in caffeine! Don't get me wrong, the coffee I've had has been decent. It's just that first you'll notice a giant chalkboard of rare drafts above a bar with plenty of seating--indoor when you want a quiet place to feel classy, and outside when you want to light up, bring your dog, or have a large, raucous group. A nice roast may be an afterthought.   As of right now, it may be a bit unfinished. There's not much of a menu (outside of the beer), and the patio could use a bit of upkeep. But it's such a vast and relaxing atmosphere I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. Really cool vibe and good coffee. Just don't order food. We waited forever to get our meal only to find out they ran out of what we ordered. The wait staff was friendly but that doesn't make up for poor service."}
{"text":"I've been to The Grand about a dozen times and I have to say that it's one of my favorite coffee shops in the Phoenix metro area. I like to get work done at cafes/coffee shops. This place has LOTS of seating area indoors, outdoors, AND upstairs. There's a good amount of outlets all over the place for your electronics. They are open 24/7 and since I'm a night owl, the time I've spent here is mostly late nights. The indoors is mostly pretty dark, but there are patio areas outside so if you are working here at night, it can be nice outdoors (yes, even in this AZ heat).  I usually order the iced mocha latte with soy. I've never tried any of the food items here, so I can't speak for those. There is a parking lot east of the coffee shop, but it's pretty small. My backup parking spot is across the street by the Phoenix Public Market, which is not a far walk at all.   Recommend this place. Love it. I will keep coming back as long as I live in Phoenix!  P.S. Make sure to check their website or social media accounts. Some nights, they have different types of events going on so if you're coming here to get some work done, it might be good to check out what they have scheduled first (if any)."}
{"text":"4 stars for the latte and a brownie. Both were pretty good.  5 stars for the atmosphere, this place is dope! There's levels to this place."}
{"text":"My Fiance and I decided to go on a bike ride around downtown Friday night. We were a little hungry so we made a stop in to have lunch on the patio. The Patio is very chill but very dark with a bar that accessible inside and out. After looking over the menu we decided to order the Tacos. I ordered 3 avocado and my fiance ordered 3 Asada.   As we received our tacos the plate was hot but not so much our food. The tacos were lukewarm on both of our plates. When I began to eat my tacos I was not impressed with my avocado tacos neither was fiance with his asada. I wish the tacos were as good as the price. If in the area I will definatly make another stop in to have a coffee or a beer because I did like the vibe of the place. I'm not to sure if I would try the food again."}
{"text":"Ruben was an exquisite bartender! He is extremely knowledgeable and made our night so much more fun than we expected! The avo fries are bomb but the highlight was definitely Ruben and his incredible cocktails!!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The Grand Coffee House. Coffee \"joints\" seem to be springing up all over. Some are good; some are just so-so. The Grand is certainly in its infancy stage but, if the coffee is any indication of what the final will be, they may just have a winner.   The Coffee House and Front Bar take up just a small portion of this large building. There is also a large patio with a window to the bar.  I attended an event here that included a complete tour of the large party rooms. There are three (at least that I saw). Excellent opportunities for large company or family holiday events.  The interior design decorations are large scale and one-of-a kind. Collected by the owner from NY to AZ. My assessment of the design would be \"large-scale eclectic.\" Antiques, modern, country, old world . . . a little of everything. But it all seems to fit and is very welcoming. He definitely has an eye for the unusual . . . and, yet, it seems homey and very comfortable. And, most of all . . . FUN!  The event I attended had food prepared by their chef. It was excellent. And the alcohol drinks on their menu board sounded fun. Just like the rest of The Grand Coffee House. Definitely worth a try. Watch for the Grand Opening coming soon!"}
{"text":"ADORE THIS PLACE!!!! The go-to spot. 24 hours?? And amazing vegan options! I mean, the cauliflower wings are to die for. And sometimes there's live music! And downtown is where it's at. It's the heart of the fun parts of Phoenix. If you're new to Phoenix come here!!!"}
{"text":"The jury is still out on this place. They didn't have drip coffee because they \"only sell two cups a day\" according to the barista. Sure it's the middle of summer, but I see this as a marketing/quality issue. I tried a muffin and it was stale and bland, I honestly can't tell what kind of muffin it was. There is entire campus a block south of this place and customers will walk here if they have a quality product. Service was okay, no complaints but I wasn't particularly impressed. With so many great choices nearby they have a lot of work to do. On the plus side the interior is great and patio looks promising. I'll be back in a month to see how it progresses."}
{"text":"It was my first time here, and I had an awesome experience. The bartender, Bratt, was really nice and courteous. He had a lot of energy and was genuinely nice. I had their mac n' cheese and it was delicious! Also, I had a happy hour beer for $4!  The place has two levels, where the bottom level is where people socialize and the upstairs is where people work. I LOVED that there were plenty of plugs for my laptop! It's a big plus when I'm looking for a coffee shop to work at.  I would recommend to friends :)"}
{"text":"Beautiful place terrible experience with a manger who spoke to us as if we were bothering him and he lacked any customer service experience, had no regard to what happened and just walked away from us with a horrible attitude."}
{"text":"Being vegetarian I was so excited to try the Cauliflower sandwich. Unfortunately it tasted like straight vinegar, it was awful. My boyfriends burger was burnt as well. When the bartender asked us for fries it was actually $2.50 EACH. At most places fries on the side are complimentary with a dish, and he didn't let us know it would be extra. Service was great and the drink menu was amazing, that's the ONLY reason I gave this place two stars."}
{"text":"I've made it my mission to check out all the coffee shops that serve adult beverages as well. This place came up on my search. So of course I checked it out. It also helped that many of my elite friends had given it a rave review. They weren't lying. This place was awesome.  I've been to three other coffee shop/bars in town and this one might be my favorite so far. I loved the vintage decore, there was plenty of seating (inside and out), it has two stories and a nice craft beer list. Oh and a happy hour. My pint was only $5.   This might be a stretch but it's kinda like the Disneyland of coffee shops. Not so much as bright and colorful, but tons of cool things to lool at. So hopefully you're not easily distracted."}
{"text":"Come see Ryan Gosling working behind the bar!! great service here at The Grand Central Coffee Company !"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVED the Grand! What a cute spot right in Phoenix. Had a great glass of wine and ordered the tacos and hummus (YUM). We sat outdoors and loved the ambiance!"}
{"text":"Kyle is a solid bartender, very attentive, and can keep a good conversation going! I really enjoyed the ambiance of the building inside and out. Considerably wide selection of coffee, beer, food and even teas! Very inviting place!"}
{"text":"Do not get the caramel apple martini!! Boyfriend got an IPA, his was alright. The environment was cute and large... the bar area was full and it took awhile to get drinks and servers mindlessly walked around several times with no regard for helping us newcomers. Not sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the customer service needs some serious improvement. The cashier literally tossed my receipt at me. A guy in front of me got coffee and got a lid on it but when I got mines she didn't put a lid on it or asked if I wanted creamer but instead she was busy talking to one of her friends that was visiting her at work. The workers just kept talking and not even paying attention to the customers. I work in the food industry and this is the worst customer service I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"First time here and I got the Chai latte and oh my goshhh. It was so good!!!! The atmosphere is so unique and I loved it"}
{"text":"So The Grand has been open since July of 2016. But I feel that not many people know about it. It's same set up like LUX but twice as big. It's 2 store club that was transformed into a coffee shop/bar/food spot.The lattes are so good here!! Also there building a stage outside for live performance that will be going on Friday nights. Such a chill spot with so many couches and tables to sit at with power outlets to do your work. People here are super chill and quite. The barista here is a previous employee from jobot so he's got all the skill needed to put manic in your cup. Check it out, don't play your self."}
{"text":"Good coffee, GREAT atmosphere. Tons of space, nice employees, great seating options. Seriously: a great hangout or study location. I'm not a coffee snob, I'll leave that review to those who know the trade. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I have been here a few times and it's always been a great experience! Today, however, was even greater, it was the BEST! Maya was a GEM! She went above and beyond as I was getting some goods for my friend. She was so nice, super attentive, and she truly loves her job, you can just tell. This coffee shop should be so grateful to have such an awesome barista."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I live at Cityscape and have been looking for a place with a great atmosphere, conducive to studying, and where I can grab a bite or a drink. The Grand NAILS it. They have an upstairs area that is quiet for studying, and the downstairs is great for hanging out. It's also not borderline refrigerated like most places in Arizona.   Menu is solid and prices are fair. My fav. is the Arnold Palmer with Prickly Pear tea, but plenty to choose from. Nothing to complain about here!"}
{"text":"This place is exquisite! The atmosphere is wonderful for people who need a place to study and for people who want to enjoy a cocktail with friends. With that, the service is incredible! My favorite server, Tori, is incredibly accommodating and kind. Along with the atmosphere, people like her are the reason this place is so great! I would recommend this place to anyone. If you go for drinks, try the \"Strange Brew\". Keep being awesome!"}
{"text":"Only two weeks old and true to its name, the Grand Central Coffee Company is reminiscent of an old train station, exuding a vintage flair and charm. With home brewed lattes made in-house and all craft beers on happy hour from 11am-7pm, this new venue is sure to be a hit downtown. Located across the street from the Phoenix Public Market, the converted coffeehouse still has parts of its old heritage, a nightclub, transitioning in the making. With two floors, two outdoor bars (work in progress), and a kitchen remodel, you can still stroll up and down the staircase exploring what's to be, as the large venue is not completely finished. In the meantime, revel in its mystique with a delicious sip and ample comfy couches before the crowds come."}
{"text":"Disappointing as a lunch place. Two of us ordered the strawberry spinach salad and it came out with just strawberries on a bed of spinach with a very small side of dressing. Where was the cheese?   It also took way too long to prepare 3 salads and a sandwich. Fries had no salt. The soda lines at the bar need cleaning. The coke came out tasting fruity.  The care in preparing food was just subpar."}
{"text":"No greeting. Asked about non alcoholic drinks, was kinda rushed. I then asked what sizes they had and got a reply of \"yeah\".... oh okay? Then me and my friend ordered the same thing the zombie with the Mac and cheese, both were different in every way shape and form... look at the pictures.   What a weird place. Service was crap, food was meh, drink was just okay"}
{"text":"A decent coffee place downtown. Their latte had good flavor, but the cold brew was very bitter. Plenty of space to grab a spot to work by yourself or with a group. The music they were playing did not really suit me. It was a sleepy trance-like music that defeats the purpose of why I'm getting coffee in the first place. They do serve alcohol which makes it a good place to hangout, but I would not go out of my way to come here for coffee."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place! A friend suggested that we come here for drinks after work and I was very impressed with the experience. The Grand is a steampunkis/speakeasy-like/intimate bar with a vast array of drinks and great music. My friend also let me know that there is live music. We saw that there was very nice and cooled outdoor seating which I will definitely be trying soon! The bar staff was also very helpful, friendly and knew what they were doing as far as making very unique and tasty drinks. The Grand is also open 24 hours! Great for people who are looking to do some homework or get out of the house! I will be coming back soon for sure."}
{"text":"Made the unfortunate mistake of going here this afternoon. Ridiculously SLOW service, subpar drinks, and forced tipping. Don't bother wasting your time here."}
{"text":"I came to Phoenix for a nursing conference and my friend and I decided to go out and explore. We were hungry and decided to stop here since the place looked pretty cool.   We ordered our food, some tacos, and we were told our food would come out in a few. Well, time kept passing by and our food was nowhere to be found. When we went to the front to ask them about our food, they said they forgot to put in the order or something like that. They apologized and said that the tacos they had made were for some managers. Okay... awesome.... what about your customers? It literally took them an hour to bring us our food.  My friend wanted to leave after they told us they forgot about us, but we decided to stay because we were starving.  I know sometimes people can forget things, but when your customers are hungry and have waited for an hour, do not say your managers get served before us. Just don't.   Overall, the quinoa taco was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"I like this place, the staff is friendly and welcoming. The menu is very varied and offers everything from a full bar to espresso drinks, salads and sandwiches. I had a capuccino and it was perfectly made. There is plenty of seating on two levels and also outside. It is really cool that they are open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Unique setting.  One-of-a-kind coffee shop right in the heart of downtown Phoenix. Really good coffee and tea selection, pastries, and a million little nooks and crannies for you to explore. Worth a look."}
{"text":"Great, new spot for 24 hour coffee and bites. Couldn't be happier that not only is there an option that is both open on the weekend and nights, but it's also GOOD! Had one of their huge brownies. Awesome. Had two different types of iced coffee. Awesome. Would definitely recommend this place. Looking forward to coming back and trying everything on the menu."}
{"text":"The Po Boys & dope vibe gives this place a 5 in my book!"}
{"text":"This place is a great place to study!  It's spacious, and relaxing!  Their interior design is cool too, feels like you are in a coffee shop in NYC.   I've hung out at the bar with a friend as well... there is not much of a variety of drafts but the bar tender was very friendly and offered us the many other varieties of mix drinks they had to offer .  I definitely recommend this place for meetings , studying time, or just catch up with a friend .   The location is pretty tricky to find.. the \"light rail\" separates the location, and \"the one way\" ,  tricks me into going to del Soto coffee shop down the street instead ...  I recommended giving this place a shot!"}
{"text":"a friend of mine and a group of her friends who were LGBT refused service because of their sexual identity. This friend who just an ordenary person and a good person too and not offensive about their sexuality but still , this type of behavior by any establishment should not be tolerated"}
{"text":"I lalalalove this spot. The decor is top notch, the staff is super friendly and the people here are very diverse and cool. The coffee is pretty good and everything I have had for food here has been great as well. The outdoor patio seating is adorable and the indoor seating features a variety of spots just for whatever occasion you are at a coffee shop for. They have a full service bar if that is what you are looking. There is seating for large groups, individuals, and couples. Upstairs and outside is slightly quieter if that is what you are looking for. Definitely come check out this place for great love music and chill DJ music as well depending on when you are here. I will be here often."}
{"text":"Great location, vibe, staff, beer and coffee choices, live music and much more. Expand the food menu for five stars."}
{"text":"I stopped into this new coffee shop today after reading about it on AZ Central. I was excited to see what they did with the old Amsterdam bar.. When I arrived, I found it a little difficult to park because it's located on a one way street ...so for everyone trying to park, make sure that you go South one street to pierce and then turn into the small road to the left side of the light rail so that you can turn into their parking lot. The place has very cute decor, with clocks showing the time  in different parts of the world(you know, grand central themed). They have a loft area upstairs and ample seating downstairs (the perfect place to hang out and study or chat with friends). The staff were all friendly and helpful. They source their coffee from infusion coffee and tea in Tempe and get their chai from David Rio. Essentially the drinks here are like the drinks at infusion Coffee and Tea (aka delish), but far closer to my house (even better). They also have a full bar and many beer taps (a variety of local and nonlocal craft brews at a decent price point). Their happy hour right now is from 11 to 7...most excellent. I know I will be making many return trips to Grand Central and recommend you do the same!"}
{"text":"Last year I wrote a wonderful review of this place. I am retracting most of it now. Thinking it would be wonderful for my Niece Jasmine's baby shower, I tried to contact them by e mail for over 2 months before I went in person and talked to the ratty haired blond in charge of events. I wanted to have a Gold Coast Theme Gentlemen's area for the father and his party and then a separate area for the mother and hers reminiscent of the 1900s New York Society events. Well I was told NO and given the brush off like I wasn't even welcomed.  Well, I made other accommodations and as a result I would never recommend this place again. There are so many there alternatives that rude treatment like I experienced is never ok. The staff there was disgraceful! If I could give it less than one star I would."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place from a classmate.   One day I finally caved and tried it out.  I find that I cannot study very well at home so I am always looking for places to get my study groove on.  Number 1 positive - it's open 24 hours!!  I can come anytime and it's here.  They have a reverse happy hour and a mini menu for late night sessions.  There is so much space around it's ridiculous and you can spread out as you need to.  They also have plenty of places to charge up, upstairs as well as down.  I have mostly come at night since my hours are off and the crew I've encountered have been super friendly and accommodating.  The only reason not for 5 stars is it can be sorry of dark in the joint.  I don't know how it looks during the day and they do have lamps but it does get a small feel of romantic setting.  Also they play music super loud all night.  That won't stop me from coming though, I can bring headphones to down out the sound and enjoy the space."}
{"text":"I really want to rate this place higher and am tempted to do so just because they're open 24 hours and our city needs those spots badly. However, the service has consistently been subpar. Several times, the ladies working the counter have attitudes and are rude. One time in particular, one of the gals did not want to help us and then gave us an attitude for asking questions about the menu. Come to find out, she wanted to hang out with her bf in the corner (who also worked there) and eat food. On a separate occasion, one of the ladies working the counter was rude because we didn't yet know where we were sitting before ordering. Sorry, but not everyone figures this out before ordering and if that's an expectation, perhaps post it. Don't take that stuff out on the customer, that's your bad homie. Sometimes the music is good and sometimes it's super bad."}
{"text":"Not my favorite coffee in the downtown area, but The Grand has pretty good caffeine and breakfast options in a very nice space, both inside and outside. This is where I would come in the mornings to write a novel if I ever get around to it, or for cocktails at night. Open 24-7, the Grand has something for everyone in a cool location."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I'm an introvert, so I prefer when it's quiet.  I've been here 3 times now.  Service is incredible.  And they recently opened the kitchen.  Bottom line: get the short rib eggs benedict.  The head chef Jacquelynn is phenomenal.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is great for a casual breakfast or lunch. Plenty of space to hang out with friends or having a business meeting. Low noise, good food & coffee, and decent prices.  I had the breakfast bowl - it was delicious. Just wish there was more of it.  Only thing that could make this 5 stars would be for larger portions. The prices aren't bad, but the amount of food you get for the price isn't great. I was still hungry after spending $9 on breakfast."}
{"text":"One of the best coffee shops I've been to, and I've been to many!  First and most important to me, this coffee shop is *huge* and has amazing support for remote workers. Large tables, plenty of power outlets (and I mean plenty!), and too many nooks and crannies to hide yourself in to count.  The menu is fantastic any time of day. You can get a scotch & cigar and 4am in the morning -what a treat! I recommend trying the \"Mac of The Day,\" which is a different take on macaroni each day. (Some have included: pot pie macaroni, buffalo chicken, etc)  I really enjoy the bar options as well. Plenty on tap and specialty drinks. It's the only place I've been able to find a good lambic/sour beer (coming from Chicago where they are plentiful, I've been sad!)  Service is a little slow times, but that's to be expected with the large interest in this place.  Check out some of the pictures too. This place is BEAUTIFUL, both outdoors and inside. 10/10, if I had a coffee shop, this is exactly what it would be."}
{"text":"Nice indoor and outdoor seating, however service is not provided. My friend and I didn't get menus or didn't even asked for drinks. The Grand Scramble then, the biggest disappointment: very bland dish with no flavor. My friend had the Market Scramble and it was the same. Perhaps other dishes are better, but I wouldn't rush to go back."}
{"text":"Studying in the Grand Central Coffee Company feels like you're having a cup of coffee and reading a book in an old mysterious mansion.  There are various rooms and balconies to explore, some of which are hidden away in unexpected areas.  There's even a huge ballroom where it feels like you're in a castle in Transylvania.  The florescent bar menu (they serve both alcohol and caffeine) is clever and fun, and my iced mocha was perfect - not too sweet, and comparatively priced with other coffee houses in town.  The large size of the place makes it so you can be close to the action (aka the bar) if you'd like, or you can have a quiet corner all to yourself.  I can't wait to come back and explore some more!"}
{"text":"I showed up and was expecting this place just to be a coffee house, but when I walked it there was a kitchen, open bar, and a study if I was attending ASU I come here almost everyday to study. It's a nice open environment. You could definitely make friends and meet new people or have a drink or something to eat. It's chill and I like the vibes here."}
{"text":"This place has some amazing architecture! I love this place and was able to try out quite a few teas that they had and they were spectacular! I was told there is also a club connected to this place and they also serve beer at the coffee bar! I would definitely recommend this place for studying, relaxing and lounging with friends, or just finding a place for great Coffee & Tea!"}
{"text":"Really awesome ambiance and decor but 2 out of 2 Sunday's they were out of champagne. The food was subpar.  Good place for drinks and beer but wouldn't recommend for brunch or Sunday funday."}
{"text":"If I could give different ratings for different aspects, it would be this:  ***** (5 stars) for the space. Whether you're looking for a quiet nook to study with a latte, or happy hour drinks on the patio, the space is divine. Interior decked to resemble the inside of a train station, it's gorgeous & worth exploring. Special mention: the steampunked bike rack.  *** (3 stars) for cocktails, coffee, bartending staff and value (you are paying for location & ambience).  * (1 star) for food & food service (and that's being generous). Over-cooked burgers unappetizingly presented with wilted lettuce, house special bacon & chive mac and cheese that arrived with NO bacon, child's chicken tenders so over-cooked & dried out they were inedible. And the server seemed annoyed at every question (where can I find silverware?) or request (does this have bacon in it? Can I get bacon in it?), and getting the simplest things wrong (can I get a box? and being handed a bag).   I'd consider future cocktails on the patio - but I value my digestive system, so that's a hard pass on ordering food."}
