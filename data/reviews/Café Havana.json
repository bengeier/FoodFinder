{"text":"Food was very good! The lady serving us was also doing the cooking and came out several times to chat with us. It was a great eating experience. Give it a try if you want something different and fresh instead of your typical chained restaurant...prices were very reasonable too. I ordered the tamales, my boyfriend ordered the Cuban sandwich and we also tried the plantain \"tostones\", ropa vieja (which was delicious) and the tres leche cake (not as sweet as my mom makes it, which is peruvian style, but it was still good)"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! We got the Ropa Vieja (Shredded beef over a reduction of dry wine with creole sauce) and the roasted pork, with a side of fried plantain and stuffed potato. Just amazingly delicious! You also get fairly big portions and the customer service is great. The only downside is that it's not great for eating-in as the atmosphere is more like a fast-food joint."}
{"text":"I visited this place for a change from the typical \"Jack Astor's & McDonald's\" etc, which is definitely a \"hidden gem\" and I mean hidden, but given its location the people that seem to go there are local residents in the area. I am not a resident of the area but I was totally shocked by the great food. 

First off it definitely didn't spark any excitement when I walked in, but as soon as you talk to I would assume owners they really try their best to give you the best service they possible can and from there I knew I have come across something special. 

The next thing I notice was how clean the restaurant was and how they seem to have some of the most up-to-date expresso machine like the ones a true cafe would have so don't doubt the name when you read \"Havana cafe\". It is truly a cafe with some great strong latte to wake you up for days. 

The next thing I notice was how they really live up to their other part of name \" Havana\" aka Cuban food. It's truly authentic Cuban food, I was a bit thrown off when I saw the sign outside the restaurant reading \"pizza\", but I didn't let that stop me from walking in, so proceed forward. 

The owner suggested the areas to order from the menu being their pizzas, and sandwiches. I went to order a sandwich but the owner suggested a more authentic sandwich from the one I selected, so I said OK let's go for it. My girlfriend ordered a rice and pulled beef dish, forget the name but you'll know it when you see it. So for my dish (sandwich) it was pulled pork with mustard, pickles, cheese, and some other ingredients all lighted toasted very good and more than enough to fill you up. 

The girlfriend's dish was even better as I kept eating away at her dish as it came with sliced fried sweet plantain, the most delicious rice I ever had and the best pulled pork ever and it is not the typical pull pork....its flavour was amazing. 

The price of each dish is between $9.99-13.99 and do get a latte and it is worth the $2.75. So give this place a shot and you'll be pleasantly surprised as I was."}
{"text":"This is my new home away from home. Absolutely great food and a family owned restaurant. Super friendly people. Their menu is reasonably priced and you get a lot of food for your money. The Teresita pizza is amazing! You can't go wrong with anything pork....yummmm. Don't get me started on the Tamales :-). This is making me hungry. Time to head out there now."}
{"text":"Great Cuban restaurant with homemade food. Big portions. Also does a great pizza. Sandwiches and pork dishes are really tasty."}
{"text":"If I was closer!
This place is great, the best cuban food around Toronto. They serve the typical Cuban food you would find in any Cuban house. 
The owner is very friendly, talk to her and look at how big her smile is!
Go and try it, you will like it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant with great food, excellent prices and warm and authentic ambiance. The owner is on site and is full of character and personality. After eating there I wanted to write a great review so that as many people as possible would go as it deserves to be a great success."}
{"text":"The portions are BIG so you better get there hungry. I ordered the Ropa Vieja plate that comes with flank steak (nicely seasoned), rice and black beans and plantains. It was very good. The juices are excellent and huge. Nice service."}
{"text":"The best and authentic Cuban food in the area. True story coming from a campesino de Holguin."}
{"text":"Great sandwich, amazing mango drink and really good pizza - my kids loved it. It is their new favourite."}
{"text":"Love this little unassuming Cuban restaurant in Oakville.  The food is great. Home style Cuban cooking like abuela makes. And I should know, I'm half Cuban. The ropa vieja is excellent and served with congri (white rice cooked together with black beans) and fried plantains.  I have it every time I go. I should probably try something different next time but it's just so good. And if you go, do yourself a favor and try the batido de mamey (mamey milkshake).   It's a quintessential Cuban fruit and it's delicious."}
{"text":"I can only have good things to say about Cafe Havana.  The service is just OUTSTANDING and the food its superb!!!  It's a family business and the owners are the ones that serve you.  Is t that awesome? Try the congri, one of their smoothies or the ropa vieja.  You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Very nice Cuban restaurant/cafe! Good sandwiches and I liked their Mango smoothie too.
This is the only place with authentic Cuban food and atmosphere I have seen so far in the area. 
It is family owned and the owners are very warm and nice people."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Good price. Very friendly staff. We actually danced salsa there and had so much fun. We liked how the management put a good effort to make the place as close to Cuban authentic as possible. We are going back again. Recommended.

Ordered: Ropa Vieja. The Shredded Beef Pizza. Mamey milkshake and Sousop milkshake."}
{"text":"I found this cafe by accident,  was looking for something to eat and just had a feeling they would be amazing, was I ever right!

Pizza Varadero is all I can say!!! The girls always make fun of me and know who I am by my order every time. (mango milkshake, pizza Varadero is my name) If you're able to make it to this cafe please do yourself a favour and go. This is true soul food, it makes your soul feel good. This place makes me happy. The two girls there put the biggest smile on my face. One time, I was so excited to devour the pizza I started immediately in my car and the wonderful owner knocked on my window to give me napkins!! They are so SWEET. You feel like this is family feeding you! Places like this deserve recognition and support!
This place is a true gem, I could not recommend it more with my entire heart! The pizza is to die for, the Tamale (Cuban dish with pork and cornmeal)... There are NO words, just mouthwatering and amazing... her perfect coconut cake is delicious and moist and heavenly every time, the cabezotes, this amazing Cuban pastry, omg. Be careful, I have eaten 6 at one time in the past. 

Please give these girls a visit, and I promise you won't be disappointed. This place is truly authentic. Even if you don't think you like Cuban food, please try them out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great shredded beef, plantains and rice n beans. Friendly staff too. Delicious Cuban food."}
{"text":"I'll start with the negative, because there is so little that was.  The rice and beans were a bit bland compared to other Cuban restaurants we've been to.  The roasted pork was a bit dry.  Other than that everything was amazing.  The service is top notch.  Overall, the food is incredible.  We tried a bit of everything, sandwiches, pork, beef, pizza.  The shining stars of the experience, other than the owners, the desserts and the Cuban coffee.   The mango milkshakes were insanely good too.  The little Cuban lady who owns the place chatted us up a lot, especially considering how little English she knows.  She is super nice.  We'll be going back."}
{"text":"First time having Cuban food! I believe I got an authentic experience. Service was amazing. The sandwiches and main entr√©es were great! The lady who runs the place is awesome!!  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"What a great find on the road! You feel welcomed from the second you step in the door. Everything smelled amazing. With a huge list of items, and it being lunch, I narrowed it down to a traditional Cuban sandwich and had a side of black beans and rice. It was heaven! Reminded me of my visits to Key West where the Cuban food is unbelievable. Followed it up with some cake and a Cafe con leche and I was ready for a nap. Would highly recommend swinging through and eating at this gem!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today and was really impressed with the quality of the food. I ordered roast pork Cuban sandwhich and beef tamale. Both were delicious, I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Cafe Havana was amazing! We felt like we were at home and our parents were making a home made meal. My wife had the Cuban sandwich and she loved it. I had la ropa vieja with congris and my in-laws had the carne de puerco. It was delicious!!! You have to try this place. Oh and before I forget...try el tamal y Los tostones!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Super Jose for lunch.  Good lord!  Why would any sane person in Oakville not eat at this place on the regular?  Fresh, authentic Cuban food."}
{"text":"A small dig in a strip plaza in the middle of a dense residential neighborhood of a small town. I wouldn't have thought about going here if it were not for the Yelp community. 

It is so hard to find Cuban food in Mississauga. Our Latino food culture is mostly Colombian, but when you want a good Cuban sandwich, going east to TO seems like the only option. 

Thankfully, Cafe Havana brings a bit of the home of the real rumba to your table in the Halton region. Cuban sandwich galore, a different ingredient palette for pizza, and Cuban pastas. 

The small interior felt homey with the red walls, chalkboards, flags, and straw hats that covered the area. A TV rolls Latin Pop classics of the 90s and if it weren't for the lack of space and my own shame, I'd probably have danced. 

Food. The sandwiches are awesome. I had the Cuban sisters with a non-spicy chorizo, ham, roasted pork, pickles, cheese, and mustard. The combination of the three meats was a lovely, and succulent bite of pork. Pickles and mustard were perfect cuts of bright flavours to the palette. 

The tostones were perfect. Not dry, still a little thick, and a light crust of starch on the outside. The yuca fries were also delicious. The garlic sauce served was a nice saltiness. I'd have liked some sort of vegetable or salsa to cut the starch. 

Nutty Cuban espresso, a dense flan, and a tres leches cake made the rest of the dinner. The tres leches does not have a real cream on the outside which I regret, but the yellow cake and condensada in the middle was lovely. Coming back for the guava turnovers if they have them!

Thank you, Cafe Havana. You've brought so much flavour to a neighbourhood that wouldn't have expected it. Coming back many times."}
{"text":"I ordered a cuban sandwich to go a week ago and while all the ingredients were fresh, I think I just wasn't used to there being big chunks of pork in a Cuban sandwich. Service was quick and friendly staff on a quiet Saturday afternoon in their restaurant. Pay in cash if you can! I'll be back to try some other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Sisters sandwich - eat it while it's hot! The chorizo and a dash of hot sauce take this Hollywood cubano sandwich to the next level and beyond.  Had the Cuban latte as well - awesome.  Family run restaurant - awards won are well deserved"}
{"text":"3.5, but rounded up for friendly service!

Warning:  No AC on one of the hottest days of Summer, but somehow I overlooked it.  If you have a heart condition, this may not be the place for you if the AC is still out!

In short, this place had tasty food.  Much better than the Cuban resorts, that's for sure!  Portions are decent and prices are reasonable/slightly-higher, but definitely not a \"cheap\" place by any means.

The Cuban Sisters sandwich was quite large and totally shareable!  Ropa Vieja was better here than I've had at an authentic place in Varadero, off the resort.  Rice and beans were soo good and pulled beef was very tasty.

A few of the shakes, drinks, & menu items weren't available, but for some reason, that did not bother me.  Perhaps it was the friendly service made up for it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing by far the best Cuban spot in oakville,what more can you ask for being in Canada,food is always fresh,flan is to die for,Cuban sandwich right on the spot,we love it and we keep coming back!"}
{"text":"We arrived starved in a Sunday afternoon about 3pm. We are Dominican so we love our pork and rice. We got the tamal and yuca to start. The pork was the highlight of eveything I ate. 

3 of us on the table ordered the Roasted pork entree which is served with Congri (rice and black beans with cumin) and sweet plantain. Since We arrived in between meals, the rice was good but cold. The pork however has me thinking about it 3 days later. I will be ordering some of that good stuff for Christmas.

They also have sandwiches and pizza, which were being had by the table nearby and looked fantastic and homemade. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food - feels like you are in real Havana without the flight. Great service and ambiance . Will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I like to try new and different cuisine/restaurants. We were in the Oakville area and we were looking for a particular Cuban restaurant but when we got there we found out it's not there anymore, so we googled for other restaurants in the area and saw Cafe Havana is close by. We were glad to have found it. Their cuban sister sandwich was so good and and big enough for two. We also ordered ropa vieja - cuban pulled beef, sooo tasty. The owners were the ones serving and it was excellent service. It was worth the drive to Oakville!  And we will definitely go back to try the other dishes on the menu!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, very friendly family owned restaurant makes me feel homesick. Being from Venezuela I was easily related to one of the best Cuban food I've had. I recommend Ropa Vieja, Tamales and Croquetas"}
{"text":"Had an absolute amazing time at Cafe Havana. I've never really known what Cuban food was until I got a small idea watching the movie \"Chef\". I knew I wanted to try a Cuban sandwich! Fast forward a few years and I see a small Cuban cafe in Oakville , stopped by and wow! I want more just thinking about.

I wanted to try a bit of everything so I ended up ordering too much for two people(myself and girlfriend) we got the Cuban sandwich, so good- pork,cheese, ham, pickles, and mustard on a grill press.

Then we got a roasted pork and the ropa vieja both come with Cuban rice and fried plantains. The roasted pork was excellent with caramelized onions so tender it falls apart with the fork. However the star of the table was the ropa vieja. It is pulled beef in a red wine reduction that is just amazing tasting when you have it with the rice. Beer is a must have with these dishes as it complements perfectly.

And of course, once we finished I had an espresso to top it all off, best meal I've had in a while.

Excellent!"}
{"text":"I just tried out Cafe Havana - this was my first time having Cuban food, and I had seen the Cuban Sandwich in the movie Chef and wanted to try it out. My Husband and I both got the Cuban sandwich and a pop. The wait time was short, and the sandwiches were on our table within minutes. 

I should note here that I am a life-long hater of mustard. I've never liked it, not on anything. The Cuban sandwich comes with roasted pork, ham, mozzarella cheese, pickles and mustard, and I was aware of that, but decided to give it a go anyway.

Oh my lord, I'm glad I did. It was one DELICIOUS sandwich. First off, it's a HUGE sandwich, we definitely didn't need a side. The pickles and mustard were perfectly paired with the bread and the pork. The pork smelled so delicious while it was cooking, my mouth was watering. It was such a large portion, I couldn't even finish it and took the rest home.

One of the owners, a very nice Cuban lady, was the one who delivered our sandwiches. We told her it was our first time trying Cuban food, and she suggested trying the tamale, which came with roasted pork on it. We took her up on it, and my Husband was moaning with delight as he ate the corn tamale - he LOVED it. It was SO good.

For 2 sandwiches, the large tamale and 2 pops, our total came to $36, which is a very reasonable price, especially for Oakville. We will definitely be coming back for more Cubanos from Cafe Havana, and next time, I think we'll try out the Yucca and the Plantains. :)"}
