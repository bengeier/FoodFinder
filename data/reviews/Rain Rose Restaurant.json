{"text":"The best Russian food I have had in Las Vegas. Everything me and my friends ordered tasted great. They have some nice music you can dance to as well. We all had a blast."}
{"text":"Great authentic Russian food off the strip.   Came here with my girlfriend (who is Russian), she really liked the borsch and chicken cotlety, which is similar to meatloaf.  I ate the lamb shish kabob, which was very good. Friendly owner/wait staff. Menu is in English, which is good since I am American and don't read Russian.  Worth a trip if you want to try some good Russian food!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, from first bite to last fork of Napolean. So friendly, handcrafted food, the kind of place where the chef comes out, explains what you ask with a big smile as though he's so happy you came. Some accents of course because they're from Moscow and Kazakhstan. The food is as authentic as their delightful cuisine. This is a slice of another country. Since Kazakhstan is close to China expect some fusion."}
{"text":"This place was terrific. The service was great. The food fabulous. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place, I'm glad I took a chance on a new restaurant with zero reviews. Their Russian food was excellent  We had the marinated Georgian eggplant, beef stroganoff and the Pelimeni dumplings.  So good. Reasonable prices too. Their Grand Opening is June 9 and they are having a party!"}
