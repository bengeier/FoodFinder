{"text":"Finally made it to Pickle Bills after wanting to go for a very long time! We came in on a friend's boat which was much cooler than parking in the parking lot :) It was a Friday evening and we weren't really thinking, so didn't make a reservation beforehand. Someone in our party  suggested we sit on the deck/patio on the 2nd floor, but when we made our way up there, we discovered they only sell three or four fried appetizers. We managed to put in a reservation for 13 and waited about 10 minutes, so I was very impressed how quickly they were able to accomodate us. Especially since upon entering it appeared they had a completely full house.   Inside, the decor is bizarre in a fun way. Absolutely charming! I used the restroom and was slightly confused by the mannequin I thought was a person, and the person I thought was a mannequin! Every square inch of the walls are covered with bright colors, pictures, and other knick-knacky type stuff. The place is huge inside too. They have tons of seating inside, plus a huge bar, and an outside deck, as well as the upstairs indoor bar and outdoor patio (which I'm told they sometimes have bands/DJ's on the upstairs outdoor patio, but saddly there was no live entertainment when we were there). They also have a fun \"barge\" type bar out in the water that is covered with a brightly colored canopy and bright lights which reminded me of a carousel. Oh, and how can I forget the swings!? They have painted wooden swings secured to the ceiling that you can sit on at the bar . Now how cool is that!?   The food was amazing! It's kind of pricey, but I would be wary of any seafood place that wasn't. I had the lobster bisque to start off (something I will never, ever pass up on a menu!), and crab cakes as an entree with some type of garlic-y mashed potatoes. Everything was excellent, and our server was awesome!! She was very attentive to our party, most of whom were a little tipsy by the time we sat down to eat.   After dinner, we walked back out to where the boat was docked for more cocktails (that we brought, so they were free!) and people/boat watched for quite some time. Pckle Bills is completely illuminated at nighttime so we had great views of the river, restaurant and other boats and people. I could have sat there all night!   Overall, Pickle Bills was a great experience that I highly recommend. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The service was very weak. We kept a running list of errors - I think the final tally was around 10, ranging from bringing appetizers after the dinner was delivered, having to wait for baked potatoes after dinner was finished, no water... you get the picture.   Food was no so spectacular. I had the fine fish bucket. Lobster was so-so, the rest was ok. Chocolate mousse was not mousse but some extruded air-infused pudding - inedible.  Dortmunder Gold on tap was bad. I couldn't tell if it was the beer or the draft lines. Stick to bottles.   We had heard lots of good things about this place but failed to find them on this trip."}
{"text":"Pickle Bill's has a lot of lunch and dinner options, with a fun, quirky decorated interior. The location right on the river is fabulous and it's fun to sit on the deck and watch the boats.   It's a little over priced,but the food is okay."}
{"text":"Good view. Unfortunately, service was lacking and menu seemed limited. Was going to share a $40 entree with my sister but they do sharing fees so we got our own meals. Her crab legs were pretty good but my coconut shrimp was terribly sweet. We actually watched our food go to the wrong table, and later they ran food to us that was for another table, not sure what that was all about. Margaritas were WEAK."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service so so. Haven't been to Pickle Bills in a little while. Didn't seem to busy. Still, will we come back? Sure. Were we a little disappointed? Sure."}
{"text":"SO MUCH FOOD!!!! Crazy all you can eat restaurant! We sat by the water and loved the atmosphere! Fried shrimp and coconut shrimp were amazing! We all over ate- but it was worth it! Definitely recommend reservations- wait can be long."}
{"text":"The service deserves 5 stars. We went early June and the weather was good so the climate inside was fine. We got yellow perch, the AYCE shrimp, and AYCE snow crab. They all were very good. The corn on the cob was bad but corn isn't in season yet so it was understandable. The waitress was very nice and kind. Never got into a fight with manager. I give this 5 stars because it was very nice experience for newcomers. Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday evening when I had some family visiting Cleveland. This ended up being quite a drive from where I live but was so worth it!  The restaurant itself is really fun. There is fun and crazy decor that makes for a fun atmosphere during the meal. The restaurant is also situated on the lake, but unfortunately it was dark by the time we arrived and we weren't able to enjoy the view. They started us off with some fried dough with honey cinnamon butter instead of the traditional bread basket. This was pretty good, although probably not worth ordering additional servings.  The relatives with me ordered the 2 appetizer dinner for $19.99. This is perhaps the greatest deal ever. You can choose any 2 full-size appetizers, a salad, and a side dish. My relatives got different combinations of the steamed clams, mussel & clams, and calamari. These clams are the largest clams I've ever seen and are typically quite expensive, so my seafood-loving family fully enjoyed it. Did I mention the portions are super generous? If you order the mussels & clams, it comes in a delicious broth that you can dip bread into. We took home some of the leftover broth to flavor seafood dishes. The steamed clams come with a mug of warm broth (not salty, unlike the previously mentioned mussel & clam broth).   I ordered the Lake Erie Walleye and choose to have it panko-crusted. (Other options are grilled or beer-battered.) This was a huge filet, and I ended up taking half of it home! It came with a salad and a side. Pretty good deal for $23, although if you are not shellfish-averse as I am, I'd recommend the 2 appetizer dinner.   We were all super full, so dessert was out of the option. However, on my way out I saw some delicious chocolate ganache cake, red velvet cake, chocolate mousse, and cheesecake.  There is a \"no-peaking\" promotion going on right now. We got a coupon in an envelop that can be good for $5-$100 if we bring it back UNOPENED in January 2014. If you love this restaurant or if you love seafood, I'd definitely jump on that!  Overall: Pros: Fast & friendly service, GREAT quality & quantity of food, reasonable price, fun decor Cons: Steamed veggies (side dish) were a bit mushy, but nbd-- that's not what I'm here to eat, anyways. I'm am just sad that this restaurant is so far away :("}
{"text":"Delicious food. Awesome waiter. Makes you feel like your at the beach. Loved every minute of being there. I had the clam bake special. Clams. Mussels. Crab. Shrimp. Corn on cob. Andouille sausage. It was so much shared with hubby. Hubby had crabs. Delicious and fresh. We ordered the fried pickles for appetizer. They were also delicious. So glad we drove there."}
{"text":"My wife and I drove out at 4:00 on Valentine's Day. We assumed we wouldn't be seated right away because this place is always busy, but when we went to the bar to wait, we saw at least 50% of the tables unoccupied. The bar tender was cranky, but my wife liked the lemon drop martini he made for her. Once we did get seated, we were provided their Valentine's Day menu. Upon ordering the main entree from that menu, we were told it was unavailable... At 5:00. However, the waitress less us know we could order all those same items, we just couldn't get the special price. I have no idea why they even gave us that menu. Anyway, we ordered the shrimp cocktail for two with Old Bay and it was very good. I ordered two pounds of king crab legs to which the waitress said she'd put in the second pound when I was ready. When I told her I was ready, she forgot about it and we didn't feel like waiting, so we paid and left. Overall, the atmosphere is fun and the food isn't bad... They just need to get their stuff together as a whole. My wife's family is from the east coast where the seafood is amazing, so when we go back to Pickle Bill's, it will be for cocktails and appetizers... Just someplace to hang out."}
{"text":"This might possibly be the worst food I have ever paid for. Calamari and muscles literally tasted like sewage. Actually, I think the broth was made from sewage water. They use the absolute cheapest ingredients possible and can you say, \"overpriced\"! The fried bread turds left a toxic aftertaste in our mouths for hours. Just a warning to fellow Yelpers. You have been warned."}
{"text":"Quirky setting. So fun to be on the water. Food is mediocre - the fried perch and fried shrimp were too heavily breaded and overcooked. A beer batter would have been so much better."}
{"text":"This place is a disappointment. We would go here for celebrations all the time and will no longer consider this place. My lobster was cold and rubbery. My husbands crab legs were also rubbery and chewy. Horrible!"}
{"text":"This place makes you feel alittle bit like you went somewhere on vacation. Funny objects are displayed haphazardly and the nautical theme feels a bit more exotic than Mentor typically does. It's fun, you'll like it. Food is great, good quality and portions. Was there on Saturday night and it was so busy we waited 50 minutes. But it wasn't a problem, just took some drinks to the upstairs lounge and looked out over Grand River and relaxed. If you want an experience go to Pickle Bills. If you want cheap food super fast go to a chain restaurant. Honestly, I go there once a month so it obviously is a favorite!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. We hadn't been her is over 10 years so decided we would take a nice bike ride and have Fathers Day dinner. My husband loves seafood. Well we are very disappointed. The appetizer of clams and mussels were ok but the clams very sandy. I ordered all you can eat shrimp and my hubby ordered the bucket of seafood. My shrimp was over cooked and I did order the all you can eat, I had finished my fist plate and when the waitress finally showed back up to our table she was clearing stuff and then ask is there anything else she can get us? Then I think the light went off and she asked if I was ready for more shrimp, they came out pretty quick, but again over cooked. My hubby got his dinner of lobster, crab legs, clams, and mussels oh and something they called corn on the cobb (don't get it). Well all his food was nice and hot but very over cooked and water logged. The waitress didn't bring out any cracker for the crab and lobster so he had to wait and ask for some. There was more water in the lobster the meat when he cracked it open. The crab legs didn't have much meat in them. It is pretty sad the a man who isn't a Red Lobster fan tells me he would rather eat at Red Lobster then Pickle Bills. So with that said we will not be making any more 2 hour motor cycle rides to Pickle Bills."}
{"text":"In a word 'HORRIBLE!' Service at the bar was like we were invisible - hello, can we get a beer?!? Not only us, but others said the same.  Got the stuffed seafood portobello mushroom - WHAT seafood?!? The bottom part was hot and the stuffing was cold - not at all appealing. The place is filthy too! Don't go here!"}
{"text":"Great fun and wonderful atmosphere. The food was delightful and the view was great. All of the strange, eclectic nautical decor added a lot to the fun feel.  The prices were definitely strong, but if you can afford, it is worth the trip."}
{"text":"It's a good seafood place but way over priced.  And the parking is terrible. The outside bar is neat."}
{"text":"Nice floating bar and restaurant on the lake but foods n services are not impressive..I give 2* for location!!"}
{"text":"Pickle Bill's has about as much kitsch as one could possibly imagine. The entire restaurant looks like an 'I Spy' book exploded in it. Love it or hate it though, the place has charm and pretty good food to boot.   It was quite busy when I went; do yourself a favor and make a reservation if you are going during prime hours. The seafood selection is great and their sandwiches are solid too. Don't skip the fried pickles either, they are Bill's namesake for a reason!   It also has a good drink selection with many island themed drinks. I had a delicious mango margarita and my friends swear by the pomegranate mojitos.  This is a great place to go if you are in the area, do yourself a favor and stop by on a hot day after a visit to Mentor Headlands."}
{"text":"Amazing location and view of the water. Service can be a little slow sometimes, but this place is so popular, it's always packed! The food is delicious and portions are huge. This is a family favorite!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Pickle Bill's last weekend. Based on other reviews, I decided to make reservations for 6PM. We were sat rather quickly. However, it took 30 mins for someone to come and take our drink order- and this was after stopping 2 people to request a server. After placing our order for appetizers, we didn't get them for another 35 mins. My friend ordered a crab cake and that was out before my cup of soup. The rest of the meal continued to be lengthy and annoying. The service was horrible and the food was mediocre. Definitely will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Eclectic decor gives it a madcap appearance but it was clean on our visit.  Not much enthusiasm from the hostess whose function appeared to be writing the number of diners on a note and then sending them to another stop to wait for several minutes.  After being shown to our table by someone who may have been a somewhat dour manager in a tropical shirt, we again waited for several mi utes before a server noticed us.  Dederia was a spark of excitement, taking charge though it wasn't her section.  Great attitude,  very knowledgeable.   She gave us the history of the establishment and its  original location in the Flats.  Told us about the menu items and promoted the loyalty club.  She's the kind of professional you wish you could find in every restaurant.   BTW...walleye sandwich and fried pickles with custom sauces get high marks though french fries were mundane.  Homemade tartar sauce not to my liking, but used the aoioli served with the pickles and it worked.  Fried dough with cinnamon spread was a great complimentary starter.  Dessert choices appeared limited to cheesecake or key lime pie.  And given size of sandwiches, were not tempting.   Spoke with manager Andrea on our experience,  what we liked and what didn't.  - and the poor marks really only related to our initial reception and wait time.  The place should radiate more of happy party vibe from the start.  Dederia had that spirit more than the management.  Final grade----I will be back."}
{"text":"Went because my boyfriends father wanted to go for father's day while I was visiting,  would never have picked this place myself. It was just what I expected: awful.  Amanda, our server was very nice and gave us prompt service. But the list of good things about pickle bill's ends there.  The tables are dirty, the decor is too confused and awful to even be considered kitschy, and the view is terrible. I really don't understand the appeal of this place.  People really like watching geese swim past a salt mine in a dirty river? The host was also really rude and told us she didn't have our reservation written down. She did not apologize or try to fix the problem, just sent us to someone else. There's also about 20 extra servers working, just standing around with nothing to do. I even saw one applying eye drops at the servers station.   I had the grilled walleye with a salad and corn. The salad was depressing looking, drowned in dressing and cheese with 2 sorry looking tomatoes. The walleye was not fresh, and the skin stuck to the filet. It was bland and soggy. There isnt much to say about the corn. It was plain, boiled, and overcooked, but at least they didnt drown it in butter or salt.  Pickle bill's is also way overpriced. 24 bucks for a sorry piece of fish at lunch? I think I'll pass. If someone ever tried to take me here again, I'd fake a stomach bug just to avoid it. There is no way this restaurant could ever redeem itself in my eyes.  Awful. Bottom line: avoid Pickle bill's at all costs."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I come to a couple times a year when I want to feel like I'm on a mini-vaca to PIB or Chautauqua but stay close to home.  Located right on the water, dining outside gives you that experience that you're somewhere other than home without the driving distance.    So the decor is a little crazy and makes me feel a little anxiety-ridden, but once you're thrown into the thick of it, it only just adds to the quirky and fun vibe of this restaurant on the lake.  To me, the food is your typical fish-focused bar food but please don't be deceived by that statement - what I mean by that is you'll find the regular staples but the food is actually really good.  I usually do soup & salad when I dine here, but on occasion I allow myself to torture my stomach and order one of their plentiful all-you-can-eat meals (which for me us always the snow crab) - totally worth it if you can stuff your face full of enough food to get your money's worth.  I've tried some other entrees here and have always been satisfied with just about everything I've had, so rest assured that you'll get a solid meal regardless of what you order.  Pickle Bill's is also a fun place to grab a few drinks with friends - sit out on the floating bar if you want an outdoor vibe or head upstairs if you want something a little more low-key and quiet.  Either way, you'll be able to drink yourself silly at a decent price.  Beware that the parking situation gets a little crazy on weekend nights or during days when the weather is nice.  The parking lot is shared with another restaurant next door so finding a space can be difficult - and don't park in other restaurant's spaces as I've heard that they keep a pretty solid watch on who parks where.   I'll close with this - if you're looking for some good seafood related dining or a fun and/or outdoor place to eat then check out Pickle Bills."}
{"text":"I'm always one to give a place the benefit of the doubt, so after one horrible visit to Pickle Bills, I reluctantly agreed to go back when a friend decided to have a birthday dinner there. Never again. The food is awful.The drinks are awful. The service is awful. Oh and did I mention the food is awful? I don't get how anyone could want to come here. Sure, the atmosphere is kinda funky (and kinda dirty), and i'ts great being on the lake, but c'mon-nothing tasted fresh, from the seafood to the sides. I had a taste of pretty much everything our party ordered and this was true of everything. Soggy salads, watery, tasteless chowder, old tasting seafood. I am a huge seafood lover and there is no reason to sell frozen products in a restaurant that is supposed to be known for their seafood.  For the life of me, I just don't get it."}
{"text":"Terrible.  I am not sure what happened but at one point in time Pickles was the best place to visit when in the Painesville area.  Not anymore.  The prices have increased and the food has gone down.  Make sure you get a menu with the current prices because if for some reason you get a menu with the old prices, it is tough for you.  The poor waitress snatched it from my hands and told me too bad it was a mistake.  I suggest they reexamine their purpose at Pickle Bill's because obviously quality and customer service is no longer important.  Even the fried dough is not good anymore"}
{"text":"Good portions, good service for a saturday evening.  Enjoyed the perch meal and prices are decent.  Only draw back was the wait to be seated, the top bar wasnt open for waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Perch was awful, clams were sandy, waiter knew nothing. Overpriced and pretty bad = never again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both got the ayce  shrimp.  I stayed with the ever fantastic coconut shrimp and he mixed half coconut and half fried.  The coconut was the better choice (personally),we also split a side of their lobster mac and cheese which is honestly the best I've had! And if you're thinking about one of their margaritas, DO IT! their cocktails are good too,but their margaritas are tops! The waiter mark checked up on us making sure we had everything we needed, and bringing us out my shep add soon as we were ready for it.  The kitchen seemed to be really on their game, food was hot and ready shortly after we ordered, no long wait like many other restaurants.  Always happy when we go here!"}
{"text":"Great food and nice atmosphere. Tonight was best service ever from Jihan. Seated in probably 20 min and never had to wait for drinks or more crab legs to come. Food is always good but service can usually be slow but not from Jihan."}
{"text":"We were at Mentor Headlands beach on a recent Saturday afternoon with the kids, and drove past this place on the way there. I had heard of it before, and thought we'd try it out for dinner on the way back.  I called to see if they take reservations, and was told that they do but only a week in advance, but that we could come by and see how long the wait was. When we pulled into the parking lot and parked, we were told by a guy that the parking place we parked in was actually for a restaurant that was right next door to Pickle Bill's and that we'd need to go park elsewhere. Nice!  We went in a got a ticket for a table of 4, and were told the wait would be about 20 minutes. Not too bad we thought. The place was packed, lots and lots of people waiting to be seated, so we thought that's a good thing. Our 20 minute wait turned into 40 minutes, and once our ticket was called, we actually waited in line with about 20 other people to be seated, this took another 10 minutes.  The decor in this place is definitely eclectic, reminded me of a cross between a garage sale and Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville. I couldn't understand why the wait was so long because there were many, many empty tables, and it was like that the whole time we were there. My wife mentioned maybe not enough wait staff, which would make sense, but that wasn't it either because there were literally dozens of wait staff, although it did seem like not each one of them was a full-fledged wait person. Our server Kathy was good. Food was OK, but WAY OVERPRICED for what you get.   If you haven't been here before, it is worth trying just for the experience, but don't have high expectations! As mentioned before, the food is just OK, and very expensive for the quality/quantity/presentation."}
{"text":"All you can eat Crab! Easy choice. Ive been going here for 20 years.  Love the crablegs and the veiw."}
{"text":"Zany and fun atmosphere hides a fine quality restaurant.  Fine bar with plenty of selection; large menu with a crazy amount of fish and mind-boggling choice of preparations.  Red meat etc. for those who want it.  Fried dough nuggets with cinnamon butter are a tradition here; forget the diet and enjoy every bite.  We chose the fish of the day (which we had never heard of), and were happy at how good it was - meaty, light, not fishy-tasting.  You could order it one of five ways.  Side dishes were excellent, too, as was the key lime pie.  Also, great deck with lots of outdoor seating perfect for watching the boats, ducks and river action."}
{"text":"The worst clam chowder everI had better out of a can.no taste to the paste.beer was good"}
{"text":"Several friends told us we just had to go to Pickle Bills so my husband and I decided to make the long drive (over an hour) to the Restaurant thankfully we had been told to make reservations. We got seated immediately while others were told there was an hour wait. The atmosphere was fun & eclectic and the staff very friendly but we found the food to be mediocre I ordered a cheeseburger Med\well and it came very well done. Husband got the breaded walleye and was disappointed to find the skin is left on which made it a little tough to chew we did enjoy the fried dough and I found the salad very good so I can't say we won't go back but we will have to have another reason to make the trip besides just dinner to go that far again"}
{"text":"I came here because my brother brought me home some of their lobster bisque and it tasted pretty good. Very creamy with a hint of sweetness. I wish I just ordered their lobster bisque to-go instead of waiting for a table and trying more of their dishes. It was a waste of a lot of time and money.   Parking - kinda obscure. Parking is available around the restaurant building or on the other side of Brennan's restaurant and parking lot.  The wait was terrible. 1 hr 15 mins later - my party and i were seated. At such a busy restaurant, you think they would be considerate enough to put in more seating areas for waiting customers - but nope, they fill their restaurant to the brim with tacky decor. If you don't want to wait that long, then dining inside is best. Seating outside is coveted because it's on the river and very scenic.  (Went on a Friday night around 7:00 pm)  Service - really slow. After being seated, we waited 15 more minutes for a server. I ended up asking a table busser nearby for a server. Our waiter arrived and he was nice, but didn't deliver what was promised (i.e. the side dishes that are supposed to come with our entrees never showed up even though we specifically asked for them).  Then waited some more for our food. I think we started eating nearly 2 and a half hours after arriving at the restaurant.  Food - some hit and misses.    1) Lobster bisque still tasted great, but was lukewarm and the bits of lobster in the bisque were cold.   2) Bucket of clams and mussels - SALTY! I was struggling to eat them all.    3) Seafood alfredo - Salty as well! x_x If i had known that the \"Seafood\" in this dish meant that i would be getting a bunch of small shrimps and not an assortment of seafood (scallops, clams, mussels, etc.) in my pasta, I would have never ordered it. Too expensive (~$24) for the salty taste and simplicity in this dish.    4) Fries - good. nothing special.   5) Ordered the lobster and snow crab to-go and did not receive a side dish as promised by our waiter. Still upset about that since we specifically asked for a side salad and spent over $40 for this order."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review for my mother and father in law since they don't yelp. They went up to this restaurant for my mother in laws birthday today and they said it was the worse experience. They waited 45 minutes for their food and when they got their food it was cold. They sent it back to get it fixed and it came back within 5 mins which the mussels became so tough and they couldn't eat most of it. They didn't get bread and even their alcoholic drinks weren't even correct. They really were disappointed. They didn't even apologize for what happened. They would like to give 0 stars if they could but you can't. My parents of law drove 1 1/2 hours to get there."}
{"text":"Our waiter did an great job. He was friendly and dealt with the unreasonable table behind us with professionalism. The table of two behind us make at least a dozen demands for items not in the menu and special pricing. It would have been almost comical if the people weren't so rude.  For example when they demanded a plate of raw onions to be cut at their table so they could put them on their salads.  Then after they got their meals they asked for more food for free because they didn't think they got enough food. Mind you it was two people and they ordered THREE all you could eat meals.  And when it was all said and done they refused the bill and made a scene because they couldn't get free food.    Now for the important part .... the food. The hubby's lobster bisque was delicious. We ordered the deep fried pickles and they were very good.  The deep fried dough was weird. It was cold and hard. But the ducks and geese loved it.  The Alaskan Snow Crab legs were really good and the portion was large. The fried shrimp was a large portion and was not overly fried.   Overall the food was very good. The service was decent. We were impressed with our server keeping his composure. I feel like our service could've been better if our server wasn't constantly being called to the table behind us for their constant demands. The manager should've stepped in at some point.  The situation was distracting to other diners and put the waiter in a crappy position."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to go here for more than year now, and I must say, I was kind of disappointed. While the atmosphere was nice, and I loved being able to sit out on the water with a nice breeze on a sunny day, the food was just OK. I got a pound of crab legs with a side salad and some corn on the cob. The corn cooled down fast, which I expected, and the side salad was standard. I was super disappointed with the crab legs though ... the meat was tough. I've just had better. Our service was great though, and the restaurant was decorated really unique. I recommend getting there early (we got there at 5) because it really started to pick up and was packed by the time we left around 630."}
{"text":"I've wanted to eat here for a long time. It's unique with the nautical decor but the good leaves much to be desired. I ordered the perch sandwich. As in other reviews the pan co breading is too much for a delicate fish. Could not taste anything but the breading and the onion in the tarter sauce. Brennan's across the street was busier which generally means it's the preferred place. If you do decide to eat at Bills, take a wheelbarrow to the bank first to pay for dinner. It's OVER priced."}
{"text":"Pickle Bills is my go to spot whenever I'm craving fresh seafood and a unique outdoor dining experience that makes me feel like I'm not in Ohio. The stuffed shrimp and muscles are both amazing. My boyfriend loves the seafood platter because it allows him to try a variety of foods in one meal. The key lime pie for dessert (if you have room in your tummy after the meal) is also a must!"}
{"text":"We scheduled my birthday dinner here 3 days in advance. When we got there right on time the hostess told us it would be a 15 minute wait. We waited half hour. And everytime I would check in with her she said it would be another 15 minutes. Ruined my birthday. Too bad this was one of my favorite restaurants, I won't be coming back. I wish I could give 0 stars."}
{"text":"If the food at Pickle Bill's was served anywhere else, I'd call it overpriced and unmemorable. BUT the atmosphere, location and service make it shine.  Food: Think fish any way you want it, pasta, fried anything, etc. I got the fried perch sandwich and liked it, but wasn't overly impressed.   Location: The kind of beachfront dining you'd expect in the Carolinas. A real treat to experience anything like it here in NEO. I could literally feel my blood pressure drop just walking up to the entrance.  Atmosphere: Quirky and a little off-color (I was waiting for my 3-year-old to ask why the guy on the bathroom wall was wearing leafy underwear) but still slightly upscale. Airy and open and wonderfully vacation-like. A magician and balloon artist even stopped by our table while we waited for our food. (PSA: He makes amazing monkeys.)  Would I go back? Heck yeah! Already planning our next visit."}
{"text":"Yelp help me find this place after visiting squires castle. I loved it as soon as I saw it. It made me feel like I wasn't in Ohio, as soon as you walk in there's a million things to look at, decked out in the most random of decor. The wait was a little long but that's a given on a Saturday evening. We were seated in a small booth close to the outside with an awesome view of the water and floating bar that looks like a carousel. Our waitress (Angie) was awesome and a hoot! Loved their drink menu and great appetizers to choose from! My fella and I both got the lobster which was delicious. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. It's always been one of my kids' fav restaurants. The 1st table we were seated at was dirty. My mom put her hand on the table and there was grease all over it. The hostess came to seat us at a new table. She bypassed the table behind us because it was clearly dirty too. The 3rd table looked okay except when I picked up my appetizer plate I had to pull it hard because it was sticking to the table. When my mom put her hand on her chair it was sticky. Plus the restaurant just smelled bad. Like a stale smell. My youngest son kept going out to the deck to get away from the bad smell. It was just very dirty and rundown looking.  As for the food, the mussels were salty and my Lobster Bisque was lukewarm at best. Best thing about the meal was the bread dough and cinnamon butter. Service was ok.  Unfortunately, the food is expensive and not worth going back for. Sadly, this was our last visit to Pickle Bill's"}
{"text":"I've stopped at Pickle Bill's a few times when I'm visiting from out of town. I wouldn't say I've ever had a bad experience, but my experiences have been mediocre. This place is well known in the community. The inside of the restaurant is very visual. A lot of decor and things to look at. It kind of reminds me of a restaurant you'd find at an amusement park (not that that's a bad thing). They have a pretty decent menu. Moderately priced. Lots of seafood to choose from. This last time I went I got the perch sandwich. My coworkers got a steam pot of various seafood. And they bring you free fried dough bites. I didn't have any but my coworker said they're pretty dense. I don't have a lot of 'great' things to say about Pick Bills, but i don't think it's awful. But don't just take my word for it, stop in yourself and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here this past weekend for some seafood. He is a West Sider so I wanted to show him a good time on the east side. I chose the wrong place. We had originally planned to go to Brennans across the street but once we say the floating big top circus tent bar in the back we went here instead. The wait was 1.5 hours. Ugh really!?!? We figured time would fly if we had a few drink a the bar out back. People (rich old white men) can dock their boats at the back to stop in for a drink or dinner. The bar had great service and the crowd was funny but highly intoxicated, loud, and seemed to be in some kind of contest on who could ring up the largest tab. It was really kind of like a display or wealth with lots of shots bought for everyone, bragging about their boats, and parading around their plastic blonde aging wives. So they zipped up, put away their measuring sticks, and left. So people watching is by far the best part of Pickle Bills.  I had been to this place since I was kid. Prior to the arson/insurance ploy/oh lord jesus it's a fire! Finally got seated and our hostess Leah was awesome. She was honest, attentive, and charming. She warned me don't order the small plates or you will end up weeping over a $16 petri dish sized serving of lobster mac and cheese. I order the entree size. So we sat and waited for our meals and was served their fried dough and cinnamon butter. Which was tasty but the dough was really too dense and  the recipe could use some tweaking.   Was brought out my ceasar salad which was the best part of the meal. I really liked it. We also had the crab stuffed portobello as an ap. Which was good but the stuffing didn't have much crap and was really a can of tuna over a mushroom cap hidden under the glob of melted cheese. I hate fish so I didn't like it. It was kind of cold and flakey and flavorless. Entre came and it was pretty bland and had virtually no lobster and cost about $20. The thing about the food is damn near everything is fried or loaded with cheese. A more skilled cook would take a better approach with grilling, better seasoning, and using fresh fish. Frying is easy, fast, and not innovative. Try harder.  I was very pleased with the service and the river side location. I was not pleased with the very overpriced and underwhelming food. It is not worth the cost to go to Pickle Bills. The decor is sensory overload with manikins and tackle everywhere. It's really over done. Also this place is dirty. Like I was stuck to my seat of  rotted spraypainted upcycled pallet wood bench dirty. It's dusty and needs a thorough power washing. Or better yet set the place on fire (again) collect the insurance money (again) and start over from scratch."}
{"text":"The tables are all sticky, the burning of dead bodies smell in the bathroom is nauseating, my dish came out with a 20 oz of oil/water mixture, cant order grilled shrimp separately, and more"}
{"text":"Super quirky restaurant. The service was excellent and the food was really good. I can't wait to come back in the summer."}
{"text":"Had a great boiled seafood plate, worth the price and awesome decorations. Great service and cool fried bread roles!"}
{"text":"Apparently they don't always take reservations. When they decide to go \"on a wait\" they won't take a reservation, even if you have a large party."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was FUN! Sit outside on the patio overlooking the water! Service was good, and prices were comparable! Everyone enjoyed their Crab, burgers, coconut shrimp and fried dough balls! Also, get the deep fried pickles, they were awesome! Everyone in our group had a fun experience here!"}
{"text":"Fun and relaxing atmosphere. We sat on deck to watch boats. Fortunately it wasn't busy so service was not slow as I feared from other reviews. Fried pickles were good but not better than other restaurants. I had Panko breaded perch and the breeding was so heavy. I wish they did pan-fried. The calamari was better than most places. Their spicy sauce is super mild. Probably won't rush back as price is not worth the 45 minute drive as well as not having above average food quality. Perch shouldn't be $22+."}
{"text":"Terrible! I wish I could give them zero out of five.  Frozen fresh! Freezer burn seafood isn't what I ordered but what I got. Lobster bisque was horrible. I would suggest grab some McDonald's instead and head to the river. At least u would save money and have better quality food."}
{"text":"Pickle Bill's has a great environment! We took a nice boat ride here for some lunch, drinks and laughs. You can sit right on the water and enjoy the scenery. The fried pickles and pina coladas are amazing! Plus you get to keep your cup :)"}
{"text":"Finally visited Pickle Bills, after hearing from a friend who lives near there said he liked it.  Drove nearly an hour to surprise wife, thought it would be fun.  Four o'clock on a Saturday, only 15 minute wait for outside table. Not too busy,  tried to get a drink at inside bar while waiting for table, could never get bartender to serve us, though only four other patrons were at the bar. Arrived at our table outside, served a glob of dough with cinnamon butter, no utensils. Ordered bottled beer with frosted glass, got small glass, would only chill half of beer. Wife ordered two 5oz lobster tails, liked them and the salad but, the green beans were awful, bland and greasy. I ordered the King Crab legs. Big mistake. No different than the snow crabs that the table next to us were eating .Tasty, but rip off. Terrible wait service although the waitress said she and another waitress would be taking care of us.  Never checked with us, waited fifteen minutes for another drink to come. Both seemed to spend all their time with another table. I normally tip 20 to even 40 percent, on this occasion, I couldn't find it to leave a tip at all (on a $99.93 tab). I have never done it before, but have never been as disappointed with service like this.  We talked about going to Delmonico's in Independence, about the same price, except excellent service and quality. I have never left a restaurant after spending nearly $100 for two, and still have been hungry.  If ever in the neighborhood again, will go to Brennen's across the street. Spoke with their customers on their way in, all insisted I should have went there instead. Good advice."}
{"text":"Ok so my moms 69th birthday was today and we decided to drive 45 minutes out from Bedford hts. To have seafood and steak. Four adults and one child. We all ordered steak and prime rib medium well. When the steaks came back they were over cooked. We sent two back. And one steak came back to us. A Waiter who was not our waiter told us that the cook said that they cook the one steak right. Said they had a disclaimer and would not remake a steak. I asked to speak to the manager. He came and told us \"why does this steak keep coming back.\" He was none accommodating and was defensive. I told him that I would buy another steak just make another steak. It was as if he was prepared to deal with us or (handle us). The waitress keep apologizing for bad service. It was a waste of space! Need a new floor manager ASAP! Still tipped 15% because the waitress was not responsible for bad cooks and manager."}
{"text":"Poor service and low quality food.  We went on a Tuesday night when it was not busy.  We waited an hour and 20 minutes for two hamburgers and one piece of fish.  When we questioned our server about the delay, she responded that her computer was frozen up and she couldn't use any other computer to enter our order.  I guess the old fashioned way of speaking to the chef directly is too much of a chore. When our food arrived we could tell that our meals had come straight from the microwave.  Do yourself a favor and eat at the fine restaurant across the street.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Well I haven't been here in a few years, but one thing I did remember is that it was one of my favorite places to go growing up, so I was extremely excited to go back and dig in. Needless to say the excitement turned in extreme disappointment... Just to make a quick review, EVERYONE working there clearly hated their job(and it showed in the food & service) -They haven't updated anything in that restaurant in 20 years(original is nice, but not in their case) -for the quality of food you are not getting what you pay for(paying legitimate seafood restaurant prices for Long John Silver quality) -Mr. Bill definitely cut back on the quality of food and it's chef's. What used to be a fun place to be turned just another run down over the hill restaurant on the water.... So long Pickle Bills. Hope the next owner can revive this establishment."}
{"text":"Food is always the same. Never great but cost is high. However, you can't beat the view. Best restaurant view in Lake County. FYI, they are known for their crab legs, which are good. But, as of today, its $48.95 for all you can eat - which is insane."}
{"text":"I haven't been in here in a couple years, but my first trip here started with the fried bread with cinnamon butter, which tasted amazing. After that, it only got better. The fried pickles were great, my steak was cooked to perfection and the lobster mashed potatoes were outstanding. The service was a bit slow but the appetizers made that bearable."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Oysters on the half shell looked like they were shucked a week ago.  Did not even touch them.  This place has seen it's better days.  Don't even waste your time."}
{"text":"The food is so good the customer service is good too. Nice atmosphere not too loud. Many all you can eat specials prices are average compared to most seafood restaurants. Hostess was really nice"}
{"text":"This place in the 80's was the cats meow! Since then a hand full of visits just shows how much it has changed, they took the quality away and replaced it for quick serve premade seafoods. Crab legs are soggy, cold and soft shelled like they reheated the day before left overs. The prime rib back in the day came out freshly cooked juicy and well seasoned, now it is a pre cooks vacuumed packed from a food supply company.  Why so many places go this way is beyond me all it takes is a kitchen team dedicated to quality and keeping them happy to put out real fresh cooked in house dishes. We need a real seafood place in this town like the old days"}
{"text":"Atmosphere - Someone said this below, and I totally agree: I make the trek east to Pickle Bill's about once a summer, usually after a day at Mentor Headlands or the beach in Fairport Harbor, when I want to feel like I'm on vacation without leaving home. Pickle Bill's sits right on the water complete with floating bar and plentiful outdoor seating. The decor is crazy, for lack of a better word. Come here with an open mind! I never feel out of place with just a bathing suit and cover up on, PB's is very casual.  Food - I don't know remember how the prices are, but the food is GREAT! The warm fried dough with cinnamon butter is amazing. I always get the snow crab legs and they are always good. Everyone else I've eaten with has been happy with their food as well.  Overall, this is a fun, quirky seafood restaurant that should be a summer-staple if you live in the Cleveland area. Expect a wait for dinner on weekends."}
{"text":"Good food. Fun environment. Would have been great for all / including kids if not for smokey Jane next to us. We have 3 small children (including an infant) and in between her all you can eat crab plates she was cranking butts like we were in a scene of Mad Men. I get it/ we were on the porch (though outside). But we were NOT at the bar. I think it says something of a restaurant that allows the discomfort and inconvenience of all of it's patrons. We are eating dinner. Totally ruined it.   I would possibly go again cause the food was good (we had the bucket of shellfish) & kids meals were priced well but we'd have to eat inside to avoid the possibility of madness."}
{"text":"Pickle Bills is a nice place to head after a day at the Beach either Mentor Headlands or Fairport harbor. It is on the pricier side because shipping fresh seafood into Ohio is probably no easy task.  On weekends there are crowds so pick your time wisely. They also have a boat dock for you boaters and/or pirates.  It's decor is anything but subtle. Rainbow colors everywhere, mannequins dressed as pirates peppered about the restaurant, and these psychedelic illustrations all over the walls . It honestly looks like a Dead Heads Dream or the set from Laugh In.    The place is cheesy but original. So an unabashedly cheesy time with great food awaits and, after 40 years, it's a certifiable institution.  I went there last night for my girlfriend's b-day. She had the King Crab, Large portions steamed and served with a pair of scissors to cut through the giant shell. They were actually very helpful.  I had the fillet mignon with a side of crab legs. It was served with lobster mashed potatoes and salad. My girlfriend had the coleslaw which tasted heavy on the horse radish. The fillet was over cooked but it was still good. They have a warning about their steaks on their menu and I guess, after my experience it means they tend to cook higher on the chain. My crab legs were good though a little mossy and with some barnacles. Though it's Ohio so ... come on.  They still serve their  fried dough and cinnamon butter rolls but they stopped serving their dipping butter with the candles. Also, their Diet Pepsi is an off off brand. My GF said it tasted really bad.   Overall I had a very enjoyable time and would recommend you try it out."}
{"text":"Pickle Bill's is seriously the best place around this part of town to get all-you-can-eat crab legs! I come here every single summer and cannot wait to come back here again this summer.   The crab legs are fantastic, the wine is delicious and affordable and the vegetables/side dishes are always served hot. Oh and you can't forget the doughy bread that they give you with cinnamon butter! It's out of this world.   I'd say be sure to take your friends here on their birthday. They sing for them and give them an awesome mini cake!"}
{"text":"Wife I and about 20 friends had a wonderful time here not one person had a complaint I had walleye and the wife had perch, Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! Hot and fresh and the dirty rice was awesome.The wait staff were Great took care of our every need and we put them to work but they did their job with a smile. I so look forward to going back especially when the patio is opened up!!"}
{"text":"Stopped off yesterday afternoon for dessert and the staff was awesome!  Quickly put together seating for eight by the water.  Brad, our waiter, was great.  Really enjoyed it there.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"After an hour by boat from Cleveland, hunger sets in. We had a 20 minute wait, many tables were open which did not make sense. After a cold beer, which is why the 2 stars, we inquired about our table - just a minute was our response. 10 minutes later we were seated.   We ordered the lake perch - and while our waiter tried to steer us away from the heavily panko crusted lake perch, we ordered anyway - mistake.  4 pieces of fish, good Cole slaw and cold French fries. I scraped off the heavy breaking and ate three of the Luke warm fish all of the Cole slaw and a couple of the fries.  I have never left perch uneaten on a plate.   So sad to see them go this far from eatable. I did not even turn in my frequent dining card for points as I don't think I will be back - cold, nasty fish, Luke warm fries - but the beer was cold and we had fun getting there.   Recommendations- go somewhere else. Sorry pickle bills -"}
{"text":"Wow! Never a disappointment!! Service is always phenomenal and the food is awesome. Fun place to eat with lots of cool decor. They have this amazing $40 deal which included an appetizer, bottle of wine, and main course. We added a lobster tail. Crab legs are amazing. I tried the Panko breaded Lake Erie perch which was light and tasty. The fried dough with cinnamon butter is one of our favorite things to eat. Seriously? Cinnamon and butter?!?! Love this place! We drive almost an hour from Twinsburg to eat here!"}
{"text":"1. We got fried dough and cinnamon butter for a free appetizer! So far great start!   The place is so interesting inside. Right on the lake! So beautiful.   Lobster Mac n cheese was great. So much I could only eat half.  Shared some of the local battered fish which was exceptionally battered and fried.  I very much enjoyed my time."}
{"text":"Holly crabs Batman!!!! Went here for the first time place was packed but it did not effect the speed of service or food quality. My 10 year old son got the kids prim rib and it was a 10 oz of goodness cooked right and tender. I got the all you can eat crab and let m tell you I never had to wait for a refill it was always their when I was cracking the last leg. I will go back"}
{"text":"Very nice! The staff was great, lots of room, in or outside. Good Food."}
{"text":"Despite being on the shores of Lake Erie, there aren't many waterfront restaurants in northeastern Ohio. Pickle Bill's is on the western bank of the Grand River with outside seating on the waterfront. Sadly, that's about the only distinction this restaurant can claim.  Pricing is a little high but not unreasonable. The food is OK; many restaurants in the region have far better seafood. I had deep fried shrimp and, though the portions were of average size, the shrimp themselves were on the small side. I'm not a fan of the decor but that's not a deal breaker by any means.  The service was somewhat disappointing. It started with having to wait 10 to 15 minutes for a table. I'm OK with that until you walk into the dining area and see multiple vacant tables in the section you're seated. Pickle Bill's also has this process where the staff at the front hosting station directs you to stand in the middle of the doorway to the dining room to wait a few more minutes to be seated. You're left standing in the direct path servers must take to and from the kitchen. I bet they just love that. Our server provided adequate service but it must have been towards the end of a long day for her. At least I hope that was the case because neither friendly nor congenial are words I would use to describe her.  If you're expecting 'wow', forget it. That ship set sail long ago. If you're looking for 'It's close, we can sit outside by the water, and it's not terrible', then Pickle Bill's fits the bill."}
{"text":"Went last week nothing like places that serve prime rib they bought already cooked from their food service company.  Who buys prime rib already cooked like deli meats !!   Then continue to bring cold or still frozen cab legs.  They really need to put some love in what they serve or hire people with confidence to cook fresher food not frozen and pre made."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere. An eccentric artist was definitely involved in the decor. It reminds me of the house on the rock in Wisconsin by the artist's style. It may creep you out though if you had a few too many and sit down by one of the crazy manikin pairs.   An added bonus for me... my toddler could feed the geese leftover bread that they left out... great way of keeping him entertained while everyone is finishing up!   It's my first trip there. Definitely a great place to eat after a day at the beach. We had lunch sandwiches which were awesome! Perch and chicken sandwich with a really great honey mustard sauce.  We went at about 3:00 on a Monday of a holiday weekend and there was no wait."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. We don't have many restaurants on the water and it looks like places in North Carolina or Florida which makes me feel like I'm on vacation.. but we did not like it. Food was very mediocre. It was too expensive for the quality you get. The only thing which was good was lobster bisque"}
{"text":"This place was great, had a beer battered fish dinner, very good, little pricey but worth the drive."}
{"text":"I do not do fish, rather we went there for my wife, the fish lover's, bday.    Her lobster, she said, tasted like it's been in the tank a while.   The kids' meals could have easily been split between the two of them.  My hamburger was cooked to order, was hot and fresh.  We had a trainee server and she did well.  They did bring a small bday cake, gratis, which was a nice surprise!  This is my first review of PB.  Lighting and decor is kind of trashy...but i did like the meal.   Prices were in line with the area as well."}
{"text":"This place is awful. The lobster bisque was served cold. The corn was a mutant. The fish bony as hell. Just awful."}
{"text":"Great dinner there last night!   Crab legs were amazing!!!!   Emily was our server and she was so much fun!!!  Everything could have been terrible but she would have saved the experience just by being her.  Our bill was ~$189 and we left her $100 tip....because she deserved it!   Keep up the great food and awesome hires."}
{"text":"Not sure why some posted negative reviews of this place because it is on point. My girlfriend and I had dinner there last night, with reservations set for 6 p.m., were seated by 6:05. Our server William was awesome, was fast, attentative and really was one of the best servers we've encountered and we dine out a lot. We both ordered all you can eat crab legs and they were fresh, hot and delicious. I do feel the sticker price was high but we must have had 5 buckets each so it equates to 10 bucks a pound.   The only negative I did feel could be addressed is the tables are made of some type of epoxy resin so being outside, May be melting or something because there was a sticky residue on the table top. I just played a napkin over it so it was acceptable.   My girlfriend and I will definitely be returning to pickle bills, we had a fantastic evening. Last thing to note, the service was great even though the place was packed!"}
{"text":"Pickle Bill's is one of my favorite places . I always get the all your can eat crablegs. It's a bit pricey but it is definitely worth it.  They come out by the pound and each bucket is perfect. The staff is always on it. The best time of year to go is in the summer time so you can sit out on the deck by the water.   One thing I will say is that everything else on the menu is kinda mediocre. The shrimp and fish are okay.  I would not recommend it to someone one who doesn't eat crablegs.  But if you do you'll love it."}
{"text":"Happy to see they were open on a Monday.  The family was a little bummed out when they saw the reduced menu. The parents liked the shrimp cocktail. Thankfully the Whiskey Island chicken is still available. Yes I know, ordering chicken at a seafood joint is blasphemy. So sue me.  Service was top notch. Lyssi was the name of our server. Took time to interact with each person at the table including my little nephews. Had our drinks out right away. Loaded us up with those awesome corn rolls/muffins. Even laughed at my horribly bad jokes."}
{"text":"Are you sure we're not in Put-n-Bay?   Because it looks an awful lot like it--well, with all this kitschy island and tropical decor, it might as well be there. And it's put on thick, people. Not a thin layer here. But it's to such a random level that it's more like a PIB restaurant on speed. None of what you see will seem normal.   And hey--it's exactly what I remember from childhood and I love it! Well, I could do without those tripped out mannequins, sitting at a random table.   I won't review the food since I haven't had it in the past 10 years, but the vibe is this place is a blast. Swings at the bar, roof top patio with a stage, tons of dock space and, yes, a floating bar. You'll pay a premium for the cocktails, but the atmosphere is worth it. In fact, you won't have the same experience anywhere.   It's really a bummer that this place isn't busier--then again we were there at an off time. Yet, this spot has been a beachside staple for as long as I can remember. It's survived some rough times and I hope it continues to. In fact, I'm actually kind of excited to make my way back over there for some crab legs and drinks on the dock."}
{"text":"Used to be a great place. Menu changed. Many favorites gone. They don't even have fish and chips any longer. Food cold tonight. The only thing good here are the servers and view. Such a disappointment. Last time here."}
{"text":"way overrated, owner and manager have a seriously lousy attitude. Overpriced for sure. Bumpers is the place to go for the crab legs, not mushy like Pickle Bills. They have the river right outside the place so they feel they can justify the increased pricing."}
{"text":"It's never a good when you leave a place hungry and spend $70 not including drinks. I could stop there.   Service: the server had a little attitude and seemed uninterested. The place wasn't very busy but I would say it was half full. The server started off a little slow. When ordering I asked for the unlimited Lake Erie walleye grilled. (I didn't feel like fried) my wife ordered the 1 lb lobster. I asked how many tails come with it approximately and she said 1 or 2. (I figured that meant 1) so we all ordered and when the food came is when the chaos started. They had no idea what was what and who ordered it. No big deal. However my walleye came out as fried. When I told them I asked for grilled the server came back with grilled walleye and said \"when you order unlimited it comes fried but it will be grilled for the first.\" I thought she would tell me what when I ordered. So I told her I'll just take the single meal then because I didn't want anything fried. So she fixed that.   When my wife's meal came out I was an entire lobster. We were expecting lobster tail. So maybe we don't know what we are doing but it was our first time there. The menu didn't clearly say what we would get and the server didn't clear my thinking when I asked about lobster tail.  After the meal we waited about 20 minutes for checks and we thought she left. We were with a group of 8 and the family that brought us loves the place and they apologized over and over saying they never had service or food thus bad. I never tip less than 20% I tipped less than 15% .  Food: My walleye was a normal size. There was a ton of small bones in it. I don't care if there are a couple but I couldn't get one bite without bone. That sure was a let down. The taste was just okay, Nothing fancy. Learn to filet a fish and feel for bones. I can do it better myself.   My wife's lobster was good but just upsetting that she didn't ask what we want. She didn't like the tomalley.  Overall  My bill was almost $70 including one glass of wine before tip. My fish was $24. I wasn't even half full. Total rip off. I will not be back! My wife wasn't full either. Terrible service sub par food. The place could also do a remodel. I felt like I was in a place that could be on kitchen nightmares. I mean the naked women things all over. Sorry I'm upset. But I got ice cream after and I'm still craving Taco Bell. They get one star because the food and service disappointed me and the bill was way too much for what we got."}
{"text":"Where else can you get all you can eat lobster? Sure, its $150, but for true fans, a steal. Pickle Bill's is about seafood. Sure, they dabble in other courses, but seafood is their bread and butter. The all you can eat deals are among the best around, and most priced under $30 (and + $2 to add a second one). The place is quirky/campy at its highest art form and the food is good to boot. And don't miss out on the rolls."}
{"text":"Although expensive, I think this place is great and have never had a bad meal, plus I enjoy the eclectic crazy decorations. The lobster soup, green beans, lobster mac & cheese, the rolls with butter, calamari, are all really good. But probably the best thing is the all you can eat shrimp special. Sooo much food!"}
{"text":"Seating not a problem. We sat outside under the awning where flies bite you occasionally, but we got over that. Service was fast, but server should bring more items at once rather than make so many trips. No Music...though speakers are hung. Lots of jet skis and sailboats going by. Salad just ok. Cole slaw fresh and good. Fried dough ok but just \"junky.\"  Lobster mac n cheese just ok and no salad included(?). Lacked flavor. Seafood sampler just ok. With panko you can't taste the fish. Prefer beer batter. Pricing seems high for level of satisfaction. We figure there are better places. In fact we know it. Guess we're done here."}
{"text":"Hair in the food. Raw food. Crab leg jerky. Servers who hide. An awful experience in all respects. Will not ever go back..."}
{"text":"We tried to make the best of it, so I can't say it was an entirely bad experience, but I can't really think of anything good to say except that our server was nice and she was trying. Buuuut, she wasn't a good server. Service was so incredibly slow and I don't feel she did her best to make up for the problems we had. I guess my one other compliment would be that the clam chowder was decent. Waited a while to be seated because kitchen was backed up (we overheard). For starters, the fried pickles were gross. That's a bad sign, considering the name of the restaurant and all. Couldn't finish them. Had that cheap-tasting, thick breading. Anyone from the South would be appalled by these monstrosities. Fried perch was cold. We complained (and we are not complainers). They threw it back in the fryer. To be fair, I'm thinking that I generally don't like fried fish anymore, however, I still think these things were flavorless and subpar. My margarita was all sour mix. I asked for another shot of tequila and it tasted like a normal margarita. Still was charged, though. Tasted my gf's crab legs. Not bad. Tasted the kiddo's french fries. Cold and soggy. Oh, and the hostess was like an exaggerated character from a movie, not giving a flying f and truly unfriendly. Wouldn't matter, but we had to sit there and watch her for 20 minutes. Lastly, we got the bill. We could've gone to a really good restaurant with those prices! Yes, you get a little view of the boats coming in, but will never come back here."}
{"text":"So sad...I grew up going to this place. It was \"the\" seafood destination for my friends and I. The all-u-can eat was hands down the best around AND at a reasonable price. MUCH has changed...The service was sub par, at best. They have DOUBLED the price of the all-u-can eat crab legs. Its $60 & the quality has also gone down hill a little bit. One of my buddies ordered (can't remember name) a seafood \"feast\" with crab legs, lobster, clams, muscles, etc...I have NEVER seen such small clams before! My buddy made a comment to the server, not really complaining, more just bustin' his chops. The server said \"you want to to complain to the kitchen?\" My buddy asked what good that would do. The server then told him \"when people complain they just give stuff...\" My buddy nodded his head. The server acted like nothing was ever said and never brought it up the rest of the time. It was ridiculous! I had the all-u-can eat crab along w/ ribs. The rib meat was ok, but they use waaaaay too much cumin in their seasoning. I smelled cumin the next day still! Another small thing that irritated me was I wanted a baked sweet potato, which was not on the regular menu, but was included in their \"bake\" selections. I asked for the swap and told my server I would pay extra. They flat out refused, saying they had to hold onto the sweet potatoes for their bakes. It was 8:30 on a Thursday night and there were 3 other tables dining. I find it hard to believe they didn't have 1 extra sweet potato! Since this is a drive from where I stay when in the Cleveland area, I will NOT be going back there to eat. Grand River is still a great place to visit and there are plenty of other establishments in the area to explore. Like I said when I stated...so sad. Only memories left of Pickle Bill's now..."}
{"text":"Place is fun and eclectic BUT the food was terrible. The lobster tail was smothered in paprika! The stuffed shrimp was smothered as well and was mushy! Lobster bisque was cold! WE GOT PICKLED!!! And paid a fortune for louzy food!!"}
{"text":"We have always liked Pickle Bills, but we know exactly what to expect and are seldom surprised. The food is consistently good. Sitting out by the river is fun. The kids always like feeding the ducks. And last and certainly least the service is mediocre to poor, but it is consistent. Last night was no different. The waitress was hurried taking care of two tables and had to be chased down for refills. We got curt answers to any inquiries and that was that.   Will we go back? Yep, but like South West Airlines, we know what to expect going in."}
{"text":"I would normally never go to a restaurant with this many poor reviews but we were invited to a family dinner and plans were already in place. The only reason I gave two stars was the great location on the water. The food was not good at all. Six of us and not one person was happy with their meal. Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"First time there, had a really nice meal on the patio. Server Brian was new, very attentive & honest. Got shrimp & mussel & clam bucket for apps, both very good. BF got red snapper blackened, fish was fresh & cooked well. Got an extra piece of walleye fried which was great. I got clam chowder which was watery not great, but my crab cake was fantastic. And the lobster mac & cheese was to die for! So creamy and flavorful! So we ate a ton of food, had a relaxing meal, great view, water birds are built-in entertainment, I liked the old timey nautical decor. Would recommend and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Great food. Swordfish was awesome and there fried dough and cinnamon butter is the best! Our server was fantastic too, he never let a cup run dry."}
{"text":"Expensive but well worth it - especially for special occasions.  Soup is to die for.... food is flavored and prepared well.    Nothing bad to say - wish they didn't leave the Belly program."}
{"text":"On Saturday had a decent meal at an expensive price the manager in the wait staff were incredibly rude and I witnessed an incident where they discriminated against a disabled veteran they don't seem to like disabled veterans for some strange reason"}
{"text":"Horrible. Went to eat here, online the time said they opened at 2:00 we show up about 2:15 and there is a sign on the door saying they don't open till 3:00 but online it still says you can eat on the barge starting at 12:00. Walked in the place was dirty and disgusting.  The owners were so rude when we asked what time they open and told them online it said differently. I would NEVER attempt to eat there again. Instead we went to Brennan ' s across the street."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a casual place to sit outside in the summer and have a drink, we enjoyed our visit to the floating bar at Pickle Bills. While the restaurant is open year round, the outdoor bar is only seasonal and actually has a separate menu. This review is only for the seasonal floating bar.  This arc shaped bar with attached benches floating on the Grand River lent itself to the casual social environment of a laid back summer night. On a nice night, you'll see multiple boats entering and exiting out to Lake Erie. The surrounding industry is slightly distracting from the ambiance, but overall, it's just nice to have an option to sit out on the water.   The service we received from the staff was friendly and conversational. The other patrons, for the most part, were courteous and mature. The food menu was very basic and more or less just options to snack while drinking. Nothing looked the least bit interesting to bother ordering. The beer wine and liquor menu was shorter than if you'd sat inside, but it was adequate and the prices were acceptable for the overall casual environment.   I'd like to return to eat at the restaurant and be able to review the food. As of now, this is a nice spot to sit out and have a drink on the water in lake county!"}
{"text":"Update 8-4-14:  Following my review, I was contacted by Pickle Bill management and offered a gift certificate in light of my negative review. Despite providing my contact info as requested by Pickle Bill Management, I have yet to receive anything in the mail.  Apparently, their promise to \"make things right\" was a hollow one.  It is now clear how an incompetent manager and wait staff could be hired and remain employed. Adding insult to a bad dining experience results in further disappointment."}
{"text":"Saturday night out with my family we decided to go to Pickle Bills.  We expected to wait knowing it was going to be the dinner rush (6:30pm). We where told 1 hour wait. We sat on the upper deck to watch the boats.  A little over 1 hour we checked with the front desk who said another 20 minutes. We contimpeplated leaving but thought driving to another restaurant and possibly having a wait  there so we stayed (we should have left).  Went to the bar to get a drink and waited 15 minutes, money in hand, waiving to bartender until I finally walked away.  They called our number almost 2 hours into our wait only to order prime rib what we had been waiting for and to be told they where out!  We have visited Pickle Bills time and time again and  I'm sad to say we won't be back to visit for a very very long time due to this horrible experience!  What a waste of time and money! Shame on you @picklebills"}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite seafood restaurant! The decor is bright and fun, the food is delicious and not as expensive as you might think. It's definitely the best \"all you can eat\" restaurant that we have found!"}
{"text":"Our first visit & will go back! The restaurant is filled with funky memorabilia for a whimsical atmosphere-fun. There is a large patio area & another covered area with a overhead round tent-like roof. Looked like a carousel. Sat down & the waitress brought a basket of warm fried dough balls & cinnamon butter-very tasty. Lobster bisque soup-good. Lobster-good. Broiled seafood platter-good. The place was hopping & the wait staff did a great job. This is a fun place---worth a visit."}
{"text":"Never a disappointment!!! The best all you can eat crab legs around.  The all you can eat shrimp is fantastic as well.  A special occasion must. Go early or plan to wait.  The fried buns with cinnamon butter are always good but don't fill up on them as they are heavy.  Well worth the hour drive to get there.  Pricey but worth it if you have a big appetite. The resturant offers views of the grand river."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Ordered ayce crab legs for 3 and the table was kept well stocked with good size well steamed crab legs. Waitress kept coming by and asking if we needed more crab and delivered them promptly. Drinks were well made and made as requested, dirty vodka martini and margaritas. Appetizers were hot and tasty. Fried pickles and potato skins. I recommend skipping the apps and going straight to the crab legs. We took most of the extra sides and the apps home. Also you might want to skip the drawn butter since the crab legs tasted great without the butter. Will go back once we digest this latest trip!"}
{"text":"Went here after a fun and beautiful day at Mentor Headlands with family. We just wanted a drink and snacks. The back deck sitting on the water was a perfect ending to the day. My sister also discovered as we were leaving that they had a upstairs deck with live music, so we will be back to check that out and the food!! (heads up not sure if they take reservations, but make them, there was a fairly long line of people waiting to eat)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for all ages, staff friendly and always available, food was good. My kids 7 & 9 enjoyed themselves and is BIG KIDS enjoyed the decor. Will go back again"}
{"text":"UGH! I really didn't enjoy this place. I could go on for two pages of things I hated but I'll stick to the most important items. First, they are not a very clean place. They have crap all over the walls that hasn't been dusted in years. Although the service wasn't bad I had something take place that really grossed me out. My girlfriend ordered the crab legs and we noticed the waitress was clearing our table and taking parts off crab legs over to the server station where she would pull any remaining crab meat off and eat it. Like I said I was really grossed out by this and it really got me thinking about what else goes on in this place. I ordered the prime rib and it was anything but prime. To top everything off this place was pricey and quality was very low. I've given this place three chances and I will not be returning for a forth. If I could give this place zero starts I would."}
{"text":"Sometimes a review might be low because of poor service or the place was a bit dirty or boring with how they decorate - but the worst review is always when the food is horrible. Though this place has mixed reviews - let me assure you it most likely is not because of the food. My crab - bucket after bucket (I was doing a deep and thorough job and taste testing) was excellent. There were three of us who ordered the all you can eat crab and no one was disappointment in the crab. Another had the all you can eat shrimp and wasn't disappointed - the other had something else I cannot even remember, but he said it was great!  The place has a lot to look at too - fun - interactive stuff for sure and the place - for the type of restaurant this is was as clean as it could be. The price for what we all ordered was within our company policy, which means there wasn't anything that was higher priced than it should be. There is also plenty of parking - just open your eyes!  Finally the service - I have found that if you start off the night with YOU being nice - things go extremely well. However, you start off by being a dickweed - then it will most likely be not so good - only the very best of servers will put up with someone condescending attitude - my advice - think of that server as your mom or dad, brother or sister and things just might turn out better.  I will happily go back to this place - and I travel a lot - so I'm not anyone that has anything to gain or loose by my review!"}
{"text":"A 2 lb. lobster for my birthday dinner makes me a happy girl! .. it was perfectly cooked & came cracked & ready to devour to my table .. free champagne & little cake for those celebrating a birthday or anniversary .. service was excellent .. a bit bothered by the nude painted pictures of children in the ladies room . true their decor is eclectic but I thought that was just distasteful .. that kept them from getting that 5th start .. those paintings need to be taken down .. they are not tacky .. they are offensive"}
{"text":"Went last night for my wife's birthday,  ABSOLUTELY  delicious.  Attentive staff and a overall nice experience.  Had all YCE crab legs. Kept em coming. If. This place wasn't an hour drive from my house I would visit often."}
{"text":"This place seems like it's out in the middle of nowhere, but has pretty tasty seafood.  The snow crab is quite good- the legs are big and the broth they are cooked in is not too salty.  I had the broiled seafood platter, which came with a great variety- scallops, haddock, baby lobster tail, shrimp, mussels.  They have various all you can eat seafood specials, and currently they have a discounted all you can eat crab special for $26 on Tues, Wed, and Thurs."}
{"text":"Funky & fun décor.  Waitress Diedre was great.  We both had lobster bisque which was passable.  Cinnamon bread with apple butter was great.  Crabcakes very dry without much flavor.  Stuffed lobster portabello mushroom was passable.  Food pretty much sucked other than the free bread.  Go for the atmosphere, but just drink and get the free bread."}
{"text":"The is a great place for a beautiful day to enjoy food on the water and relax with good food and good drinks unique and fun decor great service good shrimp and crab legs for the area!"}
{"text":"Pickle Bill's has really gone down hill over the last few years. The menu by far is over priced! Very expensive Coconut Shrimp dinner in which several of the shrimp were soggy and gross on the inside. Ordered the vegetables which were so far from fresh that Gordon Ramsey would throw a fit! Veggies were mushy and who knows how old they were.  And don't even think about paying with a Visa gift card because they won't accept it (Where was that posted?) No big deal but just a heads up. I see no reason to visit Pickle Bills again. I have had more affordable and better quality crab legs and seafood dinners at a local bar in Willoughby."}
{"text":"While the whole restaurant was uniquely decorated and mesmerizing, the food and service is a let down compared to how much people hype it up to be. I wouldn't eat there for a quality meal... unless you're into paying lots of cash for endless crab legs.... that are still not the best."}
{"text":"(*not E.L.)I am a native of Cleveland, but live in Las Vegas now.  I make Pickle Bills a must each time I am home.  We go each August to celebrate my niece's and dad's birthdays.  There are usually about 15 of us and EVERYONE gets the all-you-can-eat crab legs.  While you are spending about $30 + for your dinner, it is totally worth it.  With AYCE you don't have to waste time digging out every last bit of crab; you can just ask for another bucket.  The service is always great.  We let them know ahead of time to just keep the crab, butter, and lemon coming and they do.  We never have to wait to find our server.   The decor is unlike any I have ever seen and it makes for a very enjoyable experience.  The drinks are good and the clam chowder is great too.  The bread and cinnamon butter is incredible, just watch out if you are getting the AYCE anything because it is very tempting to fill up on the free bread. In addition to crab legs they also have add-ons for only $2 and these used to be $5 so they are recession conscious.  It is my recommendation that all seafood lovers in Cleveland make this your destination."}
{"text":"If you want a relaxing waterfront view, this is a great place to have that experience. I ordered the Walleye dinner. The best part of the meal is the lime butter served with the fis,. I ordered the fries for my side. Flacid and slightly underdone. I like mine crispy, didn't happen. But I really want to warn you about the Walleye...every bite has several fish bones in it.Beware!"}
{"text":"The day before my visit here, my buddies and I talked about how we missed out favorite all you can eat prime rib. As that conversation carried on, I pulled up Google on my phone and Google AYCE prime rib and Pickle Bill's was the first to pop up from a list of AYCE spots in Cleveland. I brought it up and it was tossed in the air as place to visit the next day even though we were already having prime rib that night.  Fast forward to today, I yelped the place and it had a lot of mixed reviews. Even with all that, I knew I had to make a visit to give my own review. We made reservations for 11 and made the hour drive to try it out.  8 out of the 11 in our party orders the AYCE prime rib and/or crab legs. Service started off rather slow because our server got swamp, but after all out orders went in, I noticed we had extra help and it was pointed out that it was the owner's wife helping serve us. My guess is that since we were dropping some cash, it was priority to take care of us. I mean she was at our table making sure we got what we needed and got it in a timely fashion. Kudos to that as I've never had that happen before. The restaurant was pretty busy too as most people were waiting for an hour from what I heard as I walked to the men's room.  On to the food. The prime rib was mediocre and the crab legs to start off were not great. There were major inconsistencies in the prime rib cuts and the crab legs were served cold. The crab legs seemed as if they were made the night before and then refrigerated to be served as back up since they through so much. We went two rounds with these crab legs and then the third round came with freshly cooked legs. How can I tell? Well, they were warm and the meat wasn't shriveled and dried up. A refrigerator sucks water out things when you don't cover it. My guess, as stated, is that they make a batch ahead of time or refrigerate what isn't sold from the night before to be served the next day to not take a loss on cooked legs. The freshly cooked legs had juicer meat, because of being freshly cooked, and were warm as stated. With all that being said, it wasn't horrible as they were edible but don't expect top notch  tasting food. I ate 3 rounds of crab legs and 2 cuts of prime rib. I do like he fact that they don't give you the creamy horseradish. I'm not a fan of the creamy stuff at all. Their bread with cinnamon butter is pretty good and their side dishes are okay. I opted for the coleslaw and redness and with rice. The coleslaw was really bland but the red beans and rice was good.   Overall, it's a decent place. We all had the same thing pretty much so I can't really speak on anything else off their menu. It's going to be hard to convince me to make the hour drive back but I would just to take some family or special guests. We sat out on the patio and it felt like we weren't even in Ohio anymore with the decor and the river right there."}
{"text":"Ew.  Not impressed.  Dirty.  Food was mediocre.   Had to return for a friend's birthday and you know what?  It was closed.  So we went to the place directly across from it- it was SO much better!"}
{"text":"Pickle Bills makes me wish I had a boat or even friends with boats.  The floating bar is great if you can get a dock space and a seat on the bar.  I always thought they should make it bigger and have waitresses serve directly to the boat.  This is assuming that all boats are backed in and the driver of the boat signs a waiver.....lol.  I've eaten there several times and even brought out of town guests in for the early bird specials they have.  Snow crab there is cooked perfectly, not a fishy taste on the ass end of the crab either.  Bravo.  Lobster mash is good as a side and of course everyone, including the hungry geese, ducks, and seagulls, love the bread w/ cinnamon butter.  Other dishes I've had and enjoyed are the mussels, clams, salmon, fried perch, and lobster.  Let me just say to everyone that the food is good but.....  ....the ambiance is better.  I kind of feel like a kid on the lower level and a college kid upstairs.  I really like the swing seats except that getting on/off them can be a struggle when you're a little tipsy.  Hey, where else would have all this and even a picture opportunity with your head inside the cut out wooden thingy on your way out?  Forewarning though, it gets busy during dinner hours.  Go early if you can to save some cash and to get in / get out before the regulars start showing up.  I would have given 5 stars but I have had better food and the place does look a little unsafe / run down.  Given its surroundings though, this may help with the dining atmosphere I come to expect from Pickle Bills."}
{"text":"Wow what a waste of a nice evening. He and I had been there years ago individually but never together so we thought we would give it a round 2. Bad idea! We were prompted greeted and had a seat at the bar while waiting for a table to be ready, things started off to be a nice evening. Once seated we ordered, surf and turf for him and walleye for me. The fried dough with cinnamon butter was pretty good but seemed a bit odd as a starter. After those little balls of goodness were gone, things went down hill quick. The good took forever and went it finally came, his steak was way overcooked as was his potato. When a baked potato has char on it, it is the fault of the the trusty heating lamps. We sent the steak back and he wanted to enjoy his snow crab legs but no plate or crackers were given. After ample time, he decided to get cracking and used an appetizer saucer to eat off of. Finally the steak comes and we are both done eating. After speaking to the manager she said that she had heard of a steak getting lost that evening. But did nothing? Not a managerial style if you ask me. We were offered gift cards but declined, vowing to never step foot again inside. $50 lesson learned, and that was after the steak was taken off the bill!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I would give 5 stars for the amazing meal we had last night if we were basing this review on food alone. The crab was as good as ever and the prime rib was better than I've had at steakhouses. That being said, get ready to laugh as I tell you about the worst service I have EVER had in a restaurant.   Some of our party ordered AYCE crab legs, I ordered prime rib and 1/2 lb of snow crab (which is WAY too much food...don't do what I do). The food arrives, my awesome looking med rare prime rib doesn't have a steak knife. I ask two people (one being our server) for a steak knife. 15 minutes later she comes back and now my steak is ice cold. Her hilarious reaction is as follows after I tell her my steak is cold now: Server: \"want me to zap it in the microwave for you?\" Absolutely not.... Kinda of defeating the purpose of a medium rare steak. She then goes to the kitchen to \"see what she can do\" but doesn't take my prime rib. She returns and says \"the kitchen can give you a new 1/2 pound but not the 1lb you ordered\" okay weird... I politely ask to see the manager. She returns 5 minutes later, \"I'll just bring you the 1lb!\" She was so terrified of getting her manager that she came back wit another awesome piece of prime rib. I was fine with that and after that weird mishap I thought she still had time to redeem herself.   Which is exactly what did NOT happen. Over the course of our meal after that fiasco she only filled water glasses once after being asked 3 times. We had to flag her down to get more crab because she never checked on us. We asked for more drawn butter when the other two ordered more crab and she came out with 3 bowls of hard butter while we were waiting for our food. All we could do was laugh! What were we going to do with all this readable butter and no food on the table?  Amazing food but the service was THE WORST I have ever had at a restaurant and will turn me off from returning."}
{"text":"There is no better place for crab legs in Northeast Ohio especially since Chef Bob Bundy is back in the kitchen. The food is delicious from the fried dough with honey cinnamon butter to the salads with homemade croutons and the amazing seafood. I love Pickle Bills especially in the summer. I take all of my best customers here for lunch because it always makes an impact. I can't say enough about this place. Try the king or snow crab, the prime rib or the lobster tails. Also the blackened salmon caesar salad is to die for!"}
{"text":"It was a $180 night but we ate a lot of crab legs. Great service."}
{"text":"If you don't really care about freshness or great flavor and just like to eat food and pay too much, then Pickle Bills is for you.  Three of us visited last weekend and we were all disappointed.  The positives....the place has a cool atmosphere and our waitress, Christine was OUTSTANDING!   She might be the best waitress I have ever had. I ordered the Fisherman's platter because I was in the mood for fried food and lots of tartar sauce.  The shrimp and fish had a heavy coating of panko breading and appeared as if it was mass produced instead of being made fresh.  It was just average.  Mom had the broiled platter and she was not impressed either.  REALLY rubbery clams and a piece of fish at the bottom of the plate that was waterlogged by time she got to it.  The cole slaw that came with it was horrendous. Dry, no flavor, some of the worst I have ever tasted.  My brother had some stuffed shrimp and still nobody at our table was at all impressed by the preparation or flavor. Once again, below par and way too expensive.  Guess what?  Not going back."}
{"text":"Pickle Bill's had always been my favorite go-to for lobster, but no more. We went there this past Friday to celebrate my fiancé's BIG promotion. Boy were we disappointed!  The prices continue to increase but the menu never changes. We ordered a twin lobster tail dinner & a prime rib & shrimp skewer. Everything was served over cooked, including the lobster. I complained & received more over cooked lobster. I felt so bad for our server who was really great. I finally got up without letting my fiancé know what I was doing & found the manager for myself as no one was willing to assist me. She followed me back to my table to make certain she knew which table we were at but never came over to apologize. She comped the meal but an apology should have been included. We tipped our server very generously and paid for our drinks but left with a really bad taste in our mouths. It's such a shame but we will not be back for dinner..."}
{"text":"Incredibly kitschy... like, an overwhelming amount of silly decoration.  But, non-chain restaurants are few in this area, and the food here is quite decent.  The portions are large, the prices aren't bad.  (The All You Can Eat prices are high... but I can't eat that much :)   ).   They do a great job of accommodating large groups/parties.  I'd heard the service is poor; I thought it was reasonable but I don't really like to have a waiter hovering by my table through the whole meal, so perhaps my expectations are different.    I haven't been here in the summer, so I'm looking forward to coming back in good weather to try the patio seating."}
{"text":"So I should start this out with saying we had a group of 15. We were celebrating my littlest sister's first communion. I loved our server, I think her name was Breanna (some spelling of that name) and she was so welcoming and pleasant. Our first disappointment was that we could not all sit at the same table. One table was behind us. We cancelled our reservation at our family's favorite place because they said we couldn't all sit together, Pickle Bills never warned us this would be an issue or we probably wouldn't have dined here. It was just a shock and we were very unhappy, as well the family that got stuck at the additional table and couldn't converse with all of us easily. So if you have a big party I suggest requesting a table together, unless you enjoy alienating half your family.  But the food was good. I ordered the 1lb of crab, which to me was reasonably priced and very yummy. I love the my giant side salad! I wish they had more/better side options. The red skin potatoes were bland, my boyfriend corn on the cob was bland, my mom's green beans were average. Just nothing amazing or flavorful, but our main courses were all good. My sister in law loved the smothered chicken, my mom liked the stuffed shrimp, my dad devoured all you can eat prime rib, my boyfriend good the seafood sensations with no complaints (other than his full lobster was looking at him and he had never had to open one before and we had to teach him how), my brother wasn't into his lobster mac but he wouldn't tell us why, he just didn't eat more than 2 bites.  The kids were ecstatic with their food, they really loved that they could trade coins for popsicles at the end!!  So an overall review, service was great, most of the food was great! I do wish they would elevate their sides, especially since they have nice and higher priced entrees. And I wish they would have told us we wouldn't sit together when they made the reservation.  I guess the highlight of them not telling us is we got to check this place out, but my mom was super upset."}
{"text":"Mildly disappointing. Strange experience with timing all around. We came on a thursday night so it was not very busy. I will say the food was ok and the people working were pleasant enough. They need a little help with the timing of the dishes. I ordered a dinner salad with shrimp and they brought me a side salad, no shrimp and not fresh tomatoes.  I assumed they made a mistake so I ate all of my App (which was pretty good) and all my salad. My daughter had nothing to eat while we sat there with our salads-which I think is odd- Then our entrees come out and there is my dinner salad with shrimp.  There is currently a Romain lettuce scare and that was predominantly my dinner salad. I asked for a box and took home the shrimp and a few lettuce leafs.  Everyone elses order came out ok except my husband ordered a beer that he had to remind our server of.(which was delivered in a can...which is totally fine but easily cldve been brought earlier) The meal took a very long time to come to our table. If you arent with a child, and dont mind waiting and reminding your servers of your orders, this place could be a fun experience on the river. We didnt really enjoy our time with our 6 year old tbh.  Paying for the meal took like 20 minutes alone. If you go here, remember to allow yourself the time.  Over a hundred dollar ticket included a childs cheeseburger, a salad, a beer,  fish and chips, chicken, fried pickles and a mushroom appetizer."}
{"text":"Had another great meal at Pickle Bills! We ate here tonight for my daughter's birthday. We started with the fried pickles and clams and mussels, both delicious. I had the prime rib, my husband got the seafood sampler, which was plenty of food for us and to share with our daughter. The atmosphere is fun. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Came here for the all-you-can-eat prime rib and crab legs, and I don't really see the need to come back here for a while.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good and I was definitely satisfied.  The prime rib was overcooked when we ordered it medium rare, but on the next round we ordered it rare and it came out medium rare, which was perfect (if that makes sense).  The crab legs were good and plentiful, fairly easy to crack, and most of the time yielding large quantities of delicious meat.  Service was only OK and, as we were about to leave, a huge party of 17 of the trashiest people you've ever seen showed up and sat right by us.  They didn't even make a reservation, they just kind of showed up.  How dumb do you have to be to not make a reservation for 17 people?  The coup de grace of trashiness occurred when one of the diners asked, \"what's lobster bisque, is that a meal or something?\"  Oh man...  Pickle Bill's is worth coming to every year or so.  I'll be back next Summer for a clambake or something.  Hold the trashy mega-groups, please."}
{"text":"Overpriced and the food is not that good anymore!  When we visited not too long for AYCE crab legs they were market priced, which were $60+!!!  Come on now, that is ridiculous.  Who eats that much on average or even make it worthwhile?!  They should just close this place own - go to red lobster if u really need seafood in lake county..."}
{"text":"So where do I begin? I decided to try out this place after spending a Sunday morning at Headlands Beach. Thankfully, there was no wait to be seated as the restaurant was rather dead.  Pickle Bill's reminds me of a garage sale in Daytona Beach. I know...you're probably wondering where that came from. The restaurant is dated in very tacky oceanic decor reminiscent of the 80s along with a taxidermy alligator if I recall correctly. The servers are dressed in button up Hawaiian shirts of a painfully pastel color palette. The restaurant is huge, but slightly lacking in cleanliness on my particular visit. I understand that the location right on the lake exposes the restaurant to the elements, but the windows seemed very dirty and the tables were rather sticky.  However, I can say that the food is fantastic! Although slightly pricey (which I expect at a restaurant that specializes in seafood), the portions are huge! My boyfriend and I got the fried cod and chips [fries] and the portion was huge, we each brought half home for later.   So the cons are the cleanliness and the outdated decor...but to be honest, I still enjoyed this place. It's not romantic, but it's fun. I probably won't go back, as I prefer more intimate settings that are primarily full of adults, but I recommend anyone to give it a try for themselves."}
{"text":"Pickle Bills has been around for over 40 years at this point, so I'm a little surprised that there aren't any reviews.  I'll begin by stating simply that I liked the place.  I would go back, probably not often, but from time to time it would be a welcome change.   PB's is basically a gigantic, waterfront, family seafood restaurant in the far eastern suburbs of Cleveland. It's one of the few non-chain places out that way, and it has a charm all it's own. Sure I've been to places with Krazy Krap all over the walls, and generally I find it sort of obnoxious.  PB's, however, takes this concept so far out over the edge, you really can't help but appreciate it.  It's really something else. It's like a cargo ship full of vintage knick-knacks ran aground, flipped over, and exploded.  It makes your run of the mill chain place look like amateur hour (which they kind of are, right?).    Anyway, the food leans heavily toward seafood, though there are other selections, and everyone at our table seemed to be pretty pleased with their selections.  Highlights were the lobster bisque (which had a surprising and welcome kick to it), their \"famous\" fried pickles (also surprisingly spicy), and the Whiskey River Chicken entree.  No one in our group was too keen on the coleslaw, which had an unexpected nutty flavor.  Tables are also served complimentary fried dough with cinnamon butter.  Similar to munchkin doughnuts, but firmer and heavier in consistency, they were delicious.  I couldn't stop eating them.  Prices at PB's are a little higher than your typical family joint, so it's not a great stop if you're not feeling spendy.    As an added bonus, our very attentive and friendly waiter was a dead ringer for John Waters, good times!"}
{"text":"Love the food ! Atmosphere is really pretty special and wait staff fantastic !"}
{"text":"There are more weird statues in here than in Norton Furniture. You must let your eyes adjust if coming in from the sun because you just may think that some of the figures are real. The food was pretty good. I really enjoyed the atmosphere. If you ever decide to drive out to the Headlands beach, you may as well stop here, eat some food and drink a beer in a very unique environment."}
{"text":"Pretty bad.  Had been here a few years back, wow did this go downhill.  Service was horrifically slow - didn't help that she had way too many tables.  Food - bad, just plain bad.  Had some fried shrimp - how hard is that?  Over-cooked blobs of mess.  Don't waste you're time.  Go across the street to Brennan's."}
{"text":"I'm trying to save you.  Had lunch at PBs on Friday, 8/25. As a kid I grew up on the lake on the NE side, so this place is an institution that is always a trip home of sorts. Loved it.  I wouldn't go back if I saw Robert Irvine exiting flanked by Mother Mary, Ezekiel and George Tekai. I've spent most of the last 3 days with my hamhocks gorilla glued to the toilet seat punctuated by doubling over in pain.  Started with their much loved fried dough bread & brown sugar butter. Those babies were like the Lake Erie shore stones, certainly left over unwrapped from the day before. And they were soooooo good in years' past. It gets worse. Their chowder I'd been in love with for years arrived the temperature of tap water. The lukewarm soup was again obviously a day old reheat. I choked it down anyway in dismay, and one of my best memories was fading to black. Then the dagger: peel and puke shrimp. It arrives at the same tepid temp as the soup; neither cold as cocktail style nor hot off the boil in old bay seasoning. It was rubbery and straight up had the funk. It had to be days old. Like a dyngus I ate it anyway.  Now Im not ACCUSING PB of giving me food poisoning. That could be considered libel. And I don't want none a that. Let's just say it was coincidental that this was the last dining experience I had before my colon became an inverted oil derrick for 36 hours.  Server was Adam. Nice guy, semi-anticipatory. And there were swarms of bees they couldn't care less about exterminating. If the server were Anna Kendrick she couldn't have saved that Ishtar of a lunch.  Go to Brennan's if you want anything other than bottled beer and liquor. Treat it like TJ.  Thomas Wolf was dead on."}
{"text":"LOVED LOVED LOVED!! Decor was fun and beautiful, service was fantastic, food was all around yum!  You could really tell the put effort in everything they served!  A bit pricey but thats expected.  Wish we cohld go back now!  Thanks"}
{"text":"Two words - sensory overload.  And that's just the kitschy decor. Wish my tastebuds would have had the same experience. Worth it just for the experience though."}
{"text":"Did not enjoy the food. My fish was way over cooked to the point of being dry and tuff, the shrimp was as well. The only thing the made the evening good was the company I was with. I am a non smoker and though we sat outside I did not expect the table next to us to be given an ashtray so they could smoke, I would have like there to be a non smoking section on the patio. I am very disappointed in the food and atmosphere. I will not eat there again. Not worth the money:-("}
{"text":"AWESOME FOOD, The seafood is amazing, so is the prime rib. Has a waterfront bar that you can dock your boat at, and some cool decorations and photo opts inside the restraunt. A bit pricey, but definitly a favorite place of mine."}
{"text":"Ridiculously kitschy and fun! Took my dad here for fathers day, Shocker he didn't complain, he complains about everything, reasonable prices for seafood, love the all you can eat crab legs, and service was good!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant... Key word \"was\". Myself and a party of 6 were out last night (Saturday) for AYCE crab legs. Most of the food was great... Aside from the whole redskin potatoes that are the size of apples un cut and un seasoned thrown onto a plate that were served as a side with my prime rib.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive no complaints in that dept. All seven of us ordered separate entree sized (and priced which btw has almost doubled as of recently) meals but we're then told we couldn't pay full price for another AYCE crab leg dinner for the center of the table. I understand where this wouldn't be alright if only one dinner was ordered and then everyone wanted to share crab legs but every head at the table was already spending $25+ at least (including two AYCE crab dinners). We get our food and everything was pretty good until our waitress comes over to tell us that she \"got in trouble bc her manager was watching us share crab legs\" we then asked for the creeper to come over to our table who had apparently been watching us . The \"manager\" was rude as hell and kept talking over everyone like she knew everything... the dumb bitch didn't even know how long the restaurant had been open and clearly doesn't know how to handle situations in which customers are un happy. The fact that it was 8 p.m on a Saturday and we were the only people in a section with about 25 tables as well as surrounded by multiple empty sections throughout the place gives you a good idea of the business they do.  We definitely won't be back any time soon... If ever. So disappointing I had been looking forward to dinner there all week.   P.s. Gas blower style heating is for garages and barns NOT restaurants. No one wants to feel hot air being blown in their face or on the backs of their necks while eating. If a door to the outside has to be propped open with a chair to be able to breath you may want to invest in a better heating system. What a joke... Stay clear of the lower seating section with the plastic windows!"}
{"text":"Pickle Bill's I've been to a few times, a few with the family and a few others for a double-date when I'm in the area visiting my sister, and every time it's been great. Fish is always cooked to order and the atmosphere outside on the dock patio is so much fun and a great way to unwind with friends. Definitely recommended and I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Would love to give this restaurant more stars because of the AYCE crab legs which is the main reason that I visit. But after my visit last night for my dads birthday, I don't think I will be returning. The service was nothing more than terrible last night. Considering that we had a large party of about 16 people, complaints are going to happen...and how those complaints are handled by staff says a lot about the establishment. For starters we had to use a total of 2 tables for our party. At first notice the waitress seemed flustered like she wasn't expecting to be serving 2 tables or had no experience with doing it. Everything was fine in the beginning and everyone was enjoying their meals. One member of our party ordered mushrooms which she felt were burnt and sent them back. The waitresses response was \"those aren't burnt\"...not very customer service like. At one table alone we had 4 out of 8 people order the AYCE crab legs. The other table had also ordered about 2 AYCE orders. Our waitress (Deidra) kept the crab legs coming at a pretty steady pace. About 10-15 buckets of crab legs later, my dad (whose birthday it was btw) asked for another order of crab legs. The waitress then said she couldn't serve him anymore because she would lose her job because he was sharing them...huhhhh??? She also proceeded to tell another person in our party the same thing. Considering that EVERY ONE in our party ordered a full meal ($25+) including some AYCE shrimp meals etc, we had no idea that sharing would be such a big deal (The bottom of the menu clearly states that plate sharing is an extra $7. Just add on the damn money instead of denying us our orders). To downright refuse us meals that we already paid for just didn't seem right at all! WE WANT AYCE! Lol. So my dad was clearly taken aback and asked for management. EPIC FAIL. The high & mighty manager pounced over like the donkey that she is, and when trying to explain to her that my dad only shared crab legs with my step mother who couldn't eat a lot because of gastric by-pass surgery the manager says \"well that has nothing to do with it, we don't allow sharing\", everything we said she had an argumentative come-back for. No sense of customer service & problem solving skills at ALL! My step mother then made note to the manager that they were very argumentative and brought up the mushroom incident. The manager says \"well those mushrooms weren't burnt, I saw them\". The whole time she was just being an argumentative asshole so we informed that we would be contacting upper management.  After the whole AYCE incident our party pretty much brought up more incidents. Like the fact that one person in our party ordered AYCE perch but wanted a seasoned fish to taste. He liked it and requested more. More was never brought out for him although the waitress insisted that it was (she even said she sent it out with another waiter so it wasn't her fault). Yeah ok. Lots of commotion was happening from the catastrophe that was the bad service & when overhearing a member of our party say that she wasn't going to ask for the manager again because she would end up cussing her out, the waitress threatens us and says \"well if it's a problem the police are outside\". Police? Seriously? The waitress actually called the police on us because she said she felt \"threatened\"...talk about poor service! While passing out receipts she had to redo the receipts upwards of 3x because she couldn't even get that right! The waitress then overhears my stepmother complaining about the overall staff experience and the waitress says \"well maybe it wouldn't happen if you were a better customer\". I couldn't believe my ears!!! And to top it all off, before leaving I tried to finish my salad and guess what I found? A LONG BLONDE HAIR smh. We will not be returning at all!"}
{"text":"Food awful. Two cheeseburgers one fish sandwich and 1 perch dinner took over 30 minutes to get and then it was cold. Cheeseburgers said under the heat lamp until the cheese didn't resemble cheese. Never going back. Waitress was bad. Brought out coffee no cream and then when she finally brought cream the coffee was cold. Don't eat here ever."}
{"text":"The clam bake is a fun experience.  Lots of tasty food.  They were bust and tried to take care of everyone.  It was a beautiful Sunday."}
{"text":"Went here last night and the food is still top notch. Unfourtunaly it was extreamly busy and there were alot of service issues. Took 30min for a bar seat to open and even longer for restraunt seating. Ordered a drink took the server another 20 min to bring it to me.   I was seated on bar table until a bar seat opened up I orderd the ayce shrimp and lobster bisq. The shrimp came with 2 dinner items I got corn and salad. The shrimp arrived before anything else I asked about the salad and she said she almost forgot and I told her just to pack it to go. The lobster bisq arrived after I was done with my meal and it was subpar I was way to thick to me. I asked for a bowl and only got a cup. The shrimp where excellent crunchy and good the peel and eat where also good. Overall it was a good experience I'm understanding in knowing things happan during a very busy time I was checked on often and the bartender took off the soup and only charged me one of my 2 drinks so I left a decent tip."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat crabs legs for your dollar hands down. Crab legs come out immediately. One after another without hesitation. Staff is very friendly and the environment is great. A little pricey but well worth the extra cash if you're looking for a great food and service. I would gladly pay more money for better food and service than get a smaller bill with lower quality crab legs and service... Anyone who believes that bumpers in willoughby can hold a candle to pickle Bulls in the crab leg department is delusional."}
{"text":"A glimpse of summer!  So, it was 80+ degrees yesterday, and my fiance pleasantly surprised me with the \"I am treating you to Pickle Bills tonight\"!!  AWESOME!!  It was the release of cabin fever at its finest!  Shorts, sandals, T-shirt, windows rolled down, sitting outside on the deck watching the sunset!  It was a beautiful evening, with great food and atmosphere.  Unfortunately, they were out of the Fish Specials for the day, so I opted for the Swordfish, blackened, with corn on the cob and a salad.  All was cooked perfect.  I really liked how they did not drown the corn with butter, but rather put it in a side cup and let you determine how much you wanted to put on, same with salad dressing for the salad.  Of course we had their delicious fried dough with cinnamon butter!!  The wildlife was out, and the ducks/geese were swimming all around!  OH YEAH!!! Did I mention, it was great to sit down and have a cigarette while dining, since we were outside on the deck.  All in all, it was as usual a great dinner, best place to go for seafood in Lake County!!  I followed it up with their homemade Key Lime Pie, which was great.  The service was prompt, friendly, and on the ball!  Great Night!"}
