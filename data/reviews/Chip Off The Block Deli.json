{"text":"Happy to finally have a great sandwich spot close to home. The brisket and French dip sandwiches are amazing and will have you going back again and again."}
{"text":"I had been looking for a good Reuben on this side of town to no avail. Then I went to Chip Off The Block and finally found it! I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Finally a nice sandwich shop close to home. The location was clean. The staff was friendly. The menu selection will have us coming back again to try more items. I had the french dip and it melted in your mouth with plenty of flavor. My wife had a hot pastrami that I thought was great, she thought was a little salty but not bad. Plus, the sidewinder fries dipped in beer batter are worth coming back for all by themselves."}
{"text":"Staff was pleasant, we told them it was our first time, while stating this I was eyeing their salads and slaw. The girl behind the counter asked if there's  anything I want to try, she'll  let me have a taste. I should've  taken her up on it cuz the pineapple/coconut slaw sounded and looked amazing, same with the chicken salad
I ordered the pastrami sandwich with sidewinder fries which  was so tasty! Plump, crispy fries, sandwich was served on mixed rye bread with coleslaw in the sandwich. That trio gave the sandwich an amazing dimension of flavor!
My son had the 3 cheese grilled cheese sandwich  on Texas  toast, which was good.
My husband had the baby back ribs with Mac n cheese. He ordered sauce on the side but it still came on top and the ribs tasted old, meat pulled away from the bone and the bone was dried out. We lived in TX for 14 years and bbq is one of our faves, so we know when some things up. 
PLUS it took 20 minutes for our food to come out, not sure why but it did.
There are still a few  sandwiches we would like to try, so yeah we'll  be back"}
{"text":"Ordered French Dip. Very good. Pretty large portions, was able to save some for dinner. Girl at the counter was very sweet. Will come back cause there are so many options to choose from... I wanted to eat everything!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome....Very nice staff and not over priced. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and beer battered fries and baked beans, my husband and son ordered The Wagyu and beer battered fries. The by Her was very juicy and so yummy.The pulled pork is so tasty as well cooked just right and not over sauced. I will be going back that's for sure. Job well done guys"}
{"text":"I ordered a reuben and realized when I got home that I had received a pastrami (not corned beef as it should have been) and swiss sandwich with sourkraut and NO dressing.  I had to whip up a batch of dressing while my food sat on the table getting cold in order to make it edible.  The bread was also drenched in butter for whatever reason...gross!  Probably the worst reuben I have ever had.  The fries were good at least, but that's not what I paid $11 for.  First and last visit."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and pulled pork!!!!! So worth it! I love the restaurant on one side and the fresh meat selection on the other side. Killer fries!"}
{"text":"Marcella in the front is mean I obviously bothered her as she told me to hold on rudely just wanted a sandwich won't be back"}
{"text":"Had the brisket sandwich and the bbq egg rolls. Both were delicious, but my wife especially enjoyed the egg rolls. Also, the attached butcher shop (or is the deli attached?) was neat and had some cuts I don't normally see at Smith's."}
{"text":"We often visit their Durango location and decided to give their second location a try. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with fries a loaded skins. They DID NOT disappoint!!!! The brisket on the skins melted in my mouth and had so much flavor! The restaurant was clean and the employees were super nice. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Finally went in and was EXTREMELY satisfied. Service was quick and food came out fast........ and was fantastic. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"The restaurant portion is so disappointing. I ordered a pulled chicken sandwich w/ fries and a brisket sandwich w/ sweet potato tots for my boyfriend. The woman behind the desk didn't know how to delete an error we made in our order so she asked the manager for help. The manager was SO rude to both her employee and us!  She huffed and puffed about having to help, shaking her head at all of us and rolling her eyes. 
Once we got home to eat, the sweet potato tots were replaced with fries (against our request).  And my sandwich was missing coleslaw which was supposed to come with it!
I'd give this place one star but I appreciated how nice the woman behind the counter was to us despite her b**** of a manager."}
{"text":"Wow! My pulled pork sandwich was not only huge but it tasted so good. The perfect combination of sweet and savory. Topped with coleslaw! The mac and cheese was nothing to brag about but the sandwich was so delicious that my boyfriend actually ended up eating more than half of mine. Will definitely be coming back, especially because we live so close."}
{"text":"Meh, sandwiches were decent. We both ordered the mac and cheese as sides and there was literally 3 bites in the each tiny cup. Why even bother making that a side option if you're going to be so stingy?! That just upsets customers seeing that's what they paid for (I've read a few other reviews stating the same thing.)"}
{"text":"I ordered full rack of baby back ribs, flavor was good but the meat was tough like a jerky.  The beef brisket was not bad. The fries and sweet potatoes tots were delicious. I don't recommend getting the Mac salad to go, stuff with mayo spoils quickly."}
{"text":"Sorry, but just had my last trip to this place. The sandwiches are quite good and their fries are great. Customer service is the worst. Who wants to be greeted with a sneer and scowl? It's pretty clear that the deli employee hates her job or has other uncontrollable issues. This makes the whole experience a total downer.

Pass."}
{"text":"Really great food, great flavor! The kids enjoyed it too. 
I'm looking forward to trying many other items on the menu. The meat was really tender! 
I only wish the French dip came on a hoagie to actually dip it in the auju cup, like the posted picture shows it does. Mine came on an onion bun so I had to cut it in quarters to make it fit into the cup size they give you. 
The macaroni and cheese had great flavor, the kids were confused because it was white cheese then they tasted it and thought it was very good. 
Their fries are so delicious they are a must try with whatever you order. 
I do recommend you give them a try, they deserve a five star their food was so good, and service was great."}
{"text":"We ordered  the fiery bird and the bbq pulled pork they were amazing and the staff was very helpful and friendly! Definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches shops in town!! Huge portion size excellent quality meats, cheese, produce and breads. Highly recommended for hot or cold hoagies and more!!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in town! Thinly sliced meat, cheese and veggies. Large portions and the butcher shop has just about every meat."}
{"text":"BEST deli sandwiches in this area of town, arguably one of the best in the city!!  Top quality meats smoked in house and prepared the way you want. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the fact that I love the butcher side of this store, but the deli side is a f*c king disaster. I waited in line for 20 minutes for them to get the customer in front of me a rack of ribs and half a pound of pulled pork. I would advise that people avoid the deli side. That is until they get there act together."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to update my review a year later - they previously earned a 5-Star review from me for their Turkey Burger & their Service...but now a year later I'd give them a 3 (so they Average a 4 from me)
They've since removed the Turkey Burger from their menu (arguably their Best item) and they now close earlier & trying to get them on the Phone to place an Order is like getting ahold of the IRS on 4-15. Also, their food & service all depends on Who is working on a particular day, as some are not as pleasant as those who initially started here when the New Rainbow location opened"}
{"text":"How I wish I could give this place a higher rating. How I wish! Only because that would mean I found a Vegas deli that I could find a great Rueben, if only!

Maybe my standards of a Rueben or a sandwich with salty meat like corned beef or pastrami is a bit high but a girl has to have her standards! The sandwich itself was aesthetically pleasing but once I took that first bite it was like myself and my sandwich went to hell in a handbasket. I don't think I am exaggerating because my dreams of a ligit deli style sandwich just disappeared like my dreams of being a Prima Ballerina. 

The only way I can describe my Rueben was it was off, just off. Everything in it was a Rueben but it had to boil down to the corned beef. It was not as tender as I was hoping and was a bit dry in some spots. Maybe I am a bit spoiled with delis in New York, where competition of having great corned beef is crucial. Maybe in Vegas we do not have that same competition. Who knows. I only know that I am still on the look out for my Rueben."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with some friends on Friday. Friend called to see what time they were open till and it was within like 5 minutes from a friends house. 

I've been meaning to take a visit to this place and their \"The Butcher Block\" store for ages so took this opportunity to visit both sides. The butcher shop moved down Rainbow to a new complex just before Windmill. Lots of stuff to offer. I figured, if they own a butcher place, their meats must be better quality in their deli/restaurant side XD But more on that side in their own review

Their on screen menu is not as extensive as their menu printed in front of the cashier. Their menu consists of small plates, smokehouse sandwiches & ribs, subs, hot sandwiches, and burgers

Deli meats/cheeses, they use Boars Head, as with a lot of italian places or deli's nowadays. There's a decent selection of salads and stuff you can get as well displayed similar to other deli restaurants or in a supermarket. 

-----------------------

Myself and another decided to get \"The Butcher Block\" which is their original Italian Sub consisting of black forest ham, salami, hot cappy, pepperoni, with provolone and pepperoncini. 

2 others got \"The Butcher Block Gourmet Steak Burger\" which consists of fresh ground steak from their butcher shop (angus choice and prime beef) with white & yellow American Cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, and pepperhouse gourmaise served on a brioche bun and a side of their thick spiral cut fries

1 got \"The Shroom Burger\" which consists of fresh ground from their butcher shop (Angus choice chuck) with sauteed mushrooms and swiss cheese served on a brioche bun, mayo and a side of their thick spiral cut fries

---------------------

\"The Butcher Block\" sandwich was pretty good. One of the better subs ive had. With a choice of white or wheat roll, their soft hoagie style bread was at a length of maybe give or take maybe 10 inches. Stuffed with multiple layers of very thinly sliced meats topped with provolone, thinly cut tomatoes, finely shredded lettuce and a good amount of either like a oil and vinegar or homemade vinaigrette. Light but flavorful. Simple yet delicious. Devoured my sub pretty quick ! LOL om nom nom 

Apparently only HOT sandwiches come with fries... what why? D: 

\"The Butcher Block Gourmet Steak Burger\" appears to look really good like a traditional burger with all its toppings. With their mix of choice and prime beef, id think the burger patty itself be pretty good, if seasoned and grilled appropriately. Same for the \"Shroom Burger\" as well. 

Though without looking carefully at the menu, i didnt know they used different meats combinations. Either Angus Choice Chuck (half their burgers),   Angus Choice & Prime beef (their gourmet steak burger), or the Grass Fed Chuck. There's also a turkey burger and an american wagyu chuck too. 

Speaking of which, i didnt know you can add Bacon for $1.50, Avocado for $1, Fried Egg for $1, or Foie Gra for $6 on the burgers... Kind of hard to see on their printed menu without knowing. 

I do wish to return to try either the \"Chip off the Block\" gourmet italian sub or \"The Reuben\" or their burgers myself one day. Pretty good so far, though a little out of the way for me unless im in the area."}
{"text":"Food was so delicious! Everything tasted so fresh and homemade and came out in a short time. I had the tri tip with the red potato salad and my husband has the Reuben with their fries. Both we sooo good. The cashier [didn't get her name :( ] was so sweet and helpful with her recommendations. Will definitely be back and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"I had the French dip sandwich and it was good. The mac n cheese has amazing flavor. We ordered to go and they forgot a sandwich and the au jus spilled all over everything. They gladly remade the sandwich since the spilled au jus made it soggy. The fries are also good and cut differently (on the thick side). I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Great place to stop in and grab a sandwich or some fresh deli meat for entertaining! Lots of options for each type of meat and flavor, side options are awesome as well. Customer service was great as well!"}
{"text":"Best chicken salad sandwich I have EVER HAD! I'm picky but, there is not one negative thing I could say about the quality of this sandwich. I recommend EVERYONE TO TRY IT. You will be beyond pleasantly surprised.
I can't wait for my next visit...no changing my mind...CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICH is my new favorite sandwich in ALL of Las Vegas!
Thank you for the amazing quality and simple deliciousness this sandwich offers!"}
{"text":"Before leaving a Yelp rating, I emailed the business from the website letting them know 2 salads and au jus were missing from our to-go order. We did not realize their mistake until we had gotten home. Not worth it to drive back, but will not be returning customers as they did nothing to make it right. Footing a bill of almost $40., I gave your business free money for food we never received. Sadly, will not be returning customers."}
{"text":"Chip off the old block! It's a butcher shop and an amazing place to get your protein in after the gym or a long day of work ! 

Environment: Very clean and spacious floor plan. A little too spacious since my little guy was running all over the place lol. It has a mom and pop feel to the place, which gives it a lot of character. 

Food : My family and I ordered the pulled pork egg rolls and the bacon cheddar fries. 

The bacon cheddar fries were mediocre. 
The pulled pork egg rolls, AMAZING! A must try when eating here! It's a pork BBQ heaven rolled in a crispy shell.

The main entree, I ordered the Wagyu beef burger. 8/10 Very tender and flavorful. Mine was a bit overcooked. I would order again! 

My wife ordered, a classic burger. She gives it an 8/10. Succulent and juicy. She would try something else the next time around."}
{"text":"As I entered I was greeted and said hello. I then looked at the menu. When I was ready I walked up to the counter where I was told by the employee to hang on a second - they were sweeping the floor. Sure, no problem. But they just kept going and going. Must have thought I really didn't have anything better to do than watch them clean up. Whatever. When they were finally done I ordered the Chip Off the Block sub to go. Got home and it was drowning in vinaigrette oil. I dabbed it off the bread in hopes that it might help. Was only able to eat half of it. The other half was just too wet and probably would've made me sick. Plus, it wasn't worth it. Tasted terrible with all that oil. For the parts not soaking wet it was an ok sub. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"This deli place is seriously the triple bomb.com!!! Elijah makes the best mac & cheese ever!!!!! Sam is an awesome sandwich maker!! Kiky needs to be manager and Gilbert he's a nice man....and everyone else is simply out of this world! !! Customer service awesome! !!! I will always come back if that's ok??"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in a long time, and friendly staff. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolutely amazing! Melissa was an attentive and personable server.  We told her it was our first visit and she brought out several salads to try. The spicy jalapeno cole slaw was so delicious! After our fabulous meal, we went next door to the Butcher Block for a few steaks to grill tomorrow! They have a great selection including dog bones! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came in today for the first time. Ordered The French Delphia. Basically a philly cheese steak with au jus on the side. It was amazing. My buddy had a pulled pork sandwich that was even better. I'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly but the food is disgusting. I got the cheesy potato fries with bacon and the bbq shredded chicken sandwich. They popped my fries in the microwave so the cheese was really hard and stuck to the paper underneath. The bbq chicken sandwich had a really bad smell to it so I didn't even bother eating that. It really sucks cause I know the owner at the rainbow location and he is such a nice guy. I would still recommend picking up a few things at the butcher shop next door."}
{"text":"BBQ is great, and here at Chip off the block they do a pretty good job at capturing it. So far I've had tri tip and brisket sandwiches, and also baby back ribs, all very good. Not too overpowering with the sauce. Make sure to try their fries too, they are welcome break from the traditional."}
{"text":"Hella bomb ... Tri tip BBQ sandwich was LIT!!
Great portion wonderful tasting try tip with the excellent barbecue sauce on a nice Kaiser roll. I like their fries too they're very different! This is my first time here and there deli looked like they  had wonderful steaks chicken burgers turkey etc."}
{"text":"This place was damn good to me! I like the fact they are combined with a butcher, and I could tell the animal carcass I ate was as fresh as you can get it in stores."}
{"text":"Never thought I would write a \" one star\" review for the Chip Off the Block. Hungry and tired after a four hour drive from California, stopped at the deli for lunch. Order a Chip Off the Block cold sandwich and a Hot Pastrami sandwich, changed it from Rye bread to a roll. When I arrived home that's exactly what I got pastrami on a roll. The description of the sandwich reads; pastrami navel, Swiss cheese, cole slaw and thousand island dressing (sounds yummy, right) My sandwich was not as described, a roll and pastrami, dry and tough, YUCK! Took two bites and threw the sandwich away. I did call them and he did apologize. He stated I GUESS the kitchen thought you wanted a French Dip. Really, I said \"So where is the Au Jus? I didn't order a French Dip.\" Needless to say communication between the person taking the order and kitchen needs an improvement. When in doubt clarify the order, double check the order and ask the customer if it's to their liking. 

Lesson learned, check your order before leaving the \"Chip Off The Block\" deli.

The owner was gracious, offered us to come back and try Pastrami sandwich again on the house. We took him up on his offer and we are so happy we did. Once again we order the Pastrami sandwich as we had before, it was prepared to our liking. My husband said it was even better the next day! I ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich, talk about yummy! The sauces are absolutely delicious, I hoped they will be bottled and sold in the future. Everything about the sandwich was good, Pork was tasty, loved the coleslaw, including the bun. 

Unfortunately, we overheard a phone call from a disgruntled customer. Their order they picked up wasn't cooked to order. One of the worker stated \"well at least he didn't get charge for the Avocado or the egg, he got but didn't want\". Once again whomever is bagging the order or serving it, must check the order to make sure it was cooked to order."}
{"text":"I have a new favorite for the area! We got the tri-tip and the brisket sandwich. Both were on point. The tri-tip was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Very tender. I like that they put bbq sauce but just a little so the flavor of the meat could shine. 

The brisket was awesome. Not overly smoked and got a good portion of the bark which had a really nice flavorful char on it. 

The place was very clean and the employees were very friendly and knowledgable about the meat. 

I can't wait to go back and try more sammiches.

Update. 
On our second visit we got the pulled pork and the beef sandwich with aujus. The porksandwich was killer. Soft flavorful pork with a tangy sauce and coleslaw. Loved it. 
The beef sandwhich ws very good. the beef was tender and had a ton of flavor. The aujus was not really needed but i enjoyed it.
The only thing i did not like on this trip was the potato salad. You would think with sandwhiches this special that the potato salad would be killer but it was pretty bland. 
I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"We've been in here a few times now, and the food is seriously delicious. I recommend the pulled chicken sandwich- so good! The customer service is also top notch. The guy behind the counter even offered us samples of his freshly made tomato soup of the day- which was spectacular. Close to the house and great on a week night."}
{"text":"This rating is high because the food is A+ and 5 star for sure, but my goodness we just wanted our food. It took about 20 minutes for us to get our food, I understand it's not fast food, but it isn't a something extravagant to make in my opinion. I just think the staff needs to be trained better in efficiency which I get because this place is new. 
I had the bbq tri tip, delish! The meat was a tad dry, and it really needed more bbq sauce, something with a kick. 
Potato salad, BOMB! Kinda reminded me of L&L macaroni salad flavors. A+!
Macaroni-good, I make better. But pairs really great with the food 
Bacon burger-hubby scarffed it down so I was not able to have a bite, but he said it was amazing! 
Will be back, hopefully next time we have a better experience. They need to have a menu online or available on yelp/fb. Would love to just call the order in to prevent waiting so long"}
{"text":"Went here after a long day.  I normally go next door to Sweet Poke but didn't feel like sushi tonight. I wanted a green chile burger but they didn't have so I got the Blue Cheese burger and their fries.  

Super yummy.  You can tell this is a quality burger with fresh toppings.  I was a little taken aback by the mustard (little too much for me) but the flavors were all still there. 

The staff - well - they need to go next door and take a lesson from the butcher side (happy, smiley, knowledgeable, friendly) because no smiles, when I asked questions the face said it all. 

My son did say it best - when you get food that actually looks like the picture and yummy - I guess it's ok to be sour."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and had a pretty darn good cold sandwich.  Was wanting a hot one but they are remodeling or something and they weren't available.  I would come back."}
{"text":"Great service! We tried the French dip and the Trip Tip sandwiches, both really tastey. The french fries are like a thick curly fry and also very good. Great variety of meats and cheeses in the deli, after we ate our sandwiches and sampled some of the salad options (I'd highly recommend you try the broccoli salad and the macaroni salad) we bought some fresh sliced pepperoni and mozzarella. We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I apologize for only 2 stars but, the service was not the best & we were the ONLY customers in the place. With that said you think they would have gotten our side orders correct....wrong. We got old chips instead of the Mac & Cheese. My son wanted only lettuce on his burger & it came  with everything. My Pastrami was tasty but smaller then what I expected & old chips.  Needless to say my expectations were not met on this visit.

It's frustrating to see someone invest hundreds of thousands of dollars into a business only to see it fail because the employees fail to take care of their customers. 

The store was clean & beautiful ...... But, I really don't think I'll return. Maybe we'll try again in a few months after the staff gets more experience.

Good Luck !!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here a couple times with my brother and friends. It's a hot/cold deli sandwich kind of shop. Their fries are bomb. The brisket sandwich was ok. Next time I'll just order the burgers."}
{"text":"I've been purchasing my Thanksgiving turkey from the Butcher Block for years, and have had the deli on my list for a while now. My husband and I stopped in for lunch and grabbed a couple of sandwiches...had we wanted the same thing we could have definitely split something!


I got a chicken sandwich and it was enormous! My husband's pastrami was pretty hearty too. Neither of us were fond of the macaroni salad, but there are lots of other options for the combo. 

I grabbed a menu to take home, as they are so convenient to our house and have a pretty large variety of options. Lunch was less than $30 and we left STUFFED!"}
{"text":"O.M.G! This place is so good! I'm a bit of a sandwich snob. And when I want an Italian deli sandwich portasubs and subway and the like leave me lacking. I saw this place on Yelp, and saw they use Boars Head products. Already a plus. I stopped off today and picked up lunch for my husband and I. I'm in love. The food is amazing, the people were friendly, and wait was really short for fresh to order sandwiches. I got myself the Block sandwich and my husband the hot pastrami on rye and ordered the BBQ egg rolls for us to share. All of it was great. 

Now the only things I would like to see changed are personal preference I guess. Still a 5 star rating. 
1 - I hated that the only menu that they had to look over was taped do their counter, I felt like I was holding up the cashier and the person behind me because I was a newbie to this place and had no idea what to order. I had to let the customer behind me know she could go ahead and that I was still looking. If there had been a menu I could take and look at and return, I wouldn't have felt so rushed to make a decision. 

2- the BBQ egg rolls are good. But the sauce with them is not the right pairing. It needs to be like a ranch BBQ or BBQ type sauce. It's this weird thousand island type dressing that just doesn't really work with the pork."}
{"text":"Excellent brisket sammich. Good price for great food. I'll absolutely be returning here. A great deli and smokehouse plus a full butcher shop.  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I had the Rubin not that good sorry and one tore up menu taped on the counter that's hard to read,I won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for my first visit to this place. Ordered the pastrami sandwich. It took about 10 minutes to be able to order because the owner or manager was too busy putting change into the cash drawer (repeatedly asking the employee if he needed more pennies, nickels, dimes, ones, fives, etc).

Finally got to place my order. Sat down to wait for it to be prepared. Every single table was dirty. The floors had all kinds of stuff all over them. It just was not a clean place.

My order arrived after about a ten minute wait. It was ok. Nothing to write home about. Could not keep the sandwich held together to save my life. Had to eat most of it with it fingers. Not much care given to a $10 sandwich.

As I was eating, I observed another employee go on break back in the dining room. She went into the restroom while holding her phone (watching a video). She came out a few minutes later still watching the video on her phone. There is no way she washed her hands.

There's a tv on in the dining room. It had cartoons playing. So either this is for the staff's kids to watch while they're working, or staff is smoking pot in between customers.

When I was leaving, I observed the husband and wife owners leaving the store to walk down to the 7-11. So I know they could have seen all the same things that I did. Yet they did nothing to manage their own business.

Seriously what is wrong with businesses these days? How can you invest and open a restaurant then let it go to crap? Is the business of selling Boars Head meat that good that you feel that no cleanliness or proper management is necessary?

Sorry but I won't be returning. Honestly I feel like I could get a better and cleaner experience at Subway."}
{"text":"After a few visits and recommendations i was impressed. My last visit was not as impressive.  I always order the Turkey Reuben, but this time i wanted to try the Cornbeef Reuben sandwich. The cornbeef was very salty only had a couple bites and I called the store to notify them of this and asked if I could get maybe just a half of a turkey Reuben this one was too salty she told me that she will call her manager and let me know that was a month ago and not a manager has yet to call? That was a month ago!"}
{"text":"The food was good. The problem is it took over 10 minutes to order and there was only one other customer in front of me. It then took over 25 minutes to get my food. I was in the deli for over half an hour before I could eat a sandwich."}
{"text":"I waited at the sandwich part of the deli for ten minutes before the man came out and said he'd take care of one customer before coming back to prepare my sandwich. The man never returned instead he continued taking orders in the butcher shop even though he knew I was waiting. This place is understaffed and the customer service was terrible. I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"These are the closest to NY sammiches I can find in Vegas. If you're from back home and you come here this will def be your best bet for a nice 1"}
{"text":"My boyfriend suggested we try the deli after he purchased some amazing steaks and garlic cheese from the butcher shop so we did, but we were less than thrilled. 

We ordered the BBQ egg rolls, Inferno Burger and the Grilled Chicken sandwich. The BBQ egg rolls were the only thing worth the $30 tab for 2 people. They had great flavor, came with a sweet sauce and were served fresh and cheesy, an excellent choice. The chicken sandwich tasted like rubber. I asked my boyfriend if it maybe wasn't cooked all the way through but he thinks the texture was from being frozen. Anyhow, not an enjoyable grilled chicken which for something so simple, is impressive to mess up. The sidewinder fries were crispy but somehow managed to come out lukewarm. Maybe the fries finished before the sandwich and sat there until then? The Inferno burger definitely had kick but wasn't anything to write home about. The fries served with the burger were also lukewarm. The bonus is that you can get a beer with your meal but if you don't like 1 of the 4 unique canned soda options, I don't remember the brand, you're screwed as there is no fountain drink machine with more mainstream soda options.

After our lunch, we took a look at the butcher side... Unsure if they got a bad batch of poultry but everything in the poultry case looked old and unappetizing and rubbery like the grilled chicken I just had. The red meat cases looked more fresh and definitely looked like the better bet. There was quite a few unique options in the freezer that had potential as well. 

Overall, the deli side kitchen needs to work on freshness and timing for meals and the butcher side looks good for red meat and I'll hope they get better poultry before the next visit."}
{"text":"Great place for a good sandwich. Brisket and pulled pork sammiches are pilled high! great flavors and the fries were yummmm aswell!"}
{"text":"there was only 1 other customer in the place getting lunch besides my wife and I. They still managed to take FOREVER to get the food. I will admit that it was the 4th of July weekend though, so they were having massive amounts of butcher business. My sandwich was soggy on the bottom bread with the slaw they had on there. My wifes sandwich was on point and she loved it. The Frys were pretty good too. Prices were average. I have not tried the butcher shop yet, but I 100% plan to give it a solid try. Very clean place, everyone was really nice."}
{"text":"My first time in and I was disappointed that they didn't get my order right.  I had ordered a sandwich with white sharp cheddar cheese and it came with yellow.  In addition to the dijonnaise that was already on the sandwich, I asked for mayonnaise as well, because there is nothing worse than a dry sandwich.  After removing the cheese that I did not like, I still found it to be dry, although the it could have been really tasty if it had included the ingredients I ordered.  Next time I will have to be more clear when I order.  The young man who was working was not very personable and I immediately got the feeling that he did not get it right.  I chalked it up to the fact that he probably had a long day and was tired, as it was almost 8 p.m.  Not the greatest first impression, but I might try it again, especially when I'm not in a rush to get to the airport."}
{"text":"This is the best place for a quick bite!!!! Their food is delicious and the fries are to die for! I also really enjoy the folks that work there. Their customer service is phenomenal and the people are so friendly. You will not be disappointed if you come here! I recommend the pulled pork sandwich"}
{"text":"Solid sliced Smoked Beef Brisket sandwich.  Probably the best I have had in Vegas for sure.  You can tell this meat has been handled meticulously throughout.  I'm pretty sure these Brisket are cooked (smoked) a day or two in advance then cooled to be prepared and served.     Steamed and sauced to perfection after being thinly sliced on a meat slicer.  My sandwich had at least a 1/2 lb or more of tender brisket piled high and sauced with a KC style BBQ sauce.  Served on a tasty toasted sesame onion bun.  The bread was fresh and held together very nicely with the large portion of meat.  I'm not sure the baker of this bread but it had a great onion flavor.  For $10.99 you get this healthy size sandwich and a 6oz side.  I chose the house made American potato salad because I like the mayo mustard flavor.  This one was but could have used bigger chucks of onion and pickle. Otherwise a solid recipe.  

The new and clean facility has seating for about 40-45 people with both 4 top tables and a bar counter area. Also available on the menu was a selection of cold subs sliced fresh to order using Boar's Head meats and cheeses, along with hot subs like a french dip, burgers, and pulled pork.  This is not Subway so expect to wait while your sandwiched is prepared by real \"sandwich artists\".  If your in a hurry and can't be patient.... go somewhere else. 

The deli/restaurant  is conected to a full service butcher shop offering everything from ground beef, to femur bones for marrow, to frog legs.  Beef choices were fresh at fair and market prices. They also carry house made sausages in traditional and unique varieties.  Other prepackaged meats were also available in their refrigerated section. 

Can't wait to try other menu items. Enjoy!

Had the French Dip today. Oh so good! Thinly sliced beef left to char on the griddle until it's crispy on the edges. Yumm!  The meat was tender and juicy and the cheese gooey and melted.  The French roll nicely toasted. Man this sandwich is beautiful.   

I also tried the craft beer Sidewinder fries.  My new favorite way to eat potatoes.  They were perfectly crispy fried. You must try these when you get here."}
{"text":"I had a brisket sandwich here that was so delicious! I typically don't like barbecue sauce on my meats, but the sauce on my sandwich was just right! There was plenty of meat too!

My husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich. They forgot the cole slaw on the sandwich, but we didn't find out until he had already driven home. Ugh. They said they would give him another sandwich when we called and spoke to Kiki, but who wants to drive back? Oh well. But, he did say it was yummy.

As for their sides, we ordered mac & cheese, beans, and fries. Beans were great and I'm not a bean fan. Fries were yum! They were big and cheap. Mac & cheese had no flavor. It was the most bland mac & cheese ever! Salt and pepper couldn't fix it. Skip on that!

I would definitely go back here to try more of their menu items, just be sure to check your items before leaving."}
{"text":"Good food here, I got the French dip sandwich. Definitely one of the tastier ones I have ever had. The red potato salad was amazing! The girl with the short hair who delivers food could have a better personality. Other than that the quality was really good"}
{"text":"I like this place when it was in the old location, they where fast and great quality. Well now I'm the new location, it seems they have no clue on how to
Run their bigger location. 1 guy to take orders, and he's the same guy that makes the sandwiches. It's been 30 mins and still no sandwiches. So if your in a hurry don't come here! This makes me sad because they make good subs but when we are late to getting back to work it's very upsetting! And the guy is taking his sweet time like he doesn't know how to make them. Not his fault, I'm assuming the manager doesn't know how to staff a full service deli. Maybe in 6 months I'll try again."}
{"text":"Well, just like everyone else in vegas nobody listens. Ordered a brisket sandwich and was given pulled pork. Took one bite and threw it away. Wasn't what I asked for. Went 10 minutes before close today, and although I felt slightly rushed I now know they just wanted to leave. Couldn't even be bothered to listen to what I ordered. Can't rate the food bc I threw it away. Going to get poke next door, they never mess up my order. Doubtful I will return. 

Unfortunately my diet gives me 1 cheat meal, this was a waste of time. I did try the red potato salad. Pretty bland, I've made better."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to trying this place ever since I saw the signage go up during a stop at nearby Coco Donuts. After my first visit, I have to say I am very impressed and I will definitely be back to try more!

(+) Enjoyed the tri-tip sandwich with a side can of diet coke. The sandwich was outstanding! The sauce packed plenty of flavor and the meat was tender and juicy! Nothing like a sloppy, saucy BBQ meat sandwich!
(+) I am not thrilled that there are no fountain drinks. They do serve their drinks from cans you grab from the cooler, BUT at least the cans are fairly priced t 99 cents! I can rattle off plenty of places that only serve cans, but gouge the *&^% out of you at $2 or $3 a can! Not here.


The sandwich does come with a choice of a side and I chose Mac and cheese (of course). The mac and cheese was alright, if not spectacular. It was the creamy variety, but in a relatively modest portion.

The dining/ sitting area is deceptively large and spacious. Plus there  are a handful of TV's with CNN, ESPN, etc playing for your entertainment. 

Prices are competitive. Not cheap, but not too bad either.

I enjoyed my first experience here and will definitely be back. I am anxious to try some of their cold sandwich selections as well. I would definitely recommend checking this place out.


4 solid stars.

I will be back."}
{"text":"We have been 10 times in the last month. Great food and service!!!! If you haven't tripped the tori-tip sandwich I would highly suggest it!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch a little nervous because some of the bad reviews. But I had a nice experience. I looked at the menu before showing up so I already knew what I wanted. But a was greeted quite fast. And was only in there for about 10 min. Both associates who I interacted with were friendly and had good customer service. 
After finishing half the sandwhich it's definitely worth trying out. Very filling. I only wish there was a little bit more peppers and pickles on mine but that's a personal preference. There was a nice amount of oil and vinegar. You could taste it but it wasn't dripping all over the place. And a great amount of meat on it (I got the butcher block)
I will definitely be coming back and trying some of the other sandwiches and sides. :)"}
{"text":"There's not a lot of delis around this area so I was very pleased to see that this placed opened up. It is located very conveniently across from the smiths plaza. It's very close to where I live, so this place became my go-to for cold cut meat and cheese! I've had the mushroom burger and it's very juicy and flavorful but it didn't have any veggies, which I knew before ordering. Since I took it to-go I added veggies when I got home and it tasted delicious. The fries are also yummy and something I would probably crave every once in a while. I also tried the pasta salad, which I wasn't a big fan of. The only complaint I would have is that they seem to get orders wrong. We ordered the grilled cheese, but instead received the burger version which was upsetting because my friend is a vegetarian. They have a few sandwiches that have the same name but one with meat and one without mean, so be careful and make sure to specify which version you would like."}
{"text":"There is no room for improvement, they are TOP NOTCH!!!! Everything is so fresh and made in shop! They constantly add new fantastic things to the menu! Always delicious! Worth the drive for me!"}
{"text":"Great food, RUDE staff.  I've been here a handful of times and always enjoyed the food and experience.  Today I went in with my Wife, 6 month old daughter and dad who was in town and left embarrassed too have brought anyone here.  I ordered a burger that said it came with onion strings and the burger didn't have any on it.  Not a huge deal at all but my wife wanted BBQ sauce so she went up and asked about it and they said they'd bring them out.  A few minutes later we are hearing swearing in kitchen and this extremely rude employee (Off the receipt I believe his name was Benjamin) walks out the kitchen door and  loudly states \"Who wanted Onion Strings?\" I answer to that, that was me.  He then says \"We don't have flour, you can't have onion strings\" and walks away, the nature in which he stormed out and said it was extremely unprofessional and unapologetic. It's not that onion strings are such a big deal but it is on your guys menu, it wasn't a speciality request.  I walked up front to tell him I won't be coming back and didn't appreciate how he was rude to our table, it's on their menu.  He rolled his eyes at me, told me he wasn't rude and gives me a big thumbs up to not coming back.  Then later he was giving our table dirty looks.  Another employee came over and apologized for him as we were leaving.  I will never come back as long as they hire rude employees like we experienced."}
{"text":"I ordered the BBQ Pulled Chicken, it was filled with flavor! A bit on the sweet side though but still delicious! The portion size was huge filled with the meat and coleslaw !!! Their macaroni salad was good too! The only thing is if you are in a hurry you may want to place an order ahead of time because you can easily wait there for 15-20 mins."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise! We intended to get a quick bite at the Mexican grill inside of Sinclair gas station while getting our cash washed. The grill ended up closed, so my husband and I journeyed down to the Chip off the Block to check it out while we waited for our car. WE ARE SO GLAD WE DID! We shared a BBQ Brisket sandwich and it was amazing!! The black sesame bun and generous brisket are a marriage made in heaven. The bun was soft and the density just right. The amount of brisket was hearty and the meat cooked just right. The manager came by to ask us how we were doing and we gave her two thumbs up. She asked Kiki behind the counter to give us a small sample of their various prepared salads. We ended buying a pound of each. The Chicken salad is light on mayonnaise and so fresh. The Pineapple coleslaw has the perfect sweetness and flavors were so unexpected. The roasted cauliflower salad with Parmesan was also divine! We skipped our grocery store visit and ended up buying 3 lbs of the herb chicken to cook! An update will follow after we cook that. What a great addition to our neighborhood. We will definitely be repeat customers."}
{"text":"Have been about 10 times and ordered about 8 different items. The food is disgustingly good, staff is friendly. And they didn't mind me ordering food with my pup."}
{"text":"Every time we come here, the service gets better and better. The people here are so nice, the food is incredible! I can't believe it's lunch time right now and it's not a madhouse! This is by far, one of my favorite places to eat. I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Great tasting sandwiches. They put a lot of meat on them, and it's from their Boar's Head counter so it tastes legit. Kind staff, nice eating area."}
{"text":"I love trying new sandwich places and we just moved to this area. The lady at the front was disengaged. I understand service is less than what is used to be. But at least smile and greet me. I asked if the salads were all made today. Her answer: no. Not no not today but yesterday or we have a two day policy. Nothing. Just no. I ordered a chip of the block. She made it. Incredibly dry. The chain sandwich places do it better. I bought the meal and she said nothing about the drink so I asked if I should grab one. Her answer: yes. If you don't like your job, quit. Not to mention I over heard the guy in the back coaching her about leaving the heat lamp on all night. Won't be back. Gave 2 stars because the meat was fresh."}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich shop in Vegas. The service is amazing, the food is great. Seriously, you REALLY get what you pay for. The sandwiches are huge! The employees are all super nice! I'm really glad I came here. To be honest, I don't like trying new things, but I'm glad I came here! I will come as often as I can!"}
{"text":"Trying this place for the first time since I love the butcher attached to it.

Gotta say I'm not too impressed. Ordered the Wagyu burger, boyfriend ordered the pastrami sandwich and we got a tri-color pasta to share.
Waited 20 minutes for our takeout order. Which isn't that bad if the food was above par but when I got home, which is only a 2 minute drive. The fries were cold because they aren't in closed containers, little paper baskets. And the bottom bun of my burger is so soggy it's inedible. Gave me paper thin sliced onions, three of them. Paper thin tomatoes, one. And the burger isn't hot.

Boyfriend said the pastrami is pretty good. Good flavor and was hot.

Overall I wouldn't go back here. Just didn't do it for me like I thought a place with such access to great cuts of meat."}
{"text":"First time here.  Very clean establishment, friendly staff and our sandwiches were delicious!  Their selection of fresh cut meats, etc, looked really good.  We plan to come by next time we feel like firing up the grill for some steaks."}
{"text":"Burgers & philly steak are bommmb. I haven't been able to try anything else besides them yet because I'm to addicted. Everything is Especially good when Elijah is working. He's by far the best cook & has great personality. Definitely worth your time to give this place a chance. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Chip Off The Block Deli on South Rainbow has been introduced adjacent to the new location for The Butcher Block (Fresh Meats and Seafood) store previously located three blocks north on South Rainbow.
 
The deli has a large selection of sandwich meats, cheeses, salads and side dishes. Also an eat in area for enjoying hot or cold sandwiches. Cold soft beverages in cans are also available.
Prior to purchasing our meats and seafood next door we decided on some lunch. The Big Hot Dog and a Pulled Pork Sandwich. The Big Dog comes with onions, mustard and a pile of chile and includes french fries. The hot dog is all beef. The french fries are a cut that I have not seen before, shaped like the letter U. Very good fries, not greasy.

The Pulled Pork Sandwich is piled high with nicely smoked meat and topped with Cole Slaw. This is Memphis style, just the way I make it at home. The sandwich comes with french fries but I substituted for a side of beans. The beans had a mild flavor and and mixed in was some pieces of pork.

We will be planning our trips to the butcher shop to facilitate having a sit down lunch at The Chip Off The Block Deli.
Congratulations to Ron and Jeannette on the opening of their new and expanded stores on South Rainbow."}
{"text":"Is this place open? Went here twice once at 1 pm and the other today at 11:30 am both times the door was locked. Also, the sign has been up that they are only doing cold subs... Live this place but we need consistency"}
{"text":"Really excited to try this place but ended up being very disappointed, both burgers we ordered ended up being burnt, like pretty much inedible. Giving two stars because the loaded potato skins were pretty tasty"}
{"text":"Mediocre. Service was a little slow and disinterested.

I had the French dip with peppers and onions, no real flavor. Sandwich was pretty meh. Au Jis was good. I'd say the French dip as Which Which is better.

French fries tasted like they had been cooked in old oil.

I really wanted to like this place so will return and hope for better, however I'm not confident it will be better.

Worst of all, it's 84 degrees outside today and the dining area was uncomfortably warm."}
{"text":"They are friendly. The food is pretty rough though. The steak burger had good flavor, however, there was a ground artery in it... The butcher shop is also a little strange. I have never been in butcher shop that has frozen, not fresh, meat throughout the counter...we won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been here on multiple occasions for my cold sandwich desires. Deli's that slice their own meat in shop have a huge edge over Subway's or Jimmy John's. The produce are usually more fresh, better quality meats and ingredients are used. You have a better variety of side choices to go with yor sandwich other than potato chips here at Chip Off the Block."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem & soooo amazing! It's very clean, the food (subs) tasted so good and honestly is the best sandwich I've had in a long time. They have great options for sides, and they carry Dr Browns soda which is kind of unique. Marcella was our cashier she has the long black hair and red lipstick, sweetest woman in the world and she made the experience that much better. Looking forward to getting meat at the Butcher block for my future BBQ's!!!! & the price was extremely fair! $10 a sub or so, which I could only eat half in one sitting."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We had 15 people with us that these three guys, Elijah (the head cook), Sean and Gary (we asked for their names to make sure they got the recognition for this post) handled all our delicious food very quickly. I was extremely impressed with the quality of food. They use Boar's head meat for their subs and the bread is great! Their brisket, side winders and Mac and cheese is incredible. They had wonderful service on top of the food. I wish we lived closer so we could come back all the time."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars for quality of ingredients and effort.  I am rooting for this place.  Nice to have an 'independent' sandwich shop near work that stocks everything from pork neck bones...to alligator!  Big fan of much of what they are doing at this place.    

I hope management reads these reviews, however, because I do have a few suggestions/requests that I think would improve this place:

1. Please stock and supply CHERRY PEPPERS - sometimes called 'pepper relish' out here in Vegas.  I believe this is a sandwich must.  Capriottis has them. 

2. Not a fan of the  of slicing the sub or hoagie bread all the way through - this makes for a very messy eat.  

3. Not a fan of shredded lettuce, mostly for the same reason as No. 2.  

As someone who grew up in the Philadelphia area, I like to think of myself as a 'sandwich connoisseur,' and so I think the foregoing suggestions are generally applicable (p.s. nice to see scrapple at COTB!).  That said, I suppose I can make personal requests to account for all of the above...except those cherry peppers.  I just hope COTB starts to stock them...!"}
{"text":"First time here.

Got the pulled pork with a side of sweet potato tots.

The food was brought out to me fairly quick.

Generous portion between the buns. Slaw was tasty. The sauce was a bit too sweet for me but what're ya gonna do?

The sweet potato fries were great! Overall decent spot.

Probs'll be comin' back for that brisket!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say this place was a big disappointment.  My buddy and I went in on a Sunday morning for 2 sandwiches and side of Cole slaw......we were the only ppl in the place and it took 30 mins to get 2 sandwiches.......while checking out my buddy wanted a pickle which was $1.00......he gave her a $5 bill but she had no change......after waiting an additional 5 mins for change we finally just walked out with our $5 pickle.

Got home and had two very average sandwiches on bread that was fresh but no crust or bite to it......and who puts Dijonaise on a $14 \"Gourmet ITALIAN Sub\"?

Sorry guys hope your burgers are better."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches, burgers and deli selections. This place I'm sure will be featured on the Food Network soon!"}
{"text":"They have really done a lot of work with getting Food out correctly.  Their first 6 months virtually every single item I ordered was entirely incorrect.  None of the cooks even knew what was on their menus, that means incorrect training from Mgmt.  They have done a much better job lately and the food there is excellent"}
{"text":"Sooo  good. Finally a place with good hot sandwiches. Had the french dip and it was meaty and delicious. Can't wait to try their bbq brisket or other sandwiches. Yummm"}
{"text":"Great quality food and good customer service...waited a bit to order and for food to come out though. I had hot dog, potato salad, and pulled pork egg rolls. All very good. I will be back next time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Forget about Jhonnie Pastrami in LA!   This is the best Pastrami on the west coast!  Ya'll it still has the fat on it!  YESSSSSSS Ya'll YESSSSSS!  Who wants a lean meat Pastrami?  Not me, if you don't know how a pastrami taste with the fat on it, you need to check this place out!  I've been so disapointed looking for the right pastrami, and this is the place got it right.  There were even pieces that was cooked kinda hard, but it seemed like it was bacon, but it was the pastrami.  And the fries were amazing.  The customer service was great!  They said they have another location, on Rainbow and Robindale, but the deli isn't up yet!  So give it a few weeks, the deli should be up and running."}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches  here. Quality  of meats are  great and service  is awesome. But don't set your hours and close 1/2 hour earlier  than time posted"}
{"text":"Amazing tri-tip sandwich! Can't wait for them to open up the Henderson location. Melissa was very friendly and helpful even though she was extremely short staffed. Since they didn't have an appetizer we wanted she offered us a soda on the house. Friendly staff and great food make this place 5 stars in my book!!! Thanks Melissa!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here because the gyro place was closed.  Paid $34 for 3 lunches that were all horrible.  1st wanted a Reuben but they were out of sauerkraut.  Then asked about the grass fed burger.  Didn't have it and had limited burger selection.  Husband got a hot pastrami and it had coleslaw on it (haven't ever had a hot pastrami sandwich with coleslaw on top).  I had the French Dip and it was indeed, as another reviewer said, a Philly cheese steak sandwich with Au jus, not nice slices of roast beef but chopped Philly cheese steak. Then was told (after ordering) they didn't have provolone (what kind of deli is this?) for my steak sandwich so had to use Gouda instead.  Was told the chicken sandwich would take 20 minutes because it was so thick.  The chicken didn't even cover the bun and was thin.  No flavor to the food at all.  Very disappointed.  I will say the front register lady was very friendly but anything you wanted was practically shot down.  Never again."}
{"text":"So glad they opened a deli! These guys really know what they're doing. I had a Pastrami Rueben on white bread. It was stacked high with good quality pastrami and the battered 'fries' were awesome. They serve a variety of Dr. Browns soda's, which are hard to come by these days. 

The only thing I would suggest they do would be the get a smoker and start smoking/grilling their meats in front of the shop. It would be great to stop off on the way home and pick up a cooked tri-tip for dinner (or ribs, hot links, etc.). The smell driving by would generate more traffic, too. People don't want to grill or smoke (meats) during these hot vegas summers. It would just be an added bonus."}
{"text":"The mains are fantastic. Really good BBQ. The sides are pretty basic with limited flavor"}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE. 
I get so excited when I'm on this side of town because I know I'm close to this place. 
If you don't know already, on one side of the building is the deli, where you can order delicious meat (try the salmon jerky, it's to die for), and the other side is for ordering food. 
There are so many great choices on the menu. I personally love any of the bbq sandwiches. The pulled pork is so good. I recently tried their cheesesteak and fell even more in love with this place. 
If you get the chance to try their fries, DO SO! Same with any of their yummy sides, like potato salad or even their dessert potato salad, if they still serve it. 
Everything here is fresh, real and made with care, so be prepared for a wait. Your belly will thank you."}
{"text":"Have gone here a couple times since the Butcher Block has reopenned down the street. they have a wide array of hot and cold sandwiches as well as some hot apps and some hot and cold sides. i have had the French Dip which was very good and the Grilled cheese on texas toast which was really good as well. The Burger was great and the fries are unique and tasty. Overall this is a great deli for lunch and probably better than capriottis down the street. I will be a frequent patron .

Service- the service on the deli side can leave a little to be desired. The deli opened only a bit ago so we should give them a little time to get it together .both times i have been orders were a little screwed up and the food took a while to get."}
{"text":"Very slow very expensive especially when you ask repeatedly for your order to be a certain way. And BOTH sandwiches were made wrong. Mine made me sick. Definitely will not return. I had high hopes for this place too because I love Boars Head Deli meats. Very very disappointed. The guy that took my order was friendly but I wish he could've gotten my order right. I'll make my own sandwiches from now on. Or go to Jimmy Johns they've never messed up my order don't see what's so hard about it. One no mayo. Simple. COVERED DRIPPING IN MAYO. 2nd they added my peppers and mustard to her sandwich. When she doesn't like spicy. But we left no refund no remade sandwiches. We were starving and tired of waiting so long for our already made wrong sandwiches. I just wanted to leave. So we had to stop somewhere else for food on our way home and pay even more money. But hey at least they got our order right!"}
{"text":"This place is connected to the butcher next door. A huge selection of sandwiches, sides and even burgers.  We had the pulled pork sandwich and the brisket sandwich. They were tender and yummy.  Might have been a tiny bit too much sauce for me, but that is a personal preference.  Potato salad and coleslaw were spot on. Service is a little slow, so don't come if you are in a hurry!"}
{"text":"This place is super yummy and the fam and I are big fans of the butcher shop it's connected too!! We came around noon when it wasn't too busy but the place filled up quick! We got the chicken sandwich and the inferno burger to go which probably wasn't the best idea since the sauce on the sandwiches made the buns really mushy. The girls working the front could of been friendlier but oh well.. I really like this place and I hope they do well.. I almost forgot, the potato wedges or fries or chips or whatever they call them are soooo delicious!!! I burnt my tongue eating them while they were too hot but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"By far the best brisket sandwich I've had hands down.  The deli is great with all boars head meats and the pasta salad and broccoli salad are on point.  Plus the butcher side had amazing cuts of meat.  The 1855 ribeyes are amazing and the spicy tumbled filet is to die for.  Best butcher, deli and sandwich shop in Vegas by far."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE! Every time I come here the ladies working at the register ALWAYS seems to have an attitude. 
Anyways this particular time I had ordered a chicken sub and while I was eating it I kept pulling out PIECES OF PLASTIC FROM  INSIDE  MY SANDWICH. RHow are you preparing a sandwich and not see what the fuck you're doing? So anyways I go back up there to tell the woman who made my sandwich what had happened she DID NOT once APOLOGIZE OR OFFER ME A REFUND for having to come all the way back down there, she was also acting like she could care less & I'm pretty sure the other guy working, overheard me and told the owner what had happened as I could see them in the back talking and looking right at me. THE OWNER DID NOT EVEN THINK TO COME TALK TO ME OR APOLOGIZE FOR SUCH A HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE... BOTTOM LINE SPEND YOUR MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE SERVICE AND QUALITY OF FOOD BEING PREPARED!!"}
{"text":"My Bf got the meatball sub and said it was pretty good. I got The Brisket burger and it was amazing!! So juicy and savory. I also got sweet potato tots on the side and those were good too. Highly recommend it! Workers were friendly and I enjoyed the lemon water."}
{"text":"Worst pastrami sandwich ever

I went there a month ago to get deli meat but the case was empty. I got a pastrami sandwich instead. It was THE worst pastrami sandwich I've ever had. I don't know how they did it but the pastrami was the fattiest and gristly pastrami I've ever had. Worst part was that it cost me $12. They should just close the deli side and keep the butcher side open. The butcher side is really good but apparently that doesn't translate to the deli side."}
{"text":"I think this is a good place to grab a fresh deli meat sandwich. It's connected to an actual butcher and they have a large variety of meats to select from. There is seating to indulge yourself right there when u receive your food or you can take to go. The sides selection is very scarce either Fries or antipasta as the young lady calls it but the only minus for me is the lack of viewing the sandwiches they offer its all off words or previous pics on yelp. There large screens are used to showcase the deli meats and cheeses you can purchase. But I am not allowing that from deterring me from the food."}
{"text":"I can normally handle poor customer service, and if my order is screwed up once in a while, but this place hit the trifecta today...

My wife and I ordered 2 brisket sandwiches, a Wagyu burger with sweet potato tots, and a full rack of rib meal from a lady who seemed to be having a rough day. A little attitude that showed she did not want to be there. We got home, and noticed that there were no sweet potato tots, and I only got a half rack though charged for a full rack. I'm usually pretty easy going and forgiving, however what happened there tonight caused me to write my first ever yelp review. 

After the lady took our order, she came into the dining area and appeared to take a little break.  During her break, she decided to take her shoe off and give herself a foot rub for a few minutes...gross. She then proceeded to get behind the counter and pull the signs out of the food in the deli counter...WITHOUT WASHING HER HANDS!!! I then saw my food coming up in the window that were in trays instead of to-go boxes. Before she can box up my food, I run to the counter and ask her to grab someone else to do it and described what I seen her do. She grabbed one of the butchers that was working with her who I then explained why he was boxing up my order, and she told him \"I wasn't going to touch his food.\"  That not only is extremely disgusting, but pretty embarrassing for her and the establishment. 

I've been here on several occasions and kept coming back because the food is pretty good. However, the poor customer service, screwed up order, and filthy behavior displayed by this lady in particular caused this place to lose a customer. My wife and my family will not be going back."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are awesome! Customer service great! The employees  seem to be great sandwich artists!! Food that tastes and looks good!!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me months ago, but I never had the chance to check it out until now. The deli side has a large menu hanging above the counter advertising sandwiches and such. Boar's Head is proudly displayed throughout which gave me some high hopes. The counter underneath was empty for the most part except for a rack of ribs that were available for purchase.

A gentleman came up to the front from the kitchen area and motioned for me to join him at the end of the counter. There on the counter was the full menu with additional items (Burgers) and a sheet with \"temporary hours.\" Those new hours are from 11am-7pm. I went with a pastrami sandwich to go and while waiting for the sandwich, I checked out the butcher section of the shop.

Sandwich is very delicious! There was some difficulty keeping the sandwich together while eating, but I am okay with a messy sandwich. Coleslaw was a little on the bland side, but didn't take away from the sandwich much. The wedges were good, nice and crispy from being freshly prepared."}
{"text":"The hype on the brisket sandwich is true.  It was very tasty and I loved the bun.  It does come slathered in BBQ sauce... a lot of BBQ sauce but it's still very good.  The mac n cheese side was done correctly and a very generous portion.  A can't wait for their new location to open down the road from me on rainbow and windmill."}
{"text":"Been my usual spot, for a sub, for half a year now. No gimmicks. No hipstery \"innovation\" or nonsense. These are classic deli subs, done the right way. My usual is their Italian. Sandwiches are generously stacked, and the Boar's Head meats are the best you're probably going to get, this far from the east coast. The hot sandwiches are great, too. I recommend any of their offerings with pastrami. The bread isn't amazing, but it ain't bad. Let's face it. It's hard to get decent bread in the desert. Definitely check out their crazy French fries. Staff are friendly, and the attached butcher shop is worth taking a look at."}
{"text":"Food is good. But I almost walked out. There is 1 person working and a line of people. That 1 person is the one that takes the orders AND makes the sandwiches. I've been here 15 minutes and he's just now starting to make my sandwich. Do not come here if you are in a hurry. Also... when dishing out samples (at least 3) he reached into the case, handled the spoons and served the samples with NO GLOVES ON. Thankfully he put them on to make the sandwiches. Finally got home with my to go order and the order is all wrong!!"}
{"text":"Great find! Fresh meat, sides and veggies. Great service. Going to make this a regular stop for lunch."}
{"text":"Close to my job so I decided to try this new place. They use Boar Heads products, which I love. I had a chicken sandwich with spicy meat, cheese and a spread on it. The sandwich was very tasteful and fulfilling. I will return here for lunch again. I recommend this little sandwich shop to anybody close to the area"}
{"text":"Obsessed with the butcher shop, it is definitely a hidden gem. I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"They have one of the best BRISKET SANDWICHES in Vegas! It is so Tasty! The meat melts in your mouth! And the Barbecue sauce they use is so good! Great service and cooks! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant/butcher just opened and the high expectations I had for a deli in a butcher shop were definitely met. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and without sounding hyperbolic it really was the best sandwich I've ever had. My side was the macaroni and cheese and again, some of the best mac and cheese I've had. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Finally a decent sandwich shop around my house! No more subway jersey Mike's, Panera or any chain sandwich places!!! This little sandwich spot is connected to a butcher shop so you can only imagine how tasty the meat is. They have such a variety of sandwiches to choose from and everything from the pulled pork to the crispy fish sandwich was beyond spectacular. Also have a few different house coleslaw's that you could choose from, or you could go with their signature house french fry just a cut I've never seen before."}
{"text":"I've eaten the pastrami, beef brisket, and the French dip sandwiches and all of them were awesome! Can't wait to try the rest of there sandwiches, I'm sure they are all delicious too. Those corkscrew fries are also very good too!"}
{"text":"We checked this place out because we were in the area for a supervisor conference. We had a group of 10 and found plenty of room for seating. Placing our orders was fairly quick and some of the food came out faster than others, definitely not in the order we paid but not a big deal. We ordered everything from the Reuben, Brisket, Pastrami sandwiches and cheeseburgers. I split the brisket and pastrami sandwich and had the sweet potato tots. The BBQ sauce on the brisket was a bit on the sweet side for me but the pastrami was delicious. No complaints about the reuben. The server warned us the burger was a little over cooked than what was requested and that the cook put on another burger if he wanted to swap it out (good customer service). The cashier/server also brought around 2 baskets of side samples. The samples included the macaroni salad, potato salad, red potato salad, coleslaw, jalapeno coleslaw, broccoli salad, and Italian salad. Definitely appreciated tasting thier other side options."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My work eats here all the time. Great food and fresh daily. Some of the freshest meat I have ever had. It reminds me of story's my grand mother would tell me how she would go down to the butcher to get her mom some meat. They cut cook and you can enjoy every bit inside there cosy little restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is so fresh and SO good! Great customer service, the lady at the counter was very inviting and knowledgeable. This food is INCREDIBLE."}
{"text":"So ridiculously Yummy!!! 
One of the very best French Dips I've ever had! 
We will be here often thats for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent meats, cheeses and breads. Sandwiches are delicious and they also have a large deli. They even have pork roll!!! (If ur from NJ like me you know that's awesome.) 

Why I'm docking them 2 stars is management's fault. I told the cashier I just want a pastrami sandwich, not a reuben, and it literally confused the CRAP out of her. It's because they have a reuben on the menu but it's called \"the pastrami.\" I told her that's a reuben (it has reuben ingredients) and I just want pastrami and American cheese, lettuce, etc and she was beyond confused. I was a supervisor in a deli for 4 years and let me tell u, it's very very common for people to order hot pastrami sandwiches. Management needs to add a simple pastrami sandwich to the menu (just like how my parents were able to order \"turkey sandwiches\" with no problem) and/or change the pastrami's name to a reuben, which it should be (it even comes on rye and had thousand island dressing.) So management needs to change the menu and/or train employees to understand what a reuben is - a very common sandwich. That's why I blame management. So three stars from me until the problem is fixed."}
{"text":"Elijah made the best sandwhich. Made my husband drive 30 min here for the Clubhouse and it was very well worth it!"}
{"text":"This is one of the newest butchery/deli restaurants opening in centennial. The concept sounds really good. Fresh boars head meats and a good selection of sandwiches, salads, burgers and even some bbq. We tried the chicken Teriyaki sandwich and the french dip. The Teriyaki sandwich was pretty good. I personally loved the grilled pineapple. The chicken was fresh and very tasty. The French Dips was a bit of a disappointment. The sandwich was a bit salty and the flavors weren't there. 

The service was also very mediocre. The employees would not go into detail about their products. They do not have soda machines or ice water, only soda cans and bottle waters. Overall, I was not thrilled with my experience. I felt it was hit or miss. The only cool thing I saw was their connection with their butchery. It makes it pretty convenient to go and buy fresh good quality meats after a quick meal."}
{"text":"May 10, 2017. 1pm
I was the only customer in and had no problem ordering my sandwich. The gentleman helping me was very thorough and let me know about their mayo/mustard mix, and reminded me of all the veggies that came on the sand which. I ordered no tomatoes, extra onions, extra mustard and it came out perfectly. 
I hate subways/portasubs/anything similar. The only other place i buy deli sandwiches from is Sprouts. 
Here, there's a great variety of subs and so many different Boar Head's meats to choose from.  
My sandwich was delicious and my service received was wonderful so I will be back to try another, and some potato salad! (Potato salad, mac salad, tomato salad..so much good looking sides!)
Also had to walk through the butcher side of it (I was starving and drooling) Talk about a selection of meat!!!!!! 
Definitely with coming in and checking inventory   
Thanks for the quality sub guys!"}
{"text":"Great service and even better food. We have had their delicious burgers several times and keep going back as it is the best we have found on this side of town. Also have purchased seafood to take and cook. Always fresh and tasty, definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Had the brisket sandwich and the meat was cooked to perfection, sauce was sweet and tasty, bun wasb uniquely perfect. Side winder fries are so yummy too. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Salad sandwich. The worst I have ever had ! All it had was small cutup diced chicken. To add to the no taste they only cut the sandwich in half partially. Will never return"}
{"text":"Holy sh*t that was an amazing brisket sandwich!! The fries were good too! Got an old fashioned cream soda. So yummy! They have a lot of other things on the menu that I can't wait to try."}
{"text":"Came in around 7pm on a Monday with my brother and he ordered a brisket sandwich. It was empty. The cashier spoke through the window at the cook and I heard him ask if he could make the sandwich quickly before he left. ((leave??? You guys have another hour before closing... who's making the food if the only cook there leaves..???)) 
I don't know, I guess that was just odd and confusing to me.

My brother forgot to ask for the sandwich to be cut in half, which the cook didn't do because I guess he was in such a hurry to leave. There was a lot of meat in the sandwich but the sauce was lacking, which affected the flavor. It was a mediocre sandwich that I would not purchase again. The fries were good; crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The meal cost around $11, which is a bit pricey for what you get.

Another point to add was that when we were waiting for our food, the owner or whoever seemed to be in charge was on the other side (the actual meat selling side) closing, since they close at 7. She saw that the cook left immediately after getting our sandwich done and was literally screaming at the cashier, asking him why he let the cook leave early and was yelling about how the trash \"hasn't even been taken out yet!!\" And the cashier was super chill and was saying how he'll take care of it. I also saw the cashier leave a little after we left, but again, I thought they close at 8???

Anyway, awkward environment and experience with food that was lacking. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and ended up buying some of their meats on the other side. The chicken was seasoned so good. The homemade bratwurst, my dad said it was one of the best he's had!"}
{"text":"Butcher shop was great and always has been.   The deli on the other hand I think I'd have better luck killing the animal,cleaning it and cooking it before I got served.   I had two kids with me and waited 30 minutes to get served.  Ill get lunchmeat from Smiths going forward."}
{"text":"Sandwich heaven!  Fresh cut Boar's Head meats and plenty of options for hot food.  Love the burgers and the pastrami is legit as well.  Go here if you're hungry, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"it is in the sw shopping area, the bbq meat is coming from next door, their parent company, try the bbq brisket, it is on a median size bun, taste delicious, portion is not that big though."}
{"text":"These guys are the best. Everything is fresh and tastes amazing. one of the best delis in vegas hands down. All the employees are super helpful and courteous. Get the butchers block sandwich and you won't be disappointed. Can't wait until the new location is open in the Southwest."}
{"text":"So excited for a great new lunch spot near work. Had the tri-tip sandwich and it was amazing. Ate the mac and cheese as a side - great flavor, but a little bit runny for mac and cheese. Eager to try many things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great Sandwiches, bit of a wait, but worth it.  No soft drinks only cans, still cool."}
{"text":"The food here is terrible. Order an organic burger and Ruben sandwich. The burger was bland and the bun was brunt so it tasted horrible, all I could taste was the burned bun. The Ruben sandwich was no better they use low Quality Meat on the Ruben  and it was very salty. I had a stomach ache all night after eating that nasty food!! We will NEVER GO BACK! Now we know why there are soo many bad reviews. Trust the bad reviews it's 100% TRUE!!!"}
{"text":"I don't usually complain. But I got the Wagyu burger and I expected it to be carefully cooked to perfection. But to my dismay, it was overlooked and even burnt on the bottom. With the money that I spent on good meat I should have made my own burger at home. The staff didn't even ask me how the food was knowing it was my first time here. I would not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"BBQ bacon burger was delicious! Patty melt was tasty. Mac and cheese was really good. Mac salad was ok. The French fries were really good. We will be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"This is a highly recommended place by me.  They've got a great selection of meats.  They do amazing burgers and sandwiches.   Great service and great prices.  Oh did I mention the nice selection of Boars Head....

Yum"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out for lunch and I was not disappointed. There is a small dine-in area and a wide variety of hot & cold sandwiches, salads (per lb) and sides. I had the Alaskan sole fish sandwich with red potato salad. The fish was perfect and juicy & I definitely recommend the red potato salad."}
{"text":"Decent food but even better service..the people were very friendly. We tried the brisket and that was delicious."}
{"text":"This was the worst deli experience I have ever had. It's crazy to think that on the opposite side of the restaurant is a great butcher experience. Ordered a philly steak sandwich and a pastrami to go. There was a party of three guys who ordered before I arrived and the lady behind the counter was apologizing it was taking so long and thanking them for their patience. I should have known. It took more than 15 mins to get my sandwiches. Twice the lady said thanks for your patience. When I finally received my sandwiches, I got home and opened them up. By FAR The worst pastrami I have ever seen.  Thick cut. Fatty. Tons of grizzle. Inedible. Ended up sharing my wife's Philly which was Edible but not great. The display counter in the deli was fully empty. Assume there is not enough business to keep the case full. Based on my experience I see why."}
{"text":"Came in and ordered three things for there, not to go. We sat down, and after 30 minutes we notice a family that had gotten there way afterwards, getting their food. I heard some confusion as in the family wasn't sure if it was their food or not, but the woman bringing it to them assured them it was. When they questioned again, and when I walked up to the counter, she realized she had given them our food which they had already started to pick at. She wasn't apologetic, and we were unwilling to wait another 30 minutes for our food to be made again. After a phone call to who I assume is the owner, we had our money refunded to us (per our request). Very disappointing experience as I had been wanting to try their brisket sandwich (they were out of brisket our first experience here about a week ago). Three stars for the food we had there on the first visit, which was delicious but does not fully make up for today."}
{"text":"The service here is friendly and nice food is amazing lady gave me some free broccoli to taste it was amazing"}
{"text":"That pastrami sandwich is the bomb digitty!  There have been a few times that I have gotten the french dip and they forgot my au jus..... which is annoying, but the sandwich is plenty good without it!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. I've been so excited for this place to open. Walked in and the store is very nice, and clean. I like that the deli is attached to a REAL butcher shop. Those are almost impossible to find anymore. We ordered The Cleaver, The Bird, The Rueben, a large container of red skinned potato salad, and a large container of macaroni salad to go. When we got home, we cut the sandwiches into shareable pieces so five of us could try a little of everything.  The Cleaver and The Bird were both huge hits. Very good. The Rueben had great flavor (I really loved the marble rye), but it was a bit too fatty and thickly sliced for my taste. I'd like it better if the meat was shaved more thinly. Potato salad needed a bit of pepper but was tasty, and the macaroni salad was surprisingly different. We really liked it. I'm looking forward to the building to begin smelling like smoked meats as time goes by. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"For me this is the better half of The Butcher Block;)  
It's quite simple really as why- no cooking, no mess!  
Boar's Head products abound and freshly made salads of your choice.  I gravitate towards their fresh heirloom tomato salad.  Did you go in earlier today and you think you perused over it. Absolutely not, I purchased the last two pounds this afternoon.  Go back tomorrow please, they open at 10am. Yes, it's that tasty:)
Attentive service today and always.  Sandwiches made to order or just simply order an array of those Boar's Head cold cuts and a couple of side salads to go.  Perhaps you can't wait- even better.  Get this, they have seating as well and tv entertainment while you try that heirloom salad!
Meats can be taken home or served on the spot.  Wait, why not both! Genius! So both is what you will be walking out the door with:)"}
{"text":"Had a burger here and it was really dry. I was expecting much more and sad to say I wouldn't repeat."}
{"text":"First time here there were 4 of us and we all got different things. Everything was delicious. The meat on the sandwiches was perfect. The fries were some of the best I had and the service was great. I highly recommend this deli!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with all of the sides, burgers and sandwiches in the deli portion of this place. Everything is constantly fresh and never disappoints. They have a fully equipped butcher shop with phenomenal filet mignon jerky (it's to die for) and other choices of jerky. It's also a place to find rare meats and cuts that are difficult to get at that level of freshness! Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. The lady in charge was incredible it's nice seeing a deli still place make it, she was very helpful, explained everything and recommended three different item. 
Brisket 
Tri tip 
Pulled pork.
Three guys so we chose all three my favorite was the pulled pork unreal flavors, was nice enough to bring us 5 samples of all different salads etc this place is the spot to eat BBQ.

Ck them out and I heard new locations in Henderson soon"}
{"text":"Sandwiches here are really good. I always get the one thats like an Italian... can't remember what it's called. I gave them 4 stars because it's them forever to make a sandwich. I started calling before I go so I don't have to wait."}
{"text":"in the last week

I'm giving them a 3 star based on how good the one in the South of Vegas is. I went to this one today because I go to the other one when I am at work. I ordered a French Dip for my wife, she has been in the hospital for 3 weeks with no food just a liquid diet, she has been dying for a French Dip. So I ordered her one got home and my wife says It's a philly cheese steak, and so I taste it and sure enough it's a philly cheese steak. So I call the store because maybe the made a mistake no problem, and I tell the guy on the line the mistake they made a philly for a French Dip; and he proceeds to tell me they're the same sandwich. If you can't tell the difference between a French dip and a philly cheese steak you shouldn't be making sandwiches at a store that sells sandwiches. Untill they get their act together I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This Sandwich Shop / Butcher is a find. Came in ordered The Pull Pork Sandwich it did not disappoint. So tasty no salt or pepper needed Also it was so big I had to take home Half of it. If you like coleslaw you must try the pineapple coconut coleslaw yummy. Over on the Butchers side there were all kind for fresh meat ready go.  From Aging beef to sea food.  The staff and owner are very friendly. It was nice to have someone take the time to make me feel welcomed I will be back"}
{"text":"My husband and I really liked this place the couple times we came. This last visit set me over the edge. 

I ordered a simple grilled chicken sandwich for my husband. It took them over 30 minutes. 
When I finally did get my order I asked the cashier \"does this sandwich normally take 30 min\"

Her response: \"it's the men cooks..they don't know what they are doing\"

Me: \"you're going to lose customers that way..I'm not coming back if I have to sit here for 30 min\"

Her: \"I don't blame you\" 
? what the hell!


Ehh not coming back"}
{"text":"This place has slowly gone downhill over the years. The customer service was always bad, but it was something you tolerated because the food was good. However, my last visit in Chip was just weird. Their frontline is spaced. They no longer offer any of the salads they used to in the front shelf. Their menu is now limited and they hide their stock menu behind the counter. No more free water for guests waiting. They made me the wrong sandwich. So many little things added up that made me question my loyalty to what used to be the best sandwich and fries in Centennial Hills"}
{"text":"We love going to the burgers next door (to cook at home) and always have had amazing service! Today we came in and got two kids meals and I repeated we needed the burgers med and they came out past well and with the wrong sides. They kindly remade the one burger we asked them too but took over 15 minutes and we where all done eating and my son had filled up on fries. 

On a lighter note brisket sandwich is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on the way to pick up the truck in hopes the hubby could have what looked like a good pastrami sandwich. Sadly they were only doing cold sandwiches saying that they are remodeling so I guess we'll have to come back! We both choose a cold sub and bag of chips and really enjoyed our selections of the club and roast beast. Checked out the butcher shop next door and defiantly will be coming back to get some of that in the future!"}
{"text":"Asked for the Rueben with just meat and cheese even confirmed that it just had just meat and cheese and got home and nope unable to eat it. What a waste of $11. I was the only person in your establishment and you still couldn't make my sandwich right. Thanks for nothing"}
{"text":"First time here I came here be for and got some fresh meat at the Butcher Block for a BBQ they was telling me they are going to start serving sandwiches on the other side I said cool I be back to try it out.. So I am here everything look so good!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a good sandwich. Came here because we were craving a good french dip sandwich and brisket and thought we should finally check it out. We came around 7pm a little before closing. There were a few tables dining and a couple people ordering cuts from the deli counter. I ordered the french dip with fries and hubby ordered brisket sandwich with fries. 

Both came out relatively quickly for how slow things seemed to be moving. Let me say, the the brisket was super juicy and flavorful! We both thought it was tasty. However, the real winner here was the french dip and the slow cooked all day au jus. To die for. So much flavor and oh so delicious. He was actually a little jealous and started dipping his fries in the au jus because it was so good. 

It is a little steep in price, but something I would expect from a small run shop with quality ingredients. Service can be a little slow when waiting to order, but nothing too crazy. Definitely a place we've been back to repeatedly!"}
{"text":"Chip off the block deli has really dropped the ball! A couple months ago they had a large menu with amazing food, They now have cut the menu down to a handful of items and the quality has gone down the drain."}
{"text":"I walked in tonight and the whole deli is gone.  No more sandwich meats, potato salad, mac and cheese, ceviche.  And the menu was about half of what is was.  I will not be back for the restaurant.  The butcher has always been fantastic, it is a shame they screwed up the restaurant."}
{"text":"Live close to this place and it looked awesome. My wife and I both got the brisket sandwiches.   They were completely inedible. Literally 90% fat. Nasty waste of $20."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh sandwiches! They pack on the ingredients and have a huge variety. I'm determined to try them all because I haven't found one I don't like."}
{"text":"This place never fails. Have been here about 5 times and each time it gets better. Definitely recommend if you happen to be anywhere on that side of town."}
