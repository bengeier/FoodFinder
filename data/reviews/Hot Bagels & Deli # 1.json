{"text":"Excited for a Boar's Head deli but not super impressed yet. Tried twice for breakfast but over priced and just ok. Will try for lunch instead next time.  I have to say their bagels are very good."}
{"text":"We have been here for breakfast twice so far and each time we were impressed by the quality and portion sizes of the bagels and breakfast sandwiches.  I also really like the coffee selection.  The customer service is excellent too. We are definitely planning to go back for lunch sometime because the sandwiches look incredible."}
{"text":"Came in today and tried their Ruben sandwich.. It was delicious ! Nice and clean place, I will def stop by and try more of their goodies"}
{"text":"Bagels were fresh and the breakfast sandwich was very tasty.  It's nice to have a bagel shop close again. I plan a return trip soon."}
{"text":"First time here today. Bought a bagel sandwich and two other sandwiches. This deli uses boar heads meat which is a big plus. They also dont skimp on how much they put on your sandwich. Im not sure if ordering a sandwhich on an untoasted bagel was my issue...so I need to go back to be for sure. I felt the bagel is harder than Im use to... but it does have a soft interior. Ordered a jalepeno bagel; however there was not a whole lot of jalepeno flavor to it. I enjoy more of a soft chewier bagel...this is more of a hard outside...softer inside. Atleast it is untoasted. Overall, I liked my bagel sandwich.....and will most likely be back for maybe breakfast. Service was friendly with avg wait time."}
{"text":"I am so happy your in Litchfield Park we don't have to drive to Bell road any more. Service and great food here. The bagels have. Great taste to them. The potatoes are awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered rainbow bagels and cream cheese for my daughter unicorn themed bday and there were a hit with the kids and the adults! Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and was okay, but customer service wasn't the best felt rushed and wasn't busy. Had the breakfast special and again was okay...cream cheese for bagel taste like paste...nice to have new business in area though...deli suppose to be really good."}
{"text":"Great food! Bagels are fresh, food is quality! The staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean. I had the Philly and it was delicious, my son had a bagel and they aren't skimpy on the cream cheese. Can't wait to come back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Love their homemade bagels! their sandwiches are great also... The Reuben is our favorite!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast bagels! Ate here for the first time. Nothing better than a local neighborhood spot. The lunch looks good as well. Going to try it next time."}
{"text":"Came here for the Ruben Sandwich and pretzel dog. Both were fresh and delish and prices are reasonable!  Will come back."}
{"text":"Good bagels just like back East. Very expensive though and wish they had round rolls for sandwiches."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying this place is very expensive. Thought I could pick up a quick cheap breakfast down the street but spent over $20 for 2 bagels, some eggs and awful potatoes and coffee. I could see that the potatoes were all already cooked and sitting in a huge pile in the back when I was ordering. I honestly didn't even know they were potatoes until I went to eat my breakfast and realized. They were the closest thing to mashed potatoes as breakfast potatoes could get. Mushy, with no flavor. The bagels were hard and not warm at all. The coffee was bitter. The bacon was actually good. Maybe I came on a bad day, I don't know. I specifically came here because I saw all the good reviews."}
{"text":"finally actual bagels in Phoenix. not the things being sold as \"bagels\" most places which are just bread. I had the onion bagels and they were delicious. also they have bialy's and they were awesome as well. good selection of other bagels as well as they make great looking sandwiches with bagels as well. nice and clean nice place to hang get coffee and bagels. nice seating inside and out. also good deal today is was buy 12 got 6 free! $9.98!"}
{"text":"The food was extremely bland. Also out of all 5 of their coffees but weren't brewing any at all."}
{"text":"Best bagel I have ever eaten in Arizona! I wish this location was by my house. Their bagels are much more fresh and flavorful than the bagel shop by my house. If you want authentic fresh bagels, this is the spot."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast! The guys at work saw my bagel and left to go get some! It is a favorite breakfast place! Prices are very reasonable! They do offer a breakfast special of $5.50 and will give a 10% military discount as well!   You can not beat the quality and price for this place! It is a mom and pop shop (my personal favorite). They have a great selection of homemade bagels!   Stop by and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Their bagels are tasty...but this spot owns the Best Breakfast in the West Valley title...hands down. I'm all about this place for breakfast. Bacon and eggs it's a simple breakfast done with a homemade flare. The Chorizo burrito Delicious! It's the potatoes, they have that homemade taste, it's like my grandma made them in the back."}
{"text":"I love all Hot Bagel and was very excited to learn this one was going in so close to my house.  Everything has been on point and their breakfast burritos are AMAZING; however, the breakfast bagel sandwich is lacking egg.  The bagel is too thick for the small portion of egg provided and they need to basically double it.  I have not had this issue at any other location so hopefully they will make the necessary adjustments soon.  Great friendly family run place to eat!"}
{"text":"This was just an weird experience? On my way to see the doctors. Decided to stop somewhere to grab something easy like a breakfast sandwich. Didn't want to take the time and sit down and have a breakfast plate. So, I seen a sign from the street saying bagels. Great I thought. Get me a egg and bagel sandwich. When I pulled up, right there in front of me was a sign from the window saying breakfast #1 Bagel with egg and meat of your choice sandwich. I go in, meet by the cashier and asked what I would like to have. I asked for the #1, she asked me how I would like to have my eggs. I said over easy. Few minutes past she said my breakfast was ready I walked up and expected my sandwich would be in a bag so I can make a simple grab and dash to my doctors. There stood a plate of potatoes, sausage, and eggs! Just what I didn't want! So I said, this is not what I wanted. I wanted the #1 shown in the window. While she was replying to me, and actually I wasn't even listening to her since the plate of food looked very good. I interrupted her and said don't worry, I'll eat it. Well, The breakfast was fantastic! The home potatoes where amazing. Cooked with enough crispiness and seasoning were perfect. Sausage patty was also very good. Eggs were cooked exactly the way I liked it. The only thing that could have been better was the toast. But no big deal. So sometimes the best thing to do is just go with the flow and see what happens."}
{"text":"Bagelry  I'm a native New Yorker, now living in Arizona.  I grew up starting my day with a roll & butter or my favorite a bagel with butter. I know what you're thinking, the same thought I had, simple find a great bagel shop in Arizona and start your day right.   Finding a ordinary bagel is easy, regardless of where you live. Finding a great bagel that's boiled, baked and given a generous schmear of  butter or cream cheese is tough in these parts, that is until I found Hot Bagels and Deli.   The bagels at Hot Bagels abd Deli are deliciously fresh.  My favorites are the Onion, Garlic, or Salt. These bagel are everything a bagel should be.  The bagel's are crispy, chewy, garlicky, onion-y, salty perfection.  On my next I plan on trying a sandwich. Especially, after I found out that Hot Bagels and Deli use Boars Head Cold Cuts.  If you're ever in the area and want to taste  delicious bagels, and expeirebce great customer service, stop in.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delish! So excited a family owned small business opened up near me. The sandwiches are huge, filling and delicious. The staff is great, I had the Reuben and it was amazing. Haven't tried the bagels yet. Hoping they may add smoothies to their menu as those would blow up in this neighborhood, the only decent smoothie places have such issues with staffing, that I refuse to go. Wishing this business the best!"}
{"text":"I would come here normally you could call me a regular customer, they were always so nice and quick when it came to the food but recently they had made my food incorrectly. I was very upset so I went back and I did not even want a replacement of the food I just wanted a refund and to continue on with my day. The owner did not like that at all, its the Russian lady with short dark hair, as soon as I came back to explain to her that I wanted a refund she began getting mad (something I was very dumbfounded about) and she began arguing with me, mind you I am a young black women so of course I could tell she had no respect for me. She threw the money at me LITERALLY! Told me to never come back. I would not come back in a million years trust me. All very rude people when they made a mistake on their hand. Very horrible place. I would give this zero stars."}
{"text":"I love all of their bagel choices! Family owned! The rainbow bagels are so much fun! My favorite is the everything bagel with jalapeño cream cheese!!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite bagel place in town. Their bagels are delicious and they have a great selection of flavored cream cheese. Great and quick service as well. We go here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Their breakfast sandwiches are pretty good. The bagels themselves are big with lots of \"bread\". I was a bit disappointed in their blueberry bagels, lavender in color and not one blueberry throughout the WHOLE bagel."}
{"text":"Friendly. Speedy. Reasonably priced. Tasted fresh & homemade.  A little too generous with the cream cheese for my taste, but others will probably like it."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted Bagels so we found this shop and OH.MY.GOSH this place was outstanding! The guy at the cash register was so nice, don't know his name. Younger gentlemen, but very nice and very patient! I'm normally very indecisive and since everything looked so god I had a hard time picking! We will be back 100%"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches here. We had the Rueben and the ultimate and both were hot and delicious."}
{"text":"Bagel was good , not the best I've had . The breakfast sandwich needed another egg on it, the amount of egg was paper thin."}
{"text":"Unreal bagels with \"fresh\" cream cheese just like NY! Bagels were excellent and you know your in a good place with Rye, everything, salt and pumpernickel bagels on the  menu. I'll be back Picked up the Ruben for lunch for the men. They loved it!!   Front counter guy was great. This is what your having and here you go. You even get the NY treatment. The best.  (If you are a NY you'll appreciate the quick to the point service)  If I had one more stomach they have fresh crumb cake and black and white cookies too."}
{"text":"Been here twice for a breakfast bagel...delicious! Bagels are fresh and just like you get back east. Love that they serve Boar's Head meats. Can't wait to try lunch!"}
{"text":"Not good.  I ordered a sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich.  The service was fast, but the bagel was tough and unappetizing.   I had heard good things, but unfortunately was not impressed with the quality of their food.  Don't waste your time.  McDonald's is better."}
{"text":"Quality food!  We had a large breakfast order and it was completed efficiently and quickly!  Everyone loved their dishes, from eggs to pumpernickel to Reubens!Great job!"}
{"text":"We just found this little gem.   We can't wait to Come back again and try different sandwiches.   The bagels are soft and fresh.   I had the Ruben and my husband had a roast beef in a bagel with the roast beef heated."}
{"text":"Very delicious burritos. All fresh ingredients and made in front of you. Popular spot. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Grabbed an everything bagel with sausage for breakfast to give this place a try. Thought the food was good. Nothing amazing to rave about but def a good option when other options nearby are fast food chains. I do suggest to others to try them out. Would like to come back and try their lunch at another time."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great bagels, great service.... finally a non chain authentic neighborhood eatery that we can enjoy. All this food was only $5.50!! Move over village Inn there's a new eatery in town. This is our chance to support small family owned  business and help our local economy. Do your part and support your community."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burrito and nice atmosphere with a great staff providing free WiFi. I'm not typically a big bagels fan but I really liked this place."}
