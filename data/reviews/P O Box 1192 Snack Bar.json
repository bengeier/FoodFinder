{"text":"An average of two stars. Three stars is for the decor and music and one for food.  This spot occupies the old rock lobster on queen. When you step in you hear amazing old school hip hop (biggie, foxy brown) and the place is dimly lit with that whole rustic wood thing going on. We went around 7 and the place was fairly empty but picked up around 8.  The menu - $5 snack,$10 mains so very affordable. We ordered the Mac n cheese balls, jerk nachos, pizza fries, and the trio of sliders. For drinks we got some and beer (not a huge selection of each).  The server was great! Attentive without being over bearing. When they ran out of the wine I was having, he brought over another and checked back to make sure I liked it.  The food was not good. So promising but everything could have been made by a home cook. The Mac n cheese balls were good - two large balls on a bed of marinara. The jerk nachos are homemade tortilla chips with a bunch of toppings thrown on top. Very, very spicy. Just meh. The pizza fries were ridiculously salty and that was the only flavor. The sliders are each dressed differently and seasonally and served on onion buns. One was fine, the second was lightly burned, and the third was charred.   The bill was less than $60 for two people so very affordable. Too bad it was just not good.  I would only come back here for music - but most likely I'd make a playlist at home and cook my own burned burgers. Plus no one else would look at me weird as I jammed to some foxy brown in my seat."}
{"text":"Seems like the building itself has been cursed in some way since the Curzon closed. There was some lobster related establishment before 1192 and now apparently 1192 itself closed.  No matter. It can be a past-tense review, strictly speaking if that's actually what's happened.  The few times I went, it seemed to be a decent enough place. Usually attracted enough people on Saturdays. Thursdays was more of a hit-and-miss deal, but it's not like I really went too many times to know all that much as it is.  From what I could tell, good-looking waitstaff who appeared to like working there, which always is a good thing. Clientele pretty good looking for the most part.   The big issues to my mind were how the drinks ended up going into the higher price range compared to a number of other places in the vicinity. As a student, you don't want to put down 7$ for a beer at the least. Mixed drinks alright.   Also, you couldn't really expect to meet people in the sense of actually talking to them unless you wanted to scream in their ears in most cases. The music was really something the few Saturdays that I went.   Eh. All in all, it's a shame that it's apparently closed now. I'd have like to have gone back to a greater degree so I could get a better scope of the place."}
{"text":"The vibe and music were great. They had a DJ spinning old school hip hop/r&b. I've been here twice and while the drinks are decent, the menu is tiny and the food is pretty bland.   I would come here again for drinks to hang out with friends, but definitely not for dinner!"}
{"text":"It's got a good atmosphere with good guys working there. There are some interesting items on the menu but unfortunately now they're overpriced.  Initially they were charging $5 and $10 for the snack/sharing sized items and at that price I feel you could justify the quality. The food is tasty but it's not perfectly executed and should be priced as pub fare. Prices have increased since they opened to $7 and $14 and the food doesn't warrant that as most of the $14 size items aren't large enough for a meal.  The nachos are really spicy. I had no problem with them so they're not crazy if you like heat, but they'd be too hot for a lot of people.  I wouldn't order food there again but would stop in for a drink. They're generous with pours and have some good beers on tap."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place this weekend, saw something about pizza fries on blogTO that peak our curiosity.    The place itself has a great vibe, they were playing a good mix of classic hip hop and there were a good amount of TVs with hockey on.  Wasn't really impressed with the beer selection, with Goose Island being the only really non mainstream offering.  To start, we ordered the mac and cheers balls and the snack size nachos.  The mac and cheese balls weren't too bad, but I wasn't a fan of nachos, they were a bit too much on the spicey side.  We then sampled the slider trio and the pizza fries, the sliders tasted a bit burnt, and the pizza fries, while looking incredibly delicious, were a bit too salty for my liking, it took away from the over all enjoyment of the dish.  This being said, the service was fantastic, our server was on point, friendly, and had the right balance of giving you space and checking in at the right time.  We arrived just before 7, got a table right away, but by 8, the place got busy and had a great vibe.  Two starters, two mains, and 4 drinks came out to $60."}
