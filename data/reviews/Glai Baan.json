{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai Place in town. Ordered the mussels, pad Thai and ribs today. Food came out quickly and wait staff was very attentive and the bartender Max was awesome! What set Glai Bann apart from the completion was the powerful explosion of flavors in the dishes. It's very authentic and the taste was something I haven't experienced before. Very cutest outdoor patio as well."}
{"text":"Not your typical American take-out Thai - be prepared to be transported to the streets of Bangkok when you step foot into this restaurant! I was in town visiting a friend, and we went to this place on a whim - had such an incredible experience! The ambiance, decor, and street food flavors were absolutely spot-on. We shared Singha beers, pork skewers, som tam (papaya salad) with crispy pork belly, pad thai, and pad kee mao - every dish was lovingly prepared and authentic. I don't usually feel compelled to write Yelp reviews, but this place deserves to be highly rated - and I hope that it is still around when I visit Phoenix next time!"}
{"text":"Our first time at this neighborhood place did not disappoint. We sat at the bar where we enjoyed conversation with bartender Maxwell. This boozy Thai tea was so yummy and this entree was great for sharing! A welcomed addition to neighborhood."}
{"text":"Wow - a little Thailand downtown!  Very authentic food, and great Thai-inspired cocktails.   Service was great, and we really enjoyed the outdoor patio.  Max at the bar knows his stuff, and has some really interesting cocktails.  Go check em out!!"}
{"text":"WOW!! From the food to the service to the decor this place is a TEN!! We had the pad Thai, steak salad and a specialty Thai dish and they were all incredible. Best Thai food I've ever had in the States. The friendly staff was very attentive and helpful in suggesting our delicisous dishes. The decor is adorable! There are pictures of the owners family from Thailand, great mood lighting, cozy patio and vintage furniture which give this restaurant a great vibe. I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Great first experience here. Sat outside on a beautiful night. The cocktails were inventive and outstanding (laab flavored!?). The plates to share allowed us to explore quite a few items. The eggs were worth trying and the grilled chicken seemed fresh and flavorful. A bit spendier than most Thai due to the small plates approach but overall an enjoyable night."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. On request my friend received an individual dish by the cook. Back any day"}
{"text":"Spent a lot of time in Thailand and this place is legit. Beautiful authentic Thai. Thanks for giving Phoenix your vision. Drinks are great here too."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely the most amazing thai food you are gonna get in the valley.  Northeastern thai is a flavor bomb and will amaze you. I am thai and i can't speak more highly of this place."}
{"text":"I've been to Glai Baan twice now and have been rewarded with very flavorful and authentic Thai street food.  I spent 2 weeks in Thailand and can confirm that it is like eating on the streets of Bangkok.  Their pad thai and noodle soup were both on point.  Maxwell, their bartender, makes a mean cocktail as well, try the Disappearing Door made with a local rum!"}
{"text":"This is such an amazing, friendly, and delicious new place. By far the most friendly and service oriented staff. Dan and his wife (owners) have one bad ass restaurant and you should check them out ASAP"}
{"text":"Yum. Yum yum yum yum yum yum yum.  Everything is good about this place. Food- check, authentic- check, cocktails- check check. ambience- super check. Cozy- check, unpretentious- check. Friendly- check. Service- check.   This is not Americanized/phx boring thai. me love you long time Glai Baan. Come as you are. Come with twinkles and stars. It is special place, a little gem ."}
{"text":"I was here probably 5 years ago and forgot about the place since I lived so far. Now that I've been reintroduced- holy crap this place/food/service is phenomenal!!!   The pork stick tasted just like what grandma made me when I was growing up in Thailand. So delish!   Ordered the panang, soup, pork stick & som tum- all too tasty cause I over ate. Can't wait to be back"}
{"text":"This was a place were there was great food and great service.but the food was a little to salty and the dessert was very good."}
{"text":"The pork belly pad thai was pretty good, a little too sweet with tamarind (or something) and simultaneously lomein-esque. The pork belly was overcooked and flavorless. I believe that there are some really great items on the menu. As I looked at other tables, I saw lots of things I would like to try, but I just picked something that wasn't my favorite. I look forward to coming back and trying other dishes."}
{"text":"Quaint atmosphere with outdoor seating and friendly service. I Ike that it's open until 11pm for us night owls. I went on a Tuesday night around 8:30pm and the place was packed!   My favorite was the mussels with a curry sauce with a lemongrass-like tang. The mackerel fries rice was good, and came with a sliced hard boiled egg, and side of spicy fish sauce (I think). It took the peppers out of the sauce and mixed it in with the rice and it wasn't too spicy. I would have liked this dish more if it had more greenery like fresh basil or some type of veggie (diced Chinese broccoli. The pork belly with Chinese broccoli was good but didn't wow me. It had lots of Chinese broccoli, and the pork wasn't overly fatty. The pork is similar to Chinese BBQ pork.  I like the food well enough, and I plan on trying other dishes next time!"}
{"text":"Cutest little place with a nice patio. Excellent Thai food. It is a different menu than most would expect, but every dish delivered great flavor. You have to ask for spicy and mean it. I hope they don't resort to adding sugar to everything to accommodate those who don't understand the Thai quartet of flavor-hot, sour, salty,sweet."}
{"text":"Amazing, simply amazing.  Got the mackerel fried rice and dumplings and they were to die for!!!  I'll be back to try everything else"}
{"text":"Great food in an intimate, private space.  Glass noodles with ginger, garlic, and shrimp came together perfectly."}
{"text":"So freaking good and fun and delicious. If you need a Thai fix with friends al fresco or at the bar with Max, you will enjoy your visit to Glai Baan! My recommendation is to try everything - yet to go wrong from Mackerel fried rice to excellent pork and vegetarian dishes yum....."}
{"text":"I've been to Thailand twice and have traveled extensively around the world. This is one of very very few truly authentic Thai restaurants outside of Thailand. Simple, authentic flavors. Wonderful staff. To overlook this place would be unfortunate. Please make time to visit Glai Baan."}
{"text":"Great little Thai spot to check out.  I loved the pork dumplings so much I ordered them twice! The interior of the place is nicely done while still retaining a casual vibe. So many nice details on the dishes and the decor. Come check this place out."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Service was top notch. Food was amazing. Got the Pad Kee Mao and the Dumplings.  Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"After all of the talk, I couldn't wait. Thought it was going to be amazing. Just ok in my opinion."}
{"text":"Totally worth the take on taste.  I found this gem through networking places to eat with friends and work or I probably wouldn't have found it.  Small and not hard to find off 23rd st and Osborne if You don't know where to look you may pass by once twice maybe. I don't find any fault in that I just wasn't sure where to look and it was all just spur of the moment.   The tastes are intense and the portions although not extravagantly huge are appetizing and filling enough... especially if you have friends go with and you all share each other's course.  So let's see... there is a host and the service isn't bad. Although they do get busy enough as any good restaurant where you may want to flag down a server for more water but that's about it. No pushing  you through your meal... they are great at describing the item you may interested in when asked about it.  Parking lot is decent size and fills up but the store next door is empty/ as in closed down and moved  and I use that lot as do others  If you want a great take on Thai food that has tastes unlike any I've had here in Phoenix I recommend here."}
{"text":"We came here for a friend's birthday at the end of April. It was just cool enough to sit outside without bring too warm. We started with almost one of each of the appetizers. All were so good! We ordered one of each of the pail drinks. The coconut one was better IMO. Every one enjoyed they food and beverages. I highly recommend the drink with the fish sauce! Don't be scared! It's lovely!"}
{"text":"Menu is simple and different. Each dish is full of very developed flavors. I live 30 minutes from here but it's our favorite Thai spot. My son loves the wings and dumplings. He's addicted to this place. Curry is an absolute must. The place is quaint, vibrant and alive. The staff...they're kind. The word is out which means the place may be packed on any given night so patience is a virtue especially if you want to get a taste of this unique place."}
{"text":"This street style fair was most excellent!!! The bartender was very knowledgeable on their selection of wines however the waitress did not know yet she's was very helpful and pleasant ."}
{"text":"Great new spot in the hood! If you can, sit at the bar and let Maxwell take great care of you. Skip the menu and just take his recommendations. This place feels cozy and hip without trying too hard. The pork dumplings were my favorite. Mango sticky rice was delightful."}
{"text":"Wow, they got us in last Tuesday night and recommended all of our dishes.  Great place, nice people, fantastic food."}
{"text":"Loud, cramped, crowded, hip, overpriced, dark, trendy. Very limited menu with small, overpriced portions. The special appetizer was great but tiny and overpriced. Both entrees were excessively noodle-y, one extremely bland and gummy, the other tasty but mostly noodles and curry. Very few vegetables in either entree. Limited drink selections. Nearly $50 plus tip for two entrees and one appetizer, no drinks. I woke up very hungry the next morning."}
{"text":"service was a bit uneven but the food was very good.  Nice outdoor seating.Will return."}
{"text":"Some interesting and different dishes. Love the son in law eggs, a kind of soft boiled and lightly fried egg in scrumptious sauce. Little plates is the theme. So we had tasty and non-spicy dumplings, savory pork skewers and spicy pad ki mao. Tried the bread dessert too.  It is Hawaiian bread/ cake like fish with a surprisingly green custard with a light mint flavor."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! My boyfriend and I split the wings, steamed dumplings, Khao Soi, and panang curry. Everything was delicious and had excellent flavor. I also had the Thai iced tea with rum and highly suggest it. Great service and great food. I have already suggest Glai Baan to my friends."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food and service were outstanding. Our server did a wonderful job explaining the menu with patience. The dumplings!!! When we walked in, the hostess was being berated by a small man who had a long wait. FYI... if you don't want to wait, make a reservation. I can't wait to go back:)"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant I have ever been to, and I have eaten Thai in almost ever major city in the US. My friend who travels to Thailand all the time came with me and said it was better then anything she had ever had in Thailand. The best restaurant in AZ, Thai or not."}
{"text":"So delicious! First of all, they have Kao soi which I love and isn't always easy to find. We had a whole fish special that was amazing (fingers crosses it makes it onto the menu). The place is very cute, nice ambience. Great service, I don't think I've ever had my water glass refilled so many times. Basically it's my new favorite Thai place. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Glai Baan is our favorite Thai spot in Phoenix! Every single dish is so delicious! The dumplings are amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Every dish we tried was delicious. We sat on patio. Nice selection of cocktails. Dumplings and papaya salad is so good. Noodles were great also. Waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful when picking items to try. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been wrestling for awhile as to whether or not I should review this place. My experience with Thai cuisine stems as far as ordering Pad Thai from Thai Express up the street from my apartment, so I keep telling myself that maybe my taste buds weren't built to handle traditional Asian cuisine. I mean, I'm half-Filipino, but that doesn't mean I know how to appreciate all other types of Asian delicacies. I finally decided to go through with this review, and I shall paint the picture for you.  I was visiting my friend who had recently moved out west from Columbus. This friend is even more well traveled than me, and spent six months in Thailand. He had heard of Glai Baan from various magazines and tv reports, and was overly intrigued by the thought of authentic Thai food. After all, he had spent most of college in Cincinnati experiencing the same Thai Express that I'm accustomed to, and Cbus doesn't exactly fit the bill for real deal Thai food either. All of this backstory is basically me explaining how pumped he was to try Glai, and how it ultimately let him down.  We ventured in on a Wednesday evening to find the restaurant pretty packed. Luckily, we were able to score a spot on their cute side patio. It was well lit and heated so it was the perfect dining spot. We both opted for beer (I am a fervent beer drinker, and my friend has some weird obsession with Thai beer.) Surprisingly, they had a nice mix of crafts from the west coast, so we were both happy with our drink selection.  I was leaning toward ordering the pad Thai because I'm basic/unfamiliar with Thai food, but the server steered me toward the green curry. My companion was super pumped because he could order kao soi, which is essentially Thailand's chicken noodle soup. Our food arrived, and we were taken aback by how pretty our plates looked. They were expertly put together and could have been an awesome addition to the 'gram. However, the consensus between our two dishes was that it was good, but we felt like there has to be better out there. For as pretty as my dish was, the toppings/noodle/broth ratio didn't feel very balanced, and I found many bites to be missing something. As for the kao soi, my friend liked it but noted that it didn't have the kick he found in many kao sois across Thailand. He added a lot of chilies; I thought it was cute that they had a little table side array of chilies available for her food. After all, I do enjoy the spice.  I would try here again if asked, simply because part of me feels like the dishes that were ordered on my trip weren't my cup of tea. I do love some pad Thai, and the pad kee moo sounds like something I could get behind. If I ever come back, I just hope the flavors are kicked up a notch."}
{"text":"This place just opened around the corner from my house, so naturally I was excited to try it. Ordered pad Thai and crab fried rice to go. Was asked on the phone my spice level and ordered as mild as possible. Food was pretty pricy and portions VERY small. A hungry man would need to order two entrees to be satisfied. The flavor was good and food was enjoyable, however it was SO spicy. The food was visibly coated in lots of red pepper flakes. My lips haven't stopped burning and my nose was running the whole time. Having ordered mild, it was so spicy it wasn't enjoyable after a few bites...which is good because you only get a few bites. 2 stars solely for flavor. Bigger portions or more reasonable prices and accuracy of \"mild\" would make this review a 5."}
{"text":"Deliciousness all around, super cute for a date night! Drinks, food, ambiance, service, all day of it is excellent :) P.S. you HAVE to have the Son in law eggs, you're welcome!"}
{"text":"So my third time here. Beautiful night, sat outside. We had the Nua num tok, New York strip salad reminiscent of a larb. It was delicious with the toasted crispy rice!!! Yum. Then we had the kapro gai kai dao, stir fried mince chicken and rice. Soooooo really delicious. Our wine and cocktails enhanced the dinner. I won't even tell you about how good the mango and sticky rice was!! You'll have to come and taste for yourself. Another fantastic meal!!! Thank you Glai Baan!!!"}
{"text":"I didnt know what to expect but went on a thursday night with four friends and service and food were great, served in very reasonable time and nice cozy ambiance and lighting all around. We even felt like we werent in Phoenix, and more in a small house with bushes and trees around. I have absolutely no complaints."}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH!! This place was AMAZING! If you like Thai food, then look no further than this restaurant.   The service was unbelievable. From the moment we walked in, to when we left everyone was very friendly and attentive.  We had the pork dumplings, which you MUST have!! We also tried the PadThai, which was the best I've ever had.   Lastly, we had the Mango sticky rice. One of the best desserts I've had in a long time. 10/10 recommend.   Our waiter, Geraldo, was fantastic. He gave great recommendations and was on it.   Thank you to the amazing staff, we cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Convenient location and open till midnight. Menu wasn't too extensive  but had good selections. We ordered the Red curry brisket special which was great! The pad Thai however was a bit on the bland side for my taste. We had to add a lot of spice to give it that extra flavor. Overall a good atmosphere and a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. Amazing meal. Requested vegan option. Drunken noodles to die for. Great staff. Owner came out a few times to say hello and check in."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a recommendation from one of our fav bartenders. It's so good! We sampled at least half the small plates. All were wonderful! And the cocktails were delicious. Unique twists on some old classics. And the service was great too. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Been there thaid that. Glai Baan is a hidden gem located in the inner city of Phx. I have never been to Thailand but I felt like I was there. The building itself was very cool and Thai land like. Ordered a delicious noodle plate. Hit the spot but could have eaten more. Highly recommended. Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Nice patio, this place smells delicious. Service very nice, presentation nice and food delicious will definitely be back. Mussels turned my (friends) crank."}
{"text":"Glai Baan has been getting a lot of hype lately and I really wanted to try it in hopes that the publicity has been warranted. The verdict is that it has been! First off the ambiance is very cozy, tastefully decorated, the dining area and bar are quite quaint and has a welcoming vibe. We started off at the bar since there was a wait for a table and had a hard time deciding which cocktail to try as they all sounded very interesting. I went with the Laab Sided which was a liquid cocktail version of laab and my husband had the Anywhere Door which was an alcoholic version of a Thai tea. How the bartender was able to get the flavors of laab into liquid form was very intriguing to me and I had to pick his brain on the recipe. He enthusiastically spoke to me about the process of inventing this sweet yet savory drink which is a must try.  Our table was ready, the menu had a lot of fantastic looking dishes. We of course had to try the Khao soi as it was my favorite dish that I had in Chiang Mai and is also one that I learned to cook at a cooking class there. Our server helped us with the rest of our choices, the pork dumplings and the special of mackerel fried rice. The dumplings were wonderful, you could tell how fresh they were. The Khao soi met my expectations, and tasted spot on with the ones that I had eaten in Thailand and the mackerel fried rice was to die for. Portion sizes were large and we were full about 3/4's of the way through, but it was one of those meals you couldn't let go to waste so we licked our plates clean even though we were stuffed!   Service was warm and welcoming from the front of the house, to the bartender and our waitress. All were very knowledgeable and willing to describe the dishes/cocktails to help make choices. Overall it was a well rounded fantastic experience, one of those places you will just want to eat your way through the menu. The hype is definitely deserved!"}
{"text":"Glai Baan, I love you. Can I just say that? Is it too soon? I know we've only met once, but when you know, you know. You know?   You get me. You excite me. You are my new favorite hang. And you really hit the spot (know what I'm saying). You bring me such joy. I want nothing but success for you. Just not too much success, because I get jealous easily. No matter how popular you get, I want us to stay the same. I always wanna be your regular, baby. I wanna slip in for nightcaps. I wanna explore all the offerings on your menu. I wanna put your dumplings in my mouth.   Ok, I'm done.  Just go, but remember I was here first and you never forget your first.   (Ok, I might not have been first, but I was the best.)"}
{"text":"This has became my favorite Thai restaurant ever. A beautiful place, perfect ambiance and exceptional service. Food was great and perfectly portioned. Flavors were amazing and not overwhelming. Spiciness in médium was perfect. I usually add spices to my food, I enjoyed the dishes as they came. The special red curry with beef was delicious, a bit on the sweet side if you like that. And the noodles had enough flavor mixed with the beef that was cooked to perfection and which was a good cut of beef. Overall one of the best experiences of Thai food I had in Phoenix. The patio is just beautiful and November is perfect time to enjoy outdoors. If it gets cold, there are space heaters? :)"}
{"text":"When I heard my favorite northern Thai dish (khao soi) was on the menu, I did a little dance. I went with high expectations, and Glai Baan's did not disappoint. The flavor was just like I remembered, and I was full enough to take home leftovers. I wasn't sure about the pickles, but they were a nice compliment.   The restaurant's ambiance was pleasant and perfect for a date night. I went on a Saturday at 7pm, and for a group of two, we had about a 10 min wait. Call ahead if bringing a large group as the space is limited (in fact my chair was bumped several times by people trying to get thru.)   I'll be back soon to explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"What a rare find in Phoenix! The dumplings were super delish! The pad kee mao was really authentic!  We sat outdoors and enjoyed our evening here so much. I highly recommend this place. There are very few places like this in Phoenix. I hope they stay consistent!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS! I finally made it in to Glai Baan and am SO happy that I did. First, the ambiance is so cozy, hip, and romantic. It does get busy on weekends so I recommend calling ahead if you have a large party! It makes the perfect date night spot or good for small groups of 4-6. The cocktails are truly unique, whipped up by a FABULOUS and well-known Valley mixologist (Hi Maxwell!). He made me the yummiest Thai Tea Mocktail that came in the cutest cup, with an adorable straw, and umbrella. Yes, please. I loved it. For all the mommas out there, have him make this for you!   For appetizers, our group of 5 people shared 3 orders (yes, THREE, they're that good) of their dumplings, one order of their fried rice with chicken, papaya salad, and their wings. Oh my goodness, everything was so flavorful but the dumplings are definitely some of the best that i've ever had.   For my entree, I ordered the Kao Soi. Think Thai Curry in a soup version with rice noodles, chicken, cilantro, herbs, etc. OH MY GOSH, obsessed. It was a HUGE portion as well. You better believe i'll be coming here on the regular during the wintertime to get a bowl of this comforting goodness. It is literally soup for the soul.  If you love Thai food, this will be your new favorite place in town. It really doesn't compare to any other Thai food that i've had in the Valley, or ever. Possibly because their menu consists of \"street\" Thai dishes but honestly, it is dreamy. You can thank me later. ;) We'll be back again soon, for sure!  P.S. Sorry for the lack of foodie photos! It was a tad dark and I just didn't feel that my photos did the food justice so I kept it a surprise! ;)"}
{"text":"So excited to try last night! Everything just great and the dumplings to die for! Seriously - we ordered a second order and still craving more today. We'll be back a lot I'm sure!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here last week and were extremely happy with the service, food and ambiance.   One of the best Thai restaurants in town.  We highly recommend the dumplings, pork skewers, Pad Lee Mao and Kai Soi.   All very flavorful and great portion sizes.  Sit at their bar before dinner and have some of their great cocktails.  We highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Glai Baan is a beautiful, authentic Thai restaurant that is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. For starters, we order the chicken wings. It is perfectly crispy and pairs well with the amazing dipping sauce. I eat this spicy, delicious dipping sauce with everything including the crab fried rice. There is adequate amount of crab in this dish. Some people might find this dish bland but I think it's perfectly and adequately seasoned. I have tried their pad thai and panang curry and they are both very delicious.   Over all, Glai Baan has impressed us tremendously, from the authenticity, the service and the general vibe of the restaurant. Give this place a try, it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I think I was here on an off night. My friend and I went tonight on Thursday. They were bustling but seated us immediately with water and a drink order. Then seemed to forget one friends drink after several reminders we got it at the back third of the meal. We also had to ask for plates and a few other things multiple times as they seemed to be forgotten.  The food was delicious, the dumplings are delicious the larb was tasty. I didn't not enjoy the crab salad. Mostly bc it seemed like there was no crab flavor and only hard shell crab which was occasionally smaller than other pieces of the papaya salad and were almost eaten or swallowed.   If I come back I'll likely order takeout."}
{"text":"This place is it! This place is legit! Super good amazing customer service. trendy spot!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were fantastic! It's open seating at the bar and the bartender is amazing!! Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a dinner a few weeks ago and arrived right at opening time in order to snag a table without a wait.  The restaurant is cozy and comfortable, the staff is friendly and the food is quite good.  We shared the pork dumplings and I had the pad kee mao with pork for my entree.  Quite good and a nice addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  There were three empty tables each to seat 4 people.  As we were just 2 they declined to seat us. So we left and as there are so many restaurant choices in Phoenix we won't bother to go back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed first (and last) time here.  Very nice decor and ambiance, but it is overpriced, overly small portions, and the food is nothing special.  I love Thai food and have spent time in Thailand, and this just did not measure up. I ordered the green curry, and it did not look like the picture of it posted here  as there was almost no sauce-very unusual for a curry.  Very small portion.  I had that and water to drink. My friend had a small plate and a tea.   Our tab was around $40 with tip and we left there still hungry.   Ridiculous in my opinion.  I will be sticking to my favorite Thai restaurant on Central that not only serves up value for the money, but outstanding taste, and I never leave there hungry. For the same price we paid at Glai Baan, we would have had a feast- much more and better food- and been much more satisfied.."}
{"text":"Small place, small menu but great food! Sat at the bar and had the friendliest bartender. Looks like it's turning into quite the hotspot as there was a small waiting list when we went on a Wednesday night. We had the curry panang and the beef was very tender. Also had a chicken thigh appetizer w dipping sauces. Sauces were good but not a huge fan of skin on chicken though, so didn't think the appetizer was great. Highly recommend this place though."}
{"text":"Awful.  Have been here before when it wasn't busy.  Came here tonight and they kept seating others before us.  Went to the bar and they said they'd wait on us if we waited in the lobby and they'd bring us menus.  Horribly run.  Don't go here!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that changes and makes a neighborhood. And the kind of place Phoenix needs a lot more of.  The atmosphere and vibe are authentic, creative, eclectic, cozy and all around wonderful. From the serving dishes, cocktail presentations, light fixtures, shelving behind the bar, use of the limited space, etc, everything is thought out and unique to Glai Baan and true to their roots. The staff is attentive, knowledgeable, accommodating and always nearby, but never overbearing.   The cocktails are simple, thoughtful and dangerously good. Enough of a variety, but not too many choices. Again, consistent with their Thai roots, and pair well with the food.   Ohhhh, and they also have food. Super delicious food. We had the dumplings, mussels and panang curry. We had to talk ourselves out of ordering more just so we could keep eating and trying more dishes, despite being stuffed. We literally just almost ordered a second portion of the panang curry as soon as we tasted it because it was so damn good.    We could not have had a better experience. We left euphoric, very full, and frantically texting friends who hadn't been yet telling them to go asap.  Thank you, Glai Baan, for creating such a perfect little neighborhood spot. We'll be back as many times as our bellies and wallets will permit."}
{"text":"Very good! Not the typical Thai. Great addition to the hood. Love that the have Hitachino beer.  Nice touch."}
{"text":"needed some late night grub/takeout and discovered this late night gem . sat in bar and placed a to go order . waiter recommended the  Pad Kee Mao , as i wanted something w noodles in it .easily one of the best Thai dishes i have ever had as well as their delicious thai tea ..only negative i would say is their portion was rather small for the $$ ( not sure if it was because i got it to go) but either way,very filling!  will def be back"}
{"text":"Finally found some authentic Asian food in Phoenix.  This is Thai street food at its best.  We had the pork dumplings which were delicious.  The brother in law eggs are very good and flavorful, some of the dishes have them included. We will be back soon, so good."}
{"text":"Spent a lazy Friday evening here just chilling on the patio, sipping a cocktail, eating Thai tapas. The mussels made my Friday -- the broth was made with coconut milk, lemongrass, and kaffir lime leaves, and was good enough to drink on its own. And they went awesome with the Laab Sided cocktail (had two of those, could've kept going). Dumplings and mackerel fried rice were not bad either. Service was friendly and efficient. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Wow!! Fresh! Tasty! Just like home!!! Krapao!! Khao phat poo!!! Fantastic!!   Drinks menu is a bonus!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and beautiful atmosphere. Everything from the food to the decor to each and every little dumpling seems to be very thought out and done with love and care. The staff is very sweet and accommodating. The owner/chef seems to be loved by her staff and her passion and hard work definitely shows to her customers."}
{"text":"I found the food here disappointingly bland. I ordered the picked crap papaya salad expecting it to be very spicy based on the menu's warning. It was mild to medium at best. And this is a dish that is supposed to be one of the hottest dishes in Thailand. The larb had almost no detectable spice, basically ground meat with some herbs. Some people here have complained about the food being too spicy. I must have gone to a different restaurant, because what I got was the same typical americanized, bland Thai food you get at most places in Phoenix. Maybe I have to try it again and beg the staff that I want to eat real food."}
{"text":"I am yearning to go back to Glai Baan!!!! The food is beyond words! We did some small plates that were all fantastic. The dumplings especially are amazing! All the noodle dishes are so so awesome!!!!! Want to go back and try more."}
{"text":"Wow. I don't write many reviews but you should totally go here. My boyfriend and I came here late at night, and were totally impressed. Great food, amazing service, absolutely lovely experience. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My hubby and I are so happy we came here,great service & amazing food!!!! All around great vibes!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found ourselves in the cutest patio with the nicest people at this new restaurant.  We had the mussels which were SO good, the broth definitely deserve some rice.  Then we had the Kao soi which was super interesting, for sure out of my normal palate which is super appreciated.  It was actually a bit chilly so we enjoyed some very nice hot jasmine tea.  Thinking we were full and ready to leave a gentleman brought out a complimentary dessert of some fantastic sweet bread with a custard.  Overall the service was welcoming and so sweet, I really welcome this new establishment and wish them well with their endeavors.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"The good news is that it's better than all the Thai restaurants I've been to in Phoenix.  I'm from the East Coast and not that I believe we have better Thai restaurants in the East Coast I just haven't found a good one since I've been here... that is until they opened GB around the corner.  I've only been in Phoenix a year and I was back East my entire life, so in all fairness, I've had more time to find good Thai back East.  I ordered the pad Thai.  The flavors were spot on.  The heat was right on.  They are cooking from the heart, for the love of food and the love of cooking.  I order the Pad Kee Mao mostly and it doesn't disappoint.  They have, in the last few months made some adjustments to the \"streety-ness\" of the food, probably due to time and the size of clientele, product availability? It hasn't hurt the integrity of the product.  Please, no more changes.  I've also tried the Son-in-Law eggs.  It was good.  Damn good.  It had an rustic flavor.  I couldn't get away from the fact I was eating an egg in a bowl with rice and when I know what else is on the menu I rather try that."}
{"text":"Nothing better when it comes to Thai!!  Every dish a must try!  Delicious food and a good wine list!  Seriously this is a can't miss if you are in town!"}
{"text":"Loved the food and that it's right down the street from where I live! The cocktails are adorable and very tasty. Took my sister here over Christmas holiday and she was in town from NYC so of course she's surrounded by top notch Asian cuisines. She was impressed too. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I expected this to be a super great place with new flavors that o couldn't find at any place else. Service was slow, and my dish was extremely salty.  There was a scarce amount of severs that seemed to be running into each other. Ordered and appetizer and the people that got to the bar 15 minutes after us got their appetizer first. It was just okay. Nothing is bringing me back."}
{"text":"Wasn't a huge fan... I only ordered the pad thai and thought it was mediocre at best. The portion size was very small for the price. Atmosphere was good."}
{"text":"Very unique spin to Thai food, everything I tried was full of flavor and fresh! Great service at the bar. Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Potstickers were great. Wine selection and advice was great. Pad thai was good, different style than what we're used to. Loved the patio seating, but hostess/servers seemed to be on different pages at times. Good experience overall!"}
{"text":"This place is a great date spot located near 24th St & Osborn. A cute little small quaint Thai restaurant with a great outdoor courtyard. Delicious food with a unique drink menu. Small spot which might mean a little bit of a wait. Best time to go is after 9 pm on the weekend there will be more availability. Worth checking out for-sure!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Glai Baan - amazing food and great service. I just wish they would expand their hours and add some lunch takeout!"}
{"text":"First time in tonight and the soup was unreal! One of the best Thai soups I can remember having. The space is homey and relaxed but the dishes are world class. I am looking forward to returning soon. The bartender Maxwell was very helpful and was totally on point with the drink recommendations. Very impressed on round one."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place on our weekly date night. Everything about this place was amazing. The food, the service and the place were incredible.   The restaurant was very cute and quaint, and has a nice patio.  We had the pork dumplings and Tom Zap to start. Both were very flavorful and delicious. We fell in love with dumplings and if we weren't full we would have ordered more at the end of our meal.   For our main course we had the special (Jungle Curry) and Pad kee mao which is comparable to drunken noodles, again we were amazed. We would have drank the sauce in the jungle curry if it was socially acceptable.  For dessert we had the Kanom Custard, it had pieces of warm bread you dip into the custard it was on point, and an excellent finish to our meal.  The staff/owner/chef were all so friendly and welcoming. The owner/chef (Kat) came out and talked to us and all the other customers in the restaurant, she was very friendly. The bartender Max brought his own unique style to place, he made an amazing drink for me and was fun and friendly.  I will be telling all my friends to go here!"}
{"text":"We saw the review in the local paper and decided to try it out. We just moved back to the states from spending a couple of years in Vietnam and my wife is a Vietnamese food blogger and cookbook author so we've got some appreciation of SE Asian food. We've also spent quite a bit of time in Thailand solely to eat.  First the good: 1. The ambiance of the restaurant is nice and there is a charming outdoor seating area. 2. Someone there really loves Doraemon, the robot cat from the future who is also very popular all over SE Asia but is probably unknown by most in the West. Cute touch. 3. The serving staff is ultra-attentive and kind. I'm giving 4 stars for them, otherwise it would be 3. 4. The flavor of my pork belly dish was really good, with a nice smoky aroma. 5. Back to the servers, they topped my water off religiously. Cheers to them! 6. Nice bathrooms. Clean and well-designed. 7. Good parking and street access  Now the bad: 1. As others have noted we paid more for Pad Thai than I have paid anywhere, including NYC, and the portion size will leave you still hungry at the end. This was true for my 95lb wife who is not a big eater by any means. My meal was similar in size and left me needing something more, although not at the prices this place charges. Either the portions need to increase or the price needs to decrease for this to feel like a reasonable deal.  2. The Pad Thai was just ok, and it included uncooked white scallions, which is a no-no. They should have used cooked chives. It was also missing tamarind sauce and the noodles were undercooked for legit Thai noodles and the vegetables were also undercooked and too hard for Pad Thai. It wasn't terrible but a standard $2 plate of real Pad Thai street food would have been a better standard to base their recipe on.  Also, for Asian tastes it was very over-salted, which is unfortunately the standard for Asian food in Phoenix.  3. There were some interesting-looking small plates on the menu but at a high enough price that I wasn't interested enough to try one out.  4. The restaurant was moderately busy on a Thursday night, most indoor tables filled, but no diners waiting to be seated. We were told that they wouldn't be filling our food order for at least 40 minutes since the kitchen was so slammed. Having worked both front of house and back of house in popular restaurants, I would say this is pretty unacceptable level of performance for their kitchen. This will lose the restaurant money as people decide to leave (as we saw a couple of couples do) instead of wait so long for their food. We had to wait 40-50 minutes for our food. Real Thai food tends to come out quick, fresh and hot so I'm not sure why their cooks aren't up to the task to keep their kitchen humming along.   I think this place has potential, particularly with the great staff and building. Thai street food isn't difficult to prepare, so they just need to make some adjustments to reach the level of deliciousness that you can get on any street or even in the Central World mall food court in Bangkok. They also need to either add kitchen staff or get their staff trained in managing multiple orders at once and get an expediter or someone to help keep things running quicker in the back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is awesome! The servers are very nice and the chef even came out to chat with me and my gf. I ordered the Pad Thai which was phenomenal. The dessert with the bread and green sauce was very interesting. Overall, it feels like you are transported to a little Thai bungalow when you come here. This is one of my new go to Thai restaurants. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to go to this wonderful place. Better yet, my foodie friend joined me also, so we could order to our hearts' content. We ordered Kanom Jeeb (steamed pork dumplings with scallion ginger soy sauce), Silom Road Moo Ping (Pork skewers with garlic Jaew sauce), Son-in-Law Eggs (fried soft-boiled eggs topped with fried shallots served with sweet, salty and sour sauce), Penang Curry (braised beef, roasted pepper, bamboo shoot, and Thai basil) and Pan Fried Glass Noodles with Shrimp and Pork Belly. Everything was delicious! The taste of the Penang Curry reminded me so much of Indonesian's famous dish: Beef Rendang. If Sriracha or dried chili powder are not extra hot enough for you, you can ask for chopped Thai bird chilies. Max, our server was awesome also. Too bad they don't open for lunch. Will definitely want to go back here again and try something else."}
{"text":"One of the best authentic Thai places in the city.  Love the team that operates it.  The space is a delight.  Parking can be a little tight - but very much worth it.  Every time I go I try something new.  Cocktails are refreshing too!  Skip the white washed Thai places in Phoenix and go here for a real experience."}
{"text":"Seriously fantastic. Authentic.  Great atmosphere.  Every dish was perfect. Pork Dumplings, mussels and spicy chicken."}
{"text":"4 star newcomer. Great food, super friendly owner, fun nostalgic Thai pictures from owners on the walls. Good date night spot! The food was exactly what I would envision getting from a yum food truck or street vendor in Thailand! A very different experience from your run of the mill Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Such a quaint little space. Love the flavors... everything taste wonderful and fresh. Such a great Thai restaurant... not your typical Americanized Thai restaurants you'll find around the valley. Where else can you find chicken heart BBQ skewer?!! The salted crab papaya salad is really refreshing! Great wine selection as well. I don't think I've ever been to any Thai restaurant in the metro Phoenix area that has decent wine selection and this place has great selection to pair with your food."}
{"text":"I enjoyed dinner at Glai Baan twice within a week or so, it's that good. I love seeing new and creative restaurants opening in the valley.  Glad Baan offers a unique take on Thai food that's totally new to Phoenix. Their menu is super shareable, and I am obsessed with all of their apps. The fried chicken wings are incredible, and we also loved the mussels. All of their sauces are fresh and packed with flavor.  So far, I've tried the wings, dumplings, mussels, Kao Soi, Pad Thai, and Pad Kee Mao.  Their Pad Thai is amazing. There's no other way to put it. The flavor is so rich, and so fresh. You can tell that every single dish is made with a lot of care and attention. The Kao Soi is like a curry soup that we all really enjoyed. The Pad Kee Mao was a favorite for some of our group, and fell flat for others.  Overall, definitely come here open-minded. If you're vegetarian, ask what they can do - we went the 2nd time with vegetarian friends, and the kitchen had a few specials for them.  Otherwise, try the wings, mussels, and pad thai - to start. Or just order one of everything  Their menu will continuously change, so if you love something, order it while you can!  Also, the staff was great. Dan (the owner) really cares about his patrons, and it shows."}
{"text":"After two visits to Glai Baan, I feel confident saying that I'm a fan!  My first visit was with my husband and kids... we had a pleasant experience, but I didn't rush back right away.  After that meal, I decided that I like traditional Thai food better than the \"street food\" that is served here.   However, when a friend suggested we meet at Glai Baan for dinner on a recent Saturday night, I took her up on her offer as it was time for a revisit.  I'm so glad I did as I liked the food much better than the initial visit.  On both visits, I had the Pad Thai and the Chicken Wings, and on my second visit, we shared an order of Pad Prik with Chicken... all of those things were very good.  It's worth noting that the menu is a bit limited, especially for those who don't eat pork... there is a lot of pork on the menu!  That being said, there is something for most everyone here, including my kids who are pretty picky.  For picky eaters or those that aren't feeling too adventurous, ask for the rice and chicken and you'll be good.   The food is the highlight here but GB also offers a unique drink menu, attentive service,  and a low key casual yet hip ambiance.  I hope this locally owned gem stays around for awhile as it's one I will definitely keep in our rotation!"}
{"text":"Food and ambiance were excellent. The decor is very inviting and loved the outdoor patio. Our favorite was the mackerel fried rice and the crab papaya salad. Their Thai tea was great - not too sweet. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, fantastic food and decor. The drinks are great I would absolutely recommend it if you're looking for a Thai food experience that you can't get anywhere else in the valley."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after work on a Friday, wasn't too crowded.  Had fantastic food! Will definitely go back.  One of the better Thai places in Phoenix that I've been able to find.  Max (bartender) was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Wanting some Thai food with no boundaries? Glai Bann is your off the chart spot! Very quaint spot with an amazing staff that makes you feel like your in Thailand. Maxwell who has been at this location since day 1 is so knowledgeable and very upbeat and pleasant. He guided up through the menu. Starting with the pork dumplings are such a treat that i am still dreaming about them, we followed that with a papaya salad which was interesting but delicious followed by a bowl that was rice, diced chicken and topped with a fried egg this is plenty  for a party of two share.  Make sure to make reservations if you have a party over 2 and make sure to ask questions.  Thank you Maxwell we look forward to seeing you soon and working our way around the menu.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The atmosphere is so nice and the staff was super friendly. My friend was a regular and they all knew her name. The pad Thai, dumplings, and steak skewers were incredible. I wanted to take a box of the dumplings home with me! I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the staff was so friendly! I love Thai food, and this was probably my favorite Thai meal I have had in the southwest. I recommend their cocktails. I ordered the Laab Sided, and it had a really interesting and delicious flavor profile."}
{"text":"Just go. Enjoy. U won't regret it like a tattoo of ur ex on ur lower back.  Authentic street food that will make ur tongue think it's in  Thailand on a soul searching trip with julia Roberts."}
{"text":"This place was a very authentic experience. My girlfriend and her family are Laotian and very hard critics of so called authentic Laos restaurants. This place made me look real good and they sort of trust me and my judgement now lol!!"}
{"text":"Very traditional Thai food. I love setting outside on the patio. I had the green curry last night it was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! So happy to see this restaurant open in the neighborhood. This restaurant is not like everyday Thai places. It's better! The owners are super friendly and you can taste the love in the food. Looking forward to eating here again!!"}
{"text":"I wish I lived in PHX so i can come back to try their drinks and try other dishes!  The vibe here is awesome. I really liked the space and the lighting to make it such a chill but not making me sleepy type of setting.   The food:  We started with the appetizer pork bone soup. Forgot the actual name for it on the menu but this was amazing!! The meat fell off the bone and it was definitely something I would order again. The crab fried rice was delicious. It could use a little more time in the wok but still was good. It came with a side of fish sauce that i definitely used all of it.   I would come back!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING.  The place is super cool and within walking distance of my house.  The bar area is small but it's so cool I could hang out there for a while with good friends, and the outdoor space is really cool too.  I hope Glai Baan is watching these reviews because my only complaint is what others are saying.  Portion sizes are too small for the main dishes.  I am a small person and I'm still hungry after eating my entire entree.  If the portion was bigger and more filling, it would be 5 stars across the board!  Reviews are always update-able though ;)  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"OK, let's start with pork dumplings   You are crazy if you don't. These balls of joy are incredible!  Not gushing with liquid like  so many, just a flavorful pouch with a little crunchiness. Absolutely the best dumplings I have had.   We did the Pad Kee Mao for an entree. Medium spicy wasn't very hot, if you like a little heat, go fo\"spicy \".  Quality of the dish is top notch.   Try this place, you will love it!"}
{"text":"YES! Was here not too long ago, also it's been years since I wrote a Yelp review  this place is one of its only exceptions.  As a person who moved here to Phoenix not too long ago, Since moving here, ive yearned for authentic south East Asian cuisine here in the valley (being from Khmer, Thai, and Chinese decent)   I'm happy to say Glai Baan is doing something right, they're not doing what Phoenix wants. They're feeding Phoenix something they never knew they needed.   From dishes as like Khao soi, Pad kee mao, nam phrik, aren't really found her in Phoenix, possibly due to the major amounts of dumbed down Asian menu's to fit the cities palate.   Glai baan has become a beacon of light for Phoenix's food scene, something I been patiently waiting to see for this city. This place is somewhere I feel like I can invite my friends of any racial decent into my grandmothers home without the feeling of hopefully not chasing them out with the smell of fermented fish hanging in the air. Instead; excited for them to taste the roots of our ancestors without having to change the food.   Thank you Glai baan, you've made me proud and happy to be here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I was pretty sad to see Mejico go - but I am pretty happy Glai Baan is now in its place!!   Came in and grabbed take out.  Love the set up of the restaurant. Everyone working was super friendly and helpful with questions.  Ordered the pad thai with extra veggies - perfect balance of the sweet and spicy (I asked for extra hot) noodles were perfectly cooked and the veggies were fresh and delicious.  Pad Kee Mao (sub'd tofu instead of pork)  also got extra spicy - this was soo freaking good.  Loved all the veggies and the flavor. Also got the salted crab papaya salad - this was interesting and flavorful. Only disappointment there was no crab except one really small claw... maybe its just for flavor not actual meat but was a little bummed with the baby claw :(  Overall was very impressed with this new little local spot and will be back very soon - probably next week."}
{"text":"The pork dumplings are the best I've ever tried. Seriously can't stop thinking about them.  I would get 2 orders of them next time.  Run, don't walk to this amazing Thai restaurant.  I used to live in Thailand and am thrilled to be able to find some of my favorites right here in Phoenix.  The sticky rice with mango was delicious, sweet gooey and coconutty.  And the pad thai was good.  The service is excellent, my cup of water was always filled and the thai tea is delicious, ordered a 2nd.  And the chef personally came out to see how we liked the food, she had made everything fresh, which was reflected in the flavors of the dishes."}
{"text":"My boyfriend grew up eating home cooked Thai food so when we heard about this little place opening up, which specializes in Thai street food, we knew we had to give it a try. Its only been open for 5 days, yet its clear they're already getting tons of business (we saw multiple groups come and go despite it being 10PM when we came in).  We were worried that we would have a hard time finding it, but since its right next door to the old Mr Submarine shop, and very brightly and invitingly lit, there ended up being no problem. Parking was quick and easy and there was no wait to be seated. They have multiple seating options ranging from bar, patio, to their dining room and each is beautifully lit and cozy. We loved the farm house ambience with the soft Thai music playing in the background.   Their menu is still small at the moment as they work to expand but their wine list was quite impressive! Our waiter was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and answered any questions we had. We started out with an order of dumplings, which we were a bit dismayed to find were steamed dumplings when they arrived. However despite not usually being a fan of steamed dumplings, we both loved them, our only complaint was there weren't more of them!  When it came to our actual dishes we were a bit let down, unlike many other Thai restaurants, they did not ask for a desired heat level. This worried my boyfriend as he likes his food to be almost beyond eating with spiciness, and I can be a bit of a wimp. I had nothing to fear however as my dish wasn't very spicy at all, but he was let down as his was listed as spicy but lacked even enough heat for ME to register.  I'll admit that I have had very little Northern Thai dishes so I wasn't sure what to expect, and I was a bit let down. My dish was 80 percent rice, the pork belly mostly fatty and far from crispy, and lacking any of the signature tastes I look for in Thai food. My boyfriend's dish was very aromatic and had a very pleasant taste but reminded me more of Indian food than Thai in its seasonings.   All in all we were pretty let down, especially considering we ended up spending 40 plus dollars on two entrees, one Thai tea, and an appetizer when at most places we could have received twice that amount of food for the price. But as the restaurant gets its feet more on the ground we hope to come back and try more of their food, especially their Nom Tok (Thai beef salad) as that is one of my favorite dishes.   So give this place a try if you're looking for a casual yet intimate setting, or late night fare that isn't a Berto's (they're open until 11pm during the week and until 12:30pm on Fridays and Saturdays). Their food is locally sourced, they cater to any dietery restrictions you may have, and their staff are all wonderful!"}
{"text":"Delicious Vietnamese food. Not inexpensive compared to typical fare of this sort but well worth it for the taste."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant I've ever been to in my entire life I love the food the people experience the happiness of the culture here inside this restaurant I am going to cry as I continue to think about this what a beautiful restaurant five stars all around great job guys"}
{"text":"3 stars for the excellent service and very nice ambiance! Foods were not what I expected Pork skewers was flavorful but other than that nothing is memorable. Sausages taste off lack of herbs and seasoning, Kao soi wasn't close to what I had in Chieng-mai, Kana moo grob was good but came out with 4 pieces of pork belly didnt worth the $14, Pandan cream desert was really bland and too small portion."}
{"text":"The restaurant is quaint and intimate. While the tremendous service is the same. The servers were informative and walk you through the menu. The cocktails were unique and playfully concocted. I literally have no words for how on point the flavor combinations were in the food. I will be back to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Expensive. Overrated. Was not what I expected. I would rather go to Reathrey Sekong for a true Thai / Cambodian authentic experience. Food here not as good has such little portions. I thought it was going to be like pok pok in Portland Oregon. But It was such a disappointment. I won't be back here again. The wait was too long to pick up food. The waiters were nice at all. I kept getting ignored because people wanted to sit down and eat and I want to order to go."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout a few weeks ago and everything was phenomenal! I had a friend visiting, who used to live in Bangkok, and she was blown away by how good everything was. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The good is fantastic.  Dumplings are a must. The atmosphere is perfect for a date night. And the 2 owners are always there."}
{"text":"Cool decorations and concept! This is the real street food because they put food on top of the rice. I mean lots of rice like I used to get in Thailand. The khao soi is uniquely tasty. It is creamy from the coconut milk but it is not too much and I can still taste the broth. Also the food here is not too sweet, which is similar to the food in Thailand.  I am looking forward to the dessert menu!"}
{"text":"There's nothing contrived about Glai Baan. This is just good food. I've never had a bad meal here.  Drunken Noodles and Mackerel fried rice is my go-to.    Papaya salad with crab is awesome, and it is not catered towards a western palate.  Be adventurous, embrace the funk and you'll have a great meal.  Truly a gem for Phoenix."}
{"text":"Glai Baan currently operates out of the building that previously housed Mejico Cocina Mejicana, a pretty decent Mexican eatery that I was sad to see close its doors earlier this year. Their specialty is what they refer to as \"Thai Street Food,\" which appears to a combination of the traditional Thai dishes you're familiar with, combined with items that only hardcore fans of the food will probably recognize. It's an interesting concept that already appears to be generating a bit of a buzz on the social media circuit, although I'm still not sure what falls under the \"street food\" umbrella.  My girlfriend and I stopped by on a Saturday night and unexpectedly found the place to be pretty crowded. I've always liked the setup of the restaurant, with a nice, outdoor patio that's closed off with a wood-fence, giving the place sort of a \"backyard\" feel to it.   As usual, we ordered a couple of Thai teas. They offer an alcoholic variation on the drink, but we prefer keeping things basic. Their Thai tea is different in the sense that, it wasn't really sweet and did not have that ultra-mliky flavor that we've become accustomed to. This might make it different, but didn't necessarily make it better, in my opinion. We both agreed that we prefer the way it's usually prepared at other places - which is also cheaper than the four dollar asking price. But that's just personal preference, I guess.  For food, we started off with the silom road moo, which are basically pork skewers that were great quality and included a bit of very mildly spicy sauce for dipping. Additionally, we chose a dish that I cannot find on the most recently posted menu. It combined noodles with shrimp and a few other additions, one of which, had a very strange smell and acidic \"bite\" to it. My girlfriend liked it a bit more than I did. The smell reminded me of things I'd rather not mention in the review.  For main dishes, it was a rather tricky process. My girlfriend generally dislikes spicy food, while I can handle almost anything - or so I thought. Her options were very limited, since the majority of the items are noted as being spicy. She chose the ka na moo grob, which included stir fried broccoli, pork belly, rice, and what is referred to as a \"son in law\" egg. I went for the pad kee mao, which included a boatload of ingredients, including pork belly, broccoli, mushrooms, bamboo shoot, rice, egg, and both some chili and garlic.  Okay, so I'll openly admit that everything was very good quality. But as one of the other reviewers noted, the dishes are just so-damned-spicy! They don't do scales here, but my dish clearly hovered in the level 4-5 that you'd find at most traditional Thai restaurants. After a couple of bites, I could not really appreciate the food's quality, because the chili flakes completely dominated the entire dish.  My girlfriend's dish, on the other hand, was not listed as being spicy, but still was to the point where she had difficulty eating it. Chili flakes were still very much present. While it was definitely less harsh than mine, it was still spicy enough that the server should have inquired about her tolerance level. Once again, I'll state that the dish itself was very good quality, but after a few bites, it became very difficult to appreciate. I'm convinced that they actually overdid hers on accident.  We both quickly developed runny noses and watery eyes as a result, while listening to a table full of twenty-somethings that were situated way too close to our table, huffing and puffing through each bite for the same reason. Clearly, my spice tolerance isn't as high as I had originally assumed, as it took a good twelve hours before my body felt \"normal\" again after the spice wreaked total havoc on my digestive tract.   For dessert, they offer some steamed bread that's served with a dipping custard, which wasn't available. Instead, we opted for this alternative special, which included a slice of pumpkin that had some hardened custard inside, served with condensed milk. It was okay, but would have preferred to try their primary offering. Oh well.  Ultimately, while the food is good quality and will probably please a lot of people, I just can't bring myself to give the place more than two stars. I'm sure I'll receive death threats as a result. For the price we paid, we didn't really get a lot of food - and what little we did take with us, neither one of us will probably eat. Currently, this place is receiving glowingly positive reviews, but without an established spice-level system, I'd suggest being very careful about what you order unless you have a stomach made out of iron.  I'd recommend them, because I feel it's a place that everyone should at least try once. The environment is nice, although they only get partial credit - as this building had a nice vibe long before they occupied the space. But for us, personally, I think we'll stick to some of our established favorites."}
{"text":"This was my choice for my birthday dinner, was here on 10/20.  This restaurant has only been open a few weeks. The whole evening was great. The vibe and decor is cozy and warm. 2 of my favorite things were the saloon doors that led to the restrooms and the wrought iron door that led to the patio. I really wanted to take a lot more pictures of the interior of the restaurant but I didn't want to be rude. I liked how repurposed furniture was used to store utensils, napkins, etc. Water was served in tin cups. We sat on the back patio which was decorated with trees that were lit up. There were benches for sitting and chatting. The food was outstanding, if you closed your eyes, you would've thought you were in Thailand. We sampled many dishes but the sea bass was my favorite, flavorful and crisp. Food arrived quickly, and the servers were attentive. Since I am a girlie girl, I have to talk about the restrooms lol. There are 2 restrooms, very clean and also gender neutral. I'll never understand why more restaurants don't have gender neutral restrooms! My only suggestion would be to have some sort of changing station for patrons who have infants or young children. I highly recommend Glai Baan as it is a perfect place for date night, families, friends, celebrations. We drove from Surprise and it was so worth it.  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This is a Thai restaurant and they actually put a little blurb on their menu about how they model their food after a certain northwestern area of Thailand. Then they add that it can be quite spicy for that reason and they designate spicier dishes with a chili pepper. It's small plates which I find is a great way to try new things. The restaurant is tucked down on 24th and Osborn and it is quite adorable it looks like it was a house but that means it is small, not uncomfortable but small nonetheless. I will say that we went around 6 and as we were leaving every table was taken and the bar was full and at least 4 groups were waiting for a table. Always a good sign. Anyways the food was amazing. You have to be willing to try new things even if you can't pronounce them. Remember it's authentic so the Thai names are used and then there is a description. The dumplings were good. There was a noodle dish with shrimp and minced pork which I loved. The flavor was so good. We had a pork belly rice dish which had I known I would have asked for MILD spice cause it was hot for me but not bad for my friend. We also had a steak salad which was SUPER generous with the meat and again great flavor. There were a number of people who ordered some sort of mint green drink served in a champagne glass. Anyway I recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"We can't wait to come back and give them a try at a 5 star rating. The food and service are probably there, but it is a bit cramped and this is a personal thing, but i don't like drinking water out of a tin cup. I get that it may be a cute to some, but I'm not a fan. The service was super friendly and attentive. They have a well oiled machine and all work together in harmony. Creates a nice and enjoyable atmosphere, everyone was happy to be there! The food was enjoyable as well. Very fresh, tasty and well prepared. Our server had superior knowledge of the menu and was able to guide us in the direction we wanted to go. The Pad Thai was really yummy, the Larb and salad we had were awesome too.   Good experience, can't wait to go back and try more delicious Thai food!"}
{"text":"Went to Glai Baan last night, food portions are tiny, pretty expensive. We had about 5 cocktails, little cups. 10$/cocktail. Soup too sweet for us, everything was pretty sweet, the sauce that came with the chicken was too salty. will try again, if they are improved i will change the rating."}
{"text":"Went tonight for the first time, and I really loved this place... The food was delicious. It was by far the best Thai food I've ever had in Phoenix and, honestly, among the best meals I've had here, period. The pad thai is wonderful, and so is the larb. We also had a special: panang curry with beef ribs. It was really tasty and complex.  The building is lovely and has a garden with outdoor seating, too. Prices are reasonable for the quality.  They're still working out the kinks with some service stuff (they've only been open for nine days), but everyone was super friendly."}
{"text":"Solid place.  Our new favorite Thai restaurant .  Great patio on the side. We got there at 4:55 on a Saturday and there were already 6 other ppl waiting to get in when it iopens. So the word is already out on this place."}
{"text":"Do not come here if you think this is your typical Westernized Thai joint. Come to Glai Baan ONLY if you want try something entirely new and take your palette on an adventure.   Atmosphere: It feels like you're in a historic AZ home, that has been transported to a village bar in Thailand.   Service: These people are all about the food. There is no glitz and no kitch. It's all about the flavor. That's not to say the service isn't warm. It is. But there won't be any plastic smiles or \"Let me tell you about the specials\". It's all about the food.   Cocktails: I had a Mekong, mostly because Roger Clyne talks about it in his music and I always wanted to see what it tastes like. It was delightful. However, would've preferred it as a digestif. It has that herbal and sweet thing that's great after a meal. The Orange Blossom Ale from Huss was the perfect compliment to the spice and citrus components of the food.   Food: We did the Dumplings...cuz ya kinda have to...and this crab noodle salad. The salad was very unique and refreshing; rice noodles, cherry tomatoes, the perfect amount of spice, and crab as more a seasoning than the star of the dish. The Panang totally ruined all other Panang curries for me. I had their equivalent of Drunken Noodles, which I cannot remember the name of. Pork Belly, wide rice noodles, and again...perfect spice. But, I like spicy, so do not think it's for everyone. They are more than happy to tone it down for the sensitive tum-tums. out there."}
{"text":"I've never had Thai food like this both in presentation and taste. That's not to say other Thai places in Phoenix aren't good, it's just that this was really exciting and unique. Great location too. It's more expensive than other Thai places probably but I felt it was deserved. If your exposure to thai is mostly pad Thai do yourself a favor and try the less familiar dishes they serve (Also the pad Thai there is great )"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai spot in Phoenix, hands down. Came here late on a Saturday night to enjoy some cocktails and noodles but ended up trying several additional items on the menu that blew me away. First off, the decor of this place was so warm and inviting. It looks like a cute little house from the outside and when you walk in there are so many details that really make you feel like you're in Thailand...from old photographs of the King on the walls, to the authentic Thai tablecloths, sauce caddies and tableware. We ordered the Thai Hive and Laab Sided cocktails. BOTH were so delicious! Who would've thought fish sauce would taste good in a cocktail?! For food, we tried the Mu ping (pork skewers) which were so tender and juicy, the mussels which that broth was DIVINE and I am still salivating thinking about it, and the beef salad which was an explosion of flavor in every bite. We also had the Tom Sap and Tom Yum noodles which were SO GOOD and so satisfying, transporting us back to Thailand :) I later came to find out that all their meat is from local butchers and they use organic vegetables and even edible flowers! No wonder why everything tasted SO FRESHH. Staff was extremely friendly as well! I am so happy to have found this place and will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"The pork dumplings we're really good. Papaya salad was also good. But we didn't listen and o our waitress and we got it with fried port belly instead of crab. I thought I would break a trip other so I didn't eat it. Wine options were actually very well done to work with the spices   No t as impressed as the locals. Could b we have better options"}
{"text":"Delicious!  The food was fantastic and the ambiance was adorable.  The flavors were great in all of the dishes, my husband who spent time in Thailand was not disappointed.  Our favorite things were the beef panang curry (a special) and the \"adult\" Thai tea (Thai tea spiked with rum).  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The drinks were very tasty and the chicken wings were delicious. Our main course took about 40 minutes to come out and was very anti-climatic. The food tasted decent so I won't give it a bad rating but for how long it took and the taste I certainly won't give it much more than three. We will definitely be back for drinks. Great ambiance!"}
{"text":"Super cute place for unexpected street thai food in PHX.  Smaller menu than expected and very heavy on meat.  However, when I told the waiter I mainly eat fish or prefer vegetarian dishes he was able to drill down to menu items where the protein was interchangeable.    Small list of craft cocktails and decent wine selection were perfect for pairing with the spicy selections The back patio felt like a friend's backyard.  It lived up to the hype from magazine write ups!  Glad we checked this place out"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Thai food I have eaten! The raw shrimp appetizer is the perfect blend of spice, lime, mint, cilantro with crispy cabbage. To really know it's good, one must try the pad Thai. We ordered ours with shrimp. It was perfect in every way.  Seriously, this is SO tasty!"}
{"text":"Delish lil place!  Open till midnight on Friday and Saturday which is awesome. We had fantastic service and the food was great. Looking forward to coming bacm"}
{"text":"This place is freaking delish. All the stars, all of them. So impressed. Authentically Thai."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Thai Food! The experience was fantastic. The servers were very attentive and helpful with recommendations on the menu. The menu was short but had a variety of dishes. I would definitely recommend the dumplings and the Pad Thai was delicious! We also met the owner of the restaurant who was very friendly and made sure we had a great experience. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great discovery. Authentic Thai street food. Amazingly flavorful dishes. Excellent service. The Tom zap soup is now my go to soup!"}
{"text":"We were driving to our house in downtown from an event in Tempe, and saw this place on Yelp. The drinks are incredible, there's one with toasted rice that is savory, but absolutely delicious. The cooks use the highest quality ingredients, and the menu is not the common Thai restaurant, but a more authentic and creative take. The service was also vey friendly and they even gabe us a free dessert at the end!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this enchanting little restaurant on my way home the other night and I'm so glad! It has to be the cutest Thai restaurant in Phoenix. The staff was very friendly and attentive, we didn't wait long for anything. The bartender was charming and he happily described the flavors in their unique specialty cocktails, making it easier to pick one. The food was delicious. It was unbelievably light and flavorful! They have a nice selection of menu items you won't find at other places. It was really great! I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I know nothing about Thai food. But I know what I like, and I like Glai Baan. So will you.   With an emphasis on \"street food\", they specialize in spicy small plates you won't see much of anywhere else. And...well, noodles. But unlike the million 'tapas' places popping up, it likes to be warm and cozy. Not flashy at all. Water served slightly cool in tiny tin cups. Food on flimsy plates. No ambient lights or DJs or anything. It is humble, but I don't think it needs all the bells and whistles of trendier competition to be successful.  I am really not much of a noodle person, but I gave the pad kee mao a try and was not disappointed. Think Pad Thai, but with pork. Included with the plate was a large serving of uncut green onions, bean sprouts, and dry spices (salt, peanuts, and chili flakes) as opposed to the array of sauces I'm accustomed to for this cuisine. They will warn you about spice, which I love because I'm tired of your sensitive palates ruining it for the rest of us.  I paired this with an innovative selection from their limited cocktail list: The Thai Hive (Jasmine Gin, Chili Honey, lemon juice, fish sauce) sounds stomach-turning but is refreshing, tart, and packs a wallop. Other drinks feature baiju, black vinegar, or even shallots and toasted rice.   This is the innovation we NEED in the local dining scene, all at reasonable portions and price points. I'm already excited to return!"}
{"text":"Probably won't ever come here again. The portions are ridiculously small for a 15 dollar plate. The pad see ew should have been able to feed two people for that price but could barely even satisfy 1 from the amount they put. Tasted great but you would need to pay 45 bucks to feed one person."}
{"text":"Spot on! Very nice menu.  The quality was great tried 5 different dishes.  4 out of 5 were excellent.  And 1 dish was ok...  4 out of 5 stars only because I was under the impression that it was Thai \"street food\".    I think the concept is great but delivers a confusing message on Menu with portions and pricepoint.  Just go Northern Thai restaurant...  you are after all a restaurant!  Great wine program/beverage program....!  I have a feeling on my next visit I will be changing it to 5 stars...  Thanks for being in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I stopped by tonight for takeout and sampled a bunch of menu items: son in law eggs (deep fried soft-boiled with nuom choc), beef panang, pad Thai, papaya salad, and sausage with pepper relish. Everything was so delicious and a refreshing change from every other Thai place around.   The patio and dining room are lovely. The service was excellent. The bar is stocked and the people next to me were raving about their drinks.   Can't wait to go back!  Editing to add I am finishing off my leftover Panang for lunch and I am so sad I don't have more. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend; we have gone twice now. It is really good Thai food and the service is great too. It is authentic Thai and feels homey. We love going here."}
{"text":"Our good friend Tom G. recommended this exceptional new Thai restaurant. We joined him there last night and sat at the bar with Maxwell. The food was unreal! We did family style so we could try multiple items. All the flavors were incredible & our mixologist/bartender was knowledgeable & hilarious. This place is one of our new favorite spots & the Chef/Owner even came out at the end and spoke with us. She was delightful. We were extremely impressed to say the least. Love the friendly staff, the delicious food and the first-rate service!!! Check it out and hang with Maxwell if there is open space at the bar. You'll be glad you did :D"}
{"text":"Loved this place and I don't even like Thai food that much...I guess that's because I've never had good Thai food before (until now)! First of all the ambiance is great, very intimate and cozy. I'm pregnant so I couldn't partake in any of their cocktails but they looked great and I'm excited to try them someday! Had the pork dumplings to start, pad Thai with shrimp for entree and mango sticky rice for dessert (definitely don't skip this dish). All were fresh and so delicious! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Such a hip little spot. Love the charming interiors and patio. The food is delicious. The staff was the most memorable as they were so incredibly kind and generous!! So lovely!"}
{"text":"Top-notch Thai food with a good vibe. Try the son-in-law eggs. They were fantastic, and I'd never had them before."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago with my friend Brian. Everything was really great. Owners are very nice and friendly. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Yes!! Do it! Great street food from all regions of thailand! The grilled pork skewers were perfectly charred. The papaya salad was fresh and bright. The cocktails were unique and delicious as well."}
{"text":"Finally, there's a neighborhood Thai restaurant with a delightful ambiance. We gone there twice now and loving sitting at the bar. One of our favorite bartenders is Max who is very attentive and knowledgeable on food and drinks. I read complaints that they don't ask about the heat level. I don't remember being asked but we like it spicy. For those who don't like it hot, please note that mild to me is hot to others. It's best you don't get it spicy and ask for a side of Thai chili. They come in dry and/or fresh forms so you can control the spice level of you dish."}
{"text":"It was kind of busy for a Tuesday night but the staff was very friendly and the wait wasn't nearly as long as they estimated. When seated, the waiter was very professional; friendly; and gave good suggestions. The menu had plenty of great options but wasn't too over one page which is great! The food was fresh and very tasty. The restaurant is super cute: small and homely. Oh the portion size is really nice."}
{"text":"Made the trek out here the other day based on reviews this was more authentic than the rest of Phoenix...  While this may be true it wasn't quite the experience we thought it would be. Don't let that detract you from going, though. The food we tried from the somewhat limited menu was pretty good. I'd stop short of calling it our new go to Thai due to the lack of some staple items such as yellow and green curry. I'd say it felt more like a gourmet fusion influenced by Thai. That being said, the establishment has a cozy feel and an awesome, romantic patio setting that you'll enjoy sharing on date night. The staff are super nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner on a Saturday - patio dining due to a perfect November evening.  The bartender was very friendly and happy to share pronunciations and explanations of food/drink.  Once our dumplings arrived we moved to the patio.  I asked if they could turn 'up' the music as the dead space could have been filled with some relaxing tunes.  We ordered the spicy papaya salad, a noodle and rice dish...all delicious!!! Food came out quickly, service fairly attentive, and overall we are hooked on the dumplings...back next time for those and perhaps soup!!"}
{"text":"Loved our first experience at Glai Baan. When we walked in, it was a positive zoo- which surprised us for a Wednesday night.  However, we were able to snag seats to order dinner from the Bar.  I studied Yelp for suggestions and looked at friends photos to determine some of the better plates to order. We decided on a bunch of small plates to share and proceeded to order 5 dishes.  We settled on the Salted Crab & Papaya salad- which is a staple. We also tried the pork Dumplings, which were delicious. Last, we ordered a dish of minced pork and the Son-in-law eggs (deep fried soft boiled eggs).   From the nightly special we ordered raw shrimp (side note- I dont think I've ever had raw uncooked shrimp- the sauce accompanied it was delicious). Also had the crispy beef ribs- which were more to nibble on.  Lastly, desert was a traditional Thai street food desert of sweet bread and a very sweet cream to dip it in. It was light and airy and delicious! Can't wait to come back in and order the other 1/2 is the menu we didn't get to yet!"}
{"text":"This place is truly amazing! the minute that you walk in you realize that you were in a special place. the food is fantastic, the service is superb, I cannot wait to come back. thank you so much!"}
{"text":"The food is good but not good enough for the price. Simple dishes are over priced. I really wanted to love this spot since it is in the neighborhood but it comes up short compared to other local Thai restaurants. The staff seemed nice and attentive so I give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing! Such good food! Very authentic and I love their cocktails too! So happy this place opened in my neighborhood and I love the atmosphere of this place!"}
{"text":"Authentic khao soi. Amazing. Seriously strong menu all around."}
{"text":"I want to keep Glai Baan all to myself! Alas, now you will know my deep secret, for this Thai food place is your next date night bistro, friend catch up scene, or place to take out of town diners.  Tucked away on Osborn and 24th, this itty bitty restaurant is cozy, romantic, dimly lit, and the setting for homecooked Thai food. We ordered three starters: steamed pork dumplings, papaya salad with crispy pork belly, and pork skewers in coconut milk and garlic - really, are you salivating yet? As mentioned before, everything tasted homecooked, and delicious. The steamed pork dumplings were made with love while the pork skewers were plump and tender. The papya salad was not far behind with fresh, crisp vegetables and yummy pork belly. For the entrée, I ordered the Kapro Gai Kai Dao, or the minced chicken with onion, garlic, chili, Thai basil, egg, and rice. It sounds like a simple dish but this was jam-packed with flavor and complexity. It was one of the best Thai entrees I've had in a long time! Finally, I also ordered The Anywhere Door for my choice of beverage, which had Thai tea with rum. The flavors surprisingly went very smoothly together, and I sipped on it fairly quickly, so it was gone before I knew it. Do yourself a favor and treat 'yo self to Glai Baan. If you're a Thai food fan or foodie, you definitely won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner and I'm in love! I had the green curry with rice noodles-one of the specials of the evening and it was one of the best green curries I've had in a long time. The flavors are spot on and the chicken was so tender and juicy! The steamed pork dumplings were to die for! They had good texture and a very nice dipping sauce. The Panang curry had a big chunk of braised beef that also was delicious.  We sat outside on the patio which is lit with lights and the restaurant itself is so cute with vines all over and has a super cool relaxed eclectic atmosphere.  Service was great too! Will be back for sure to try more dishes! They really do Thai right here! Check it out! Was so good that we didn't even take pictures!"}
{"text":"You have to try this restaurant! Beautiful atmosphere with amazing food and people! Fully expect to become a regular here :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. I went to Thailand at the end of 2017 and this place took me back.  Authentic Thai food from the northern region. I was part of a party of 4 and when we ordered only 2 of the 4 meals came, but the chef was so kind and came out to apologize for the long wait for the other 2 food to come out and comped the 2 meals. The staff are so friendly. The Phuket Bucket cocktail drink (for 2+ people) was good. So in summary: * Great Thai food from the Northern Region of Thailand. * Food: Kao Soi is delicious, Fried Chicken and the Jungle Curry Special * Drink: Phuket Bucket"}
{"text":"I would give them more stars if I could! The owners are so accommodating and the service is phenomenal. On top of that, the owner/chef has brought back from Thailand her authentic dishes and touches to the restaurant. My hubby and I go probably once a week since we live so close and love to order the son-in-law eggs and sticky rice. Well probably try every dish by the end of the month. So happy to see an excellent restaurant open in our neighborhood!!!"}
{"text":"I am a foodie who loves the Asian continent and this is my favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix!  Great vibe and the food is vibrant and fresh.  Perfect umami balance.  Great neighborhood spot.  A real gem!"}
{"text":"I am going to rate this restaurant a 6 out of 10 because I am Thai and I know what the food should taste like back home. By far the appetizers  were good but the main dishes were horrible. The price was way too high . The most important thing is the food was nit authentic. I had a green curry which is not suppose to have beansprout in it but the waitress said it was suppose to be. So not true. Bottom line.... I am not going to recommend this restaurant to anyone"}
{"text":"The best of authentic Thai food! Great Ambiance with an outside patio. I love their dumplings!  Owners are so friendly and accommodating! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The service is great. The food is high quality. Rotating specials, indoor/outdoor seating, overall a great experience. The food is a little pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"Here for short business trip.. Every one was super Friendly along with excellent services. Cute little place with Great tasting food."}
{"text":"Barely receiving my meal and it has been amazing since we got here! It was a great spontaneous place for a first date with my roomie! The owners, wait staff and bartender all went out of their way to give genuine exchanges. The customer service is genuine and great. I will be back again. To top it off the owner is a cook and t is soooo good. They were very accommodating with my porkless needs."}
{"text":"I made my return visit, as promised. Much better this time! A friend and I got the dumplings (which were strangely not as good as the first time, but still good), son in law eggs (so savory and delish), the ground chicken and rice dish with the fried egg, and the pad kee Mao (this time with crispy pork belly, which wasn't an option last time, but cost an additional 1$). The entrees were super good. The pad kee Mao was so much better this time..... I asked for spicy (again) but this time they made it SPICY !  The heat was perfectly balanced with basil leaves and did not overtake the flavor of the dish while still making my nose run. It was, unfortunately, way too spicy for my buddy, but, hey.... If you ask for spicy, can't complain about the heat. The crispy pork belly was so much better than the original.... It cut down on that weird gelatinous texture you can get from pork belly and left you with crispy, yet tender pieces of meat. The ground chicken dish was also a winner.... It was super savory with a touch of sweetness.... The egg was fried crispy on the bottom and still slightly runny on the top.... It was awesome. Additionally, the leftovers were fabulous! The only down sides I can see are A) the inconsistency.... Last time was not so good.... This time was great and B) the price..... Their prices are kinda outrageous. A plate of noodles in Phoenix should probably not cost 15$. I understand they cannot charge Thai prices (in Thailand, I got plates of noodles for 1$), but this isn't new york city either. I spent 30$ for dinner, which is a bit high for Thai food. Anyway, will the price keep me from coming back? No.... But I definitely won't come as often as I would if plates were closer to the 10-12$ range."}
{"text":"This is THAI FOOD.   If you have Thai friends, and you eat with them a lot, they will fill you in on certain things. Such as, when eating Thai food, you typically use a spoon in the dominant hand, (fork in the other) and chopsticks are most often reserved for noodles. You may have also heard that Pad Thai, the dish everyone in the west thinks of as the quintessential Thai dish, is actually not very prolific in Thailand, and Thai folks are notoriously picky about the execution of this dish. In short, if you always order Pad Thai at Thai restaurants, you're doing it wrong.   However, at Glai Baan it's a different story. Pad Thai here is true Pad Thai. It's not overly oily, or sweet. It comes with lime to squeeze over it. The right kind of chives are used, and the flavors are subtle whilst still bold.   A highlight for me was the som tum (papaya salad) is also offered in the extra spicy rendition that features fermented crab legs. A dish like this is typically reserved for Thai customers, as a lot of folks find the ultra pungence of the crab to be off-putting. However, if you know this flavor and are sure you love it - you will not be disappointed here. This is hard to find!!!   Though all the dishes are faithful to authenticity whilst also showing a bit of tasteful creative attitude, the Nam tok was executed in a way that really elevated the dish. Aside from the perfectly toasted rice granules and rare beef, a sprinkling of micro fennel adds the perfect touch to this dish - and now I feel I must learn to grow this microgreen at home in order to enjoy nam tok properly. It's that good.   We sampled more than half of the menu, and tried various wines and beers throughout the meal. Thai food pairs best with cocktails, crisp white wines or wheat beer, and these are well represented at the bar. Personally, I tend toward rich reds when eating Thai, and the Côtes du Rhône blend served my palate well.   At the end of the meal we were surprised to discover that a favorite, and very hard-to-find in the states Thai dessert was available: pandan cream with soft bread, of which I cannot remember the Thai name. If you are unfamiliar with pandan, think of it as a subtle/quiet flavor for sweets. In the west, this might be akin to vanilla, but a bit more subtle. Whatever it is, I cannot get enough of it, and it is used in a wide variety of Thai desserts. At Glai Baan, they use a soft, thick bread similar to texas toast but more luxurious if that makes sense, and it is dipped in a custard cream imbibed with the soft, green goodness that is pandan. The sticky rice and mango dessert is mandatory, as you know - and it is also done to perfection, a faint flavoring of pandan is present in this as well.   As mentioned in several reviews, the ambiance here is soft, comfortable, yet not overly-dim. I'd feel most comfortable wearing something like beach-formal attire here, and I'll wait as long as needed in order to sit outside with the ficus trees and the strings of lights glowing softly in the branches. Magical, it is.   Really though, to our party who dined here last night, this place is the best. The menu is devoid of pretense, and based on the non-designed styling of the content of this menu that even I, as a graphic designer adore for several reasons, is updated as the offerings change. It would be a good idea to come often if one lived in Phoenix, as this environment, the staff and the plates they set before you are uplifting and inspiring.   I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix. Arroy mak, krab!"}
{"text":"Glai Baan has managed to push all the other Thai restaurants I like down a slot and claim first place with me. I like that they offer items you can't get at other Thai eateries. Their specialty is Thai street food but they have things like pad Thai for the more vanilla taste buds.  My favorite item has to be those darn pork dumplings. They are very similar to the xiao long bao you can get at Chinese soup dumpling restaurants. They were so flavorful, so tender that my party and I ordered another plate of them. I also had the very aromatic Thai sausage. We did order pad Thai which was very tasty. I also had the son-in-law eggs, which are boiled and fried. They were good but I don't think I would pay money for just ONE egg.  The ambience is really like every other Thai restaurant in Phoenix. Pictures of the king (RIP), simple wooden chairs and tables and loud table cloths for the patio. Anyway, with the way they cook, I don't care what the decor is. Looking forward to a return visit!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential but there are some kinks that need to be ironed out. I'm not sure if Friday nights are normally as busy but it was a packed house. So we did have to wait 25 minutes for a table (which I never have a problem with.)   Since we had a bit of a wait, I went up to the bar to get us some drinks. The bartender told me I wasn't allowed to order drinks from the bar on my own and that our server has to get the drinks. I told him that we haven't been seated yet and would like a drink while we wait. He again told me I could not order and told me to go back to the waiting area and he would come out to get my drink order. Aside from that being a rather odd rule that customers can't order drinks from the bar, he never came out to get our drink order as he said he would. So right away that left a bad impression before even being seated.  Once seated, our server was nice but seemed very distracted. Most of the time as we were speaking to him, he'd be looking off in other directions as if he had somewhere else to be. He wasn't very social and almost seemed uncomfortable.   Service was slow but I do understand that since it was a busy night so let's get to the food itself. We ordered Pot Stickers and Asian Wings as appetizers. The Pot Stickers were the best I've had and absolutely worth ordering. The wings, not so much. They were so over deep fried that there was a burnt taste to them that even the sauce couldn't cover up. However, the main dishes were all very good. I had a chicken curry noodle soup dish (Kao Soi) and it was by far the most flavorful noodle dish I've ever tasted. It wasn't overwhelmingly spicy and had the perfect amount of substance. My friend had the Pad Thai, which was good and my husband had a noodle and rice dish that was also very flavorful.   Overall, the food is good and worth trying if you like authentic Thai cuisine. The strange rule from the bartender of not being able to order drinks while waiting 25 minutes for a seat is rather odd and I hope isn't a normal rule."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying I've been coming here every Tuesday for the past 3 weeks.  I eat out everyday, I love Thai food, this place is hands down the best Thai restaurant I've been to. The dumplings are amazing!!!!  The bucket with coconut water is so refreshing.  I always get the Kapro gal with shrimp and chicken, it's so flavorful, it's just right.  Yum"}
{"text":"So dang good. Rivals any Thai food I've had anywhere - NYC, San Francisco, Chicago, LA. Delicate, flavorful but not heavy or overdone, fresh, perfectly cooked, AND affordable in a cute location with a cool vibe. This place nails it. Completely worth hunting for a parking space."}
{"text":"What a cute restaurant.  The server was friendly and informative, but the food was not to my liking.  My friend and I ordered a bunch of dishes to share and we could not pinpoint a favorite because they were all pretty mediocre.  The biggest laugh of it all?  The sticky rice.  It's $2 and it comes in this wicker type of basket thing.  When I pulled it out, it was wrapped in saran wrap.  And it was literally just a ball of rice.  My friend giggled as she said it looked like I was holding up a used condom.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry to be so harsh, but that is such a rip off.  It wasn't even sweet.  In my mind, when you order sticky rice, if it doesn't come with sliced mangoes, it should at least be covered with coconut milk.  Not just a ball of rice wrapped in saran wrap.  I cannot say I will be back but I can at least cross this one off my list of places to visit."}
{"text":"great service but the food was mediocre besides the dumplings. The menu is uber limited like someone that watched too much Kitchen Nightmares and the staples arent that interesting. The noodle and chick dish was small portions and bland. The green curry that was on special had a nice taste but then paired with eggplant and rice noodles versus rice ruined what could have been a good dish but it wouldn't matter, it was just a special. The portions of meat were too small and its flavor seems like it was all cooked at the same time and then added after.  I wont be back considering the other great thai restaurants in the area like Thaiger or Thairama depending on the dish you are craving."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place especially because not too many restaurants have kao soi but unfortunately it just didn't live up to my hopes.   The interior is so cute and perfect for a date night, and the service was good. Also it's open late which is awesome.   So I actually got the kao soi there and it was okay they really slumped on the sprouts and it was just not very flavorful.   My roommates wanted food to go and we got the laab, pad thai, and kraplao kai dow. All so bland. I got level 3 spicy out of 4 and I could barely taste the spice.   Pretty bummed especially because it's a little pricy."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai restaurant in Phoenix. Their menu is small and intentional - everything is very authentic with unique flavors. The owners have remembered us each time we've come and it has such a welcoming atmosphere. I highly recommend sitting on the patio under the tea lights and ordering the chicken wings. They will 100% change your life. We also ordered the crab fried rice and there was a good amount of crab in it. It had onions and a lime in it with an awesome fish sauce to add to the top. We also ordered the mussels. The sauce the mussels come in is so good on white rice! Would definitely recommend ordering an extra side of rice to pour all your extra sauces on at the end. Our waitress also provided great service and helped us choose the best items on the menu (not that you can go wrong). Great restaurant for a date night or to celebrate a birthday."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic Saturday night dinner at Glai Baan! Service was spot-on and the ambiance was trendy but cozy. Every single dish we got was excellent. My favorites in particular were the pork skewers and the mussels. Also, definitely get the kanom custard for dessert! We will be returning soon to try the rest of the menu. If you are looking for a delicious and slightly more upscale Thai dining experience, give Glai Baan a try."}
{"text":"I would have given this 4 stars but our service was not great. I enjoyed the papaya salad, we ordered it with some sticky rice and it was pretty good. I ordered the kao soi and I thought it was perfectly spiced and very creamy. The curry flavor wasn't over powering but you do have to like curry to enjoy this dish. The noodles were really nicely cooked and I enjoyed the chicken even though I'm usually not a fan of it. They will NOT customize anything on the menu. My friend is a vegan and she asked for tofu and no egg for her noodle dish. The server made a pretty big deal about it and was rude in the process. He then kept trying to get her to eat things with animal products. He said he would only customize for food allergies and eventually said he would make her the noodles with tofu and no egg. Then the noodles came out with egg in it. They were delicious but the service is pretty lacking. I understand not being able to customize orders but to say you'll do it and then bring the food out with egg in it is annoying. He wasn't very friendly about it either. Parking is scarce and if you sit inside it's pretty loud. The outdoor seating is cute but it's getting hotter outside so it won't be enjoyable for too much longer. I would recommend trying this place."}
