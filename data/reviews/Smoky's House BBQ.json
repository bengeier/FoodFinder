{"text":"Love the wings here! Decently priced, great texture and awesome flavors! I've gotten wings here so many times, never once had any trouble with price, timing or order errors. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was decent. I had the brisket dinner. Order arrived within 5 minutes. The sides (Au Gratin Taters and Mac and Cheese) seemed like it had been made a while ago and was just sitting there. Brisket was a little dry...I've had much better. Corn bread was good though. Service was horrible. There were 3 tables and two waitresses and she came by to take our order, bring out the food, and get our checks. She didn't refill the water or stop any other time. Her \"have a good day\" also wasn't convincing."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. My mom and I stopped by for the first time a week ago and we could not stop talking about how good the food was for the rest of the day.

The service is very friendly and super fast! The prices are also pretty good for a BBQ place with big portions."}
{"text":"Smokey's is one of the BEST bbq places in the Chambana area. Lyle is the best server: amazing customer service, friendly, and easy to talk to. Literally everything on the menu is AMAZING. Traditional Southern BBQ with amazing flavor and char to all of the meats. It also is affordable, there is a wide variety of delicious sides, and easily accessible on the Yellow. Basically, this place is TO DIE FOR!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner. It was about 6:45 on a Saturday night. It wasn't packed but I would say 75% of the tables were occupied. We both ordered a brisket dinner. It took at least 1/2 an hour to get our food. Since brisket would already be cooked and the sides would already be prepared, this was way too long.
We waited at least 10 minutes for iced tea as they had to make more. It was good tea, but at what would normally be a peak time and given the fact there seemed to be a lot of wait and hostess staff for the number of patrons, this was our first clue that the service might be an issue.
We sat and watched at least 5 tables that came in after us get served before us. There was no explanation and the waitress told us she gave us $5 off for having to wait so long but that was not reflected on our bill.
The brisket was good and the portion generous but we didn't like the pit beans, especially compared to Black Dog or what Smoke served. The O&V slaw was ok. My husband got the au gratin potatoes and liked them. None of the 5 sauces wowed us.
I might try to carry out some lunch specials as I'd like to try a couple of other things like the smoked pepper turkey, but as far as going in to sit down & eat, nope."}
{"text":"APPETIZERS
We arrived as Smoky's and were really interested to try the food since I have been smoking meat for about 4 years now and I know my smoked meats. We got the sweet potato fries which were totally fresh and just cut. The fried okra was out of this world! I have high standards and can normally tell when things are frozen and not fresh. This was not frozen and freshly made. I asked for some of the queso cheese on the side and it was also very tasty and not from a can. It was more of a beer based cheese dip but very flavorful.  And also got the BBQ salad to balance out the meal. Really cool display and for only $7 it was awesome! And the V and O slaw was the best! Thank you for not having a slaw with NO mayo! 

NOW TO THE MEAT! 
We tried a platter that had 4 or 5 smoked meats on it for $31 and included 2 sides and the corn muffins. Every single piece of meat was fresh and out of this world. And you didn't have to worry about paying extra for sauces(like you do at Black Dog). It was in bottles next to your table. We especially liked the Mango Chipotle and the Mostly Mustard. You could sample all of them and put as much as you wanted on the meat. And then the waitress was so kind to bring us cups to fill up the sauce for our leftovers. And we now have leftovers for at least 2 more meals for the both of us. 

THE SERVICE!
The waitress was fast and very friendly! She went above and beyond to help us out and was so easy going. We left her a nice tip! She seemed to be handling most of the orders herself and had a happy I am working here feeling. The manager or maybe cook came out after to ask us how we liked our meal. And not in an intrusive or robotic way that a lot of the chain restaurant managers come to ask about your meal. He was genuine and really cared about how the meal was for us. We walked out and both were blown away in everything we ate and the service."}
{"text":"Usually good food however today everything dry. Wings how could that be?However the is waitresses cute."}
{"text":"Smokeys. I call them the poor man's black dog. Not that Black dog's all that expensive but its hard to get in etc. Anyway, this place really holds it's own. Burnt ends are wonderful. Sauces are creative and just the right sweet and hot. Service is friendly - complete with the southern drawl. 

Perfect game day eats."}
{"text":"Smoky's House is a welcome addition to the area, my only complaints are that their about the same price point as Hickory River BBQ, but then they have table service, which means you have to tip in addition to the meal you receive; this is something I take into consideration when going out to eat.  If I'm paying to tip someone, I'm expecting another notch up on the experience, it should be a really special meal and I don't think this quite makes it.  As a result this will cause me to dine here less.  Also, they bring your your meat without the sauce, the sauce is offered in a variety of flavors and hotness, the problem is that the sauce is room-temperature cool, which I don't like on my hot meat.  The particular day that I was there, it was fairly busy and I wasn't able to get my refill very quickly, in fact she told me she was going to get it and became distracted with other customers and didn't get my refill to me until my food was gone; I don't like eating without having something to drink, I almost didn't leave a tip, but thanks to my guilty conscience I left one anyway even though it's supposed to be based on performance.  As far as I'm concerned, the wait staff doesn't do that much, the refill drink is the most crucial thing to me, if you're not going to let me get up to get it myself.  The food was standard, but different than what you'll find in the area, so a nice addition to the variety.  The meat (I had pulled pork) was very smokey flavored, I liked the texture, it was just about perfect really, I guess I would use a pasta term and call it al dente.  The steak fries were fantastic, almost as good as the ones I miss from Pickles; crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and a nice natural flavor.  I'll definitely go back, just not as often as I would like due to the additional costs.  I hope they find a way to warm up their sauces or just add them to the meat to order."}
{"text":"Smoky...tasty stuff, the smokin fried wings are outstanding - got my face all nasty eating them. I'm not a big fan of the cheese sauce, though you may like it.  the pit beans are to die for... I had the burnt ends and they were outstanding. I like black dog but this place has two things Black Dog doesn't have - parking, plenty of space and the size of the restaurant, you can sit lots of people.  Experiment if you like, but the basics will keep me coming back baby! :-)"}
{"text":"I found out that my wife and I would be having dinner tonight sans kids, so we elected to try this new place we had heard about in an advertisement: Smoky's House BBQ in the Savoy Plaza.

There was a decent crowd for a Sunday evening. We were promptly greeted and seated. Service throughout the meal was excellent.

My wife, being a former resident of Springfield, IL, home of the horseshoe, decided on the Pulled Pork Muleshoe. The muleshoe consisted of the Texas toast, meat of your choice, cheese sauce and french fries. She selected the pulled pork and added some of the Memphis Sweet sauce. She said that it was pretty good but she thought it was a tad on the small side.

I opted for a Texas sliced brisket sandwich served southern style -- with creamy slaw on it. I mixed the Memphis Sweet and the A Little Heat sauces. For my two sides, I selected mac & cheese and asked our waitress for a recommendation for the other. She suggested the Pit Beans.

The sandwich was served without sauce, which was fine. The meat had a nice smokey flavor. The mix of sauces was outstanding, as was the order of pit beans. The mac & cheese looked like it was Kraft's -- small, thin noodles and a suspiciously familiar, yet tasty, cheese sauce.

In summary, the meal was pretty good and did not bust our pocketbooks. I suspect that this restaurant will capture bbq fans on the south side of Champaign and in Savoy. It seems to me that it is off to a good start."}
{"text":"First, BlackDog is hands down better. I hold no allegiance to any place, only good tasting food. The food here was overall average. I purchased pulled pork platter, a slice of pecan pie, corn bread, mac & cheese, and pit beans, and a couple slabs of ribs from my friend's plate. 

-The first atrocity was committed by their mac & cheese--if you can call it that. It was straight up, craft blue box mac & cheese. The semi-long cyclinder noodles with cheese sauce. The same cheese sauce they put on their speciality fries. Of all the dishes, I felt insulted that they'd even call this mac & cheese. Not up to the level of even a DECENT BBQ place. 

-The Pecan pie was also insulting. For $3 you get the smallest piece of pie you have ever seen. Should have just went next door to Schnuk's to get a full pie for the same price. 

-The cornbread wasn't bad. Pretty tasty, and a very large portion.  

-Pit beans were a little bit above average.

-The pulled pork was pretty decent. If you are having a BBQ fix, the pulled pork will serve it's purpose. 

-Ribs were extremely dry and burnt. Burnt can be good if they apply a good rub. They, did not. 

Overall, if you want some real, legitimate, even decent BBQ, I would just make the trek to Black Dog. Living in Savoy, i thought the opening of this place would be a saving grace. Truth be told, I'd rather drive to Urbana and get some real tasty BBQ food than waste my money here. Not trying to be a jerk, just brutally honest.

Oh yeah, if you order to go, make sure to ask for ample BBQ sauce. They will literally only give you one tiny small condiment cup of the sauce. Not hardly enough to put on your food."}
{"text":"The food was great.  Service was great.  

They overcharged me on my meal.  I ordered a Brisket Sandwich for $5 and extra meat for $2.75.  I was charged $7.80 for the sandwich and $3 for the extra meat.  I was also charged for a glass of water.

When I mentioned it to the lady as I was leaving, she just took the 'oh well' attitude and told me to have a nice day."}
{"text":"Okay, first let me say the 2 star knockdown has absolutely nothing to do with food...it's soooo good! I have loved or really liked everything I've eaten here, and those pit beans, DELISH! 
I am a former server and bartender, so I'm no stranger to the stresses of the job. While I was waiting for my takeout, a sloppily dressed angry looking woman came from the back,tossed another(not mine) takeout on the counter and walked off without a word. I joked with the ladies up front that if that had been my food, I would have asked to speak to the manager...imagine my surprise when they explained that SHE was the manager!!! And if I'm to be totally honest, I got the distinct impression that this is not uncommon! Nobody gossiped or talked bad about anybody...but like I said, I'm no stranger to this industry. I am adept at reading between the lines. Owners, please address this woman's issues before there is so much drama you lose staff and customers over it, I want to eat there for a long time!
*for clarity, so I don't get the wrong person \"in trouble\", this was on Tuesday and she was wearing a green hoodie."}
{"text":"The five stars are for the green beans alone!!  Try them and see!

C-U/Savoy, please patronize this place!  It is every bit as good as Black Dog.  We like their sauce selection better.  

The lack of crowds any time we are there seems like a bad sign.  This restaurant deserves our support!"}
{"text":"My fellow co-workers and I have lunch here at Smoky House at least twice a month.  The barbecued meats are cooked to a smoky perfection with a variety of sauces on your table for you to choose from. My favorite daily lunch special is the \"burnt ends\" sandwich, which comes with a choice of two sides; I love the steak fries and creamy coleslaw.  While the diner style restaurant has several booths for seating and is generally busy at lunch, we've never had to wait to be seated.  Unlike some of the other reviews, my co-worker and I have never had any thing but courteous prompt service.  I do recommend this restaurant for lunch should you find yourself in Savoy Illinois."}
{"text":"Not sure who taught these  'restauranteurs' the art of BBQ ? This was my second attempt. Not a fan. Dried overcooked brisket. Pulled pork that barely was luke warm. Ribs that tasted like a chemical -- I can only guess it had something to do with the wood they used in the smoker. Our cornbread was do dry it fell apart in a crumby mess. The sauces are  not bad and for commercial potato salad and  slaw they too are ok.   Save your money for Black dog."}
{"text":"By far the best BBQ restaurant in the area!! Definitely recommend you stop by for a bite. Great staff and yet to find something on the menu I didn't like!"}
{"text":"I have to update this review because my family and I actually ate in the restaurant and were very unhappy about the service, which I had read in other reviews prior. They were out of brisket the night we went, there was a bone in the nachos, the nachos were very foul tasting, and the waitress seemed frazzled but also seemed pretty apathetic about it, so she wasn't around much. The best part was that they didn't charge us for the nachos and based on how they were, we decided not to get anything else and left. I won't be eating here again. Not when driving an extra ten minutes gets me to Hickory River or Black Dog."}
{"text":"Food is alright. Smoked pork is good, which is to be expected from a BBQ joint. I'd put it on par with Hickory River's pulled pork. I got the Pony Shoe so maybe that is my problem to begin with, but the choice of steak fries I find interesting and the cheese sauce could be better. Probably will repeat but avoid the shoe next time around."}
{"text":"I ordered a $40 dollar meal and it was delivered with no barbecue sauce. Do not adjust your television set because you read that right. A barbecue place prepared a meal and forgot to include the...barbecue sauce. Their meat contains no rub so their barbecue sauce is pretty important, without it the meat is bland.

After calling the establishment, the guy I spoke with said he would contact Order Up and send some out but it never came. When I called back they were closed. Clearly they just wanted to go home. $40 dollars wasted. 

Mistakes happen and I understand that, but when the establishment does absolutely nothing to fix what happened they show they don't care about their customers.  Worse here is they lied. My food got even colder as I waited for the sauce that never came.

Terrible customer service. Pay a little more and go to Black Dog where they care about your business."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork sandwich with Memphis BBQ sauce. It was great!"}
{"text":"The food is so awesome!! And the peple are great. They were willing to compromise my order when they were out of ribs. I would recommend these guys all day long! Excellent BBQ sauce, ribs, brisket....great job guys!"}
{"text":"This may possibly be my worst dining experience. I've heard terrible things about the service at Smoky's, but I LOVE checking out local restaurants. It'd be nice to have good BBQ you don't have to wait forever for like at Black Dog. A group of 5 of us came and their menu was completely different than what it showed online. Our server was in a sour mood and spoke in a condescending tone when we didn't realize the sauce was on the table as the menu says to ask your server for sauce. My son ordered the kids ribs, they were received cold and dry. When I mentioned it to the server, she was shocked. She couldn't believe it because she said it just came out of the hot box. This was our first and only visit. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Delicious! Just had dinner tonight here. Got the burn ends with corn bread, macaroni and cheese and the pit beans. Macaroni is very creamy, beans great! Cornbread was so good and soft, almost cake like. My burn ends were so good and tender and had a delicious smokey taste, used the memphis sweet bbq sauce. Husband had a half rack of ribs with the bbq fried rice and creamy coleslaw, equally as delicious! We will return again"}
{"text":"I ordered the burnt ends and a 1-2 slab of ribs.  The sides were coleslaw, potato salad, macaroni and cheese and steak fries.  
The fries were limp and greasy, the coleslaw was nothing more than chunks of raw cabbage, the potato salad looked like potato salad but tasted like a bad sweet pickle.  I am almost afraid to try the corn bread.  The  mac and cheese was boiled macaroni tossed in butter or oil, missing was any cheese, cheese sauce or anything that made the macaroni \"and cheese\".  I added salt, pepper, a bit of dijon and shredded cheese.  It helped but it needed a cheese sauce.  
Everything but the bbq sauce was bland, bad or raw.  Yes, RAW!  I took a photo if the bloody ribs and I'll bake them tomorrow.  A $50 order should not have to be salvaged by the customer by adding and cooking.  That defeats the point of restaurants.
There is nothing redeeming about this place.  The food stinks."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential. Sadly I think the location will never let it exceed. The decor was really boring and the open set up made it feel like everybody in the restaurant is watching you. 

The food: Affordable, I ordered the Brisket dinner for 13 dollars. The meal came with 2 sides. The creamy coleslaw was absolutely delicious, but the steak fries were over seasoned for what reason I don't know, sometimes less is more. The brisket was not tender and the portion was small, but the meat was saved by the bbq sauces on the table. My girlfriend had the pulled pork sandwich, she said it was decent for 7 dollars.

Service was quick and friendly so that's always a positive. 

They didn't take my discover card which was annoying, luckily I had a visa on hand.

I would recommend if your in the mood for fast average bbq in between savoy and champaign."}
{"text":"I actually would probably give this 3.5 stars.  For years in CU the place to go for BBQ was Black Dog, which is small and has infinite waits at all meal times.   I think this is in 2nd place, but you can stroll in for a working mans lunch and make it out in a reasonable amount of time.  My wife and I went there and traded lunch plates to try more things.  If you were rating on a 10 point must system (Best in town gets a 10 for you non-boxing fans):

Burnt ends 9
Brisket Sandwich 8
Pit Beans 7
Vinegar/Oil Slaw 10
Steak Fries 7
Corn Bread 10

Food was generally good and plentiful.  The meats were nicely cooked and smoky.  There is a variety of sauces in squeeze bottles on the table so you can spice it to your stomachs content.  Pit beans were a matter of preference.  They were a bit vinegary which were just not  a style I prefer.  Fries were a bit chewy, I thought underdone.

Service was good.  Two lunches with sides and soft drinks about $20."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town!! The wings are amazing--they don't even need to be spun in any sauce. The half chicken, ribs, and pulled pork are soooo good. The loaded fries (with cheese and pulled pork) are phenomenal. Everything we've had there has been great! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Smoky's House BBQ was a delicious lunch without a wait. My husband had the special of the day, pork lion sandwich that came with 2 sides.  He said the meat had a nice smoky flavor, was tender, and made even better with a bit of sauce that you can choose from 5 or 6 at your table. He used a bit of sweet and chipotle mango. He had vinegar slaw and Mac and cheese.  He put the slaw on his sandwich(South Carolina style) and said the Mac and cheese was really good.  I had my favorite, a turkey Rubin sandwich and sweet potato waffle fries.  Both were delicious.  The rye swirl bread along with the slaw and special sauce really made the sandwich special.  
This was not our 1st time at Smoky's and have always had great food but we are surprised it is not more crowded. If you have not tried it please do because we need to keep this good local BBQ restaurant open."}
{"text":"Has a restaurant owner I do not usually like to give bad reviews and this is not a bad review the food was decent the prices are comparable the staff was nice and friendly only complaint is the same with any barbecue plates if you don't keep up with the cleanliness everything was sticky but not filthy good people. Just left I'm leaning more time cleaning"}
{"text":"Located right next door to the movie theater, Smokey's is a good option for a pre-movie meal. They have good brisket and pulled pork, however the burnt ends leave something to be desired (a bit dry and overcooked for my taste). What really stands out is their assortment of bbq sauces. If you're a fan of sauces, you will probably love this place, each one excellent in their own way."}
{"text":"I will try to review this place on its own merits, not in comparison to the other (much better) BBQ Champaign-Urbana has to offer. But let me just say once at the get-go, anyone claiming this place is better than Black Dog is high.

It's decent, average, ok barbecue. It's not bad at all, but it's not great either. 

The meat was relatively dry but they offer plenty of sauces. In other words, don't order brisket (which we all know doesn't take sauce right?!). 

The sides don't taste particularly homemade. But they got the job done.

The sauces seem to get a lot of praise. I agree the sauces were pretty solid and there was decent variety. But you can buy bottles of sauce and eat anywhere. Sauce alone should never inform your entire opinion of a place. Unless it's a sauce store I guess.."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. Especially since they offer delivery (though it comes with a hefty delivery charge) - I love the idea of having an option other than pizza or Chinese delivered to my door. Alas, no matter how often I try Smoky's, I feel disappointed every time. Ribs seem really expensive and don't come sauced, so they're even more awkward and cumbersome to eat than ribs already are. Pit beans have an unappetizing color and texture. Sausage tastes store-bought. Muleshoe doesn't really work with their large steak fries, and is skimpy on the cheese. Even the pecan pie looks and tastes store-bought. I'm afraid this place just can't compete with other options in the area like Lil Porgy's, Black Dog, or even Chili's (for ribs)."}
{"text":"We got some Smoky's House bbq at the Homer Soda Festival. Pulled pork sandwich was delicious - tender pork and soft bread. We liked that there were many sauces with different heat levels to select from. We tried a couple of the spicy ones and they were both tasty. One complaint is that the owner/manager (not sure but he seemed to be in charge) was unpleasant. He kept scolding his staff over absolutely nothing, to the point that some of us customers just looked at each other uncomfortably. I get that it was probably a stressful day, but still."}
{"text":"Delicious and flavorful BBQ on our side of town (Savoy near Schnuck's and Friar Tuck) so let's keep it here. Could use a better selection of cold bottled drinks to wash down the wonderful smokey flavor. Friends had THE most delicious wings which You can get with your choice of sauce or add it yourself.  Love the choices from sweet to hot and hotter. I like the nearly hot... just enough heat for me. Steak fries are worth giving up a side for... counts as 2. Try it... you'll love it."}
{"text":"Ordered a combo for delivery and they called to let me know they were out of ribs but could sub burnt ends. OH YES. Delicious! And the green beans are amazing. Delivery was quick too!  Rock on, Smoky's!"}
{"text":"Having now officially tried every bbq place in the area, I can wholeheartedly say this is my favorite. There isn't even a close second. 

It blows my mind that more people aren't raving about this place. The sauces are far better than the local competition, and the quality of meat (as well as the flavor itself) is superior. 

I'm thankful that my checklist is complete because now I can stop wasting my time at other BBQ restaurants."}
{"text":"This place won't knock your socks off, but by no means is it a bad place to eat. 

I had the brisket sandwich with a side of potato salad and also Mac n cheese. 

The brisket itself, had good shelling and that nice smokey flavor a brisket is suppose to have, however the meat itself was just a bit on the dry side. Nothing a little bit of BBQ sauce can't fix, but there were only 3 sauces to choose from at the table I was seated at.

Potato salad was solid. No complaints here. It wasn't too tangy, but just right. 

The mac n cheese was mostly mac, not much cheese to speak of. I don't know if it's the type of cheese they use, or the amount, but it just felt like they could've added more. 

The food portions, in my opinion, were less than adequate. I am 6' tall, about 165 pounds, and walked out feeling like I could've eaten a lot more. Especially for the price point. Before the tip, my total was about $11. 

All in all I give the food a 3.5/5. The service itself a 5/5."}
{"text":"Great ribs and great service! I ordered a slab for takeout and they were ready in 15 minutes. The staff was friendly and courteous. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is very good- I'll definitely be back.

Had the pulled pork sandwich w/ onion rings."}
{"text":"Sauce Variety is excellent! The pulled Pork was perfectly smoked. I was happy with the wide variety of side choices. Staff was friendly. I normally only go to Black Dog, but this place was a great alternative. I wanted to find something bad about it, but they left me a stuffed and happy camper."}
{"text":"To begin, I enjoy the food.  I used to patron the original location in Charleston and when I moved to Champaign I was thrilled that the owner opened the Savoy location.  I am disappointed that it is more of a \"restaurant\" than a carry out BBQ joint like the original. 
I popped in to carry out lunch,  the service was lacking.  The servers see to avoid the front desk and when I was waited on  it was by an unfriendly fellow. I didn't wait very long for my for my food  to be brought out, which was great. I was in the parking lot when I realized I didn't receive my drink, so I went back in. I had to wait another 5-6 minutes to get someone's attention and get a fountain drink. When I got home to eat, there was no silverware or napkins in the bag.
Again,  the food is delicious but the service is severely lacking."}
{"text":"We had the burnt ends and they were amazing! I think this place is even better than Black Dog in Urbana.  Wide open and casual decor.  Reasonably priced.  Great service.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this after a friend highly recommended it. We are so happy that we did. The beef brisket, pit beans, scalloped potatoes, and homemade corn bread where absolutely delicious! I love that the BBQ sauce is on the table and not the meat. The beef brisket was so good it didn't need any sauce. My husband had the Baby back ribs. There was a lot of meat on the bones and had a really great smoked flavor.  I love sweet tea but the tea was weak and taste like sugar water. I didn't like that the silverware is in a mason jar on the table for everyone to touch. Other than those couple things this place had great service and delicious food. We will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"This is a good, cheap barbecue place.  My husband and I tried it out for lunch.  I had their special for the day, which is Burnt Ends (of a brisket).  Very tender and delish.  You have a choice of sauces at your table, and we tried a few of them and thought they were tasty.  My husband had a pulled pork sandwich, and even though we both liked mine better, his was still pretty good.  The au gratin taters were only so-so, but the cornbread, cole slaw, & applesauce was good.  It's a fun, relaxed atmosphere and for $20 bucks for 2 people, I thought it fit the bill."}
{"text":"Every time I eat Smoky's, I repeatedly catch myself being sort of shocked at how good it is. They really are executing extremely well over there. The pork is smokey, moist, and tender--pulled and not shredded, the buns are tasty, and they nail the hell out of the steak fries, which are salty with a little bit of seasoning, and surprisingly crunchy for a steak fry (I actually enjoy a potato-ey steak fry, too, but these are pretty outstanding). On a past visit I got the burnt ends, which were just as outstanding as burnt ends should be (and they actually were not out of them, like another delicious bbq joint in town usually is!). 

They also deliver. They charged us $1.77, delivered promptly, and the food was just as good as when we ordered in the restaurant. 

I do agree with the other posters that the service leaves a bit to be desired. Everyone encountered has been very nice, but it seems like they need to be whipped into shape a little bit. Servers should be attentive and hustling, whereas the Smoky's servers seem to be relatively ambivalent and very slow. Strangely, having worked in restaurants all throughout highschool and college and grad school, I think that's a simple management attitude problem (I've seen some really good and really bad management, while wait staffs are pretty much always the same--gotta set the bar high and get the basics right!). 

ANYWAY, overall, I would absolutely recommend this place. Huge fan!"}
{"text":"The brisket is divine. The green beans are special and the service is unparalleled. Our new favorite place for bbq."}
{"text":"Some of the best Texas BBQ in the area, and it doesn't have the air of pretentiousness and cramped seating situations you'll encounter at Black Dog. Good prices, great selection of sauces, friendly service, nice decor. Been here a few times, had a good experience with the muleshoe, the ribs, and the burnt end sandwich. I think my favorite side item is the BBQ fried rice."}
{"text":"I ordered the burnt ends and they give you hardly any meat whatsoever and when they say burnt ends they aren't kidding.  I literally could not chew them they burnt so bad.  The two sides I ordered were the Mac and cheese and the creamy slaw.  The Mac and cheese tastes like a box of Kraft and the slaw was very disappointing.  I do not recommend this place to anyone and I will not be back again."}
{"text":"Good brisket,potato salad ,cole slaw,ice tea,good service. What's not to like ? No whining children BONUS"}
{"text":"you guys need to fix your phone order system. I order all the time over the phone and have NEVER had the order right. Ask for Blue cheese --get Ranch. Things like that. Your extra dressings and sauces are poorly labeled with bad penmanship. I work across the street from you guys but this needs to improve. PLEASE! Your food is very good."}
{"text":"Don't let the lemming reviews fool you, Smoky's House does everything better than Black Dog. Literally everything. Beef, pork, chicken, sauce. Hell even the burnt ends, which Black Dog prides themselves on, are much better at Smoky's House. Also consider the fact that the prices are much cheaper, the portions bigger, and the lines shorter it's really a no brainer."}
{"text":"I work near by, so I was excited to see a new restaurant opening up.  (Actually two another is opening next door, just not open yet).  I've eaten there three times already.  At this point I'm not giving up on them, however I might wait a month or so before I return.  I'll give a run through of my three times.

First time in.  Stopped in to Friar Tuck and noted Smokey's was open.  Ordered a chicken sandwich, Memphis sweet and perfect hot, green beans and slaw.  The chicken was good a little smoke and plenty of it.  The Memphis sweet was too sweet for me.  The perfect hot started off too sweet - but had nice after burn - still not my thing, but was impressed since after burn is hard to do.  Green beans seemed like canned, with pork added, (floating in water) - gave them a slight smoky edge - but nothing to write home about.  Slaw seemed like store bought.  Oh, this was take out.

Second time in was disaster.  Ordered take out for a for a friend of mine and myself since we had been moving all day.  Biggest problem was the person taking my order had not been trained and didn't know the menu.  Every question asked was answered with \"I don't know, but I can find out\".  This was true for me and the two other people trying to order take out.  Part of the problem is their menu is overly complicated for a BBQ place, IMHO.  Ordered two meat dinner: pepper turkey and sliced brisket, a smoked sweet potato with meat on the side (that way got to try pulled pork), mac and cheese and slaw again.  They charged me for 2 two meat dinners, kitchen staff caught that and corrected. When my order came I checked it - no sweet potato, no corn bread and no sauces.  OK, same guy from kitchen, fixed it - Even gave extra sauces and an extra sweet potato.  The smoked sweet potato's were a highlight - very good and something you can't get anywhere else.  Brisket was a low point, it looked like it had been cut acrossed the grain wrong and the grain was very thick - good smoke but over all not very good.  Turkey and pork good.  My favorite sauce is the Mango - very complex - good heat.  The Atomic is also good, but be warned it is Atomic.  I like the Hot side so be warned.  Sides still sub-par.  I didn't like the corn bread - it's doughy, however, my friend like it that way.

Third time, got take out brought into work on a Sat.  Once again I got a chicken sandwich with the mango sauce.  Got sweet potato waffle fries to split with coworker.  Lifted the lid on my sandwich and had the \"Where's the beef\" reaction.  Literally 1/3 what I had gotten on trip one - still good just not enough.  The waffle fries could have been good but were so soggy they could not be enjoyed (threw most of them away). Too bad because the dipping sauce was spot on.  We did call this one in and picked it up right away.

In summary, I hope they get it together and make it.  They need to get their staff trained.  I would simplify the menu.  I would love more home make side.  I was hoping for collard greens and slaw like Sea Boat, for example (not a replication of SB, but you know they made it).  Right now I'm in a give them some time and try again mode.  Writing this is in part, hoping they it gets to them and they can make some adjustments.  There are glimmers of hope - the mango sauce is excellent - smoked sweet potatoes amazing.  Just need to get it together and up the sides and consistency!  Please."}
{"text":"Excellent Beef Brisket!  I will go there when I am looking for BBQ (Had a taste of someone else's and was very good reheated in the oven)"}
{"text":"It was such a wonderful night here tonight. We ordered a special big platter for my families and friends to dine in. Oh My God everything was great. And luckily the chief had time to create us a special and free appetizer that was not on the menu. Such a great experience for BBQ lovers. Best BBQ place in town. High recommended!"}
{"text":"I love the wings!  Possibly my favorite wings anywhere.

But the delivery is HORRIBLE.  Slow. Drives are always lost.  They often forget items.  And they NEVER give you napkins.....WITH THOSE WINGS!"}

Yeah for sauce variety as noted by Timothy T. I came here for lunch and had the pulled pork sandwich with 2 sides. The sides of mac and cheese and au gratin tater were okay. Sort of like out of the box which means that they were not that good, but the pulled pork sandwich had a great smokey flavor to it that I doused with a healthy helping of BBQ sauce. I don't remember which one I used but that sauce was amazing. I wanted to actually drink it right up if it was possible. All and all the sauce made up for the lack luster sides. i think i will be back to try the dinner menu and some BBQ ribs as well

Pro: great BBQ sauce, friendly service

Cons: sides were a bit of a let down, sort of from the box experience

Hidden gem:
1. Daily lunch special 7 dollars without drinks + 2 sides vs. 8 dollars with drink. The sandwich changes daily so check the website
2. Daily dinner special as well from 7.5-12 dollars (1/2 slab of ribs) + 2 sides"}
