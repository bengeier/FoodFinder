{"text":"Awful! It was great yrs ago and now it's terrible! Tiny wings and bad service! Rude staff and you can her the kitchen yelling about orders!"}
{"text":"Seriously? Does anybody know what happened here? I get new management/sale but I've been coming here once a month for fifteen years!   Did they seriously fire everyone? I felt like I was I the twilight zone. Just terrible."}
{"text":"I'll give it three stars cause the food is good and we used to go every Sunday for breakfast, sometimes lunch...  Well now that they eliminated the old staff I've gone twice recently and the service is horrible. Waited about 10 minutes to order each time. Just make sure you ask for everything to eat (including silver wear) before your waiter leaves your table.  If you have plenty of time go, if not... McDonald's has better burgers and breakfast.."}
{"text":"We are from Chicago and just moved to the area. We feel at home at Herbs. The staff is fantastic! They are so sweet to our kids and go out of their way to accommodate them. It's been a go to weekly for our family. Thank you to the staff especially Ness who is my three year olds favorite! Oh and the food is great too! Thank you."}
{"text":"Herb's Tavern is a local family-run institution with beer and good burgers that has been around so long, your grandma probably ate there.  It's also the kind of place you can go eat with your grandma and your parents without feeling completely fogeyed out, maybe just partially.  As someone else said, it looks upscale from the outside, but it's not.    The atmosphere is historic, friendly and homey - it's got all the colonial dark wood innards you'd expect from seeing its old-fashioned outards.  It is quite small inside, and when full of people plus a game blasting on the TV you cannot make dinner conversation easily, so you may want to look to see how crowded the parking lot is before deciding to stop in.  There is table service so you don't have to order at the bar and schlep your own food around.   Like many \"bars that serve food\", Herb's has a variety of stuff on the menu but I recommend sticking to the tried-and-true standbys like a nice greasy burger with toppings of your choice (may not be terribly fresh - the 'shrooms come from a can), or the \"Giant Hot Dog\" on a nicely toasted bun.  The french fries are crispy, but seem  baked rather than actually fried in oil. At least they do not seem to be microwaved.   The beer selection is ordinary and focuses on brand name beers like Miller, Heineken, Corona etc. The closest thing to geek beers are a couple Great Lakes selections and maybe a seasonal or two.    Overall, I wouldn't come here expecting anything exotic or cutting-edge in the food and drink line, but if you want to hang out with your friends or family over a burger and beer, this is a good old standby."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The burgers are basic, but good-every time.  Why try anywhere else when all I really wanted was a burger and a beer."}
{"text":"Love Herbs!  Pub food with local atmosphere.   Nice people, cold beer with good burgers!  That's a win in my book!"}
{"text":"First let me state that I have been coming to Herb's since moving here in1980 (when I was 6 years old). All the locals come here for a burger and a beer, and although we eat healthy and organic food at home, we are still known to patron Herb's when feeling like a ... burger and a beer. Tonight after sitting down in a pretty much empty restaurant, I looked around and knew something was off. I made a statement to my husband that all of the waitstaff were different. No familiar faces whatsoever. He said he had heard that management had changed. Hmmmm....a quick peek in the kitchen and they too were strangers to me- and they are all wearing plaid shorts as part of their new uniform. We all ordered our usuals. Uh the french fries- all hard and greasy and tasted of fish, bacon, chicken... Not good. No ketchup on the tables anymore, whaaaat?! Thanks for the thimble full could I have about 6 more? The service was attentive and they were quick to refill our drinks. The food- is probably the same but it's not cooked the same. I'm not going back. It's different. Too different. It was never a restaurant I couldn't live without, but would have always gone too because it's a part of me and my history. I bring my kids here because I went when I was their age. However, we are not going back. The crowd was gone, the familiar faces are gone, the ketchup was gone. It feels too different. It's too bad- Herb's is gone."}
{"text":"Just in Rocky River for a family member illness. Happened into Herb's. This is my kind of place. Feels like hometown bar out-of-town. Thanks Justin for making us feel like \"Norm\"! Had lunch. Perfectly wonderful."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife and 2 year old for lunch. This is a local spot with great service and food!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Herb's for years and have always enjoyed food, service and atmosphere.  True, it's not a 5-star experience but it's a wonderful hometown treasure. I've never shared a negative review but our experience on Monday, May 5 left a lot to be desired. Service was poor and the food wasn't much better.    The bartender was talking to another customer at the bar when she approached us for our dinner order.   When my boyfriend ordered his meal she said \"Whoa!  All I heard was mumbles!\" (she really said that!).  Yipes.   She checked back with us about halfway through our meal.  My sandwich wasn't prepared as the menu stated and she said she'd take care of it.  I didn't want her to make a big deal but she yelled through the hole (Herb's customers know what that is) to tell the cook what he'd done.  We didn't order a round but she brought us opened beers which we felt obligated to accept.   We heard about the specials when we were cashing out.  Too bad because we would've ordered tacos.     The bartender's constant talking was really distracting.  She was very loud.  She talked at length about the changes coming to Herb's.  Sure, Herb's could use a facelift but  her comments about the restaurant were unprofessional.  She said that she is working with Kim and Herb (she said he's in an Assisted Living but \"not locked down\") to make Herb's really good.   She said that the restaurant is dirty and disheveled and needs a good cleaning (they'll be closed May 19-21 for cleaning).  She also told customers that the service was very poor and that the servers have been replaced with a new staff.  She said that she would be training new staff and that she'd worked with the George family for many years and opened Town Hall but she wanted out of the nightclub business.  If the service that she provided was any indication of the service patrons will receive in the future prepare to be disappointed.  And prepare to wait to be served.  The customers next to us commented that they had not been able to place their order.    It's a shame we won't be seeing Mary, Stella, Rachel and the other staff any longer.  They were part of the charm of Herb's ~ they knew what you wanted when you came in and they made you feel at home.  Good luck to the new Herb's.  Maybe with once the restaurant is clean and the new staff is trained Herb's will find whatever it is you're striving to become.  Too bad, though ~ Herb's was already a great Rocky River destination."}
{"text":"I'm mad at Herb's... there aren't many places of character in the area and this little place has SO MUCH potential!! But, instead of being a little different than the other joints, it's just more of the same, even worse. I had a meal there with family, 3 sandwiches, couple beers, some fries (extra!), ended up with a $70 bill + tip.... all the food we were served was most likely coming from the freezer, either from Cisco or some other mega brands serving restaurants... wings, fries, the fish in the fish sandwich, the black bean burger, etc... everything we were served I'm pretty sure comes from some frozen brand, and sold for a huge premium!  It's really too bad, because this place has all the attributes to become a gem! The location, is excellent, has character, has a parking, etc... They need to revamp it, loose the old 70's look, hire 'real' cooks who are good at doing HOMEMADE fares, for a descent price and this place will explode... guarantee! Burgers & wings are fine for bar food, but at least, make it fresh, appetizing, buy quality products if you wanna sell it as such!"}
{"text":"UH!!! I got sucked in again by somebody to go here again. I pleaded not to go here.I was shot down.The food still sucks here.It really does. I still can't believe they are still open and/or serving the same food.   I will tell you one thing & I challenge you.  Get one of these extra/loaded burgers with any crap you want to put on.Then get a triple or a double burger from \"Steak n Shake\" & eat both. You only pay $3.49 for the triple at Steak n Shake with everything on it compared to $6-7-8 to \"ERBS\" BURGER.   Remember no need to ask for extra grease on the burger. It already comes with it=soaked !!"}
{"text":"Cheap prices, get down to business servers & good food. The End...."}
{"text":"Would not come back again. The burger I got was average and blah, also ordered a side of fries and they were gross! Seemed freezer burned. They may have low prices but save your money"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my parents one Friday, and it was good. But nothing to write home about. I ordered an iced-tea, but ended up switching it with my mom for her Coke because it was too sweet for her. I ordered the crab cake sandwich, which I assumed came with fries (like most sandwiches at most restaurants), but it did not. It actually ended up being a good thing because I ate some of my parents' fries with their orders, and it was just the right amount of food. It took a little while to get our orders out, and someone who came in after us (they had 2 people, we had 3 at our table - not sure if that made a difference), got their food before us. And my mom got locked in one of the stalls in the women's bathroom, and I had to go rescue her - so you should check on fixing that stall, if you have not already."}
{"text":"Unbelievably poor service!! Really? Bar maid seats herself next to me (with a magazine) at the bar on Sat at 11:30 am to have breakfast when NO ONE was able to take  my order? Told to wait for \"the change over from breakfast \" yet the customer next to me had a burger?!!!  Gets even better. As unprofessional and absurd as it began it ended even more unacceptable. The \"server\" eating her meal next to me never acknowledged my presence and eventually some unnamed server took my order making me feel unwelcome to say the least. 1/2 hr after ordering with no apologies I received my burger..w/out my fries (which the server had to be reminded I ordered) and no kindness or apology on anyone's part. I left my food and drink but paid the $17 tab. If the self centered woman sitting next to me is the owner  then get a grip. Too many good restaurants around today. Your new patio tables w/out umbrellas is just another indication of your lack of respect for your customers. It's a new economy. You need to cater to your clientele. Believe me NO ONE who owns a restaurant lets their employees take a break and eat at the bar while their paying customers sit twiddling their thumbs waiting for food. Cleanliness was also an issue when I saw my \"server\" help bring in wine on a side door adjacent to the bar then  continue his duties without washing his hands.? Think before you eat here.."}
{"text":"I've seen birds on the patio not eat the food people threw off their plate..less then 1 star."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burgers and fries anywhere in the area. We stopped in for lunch. The atmosphere is great. Casual and welcoming. The service was great. Our burgers were simple, flavorful, and the quality of the beef was obvious. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Really do not get the negative comments ... at all . Went to Herb's on Dec. 31 for lunch .... was packed .... got fairly prompt service despite the crowd ... in no time at all received our Herb-Burgers , mushrooms ,chili ...... juicy & tasty as always ......... calling this place a ''dive'' ? its in upscale Rocky River ... its very cozy-clean restrooms-- good service-- fair prices..... very much enjoyed this iconic burger palace and will look forward to returning ."}
{"text":"Basic bar food for twice the price of what it should be. Could have had a great dinner at any number of local establishments in the area for what we spent for two appetizers. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Patio not busy, random Tuesday night. First I got the wrong drink, waited 15 minutes for the ordered  glass of wine. Wrong sandwich, waited 15 minutes for correct sandwich (specified on order) while my eating partner had finished. Asked me if I wanted in a take out container. No discount, only a verbal \"sorry\". Poor service all around."}
{"text":"I recently went to Herb's. Now mind you I am not a \"regular\" by any means but the only thing different was the staff. The food is the same. The Herb Burger still fills the need for a burger so wrong it's right and the wings are classic. I found the staff to be friendly and attentive; even asking what the people at the bar wanted to watch. Herb's is still a Rocky River staple.  The regulars who were there were rude and cold to the new staff which was a bit appalling. Come on everyone, the staff is just doing their job. No need to take out your problem with the changes on them!"}
{"text":"For at least the last 15 years I have been coming here with my family. When I was in my 20's I used to grab a good friend, and meet my mom and dad here for wings and burgers. My dad for our birthday's let us choose ANYWHERE we wanted the family to eat, and we found ourselves more and more coming here. It is a bar, so is it not the fanciest, spaciest( is that a word? LOL) .. place, but you don't think about that when you are sitting here eating jalapeno cheese fries, pepper jack cheese burgers, and wings... This is bar food, for sure... but GREAT bar food.   The parking lot is a little small, but there is parking next door in the shopping center, or across the street.. but be sure NOT to park where they say NO PARKING.   I have to think this place gets its business from word of mouth advertising... and I know that since I moved away from Ohio, that my parents still meet up there with their friends.... We even met up when I was visiting here a few months back. all 14 of us! GREAT TIME.   It is crazy when its busy, and and can quite loud.. but that is what makes this place fun... Dont' be afraid to bring the kids.. but don't be surprised to see happily drunken softball teams hanging out... so be prepared... but not deterred!!"}
{"text":"A great, standard burgers-and-booze kind of place for when you don't want to just go to a dive bar.    Their main item, the Herb Burger, is quality meat cooked medium-rare (to you people that like well-done burgers--What is wrong with you???) and topped with mushrooms and grilled onions; you can add virtually anything you want for a few extra cents/dollars from a long list on their menu.  It's one of the tastiest burgers I've had in a while and I look forward to going back.  Their menu doesn't have much beyond standard bar fare, but a lot of selections within that category (reubans, club sandwiches, various fried appetizers), and from what I've tried they seem to do it well.  Beer was reasonably priced and they had a fair amount of good choices on tap (Guinness, Blue Moon, Molson, etc.) which puts them above a lot of hole-in-the-wall places that just have Bud Light or something."}
{"text":"Cute little piece of Rocky river. Burgers are fantastic nice and juicy and very large. We've also got it late night for some drinks and had a blast. Staff has always been very friendly."}
{"text":"As a child growing up, this was one of my favorite burger joints.  I bragged to my wife that we \"had\" to stop here and eat lunch.  Atmosphere was great, service was decent, food quality was box food (so disappointed) serving size was underwhelming, and the prices did not match the value received.  We dine out about ten (10) times per week.  Sorry Herb's, you've fallen off our radar."}
{"text":"Local tavern. From the front, I thought it was more high end. Oh, so wrong.   Beer selection is highly safe. Nothing edgy or fun. I settled on a Dortmunder draft, as that was the best I could find.   Someone at our table ordered nachos, figuring it would be a good item to share. Tortilla chips covered in canned, cubed tomatoes, black olives, and tasteless hot peppers. All smothered in warm \"cheese\". You know...cheese with a Z. The gross stuff sold in cans at the grocery store.   I can see why there are mixed reviews. This place is definitely a local dive bar. If you grew up here, I can see the love. In fact, I have a few places like this I know and love. No love affair here yet. :-)"}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't go here sooner. Now it's a regular place for me and my wife. Great burgers and great value. It's always a good meal. I've not been there later in the evening when I guess it gets busier. I usually go there around 7 or 8 when there are just a few diners there. So the service is great around that time. I highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"A few friends and I ordered food from here through UberEATS, so I can't actually comment on the place itself. I can say though that we were disappointed in the food. Two of us ordered omelettes, and it was not what we were expecting. It was very bland and we wanted to add our own things in order to give it flavor. The only plus side was our side of bacon. The third person ordered an Irish wrap, which she said was delicious. The only issue she had was that the sausage she ordered on the side was extremely \"slimy.\" Overall, as much as we all wanted to like the food, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"The owner is top notch. The order was delayed and she comped us. A classic place with people of integrity. I highly recommend. Good food also!"}
{"text":"When somewhere is listed as having one of the top burgers in Cleveland I'm going to try it, and I'm going to have high expectations. This did not come close to meeting them. Canned mushrooms on top of a just ok burger with frozen fries. I was very confused.  Herb's must have a great marketing strategist...  With that said, the service was nice, they have a nice patio, but I can't muster more than those two stars because the expectations were so high."}
{"text":"After reading some reviews below it seems they were going under some transition into management a while back, but this was my first time there, ever, so I am going off the wonderful experience I had!   My friend and I went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and a few drinks.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive (not overly attentive) and extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  We warned him this was our firs time and welcomed his recommendations, and I will say he didn't steer us wrong!  For appetizers we ordered pot roast pirogi's and pepper jack cheese bites.  To start, these pirogi's were out of this world! The waiter mentioned they get them homemade in Lakewood and they brought their own pot roast to her to get them made, honestly I could of made a meal out of them!  The cheese bites were just eh - I don't think I would order them again, not that they were bad, but definitely seem frozen and basic, especially next to our other appetizer.    As is common knowledge and the waiter recommended, they are known for their burgers.  I found a lot on the menu that I wanted to try but figured I had to go for their specialty.  I ordered the Herb's Burger, a 1/3 lb patty with mushrooms, onions, then added lettuce and tomato.  The meat was cooked as I ordered, medium, very juicy, and could tell they were homemade by the shape (a little pork chop looking).  It was a little messy to eat, but burgers usually are.  I really enjoyed it and would definitely go back!  For a bar/diner type place I was very surprised that the sides do not come with the meals, kind of disappointed by that but since we ordered appetizers we were okay.    From my conversations I had heard the onion rings are worth trying, so if you are looking to add a side, I'll pass along the recommendation that was given to me.  I will say I will definitely be back.  I love the small town bar feel especially for a quick meal or afternoon lunch!   P.S. I was informed as we left its $10 domestic buckets - I'll take a $2 Bud Light anyday :)"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed.  The prices were very high for what you get....every salad was over $9 (and they were nothing special), the sandwiches all at least $7 and most around $9 (and everything costs extra...want some onion?  0.55, please.)  The fries (if you asked for and paid extra for) were frozen crinkle-cuts.  I asked for them to leave the mayo off on my sandwich and bring me some horseradish on the side.  It came with mayo on it, no horseradish, which the waitress had to be reminded to go get and I slopped on top of the mayo.  My wife ordered soup (chicken noodle) and sandwich.  The soup was definitely out of a can, and not a great brand, even.  About the only good thing I can say was that everyone was very friendly and attentive.  But there weren't many people there (Fall, Monday 630pm)"}
{"text":"Quaint is the right word for this place. It has a tavern-feel, but the food wasn't anything to rave about. We had a random fried appitizer that was just OK, and we both got burgers for dinner. The burgers were good, but they come ala cart ... fries, onion rings, etc are all seperate.  Prices were fairly low which was good!"}
{"text":"New ownership! Top notch pub grub with a large menu.  Service was excellent for both visits.  Everyone more than friendly. Breakfast was hearty and lunch menu had choices to please everyone from carnivore to vegan. Friendly crowd with plenty of televisions for sports."}
{"text":"Great food good service Bloody Mary's! !  !  Great food prices ok. Not too busy so no waiting"}
{"text":"Went here with my dad, to visit the home of the Herb burger, which my dad has talked about for my entire life and I've never tried. So first off, the place is interesting, has some definite style. I can understand why my dad likes it - a lot of wood and various knickknacks all over that are intresesting and give an old school feel. Started with a summer shandy, perfect for a warm summer day. Went with a Herb burger with cheese and bacon. Wasn't terribly big, but decent burger. The fries weren't super crispy, but were good. This place is good for the decor and to chill with a decent burger for a decent price"}
{"text":"The way the mushrooms and grilled onion combined with the greasy one-half pound patty make Herb's a good place for a \"guilty pleasure\" burger.  Sure, the bun is nothing special, and the square patty is reminiscent of Wendy's (and maybe only a notch or two above it in quality at that).  The burger at Johnny's Little Bar is probably bigger, and this is not the place for those desiring a more topping-driven experience like B Spot.  But Herb's does deliver a pretty satisfying burger amid homey and comfortable surroundings."}
{"text":"Went for a bike ride around Rocky River looking for a good place to eat when a couple told us about Herb's Tavern. It's a cute little place with a nice patio to sit out on during the summer. My friend and I both got cheeseburgers and split a side of fries. The burgers were nothing special, but I think that simplicity is what made them perfect; sometimes you just need a good greasy burger. The fries were okay, but they really need to change the name of them as they are currently on the menu as \"Freedom Fries\" which instantly made me cringe when I read it."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for a beer and a burger. A no frills kind of place, but what they do, they do well. Find a table in one of the two dining rooms, or settle in at the bar and let bartender Dan take care of you... and if you order a Stroh's from him, he'll probably give you one on the house."}
{"text":"Burgers are good, but it's the weekends-only breakfast that rocks.  My family of 5 comes here almost every Sat morning.  The omelets, pancakes, sausage, hash browns, and all the basics are seriously the best in town.  We've tried many, many other places, but we always come back here.  The service is awesome and your food comes out super fast.  Herb recently turned it over to his daughter who made some changes, but the breakfast cooks are thankfully the same and still make their awesome dishes.  If you're foodies like us that like fast, awesome, no nonsense breakfast at a great price, this'll be your go-to place."}
{"text":"There is just something special about a locally owned restaurant that has been around for years.  The food is great and the atmosphere/energy is what makes Herb's Tavern our favorite places to eat.  My family and I go there to see friends and enjoy great food!"}
{"text":"Great food, great patio, awesome kid's menu...and great live music....food was home made and really good.  The staff were excellent and really nice....will stop here again for sure."}
{"text":"It's just a great regular neighborhood joint. It's not supposed to be five stars and that's why I'm giving them 5.  They're great at what they do.  Ps you won't see it on the menu but ask them about the homemade pot roast pierogis.  THEY ARE INCREDIBLE!!!"}
{"text":"I have always liked this place to watch games. The patio is nice for people and car watching when it is warm outside. The food is alright - nothing fancy but it is also very affordable.  This place seems to be liked by locals. People come in with kids, groups of people, people who want to hang out at the (cool shaped) bar.  The staff is very nice and special requests have been catered to with a smile! Keep up the good work in a friendly, inviting local hang out."}
{"text":"This place has been a staple of memories for our family for over a half of a century...We have celebrated weddings, kids, deaths, over those chairs/booths/burgers forever.  The emotions embroiled in that building are huge...Burgers are great, the whole fried appetizer thing is a family must do..."}
{"text":"Herb's is a great place that I have been going to for years.  I am surprised to be the first review they are receiving.  I love their burgers, and 95% of the time that is what I get.  They have great fries and you can get cheese sauce either all over your fries or on the side.  I can honestly say I have never had a bad meal here.    The service also has never let me down.  My husband and I generally sit in the same section every time, and Mary is generally our waitress.  She remembers what beverages we like and generally seems happy to see us and always makes us feel welcome.    Herb's is first and foremost a Tavern, so during sporting events and on weekends the place is packed.  I do generally avoid going during these times because it just is not my scene.  If it is your scene though, I know Herb's offers different beer specials which seem to change regularly."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem for a solid brunch. My girlfriends that are Lakewood natives recommended Herb's when we were trying to figure out a brunch destination. The interior is quaint and was seat yourself which is always appreciated. We were greeted immediately and quickly after sitting a drink order was taken.  In my opinion there were many options on their breakfast/brunch menu. I indulged in a blood orange mimosa, and would've had many more had I not had my daughter with me. To order, for the little lady I got the standard scrambled eggs, wheat toast, home fries, and a side of bacon. I had to try the home fries, because they looked delish, and they were exactly that. I ordered my standard of avocado toast, I think I order it where it's available. And true to my standard, chat with our server about my dairy restriction. He stepped away to confirm with the kitchen that it would be do able, and they switched the poached egg to a scrambled so they would be able to cook it without butter. I loved the avo toast! THE AVOCADO WAS PERFECTO! All in all I would definitely hit up Herb's again for brunch!"}
{"text":"I love it here. It's got so much nostalgic value and it has great food. The staff is always so happy and friendly. I definitely suggest the herb burger, the chili, or pretty much anything."}
{"text":"We went for dinner Friday  night. Within min I was sick. The burger tasted sour....almost a hospital  visit for me. My husband  asked for his burger med rare it arrived well done. I would avoid this place."}
{"text":"This place is walkable from my house, and therefore gets fairly regular visits. They make above-average wings, but everything else - including the vaunted burger - is pretty standard. They do fried stuff well, as do many bars in this town. Servers can be surly but they're always prompt and professional. If a was in a less-forgiving mood, I'd dock a star over the ridiculous \"freedom fries\" on the menu. I thought/hoped that brand of vapid jingoism got thrown out with W. It's frankly embarrassing to see it on a menu and it never fails to make me wince."}
{"text":"The food was good and the prices were decent as well.  We came for breakfast with Santa and that was a mistake. I appreciate restaurants doing this for kids but not if it's going to be this much of a nightmare.   Our party of 8 was jammed into a corner at a 4 top table. The manager was rude when we asked about adding another small table so we could actually fit our food on it.   Then as soon as our last bite of food was finished we were being pushed out to accommodate another party that has been watching us eat every single bite of food from 3 feet away."}
{"text":"Quaint, family owned business with fantastic burgers and decent beer selection. Good for lunch, fairly limited menu for dinner."}
{"text":"There was for a time a transition from old management to the daughter who owns it now. In that time the food was awful. Burgers were dryer than ever, and the servers were off their game. I was very Leary to return when I saw how bad it had gotten. That being said I have since been back and the transition period seems to have ended and they seem to be back to almost where they used to be.   The food is your basic burgers and other comfy style food that you just crave sometimes. As a side note I've recently figured out that you may get a \"double\" if you ask and the way they charge it is totally worth it in my opinion. (Recently they have changed the buns they use with their burgers so that they absorb the water from the onions and mushrooms. If the turn away factor was that the buns were soggy, this issue is no longer present in the burgers)  Finally let's get to the staff. They are just the kind of people you know and want to talk to. They are how I learned of the turmoil within the staff and bosses. You just wanna talk to them because they are servers, but also people you just wanna treat like local friends.  I will be adding it back to my list along with flip-side if I just want a simple burger over the amazing forester at flip-side"}
{"text":"The homemade shepherds pie was to die for! The bartender was one of the most friendly bartenders i have experienced. Definitely will be returning!!"}
{"text":"It's a fine restaurant, but there is nothing special about it. No signature dish, no particularly cheap food or drinks. It's just okay. I can see coming here because of the patio bar, but their lack of summer beers on tap doesn't really make it a high point.   I had the cheesy bacon fries and a club sandwich. The cheese is like nacho cheese, the canned stuff. The sandwich was good. Had a few beers. Very meh place."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Herb's for years and years, and I love it. The service isn't amazing. They're all friendly but not necessarily always attentive, but it's super easy to flag one down because of the small space this place is. I always order the same thing and I am never unhappy: the Giant Hot Dog. My best friend and I always get two buns and that way we can cut it in half and make two hot dogs of it. They're always plump and juicy and the buns are grilled to perfection. The fries are yummy too, crinkley and have a lot of potato to them. I have also had their burgers and have enjoyed them immensely.   The place is a bit over-priced I'd say, but I have to admit when I was a regular I was a high school student on a tight budget, I'd probably say that if I went back now it'd be fine.   This is a great place to kick back and relax with friends on any given evening."}
{"text":"Delicious Burgers. Great food and atmosphere. Low prices. A great place for a beer and burger with friends."}
{"text":"We were sooooo disappointed in the burgers. $8 for the equivalent of a Wendy's burger...and nothing with it. \"Fries come with during the Browns game\"...we were there early in the 4th quarter it just took forever to get the order taken. $6 extra for a basket of fries! The Patty Melt was terrible. The Club sandwich came without turkey and had to be remade.  That said, the Rubens were good, and the fish fry looked good. We are in no hurry to go back."}
{"text":"I will preface this by saying we ordered from this restaurant through uber eats.  This has been the worst restaurant I've ever ordered online from. I ordered a simple hamburger and the bun was soaking wet. The burger was overcooked and had mild peppers with stems left on it. My wife ordered a corn beef sandwich which also was disgusting.  I never write reviews on restaurant but i need to send a warning to everyone else to NOT EAT AT THIS RESTURANT."}
{"text":"Well, this place has really changed over the years.  I am so disappointed with it now. Seems like there is new staff every time I've been there.  Why?   Also, I think even the cook staff has changed or else the recipes have.  Crab bisque tasted very tomatoey without any crab taste at all.  They used to have such good soups too.  The wings were different too.  Just a little off...maybe too well done. There on tap beer choices are not very good either.  It is now ungodly expensive too. A cheap-ass Yingling is $4  for a pint! This is not a place you can hang out with a friend and expect good food and maybe a couple of decently priced beer on tap.    It was nice having a cool, off-the-beaten path place to go to.   With so much competition and every other new bar being a trendy expensive place... why hasn't anyone figured out how to be a neighborhood bar?"}
{"text":"I got Herb's from Uber Eats. This might not be the most accurate review. Soggy toast, dry omelet, good pancakes, forgot my jelly. I'd give them another shot in house, but never Uber Eats with them again."}
{"text":"We hit a local consignment shop who recommended Herb's Tavern said it was the best service ever and the food was good. The owner clearly was the owner - very polished and inclusive of everyone. Huge kudos to give us a free appetizer to try - fried cheese. How can that be bad? Never. Loved it.   The wings were wet and good. The super duper hot sauce (forget the name) wasn't that hot but that's not them that's our tough taste buds. Wine was good. Beer was ok. The downside was the Hodge Podge - an appetizer that is $14.95 of fried mushrooms, cauliflower, onion rings and fries. Awesome amount but the shrooms were over done, barely any cauliflower and was just not worth the $14.95. LOVE shrooms and barely had any of them as well.   Wasn't bad as again, the owner was a bright spot but we've had better. Thank you!"}
{"text":"the food here is obviously either prepared in advance or frozen because that is what it tasted like. Won't come back here."}
