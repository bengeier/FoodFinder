{"text":"Can't believe we haven't checked out such a great place yet! Jaclyn was phenomenal! Really sweet, perfect timing and great knowledge of the menu!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I love the dog friendly patio and the food is consistently wonderful! We love the various wines (especially the peach sangria, yum!) and the atmosphere. Our dog is happy there too as they always bring him a water bowl. You don't feel rushed when you come here but try to make reservations if you decide to come at night. A true gem here in Phoenix! The only tip for improvement that I have to offer to to make the bruschetta bread a bit softer as it can be difficult to chew."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood restaurant with great food and excellent deserts especially the bread pudding. Great discreet brunch. Recommend everything, especially the flights of mimosas. Client meeting, Great salads, Great bottle of Wine, Flavor was nothing short of yummy."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had brunch there last Sunday out on the patio. The waitress was great, the food was good but the patio was so dirty I couldn't stop wanting to power wash the whole place. They have the biggest, shadiest patio with misters!  This place should be packed every weekend. Come on... Just clean it up a bit!! Trim the dead branches. Plant some cool flowers. It wouldn't be that big of an expense. They are waiting in line at postinos down the street."}
{"text":"We just had a wedding at Timo with about 90 people attending. The food was fantastic and the service was out of this world. Our guests were greeted with delicious appetizers and champagne. The food received rave reviews and we danced on the patio until midnight. I cannot say enough good things about the service, food and atmosphere. It made it a worry free, fun, magical night for us."}
{"text":"Phoenix has great restaurants, and here is another  I just discovered in my travels.  Their corn bread is the best, big logs of cheesy corn bread warm from oven will not disappoint. Roasted butternut salad was perfect blend of greens, squash, seeds and dried fruit.  And the pizza Bianca had the most tender crust I've ever eaten.  Nice atmosphere. Will come again."}
{"text":"Timo Wine Bar is the best place to go anywhere near Central Ave -- and anywhere north of Camelback! It's so amazing... top-notch cocktails and wine... pizza that rivals Phoenix's other bests (there are many!)... and appetizers and other food that are beyond bread...

The first time I came here my party ordered the Tiramisu and it came in a wine glass! So delicious!!!

Probably my favorite part about Timo Wine Bar is the eloquent and highly talented staff. They have great ideas, such as contests, cocktails, and they keep the clientele both staying and coming back daily! This is more than just a \"friendly place\" -- it's truly a home for many, many people."}
{"text":"So was able to join Timo for a birthday party on the back patio.  The patio is wonderful once the sun goes down.  There is a great fire pit as well as some great back lighting.  The service was very friendly as they dealt with the hustle and bustle of a private event.

I like the over all feel of the place.  Very intimate inside as you can watch the cooks throw the flatbread into the wood fired oven.  The beer selection had a decent variety on NON-Anheuser Busch that plagues most restaurants, but would preferably like to see a couple other AZ breweries represented.  Luckily Four Peaks Hop Knot got me through the evening.

Ordered the Shortrib flatbread and later a Bruchetta plate that came out with three varieties.  The Shortrib was very appetizing with an accent of banana peppers. The Tomato was good as well as the Fig, but the Copa could use either a different supplier or switched to a Prosciutto...wasn't my favorite.

Overall we had a good evening and our friend enjoyed himself.  Only little tweaks were the bar ran out of some items, which proved the items were good I guess, and some of the drinks cocktails could have been a little stronger for the price.

All in all, it looks like a good addition to the North Phoenix"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The sangria is delicious! You defiantly should try the cheese of the day, I usually dont like cheese but theirs is to die for! I love the decor and how you can actually see them cook food on the wood fire oven! Great spot to kick back and relax! I love it! Also if you like champagne defiantly try the mimosa flight for brunch! Yum!"}
{"text":"We meet up with another couple there on a beautiful Sunday night and it was so fun! The patio was lovely, the server was great and the food was good!  We had the hummus board and it was so good. The wood oven bread with the honey citrus butter was divine.  I had the Timo Shellfish trio and it was good. The sriracha shrimp and the scallops were nice but the citrus ceviche was disappointing. My friend let me have a bite of her crab cake benedict and that is what i am having next time! IT WAS SO DELICIOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! Nathan is absolutely amazing! Next time I come I'm definitely having a party on the patio with the fire pit. The beverages are awesome also. Be sure to come check it out!"}
{"text":"Went here a few months ago with my girlfriend and I've been meaning to write a review.

Ordered:
Brussel sprouts salad
Bruchetta
Tomato soup

Drink:
Oscar blues little yellow pils

Dessert:
Peach cobbler

The atmosphere of the place was great. We went during restaurant week but a little later in the night so things weren't too crazy. Seemed like a good place to go with a group of friends or a date and just enjoy a night out.

Service was also fantastic. The waitress was attentive and walked us through the menu.

The salad was easily the best part of the meal. Brussel sprouts with bacon and a mustard dressing. Delicious and unlike anything I've ever had before. 

Bruchetta and soup were nothing special but they were tasty and filled out the meal nicely.

The cobbler was also fantastic. Made to order and served with a scoop of ice cream. The crust was crumbly, buttery and delicious. The waitress suggested it and I could not thank her enough. Great way to end the meal and our night.

I will likely go back again. Plenty of food and drink left to try"}
{"text":"love the food here, great wine selection, the bartender was very helpful. told us to come back for brunch which sounds great Thanks Amy. She even served our lunch one day when it was slow."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Timo Wine Bar. We were seated right away at the fire pit, but took a while to get our drinks. They were super busy, as everyone was out enjoying the weather. I have to say that the wait was worth it. We got the Sunday special, bottle of wine & eggplant lasagna...so good and I'm not a big fan of eggplant. The manager gave us a peach cobbler due to the long wait, also super tasty. They have an awesome patio and looking forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"We came here last night, Cinco de Mayo for dinner.  It was my first time.  Lynne had been here before. We  arrived about 7ish and it was empty.  Well whenever I arrive at a restaurant around dinner time and it is empty, I get pretty nervous thinking..what does everyone else know about this place that I don't!  The service was even pretty slow to be initially greeted outside after being seated.  Apparently they were having a major computer system challenge.  How ever once we were greeted by our server, it was all AMAZING from that point on.....
As I mentioned, Lynne had been here before and really liked it.  When I told her my thoughts she offered to go somewhere else.  I simply said that we were here now, let's stay so we know whether we will come back again or not!  We sat outside on the patio and it was amazingly beautiful! 
Michelle was our server. She had such a warm, personable service oriented attitude. 
I had the cedar plank salmon and Lynne had the wood fire roasted chicken.  They were both OFF THE CHAIN, cooked PERFECTLY!  I was very pleasantly surprised how great the food was and that was topped off by superb service and a wonderful ambiance outside.  We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Timo is quaint with modern, industrial decor. The patio is also a wonderful place to unwind and with enough shade from all of the trees, it's the perfect place to enjoy happy hour with your well-behaved pup. Oh and they treat your furry pals like guests instead of with the usual disdain some places have. 

Sunday night lasagna and wine deal is a steal and addicting. I actually get cravings for that lasagna, definitely one of the best in the city. A huge portion full of veggie goodness, its the perfect plate to share with your vegetarian date and carnivores won't feel like they are missing out because it's that satisfying. It's the perfect way to end the Sunday Funday festivities. 

Then there's the chicken Cesar kale salad... It seems like kale salad has become every restaurants trendy new item, but this one really takes the cake, or salad ;). Not only is the kale carefully baked to perfection, it comes with more than an adequate amount of fresh parmesan, and the grilled seasoned chicken is a taste explosion that makes you want to denounce every other Cesar salad in existence.  Seriously, it's that good. 

Though the staff is knowledgeable and pleasant, some go over and beyond for great service. The bartender, Amy, always suggests the best meal or cocktail for the occasion and is willing to create whatever concoction you want. Not only is she atop of her craft, but she really treats her customers with utmost care, always making sure every experience is first-rate. 

If it's not apparent by now, Timo is one of my favorite places in Northern Phoenix. If you're in the area, its definitely worth a try. It's a culinary experience that's not going to break the wallet, an easy place to pass the time and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Staying at a nearby resort , used yelp, thank you yelp! and found this place. Wonderful atmosphere and the food was truly delicious.   They didn't have  any reservations available so we walked in and got seated shortly thereafter.    A fabulous discovery, if you're visiting Phoenix as we were and looking for a nice indoor/outdoor place with atmosphere and top notch food , this one hits the mark!!   My husband wants me to say that it's the best lasagna  sausage he ever had and he loved my white pizza  too, as did I.     I got the Mediterranean... Go here you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Cute place!
Beet salad and corn soup were great! My boyfriend got the egg salad salmon sandwich which was pretty good. 
I asked for an alcoholic version of their lemonade mojito, yum!
Indie music goin on was fun for a slow lunch day. Hope to come back and try some flatbread and more:)"}
{"text":"Very good food! We ordered a bunch of stuff for the 4 of us, and we were sufficiently full afterward. The price was good too!

The best part is the patio...very spread out, so you have your own space. It also has a great feel to it.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We arrived after happy hour so the place was emptying out, there were only two other couples at tables and two couples at the bar.  After our food arrived the waiter never asked if we needed anything else, and never came back to ask if everything was OK!  We had to flag him down for condiments.  He never asked if we needed another drink.  We had to flag him down for seconds.  We had to call him over to remove our plates!  He was very busy moving tables and chairs, and making a remarkable amount of noise sliding the chairs and tables on the concrete floor.  It was not pleasant!  We spent over $70.00 and felt like the service and atmosphere was less than McDonald's!"}
{"text":"Just had our first experience with TIMO. Outstanding. Food, ambiance, service, etc.
The tapas are terrific and the environment is great. Try the bruschetta, the lamb chop tapa's , the escargot, and the creme brulee! You won't regret it!
Fans of Postino's will find it a worthy competitor/alternative."}
{"text":"Delicious!   Fantastic service, a great small neighborhood restaurant.  Looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"Breathtaking night out at Timo's !

Me and the wife went out last Friday night to check this place out.
Since we have kids and don't get out much we choose always something that's worth the time we have to spend out.

We started with the Bruschetta and the Antipasto salad for appetizers.
We ordered Gruener Veltiner from Austria for the wife and a Aventinus Wheat Doppelbock for me.

We then ordered Cedar Plank Wild King Salmon and Prosciutto Wood Fired Sandwich as our entrees.

Wow, this kind of food is hard to find around here and it was outstanding.
Our server Alexis was always smiling and has been very attentive all night.

We finished the night off with some Espresso and ordered the peach cobbler with ice cream and indulged us into dessert heaven, Yum.

If you are looking for some nice and romantic time out or even as a family, this is a place you need to check out.

We came all the way from Cave Creek and will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I really like the patio atmosphere at Timo, nice and quiet. This is a great spot for a date! The staff was friendly... I will come back for sure"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Enjoyed some wine and appetizers during happy hour. Their bread and citrus better and pesto is to die for! We set inside since it's still too hot to enjoy the outdoor patio. The inside atmosphere was perfect it was quiet. Service was great and we plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"If you are out of town and here for the Super Bowl, you have to stop in at Timo Wine Bar. Great atmosphere and friendly staff! Nathan is the go to guy at this place!"}
{"text":"Timo is such a cute place! I went here for happy hour. The drink specials were awesome! I can't wait to come back and sit out on the patio in the fall!"}
{"text":"We just got home from a great evening on the patio at Timo Wine Bar.  Totally enjoyable, nearly magical, atmostphere....large canopied mesquite trees, comfortable seating, and a big fire pit to center it all.  We breezed through the indoors just to check it out and it was very classy and well designed; the embossed leather wallpaper is gorgeous!

From the time we approached the hostess stand until the time we ran out the door through a surprising burst of rain, the service was friendly, prompt, and stellar.  Even the slices of bread served with our goat cheese were replenished as they started to get low...a rare bit of service that helped to take it over the top!

We shared a plate of 3 bruschetta (tomato and creamy brie, salmon with creme fraiche and preserved lemon, and a pesto/basil/tomoato concoction) and also the creamy goat cheese and olives.  The breads are all baked on-site in a wood oven...very delicious all the way around!

We had some pinot grigio and chardonnay...both top drawer!  our friend introduced us to the most amazing Spanish beer...Estrella Damm Inedit.  I swear I will go back here just for this beer....absolutely the best beer I've ever tasted in my life!  (And I've been around the block and to numerous breweries to boot!)   If you come by this great new joint in town, definitely put the Estrella Damm on your list....and get the large bottle...$14 but it will fill your glass nearly three times!   They even serve the bottle in a chiller to keep it perfectly chilled.

Five stars for Timo!   We Shall Return!"}
{"text":"A very nice cozy spot. I drop in for a quick cocktail and boy was I surprised I a pineapple lavender a signature cocktail. Organic and delicious . And salmon cornbread cakes and chocolate creme breule  just say this I'll be back !"}
{"text":"I first came here for a working lunch and found it to be very easy going and unique.  I thoroughly enjoyed the extensive patio area.  The food was excellent and the staff was friendly.  Make sure you schedule extra time because the wait time is a little longer than usual, probably because their food is made fresh."}
{"text":"Nice patio. Food was good, but not exactly my favorite. Service wasn't the quickest, but we were not in a hurry so it was fine."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place! I travel a lot and always try to find healthy and local places to try. They were extremely accommodating with me dietary restrictions and had a variety of vegetarian and gluten free options. I loved the Beet salad and the tapas lamb chops were excellent for a small plate! They have a decent wine list and a decent happy hour on good vino! Contemporary atmosphere with a relaxed vibe. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for after dinner drinks for my husband and I. We had already had sushi so we were just going to find good wine and nice conversation.

We found both!

We were promptly seated at the fire pit outside as requested. It wasn't lit yet when we arrived, but was lit within a few minutes of our arrival. It was a very nice mild evening anyway so the heat from the fire was nice but not overbearing.  We received water immediately and our server showed up a few minutes later with menus. They have a lot of great food choices but I can't say if the food is good since we only went for the drinks. The drink selection is rather large also, plenty of wine, beers and cocktails to choose from. Service was very friendly, a little slow at first but steady and appreciated by the end of the evening.

Since we were only having wine our server stopped by when she noticed the glasses nearly empty to ask if we'd like another glass. Perfect!

The atmosphere was great, service very good and the wine we had was also very good. The only drawback was the music. When we first arrived they were playing some sort of coffee house alternative music, or something. But we didn't come for the music so no big deal. Well as the evening went on the music selection (or Pandora station) got better. In fact, when Phantom of the Opera by Lindsey Sterling began to play both my husband and I took notice (we're fans of both), suddenly the music changed!  It was still Lindsey Sterling but now one of the theme's from Zelda was playiing (my husbands absolute fav). We had just started to enjoy that when that was changed and they started playing something completely different. 

Now, this obviously didn't ruin the evening, but it did impact the atmosphere. We were not the only ones enjoying the music. Several other diners also made comments about changing the music, especially from Phantom. Now perhaps a diner inside didn't like it and asked for the change, but I doubt it. Anyway, overall it was a nice experience and we will definitely go here again next time we're in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar on a busy Thursday night. Amy the bartender really took care of us. She makes some great drinks and made some helpful food and drink recommendations."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch. Had a few different items.  Great food and service.  Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I love Timo!! The food, the atmosphere and the decor are incredible. I went for lunch and enjoyed their roasted chicken with arugula and potato fries. It was divine. I am addicted now. I have since had the chicken pesto sandwich, chicken ceasar salad, one of their breakfast flatbreads with an egg and each of their German beers! My God, the place has delicious food. The servers are still learning their groove but no compliants."}
{"text":"Ive been going to timo for about a year now. At first I was blown away by the chicken pesto blt and the timo bread with citrus butter. Over time I've noticed the quality of these items as well as the service start to decline. This last time I ordered the same two items. Our timo bread was very burnt. I was surprised that a chef would send that let alone that a server would take that to a table. Then my sandwhich. First, I noticed that instead of using sundried tomatoes they now use to large slices of raw tomatoe wich really brought it down. Second I realized that there was no bacon on my sand which. When I told the waitress she started informing me that it wasn't really a blt but they substitute bacon with a \"slice of pork\"...? After a few minutes of discussion I was given a side of fried pancetta...
This place used to be epic but has declined greatly. It's not gross but not worth paying the price tag for what you're served
Way bummed:("}
{"text":"Spring is in the air...and on the table, all over the floor and eventually all over you. This is one of two downfalls of sitting outside. It would behoove them to have daily lawn maintenance of at the very least blow away the tree flowers and debris. One individual kept his wine glass covered with his appetizer plate to keep the tree \"dander\" from filling into his drink. The second downfall- you can get tennis elbow from swatting away flies.

More general, the patio is perfect for group get togethers. They have a outdoor fire pit nested by lounge patio furniture. 

I went with a pal for happy hour and we left fairly happy. The hh cocktail was tasty, but had too much ice and eventually ended up something like weak lemonade.

For eats we had the escargot. We both favored this dish over the other food items we ordered. We also ordered three of the bruschetta. Listed in order of preference Fig/Apple/Brie, salmon/creme/dill/caper and lastly the prosciutto/mozzarella.

Food and drinks were served promptly. 

The food was good and happy hour pricing was fair. During our visit, there were mostly middle aged individuals. I didn't get a \"trendy\" feel and I would likely return . 

Attention to detail; fix wobbly table, trim back trees, blow out patio area, general tidiness would likely raise the rating."}
{"text":"Why aren't more people going here? Well maybe everyone is keeping this wonderful place a secret. Go and try especially on Sunday or Monday the \"date night\" specials are great."}
{"text":"Outdoor patio was great.  Nice lighting and ambience.  Waitress was great - being attentive balanced with leaving us to converse with our friends.  Food was great. Bruschetta choices were all good.  Wood-fired Mediterranean thin crust pizza was wonderful! Spanish red wine was superb.   Wonderful night all around."}
{"text":"Wow! What an amazing place. The food was absolutely to die for. I had the escargot, and my friend had a brie and truffle oil soup that was absolutely wonderful. Even their Caesar salad was the best I ever had.

The service was great. I ordered a lemon drop. The waitress realized the glass was too small and sent it back to the bartender to put (and add more) in a larger glass. I didn't even have to ask.

This place is far above what Bomberos was, and I liked Bomberos. I highly recommend this place to anyone and plan on becoming a regular customer here."}
{"text":"Everything you could want in a wine bar plus so much more!!  The staff goes above and beyond; Nathan is my favorite ;)  Absolutely love the food, love the patio, love the location.  It's more than you can ask for in a quaint neighborhood bistro.  I think I'll go tonight!"}
{"text":"Two wine bottles in...my recommendation...try the South African blend! Our waiter Nate was a gem, my soup, the butternut squash was delicious and I think I am coming back for my evening Bachelorette party. ..this twinkle lighting is to die for!"}
{"text":"It's such a shame that the service doesn't match the food and decor...  This is our third time visiting.  Service has left a lot to desire each time, but the food is what has brought us back - until now...

Early this afternoon, it was apparent that the owner/manager was not there.  Staff was clearly heard complaining to eachother as guests where trickling in.  One example:  \"Oh Gawd, they just keep coming in.. We are trying to leave!\"    Umm.. Really?  

Server didn't know how to make a latte.. brought me an espresso with cream floated on the top instead.  He had the audacity to say, \"Well, what did you want then?  It's a latte.  There is cream on it, but we are out of large cups.\"  Really?  The latte cups are stacked adjacent to the machine.  He then told me that he's never made one before and would find someone to make it for him.  I should have known better and cancelled the order there.  Instead, watched someone show him how to make it on a filthy dirty machine...  the frother is crusted over.  Neither one of them bothered to clean it off when they were finished either.  The water bottles can be a nice touch, but they need to be clean and water spot free, in the bright daylight greasy fingerprints from crappy waiters man-handling them look disgusting.

Server only came around when it was time to give us our check.  He was really charming when we were getting ready to leave a gratuity.   We left just 15%.

Again, the food is really good.  The cooks seem to be the only staff that gives a damn.   

The waitstaff doesn't have to worry about us being a bother to them by coming in for lunch/dinner/or brunch again.

To the owner: 
 May we suggest some customer service staff training?  We are a very laid-back and loyal repeat-customer type couple.  This is the 3rd time sh*&+y service for us.  We won't be back!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be one of our favorites in Central Phoenix. We gave it one more try after our last time was mediocre. This time was even worse. Bread arrived stale, short ribs were ice cold in the middle. Sent it back and they came back room temperature. They are obviously just heating stuff up instead of cooking it anymore. Too bad. This used to be such a great restaurant. It was our go to place for guests or parties."}
{"text":"This was my second visit but this time for lunch and with my husband. I wanted him to try the Margherita pizza which I enjoyed my first time. It was cold outside so we both got the Normandy brie soup with black truffle.  This was a little salty for my taste but still delicious. The service and food has been consistently good.  This is a place you can go with some friends or on a date.  I'll be back with my husband and friends for dinner soon."}
{"text":"What a quaint little spot! They have a great patio however we chose to sit inside, but only because the patio chairs were too \"loungy\" for us to eat dinner. I'm sure the patio is perfect for happy hour and relaxing with friends! There were maybe 4 tables with chairs to actually eat. DEFINITELY make a reservation,...even on a week night. There are maybe 10 tables (mix of 2 top and 4 top) inside. The service was great! The atmosphere and decor is cute. Once the sun goes down they open the glass garage doors and let fresh air in. It felt like being outside! We had the scallops, meatballs, salmon platter, and margherita pizza with sausage. Everything we ate was delicious! I would absolutely recommend this place. Thanks, Yelp, for the recommendation!!"}
{"text":"What a hidden little gem! K and I met friends for happy hour wine and tapas-style appetizers. Sitting on the patio we were actually a little chilly (it was mid-June) because of the lay out and how secluded the outdoor space is. We found ourselves talking about how nice the patio will be during the summer and the winter with the fireplace. Service was prompt but not hovering which was perfect. Wine was reasonably priced and the small plate tapas delicious. We shared the crab cakes, copa ham & prosciutto and a delicious Pinot noir. All highly recommended. K and I had so much fun we stayed longer and had the baked lasagna special (includes a bottle of wine but we had already had 2 with friends). I normally don't like Italian food at restaurants but this was excellent. Most people butcher pasta but not here. Delicious and al dente. Service stayed consistent. 

If you want an intimate date night or a great place to relax on a best-kept secret of a patio with friends, this is your place."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our wine and appetizers on Timo's back patio. It was the night of the Sunnyslope Art Walk and they were slammed with people. After a reasonable wait, we had a very helpful server, great bottle of wine (Snapdragon Pinot Noir) and appetizers (try the warm fig and prosciutto - so good!). We will definitely be back to support this gem in our neighborhood..."}
{"text":"I went yesterday with a Groupon.  The food and service was amazing.  I truly hope this place makes it.  There was hardly anyone there.  The food was out of this world and I hope to go back soon.  Our waiter, Sean, provided excellent service."}
{"text":"So far I really like the food I've had. The pesto chicken sandwich was great. I enjoyed the pancetta flatbread as well. I dig the decor and ambiance too. One issue though was a pretty slow bartender two times in a row. Also no happy hour deals on a Friday was pretty lame. But then again the happy hour deals aren't really that great anyway. So I think overall the drinks are overpriced but that does not usually stop me from frequenting a place...So I do like the place and will be going back for sure, there may be more stars to follow"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch last Friday with my wife sat outside good atmosphere, flat bread was great!! The app's were good as well. I'll try it again"}
{"text":"Really impressed. My honey had the small plate meatballs which he enjoyed. I had a crispy kale salad; if you like you can get any of their salads in a smaller portion for $5. I also had a blue crab cake which was mostly crab and not a lot of fillers... Yum! White peach sangria was good and $6.95. The staff was very friendly, and the place is small but cute with a garage door front and industrial style with pretty velvet chairs. They have a pretty and dog-friendly patio with live music on Thursdays. The coolest part was sitting at the bar watching the chef create everything right in front of us in the wood-fired oven. We'll be back for their great specials like lasagna dinner for two with a bottle of wine for $22(!)"}
{"text":"The best beat salad and sangria in Phx.Michelle was very helpful with suggestions. ..loved it so much I made reservations for brunch"}
{"text":"Be sure to finish with the bread pudding & upgrade with a shot of Knob Creek poured over The Top!!"}
{"text":"This is a really cool local spot. The food is amazing, the staff is friendly and watching the chef cook using that stone oven is quite entertaining. Timo has a great thing going. We need more like this place in North Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, food and service!!! Always a favorite spot. I especially enjoy sitting outside on the patio and sipping on wine while snacking on the cheese board. It is So much fun, I always bring my friends and guests here because it's so unique. Also the home made bread is to die for!"}
{"text":"Delicious. We stopped in for a quick bite before a concert. Had the Smoked Salmon and Corn Cakes and the Antipasto plate. Yummmmm! We will be back to sample other menu items."}
{"text":"Great patio and music on a Thursday night. Appetizers were unique and well done. Housemade sausage sandwich was out of sight. We wish this was in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Precision! Excellent service. Great food. Wait staff were fluid in their service as was the chef!"}
{"text":"Find this place on a whim.
So glad I did.
Well def be one of my go To
The drinks were so good and flavorful and I could taste the liquor.
Food was also good.
Went for happy hour.
Will be back to chill outside with a bottle of wine very soon"}
{"text":"After reading all of the positive reviews about Timo
on Yelp, I decided to give it a try. We made reservations not knowing how busy it would be, especially since there was a small group of us on a weekend. When we got there the waitress gave us an option of 2 tables: a 4 seat table (there were 6 of us) or a table with a couch and deep patio chairs which didn't seem conducive to eating a meal. We chose the outdoor couch/chairs and noticed that they were filthy. We tried to brush all the dirt/leaves off and our hands were black indicating that they likely hadn't been cleaned in some time. We tried to be positive, cleaned the chairs and sat down. We ordered our drinks/appetizer and while we were waiting we started getting wafts of a sewer smell. We got our drinks and the cornbread (which was not at all cornbread - instead it was some sort of odd breadstick) and continued getting the sewer smell- it was AWFUL!! Our intention was to have dinner there but our experience was so awful we decided to leave. Don't be fooled by the cute patio pictures online - in person it's much less romantic and certainly leaves much to be desired. It's getting a 2 star review solely based on the fact that I enjoyed my glass of wine."}
{"text":"Always amazing! We eat here and spoke and wheel a couple of times a month but decided to try the New Year's Eve, 6 course meal. We are never disappointed but this was an exceptional meal! Spoke and wheel is what it is but we mostly go there for drinks and to watch the games. Timo's is a hidden gem and you can't go wrong with anything, especially their meat and fish entrees."}
{"text":"Excellent food, ambience, wine, service. Will be back again very soon. Love the reverse happy hour..."}
{"text":"Checked out Timo for the first time today for lunch. I must say I was was pleasantly surprised!

You can almost miss the parking lot if you don't look close enough (dork alert!), it shares the lot with what I looks like an office building? But there was SHADE to park in, if you parked near their patio!! 

Speaking of patio, it looks like an awesome place to check out when the weather is less disgusting.  Unfortunately AZ being AZ in August, it is FAR from patio weather! However, I can imagine it to be a great place for a girls night or a date when the weather is more accommodating!

Having never been here before I was salivating by the descriptions on the menu, and had trouble deciding.  The wine list was awesome, it had some options on it I was unfamiliar with, and had quite the amusing time trying to pronounce, but the bartender (Adrian, I believe is what he said his name was?) was quite helpful & answered all my questions.  He even was kind as to give me a couple pointers as to what wines I might like based on what I said I usually drank.

The atmosphere inside was great, very quaint and chic at the same time.  Definitely a good place to gather with friends or enjoy a glass of wine to unwind at the end of the day. Very bright and airy, and they had these awesome glass garage doors that allowed for good people watching.

This part of town does not have many options when it comes to fun, chill, and chic places, so I hope this place sticks around.  And if my experience today with a great menu and awesome bartender is any indication of how it usually is there, I will definitely look forward to coming back and bringing friends as well!  Thanks Timo for becoming my new place to like and a great experience on a random Monday afternoon off!"}
{"text":"Great place to hangout once the weather cools. Has great wine. I wish they had live music."}
{"text":"Wow! What an amazing place, from the beautiful patio to the amazing service. The staff really made me feel at home. It has to be one of the best date places in Phoenix. But the thing i liked the most was the type of food, it has a tapas feel except the portions are allot larger. If your on a budget and want to impress someone this is the spot."}
{"text":"Liked this place when it was Bombero's and like the  reincarnation even better.  The outside area is one on the better al fresco spots on the North side of town.  I have been twice recently and had great food both times - First itme, everyone ordered their own thing and the second we just noshed on flatbread, pizza, spinach dip etc.

Nice happy hour from until 6 $5 vino and some discounted apps.

Service has been fine both times, on of the visits they had 4 or five large parties but stayed on top of things with only minor delays."}
{"text":"Great meal with excellent service and suggestions from Nathan.  Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Love the food and service, showed up with large group and they happily took care of us. Food, service was awesome, will be back."}
{"text":"Terrific little bistro. The food is prepare by a chef who cares about quality and presentation. Great Monday and Sunday specials. The non happy hour cocktails are expensive $9. Skip the overpriced cocktails and delve into the nice selection of wines. Stop in and enjoy delicious food and wonderful wines."}
{"text":"Our family had an excellent Sunday brunch at Timo. The patio was the perfect setting with the umbrella and trees to keep us in the shade. Highly recommend the Timo Eggs Benedict and the Bloody Mary. Very friendly and attentive staff too. We will return!"}
{"text":"In Phoenix for business and found this place on Yelp.   Great little place with amazing food and wine.  Great patio area.  Michelle was wonderful."}
{"text":"Went for girls night with a friend, the food was awesome and the Mediterranean pizza has the best pesto I've ever tasted. Dessert was delicious (chocolate creme brûlée oh my! ). For a wine bar I expected the  server to come out with a little more wine knowledge and ask questions, offer some information as they are so excellent at doing at kazmierz. But otherwise a lovely setting for a chill evening - I'll go back for a romantic night with the hubby;)"}
{"text":"Just moved here from Laguna, CA and this is our new favorite place. My husband and I came for Monday date night which is $19 for a pizza and bottle of wine. I was blown away by the specials and and further impressed by the quality of the food and wine when our order came. This place is amazing and their staff is great. Michelle was our waitress and she was super friendly. She had great recommendations for the food and wine (my husband actually had a glass with me which is a huge accomplishment) and even told us about some great places to see in Phoenix. I can't wait to come back for their happy hour which looks amazing!

Another review that was sitting in my drafts that I totally forgot about. We moved about a year ago and haven't been back in awhile, but I loved this place and my coworker are having a happy hour here next week which I am definitely looking forward to. I think the Monday special is $21 now (raised it by $2), but that is still a steal!"}
{"text":"I am beyond excited about this new discovery! I discovered this place last week and plan to go for the 3rd time already tomorrow. I am excited to be a regular here at this locally owned business. They are the definition of a 5 star spot! They go above and beyond with all that they do. The wine selection is good and very diverse. They even offer my FAVORITE red wine, Apothic, which I've never seen in a wine bar before. They also have fabulous, made in-house red and white sangria's. The spinach artichoke dip is the best I've ever had! And believe me when I say I've had my fair share of spinach artichoke dips. The atmosphere is exactly what I look for in a wine bar. I cannot wait until the weather cools down so I can spend more time on the amazing patio. I've only peeked but I can tell I will be in love in a few months from now. The service here is just as impressive! The bartender, Amy is so cute and such a sweetheart! She it also meticulous when she shines all of those glasses. Looks like a lot of work but she handles it with ease. This place is at the top of my list. I better be careful or I will be a wino in no time!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Timo.  It's a little tricky to spot on Central Ave so watch closely and let your map app do the work.  Well worth the trip from the west valley.  The atmosphere is casual and comfortable, intimate and a bit on the Bohemian side.  Staff is attentive but not intrusive.  Food is excellent.  I had a glass of Malbec and the butternut squash tossed salad - inventive and so tasty.  Light, slightly sweet, and citrusy dressing. Greens are firm and fresh.  My date had a beer and a pizza with sausage.  Also excellent.  Thin, crisp, flavorful crust and a nice balance of sause, cheese and sausage.  Not the typical heavy, greasy disappointment found elsewhere. Great place for an early date night dinner.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"A good friend told me about the great music and atmosphere at Timo and since it's about 5 min away I figured I'd take my bros and family to check it out. 

This rating is for the food and service only - I  went around 4 on a Saturday, wasn't exactly jumping with people but it did make the service that much better :)

Order the Tiger Woods (a twist on the Arnie Palmer) which is lemondae with hibiscus tea (good for you \"Jamaica\" lovers) The Smoked salmon on corn cakes, crab cakes and the kalamari and mussels ceviche. ALL GOOD! Solid food and very fresh. I'm not much for the appeal or the presentation - just taste and quantity.- but the presentation was real nice and satisfied the eyes.  

My family had grilled chicken salads, different tapas like lamb chops and one with olives. Everyone liked their food. 

I would not come here if you're looking to feed the beast. But if you want to try some fresh, tasty, different foods then this will do.

I'm looking forward to eating here when it's busy and lively.

{"text":"Went to Timo on Saturady night with high hopes. We sat on the beautiful patio, but the service was horrible, our waitress literally forgot we were there multiple times. 15 minutes to receive your drinks?

I had the crab cakes which were mediocre. My bf had one of the pizzas, again, just ok.

One saving grace was the guy in the tshirt that took up our waitresses slack. He was a lifesaver.

Unfortunately, we wont be going back."}
{"text":"We were there Saturday night during the Sunnyslope Art Walk and experienced just a 25 minute wait for four for seating on the patio. Don't enter from the street, because the woman behind the bar did not nicely tell me to see the hostess on the other side. Don't put yourself through that--just enter from the parking lot/patio side.

Having said that, the patio was gorgeous. There's a nice fire pit, lots of little seating areas, and gorgeous old trees and vines.

The service, on the other hand, was pretty terrible. The sweet, young hostess tried her best to get us served, but it was futile. We sat at a dirty table for 10 min. or so. Then sat another 15 before she got a waitress for us. Our meals came out in a timely manner, but we had to ask for more water, ask for the the wine menu, etc. We got so tired of waiting we decided against another round and dessert. What surprised me the most was that there seemed to be no one experienced supervising a really young staff. No one (like a manager or owner) came through to check on tables or apologize for the wait at the table and lack of service.

The food was a bit better. My girlfriend had the BLT and chips. The sandwich was large and a bit charred but she said it was great. I had the bruschetta. I highly recommend the spicy copa and pesto, which was excellent. I'd pass on the brie, apple and figs, as the figs were terribly bitter and the over-sauced bread quickly became soggy.

The wine and beer lists were reasonably priced for by the glass or bottle.

We're hoping they improve on service for our next visit. It smelled so good that we'd like to give them another shot. I just hope it wasn't actually the Little Caesar's nearby..."}
{"text":"Excellent service from Nathan! Great food and great wine selection. You need to check it out."}
{"text":"Postino's of the North! Nice patio and vibe... definitely worth checking out if you live up north."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Used to like this place but honestly for the atmosphere. Haven't been in a year till last night and with a reservation was seated at a table on slanted stone that rocked in complete darkness - an after-thought taLuckily after asking was moved to opening table in light so you could not only read the menu but see what you were eating.  Warning:  if you order the brussel sprout salad don't expect roasted, flavorful sprouts.  They are served raw, cold, hard, tough and disgusting at $10.50!  The chef worked hard to slice them in half and put them on a plate.  I love escargot and what they lack in quality they make up for in quantity so skip this too.  Salmon bruschetta was toasted french bread, canned salmon & cream cheese with a few capers - about what you'd expect with a bagel at three times the price. We usually get a bottle of wine but instead got two drinks each and this was $86 WITHOUT tip.    You decide."}
{"text":"I have been to Timo a few times and always enjoyed it.  However, this last time I went the bartender was very rude. I didn't know the hours were different than what was posted on the website.  We came in and just wanted drinks and we were told that would be fine.  Then we were rushed because the bartender wanted to go home. Our server was very nice. The bartender came over to us and started to take our bottle of wine and informed us \"it was time to go\". I have never been so rushed out of somewhere while finishing a drink. Very rude and have just lost customers because of this. Too bad because I did like this place."}
{"text":"Eden was amazing! My husband and I came here for his birthday celebration and we came back the next day because of the amazing food and service. We have Sundays and Mondays off which is perfect because Timo's has amazing dinner specials for both days at a great price."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the food and drink at the Sunday brunch. The sangria's, both white and red were really good.
We had the bruschetta and we sampled about 4 different kinds. The ones that stick out are the portobello, and the poca. But you can't go wrong with any of them as they were all really well done.  We also had the flatbread and I really enjoyed them. The chicken jalapeño and short rib were my favorite. I will definitely be back! Great patio when the weather cools off."}
{"text":"I think this would be a  pretty cool place to come and hang out at night most of the seating is outside inside is small my food was good the kale salad wasn't good it was kale chips I think couldn't eat it the pizza was very good can't remember the name it was like a Greek pizza full of flavor a little crispy  very nice the bar tender was awesome drink never go close to empty soon as food was out it he gave it to me the only reason I gave 3 stars was siting at the bar watching the cook he never washed his hands never put gloves on when making g my salad  he goes outside comes back still no washing of the hands hopefully after the bathroom other then that pretty cool place will be back to try something else"}
{"text":"I love this hidden gem.   I started coming here when my mom went into an extended stay at JCL now Banner--
This is the deal..., amazing wine and food.
Before i go into the food I have to say this is one of my favorite hangouts
I met Marcus, server, he is by far my favorite person here!! My sis and I walk in and Marcus knows us by name!!!   
Amy, Sarah, Enrique, and Nathan- who is a young thin Vince Vaughn are all fun, smart and a great reason to come!!
  Food// my fav the smoked salmon platter.  A house smoked salmon fillet- with egg salad and a lemon vodka crime fraiche... Amazing on the best bread you will ever have.  Order extra bread.  
  The cheese plates and antipasto and huge and an amazing cornicopia of flavors!!! 
  All pizzas are wood fired-- amazing!!
The Sunday breakfast items are all sooooo good!!
All I can say is go!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Get the salmon!  Hell, EVERYTHING I've had there has been great!  Still haven't had anything bad! :)"}
{"text":"This was our first time and loved it. Very nice classy casual atmosphere. Quaint, you can hear your table guest talk. Patio area looks nice-will come back to try it when its a little cooler. Great selection of lighter fair with a nice glass of wine and conversation. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My every experience at Timo has been delightful. With modern decor, friendly and courteous staff, wonderful dishes, and excellent rotating specials, you'll have a marvelous time. Amy, the bartender working every time I've visited, has been charismatic, perfect with her suggestions, and an absolute pleasure to dine with. 

I have had the bruschetta, the brie soup, several salads (the oven-roasted chicken salad tonight), the prosciutto pizza, the chicken pesto burrata BLT, and the creme brulee, and not once have I been disappointed with my choice in the slightest. 

Brunch on the lovely dog-friendly patio has been charming, and they've had no issues with providing a wide palette of different options for my vegan and vegetarian friends. This is, without a doubt, one of the best establishments I've encountered. I suggest you stop in, try the bruschetta, a glass of wine, and see if Timo is the same lovely fit for you."}
{"text":"My review is a little skewed because we went for Easter brunch not for a real dinner. I think they had a good idea but it was poorly executed. On a previous visit, I saw the sign advertising the Easter Brunch and it said there would be a carving, pasta, and omelette station, among other things for $32 per person. Sounded like a good deal along with the $5 Mimosas. They had the \"buffet\" set up on the bar. The \"carving station\" was a pork loin, although verrry tasty, I don't think that 1 piece of meat qualifies as a carving station. They did have several options for the omelette but only 2 pastas and 2 sauces, one of which was their brie soup. The Mimosas had hardly any champagne/sparkling wine and the juice had pulp. Weird right? Pulp in a Mimosa. There was a sampling of other things but after everything was said and done our bill was $105 with tip. We definitely left full but not satisfied with the money spent. I think the restaurant itself is gorgeous and I saw that they have some fun specials during the week. I might like to go back for happy hour or to bring out of town guest for a few drinks."}
{"text":"From the twinkle-lighted, tree-shaded,, casual dog-friendly patio, to the blazing Pizza oven inside behind the bar, Timo on Central Ave is one of our regular spots. We appreciate the good food, good wine bar selection, and terrific service. I love to go on nights with live music and nights like now when the big firepit is fired up to dispelled a chill...lots of great things about the place. 
My favorite is the white sauce crispy crust pizzas with chicken and asparagus, and there are the more traditional pizzas too. Love the salads and bruschetta. 
It's in our area so we prefer it to further downtown most evenings. Bike friendly and easy parking."}
{"text":"Checked out Timo's for the first time yesterday. Fell in love with the Brie soup and salmon small plate. My only complaint is that they are so far! ;)"}
{"text":"Cute place and I really wanted to like it, but the food was awful.  The sauce tasted canned, the cheese wasn't melted on the chicken parmesan nor on the French onion soup."}
{"text":"I went to Timo with a girlfriend for drinks and loved it! The red sangria is amazing. The menu is so appealing we ended up eating. We shared a crab cake benedict (which is offered on the dinner menu since its so good). We also shared the smoked salmon on the tapas menu.. delicious.  I'm a huge patio person and I loved there's. It is so inviting, we commented several times that it feels like you're in your backyard relaxing. They also have a big fire pit with comfy couches around it, I can't wait to check it out on the cooler nights. The manager, Jason, is unbelievable friendly. We watched him interact and genuinely thank all the guests that left. It shows how proud he is of this cozy little place.  You get the best of both worlds here.. drinks with the girls or it can be a more intimate place for date night. I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is the best! Michelle is an excellent server and she gave wonderful suggestions for food & wine. The escargot is delicious"}
{"text":"This is our first time coming here and it was a wonderful experience! Our waiter, Nathan, was superb. Love the ambiance and the bruschetta was fantastic."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of attending Timo's Grand Opening earlier last week.  I have to say this place is very impressive.

If you are an ambiance junkie like me this place has it all.  The back courtyard is well appointed with mature trees, metal architecture and large open space with the perfect mood lighting for a quiet dinner.  It is one of those places you feel perfectly at peace taking your time and enjoying the wine.  Great ambient, well selected tunes humming about.  

I had a few of the tapas entrées and they were outstanding.  I wouldn't normally consider myself a bread fan, but their bread made me a convert for a night.  The Dough they use for the Wood fired flatbreads is decadent.  I chose the simple Margherita and it was melt in your mouth delicious.   The Citrus Mussels with calamari ceviche was the perfect lightweight compliment.  

Thank god Timo arrived in this neighborhood that has seemingly been void of any  out of the ordinary fine dining options.

Check it out and be greeted by the lovely, well appointed staff.  Have an extra glass for me =)"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed several meals here and brought many people. The bruschetta is great . I love the cheesy corn bread, Krispy kale salad, pizza l. The sangria is delicious. The desserts ( I think it was a peach cobbler out of this world. Service has always been great! One of my local spots"}
{"text":"Two Stars are for the service and ambience. The food, however, was horrible. Granted, we did come here on a Monday in the middle of the day and there were no other customers, but just the quality of the food itself was poor. The buttersquash soup had a gelatinous consistency with way too much flour in it. It tasted like gummy potpourri. The plum tomato soup was watery and tasted like Campbell's soup. Having recently enjoyed Postino's and even Sauce's tomato soups, Timo's soup was a considerable disappointment. The bread for the sandwiches was not freshly baked and lacking depth compared to other fresh baked breads. There was nothing \"wood fired\" about it- more like \"heated really quickly in a wood oven.\" Definitely will not be returning here for food but perhaps for wine on the patio, which is a nice find for the area and is dog friendly!!"}
{"text":"I am in love.  I live very close to Timo, and this was my first time.  We sat on the patio, and the weather was perfect... the ambience was perfect, with the twinkle lights and fire, and the soft, trance, club/new wave music playing, it was awesome!!  The service was also wonderful!  The food was the star, however.  We got the bread and the siracha shrimp to start.  OMG, those shrimp.. were so huge and sweet and sooo spicy and flavorful.. And the bread, with the pesto and honey butter..  YUM!  I got the bruschetta, and those were yummy too!  Others in my part got the eggplant lasagna, the beet salad, the Mediterranean pizza, and a roasted chicken salad.  Everything was amazing.  Then we split the chocolate creme brulee,  that was so rich, and was a perfect end to our meal.  I will most definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Decent but not worth a second trip for me. Went for brunch and it was very empty had to send Benedict eggs back because they were over done, this is a pet peeve of mine. Every thing is cooked in a brick oven so to redo it took awhile and then the bread under wasn't toasted. Just not great execution but the people were nice. There were also flies everywhere inside not fun to eat and swat flies. I did think that the bloody Mary was good. This place isn't close to much so needs to be awesome to draw people back."}
{"text":"I had their kale Cesar for the first time and I must say it is so yummy!!! So good!!! Also, I had a great server. He was so so nice ! His name is Matt! They used to have some really bitchy girls working here a few years ago so the service we got from Matt was a huge upgrade! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The white sangria is amazing! And all of their bruschetta is delicious, my favorite is the lemon ricotta honey. SO GOOD. the patio is beautiful as well. AND a great happy hour. What more can I say?! I will be definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Is a gem in the Sunny Slope area. This modern hip bar is just like ones one would find in LA, New York and Scottsdale. It is sleek clean and had wonderful waitstaff that me to visit it again. The seating out doors was wonderful around the fire pit. The other heaters were hit or miss think that is something the can fix easily. I did not try the food but the menu looked and smelled wonderful. The wood burning pizza oven gave the inside a wonderful woody smell. The wine select was amble and the mixed drinks were well made not too strong or too weak. They were out of decaf at the time but I would guess that too is an easy fix. The kitchen closes at 10 but the rest of the bar is open to 11. I again a neighbor hood gem that gives you the vibe of in the midtown Phoenix area but in Sunny Slope."}
{"text":"Delightful atmosphere and friendly staff.  Cannot wait to enjoy the outside patio! Suggest having some wine flights and a dense, crusty grilled Italian bread with the cheese board.  Lovely wines!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"FINALLY got to try this place...it's been on the list for a while now!  Came for a late brunch with one of the brunch buddies and it was just lovely.  We sat inside (if IS August, after all) and had a bloody while perusing the menu.  Our server, Emily, was a big help, recommending the frittata and the crab cake bennie.  The chef made a mistake and made a breakfast flatbread for me instead and it was just heavenly!  I'm looking forward to going back when it's cool enough to sit outside and lounge.  The Bloody was nice but I suspect I will be trying something a tad more exotic from the intriguing menu on my next trip.  The playlist was really entertaining and I really dig that they are dog-friendly.  Thumbs up, all the way!  The way to get to 5 stars?  I'll let you know after I try the desserts."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our first date night out since our new baby and it was beyond what we expected. The food was incredible. We had the meat and cheese board as well as the vegetable board. Then we split the wood fire chicken which was so moist and tasty we ended up fighting over the last bite! Lol. Last of all, Michelle, our amazing waitress suggested we try the chocolate cherry creme brulee. It was the highlight of our entire night and hands down the best I have ever had. 
If you're looking for a hip and unique wine bar with great food come here and ask for Michelle."}
{"text":"My last trip here was very disappointing.  Where to begin?   It took a while for our server to show up.  Interesting side note: While waiting for our server we couldn't help but notice out of the 24 patrons in the restaurant 23 were female LOL!  The happy hour menu was okay but nothing too spectacular, select wines $5 or $7 dollars, select cocktails were I think $5, and some discounted apps, bruschetta $3.  

We ordered two cocktails and a bruschetta.  They didn't have the cucumber for the drink I selected so I had them modify it with raspberries...didn't have that either.  Anyway I ended up with an interesting gin drink, which worked because I was very thirsty at that point.  The bruschetta that was supposed to come out of the brick oven looked good BUT was cold.  I mean it was cooked in a brick oven , somebody probably changed their mind or whatever; it was then put it in a fridge to preserve it and failed to heat it up again, which was then served to us cold.  At that point we decided not to have dinner here and left to go somewhere else.  

I am very disappointed, I loved this place when it opened!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and patio.  I had the soup and salad.  The salad listed it had blueberries and raspberries in it and that sounded refreshing.  When I got the salad, the berries were dehydrated and crunchy.  Not what I expected.  I know you can still buy fresh blueberries and raspberries because a week later I saw them at Frys.  That was disappointing.  But I would go back..  It's a cute place."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and had a great experience, but the true test of a great restaurant, in my humble opinion, is consistency so a five star review might be on the horizon for Timo.

First off, the ambiance is awesome! Love the decor, the outdoor seating and being able to see the wood fire oven in action in restaurants is always a nice touch in my book.

My boyfriend and I went there for dinner. The server we had was attentive, taking our drink orders in a timely manner and didn't make us feel like we were rushed when we took our time looking at the dinner menu. I ordered the ceder plank salmon. It was cooked to perfection, the glaze was a great compliment to the great cut of fish and the sides were awesome. It came with garlic kale which (my ONLY complaint) may have been a tad bit too salty, and a hearty portion of couscous. My boyfriend ordered the lemon oregano chicken. I forgot what else came with it but that too was delicious! The portions were filling, but of course, we made room for dessert. We shared the peach cobbler and were not disappointed. In fact, I would go there just for the cobbler...and a few glasses of wine! 

The wait for food was a little on the lengthy side, but it was worth it! I will never take speed over quality of food so if I've got to wait for a fantastic meal, then wait I will.  If you're looking to enjoy a leisurely dinner with great company then this is the place for you. I can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"I came here with a dog brunch group and it was wonderful. At least 12 of us had dogs and there wasn't any kind of negative experience with that. The server. Nathan, even cared enough to learn our names from the start to make it easier when the bills came. I don't like many breakfast type foods so brunch for me can be complicated but they had a lot of choices not containing eggs, bacon, sausage, etc. I had the 3 choice bruschetta, which came on big pieces of bread cut into 3s. Very good food, service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Jasmine was a wonderful waitress, very attentive and helpful.  The salmon was amazing as was the fig and prosciutto pizza.  I highly recommend the red sangria as well!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Timo's is within walking distance of our home and is in a stretch of Central that has seen places come and go. So far Timo's is hanging in there.

The patio is a good place to have wine and food and enjoy the great winter weather in Phoenix. We have had the pizzas and other entrees and most everything is good. Only once in the times we have gone have we had to send something back."}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch with old friends at this quaint, cozy place with a diverse, delicious menu and exquisite wine selection.  The bruschetta was wonderful, generously portioned and easily shared.  The hard to find corn cakes were mouthwatering.  Our wonderful server was Nick who was friendly, cheerful and perfectly attentive.  I have been to Timo's several times and would highly recommend it for lunch, happy hour or dinner."}
{"text":"I love coming here. It's a relaxing spot with a cute outdoor space and fire pit. The food is delicious every time and service is great."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. My husband & I chilled on the quaint patio sipping great wine. Ask for Nathan. He made us feel like new friends hanging out on his patio. AND the food was great! Try the beet salad & something from the wood fired oven, we had the Mediterranean white pizza. A-mazing."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing Salmon ever! The staff was very kind and accommodating.  The wine was exceptional  as well as the atmosphere.  Very well done."}
{"text":"Love the bruschetta here.  Hearty, meaty and simply delicious.  Outstanding service by the bar tender / waiter / trainer.  He is a hard worker and multi tasks.  Forgot his name.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I live in central Phoenix and had been hearing great things about Timo and decided to try it after a 5 1/2 hr drive back from San Diego last month.  I was so impressed with the service, food selection and atmosphere I returned last week for happy hour and brought a friend.  She is now a fan of Timo's too.  Both times I sat at the bar and Amy the bartender was great with her suggestions of both food and wine and her service was outstanding.  The pesto pizza was fabulous (but it's only available on Friday's).  I love the decor of the restaurant very hip and sleek, music selection is great and not too loud like some places.  I am anxious for the weather to cool down as they have an amazing patio with trees and candles.  This is absolutely one of my favorite go to places.  Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First impression that we got was that the parking was a bit awkward. We had to park in the adjacent building then walk over. When we first arrived we didn't realize we had walked past the hostess desk because the hostess was away. We were seated immediately outside (per our request). We wanted to try the happy hour and got our drinks first. In my opinion they should have a separate menu for that time. The atmosphere and outside decor probably would have looked a lot better during the night. Definitely got my arm work out swatting away at flies and sweeping off the table from the overhanging pollen shedding trees.
Our drinks were brought out to us in a timely manner. I got the Strawberry vodka drink and it was a little watered down. Definitely loved the escargot!!! Highly recommend it! The bruschetta was ok but not as flavorful or unique. Overall definitely would take my business there for happy hour or if I'm craving snails again!"}
{"text":"\"Great ambience n seating by the fireplace. Try out the bruschetta, smoked salmon and crab cake. They are to die for. Would love to go there again!!\""}
{"text":"Amy is the best bartender in the entire universe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  She is always welcoming and gives great information about menu items and wine pairings!  She always makes you feel like you are da bomb diggitty!"}
{"text":"Disappointed! Came with a group of friends... Server was inattentive... Always had to flag her down and very upset about the food! Food was cold once we received it since she waited for everybody's order to be ready . On top of that the food wasn't any good either... Highly disappointed!!"}
{"text":"OK..SO this past weekend some friends decided to meet at Timo for Brunch.. I reluctantly decided to join however much to my surprise there was some improvement in some areas.  Food Was Much better than previous visit however we had a group of 10 or 12 people and even thought we were virtually the only ones there the service was mediocre at best, so keep moving in the right direction guys"}
{"text":"We had a gift card so we thought we would check it out. As we were seated, we had to ask for a wipe down of the dirty table and then for them to dry it. We made it in time for happy hour so that was a bonus. We ordered entrees and I received a partially warm lasagna and hubby received 'a' short rib. The entrees were now desirable. I highly recommend apps and cocktails if you go."}
{"text":"OK, let me begin by saying that there are THREE things that I enjoy most about dining out. 1. The food. 2. The ambiance. 3. The quality of service. TIMO gets 5 stars for both their food and ambiance, and about 3.5 for the service. Now, the service isn't bad whatsoever, but I really enjoy a vivacious and personable waiter/waitress that spends a little time chatting with us. 

The place is small indoors, but cozy, with a brick oven and all. Outside has a really nice lounge area with a large fire pit and lights/heaters all over. Very romantic. 

The food is really really good. We've eaten here twice, and both times we had appetizers, salads, entrees, and even desserts. ALL fantastic, with consistent quality! 

And I think what I love most about this little gem, is that it's \"hidden\" and none of our friends really know about it, so we always feel cool when referring people! ;-)"}
{"text":"Love the ambience of this place! Patio is great with a warm firepit and lights strewn throughout the trees. Great for a date night."}
{"text":"I want to preface this review by stating that Timo's generally has a lot to offer. Their patio is GORGEOUS, their wine list is extensive so you are sure to find a new favorite, and their food is expertly crafted.

Unfortunately, last night I didn't get to enjoy any of that stuff. What I did get to experience, however, left a foul taste in my mouth and I will think twice before suggesting this as a place to come for date nights or any other special occasions.

Last night was Valentine's Day and they had a lovely Prix Fixe menu and when we were seated this was all we were given. Looking around I could see that people were eating pizzas and I wondered if I would be able to get one since it wasn't a part of the special V-Day menu. When the waitress first came up she hurriedly asked for our drink order. We didn't have a menu to order wine/beer/cocktails from,  so I politely asked if I could receive one. The waitress sighed heavily and walked aways and when she came back she had a wine menu in her hand that she just sort of threw in my general direction.

OK........

At this point I also decided to ask about the menu to see if they had something other than the special....Her response?

No. Just a flat no. So I started to mention that other people were eating stuff that wasn't on the special menu. She picked up on the fact that I had a question and then said \"well, yeah, we have a limited menu\" and then blankly stared at us.....I asked to see that menu too and again she looked kind of agitated and turned around and grabbed the menu and put it on the table and walked away.

Alright.......

At this point we were deciding if we even wanted to stay and deliberated for a couple of minutes. We were mostly thinking that we were looking for a positive, romantic experience and we weren't feeling like this was going to be possible at this time.

During this time the waitress comes back and asks to take our drink order. I let her know we needed a little more time, and she looked right at me and turn around and walked away quickly. 

This is when we decided to leave. We simply walked out without saying anything. I have never been treated so badly and I have never just left, but this was all too much. 

Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"It seems to me that everything here is cooked in a wood fire over, which is great. I really enjoy how crispy things come out of this type of oven. The wood fired wings are bomb! The tamarind sauce they put on them is super tasty and it's a good starter plate for sharing. I ordered the chicken dinner but it came out undercooked and the staff was more than accommodating. Mistakes happen and their response made up for it. I asked for more of the wings instead of a new plate and they were cool with it. Even brought me a few extra wings on the plate and I tore them up! Again, the wood fired are bomb! I passed on the mango dipping sauce that comes with them though. And to put the cherry on top of the experience they comped our dessert. The peach cobbler is amazing and I wish I'd had more room to finish it. Again, the crispy and saltiness of the cobbler crust was delicious. The chicken came out undercooked, which is the reason I didn't give it 5 stars, but I gave it 4 because of their response to the mishap and everything else was great to eat."}
{"text":"Came by on Thursday evening enjoyed beautiful live music on the patio with my boyfriend, our kids and pup! It was one of the best evenings I've had in a long time. I was worried it wouldn't be kid appropriate but the server assured us it was not a problem :) not only was the service outstanding but the food was great! We will definitely be back for another impromptu family night!"}
{"text":"Our visit didn't start out great as we made a reservation but a table wasn't available until nearly a half hour past the reservation time.  However, the manager took care of us by comping our first round and giving us happy prices on our food.  Super cute little place.  

The biggest drawback - parking.  I think there are literally three spaces for this restaurant.  Check out the lot south of here next to the lot marked for Ladera customers.  It's a bit of a walk but it beats stalking people you think might leave."}
{"text":"Awesome food, service, and atmosphere!  Cozy firepit on the patio.  Also dog-friendly!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My wife & I really appreciate & enjoy this local restaurant.  Food was awesome & fresh.  Ambiance can't be beat.  Recommend it highly!"}
{"text":"This little gem of a wine bar is quite frankly just perfection! The girls and I enjoyed some Spanish Rosé followed by all the carbs to cure broken hearts. It worked! We are healed! Thank you Timo!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Timo has a great menu and a wonderful staff! I am not a wine fan but the mixed drink selection is great, the atmosphere is wonderful and very intimate. The peach cobbler is a MUST!"}
{"text":"Try the brussels sprout salad. 
I LOVE brussels sprouts and this plate is to die for.
Good, friendly service.  They have a great thing going."}
{"text":"This is our favorite neighborhood spot for a fantastic dinner and ambiance. The owner Jason and staff take such good care of us every time. The food is phenomenal with huge portions for great prices. The patio is gorgeous with string lights and a huge fire pit perfect for a date or dinner with family and friends. Best place in Central Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Yummy brunch! The hollandaise sauce was really good. $12 bottomless mimosas! Service was friendly. A little slow but it was Mother's Day, so it was busy! 

The patio was lovely and spacious. And dog-friendly!

We have also been for wine and tapas. Great atmosphere for a date night!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the area and wanted some brunch, so I looked to my Yelp app and found Timo. The brunch menu had a lot of great sounding options, I went with the egg white frittata and my husband had the crab cake benedict. We both thought it was pretty cool to see the chef make our meals in the exposed kitchen with a wood fired oven. My frittata was fantastic! The eggs were super fluffy, the roasted vegetables were crunchy and flavorful, and the goat cheese and bread crumbs really tied the dish together. My husbands crab cake benedict was very good too, the crab tasted fresh, the hollandaise was perfect, and the potatoes were cooked very well. They only thing we preferred, is that typically the poached egg on benedicts have runny yokes, where as this poached egg had a solid yolk. It was just a little overcooked for our preference, but the dish was still quite good. 

I took a look at the patio and it was awesome, super welcoming setup with a fire pit and lot's of comfortable seating. I can't wait to come back with the pup when the weather gets nicer!"}
{"text":"A new, wine bar has just opened on Central Avenue. \"Timo\" occupies a storefront that used to house a firestation (Bomberos). The bruschetta was amazing. The server informed us that all breads are baked fresh in-house daily. The ambiance was lovely and the decor was contemporary. They have a unique wine list. I tried the wood fired sandwich with copa, prosciutto and brie cheese. My wife had the lemon oregano chicken. We finished dinner with the chocolate creme brulee with brandied cherries. All in all a memorable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Everything was just ok. The food was average and some dishes underwhelming. The drinks were good and the beer and wine list are excellent. Would say come here to drink, not eat."}
{"text":"This place has an excellent outdoor firepit area that you can spend hours at - and we did! The huge sitting around the firepit area allowed for lots of talk for both couples and intimate groups, all while keeping cozy warm.  The areas that were more private and away from the firepit had their own free standing patio fire stands - this would be my only complaint: our patio fire stand ran out of fuel, and the staff couldn't find another one that had fuel in it.  The drinks were really great and we spent way longer there than we had anticipated because between the sparkly patio lights and fire pit, we had a cozy spot to relax on a Friday night."}
{"text":"This is a great little place,  has very good food, and friendly waitstaff. The decor is beautiful, and the patio is so pretty.

BUT.....
 I just can't understand, in all the reviews, no one mentions the FLIES on the patio !!!!
 It was the same with Bombero's!  I don't know if it's the location or what, but I will never go back...for that one reason.  

I feel horrible saying this, because I loove to support local establishments.  But frankly, the last two times I had lunch there, I gave up, and abandoned my food  to the flies.  They are relentless!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Timo in a few months, so I was excited to come back for our twin mom's night out. When we got there, they already had our table set up.  I am usually the first one, hey, I need a drink, but this time there were a few other moms already there.  We ended up having a table for 15.  Our server, Alexis was very nice and efficient.  I shared a couple of things with one of my friends.  Timo offers a great deal on Mondays, a bottle of wine and flatbread pizza for $19, an incredible deal.  I had to share the bottle, as much as I like my wine, I can't drink a whole bottle by myself.  I had a carb overload night, it was delicious.  I had not had carbs in about 4 weeks, so I could feel the bloat before finishing my last bite, but it was so worth it.  One of my friends had a delicious cocktail made with pineapple infused vodka, muddled mint and lavender.  It was very refreshing.  Last time I was there, the menu was a lot smaller, I am happy to see a great variety and food looked delicious.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Its been almost a year since I've been to Timo and don't know why I waited so long.  It was another near perfect lunch with a delightful waiter - thanks Robbie - and one of THE BEST Bloody Mary's I've ever had.  It was garnished with asparagus, olives and shaved paremsan and it was perfectly seasoned.  YUM!  Had the Timo Trio which includes your choice of soup (went with the Butternut Squash this time), salad dressed with cranberries and bacon, and the sandwich of the day on a delicious roll.  It was a perfect day to sit out on the back patio.  Don't think I'll wait so long for my next trip."}
{"text":"Love this place, great for a date, have introduced many friends to it. Love the food, drinks, and atmosphere. Most of the staff is attentive."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence between 4 and 5 stars, but I think they deserve the 5.

The interior has a really cool ambiance and interior decoration is neat.

The staff was very nice and attentive (except when they noticed I was writing and they didn't interrupt my train of thought until I stopped writing).

The coffee was pretty good, I was hoping for a cappuccino or a latte, but their machine was out of commission. The Timo Benedict (their signature eggs Benedict) is phenomenal. The biscuit they use is soft, fluffy and crisp all at the same time. The egg was done perfectly (maybe a little less runny than I'm used to though). The hollandaise sauce was of of this world. Even the seasoned potatoes and asparagus on the side were done perfectly and really complemented the meal. The only thing I didn't get was the addition of avocado slices and a few sun-dried tomatoes, which didn't really add to the flavors of the dish. They were really good though even if they didn't feel like a part of the dish. Oh, and the thick tomato in the eggs Benedict was so fresh and thick cut, beautiful dish as well as tasty. It really hit the spot, thanks Timo! :)"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch a couple weeks ago, wanting to try some place nice, but better than the slightly overrated Corbin's.  The first things that impressed me with this place was the extensive patio.  Probably one of the better ones around, for sure.  We went inside, and initially sat down at the booth in the middle of the room... Which was so cramped that we decided to switch to a regular table.  

The ambiance is very nice here; it's difficult not to hang out a little bit after the meal.

The menu is excellent, with some creative pizzas, soups, bruschettas, and a bunch of drinks.  I always like it when a place offers creative non-alcoholic beverages, and they scored some points with their lemonade mojito and their \"Tiger Woods\" (hibiscus/lemonade).

I had the soup of the day, which was a butternut squash soup with pancetta.  This soup was amazing.  If butternut squash soup itself is not amazing enough by itself, they decided to go and add pancetta.  The soup was nice and creamy, just the way I like it.

As far as pizza is concerned, theirs is good, but not great.  I had the original tart flambee, which sounded awesome.  It turned out to be not quite as awesome as I had hoped, with toppings a little too sparse, and a crust that a little too closely resembled a cracker in texture.  It wasn't bad, but you can definitely find a better pie in the Valley for the same price.

Timo is certainly a good neighborhood restaurant, and possibly one of the best in the area.

Addendum: Went back a 2nd time and had one of the flatbread pizzas, and it was actually respectable.  Much better crust.  Make sure you get one of the flatbread pizzas, and not the thin crust."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this wine bar! My husband and I came here to celebrate our anniversary. Great wine selection, though  I ended up getting the white sangria, which was refreshing. There were so many great looking items on the menu that we had trouble choosing. We ended up getting a bruschetta sampler and a pizza to share. Both were very good. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Timo is in a really cool space - great atmosphere!

We started lunch with the Sriracha Shrimp small plate.  
It was pretty good, but not something I'd order again.

Ordered the Loaded Italian pizza - the toppings were really tasty.  The crust...ummm...not so much.  It was kind of spongy, no char, just not what I'm looking for in a wood fired pizza.

4 stars for the atmosphere and toppings, 2 stars for the crust - averages out to 3 stars."}
{"text":"We came here last night for diner & left beyond dissatisfied!! I've had this spot bookmarked for some time now so we were excited to finally make it here. I made the reservation for 7:45 for the patio & upon parking we noticed the patio was facing the parking lot which we thought odd because as you're parking you're headlights are blinding the diners!! The hostess sat us at a two top table with a high chair which was a tad cramped but I was going to let that slide. Our server Alexis greeted us & she was definitely on top of her game, she brought out our cocktails & we placed our appetizer order of the meat & cheese board. The board came out & it was fantastic with the freshly made burrata cheese & the freshly sliced meats, zero complaints... it left us excited for our entrees but unfortunately that's where it stops! My hubby got the lemon oregano chicken with fingerling potatoes, one of his faves so my poor hubby was looking forward to his dish coming. What a bomb, the potatoes were basically boiled & the chicken was just ehh... so so bland & minus that perfectly cooked skin you expect with a rotisserie chicken! He left half a plate & yet turned down a take away box, enough said! I went with my fave butternut squash soup & Parmesan crusted scallops which is also my favorite!! The soup was some of the worst, when you lift the spoon the soup was like this gelatin texture versus the velvet texture that your expecting & there was no hint of the nutmeg that you'd be looking for, yes please take my dish away. I then had the scallops with mushrooms on top, the mushrooms were great but the scallops were beyond over cooked yet I chose not to say anything because I wasn't in the mood to order a replacement!! Alexis did insist that I choose something in place of the soup so I chose a crab cake, I know huge gamble but come on who's cooking back there... either cook or hire someone who can!!! The crab cake was served sitting atop a thickly sliced beef steak tomato, looked great yet the tomato was ice cold which completely brought the temp of my hot crab cake to a lukewarm... the crab cake tasted good with the lumps of crab but I'm not going to eat a barely hot crab cake when I'm expecting it to be hot!! At this time I asked Alexis if she could just box it up & bring hubby the check. Mind you with all of this going on it would have been nice to see a manager but that wasn't the case, Alexis did come back & said she had some of our meal comped because of the unsatisfactory entrees so that was much appreciated & she was rightfully compensated for her exceptional service yet we would never ever go back there. Let's face it if you can't get it right the first time why am I going to gamble for you to screw up our whole meal again!! Go figure the one thing we loved, the meat & cheese board involved zero cooking!!! So kudos to the person that prepared the board but whomever did the entrees has some serious fine tuning to do!!"}
{"text":"They are lucky they are getting 3-stars after my Xmas eve visit yesterday.  Thus had a been a fave spot of mine for couple of months since a friend introduced me to it. Killer items: Foie gras w/fig jam ($16) enough to share with 3 people. The wood-fired lamb chops ($9) and some other notable items. Anyway the service was not up to par last evening and the GM never acknowledged my company event though we were one of two parties in the whole place.  Being it's Xmas eve don't you think a simple hello thanks for joining us is the proper thing to do? I am very disgusted with the bartender/server that was on duty as well. Completely unprofessional and we felt that no one wanted to be there. hey if your advertising half off your menu until 6 P.M. you might want to make one of your only guests feel welcome. I can tell you that I am not sure I will be visiting in the near future due to the lack of welcoming and professionalism here."}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place was the timo bread. Sangria was watered down, bruschetta was horrible, pizza was bland, and the service was atrocious. Definitely wont be coming back! Did i mention it took 20 mins to get the check?!"}
{"text":"This was an excellent experience!  Our waiter Nathan was perfect in following up & didn't ever make us ferl tudhed. Tge good was beyond what I expected.  Can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place for dinner it seemed to have such promise but our party left disappointed. 

We sat on the patio since it was such a nice night out. Half of the tables were plastic card tables and chairs with table clothes. It was a strange contrast to the other patio furniture and indoor decor. Our service was ok. We had to request a refill of the water bottle twice and the waitress just seem to agree with is but not really know the ins and outs. 

As for the food our party had the lemon chicken, braised short ribs, crab cakes and lasagne with sausage. Only the lemon chicken got a somewhat thumbs up. It only had some slightly burnt areas and was a little too lemony. The braised short ribs were moderately burnt not that it mattered because it was so salty there was no taste beyond that. I sent mine home with my friend to give to her husband, maybe he could eat it. The lasagna had potential if the entire top layer wasn't a piece of charcoal. It was nice to discover that under the excess sauce and sausage. Inedible. My friend then asked for the crab cake appetizer. That got an ok as well with only slightly burnt edges. Because we were still hungry we decided to order dessert, chocolate creme brûlée with brandies cherries. It was good I think but over half was made of cherries. I thought they would be on top or on the side, but we're in the dish. The side of bread was delicious, which made us think we should have stuck with pizza. 

Doubtful any of us will return since there are so many other options to try."}
{"text":"Took my fiancé here tonight for a lovely Valentine's Day dinner. Masterful ambience and decor. Outside of that it was pretty much a bust at Timos. It took about 20 before someone came over to take her order. Then 30 min to get our appetizer. 45 min later still no second course and our server all but vanished. With nothing but a half a glass of champagne and a small appetizer, we finally decided we couldn't take it anymore. We found ourselves at The Spoken Wheel down the street for some quick delicious food before starting the rest of our night. 

I'll try the place again in the future. Hopefully they can deliver on all of the great reviews on here."}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience there tonight.  To put this in perspective, I rarely say that about any restaurant.   We had a Groupon and went based on good reviews on this site.  Four of us went to dinner there.

- Three of us ordered glasses of red wine.  Wine was warm in all three glasses and had rather skimpy pours.  The bottle we ordered later was good temperature though.

- Ordered Bruschetta and the Cheese plate.  They made a mistake on the order.  No big deal and sent back the order.  However, 30 seconds later someone other than our server (the manager?) brought us the very same plate we just sent back.  Sent that back.  30 seconds later the waiter shows up and proceeds to tell us what we ordered-- which he had wrong.  Once we got the right order they were good (although-- the bruschetta bread was not toasted all that well).

- Egg Plant Lasagna, Short Ribs and Margherita Flat bread were good.

- I ordered the prosciutto, copa and brie sandwich which was listed under the WOOD FIRED SANDWICHES.  I got a cold sandwich with mediocre bread. Yes, I should have sent it back and would have if either the manager or our waiter would have showed up at some point after bringing us our orders. By the way, the place was mostly empty at this point.

- As noted above, we had a Groupon with a value of approx $175 which included 4 drinks, 2 appetizers, 4 \"entrees\" and 1 dessert.  We had those and ordered a bottle of wine on top of that bringing the bill to approx $181 w/out subtracting the value of  the Groupon.   Waiter brings the bill, which should have been approx $6 (after subtracting the Groupon value).  We explained several times to him that it should be approx $6, not $181.  Our guests were going to cover the difference plus the tip on their credit card.  What charge comes back?  You guessed it $181.  Even after correcting the mistake, it was approx $15 (assume the diff. was taxes).  

- \"Free\" valet is really not necessary given the parking is all of about 20 feet from the door.  However, the valet attendant was very nice and had our cars ready even before we got out there.

- Even after all the screw ups, our server boasting about how great everything is and fishing for a big tip we got no apologies for any of the mistakes they made.

Needless to say, I will never go to this place again. This experience could be an anomaly, but I'd be surprised if they're still in business 6 months from now."}
{"text":"Escargot, spicy salami pizza, kids cheese pizza, chicken wings with mango dipping sauce, prosciutto with fresh mozzarella on baguettes and a wonderful Merlot paired well with the charming atmosphere and fantastic service! A couple loved the peach cobbler so much that they sent us one!"}
{"text":"After eating here a few times, I have finally given up on trying to like it. The food is ok - nothing special. I loved the patio but they had a bee problem when I was there. Not sure if that was common or if it was a fluke. I never want a local place to go out of business so I hope others don't agree with me."}
{"text":"I was so sad when Bomberos closed, but so excited when Timo opened in its place.  I absolutely love this patio...so relaxing and a great place to enjoy a lazy Sunday drinking sangria or whatever other tasty cocktail they mix up for you.  Love that they offer happy hour prices on Sundays too...bonus!"}
{"text":"The most amazing Brussels sprouts salad I've ever had tonight. Delicious mustard dressing and sweet dried fruits and nuts, I'll be back to try more. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great patio ambiance. Monday Date Night Special is a bonus! Fire pit, lit mesquite trees, relaxed seating, friendly staff - fabulous!"}
{"text":"I really loved this quaint little wine bar. The atmosphere is very modern and they have a large back patio area. It's located on Central and the food is delicious. They have wood fire pizzas, yummy salads and delicious sangria by the pitcher. They have a cool happy hour menu from 3 to 6 PM and all day on Sunday. Check it out very good"}
{"text":"I like Timo! We went for restaurant week, but added lots of other things to our order, and really enjoyed it. We had to sit outside but it was quite comfortable on the patio. If we have a few more cool nights this spring, you should check it out.
We had the restaurant week fare including lamb chops ( the guys LOVED them!), bruschetta, short ribs ( yum), and nice cold white wine.  Someone had the chocolate creme brûlée and really liked it.  Best spinach artichoke dip I've had in a long time! (Sorry, that's a little out of order!)  OH well!"}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars I would. The ambience was deflated. I found the food to be quite shallow and pedantic. The service was to be quite honest utterly unacceptable. I wouldn't feed the burrito to even a third world country. Worst Mother's Day experience.. Ever.."}
{"text":"My experience here was excellent.  This was my second visit and both trips have been great.  Service was good and you get 10% off for checking in. You can't beat that! 

I love the mimosas for a brunch treat! We had the bruschetta, the lemon, ricotta and basil is amazi¥ng.  We also had the Kale Cesar salad which is the strangest, yet delicious,  salad I've had. (It's dried) 

The atmosphere is nice and relaxing with some great music playing in the background.  There was a party on the patio and they had a fire pit going for warmth.  I would come back to have a party out there. Plus, the patio is dog friendly."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Food is spectacular and the atmosphere is cozy! The Bruschetta ingredients are so fresh! Wood oven pizza wonderful! Nathan was very fantastic and knows his stuff!"}
{"text":"Delicious white prosciutto pizza, great service, beautiful ambiance, and good wine!  I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, but service was terrible. Probably the worst we have experienced in a while.  Thursday night, not busy at all -but the waitress took 45 minutes to come back for our food order after the initial drinks order. We had to get someone else who worked there to get her attention. The food came out 35 minutes after that. Not sure what took so long to make a pizza and a prosciutto sandwich. Were they butchering the pig out back for the prosciutto?  This was not our first time here, but no one at our table would probably be back."}
{"text":"Such a cute, quaint place. Everything I had was unbelievably delicious. The pizzas are made to perfection and the meatballs soaked in sauce are really something else. I will definitely be back and recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying Timo's is the place to be! I love it there! Im 20 minutes away and the lil drive is worth it! Every- one to two times a week, I'm there! The staff is great! Especially the bartender AMY! I enjoy her great service and wonderful, cheerful personality! She makes my day by having me leave with a smile! One of the cooks which his name is DIEGO, knows exactly what Im going to order and never disappointed! I love the food and always plenty leftovers for me to take home! Please stop by and check it out, you won't be disappointed! :-)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Timo. It's new, so I've only been there once so far, but I can't wait to go back. I tried the Brie soup, and it was amazing. The flatbreads (pizzas?) were delicious too. We had one with crushed peppers, truffle oil, and 3 cheeses...I think. The item listed on the menu was slightly different than what we received, but it was delicious nonetheless.

Small and intimate restaurant up front, with very nice ambiance. Great bar too. More seating outside in the back. A place you want to go and hang out at for a while, maybe try a Hendricks Gin. Take your time, lounge, order plenty, enjoy...that's what I'll be doing next time I'm at Timo anyway."}
{"text":"Quaint little wine bar! Wonderful spot to pop in and enjoy a glass of wine and some jazz music... a very relaxing bistro with a sweet outside patio where we enjoyed fresh baked bread with citrus butter and pesto. We also ordered the meatballs which were amazing! PIzza was fresh and  and the service was great!!! Monday is date night... pizza, wine and music all reasonably priced. Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Extensive wood-fired oven pizza menu, and stellar wine list. Perfect for an intimate date or a night out with friends."}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio setting and our waitress Michelle had great food and wine suggestions.   Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm still a HUGE fan of this place, but I ordered a margarita pizza with sausage on my most recent visit and I was not impressed. The crust was good - that's about it. Besides that it barely had any sauce or cheese but was completely covered with huge pieces of basil and large chunks of garlic. The sausage pieces were also huge chunks and hard to eat. Sadly, this is the first menu item I've been disappointed with here. I'd skip it."}
{"text":"Delicious everything. Cocktails were excellent especially for a wine bar. Siracha shrimp was awesome. Timo Royale-tasty! Went on a Saturday and they had a DJ playing smooth jams in the dog friendly patio. Hope to come back sometime. (Out of towner)"}
{"text":"Trying this place after a few recommendations from friends. Service was attentive but not personalized. We shared a breakfast sandwich and a flatbread. Both were great and we're of good value. All and all, pretty happy with our visit. I would have ordered drinks if they had happy hour brunch specials."}
{"text":"Best escargot in the Valley by far! Great appetizers and entrees. Their mixed drinks are a little on the weak side, though...don't bother with them. Has a hip local neighborhood vibe. Patio is comfy and cozy any cool night of the week.  Prices are pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Okay I love the food and the patio is awesome.

Service?  O that. That which was missing on our late lunch today? One friend says \"incompetent\" one says \"indifferent\"' but I think it has more to do with poor kitchen management and no awareness of what is happening on the patio or inside the restaurant. 

Here's why:

1. When the first two of us arrived (after the lunch rush) and the patio was mostly empty, we looked toward sitting on the lounge furniture directly across from the patio entrance to welcome a friend and because it looked like a nice place to sit under the trees and no direct sun. Your server said - well I think this is the best I can do for you and steered us to a wobbly 2 person table in the middle of the walk area. When I mentioned we had at least one more person coming. she said - I can get another table to put right here.

2. The kitchen manager? ( Young gentleman) was visible inside the restaurant but he did not come out on the patio. We all watched as a homeless man wandered in and out of the all the cars in the parking area ambushing all your customers as they left from the last of the lunch group.  Finally this homeless man wandered into your patio and started approaching the first group sitting directly inside the patio in the soft furniture.  A few awkward moments later when your kitchen manager(?) FINALLY looks outside and sees us looking at him he comes out and THEN he sees the homeless man now making his way to the second table.

3. Our third party had arrived and we had to call to the server to please come take our order. We also had to ask for an additional glass and to order a bottle of wine. That took awhile as she wandered back and forth to a couple of other table bussing and wrapping things up until she finally returned with water and a menu.

4. We waited over 25 minutes for bruschetta after having to again call the server to take the order. The food was taking forever and now we were the only other group here except for the two men who had to talk  with homeless man near the gate. We finally found the server and asked where.our food was....another 5 minutes wait ...and she returned to say there was a problem with the printer...?   Huh?

Okay the food was great - and I love the patio and it was quite and lovely outside but someone needs to be paying attention to what is going on.  Your kitchen staff was in the dining room folding napkins and making prep for dinner service.  Your kitchen manager was hanging out and visiting with them The server went in and out of the kitchen alot.  NO ONE bothered to look outside at the customers to see if anyone needed anything.

I hope someone in management reads this. Alot of red flags in the service staff."}
{"text":"Timo has consistently offered a great wine choices and excellent service. The patio can use a little clean up but the restaurant is excellent. Food was well presented and served in an timely manor, all tasty and as described. Butternut Soup was a favorite. I must state we had a lovely server who allowed our family to truly enjoy dinner in a relaxed atmosphere never feeling rushed even though it was a busy dinner hour.  We will return!  Ciao K"}
{"text":"In response to my review the owner contacted me, thanked me for my honesty and has changed the method of preparation for the chicken and now serves plump juicy chicken in salads and sandwiches.

How Cool is that! I hope to try Timo again.

 4-5 stars might be pending."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Timo for quite some time, so we met up with some friends this past week.  Food and atmosphere both deserve 4 stars-I like the vibe and ambiance and they have a very inviting patio that I hope to enjoy when the weather cools down a bit.  We all enjoyed pizzas-my husband got the short rib pizza which was a delightful change from the norm-a bunch of random ingredients that you wouldn't think go together but actually work on this pizza.  I had the pesto which was very good as well-I like that their were actual pine nuts on the pizza-I am really into trying new things, especially since there are a plethora of pizza places here in Phoenix.  
That being said, this place is not just pizza.  They have salads, sandwiches as well as a few entree selections-one of which sounded divine, that being crab cake Benedict.  I might have to try that one day.  They also have an extensive tapas menu that had me wishing I had been hungrier.
The loss of 1 star is due to the fact that we really did not have good service.  Our waitress was inattentive and not helpful when asking for menu and cocktail suggestions.  She rarely checked on us, especially being a summer Wednesday evening when it was not busy.  
I still plan on returning though.  I hope the lack of service was a one time thing."}
{"text":"Well, I hate when I'm the outlier to otherwise really good reviews, because it means we probably just caught them on a bad night. That being said, we won't ever be back. Went last Sunday evening for my birthday, service was terrible. And I mean not just normal terrible but I thought about leaving less than 15% terrible which is just unheard of for ex servers like us. Food was only mediocre.

The first of our party of four arrived and was seated on the patio at 5:55. The patio is amazing of course with all the nice couches etc, unless you are sat at a little plastic fold up table with folding chairs like we were. The rest of us arrived at 6 and finally at 6:10 our server came by for the first time and took our drink order. We still didn't even have waters yet. Our server was clearly swamped, and seemed responsible for the entire patio which was full. We would have to flag her down for every interaction going forward, and then wait forever for whatever we ordered to arrive.

I started with a glass of sangria, it was okay. We had the cheese board and the bruschetta, they were okay. We had a couple of pizzas, they were okay. The food was noticeably worse than, Postino for example. My companions all thought the pizza was pretty good, but they are wrong. :)

So yeah, I'm sure it's better than the experience we had there and I don't feel like blathering on about just how bad the service was that night, but I won't be back. Oh another thing, they cut their bruschetta into 3 slices instead of 4. Our little group of 4 are regulars at Postino who of course do 4 slices each so that was pretty tilting. :)"}
{"text":"Cool patio, unfortunately rained while we were there, good food"}
{"text":"Incredible! We were able to choose our own seats when we visited last night. We were lucky enough to sit next to a beautiful fire pit with a live musician playing acoustic variations of fantastic songs. The service was great, our water Marcus knew every single beer and wine on the menu, and the food was pretty damn good. Got a small pizza, and the gf got a beet salad, both of which were fantastic. Prices weren't that bad either. Live music every Thursday! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Everything was phenomenal. The patio out back has the perfect ambiance for an intimate evening. Inside is bright and constantly moving. 

The Three Cheese Flatbread has a mouthful of magic in every bite. Even the bread with pesto and butter was the best little loaf of bread I've ever eaten. The Chicken BLT is highly reccomended for the bacon lover in your life. The owner even stopped by our table to say hi.

I love this place. You should too.

EDIT: Oh man, I almost forgot to write about their potato chips. They are kettle chips, and I can't place the flavor (Spicy Tangy BBQ-y Limey) except that they were so delicious I wanted to take a truckload home with me."}
{"text":"One of my favorite hidden treasures- Delicious food and great atmosphere.  Sat outside, listened to a fabulous guy play the guitar and sing a few songs that brought back many memories.
This is a definite must!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Timo Wine Bar today. Excellent, great atmosphere and setting. Only thing that was wrong was the weather, cloudy, cold and a bit of rain. But that was OK, inside the restaurant everything was just fine. Had the Calabrese Salad, it was just enough and very tasty. The food I saw coming out of the kitchen also looked great and I will have to go back and try a few other of the dishes. Recommend Timo Wine Bar to you all."}
{"text":"We have been here several times.  The food is good but the service is always lacking.  Today's experience took the cake.  We arrived with my family (5 of us) at 11 am for lunch.  We waited 15 minutes in the parking lot for them to open.  At 11 am we began to go inside and the cook started to shake his head no as we walked towards the door.  He said \"i don't know what you are doing, I don't have a server\".  He was rude and when we asked what he wanted us to do since they were open and we were there to have lunch.  He said rudely, \"I don't know\".  He then walked away.  We said well I guess we will find somewhere else to eat.   

There were a million better ways for him to handle this.   He should have welcomed us in and apologized for his server not being there and maybe offered us a drink while we wait.  I suppose this is the reason he is a cook and not in the front of the house.  As we were leaving the \"server\" had finally arrived.  He said you guys can come back now, I can serve you.  Well, a little too late.  The damage had been done and we were not happy and probably will never go back there.  

I decided to call and speak to a manager when I got home to make him aware of our experience.  The manager answered the phone.  I told him what had happened and he said he was actually the \"server\" that arrived as we were entering our cars to leave and he had told my husband we could come back in.  I explained the cook was very rude to us and the damage had been done.  He said he was sorry but didn't seem to affected he lost 5 customers.  

I would not recommend this place and we will not be going back.  Timo's is poorly managed and run.  If they plan to not have anyone but the cook there at opening then they need to teach him some customer service skills."}
{"text":"I've been to timo a few times now and it never disappoints! consistently great food (particularly the short rib flatbread, sangria & the specials on Sunday's). The manager, Jason creates a welcoming environment that you can spend hours on the patio!"}
{"text":"1st time here and I'm thoroughly impressed!! Unbelievable atmosphere. Spectacular hospitality. Ask for Nathan, he's out of this world. Goes above and beyond!! Couldn't have asked for a more positive and enjoyable evening. Thank you!! Again.....Thoroughly impressed!!! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Two pals and I went for Sunday brunch - thank goodness that's still a thing - and were really surprised to see the place was pretty bare. Not a lot of business on Sundays in December? They took my reservation but probably didn't need to, because we were one of a handful of people there. That said, this place hasn't changed their food menu in years and that is a very good thing, because the entire menu is fantastic. I come ALL the way from Flagstaff for the food - my favorites are crab cake benedict and the handful of bruschetta options. I might be an easy sell on benedicts, but there's is really top notch. Perfectly made, everything is fresh and comes out hot. The seafood on all the dishes is always fresh and never tastes fishy.  Try these bruschetta varieties: with apples and fig, salmon with creme freche and the roasted tomatoes. We get those three just about every time. 

I wasn't a huge fan of the white wines this time around, and had to try a few. The top pinot grigio (Riondo?) was a little watery tasting. 

Thanks to the girls there for putting up with us meandering through three courses and coffee. :)"}
{"text":"Okay! Cant wait to come back here. David provided excellent service and made amazing suggestions. The bacon wrapped dates are to die for. They have a cute little patio with a DJ and a fire pit. Overall the food was great, the service excellent, and I enjoyed the unique vibes."}
{"text":"Wood-fired pizzas, rustic wine bar, very quaint patio with perfect ambience of perfect lighting, plants, very pleasant music was a perfect spot for a second date. They offer a nice selection of beer and wine. Food and transportation specialist was very attentive even though they were short-handed."}
{"text":"Timo bread is so fluffy! Dangerous for sure. The patio was nice and cool with the misters. Sam had all the inside info on the bruschettas and wine. Loud inside with the bachelorette party, quiet and very pleasant outside."}
{"text":"This place participated in Restaurant Week.  We try to go to at least one every year.  This year we chose Timo.

First tip, don't use Yelp to book because only the manager sees that.  Apparently today was his day off, so no one knew we had a reservation.  Really not a good system they have there.  Fortunately there was a table large enough for our party.  When I tried to call for a reservation (before using Yelp), no one answered and the message I left was not returned.  Even now, no call-back.

We all ended up going for the Restaurant Week menu options. I started with the lamb chop appetizer.  It was pretty chewy, the flavor nothing special.  The presentation was well-done.  Next for me was the short ribs.  Sort of like a really good beef stew.  Looked fancy, but wasn't.  Still very good.  Dessert was Creme brûlée.  It was very nice, though I didn't like the cherries.  They were too strong and overpowered the chocolate.

I sampled what my wife ordered as well.  The bruschetta not very good.  The bread was too chewy, so instead of just biting a piece you had to pull and tear.  So the toppings fell off.  And the flavors were OK, but not \"wow\".  I'm comparing to Vintage 95 when I say this.  Her salmon was fine.  Didn't really \"wow\" me either.  

They are pricey, which is fine.  But \"pricey\" needs to \"wow\", and this was hit and miss.  Some things were good (like my short ribs), some were just OK.  They would kick Chili's butt, and at the same price as Chili's I'd probably go 5 stars here.  But a place like this is holding itself up to a higher standard, and they just didn't quite make it.  A solid 3 stars.  Maybe 3.5.  They are not Vintage 95.

The ambiance is trendy/hip."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. I come here almost weekly for either their date night sunday lasagna and wine or Monday pizza and wine.

I recommend sitting outside by the fire under the beautiful strung lights in the trees. Or sit inside during happy hour and drink one of their many fantastic drinks.  For such a highly romantic place the price on the bill doesn't break the bank like other high end places either."}
{"text":"I came to Timo for my birthday last week after hearing rave reviews about it from a few friends of mine. I met up with the fabulous Jennifer T. and I was so happy to check this place out!

I like any place that I get to walk in through a back door. I passed through the very chill looking patio area first, another plus in my book. Plenty of outdoor seating that looked dangerously inviting once this hot hot heat cools off. Inside was intimate, but with the large windows, it wasn't dark and depressing. Like your own little happy wine bar world.

They have an amazing wood burning oven. Normally, that itself is plenty good enough, but then there's the food that comes out of that wonderful oven. I only tried the spinach and artichoke dip, which was the best I have ever had! It didn't have a pool of oil (first time for everything!), it was so fresh, and I really appreciated seeing the bread sliced fresh right in front of us, since we were sitting at the bar. I saw several other things (flatbread)  come out of that oven, and I will have to go back to try them! Everything smelled delicious and was presented with a touch of class without being pretentious. I was also very intrigued by the eggplant dip which is apparently \"better than baba!\" 

Now for the drinks. Holy cow. I've been drinking a few years now, so safe to say, I've tried many, many drinks. Or so I thought. Coconut mojito anyone!? Made with Ciroc Coconut vodka!  As tasty as mojitos are, I don't get a long well with rum, so vodka was a pleasant surprise, and the coconut just brought the mmmmmazing factor to a whole new level. I also tried the white sangria, another 5 stars. Great wine list too- Apothic Red is one of a few reds I like, and they have it!  

The staff was top notch as well. I arrived shortly before a shift change, and both bartenders were personable and hard working, and truly seemed to enjoy what they were doing. I'm pretty bad with names unfortunately, or I would love to mention them.

I can't wait to go back! For drinks and food! I think I'd even go alone for lunch if I didn't have any company!"}
{"text":"I had only been to Timo once before for drinks, but finally had the opportunity to go for a favorite Yelper's birthday brunch a few months ago.

We had two large tables, and the servers were able to keep up beautifully.  The mimosa flight was a great deal with glasses of orange, grapefruit, and cranberry.  The grapefruit was my favorite.  Damn it!  I'm not supposed to have grapefruit.  Oh well, it was worth it.  I also hesitatingly ordered the crab cake benedict.  The last time I tried this at another restaurant, the crab cake tasted more like a fish patty.  Not at Timo, it was perfect.  Well, the yoke was maybe a tad overcooked, but that's okay with me.

I would happily return for brunch again!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place I'm definitely returning to. Very unique in its own right. A must for dinner, early to mid evening. The setting is a little darker on the back patio but it's too pretty not to sit out there. Very hip and very romantic feel. I think it's an old firehouse. They offer two unisex restrooms that are very clean. There's a big firepit on the back patio that I think you can reserve. Oh... Their food?? Yeah let me get to that :) 

Their bruschetta I was NOT expecting. They're huge!! We tried all of them and all of them were amazing. Especially the one with tomato, brie, and olives. Yummm. I asked our waitress, who took a little while to get to us but it was a bit busy, what light sweeter red wine she recommended and said to get one of the light Pinot Noir's. Can't remember the name... Bridge Water maybe? I got the Brie Soup, which was a bit Salty but soo delicious. My date ordered the Crab Cake Benedict and that is a MUST try. I was jealous. 

And. The. Chocolate. Creme Brulee.

Good, fun service? Check! 
Yummy drinks? Check! 
Delicious food? Check! 
Delicious sweets? Check! 
Music? Very good and very fitting! 
Pretty fair pricing? Check! (Except maybe the wine, $9 a glass to start is a bit up there...)"}
{"text":"My husband made a reservation for our anniversary.  We were seating between a box and the DJ - not a great seat. We were then ignored by the wait staff for 20 minutes! No water - no nothing! We eventually just walked out. Ambiance seemed lovely. Too bad it did not work out...We went somewhere else and had a fabulous time!"}
{"text":"Okay, seriously... Everything I had here was awesome. This place made me enjoy eggplant and asparagus! These are 2 things i do not typically enjoy... Either my taste buds are growing up or Timo is an evil genius.  The eggplant dip is served with fantastic crostini, tomatoes, mixed olives and goat cheese for toppings. Tried 3 of their bruschettas and they were maybe the best i've had, right up there with Postino's delicious concoctions. Two of us at the table had flatbreads, the Margherita and Pancetta. Both were amazing. They manage to make the perfect crust that is crispy but soft and dough-like. I even reheated the 2nd half of mine the next day and it was still delicious. Oh, lets not forget the cocktails! I had a Day-drinker... It was like a mojito with grapefruit juice. Incredibly refreshing and very drinkable. I sampled martinis and sangria around the table and they were all top-notch. 
My only issue was the floors are a bit slippery with the type of slate-like flooring. My girlfriend almost slipped and apparently the week before had witnessed a server go down pretty hard after slipping on the floor here. 
Anywho, I am super excited to get back here for round two... I need to try those lamb chops and cheese plate while burying my face in a couple glasses of wine. I'll be back and i'll tread carefully!"}
{"text":"The Timo Benedict is delicious. I was a little disappointed with the service. There was a single bartender attempting to do both bar tending while also serving tables. Consequently, service was poor. I will go back because of the food but I hope Timo rectifies this quickly."}
{"text":"Love the patio here!! Great for a glass of wine by the fire! Love the whole atmosphere! The fig app is my absolute favorite... I'm kinda obsessed. Love the pizzas... My second favorite is the Brie and prosciutto sandwich. It's perfection with the olive tapenade."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic-really.  I've been there a few times for brunch (mimosa flight anyone?) and a couple times for dinner and I've always been pleased.  The service is great-LOVE the atmosphere and patio-it's very close to North Mountain so it's a must when coming down from a Sunday morning hike-and it's pretty close to the canal-if you're feeling like a bike ride to brunch.  My favorite is the egg-white frittata-I always want to try other things but this is so good I can't say no to it!  For dinner-the sandwiches are phenomenal....and a fantastic wine selection!!!!"}
{"text":"Dope atmosphere - dim lit inside/outside - great place to take a girl for a romantic vibe - good wine - staff had great product knowledge - good pricing - I'm a fan"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here on a date and I gotta say this place blew me away. Not only was the patio cute but they had heaters (a big plus for me in Arizona winters) so we sat down and got immediate service. We started off with smoked salmon on corn cakes. They were sublime! Then had their homemade bread with pesto and honey butter. My boyfriend got the eggplant lasagna with sausage and I got their special which was a steak in some kind of reduction  and blu cheese. I highly recommend this place if you have the money because it was a bit pricey. All in all I loved it!!"}
{"text":"Just ended the evening tonight (5-1-14), at Timo's for a retirement party and the staff and food was excellent!  We rented out the restaurant for a party of 30+ and everyone couldn't get over this jewel on north Central Ave.  We originally wanted the patio but that was booked for a reception.  The inside worked perfectly, however, with 3-4 waitresses attending to the guests, serving the hor d'oeuvres and taking drink orders.  A very nice and special night off the beaten path-thank you to Michelle,  Samantha and the rest of the Timo's team for making the evening so enjoyable and memorable!  Greg, Genine and Taylor."}
{"text":"Here are a few of my favorite Timo things:
~ The brunch flat bread ($10): bacon, eggs, burrata - the crust has the perfect, ever-so-slight salty crunch that is perfectly complimented by the toppings. I would eat this for breakfast, lunch OR dinner!
~ The mimosa flight: a steal at $9 with samples of orange, grapefruit and cranberry & St. Germain. Shockingly (to me anyway), my favorite is the grapefruit!
~ La fin du monde golden (beer -9% alc.) $6 here, now also found in my fridge at home! Thanks for the introduction!!
~ The day drinker ($9) a magical grapefruit flavored adult beverage and the Irish Sour ($): trust, don't be afraid of the egg white. ($6 at Happy Hour!)
~ That they're always cooking up different things in the wood fired oven - from bacon and eggs to fish and lasagna! 

These are just a few... there's a lot to love about Timo!"}
{"text":"Great small place with a nice ambiance for a sit down with friends and having a bottle, or two, of wine. Staff is super friendly and very welcoming. Not a place for pizza in my opinion. Their pizza does not have great flavor and a very small amount of meet overall in any pizza you get. We tried a few and if you must get pizza, the Italian is the best choice in my opinion. The food here was not my favorite. If you're looking for a nice wine place to enjoy with friends or that special someone, this is a good choice!"}
{"text":"Perfect perfect perfect.  I went here again last night with friends and it was even better than last time.  We got a table on the patio this time and it is every bit as pretty and comfy as I had hoped.  They have a mister system that cools the place off, and the lights in the trees are really lovely.  We started with the artisan cheese tray, which was delicious and had a great non-standard selection of cheeses along with nuts, dried and fresh fruit, and crackers.  One friend had the brie soup, which he said was great (I didn't try it because I was afraid I wouldn't stop).  He also had the beet salad, which I did try, and which was delicious.  This guy is over 6 ft tall and about 170 lbs soaking wet and he eats like a horse.  We had a couple of bottles of the Tempranillo from Spain, which was very nice.  A couple of us had the salmon, which is beautifully smoked with cedar.  You can really taste the smokiness, and the accompaniments were perfect.  A couple of us had the crab cakes with poached egg, which they loved, and no one at the table left a speck of food on their plates.  One of the guys had a flatbread pizza and said it was perfect - not too much cheese and just the right consistency for the flatbread.  The waitress was sweet and attentive, and when we asked them to turn down the mister for us they turned it off, which was kind of awesome.  I am a little sad now, because my job here is only for another two months and then I go somewhere else for awhile, so I only have two more months to go here."}
{"text":"What a great atmosphere. 5 stars there.  If you want good food. Great drinks. And a great patio. This is your spot. We decided to check this place out for happy hour and were blown away by the ambiance. I am a person who always looks for a great layout at any restaurant I visit so I'm always pleased when I score 1.  

Arrived around 4 p.m. and found the place abandoned. Awesome. First pick on the beautiful patio. I chose to sit in the very back so that I could enjoy the people watching as I drank. I recommend this.  For wine I ordered a few different Cabs as I was very much in a red mood.  All great and our server Michelle was awesome and kept the drinks flowing.  Large enough wine selection so choose wisely. 

We ordered the loaded Italian pizza, salmon corn cakes, and wood fired wings. The Italian Pizza is a keeper. Will order that next time. Perfect char. The salmon corn cake and wood fired wings were just okay but not terrible. I felt the wings were lacking some flavor. And I wasn't a huge fan of the capers on the salmon. But still good dishes. Pizza is where it's at. 

Again go here for the ambiance. Romantic. Intimate. And overall pretty damn awesome. Sit on the patio and enjoy the wine. I will be back. My word. Recommended."}
{"text":"To start off, the owner has asked me twice to come back and try the place again. I have to say, I really appreciate that the owner takes that much of an interest in their customers. So kudos to the owner!

My wife and I went back again a couple of weeks ago for brunch. I had some more of the White Sangria, and it's still ridiculously amazingly delicious. If you go, this is a must-try.

My wife and I started off with the Brie Soup. This, is delicious. I wish I would have ordered this the first time. This soup, with the sangria alone are two things worth coming back for.

I had a flat bread again that had bacon, fig, caramelized onion and cheese. The dough was much better this time. The bacon was all over the flat bread (nothing wrong with that!), the onions were good as well. The fig was also really good though it was placed on 1 small spot on each slice of the flat bread. The bacon is salty and needs the fig. Easy fix, though, since I just used the bacon to spread the fig around the top of the flat bread. (yum)

My wife had ordered a Small Plate that had salmon on it, and she loved it. 

The food was much, much better than my first visit. Combine that with the fact the owners personally reached out to me and asked me to try it again, and I must say I was very pleasantly surprised. Any owner that reaches out to dissatisfied customers and tries to remedy the situation, will only ever improve their restaurant and food as time goes on. 

We will be back most definitely for the Brie soup (and sangria! seriously...have the sangria) and to try some more of Timo's food."}
{"text":"They have an awesome outdoor area with wonderful food and a great wine selection!"}
{"text":"I've loved this place even when it was *Shhhhh* Bomberos. But it's even better now. I like to come here for celebratory occasions and even more for date night. The food is fresh,  thoughtful,  well prepared and served up with superb libations. Some staff are more personable than others but all are good."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time yesterday, and lets just say I'm pretty much in love! The place is so beautiful and well decorated both inside and out. I came here with a friend for some dessert and drinks but I will definitely be back for a dinner date.

Our server Emily was awesome! She greeted us immediately, was very attentive and friendly, and had a beautiful smile on her face the whole time. She suggested and deliciously described the Creme brulee with cherries. Not only was it delicious but she torched the thing in front of our table! - How cool!

Awesome wine selection and happy hour deals, plus some decent craft beers on the menu too."}
{"text":"Very pleased with my recent visit, returning to Timo...alas, with serious food critics, my kids!  On a prior visit, I was less confident.  Not anymore!

We wandered into pizza/wine night, and enjoyed a very delicious, value-packed pizza and bottle of Tempranilo on this gorgeous, lightly windy evening.  As I was the only adult (drinker), staff was very accommodating in corking my wine btl, following eating, for me to finish at a later time. Bonus!

Definitely going back soon, I hear the lasagna night as well is quite yum! Nice job, Timo :)"}
{"text":"This place is too far from downtown to be at all convenient.  Still, I have a friend who lives and works nearby and we have met at Timo's several times.  This is a nice, quiet place that is both relaxed and welcoming.  The menu is not extensive, but the food is good, fresh and somewhat unique.  

The restaurant is good any time of the year.  It has a nice, large patio for when the weather is nice and the closed portion of the restaurant is good all year-round, but particularly inviting in winter when the pizza oven and the fireplace can be used to their full effect."}
{"text":"Love love love Timo Wine Bar! Anytime I am back in Phoenix, my family and I often walk over as it just five minutes from my parents house. Had brunch here on Mother's Day and ordered the Timo Benedict. Perfect amount of food that was well prepared and delicious. 

The outdoor patio is great for a drink in the evening. Lets face it - not many of us want to sit outside in the middle of the afternoon in the blazing Arizona sun during the summer. However, Timo's patio is covered with trees and umbrellas, reducing the insane heat and making the dining experience more enjoyable. 

Inside is cool and trendy. Small, but charming. The west wall is made out of Garage Doors which are opened up on cool afternoons and evenings."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great!!! 
It had comfortable seating which is really important when you're just going to hang out and have a bottle of wine and catch up with friends. There was ample parking and the server was prompt, courteous, and had personality. 
I felt like they had a wide range of choices on the menu. I had the Brie soup which was amazing and crazy rich. My friend had a chicken salad and she said it was amazing. I was happy with the prices. I didn't feel gouged or like we were just paying for being in a \"trendy spot.\" 
All in all, I would probably choose Timos over postinos primarily because of the comfortable seating (not jam packed in next to strangers) and the ease of parking. 
Glad we tried this based on it's yelp review!"}
{"text":"Sat outside tonight and had a great time and great food.   Would definitely recommend it to anyone.   Small parking lot so be good at reversing but everything else is perfect.   All day happy hour on Sunday!"}
{"text":"We decided to head North on Central for a change last night and stumbled upon Timo, and we're glad we did.

From the greeting we received when we entered all the way through desert we had a great experience.

We had the beet salad, squash soup, and corn chowder to start. All three were tasty.  The beer list was pretty extensive and had some unique choices(I know, wine bar, but we're not wine drinkers).  Some of our party had cocktails they liked as well. 

For our main course four of us split two pizzas. The short rib pizza had a good flavor and a spicy sauce to dip in. We also had the chicken jalepeno and enjoyed it as well.

We will definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Four of us came here during restaurant  week and loved the place. Very romantic. There is a fireplace in the back but rain prevented us from enjoying it. Food was excellent and they have a large list of wine.
A must try for a special occasion :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Excellent selections of wine (Chocolate Block! YUM!) and amazingly good flatbreads straight from a wood fired oven!"}
{"text":"Drinks are ok. Wines are better. Food is good. Atmosphere is awesome. Nice patio and a band playing."}
{"text":"Delicious cheese plates and nice selections of vinos. The outside patio is huge and tucked away where there is minimal traffic noise which helps with the mood!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in here on a whim. Everything was amazing! Food, ambiance, and service was awesome! Especially Amy, our bartender!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have a new favorite restaurant. Excellent food and service. We will be back."}
{"text":"Timo's Monday night special was a hit and I'm now almost positive I have found the perfect dinning companion. David and I are eating our way through the best of Phoenix and I'm secretly creating my own list along the way.   We decided on Monday night to take advantage of the flatbread and wine special. I had no Idea we would practically close out the place, two flatbreads, two bottles of wine and 6 tapas later. Wow, what a meal. David selected the wine, he's great at that and I selected the flatbreads and we both had dibs on a few tapas.  The lamb chops, tamarind drumettes, smoked salmon, warm figs & prosciutto and a salad. I specially liked the lamb chops and warm figs, David went crazy for the salad. 

We were both drunk ; )"}
{"text":"Timo's wine bar surpassed all expectations. Located right by my house I decided to check the restaurant out and boy was I glad I did. They offer a large assortment of wine with a unique and appetizing menu. I had their Mediterranean flat bread personal pizza which was absolutely amazing. The crust had just the right amount of crispness and the portion was filling. However I was more taken aback by the restaurant itself. We decided to sit outside on the patio which had a very trendy upscale feel. It had comfortable seating arrangements complete with string lights, a fire pit, and misters for those uncomfortable Arizona nights. I couldn't help but compare the restaurant to Postino's as it offers similar food and ambiance however Timo's definitely comes out on top. Postino's is often cramped with outrageous wait times and I have to say that the venue is a lot nicer here with better food. This place is an awesome restaurant to either bring a group of friends as they have good drink specials with large amounts of group seating or the perfect place to take a date as it's super classy with great food and lighting. Great job Timo's you've definitely impressed me and I will be sure to be back."}
{"text":"We took my wife out for Mother's Day here.  There were 6 diners at 2 tables beside us. I notice from other reviews that is not uncommon.  

We found the food to be delicious [roasted eggplant, oregano chicken, caprese sandwich, a glass of malbec]; the server was knowledgeable, courteous and professional.  She was also leaving in a week to work at Ajo Al's.

The place is designed well. Our small sampling of the fare indicates some of the food and wine issues addressed in previous reviews were fixed. Service and good employee retention issues may still need to be addressed.

I hope the place survives.  I look forward to being there many times in future."}
{"text":"I worked at Grimaldi's in Old Town throughout college and still rave about how great it is. That said, this place is damn delicious! Might I dare say... better? I will say it's different, so it's not a fair comparison but I was really impressed. The location is very cute with modern decor, lots of twinkle lights, comfy bar seats, roll-up garage doors, and an inviting patio. We ordered the antipasto, and the spicy salami and the mediterranean pizzas. The antipasto came with burrata and pesto, elephant garlic, lots of meats, and grilled artichoke. It was the perfect size for two people and the perfect start. The pizzas were not only thin but somehow also crispy and bready. The toppings didn't slide off from being too soggy and I actually ate the crusts. (I never eat the crusts.) The red sauce and spicy salami with caramelized onions made my night! We capped off a delicious meal with the banana and Nutella calzone, and were as equally impressed. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Wonderful evening on the gorgeous patio!  Service was friendly, attentive, and gave us recommendations as well as time to make our decisions.  Enjoyed Happy Hour food and drink menu followed by delicious pizza and chocolate creme brulee.
Great way to celebrate a birthday with family!
Will continue to recommend Timo as a neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the meal but it was a hefty cost that we paid for it. It's four stars for the food and two stars on drinks. Five stars on the setting and service. The meatballs were ok, the spicy sriracha shrimp was fajita like with more heat, but the pizza was fab. A glass of wine is pricey here and it doesn't go that long of a way either. Maybe the long drive had me parched but the glasses of wine seemed fairly smaller than the average pours. For a tapas place, wine is a must but it would be nice to have lower priced glasses available or perhaps more types to choose from in the glass option. Soda is served in a can, yes they give you the can. Indeed the patio was Amazing and the ambiance was perfect. A little crowded but manageable. I'd go again but would choose happy hour."}
{"text":"Overpriced, mediocre food. The saving grace is the location and ambience.  Nothing special about the food. The ingredients are not fresh and needs attention. This place has potential but this place could use more thought  surrounding  food quality and dining experience overall."}
{"text":"ate there again tonight, had the homemade bread, YUM!!!  We had some minor issues with our server, she totally screwed up our order but the General Manager made it right!  I would highly, highly recommend this restaurant for great bread, pizza and ambiance!!"}
{"text":"Love Timo!!! We like to come during brunch and happy hour to sit on the patio!! They have excellent food- we suggest the bruchetta or the antipasto platter!! The mimosa flight is also wonderful (only available during brunch on the weekends until 2:30). This place also has a great fireplace and lights on the patio for night time."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Timo for awhile and I don't know why it took me so long to go back. I went for brunch the other day with a couple friends and was reminded of how much I like the place. The food was outstanding and the atmosphere is very relaxing. I love that they don't have music blaring so loudly that you can't have a conversation. Great service too.  There are a lot of great places to dine in north and central Phoenix but we must not forget about our old favorites. I won't forget again!"}
{"text":"We ended up coming here on a whim after my fiancé received a gift card from a co-worker. Oh man,  we were NOT disappointed.  It was wonderful.  We got the Loaded Italian pizza (which has a great, seasoned crust) and a bruschetta board (rivals Postino's). Everything was wonderful and fresh.  The restaurant itself is beautiful.  The seats in the booth are low, be aware, lol.  Other than that,  I couldn't have been more satisfied.  The patio looked gorgeous, but it was raining when I went unfortunately.  $19 for a pizza and bottle of red or white wine on Mondays! Do it!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Great patio and the roll up garage doors make the inside feel al fresco (w/ a little air conditioning).  Great place to hang out and enjoy the weather.

Our server took our drink order...then our food order...then we waited. And waited. 25 minutes later, when we were about to leave, our server finally came by and informed us they had to squeeze more OJ for my wife's mimosa.  Another few minutes and my bottle of beer and wife's mimosa came, followed shortly by the food.  It was not busy or crowded so I guess we were overlooked?  

BUT the food was tasty. We had smoked salmon and crab cake eggs Benedict.  Both were really well composed and had great flavor...good enough to overlook the service and give Timo's another shot."}
{"text":"F'n awesome.  Got the artisan cheese board as an app - great.  Lasagna with house made sausage - best lasagna I have ever had, no kidding.  My wife got the Mediterranean white pizza - off the charts.  This place is the real deal, do not miss it.  We are visiting from out of town and stumbled on this gem.  FIVE STARS"}
{"text":"Closer to Meh than A Okay---We went for happy hour. The $5 glasses of wine are awesome, but the food specials are not that special. Cold bruschetta? Yuck. We ordered 2 glasses of wine and 3 appetizers. I have been here several times and received good service. Our service wasn't bad; the server was friendly. But she knew nothing about the menu or the food. She wasn't sure which wines they were out of (for a wine bar, the selection is pretty small). Also, we ordered the cheese plate and, in the past, we have been told which cheese is which, and so on. Our server dropped our food off without a word. A wine and cheese class might be helpful for the servers, who should be knowledgeable about the selection, both food and wine. Also, and this seems picky, the menu is difficult to read. The wines are grouped strangely, and within categories, there is no rhyme or reason to the listing. Artichoke dip and cheese plate were both yummy, by the way."}
{"text":"Had a friend take me here for a nice happy hour get together. We sat outside and while it was early and empty, still had a wonderful time enjoying our drinks and appetizers, at a budget conscience price but exceptional quality. I wouldn't hesitate to go again. I did see some problems with parking which might be an issue at a later hour, and our waitress had us pay before she clocked out and no one ever checked on us after that, but overall a great experience. We enjoyed the bruchetta done 3 ways, the artichoke dip and corn cakes and all were great, along with her wine and my lavender mint drink."}
{"text":"Awesome night on the patio. Our waitress recommended an amazing bottle of wine and the tapas were so good. The eggplant was phenomenal!  So pretty with the lights and fire pit. Music was low but good background and the patio was very relaxing."}
{"text":"Great quiet little wine bar.  Sat outside by the firepit and had good wine, tapas, and service.  Will be back"}
{"text":"Took my husband out here for dinner on his birthday. Called ahead and made a reservation for a table for two on the patio. Everything was ready when we got there.
Every table gets water in a nice glass bottle, which was a great touch. Our server was very nice to explain the menu. 
When we got there they still had happy hour. We ordered wine for $5 a glass, and some appetizers. The smoked salmon and the spicy salami bruscheta's were all very tasty and the perfect starters. We also got their starter apple wood fire wings, also very good. 
Then as our maim dish we ordered the short rib pizza to share. 
I was a little worried at first that it would be too heavy or too much, but it wasn't. It was perfect and she also brought out fresh parmesan cheese, which I love. 
When she asked if we wanted to order desert, I mentioned that it was my husband's bday, and so she gave us the resert menu and said we had to pick one and it would be on the house. How nice is that?
And so we got to try the peach cobbler. It was the perfect combination of sweet and sour peachy flavors. There is no other way I can describe it.
Needless to say we had a great time there. Loved the patio with all the lights and the fire pit when it got dark. Very romantic but chil vibe. Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. Like really delicious.

The bruschetta was crunchy but overly so, and the toppings were perfect. The margarita pizza was thin and crispy and the lamb chops were toasted perfectly. Even the escargot was great - and I've never had it before!

The only part of the food I didn't like was the salmon cakes, but their peach cobbler made up for it. 

The atmosphere is laid back, the staff was nice, and for the price, you get what you pay for. 

I recommend it and will definitely return if I'm on that side of town again."}
{"text":"Well...after years of being in love with Timo Wine Bar, and their Crispy Kale Ceasar Salad...that would be about the only reason to go back.  The bruschetta, which WAS the best in the city, has sadly gone the way of many overpriced restaurants...all bread, no toppings.  The spicy copa used to be amazing...now just one layer and minimal burrata cheese underneath.  The apple bruschetta actually came with the core of the apple in the slice - really?  And the salmon bruschetta was dry and so unappealing on top of the huge slice of bread.

The fig appetizer took 30 minutes to get to us and was cold, and lukewarm, and a mess on the plate.

It was like pulling teeth to get our waitress to pay attention to us because there was a party of about 7 people on the patio....really?  That bogs you down?  But that was her excuse...for the other 3 parties of 2 people each that needed service.  

I hope Timos management reads these because I would hate for them to go the way of Corbins down the street."}
{"text":"We love this place! The atmosphere, the service and the food are all top notch. 

The first time we came to Timo's it was my birthday. I did some hunting on Yelp as we really enjoy tapas I was looking to a place to get them. The menu has some delightful tapas or appetizers as they the portions for them are are on the big side. I have had the escargot on several occasions and the first time was simply amazingly good. This dish does seem to very depending on the cook that is working but it has never been bad. The artichoke dip is another that's always outstanding.

There bruschetta is quite nice it has a bit of a twist to it as you can select from a variety of toppings from traditional to neuvo. The wood fired pizza is terrific! The sandwiches to die for yummy... And have I mentioned the wine... It is a solid list of good wines at really reasonable values. They are hand picked and change regularly, most can be by the glass or the bottle. There are three specials two of which are in the menu. The third you need to know about as it is a hidden one for regular customers. Look for the Sunday and Monday specials on the menu, they both will make for a great meal for two including the wine... for the price most of us would gladly pay for the bottle alone. *** Tip The third requires you to be on the email list and is sent out on a regular basis. Check out the web site for details ***

I may add more later to this review, just know you will find this Jem of the Desert a true oasis from the mondane."}
{"text":"Love the quaint patio, mood is calm, food is very good."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere! Wonderful artichoke dip. Nice wine selection. That's it. Leave after that. 

Service was poor. The lasagna was reheated and served cold. The pizza was missing half the ingredients. My ice tea was left empty. We we never offered another glass of wine.

This could be a great spot! Just need some folks that know how to run a lil restaurant on a Friday night.

We won't bother giving it another try. To many great places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Finally got here for Brunch, which negates none of my previous review, in fact it solidifies it!

This brunch is phenomenal! From the Mimosa Flight to the Egg-White Frittata to the gigantic sausage patty on the sausage and egg sandwich...just excellently done!

Dogs are allowed, so bring your pup. Expect to see dusty people having hiked North Mountain as well as hungover hipsters et al. 

Timo is so good that we left athletic gear there and they got in touch and got it back to us! This place is awesome!!!!! Go!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Reasonable prices. The back patio is big and very cozy. Beautiful ambiance."}
{"text":"The husband and I drive by this place frequently and always say we should try it out. Well, we finally did on New Year's Day. We came for lunch and the place was deserted except for one lunch couple on the patio. We stepped inside and the waiter told us we could sit wherever. The husband informed him we will be sitting on the patio and back outside we went. The patio is nice. It's open and airy, while still enclosed by trees and a deconstructed-looking fence. Music is playing via tiny Bose speakers, there's a fire pit (which looks inviting, but wasn't lit), and a tiny water fall (where cute sparrows bathed). The patio was very nice during the day but I bet it looks even more inviting at night. 

Our waiter came out and asked if we were ready to order and I asked what type of bread the sandwiches are on and how they are cooked (they are called \"Wood Fired Sandwiches\"). He looked at me like I was ridiculous and I guess I felt a little silly, but I wanted to know if it was regular sandwich bread, pita bread, a bun, etc. He told me its bread and it's thrown in the fire, not literally, but like near the fire. I was confused but the prosciutto, copa, triple cream brie, tomato, and olive tapenade sandwich sounded really good... so I ordered that. The husband ordered the braised short rib calzone. Our meals came on a cute wooden cutting board with a side of crispy kettle chips. My sandwich came on a bun, which was delicious. Overall, I really liked my sandwich. It was a little on the salty side, but everything on the sandwich by itself is normally salty and delicious. The husband was a little jealous and stole about half of my sandwich. (Which is fine, because I stole his chips.) The calzone was good but it definitely wasn't a traditional calzone. It was wrapped in a flatbread, shaped to look like a calzone but definitely not fully enclosed like the calzones we are used to. I liked the flavors, but wasn't too impressed with the bread. (Both of us expected closed, doughy goodness.) 

Overall, it was a good experience and we really enjoyed our sandwiches. We're looking forward to coming back for dinner!"}
{"text":"This place is beyond awesome! The ambiance, the food, the wine, the setting -- just amazing, and so much fun to sit outside on the patio around the blazing fire pit drinking a glass of their boutique wine, and eating their creative bruschetta tapas. But all their menu items are great!

This is one of our favorite places that we frequent as often as possible. Truly a delightful venue that you'll want to visit time and again. :-)"}
{"text":"Recommended from our hotel concierge, Timo's was a surprise find. And what a nice surprise it was! Ambiance was very relaxed with some nice finer touches. We sat out by the massive fire pit on a chilly night. The food was killer. Everything we had was fresh baked, hot and flavorful. They even custom ordered my pizza to accommodate a white pizza with bacon and 3 eggs on top. They nailed it."}
{"text":"Cute place, foods good and nice environment.  Nothing real jumps out about the place but I've been there several times and always had a good experience."}
{"text":"My dad suggested this place for brunch yesterday (again, my dad catching onto awesome local places before I do...oh well). I just wanted a Bloody Mary, so I wasn't really sure what to expect as far as their brunch menu. We sat down under a huge tree on the patio and my dad mentioned that service is usually kind of slow, but the food is worth it. I don't know if they were just faster than usual this day or if my dad and I's definitions of \"slow\" differ, but our server was attentive and our drinks and food came out pretty quickly. My parents & I ordered our Bloodys - spicy for my dad and regular for my mother and I. They were delicious - I am pretty picky when it comes to Bloodys and they didn't disappoint. I was impressed with the food - I ordered the crab cake eggs Benny, and the fingerling potatoes, asparagus, and sauce were all just as delicious as the main dish. My boyfriend ordered some kind of breakfast flatbread, which looked more like a pizza when it came out and was much bigger than we expected (you could easily split it between two people). I tried some of the crust and it was awesome. We will definitely be back, especially considering that the patio is dog-friendly. The only weird thing about our brunch was the water (go figure). Every once in a while in Phoenix, you go somewhere and every time you take a sip of water, there is some horrible smell - I can't figure out if it's the Phoenix water or the way the restaurants wash their dishes or what. I just ended up ditching the water and sticking to my booze, so it worked out okay. ;)"}
{"text":"What a joke,  party of 12 and our food came out separate in a 30 minute span. Food definitely sub par, I'm a restaurant manager and was very disappointed. Better places than this. Not coming back"}
{"text":"This place is a new gem in the crown of the revitalized Sunnyslope.  Unfortunately I missed this place when it was Bomberos but I'm happy I found it in its current iteration as it's pretty great.

Decor wise this place is super rad, completely redone and they open up the restaurant when it's nice outside (most of the year).  There's a huge patio out back as well!

The service was fantastic and the wine selection is great!

Ok, the special.  I hope that this place doesn't get as hard to get into on Mondays as Postino is on the nights they run their specials.  Flatbread pizza and a great bottle of wine for less than the bottles cost on their own.

You've got to try this place out if you haven't been here yet!!!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here the other day with my husband and father-in-law, everything was delicious! If you go, you must have the beet salad - I've been craving it since!"}
{"text":"Maybe even 5 stars.  My lady and I met here on a our first date.  The inside is set up nice with good ambiance.  The outside seating area is crazy good.  Lots of comfortable seats and is huge and has interesting decor.

Wine is wine and as good as it comes.  Food was Artichoke dip first time and second time was a Proschiutto, Fig and blue cheese appetizer.  Yeah...way good!"}
{"text":"The place itself is really nice, quaint. The service and food was really good. My only complaint, $28 for a SMALL pitcher of sangria - lil steep."}
{"text":"What a charming place and patio and dog friendly!! Timo Tuesdays is the draw with great deals for wine coupled with items off the menu!  One of my favorite dishes was the Escargot however something has changed!!! What was an amazing dish has turned into dry flavorless snails in a dish!  Dont mess with the magic of signature dishes....needless to say a great evening!"}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem.  Love everything here they make killer cocktails and pretty much anything else.  The patio is great and love the ambience.  I was a tad disappointed with the pizza I ordered, but lamb chops were good as well as the bruschetta but my favorite thing on the menu is the peach cobbler.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Meh...

It was... okay.  We first walked in and nobody was there to seat us.  So we kind of wandered in more so that someone felt compelled to seat us. Unfortunately our waitress lacked any semblance of a personality.  We're personable but quiet and wanted a rapport with her, she apparently would not have any of it.

The beer selection is pretty decent for the restaurant. I thought they'd just have a couple of bottles and a few taps.  The food was unfortunately forgettable. I'm actually looking at the online menu right now trying to remember what we got.  

NOW I REMEMBER!!!  So let me start by saying we are faithful followers of Postino's and were hoping for a similar but different (we were tired of Postino's) dining experience.  Looking at the menu I was pleasantly surprised and was excited. Okay so we got a couple of bruschettas and a flatbread. I feel like we got the pancetta flatbread and then the copa, the salmon and the apple bruschetta's.  The flatbread was great but the menu is designed with delicate flavors,  the whole point being that you taste each ingredient individually and then as a whole.  Unfortunately the cook has such a heavy hand with the truffle oil that it almost gave the flatbread a \"plant-processed\" taste.  You need to be delicate with truffle oil or else it goes bad quick, and it tasted funky. 

WIth the bruschetta's, same thing.  They are designed around delicate flavors but they either had truffle oil on them or had a HORRENDOUS lemon peel on top of them that was ABSOLUTELY off putting.  It seems as though they pickle the lemon peel and then place it on these bruschetta's for more flavor??? Change the recipe if it's not enough flavor for you, but the flavor is meant to be delicate.  Do not place a lemon wedge on it to distract from the lovely ingredients you have in front of me. I would say scrap that lemon business, it would do better as a garnish on a salad. Or for a sweetened version of the lemon, put it on a dessert.  Please stop destroying your food. 

Great place to try, but I will not be returning. 

OH!!! P.S.  The decor is LOVELY... seriously..."}
{"text":"Love me my Timo time....great happy hour and lovely brunch, our server Nathan is fantastic, and the vocalist, David Sheehy is to die for....best party in town when he plays the patio...good timed."}
{"text":"Great place. Great food. Laid back sort of place. Not loud. I like that. Great setting as well. Nice outside patio area."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places in the neighborhood. They have great food and a very cozy patio"}
{"text":"This is a must if in Central Phoenix. It is an unassuming industrial set up that sits next to an auto parts store, but it works! We passed it the first time and had to u-turn it. Once we found the entrance, we were greeted pleasantly by Nick and he took us the rest of the way. TIMO is a wine (and full) bar with insane food. We started with a Pino Grigio (wife) and I sampled a Pinot Noir. Our first pairing was a Brushetta sampling that was off the charts! You can select three (of many) for a  reasonable price, but we had our eye on four - mushroom and brie; a ricotto w/ lemon zest; a salmon w/ balsamic reduction; and a traditional. Amazing! I ponied up to a full body Cab, and enjoyed the diver scallops and a margerhita pizza (way too much food). Scallops were insane. The crust on the pizza was like none I have ever tasted. We finished with the peach cobbler with homemade whip and vanilla bean ice cream. All for about $100 - very reasonable!

I cannot say enough about Nick and the others. Everyone seemed to care. We are out of towners and will make this stop a must everytime! Thanks for a killer evening. The only suggestion is sometimes I am not a wine-mood guy and would prefer a tap IPA. I will sacrifice and drink from a can just to enjoy the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Timo Wine Bar is just what the three stars represent 'A-OK' the food is okay nothing memorable and I consider myself a foody. Although, the area is small it's trendy especially the outside patio that welcomes pets and the wine selection varies. I love how they chill the red but attitude is everything. Call me old school but customer service is important especially this day and age. The servers aren't quant as the restaurant represents since the location is meshed in with the neighborhood I expected a neighborly attitude, doesn't matter how good the food, great the wine and how perfect the ambience can be if customer service is not on point....Next restaurant please."}
{"text":"I cannot believe that in 3 years of living in Phoenix within 5 miles of this place I had never heard of it!!  Shame on me!  Was out for a Friday afternoon bike ride along the canal and had a tip from a friend about this place. On a whim at the end of our ride decided to check it out. At first glance just ok. So so bike rack and limited parking in a not great area. Oh boy do they make up for that!! Sat at the bar after locking up the bikes. Had an amazing view of the wood oven and the super cool guy that cooks in that oven \"Chewy\". Watched everything on the menu come out of the oven. A great way to check out the place. Bar tenders were great, managers great. Big crowd on an early Friday night. \"Chewy\" gave us a taste of an amazing ceviche of scallops and we were sold then on the wood fired diver scallops. These are cooked at super high temps in the oven and the served with a pesto sauce and garnished with micro greens and topped off with Parmesan!  Awesome is an understatement!  We were just in for drinks and an app as were in bike clothes and had to get home. Cannot wait to return for dinner. Things we saw being cooked that looked exciting  were: wood fired Ahi, spinach dip, bruschetta w portobello and Brie w balsamic, the wood fired wings looked amazing. We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Really nice shaded patio area with music. The calzone was tasty and more sandwich like than a typical big doughy football type calzone. My wife got the bruschetta (did I spell that right?), and it was also delicious."}
{"text":"This place is great! I like the vibe and the service. 

Meatballs-great
Sarachi shrimp-tasty 
House made bread w/ hot and honey butter- yummy
Pizza-pretty good (I'm from Chicago and hard to impress when it comes to pizza)

The wine menu is pretty decent. 

Overall, everything was tasty and well done! If I am in the area, I would be compelled to stop by again."}
{"text":"Love the outdoor patio and atmosphere.. 5 stars there. Perfect for date night. Wine pours were pretty small. Would be better at happy hour. Ordered the salmon corn cakes- small in size- too much of a fishy taste, but would order for small,healthy app. Looks like Sunday and Monday nights are the nights to come for awesome specials- and heard the pizzas are great.. Would likely rank higher!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after the Sunnyslope art fair. The outdoor patio was beautiful. Had an cocktail and enjoyed the ambiance.  The service was spot on."}
{"text":"Timo Wine Bar is one of my new favorite hot spots! I love all of the gluten free options, quaint ambiance, love live music and most importantly the memorable experience Nathan provides on a consistent basis."}
{"text":"We went to Timo Wine Bar to try it out for my birthday dinner before a show last Saturday night. We arrived around 5pm and were seated on the patio immediately. The patio is super cute and has great ambiance. We felt very comfortable right away and it only got better from there. I was pleased to find out it was still happy hour until 6pm and ordered glass of wine. We started with the anti-pasta platter based on our server's recommendation. It was delicious! We asked for a bit more bread because we gobbled up the few pieces it came with very quickly. Our server brought more right away and we (mostly me) ate every yummy bit on the platter. We ordered the wood fired chicken and the loaded Italian pizza for entrees. Both were delicious also, but most of the pizza came home with us - too full. Overall our service was fantastic, the food was great, and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Timo has a great environment. The outdoor seating is nice. The food is just average though. This is not somewhere I would go out of my way for but it's worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Timo's was selected as this month's foodie adventure for our work party of 9 was which excellent with the help of our awesome server, Kevin who even helped us celebrate a couple of birthdays. We enjoyed Kevin's many recommendations for both good and wine!

Making a decision for Top Picks was tough as everything was deliciously prepared. We enjoyed all 3 thin crust pizzas but picked the (def not ordinary) Mediterranean for originality and the Chicken Jalapeño for creativity. 

The Spicy Copa stood out as the best amongst the other selection of delicious bruschetta. 

For Tapas, the crab cakes. 

Best for sharing was the Artichoke & Spinach dip, another def not ordinary

And for Oven Pizzas, the short ribs. 

To be honest, it was tough making choices because there wasn't a bad dish on the menu; which we probably covered about 90%. We will definitely keep this one at the top of the list! Thank you Kevin and Timo for the great foodie adventure, experience and a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"Visited Timo with several friends on a Friday night. We were seated on the outside patio, which has fabulous ambiance. Our table was under big trees and had lovely heating lamps to keep us warm. I would highly recommend sitting outside if you go.

We ordered a round of drinks, some of their famous bread for an appetizer, and then got various entrees for dinner. Our drinks took quite a while to arrive, despite that we simply ordered two glasses of wine and a Moscow Mule. We chucked it up to the place being busy, and moved on. 

The bread was excellent, warm and served with two options for dipping, a sweet butter or pesto sauce. I enjoyed both. For my meal, I chose the Prosciutto Thin Crust pizza. It was good, but my other friends ordered the Italian Meats Pizza, which was much heartier and more flavorful. I had wished I had gotten that. My third friend ordered a Prosciutto sandwich, which she described as just being \"okay\". She said she had expected it to be served warm, and it was cold. 

We were about 1/2 way through our dinner when I ordered a second glass of wine. It did not arrive until we were all finished eating, and then, our waitress poured it into my friend's empty wine glass by mistake. When we told her it was supposed to be for me, she asked if I would mind just drinking out of my friend's glass instead, rather than offering  to get another pour. I wouldn't have minded too terribly, except that I had really wanted to enjoy the glass with the rest of my meal, and it was already too late. :-/"}
{"text":"Bravo Timo! Well done. 

I loved Bomberos and Timo has moved in to the beautiful spot and went easy on the remodeling.. If it ain't broke don't fix it! The patio was left intact and is gorgeous. I would recommend this for groups or for a romantic dinner for two. When it is cold the fire pit is awesome and it is quaint and charming. 

The inside is cozy and well designed, I usually opt to sit at the bar so I can watch them prepare my food and slide it in to the wood fired oven.  I went for brunch last week and it was awesome (see pics).

I had the benedict with avocado, tomato, black truffle, prosciutto and hollandaise  and it was simply divine!  I could not leave without trying the grapefruit brulee, equally scrumptious.

I can't wait to go back for dinner. They have a bottle of wine and a flatbread for $20 on Mondays!"}
{"text":"I had hoped to be able to enjoy this place, as it it so close to my home. Unfortunately I walked out before I was able to try anything. I was greeted at the menu stand on the patio and told I could sit anywhere unless it had a reserved sign on it. That was the last time any staff member acknowledged my presence. I chose a table close to the entrance and watched as 3 other couples sat and were taken care of while my party remained invisible. After the server finally made eye contact I thought \"phew, he just realized we were sitting here and he'll be right over\"... Not the case. After 12 minutes we finally decided to just go somewhere else and as we were leaving the server was standing by the entrance and still didn't say a word to us. Drat, I really wanted to find a new go to place."}
{"text":"Awesome though a little pricey (Cabernet for $16 a glass?). Wonderful patio with firepit and comfy seating around it. Great atmosphere. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I want to say that I was not expecting to find such a good restaurant in Arizona.
I was here for a convention with the American Cancer Society. I was with friends and we decided that we needed to go out to a nice girl night dinner the first night that we arrived. I never though that I would find this gem.

I would've given it a five star but the service was not the best. 

Food: was amazing! Such a good menu. They had so much good food. I went with a bunch of girls and we had share all our food. It was my first time having escargot and it was surprising good. There is a brie soup with truffle oil and I highly recommend that you try this. The spinach dip was amazing and I love the toast they serve with it. Also, if you like scallops, you must try this places scallops because they were cooked perfectly. 
They have a cool brochette plate where you can pick three of there brochette and the brochette is huge. I highly recommend doing the brochettes because they are big and totally worth the price (about $13). It is also very filling. However, my friend was little disappointed with the salmon because it wasn't warm (i think or there was too much). 

The atmosphere: Its very romantic and they have an outside patio area with lights and it so pretty. Also, there chairs are like little couches or comfy chairs. I sat with my friend on this little leather couch. Its a very intimate setting. Def a good place to bring a date or have a girls night. 
 
Lastly, I will say I really enjoyed the sangrias because they were so tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"Expensive, average food, gluten free bread options are misleading. They just skip the bread with bruschetta & simply call it gluten free. Should have listened to my gut instinct. I don't understand the hype, maybe it's for the wine which was decent but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Quick stop after work for a drink and appetizers. Just missed happy hour. If you can get there before 6pm they have some great deals. 
Very nice atmosphere, cute and trendy. They had the white chocolate beer that my husband and I love. The service was quick and the food was yummy! We shared the spinach and artichoke app along with the spicy salami pizza. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"I eat eggs but I'm not a fan of them.  Today I had the best eggs ever on the Brunch Flat Bread at Timo's.  Now I understand why people eat eggs.  The crust was remarkable.  The burrata cheese was a new taste surprise.  Fruit bowl was mostly cantaloupe but that was OK because the quality of the fruit was great.  Service was on point.  Loved the inside vibe.  Can't wait until it cools down to check out the outside vibe.  Only helpful hint...Mimosa was too tart.  Would have preferred more orange juice.  I was there with a brunch group and everyone else had great food too."}
{"text":"Quite the corner bistro.  Fresh ingredients always make for a good food, which Timo offers.  Had the flatbread pizzas from the wood fire oven.  Enjoyed the margherita and the home-made sausage varieties.  Dark and romantic atmosphere, good place to take a date as there is ambient music without being in-your-face about it.  Servers are very friendly and are eager to make suggestions for both food and wine."}
{"text":"We discovered that place by total accident because I would most likely never go to a restaurant in sunny slope unless it really was amazing. We drove past it on our way to our actual destination but the wait was too long so we drove back to timo.

As a starter, We got their wings and they were really good. They were really fancy shmancy, which I don't prefer. I like going caveman on my sloppy wings. Then for our meals we got the margherita pizza and Mediterranean thin crust pizza half with chicken on it. We always determine if a place is good by their cheese or margherita pizza. This place had a delicious margherita pizza! They had lots of fresh basil on it. The Mediterranean pizza was good. It was super crispy and flavorful. I don't like chicken so I didn't try the other half but my bf liked it. And it was a major plus because most of the food is wood fired! 

Service was good and ambiance was reaaallyy nice. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ok, so a little bit of a mixed bag, but leaning much more towards the positive. Very convenient parking and a garden area out back. Very clean, nice decor, great ambience, tastefully decorated. Reminded me of similar places in London. However the bench seats are too low and soft, my companion almost vanished into one. I had a glass of Reisling, and to be honest if I didn't know it I would have said it was a Chardonnay. It lacked the crispness and 'bite' of a good Reisling, but not unpleasant to drink. My companion's mimosa was excellent! The food was really good too, and nicely presented and the service was great. Overall a very pleasing experience and I certainly intend to go back."}
{"text":"We had a great time the other night for Ladies Night Out With Wine! I'm sure most of the greatness was the company we shared, but the location totally helped. 

We got a great little comfortable table inside the newly remodeled building, side note: it used to be Bomberos. It looks so much more open and inviting than the old place was. They have the doors all open and great decor. 

We ordered a couple bottles of wine, had some tapas, flat breads, soup and salads. Their menu looks very inventive and interesting. I had a bite of the rib flat bread, and it was amazing, I would love to go back and try it again. The girl shared the brie soup, and I am pretty sure they loved every bite, since when the waiter tried to clear it from the table he almost got a fork in his hand. My Cesar salad was OK, the chicken with it was really good. 

It is close to my house, so I am very excited to put it Ont he wine bar rotation!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am sure a future review with a 5th star is pending - because this place is fantastic.  

The food is great.  I have had an appetizer, the Timo Trio for lunch, and I have had a flatbread pizza.  Nothing disappointed.  Their waitstaff is attentive, they give you more of whatever you need - and don't hassle you about it.  I love the new decor (yes, I said new decor - I frequented this place when it was... what it used to be.)  It has a very urban-classy vibe.  

Four stars because...

We went on a pretty slow lunch Friday a couple of weeks ago and it took us about 40 minutes to get our food.  My panini with my Timo Trio was not great (sorry, it wasn't) but the rocket greens and the soup MORE than made up for that.  I had the tomato soup and I am looking forward to trying the Brie.  However, given that we were on a workday lunch, we would have appreciated faster service.

The mojito lemonade!  It's fantastic!  So fantastic I would pay for two!  I get that it's probably not free refills because I am sure they are not the easiest or most fun thing to make, but i would be more than happy to pay for a second.  Please ask me next time.  Each time I have ordered it I have never been asked if I'd like a) a lemonade (plain) refill or b) another mojito lemonade.  It's your tab and your tip and all, but I think I'd go for it if it were me.  :)

Also, I am not sure that this is the case yet, but there does not appear to be a place for any live music.  Even a singer/songwriter guitar player would be awesome.  It doesn't have to be as elaborate as \"it used to be\" - but that was one of the incredible things about this place/location.  Just something to think about.

So, like I said, I am sure we will be back and back and back and a 5-star review is well in the works.  Can't wait to see how this place grows and changes and works out any quirks."}
{"text":"Now that I have the opportunity to write a review, I will be able to remove the bitchy quick tip.....
I used to live over by this restaurant.  I have only been here for dinner.  I must admit that the food is awesome.....now for the reason they lost stars.

I made plans to meet friends at the new farmer's market on Central and Northern.  They asked if there were any cool places to eat for breakfast and I immediately thought of this place.  I checked on-line to see if they still had brunch.  The hours posted on the site said they opened at 8.  So I planned the day's events around meeting at Timo's at 9 am for breakfast.  

I showed up early so that I could coordinate and they were closed.  There were no cars in the parking lot.  I immediately called the number and it was just a message saying \"you have reached voice mailbox number blah blah blah, please leave a message.\"  I immediately looked for the closest restaurant for breakfast near me so I could divert my friends.  

I also added the quick tip stating: Don't bother going here for bfast - they are closed with no explanation on their voice mail.  As I was driving away to go to another breakfast joint, I saw a sign that said remodeling - in all fairness, it may have been the adjacent building.  Anyway, I ended up getting an email from someone saying that there is a sign somewhere (on a fence????) saying they open at 9:30.  I have since removed the quick tip.

Long story short....GOD DAMN IT!!!!!  Web content changes take a matter of SECONDS!!!!  If you change your hours then change your fucking web site.  I have no tolerance for shoddy business practices.  They lost 2 stars because of the horrible experience.  

CHANGE YOUR EFFING POSTED HOURS ON YOUR SITE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really cool spot, patio is awesome and the dining room has two huge openings to the outside. Great happy hour deals to go along with great food and drinks. The short rib pizza ties together sweet potatoes, banana peppers and a nice amount of cheese for a great range of flavor. I'm also usually disappointed with antipasto plates but theirs is terrific. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch last week and was very pleased.  We had an order of  bruschetta and a proscuitto sandwich which was easily enough for 3 people. Service was excellent.  Menu has some similarities to Bombero's but there are clearly differences.  The wood oven adds a real punch to the food."}
{"text":"Went here for a Birthday Party, great atmosphere, and setting for dinner.

Date night specials on Sunday and Monday for dinner do are a steal that include a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Timo Wine Bar! Second time here and second time by myself, although I do not live in the area (commute for work) I will definitely bring my husband and stop by with co-workers. I absolutely love the environment, kind of reminds me of a place you would duck into in the city (San Francisco), and sit back, relax and enjoy the atmosphere completely loosing track of time. Observing the interactions between the cooks, waitresses and what appeared to be the manager on my first visit it is obvious that they work in unison. Had the same bartender, Amy has been amazing, answered all of my questions and treated all guests equally whether they ordered one beer and left, or in my case 3 Sangrias and an appetizer, and is also willing to hold a conversation (big plus in my book)!

Now the food and drinks.....drumroll please.....I've tried two different dishes on their happy hour menu and was not disappointed!!!!! And the Sangria? It's  made in house and are generous with the portions. This is now my go to spot after work, either alone or with someone else! 

I could go on and on but why don't you come and experience yourself!"}
{"text":"I have gone 3 times each time the person or persons that I went with ended up referring their friends and going again.  It is small .. or should I say intimate inside.  The patio is beautiful.  Love the Escargot Barcelona from the Tapas menu has the perfect accent of spinach and sundried tomatoes. The sausage kale soup, andouille sausage, garbanzo bean tastes fabulous and is filling enough for a meal for me/  Great drink specials and weekday Happy Hour food specials   Love it will go back again"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good I had the short ribs and hubby had lamb.  Both were cooked like it was a pot roast.  Mine was a bit salty..  Wanted to pour a little water on the food.   We did have a bread appetizer with pesto and some sort of butter honey.   Butter honey  was delicious,  pesto was drowning in olive oil so didn't have much flavor.   The ambiance of the restaurant was cozy and relax.   Waitress was friendly but didn't seem to want to take the time to explain anything.   For the price of the two entrées and one appetizer $54 was a bit expensive.  This was not really worth it to me.   I've had better food in an upscale environment so we won't be coming back.   But im glad I did try it."}
{"text":"Omg best brunch I have had in a long time.  Great bloody Mary's, relaxing patio, and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Yummy tapas. Delicious pizzas. Everything was fresh and unique. If my 12 year old liked it."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. Had the egg white frittata and the hibiscus iced tea. Enjoyed the cookies too!"}
{"text":"This was a cute little wine bar that I'm very glad I found thanks to Yelp! It was a Thursday night and there was a decent amount of people outside in the patio area. I was glad that I had made a reservation in advance because it was awesome going right to our table for 10 girls without a wait of any hassle! the staff was extremely helpful (and we all agreed they were super cute). The weather was nice outside and although it got colder as the night crept in, they had a huge fire pit and gas powered heaters scattered throughout. The live music was wonderful and the musician was funny and took requests. He even allowed our friend Ricki to perform her original song! It was awesome! We ate a bunch of appetizers like salmon bruschetta, chicken wings, escargot, and spinach dip I think it was. The flatbreads were great too! They have a great selection of wine, we stayed for hours getting tipsy in a classy manner, it was after all my sister's last night as a single lady!"}
{"text":"Love Timo's! Great food, great wine and a great atmosphere! I have been there several times and I always have a great meal and a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"Wood-fired brick oven recipes with much of the preparation done in front of you. The restaurant is very romantic. Tho I sit at the bar, I see a beautiful xeriscape courtyard, urban oasis out back. Diners looking for a unique culinary experience will find it.

Salmon Tapas.  I'm a real fan of salmon. It's a flavorful fish. When my two tapas are served they look delicious. I also enjoyed a brew from their beer garden. A winter ale, and it paired perfectly with my meal. 

This house is a place where the wood-fired oven community can enjoy wonderful recipes. Brimming with creative, tasty dishes and wood-fired cooking know-how. I have come to the conclusion that my kitchen at home deserves a wood oven."}
{"text":"EAT HERE! This place exceeded my expectations. First, I never stepped foot inside Timo's but I feel that I didn't need to. The outside is absolutely beautiful. The ambiance was intimate and relaxing. Comfortable chairs covered the patio with settings big enough for large groups or small tables of two for a more intimate evening. The large fire pit in the middle was where my group decided to sit. Even on a chilly night, the blazing fire keeps you warm and cozy, not to mention the standalone heaters scattered around the patio. Beautiful Einstein lights hang about the trees overhead with soothing music making for the perfect dinner. 

Enough about the look, let's talk food. First, take my word for it and order the bruschetta board appetizer. You pick three different topping styles and, though I'm sure they're all delicious, you HAVE to try the goat cheese one. If I had to complain, I'd say there should be more goat cheese on it! Beautifully displayed, the three we ordered (roasted tomato, goat cheese, & cubano) all tasted sensational  and it's priced very appropriately for the amount and taste quality of the food. 

My group all ordered salads and had no complaints. We tried the Brussels sprout, salmon, and roasted butternut squash salads and licked he bowls clean! All healthy options that you can tailor pretty easily to your preference. I'd definitely recommend eating here and next time I'm in Phoenix, I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"I came here on a hot Phoenix afternoon and sat outside. The outside was decent. Nice chill decor and large trees for shade. (except the tree kept on dropping things on the table). I tried the Bruschetta (the spicy copa..., apples..., and roasted eggplant...). The roasted eggplant didn't have a lot of flavor. The apples were hard to eat because they were just cut up long ways and stacked on the bread and kept on falling of when I bit into it. The fig jam was good though. The most flavorful was the spicy copa, but it was kind of gross seeing oil drip down when I saw my boyfriend eating it. The bread itself wasn't that good though, either. Also tried the TImo Benedict, and that was pretty tasty. The egg was nicely cooked, but I got grossed out after crunching on some egg shell (I was able to spit some of the egg shell out.) The asparagus was also really oily. Overall, the flavors were good and there was a good attempt at making its dishes better than average."}
{"text":"Bopped in here for the the 'Monday Night Special': flatbread and a bottle of wine for $19! Yay deal!

We enjoyed the pancetta and asparagus flatbread, with caramelized onions added. Scrumptious! We also ordered the tamarind drumettes with sweet chili sauce. The place was hopping and our seats at the bar provided a cozy perch to people watch and enjoy our munchies. 

You know when you first meet someone and it may be too early to tell, but you think it could really be something special? That's how I'm feeling about Timo. I hope it's love."}
{"text":"Used to adore this place, everything was first rate, food, menu selections, beautiful patio and interior. Was there recently, and served my favorite crab cake and egg dish with something that was supposed to be hollandaise. Tasted like someone opened a pouch and hastily mixed warm water with a Hollandaise mix, ( not even a decent mix). So sad."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant and wine bar, a very unexpected surprise when I went to dinner here after visiting grandma in the hospital down the street.  The food is good and the service is excellent.  It's not at all what I expected to find on Central and Dunlap.  Hopefully I won't be visiting JCL hospital anytime soon, but if I am in the area I'll probably stop by Timo to get something to eat."}
{"text":"No one wears gloves at all when preparing any food, they touch everything.  Will not
go there again, and, it is too small and too noisy"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I went on a weekend just to grab a glass of wine with a  friend. Well several glasses later, we were still there. The outside patio is a great spot, if you are lucky enough to get near the fire pit. But if not, there are heat lamps on the outside tables to keep the warmth. The staff was friendly and helpful. And attention gentlemen! Incase you are looking for a great date night, this would be the place to go. Hint hint! Although I can see this place getting very crowded, so I'd make reservations."}
{"text":"The bruschetta is a very good size. You get 3 choices and all are fabulous. We also tried the antipasto, it was a nice plate but I didn't care for the cured meat selection. Our waiter was courteous and informative. Great outdoor seating with umbrellas for daytime and candles for evening ambiance."}
{"text":"After seeing pictures online I SO wanted to love this place! However, it just missed the ball with me.

The overall feel and vibe is there, but the outside dining area definitely needs some TLC! It looks almost \"abandoned\". There were leaves everywhereee, spiderwebs on the fence that lines the dining area, random decor pieces, including CDs and bottles hanging from the trees, a rat bait station in plain view... I mean really, c'mon! I told my friend (who was dining with me) that it looks like it was once a great place that the owner gave up on. 

I get that you're going to face the elements when dining outside, but you still want it to \"feel\" clean. When you walk in, the far left corner of the patio (where the bait station is) is so empty and not very nice to look at. They could add some cacti or flowers or something to add appeal.

Their saving grace for me was the food. It was delish! We had the spinach and artichoke dip, ceviche (steep price!), and buffalo wings. It was all good!

I didn't get a chance to look at the interior dining room, but my friend said it was pretty. The bathrooms were nice & clean. Parking lot was teeny tiny! 

Overall we had an enjoyable experience, but it was lacking. I am tempted to go back at night to check out the ambiance and live music."}
{"text":"What a wonderful way to spend the evening! Sipping wine under the patio lights, dining on bruschetta and antipasto, it was the perfect end to a busy day. Michelle could not have been more attentive & helpful. We may have to return tomorrow night - there were so many menu options that we could easily have been there for hours drinking wine & nibbling on the small plates."}
{"text":"We go to Timo all the time and LOVE the food. Everything at Timo is fresh and delicious. If you are looking for a restaurant to have happy hour with friends, this place is a great pick. The decor is great and the outside patio is cozy. The peach sangria is to die for. My only complaint is the service can be hit or miss. Perhaps the  staff could use a little more training and it wouldn't hurt to hire more hosts to seat guests."}
{"text":"Date night - we sat out on their nice patio and enjoyed a lovely meal. We shared a generous portion of olives (appetizer), delicious escargot, and I had the butternut squash salad while my husband devoured the brussel sprout salad. Wine list is more than adequate - beer list lacks domestics. Servers were attentive and paid attention to the details. We shall return!"}
{"text":"Arrived for brunch today at approximately 11:30am; no other customers.  Sat on the patio and ordered a delicious brunch however was overshadowed by a multitude of flies!  

We cut our brunch short because of the flies-what a health hazard!  And when is the last time someone gave this place a good scrubbing?  The bathrooms are dirty with neglected maintenance-what a disgrace!

Clean up your act or the health department will close you down"}
{"text":"I went to Timo for the first time last week for Happy Hour.   I will definitely be back.  The service was excellent....Amy the bartender was extremely attentive and gave great suggestions.  The spinach pesto pizza with sun dried tomatoes and carmelized onions was off the charts.  It is an intimate lounge type setting, not too loud, great music and I cannot wait for the weather to cool off because the patio looks so comfortable and cozy with a few tables for 2 nestled in the trees....truly romantic."}
{"text":"it was okay.

We bought a groupon for this place and went on a sunday night. It was a small restaurant, nicely designed, and good ambiance. It took about 15 mins to get seated. Just nothing really stood out. We asked for suggestiosn from the menu and they told us to try the chicken and I really didnt think it was that great. Felt like chicken that could have easily been made at home rather than a fancy restaurant.

They did have a strong selection of wines and drinks. Maybe a better place for brunch or happy hour, but just for regular dinner nothing special."}
{"text":"Does not get enough credit. My first time eating here was the other day, the pizza was amazing!! The place was so very cute with great service! I hope it remains this way"}
{"text":"Love the vibe here and the food is great! Staff is friendly and attentive. Nothing like it in the area, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great meal.  Antipasta player chicken Blt fabulous.  Meatballs delicious  but small but worth nine.  Empty night but atmosphere feat for date night. Server attentive"}
{"text":"Love the food. Love the patio. Love the decor. Love that it is so close to our house. 
The bar is gorgeous. The food is great. They have a Brie soup that is to die for. My husband orders it every time we go there...The food is cooked in their pizza oven and is fabulous. 

Great wines too. I had an unusual white wine last night that was fabulous. 

I think I'd be totally happy with a glass (or 2) of wine, an order of their incredible bread straight out of the oven, and a bowl of brie soup!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place.  The food (particularlly the wings) is incredible, the drink list makes me happy (the balsalmic bloody mary is great), the brunch is excellent, the patio rocks, and best of all?  I'VE NEVER HAD BAD SERVICE HERE.

Hurray Timo.  Hurray."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places, currently to hot to sit out on patio but inside is to cute. Stopped in for a quick wine, and the Pinot Grigio was perfect.  Must try restaurant."}
{"text":"Pizzas were pretty good.  Eggplant appetizer was very good.   The lemon oregano chicken had too much lemon and not enough oregano.  A tually could not taste any oregano, only sage.  The green beans were under cooked and tough.   Atmosphere is great.  Wine is great. Staff is great. Weather was great.  We really enjoyed the salmon. Yes, we ate too much."}
{"text":"I never give 5 stars but this deserves more than 4 and the chef cooks at the wood fire oven in the middle of the kitchen so you can watch your food get cooked!"}
{"text":"Wondrous food & atmosphere! Amy is spot on as a bartender indeed :)  Keep the drinks coming too muahaha!"}
{"text":"I guess there's a reason to become a regular at certain places: Timo's offers several. The food is expertly and tastefully prepared; the environment is truly relaxing, whether outside by the fire pits or inside at a table or the bar, and the service is friendly and not obnoxiously attentive. If you sit at the bar you may learn something new and interesting from lovely and engaging Amy, the bartender.
It's  a nice neighborhood place that welcomes new faces, and hopes they'll come back."}
{"text":"I think this might be the spot. this place is so cute. Love the layout. :))) butttttt... let me start off by saying parking was ridiculous!!! Who has a parking spot that only has 8 spots... Omg. I parked right across the plaza from the gas station. We walked!!!! :(

We started off with the artichoke dip. It was fabulous. It was spot on creamy and hot. The bread with crunchy and it well with the dip. We also had the margherita pizza. Very declious :))

The waiter wasn't very helpful nor seem like he likes his job. I asked for new plates because the plates we have on the table was wet and muggy look. He took forever, so I went and got it myself. This was his response when he saw me get them \" thanks for getting them, (shaking his head) \" wow.  really?!? Oh there's more. So my girlfriend and I ordered the Creme Brule. He came over and had the torch to caramelized the top of the creme Brule. I said awesome, do you mind if I record this. He said \" wow, what is this world come to when you have to instagram everything\" seriously?! I just snarled at him.  Seriously,  the food was great, the dessert was delicious.  But this guy must be a joke... riight?!

I'll be back, but not to that kind of service."}
{"text":"Another visit to Timo.  As always, quickly seated and attended to.  Had my usual butternut squash soup and corn bread (not like regular corn bread...this stuff is insane!) 
and this time had diver scallops...with pesto.  Surprisingly delicious.  I had intended to ignore the pesto and ended up swiping the scallops in it!  And then, when I left and realized, 20 minutes later,  that I had left my phone there, I went zipping back.  The waiter had it tucked safely behind the bar and when he saw me came running over with it.  Great service and, as always, a great dinner."}
{"text":"I had my 30th birthday there this past weekend and could not have been happier with how accommodating the staff was and how well the whole night turned out. I received many comments from the guests about how great the 2 servers were with keeping the drinks fresh and the kitchen for keeping the assortment of food well stocked all night. Highly recommend the charming patio for any holiday party, birthday party, engagement party, etc. Thank you for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"Timo has a nice atmosphere out on the patio as well as inside the dining area. The food at this establishment may pleasantly surprise you.  I tried a Wood fired Lamb Kebab with cherry tomato and tzatziki sauce.  Next, I ordered Cedar Plank Ruby Red Trout with roasted cauliflower,  baby zucchini,  grilled lemon, caper butter. Also, I picked out a dessert Vanilla Tiramisu with lady fingers, berries and real whipped cream."}
{"text":"Took my wife for her birthday and it was amazing. I want to give thanks to Michelle she was on point."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time last Friday during happy hour. This is a cute and quiet spot. We ate inside because of the heat, but I can't wait to go back to sit on the patio they have. Started off with a glass of white sangria with peaches. Happy hour price of $4.00, this was so good. I was only able to drink half the glass since I was driving and it was very strong. I am looking forward to enjoying this again when I have a driver :). For appetizers we shared artichoke and spinach dip, it came with some toasted bread. This was the most delicious artichoke/spinach dip I have ever had. We also tried out some bruschetta. I had the one with prosciutto, mozzarella and pesto sauce. And also the one with green apples, brie and fig jam. I have no complaints about this place, service was great, food was good and happy hour prices were decent. I also loved the decor. I can't wait to go back and sit on the patio, enjoy some more sangria and taste the flatbread that looked A M A ZI NG . Our total bill for 3 glasses of sangria and 2 appetizers came out to $33.00, not bad at all."}
{"text":"Cute little place with awesome food and drinks!!!! Great location!!!! Amazing for romantic dinner!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a unique setting to have a Holiday party for my staff of 17.  Heinrich was gracious and accommodated my request to have the function on the patio with heaters and surrounding the large fire pit.  It was great!  The wait staff, especially Kristen, did a great job making sure everyone had what they wished.  I'm looking forward to bringing my wife and this time I can enjoy the wine menu too!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer at Timos for few years,food went from excellent to ok, to not good.tonite I got the worst,burned panini (half of if was charred)And old as dirt chips. When I told the waitress how stale the chips were she said \"they keep them out\"And offered a salad instead...well thank you ,but if you knew about old product being served,why did you bring it over?
I also mentioned my bread was burned..
Nothing on her part.screw you timo!So long"}
{"text":"Very cute place. My hunny and i stumbled onto this place one night and it was great. I had the pizza - excellent. 

Service was awesome - always checkin up on us but wasn't annoying about it. Cant wait to go back"}
{"text":"This place is cool!  I like how their patio faces away from the street noise.  And they have big firepits out there too.  Wine was good too.  I didn't try the food but we will try that next time.  Servers were friendly and prompt.  I wish they had the NFL Network because I was missing Thursday Night Football, but I get that's it's not a sports bar."}
{"text":"I must be a sucker for wine bars....they are just so good! I went to Timo after finding it on Yelp while hiking North mountain with my step mom Deb. We were hiking and, of course, thinking about food...lol. So we went to Timo, which is this cute little place that is largely hidden from the road by big trees. We sat on the patio for Sunday brunch. The service was great, very attentive and the atmosphere was wonderful....so relaxing. They didn't even treat us badly despite our being dirty and (probably) smelly. We shared the bacon and fig (?) pizza and the rocket salad. The pizza was HUGE and ridiculously good....the pizza was piled with bacon and sweet onions...so flavorful. The salad was also good...it had sort of weird dried raspberries and blueberries on it that were almost like croutons because they were crunchy but had the flavor of the fruit...yum. I would definitely come back here again...maybe next time I'll try the benedict (which also looked pretty fabulous)."}
{"text":"First time here..lasagna and a bottle of wine for 22 bucks..great deal..great food.great service. We will be back.."}
{"text":"Great value, outstanding food, tasty cocktails, what more could you ask for. Took the Mrs. out for a date and despite her general anger and cantankerous nature she was just as pleased as I was. Our waitress Alexis was a doll and captained the meal ship directly to tasty island!! Yar! But in all seriousness, highly recommend Timo!"}
{"text":"Have been here many times but this is a first for \"Timo Tuesday\".  The special was a glass of wine and one of their new summer appetizers, the Hummus platter. It was a little plate of goodness. It had a roasted garlic, spicy hummus with tomatoes, red onion, olives and feta with pita bread. We finished the night off with the Caprese Salad, which never disappoints. Well done, Timo !
Our server, Jaclyn was super friendly, attentive and always had a smile. Great job tonight, Jaclyn !"}
{"text":"Went  today for brunch at 10am.
I ordered Timo hash skillet it sound wonderful over easy eggs sausage potatoes well that's not what I got.
The eggs were hard and cold like they had prepared them earlier then reheated them 
There were 2 little potatoes no bigger than my thumb nail , 2 tiny pieces of burnt sausage and a puddle of grease served with cold toasted hard bread. I asked for butter and it was even harder than the bread.
I asked the waitress Alyssa for new over easy eggs she did bring back two of the same hard cold eggs congealed on the yolks. I don't think the cook knows how to make \"over easy eggs\"
Very disappointing $12.50 for nothing 
Also I was surprised they didn't have coffee ready had to wait about 10 minutes for them to brew coffee. Alyssa said she was the only waitress not a good experience"}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall gem. Very easy going atmosphere. Food is consistenly good. Thier half of weds wine and menu of boards is somewhat reminiscent of Postino without the crazy crowd. Had the crab cake benedict which was perfectly cooked. The smashed rosemary  fingerlings and aspargus were good and plenty. And the absolute best is the pach cobbler in town. Save room for dessert. Would give 5 but the roasted chicken came out a bit undercooked. Staff was very attentive and gave us free meal replacement and dessert. More then made up. My only complaint is the music on the patio. Few good songs then would be off for 30 min, then on go 2 more good songs. Music was great, it is necessary. Fix it!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the service was friendly, and the decor was pleasant without being stuffy.  In our party of four we ALL cleaned our plates (which is not normal for us). Two standouts were the fresh, warm bread with pesto (very good) and citrus butter (sublime) for an appetizer and the peach cobbler for desert.  We are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Our server Adrian should of taken the night off or dropped the attitude.  We have been there many times with great service, tonight not so much.  He had an attitude right  away because he was told to take our table as he was working inside.  It took him forever to get our order and when we asked what time happy hour was over and what time is currently was he has no idea only to come back ofter 6 and tell us we could not get happy hour prices.  I believe if you are going to work customer service you should be half way pleasant and not act like its a chore to service us especially adding your 20% to the bill which you would of NOT received"}
{"text":"Since one of the earlier bartender, Amy, was so consistently good it's tough to have a poor girl that seems unhappy to be there.  This newer bartender is competent and will get your drink but no conversation or even 'how's it going tonight?'  And I'm talking about during an empty bar and just few people at the tables, 3 couples.  It's been this way for the last year. I've mentioned her lack of personality to others that were working and they nod and say 'sorry'.  The happy hour used to be packed- no room at the bar with regulars and new comers, but now very few people are ever there.  I'm a big fan of the laid-back personality but not in this type of bar setting.  I like this spot better than Ladera but over and over we are disappointed with the lack of personality with the entire place.  There is a very sweet table server  that chats with everyone and brings a bit of life to the experience. Please, please - new bartender!?!  I hate to see this spot close but they must be losing business."}
{"text":"Can I just say one of the best patios in Phoenix. I love going Monday nights for a pizza an a bottle
Of wine.  The lights and candles in the patio make it such a calm and romantic place. 
I like to go for happy hours too and I the jar of cava sangria, artichoke dip, and the tapas are delicious as well."}
{"text":"Jasmine our server made great tequila drink suggestions. The Up in smoke was fun & different & I loved the Burro mules! Happy hour drinks and food are classy and delectable."}
{"text":"I have known about this place for a long time, but this was my first visit.  My daughter enjoys wine and we were looking for a light meal, so we thought we would try the bar during her visit.  

Roasted veggie board was good even if the root veggies could have been roasted a bit longer.  The scallops were great.  Meatballs were entirely boring; service with bread would have helped.   I will be back to try other items.  

Service was terrible, both servers came by to tell us the other was serving us.  Neither did until we pointed out their confusion.  A six-top was finishing their meal in the house, the patio was nearly full, we were virtually ignored.  Until what turned out to be an owner checked on us.  Thanks Jason for the rescue.  Sunday staffing is rough on a holiday weekend.  It would have been nice if the server had offered to help with a wine or beverage selection for my daughter.  

Great neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Timo has to be one of the best hidden places in central Phoenix. They have a great menu and atmosphere. I've had Alexis as my server a few times and she is the best! I would highly reccomend asking for her as your server! They also had excellent specialty drinks! 
Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Nice wine selection, bruschetta always good. More than anything, I love the ambience of this place. Used to come here when it was Bomberos. It's a great date night place, sitting by the fire pit, sampling wine and small plates."}
{"text":"all entrees were amazing! it was our first time and visiting from california. it was a nice family dinner with dessert and amazing servers and chef! will come again when i visit again"}
{"text":"What a cool experience!  Amazing patio... The service staff brings it,  so pleasant and helpful.  The bartender, Amy, is a borderline superhero behind a rocks glass and shaker! Definitely conning back : )"}
{"text":"Great wine, amazing food, awesome happy hour prices and wonderful staff! 

I recommend this place for anyone looking for a hidden away wine bar."}
{"text":"Every year the hubby and I go to the parking lot of Sunnyslope High and reenact our first kiss which took place in 1975.  We then go for a nice - hopefully romantic - meal at a local restaurant.  This year I made 9 pm reservations at Time which Yelp said was good and romantic.  We were seated out on the patio by the fire under a large tree.  It was a beautiful night with scent of orange blossoms.  Terrific!  We started out with a bottle of Max Mann Reisling which was crsip and cool.  We had tapas of mixed bar olives before our bruschetta.  We ordered the spicy copaiba, burrata and pesto, the sauteed mushrooms and brie and the apple brie as our 3 selections of bruschetta.  It was outstanding.  The flavors were terrific.  It was so good we ordered another tapas of Parmesan scallops as we finished our wine.  It was a wonderful and romantic meal.  The staff was very friendly.  We hope to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Second visit to Timo this week. Had to make sure I was not dreaming about the first visit. First of all, last night's weather was perfect for outdoor dining. 86 degrees on the patio and that's where my two guests and I dined. 
We started with drinks and proceeded to enjoy some Tapas. Mussels ($11.00) wings (not your ordinary bar wings) ($6.00)and a luscious Brie soup, so creamy ($8.00).Superb! 

I had the Pancetta Flat Bread. This is the second time having this entre ($11.00), friends split the Prosciutto sandwich with kettle chips. \"One of the best sandwiches I've ever had\" remarked Michael. And the Pancetta Flat Bread...I'm hooked!

We thought it would be a good idea to split a couple of desserts, chocolate Crème Brûlée ($6.75) and Peach Cobbler ($7.00). Wow.

Liked Bomberos...love the Timo's."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place more but they need a little TLC with their service. Atmosphere is a mix between a vig (arcadia) and postinos. Really cool fire pit makes for a nice loungy spot. Service is slowwwww. It seemed they only had 2 servers for the whole place. They were both rushing around and once tables got up to leave, tables stayed dirty and were never bussed...I suggest they get a server assistant to help run food! Things would go a lot more smoothly as a whole. Our server was very nice but he seemed so stressed! If you can't run a restaurant the right way, then why stay open. Bump up your staff so your restaurant can run the right way."}
{"text":"Update:After careful consideration, Timo's has reached out to me to indicate that they have removed their Foie Gras item.  I feel that this is a responsible decision based on their part and this reflects their standards as a business.  Therefore, I am removing my past rating and replacing them with what I truly feel that they deserve.  I will revisit and am more than positive that I will have a stellar dining experience.  Thank you, Timo's."}
{"text":"This is really more of a 3.5 star place than 4 but I'm feeling generous today. I love the drive up Central to this place as the homes remind me of where I grew up so it pushed it to the 4.

I've been to Timo twice now, once for lunch inside during the week with a girlfriend and most recently, with my fiance for dinner on the patio. I do remember thinking the place was really cute inside and I really enjoyed the patio at dinner, though it was a bit chilly the night we went and were never offered a heater. I didn't encounter flies on the patio as another yelper mentioned but I did have a tree just over head that was shedding it's needle shaped leaves that were all over our table and chairs when we arrived. The hostess never offered to sweep them off and just placed the menu's over them so we had to clear them off ourselves. Luckily none ended up in our food, at least not that I noticed or tasted :) 

We both ordered the butternut squash soup and I thought it was delicious! I even ate what my fiance couldn't because I thought it was so good. I opted for the oven-roasted chicken salad, which was good once I added another dressing option to give it more flavor and my fiance got the spicy salami pizza. His pizza was definitely spicy though because his nose was running and he was sweating but he said he enjoyed it! 

Service was pretty slow all night but that was okay since we weren't in any hurry and we had a mix of waiters throughout the evening. All in all, this place is cute and has pretty good food and I like the firepit on the patio. It would a good place to grab a few drinks and relax for an our or two even if you didn't want to eat."}
