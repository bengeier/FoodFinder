{"text":"Spring is in the air and Beef Butter BBQ is back smoking delicious BBQ.  Went back to try it again as Beef Butter opened  up shop in front of Woodman's Sun Prairie this past weekend.  They continue to offer samples before you buy.   The brisket was even better than I remembered. YUM!  I also tried the smoked chicken and that was great.  I had to get the brisket and also picked up some baby back ribs.  If you love ribs, you have to try these.  Melt in your mouth smoked deliciousness!   I'll be back this weekend for a smoked chicken meal.  Check their website \"Beefbutterbbq.com\" for where they will be."}
{"text":"We have visited outside of Woodmans several times. The brisket is amazing and the apple pie baked beans are out of this world! My kids beg for these beans and they are not typically bean eaters!!! Convenient to pick up after grocery shopping!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten Beef Butter BBQ several times now, and I've loved it. The ribs are my favorite, but the brisket, chicken and pulled pork are really good, too."}
{"text":"Food carts/Food trucks/Food trailers are all the rage...and rightfully so.  These wonderful bearers of culinary delights tend to focus on a narrow scope of food and attempt to do that scope the best possible, quite often achieving that goal to an extend, but sometimes you are rolling the dice on whether it will be good or not.

So while walking Shake the Lake long before any shaking was to occur, my friend and I decided to try a food cart or two at the venue.  We walked up and back, tried a sample here and there and decided that beef brisket would be the thing.  Our sample of the brisket was good, but not great, so we figured it would take some extra sauce to make this a stand out.  We were wrong.  Simple put...the BEST beef brisket either of us ever had.  We both went with the sweet sauce, but you could definitely get away without any topping.  The meat was tender and juicy.  There was minimal fat on the meat, but enough to give it flavor (and I NOT a fat person at all).  The meat was served on a small roll and that was delicious.  The apple smoked baked beans were outstanding as well.  This was the best fair/festival food I have ever had.

I liked them on Facebook so I can see where they will be next.  There story on their website is very interesting as well.

Bottomline:  try them the next chance you have - there will be little to no disappointment!"}
