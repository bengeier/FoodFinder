{"text":"This restaurant opened a few weeks ago in my neighbourhood and wanted to give it a try. Arrived at about 10:00 on a Saturday morning and ordered the following.  Deep Fried Donut Wrapped with Rice Noodles It is hot, even the plate is hot. The deep fried donut is crispy but a bit hard to bite.  Seaweed Rolls with Crab Meat The outer layer is crispy. The meat is a mixture of crab meat and fish paste. This dish is not too bad.   Siu Mai (steamed pork/shrimp dumplings) It is fancy. It has a shrimp on top of every siu mai. Usually you can't find a shrimp in this dish. This dish is good. Everything tastes good and right.  Steamed Bean Curd Rolls They are stuffed with many vegetables. Just a slightly salty to my personal taste. I would say another check mark for this dish.  When you check in at this restaurant, there's a special that you can order an item of Pork Bun for $1. When I presented the Yelp promotion to the waitress, she said I was not allowed to do so because I came in the period of time where they are offering a discount. But it is not written on the coupon that there's a limited offer at a specific time.   The restaurant offers free wifi and has the wifi password printed on the dim sum paper where you could check off which dim sum items I want to order. Tried many times but the wifi does not work. It is not the password error but the set up error, only certain type of users can use it.   Well, I had my adventure here. So long!"}
{"text":"Well ! I have been there on Sunday Afternoon !  I'm truly believed ! The owner doesn't know how to do restaurant business and he doesn't know people around that area !  Too Pricy for everything !"}
{"text":"Food was OK. The shrimp dumpling, siu mai and the squid are good.  Food was very fresh.  But the BBQ pork bun was very plain.  The salty egg yolk buns were lacking of salty egg yolk.  Service was OK.  However,  price was a little bit unreasonable.  This place is close my house so it will be one of my lazy dim sum place.  But if I am really in mood with dim sum well....  I wouldn't think I will eat here"}
{"text":"Dim sum 3 stars.  Overall 3.5 stars.  Hot Spot Chinese Cuisine is a new dim sum/Cantonese dining/hot pot restaurant in the Catherdraltown/Cachet neighbourhoods in Markham. It took over the location previously occupied by Noodle Stars.  The interior decoration has been thoroughly renovated; it looked nothing like how the store was before.  The color theme is red and dark brown, creating a dimmer and classy ambiance.  There are cubicles, similar to the ones in Congee Wong, plus some big round tables.  Green plants add a lively tranquility.    We had a lunch during their test opening.  Even during these early days, there were sufficient dim sum selections available.  I expected fresh ingredients from a restaurant that had just been opened, and Hot Spot passed with flying colours.  The dim sum tasted normal/well seasoned.  The stir fried noodle tasted bold and was well portioned.  Per menu, there is early bird dim sum special before 11am at $3.88 for S/M/L sizes.  The servers were friendly and polite.  The restaurant was still hiring, so services could be a bit slow.  I expect it be improved once it is adequately staffed.  Dinners and hot pots were not yet offered in the week that we visited.  We expect to return for dinner soon."}
{"text":"OK, this place is pricy. They do put a tea tab on your table, but I'm a little shocked to read the reviews below. To be honest, the food is not bad. I went at around 12pm for lunch and did not experience the poor quality that many people here seemed to have experienced. Yes, dim sum was a bit pricy but I was also here on an off hour so I don't expect to be paying ~$3.50 for a dim sum. They also did forget some of our order so I took off one star.  We ordered the chicken feet, golden egg bun, and honey garlic ribs with rice. Everything's flavour was on point. The chicken feet was marinated well and was extremely tasty. The golden egg bun was absolutely delicious. The yoke poured out of the bun which is the key to every golden egg bun. The flavourful bun was definitely the highlight of the meal. The honey garlic ribs were also amazing and meat was tenderized enough to tear off the bone.  Overall, it was an excellent meal with a rather heavy price tag. If you are looking to eat some tasty food...this is what you are paying for. If you are looking for an affordable lunch, I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food quality -siu mai: really juicy, big pieces of shrimp -beed rice noodle roll: barely tasted any beef and beef too mushy -rice noodle roll with dough stick: nothing special, but interesting how they sprinkled crushed nuts as garnish - Shanghai soup dumplings: Asian Legend has better ones... These ones the wrap is thicker and not much ginger taste  Atmosphere -pretty, looks a bit fancy for dim sum  Price - $3.88 SML before 1059am... A little pricey for this quality"}
{"text":"Should I be worried?  Hot Spot is not really a hot spot for dim sum even on a nice Saturday morning during Early Bird Special.  $3.88 for small, medium and large is one of the pricest around the area. Being a new business, they might just priced themselves out of the market at this price point. There are so many other options in the area: Skyview, Dragonboat Fusion, Shangri-la just to name a few.  We ordered 5 items and they were all pretty tasty and fresh. I can tell the ingredients used are good quality and do worth that price.  So we were there for a hour and there was just another table of 2. I really not sure how they can be in business if this continues.  For now they only opens till 4 pm serving dim sum only from a limited menu."}
