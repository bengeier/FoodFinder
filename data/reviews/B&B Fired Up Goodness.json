{"text":"Before going, I went to the website and checked the menu. Sandwiches, ribs, chicken, a real restaurant that serve BBQ products. This Saturday 1/14 night, on the Menu you have pizzas, tacos. No beef, no ribs, no chicken, no corn, no BBQ!!! I ask the waitress, she says, no we do no more ribs, but why on the site the Menu have all food you do not propose now? She don't know! Don't go there to eat BBQ. Site lie!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable deals and great tacos! I get the BBQ tacos and they are so delicious. I also get a boilermaker while I'm there - boy does that take me back! Only $4.  Great spot, definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Come for the tacos, and then also, stay for more tacos. This reformed pizza place has a ton of new BBQ options, but honestly, I haven't tried any of them because I keep ordering 15 tacos every. Single. Time. Plenty of beers to keep you feeling fine, and the wait staff is great. Fired Up Goodness? Fired Up OHMYGODTACOS."}
{"text":"This place may be using Hotlicks recipes, but Hotlicks it's not.  The ribs tasted like they were steaming for several days before being served.  And the atmosphere is college bar, smelling strongly of beer and slightly of pee."}
{"text":"Loved it! Great variety of beer on tap, including full pours on beers that at other bars you might only receive a 10 or 12 oz pour for the same price (or more)!  Tacos and queso were delicious. We each chose to mix and match multiple chicken, steak and shrimp tacos (they even have tofu). We will definitely be coming back and bringing more friends!"}
{"text":"The pizza may be back, and now we have Tacos not BBQ, but the old Bites and Brews still has the same issues as before. We went last night for dinner, browsed the menu, and after being underwhelmed left to go across the street to Harris Grill.   What bothers me the most is the company did such a great job with the switch back to The Elbow Room from 1947, yet is failing so hard with Bites and Brews / B&B."}
{"text":"This place is not bad, but it also doesn't stand out among all of The great restaurant options in Pittsburgh. We started with the queso dip with homemade chips, and split the 1/2 rack of ribs with chicken and a \"side\" of the Mac n cheese. Both the queso and the Mac n cheese are too spicy for most people, which was a bummer. The ribs are ok, but are a bit dry, probably due to the lack of fat and cooking process. The BBQ sauces (come in mild, medium and hot) are all very good, Memphis-style sauces. The portions are huge (expect to be filled up by the side portion of Mac n cheese). Good beer selection. Will be back for drinks, but maybe not the food.   However, we are from Memphis, so our standards are high for this sort of food."}
{"text":"Terrible service, took over 20 minutes to get one beer! Also the waitress had no idea what a negroni was even though it was on their menu. Won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"The pizza may be gone, name has changed, but still a great spot for excellent casual food and a fantastic beer selection. The new tacos may very easily be as good as the pizza was, and certainly something more unique in shadyside"}
{"text":"First time I've tried the new menu, shared nachos as an app and tacos for the meal, both were excellent. Pulled pork tacos in particular were delicious"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were wandering around Shadyside when we came across this great looking restaurant. The looks of the restaurant was much better than the prices and food. We bought 2 tacos, a burger, and artichoke dip. The tacos were 4$ a piece, and were very small, but they were good. The burger was great and reasonably priced. The artichoke dip was just okay, and overpriced. On top of that, our server was rude. She did not greet us, and she barely came by our table to ask if we're ready to order or if our meal was okay. At the time went to eat, the restaurant was dead, so she had plenty of time to stop by and talk to us. Instead she talked more with her coworkers. We were not impressed with this restaurants overpriced food and bad service."}
{"text":"BBQ pork taco.  Bomb.com yo.  Havn't been disappointed with anything I got yet.  Catfish and chicken are a weird combo but it works. Just make sure you be careful of the bones. Caught me off guard cause I was worfing it down like Garfield."}
{"text":"Goods: great happy hour with 1/2 off drafts. $5 burger is tasty for the price. Cheap tacos on Tuesday's  Bads: Service is sub-par. Dingy atmosphere.  Overall, not a terrible place if you're looking for a cheap happy hour spot for a cheap, decent craft brew"}
{"text":"Doesn't measure up to other neighboring BBQ like Yinzburgh and Union Pig and Chicken which are MUCH better choices if you're in the mood. Should have never changed concepts from pizza to bbq! Such a bummer! In my opinion, great place for a cold beer but nothing interesting at all about the menu."}
