{"text":"Service was terrible, food was mediocre at best. Would not choose to return."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews here, I was expecting something better than Sairam Om, at least as far as the service went... but that was a mistake.  The same dude was at the front of the restaurant as Sairam Om. This is not inherently a problem, but this guy is not very good at dealing with customers. I say this not only based on my previous experience at Sairam Om, but my experience on Dec 31st 2011. He takes the orders and he mans the front and the telephone (which rang incessantly for about 5 minutes on our most recent visit, and was eventually answered by the only other server). Basically he is not very efficient.   Here are the issues from my first ever visit to the \"new\" Aroma curry house-  ISSUE 1 - The other server came over to get our drink order in a reasonable amount of time after we got seated -- about a minute after he went away, our man from up front comes over to take the food order -- we order -- then he asks us what we ordered to drink, we say we already placed the order, he says \"I know, what did you get\", so we tell him and he stands there writing it down for about 1.5 minutes after we are done telling him.  Okay, I am no hospitality expert, but why can't he talk to the other server and figure this out, and also, why not go somewhere else instead of standing over our heads while he writes the order (4 drink orders don't usually take 2 minutes to write down, but to each their own)?  ISSUE 2 - We were 4 people, we ordered 2 dosas and 3 utappams amongst us. My dosa arrives -- 7 minutes pass before an utappam arrives -- about 10 more minutes pass before 2 more things arrive -- 5 minutes pass and the dude up front comes over to say the final item is arriving soon -- finally we are done eating and the last item (the second dosa) arrives, and gets placed in a to go container. I don't know if you have ever eaten dosas, but they don't taste very good reheated.  Incidentally I have had better service at Sairam Om, even the last time we went there, but walked out after being served stale papads and reheated samosas (hot outside, cooold inside).   Finally, on a positive note, the new menu looks nice and has nice offerings, the food was decent, my dosa (that I got to eat hot) was quite good, my idlis were reheated and not fresh, but they were decent and properly reheated, the sambar was a tad salty, but the 2 chutneys were great, the lassis were great, especially the salt lassi.  I absolutely love South Indian food so I am hoping (against hope) they improve their service and have more consistent food. I hope the new owners take note of the criticisms to make some changes. If they are indeed new owners, because based on the food and service I am sadly not convinced it's true...."}
{"text":"Did not expect such good South Indian food in the mid west. The dosas are made really well with very little oil and is an extremely healthy choice. The sambar is lip smacking good! We had the Mysore masala dosa and the plain masala dosa and they were both great. The people who work here are extremely friendly and make the overall experience a very happy one. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a late lunch here. The food was delicious and filling but be aware that this restaurant focuses on south Indian cuisine, so there is no naan on the menu (we had chapati instead). Although we were there late in the lunch hour we still received prompt and friendly service."}
{"text":"the food is good. The manager is a little funny. We (a group of 4) went to an empty restaurant on a sunday afternoon, and the manager seats us on a slightly cramped 4 seater. we request him to move to any bigger in the entirely empty restaurant, and he refuses. On protesting, he becomes aggressive himself. Later, the manager seemed to be in a hurry to have us leave. brought the check even before we done eating.   I am not going there again in a hurry."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  Although the waiter was friendly the service was SO SLOW.  From the time we ordered until we received our food 55 minutes had passed.  I had the chicken malabar and was not impressed.  The chicken was tough and chewy, my boyfriend had the curry house special biriyani and it came out very dark, almost dark grey in color.  Very little meat and the little bit he had was tough and chewy.  We were expecting so much more after such a long wait to get our food.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"It's great to still have a South Indian restaurant in the C-U area. The service was pleasant and attentive and the atmosphere was relaxed, bright, and friendly.  I came here for the first time on a recommendation from a friend and I was amazed at how good the food was! I ordered the sambar vadai for an appetiser and the portion size was perfect (although it was so delicious I would have eaten more!). The chutneys and sambar offered with the masala dosa were well matched and the prices were very reasonable for the quantity and quality of food. I would eat here every time I go out if I could."}
{"text":"I have been here when it used to be Sairam Om. I am of Indian descent and grew up eating a lot of indian/pakistani food. I am well aware of the cultural etiquette and the social norms of the society. The reason I mention all this is because of a terrible experience at Aroma Curry House that left a very distasteful taste in my mouth.   I was talked down to, disrespected, treated like a lower class citizen. Here is the story;  I walked into Aroma Curry House with friends of mine anticipating some good old home food. We arrived at and were seated at 6:30. I remember checking the time because the clock was right in front of me. No one attended to us, or asked us if we had any questions about the menu or anything. Hell, we didn't even get as much as water. We sat there till about 7:00 pm, that's half an hour, until my friend got up and asked a waitress to take our order. She finally came, and took our order, apologizing and telling us that the man in the front, i.e., the man who seated us had to take our order. We ordered an appetizer each, and a main course. My friend ordered a mango lassi, and the rest of us got water.   About ten minutes later, our water showed up. It had been about 45 minutes now, and all we had managed to obtain was water.  The experience so far was unprecedented in all of my dining experiences. Waiting so long for water?   Time ticked by, our stomachs ached, our anticipation for the delicious indian food grew. We started even talking about home (India/Pakistan) food, and how it takes so long to cook food. It was 7:30 by this time. It had been one hour, and we had yet to receive our appetizers. My friend approached the waitress who had taken our order and asked her when she anticipated our food would arrive. She said it just needed a bit of reheating and it would be on its way. REHEATING! A few minutes passed by, and two of our four appetizers arrived. The mango lassi appeared after. The waiter serving us the lassi seemed to be from the kitchen, and he seemed visibly scared. I think this was his first time serving anything. Our hunger had clouded our judgment and for a few minutes we forgot that we had been sitting here for over an hour. My friend got samosas, and another friend of mine got Sambar Vada. The Sambar Vada was  disgustingly cold from the inside. The samosas seemed to be freshly cooked, but had a tangy smell coming from them.   At this point my friend was really upset, and she approached the waitress asking her why it was cold and that this is terrible service. The waitress was very polite and told us that the man who greeted us in the front was supposed to be handling our food. so we should approach him. My friend went off to talk to him and he came back to our table.   My friend proceeded to tell him that we had been waiting for 30 minutes before we were even attended to, that we only got water 45 minutes later, and that our appetizers came in after an hour of us being there, and that it was cold! The man cut her off mid sentence and said condescendingly, \"let me tell you our business philosophy, we cook fresh food here, we aren't like other restaurants where we make all the sauces pre-made, and cook you a meal in under 20 minutes, okay? What can I do to make this better?\" My friend then said, \"what can you do for us\" He then said, \"I can give you a twenty percent discount on all the food, or the appetizers are free whichever one you want\" My friend to this was like \"Okay that's fine\" a friend sitting next to her also casually remarked \"the mango lassi came after the appetizers, and usually drinks come before the food.\" To this he condescendingly remarked,\"Well maybe we should just prepare everything before hand and serve everything as soon as you come in and not make it fresh, it takes at least 20-40 minutes to prepare a dish.\"  I wanted to lay out all the facts, because this guy was trying to make us look like it was our fault, and that we didn't understand his grand restaurant philosophy, and he was completely justified. So I told him, \" It has been 1 hour and 15 minutes. That's 75 minutes. it doesn't take 75 minutes to serve somebody appetizers. Nobody took our order or attended to us till we had been sitting there for half an hour.\"  He then snapped at me saying \" I told you how it works, you are trying to pick a fight with me, how you are talking to me is unacceptable, and I would rather you leave than have to deal with this.\" I told him whatever man, and my friends looked at me in shock at what he had just said. He was extremely rude and we left the restaurant. My friend who had not said anything to anyone about this stayed back to apologize because she felt bad. He was really rude to her too and said I could never come back.   If only he came to our table, and apologized for the delay, said they were busy, and he would do what he could to bring the food as quickly as possible, it would have made things better. He did not even do as much as apologize."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm giving this place a 5 not because everything about it is *absolutely amazing* but because overall I love this place. The food is always tasty, hot (spicy and temp), and fresh. I have only had vegetarian/vegan things on their menu, but I can highly recommend the paneer tikka masala and the vegetable korma. If you haven't had their spiced tea, it's definitely worth a try (but make sure you order it first thing, since it's handmade and steamed right then, it takes a while to cool down). And trust me, you will never leave hungry.   The service is, as everyone has said, always slow. Even when you are one of a few people in there, it will still be slow. Strangely enough, it's just as slow then as when it's jam-packed. But the people are wonderful and friendly and truly want your experience to be as good as it can be. They will work with you on items that aren't strictly on the menu if what you see isn't what you like, or you want some variety. Just don't go when you're already hungry, and make sure to go with someone you can stand talking to for a few hours, and you're good to go! And paying with cash gets you a nice discount, so I highly recommend you have some on hand."}
{"text":"Thumbs up just for being a South Indian restaurant. I am South Indian so there is no way I am going to compare to home cooked food. We drive quite some way just to have a night of satisfied full tummies. We have at times driven quite out of the way just to get take out and stock up our fridges for a few days!  The dosa and uttappam could be made more fresh and crispy otherwise the food is crave-able. Prices are completely reasonable and even cheap by Indian food standards. Got the standards North Indian dishes for those who aren't as adventurous as well. As a recommendation to spice-a-phobes, be sure to ask, and a lil secret from me....drink some yogurt if it does get to you! :)  Don't worry, it's all in good fun!  Champaign is lucky to have this place at it's disposal.   I will speak for colleagues who said the service is poor. However, in my personal opinion I have never been treated with anything but good service even during busy hours and late nights. I also called ahead when I knew we would be late and almost at closing and was greeted with a very easy  \"We are here for you\".  How could I not be pleased?  Docked one star because I feel like small changes in food quality could still be made and it would upgrade the place by a lot."}
{"text":"I had lunch here yesterday -- first time in the restaurant. My son and I were greeted and seated  immediately upon entering. We took some time to decide what to order. After looking at the regular dinner menu, we were then given the lunch menu. I ordered the Spring Dosa (served with sambar and chutney) and my son ordered Kozhi Milagu Kuhambu (Pepper Chicken) and mango juice.   Although I am not a huge fan of Indian food, I will say that my dosa was very good -- flavorful and a just a bit spicy. My son seemed to enjoy his chicken dish.  The atmosphere in the restaurant was nice, although it was a bit dark inside. The food took longer than anticipated. We were initially given the wrong check. These were all minor annoyances.  Despite not ordering extras, I thought this meal was more than I would normally expect lunch to cost."}
{"text":"Used to have family Dosa there. Now that option is not there. Service has deteriorated, which is sad. The decor is nice, and some things still taste great (such as Dosas) but really, the sambhar is a hit or miss."}
{"text":"5 stars for food. By FAR the best Indian food in C-U!!!! I've been a loyal patron of Bombay Grille for years and just tried Aroma - the food is SO delicious, creative and affordable. Be prepared for slow service, but it's WORTH it. Also our food didn't arrive at the same time - so perhaps be prepared to share your curries while you wait!"}
{"text":"I have yet to find good Indian food in Central Illinois.  Someone recommended the Aroma Curry House so we decided to give it a try.  We were one of the only tables in the restaurant but the service was painfully slow.  My husband ordered a beer and it took so long we were tempted to just walk over to the case and grab it ourselves.  I don't normally complain about service, but it was just out of hand.  As far as the food itself goes, it was alright.  My in-laws loved it but they hate spicy food.  I found my chicken tikka masala to be pretty bland.  If I'm looking for bland, I don't normally go for Indian.  Someone else got a dosa and it hardly had any filling at all.  I've had dosas many times and I've never had a dosa with so little filling.  Maybe it was an off night, but I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"The south indian food is ok. Not anything your indian friends will rave about, but decent.  They have dosas and other south indian specialties.  Seems they have idlis on the menu, but no longer serve them in any form.  Of the indian restaurants in champaign, this is probably the best, but the competition is poor."}
{"text":"This place is in the same location as Sairam Om -- in fact, I think it's the same owners and same menu.... just different name.   Anyway, I went in at 11:30 and ordered a mango lassi and a chicken tikka dosa.   I was the only one in the restaurant and the waiter/host was very polite.   He went into the back to get my water.  Meanwhile, this blond woman smacking gum in her mouth comes into the restaurant (waits for all of two seconds) and starts talking to me..., \"HELLO!? HI?!\"   I turn around and wave at her and continue to read my book...., \"HELLO?!\", Yah... she thinks I work there because I look Indian... good for you lady, I'm Filipino.   The waiter comes back out and tends to her, and she shouts to me, \"OH SORRY, I THOUGHT YOU WORKED HERE\".  Anyway, the waiter tells her that her takeout isn't ready and she needs to wait.  Sometimes I think karma can come and bite people in the arse because she waited for a while and started getting this snooty attitude when things aren't served to her at McDonald's speed.   Now, back to my lunch.... the lassi came out and it seemed to be a powdered mixture because it tasted pretty gritty..... and then when the chicken tikka dosa came out, it was sliced into three parts (I was a little disappointed, because I was looking forward to that great big long dosa!!) and it was served with just the sambar.   The waiter said he'd be right back with the chutney and that condiment that I can never remember the name of.   But, by the time he came back with the two condiments, I had about two bites left...... and I was eating slowly.   In the meantime, the restaurant had gotten 6 more patrons in and the waiter/host was dealing with them one at a time..... VERY SLOWLY.... which was why my condiments came out in an untimely manner.  I'd hate to see what happens to the poor guy when it gets really busy!  The dosa was pretty good, but whoever made it (the cooks in the back seemed to be of the caucasian nature) figured it would be a nice touch to add raw red onion to my dosa which was very overpowering.  It was probably at least half a red onion..... and the fact that it was split into three made me think that the chef wasn't Indian at all.....   I've eaten many dosas in Toronto, NYC, NJ and I've never once seen one cut into thirds.   But anyway, the crepe was good, the chicken tikka was good but lose the red onion garnish next time -- two hours later, and I can still smell the onion on my breath!! Ugh!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible (very very slow)---and they weren't that busy.  They seated us and then we waited a bit for water.  They didn't come to take drink orders for probably 15 minutes.  We went ahead and ordered at that time too as it seemed they might never come back.  We had our 18 month old son with us- he is very good at restaurants but this was getting a bit ridiculous for him.  Portions were decent- but I didn't think the food was great.  Once we finished, I went to the car with our son while my husband waited to pay and it took at least another 15-20 mins for them to drop the check.  Honestly, I won't go back."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite for Indian food. That egg biryani is out of this world. The service is top tier and for the love of all that is holy...get the chicken 65!!!"}
{"text":"Pricing was very reasonable.  Unpretentious atmosphere.  Amazing mutton biryani with very fragrant cardamom infused basmati rice.   Excellent parotta.  Located in a strip mall.  You have to look for it.  Worth any detour."}
{"text":"Probably best tasting Indian food in town.  Food is really interesting as Southern India is not the usual restaurant fare.  The food is prepared to order and the staffing is minimal (probably family run) so the pace is leisurely.   If I went to this restaurant in Europe I would say the pace would be typical.  For Americans who expect to turn the table in half an hour for lunch it might seem a bit slow."}
{"text":"We're big fans of all foods Indian. We were regulars at Basmati and Sairam Om, and now at Bombay Grill. We're going to be regulars at Aroma Curry House, too, but with even greater enthusiasm. Aroma Curry House, at the former location of Sairam Om at the Village at the Crossing (Champaign), has new owners and new decor, but employs many of the same people, from waiters to cooks. The food is even better (and Sairam Om was good), and the service problems seem to have been ironed out. The decor is lighter and more modern; it's a pleasant space.  The food continues to be Southern India, with an emphasis on the Chettinad region: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chettinad_cuisine. Vegetarian dishes are available with good variety, as well as protein dishes including egg, fish, chicken, and goat. Entrees range from tender, braised proteins in full-bodied yogurt based sauces to dry-spiced roasts of extremely flavorful protein and veg.  The spice profile is earthy, with plenty of onion, garlic, chili paste, and ginger. One of the best features is the fresh curry leaves found in many of the dishes.   The soup starter is Rassam, which has the medicinal purpose of preparing the digestion for the meal to come -- it's an intense broth redolent with peppers and spice.  For appetizers, we had the Masala Dosa and Gobi 65.  Gobi 65 is  an earthy, spice-coated fried cauliflower served with lemons and red onions, with dipping sauces (tamarind, mint, and tomato) on the side.  It was the best Gobi 65 we've tasted.  The Masala Dosa is a large crispy crepe stuffed with mildly spiced potato. For those who love spice, this dosa may seem on the tame side, but it benefits from the three toppings, including a peppery, broth dip; a rich coconut paste; and an equally rich and flavorful peanut paste.  Dosas have a wonderful texture, too, with their soft fillings and crispy wraps (to eat, roll up and cut into pieces).   We loved our entrees, both chicken-based.  I had a dry rub that was intense with masala, onions, and curry leaves and  my husband had a yogurt curry with a tomato-infused sauce.  We enjoyed flatbread and chai tea with the meal, and the tea was especially good.  For those who used to get chai at Basmati, this tea tastes just the same, like an old friend we'd missed.  Prices are reasonable, too.  The restaurant is in the medium range for dinner in CU, with entries averaging from $11-$13.  Portions were generous -- a good value.  If you are taking kids, order them the butter chicken.  Ours is a fan, and he's a picky eater.  We're delighted a new Indian restaurant has come to CU, especially one that is so very good!"}
{"text":"Waited one hour and forty minutes for  the food to be served. It was shrimp biriyani worth $15.99.  It was  the worst biriyani i have ever had. Stalty and does not taste good at all.   Not only this, been there couple more times on friend's request; they always take at least an hour to serve the food. Food is not worth the time (not in this place ! no !)"}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, and close to home.  How can you beat that.  I have only gotten carry-out so I can't speak for dinning in."}
{"text":"I was delighted to find out how delicious this restaurant is.  The menu is full of really good items, like dosa, butter chicken, vadao , uthappam, paneer butter masala and vindaloo. Best Indian food in town, althought i wish it were more centrally located. It is a bit of a drive for me. the service is excellent and the staff very nice."}
{"text":"The best Indian restaurant in town! I love this place! Exceptional customer service as well. I always get the curry house special biryani."}
{"text":"Last time I when to Aroma curry house I had an entry for the first time called Poori with aloo masala. Absolutely fantastic!!!  I had this meal and a drink from the lunch menu and walked out of the restaurant spending only $10 after tip and I was completely satisfied I ate enough.  I recommend this place to anyone who love indian food"}
{"text":"This business succeeded Sairam Om. The menu is exactly the same. Even the people are same (as much as I can recollect). The only thing that changed is the price. They took the old menu, increased the prices by about 20% flat and changed the name.  The food is pretty ok. If you prefer spicy food, just dont ask the waiter to make the food spicy. All they do is chop up some thai chilli and mix it in the already prepared food. This will just burn your mouth and adds no flavor.   the place is almost always under staffed. so service is spotty, but the waiters are very courteous.   i was happy to hear this place was reopening, even though under a different name, but after being there once, i wouldnt be willing to go back. those prices are higher than anything I have ever seen.   $14 for biryani is the costliest I have ever paid and I have been to many Indian restaurants (of this category) in many metro areas. Even Bombay gril prices them on the high side for a below average preparation.   too bad. i honestly believe C-U area can support at least two more indian restaurants - they need to be in good location, offer good food and price it reasonably."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Tuesday night. The food was decent, but not above average. Since this is Southern Indian food, some of the items I was more used to seeing were not on this menu (i.e., Naan bread). I had decent service and did not experience the slowness that other reviewers did. The decor was scant, and there was not much ambiance. Might be better for just take out, but overall is a decent option for Indian in west Champaign."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to read the negative reviews about this place. My friend and I came here for dinner last night, and we fortunately did not experience any of the issues listed below.  In any case, let me preface this by saying that, until recently, I would rather starve than even smell Indian food (and I eat just about anything). But then my friend's grandmother (force) fed me her homemade Indian food, which led to the following revelations: a) there is such a thing as delicious Indian food, b) my friend's grandmother is from South India, c) most Indian restaurants actually serve North Indian cuisine, so therefore d) perhaps Christine can actually *gasp* enjoy (South) Indian food??  So when I heard there was finally a South Indian restaurant in town, I was cautiously optimistic (read: jumping giddily up and down. And I did it in front of my boss. Oy.). And this place did not disappoint. The food (chicken tikka uthappam for me, and chettinad vegetable kurma for her) was delicious: the uthappam was flavorful without being overly spicy, and the sambar and chutney that came with it were particularly delicious. My friend's curry was also very good, and was filled with a hearty mixture of vegetables including cauliflower and (I think) peas and carrots. The portions were generous, and though we were both able to finish our entrees we felt quite full afterwards. Furthermore, the waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and patiently answered our many questions, and our food was served promptly. The servers were also very attentive, and despite the restaurant being busy they refilled our water glasses no less than three times throughout the evening.  Overall, a very nice dining experience. The ambiance is soothing and pleasant without being overly formal, and even though my friend and I chatted for about two hours, we never felt rushed or hurried. I would definitely recommend the entrees we ordered, and I have heard good things about the biriyani as well...which means I'll just have to go back and try it myself!"}
{"text":"I used to go this restaurant with family/friends from bloomington. Nice place to dine. I like the big dosa and the music played when it is being served. Try this if you go with family. One important dish to try is \"kothu parotta\". I have recommended this to my friends and everyone liked it."}
{"text":"Restaurant review I finally had a chance to come here for a weekday lunch to try the \"Chennai Saappadu\" which is the 8 course lunch meal. For 7.99 this is a deal if you like variety. This includes a cup of basmathi rice, a chapathi (wheat flour tortilla the equivalence of naan), sambar (pigeon pea stew), mulligatawny, dhahi (yogurt to cool of the burn from the spice), vegetable koottu, and a choice of veggie curry or non-veggie curry (the butter chicken was quite delicious), and appalam (tortilla chip like thing). It did not come with any pickles. For 2 dollar more you can get a mini appetizer and rose milk or gulab jamun. The mulligatawny or the sambar was very spicy. Otherwise the other dishes were quite a nice variety. One major issue is that the dishes themselves don't contain a lot of curry so I found myself just putting in the vegetable koottu into my rice and using the chapathi to dip the curry. The yogurt was a nice way to knock down the heat. So in summary, nice variety and spices, but lack of protein is a huge downer with the meal  Pros: quick service, lunch special with a large variety, south indian cusine  Cons: lack of curry and protein with the lunch special  Hidden deals: 7.99 for the Chennai Saappadu 2 dollars more for dessert and appetizer with the meal"}
{"text":"First of all, let me say I have been spoiled by going to many Indian restaurants in Chicago. So that being said, this place wasn't quite as great as some of the other ones I've tried, but it'll do just fine for this area.  My boyfriend and I stopped in once and were the only people there for the most part. We ordered and I thought the butter chicken was good, but the bread had to have been my favorite part. Everything was quite spicy, which I really enjoyed, but I could see how others might not. All in all, I'd definitely come back for a second meal, I just hope this place is still around by the time that happens."}
{"text":"I'm torn about this restaurant. The food is authentic South Indian food, and they have amazing dosa!  My husband and I were disappointed with the customer service though.  We went in at 2:15, knowing they close at 2:30 everyday until dinner time. I got the Thali lunch special, and my husband got the dosa.   When the server brought me my food, he told me that it was 2:30, so they were closed and I should eat fast. His words. Please eat fast. I've been to a lot of Indian restaurants, including ones in India and Singapore, and I've never had a server tell me to hurry up and leave.   The food was good, The chicken curry was deliciously spiced, although there were a few bits of cartilage in the chicken. The staff ignored us after we got our food.    They have good food; a little customer service would go a long way. And if they really want everyone out by 2:30, then they need to stop seating people at 2:00."}
