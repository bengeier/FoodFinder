{"text":"Clean remodeled location with friendly staff and fresh ingredients. Only had breakfast but it was yummy and a few twists like a breakfast salad, eh!"}
{"text":"What a cute little place for lunch we happened upon while driving approximately 1-1/2 hrs west of Sudbury. 

An expansive menu for a quaint little bistro. Had their Eggs Benedict with home fries and coffee; husband had cheese omelet with home fries and coffee. Service was quick, friendly and efficient. 

The chef/Mom of the servers came over to introduce herself to us which was a nice touch. 

We found the prices reasonable & the food top-notch!

The washrooms were immaculate & quaintly decorated. 

They are a breakfast/lunch restaurant  open until 3 PM daily except Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Amazing REAL food on the trans Canada!   Enjoyed the whiskey sweet and sour pulled chicken sandwich here.  My partner in travel, the artichoke something or other.  Staff is friendly, washrooms clean and its just such a nice find.  If you are on the road, or live near by, give the place a shot!"}
