{"text":"I had the souvlaki pita combo which comes with rice, salad and fries. Everything was delicious. The rice was easily the best I've ever had, and the salad and fries were great too. And the pita.... oh my. Best in town, hands down!"}
{"text":"By far the best souvlaki I've had ... rice, salad, everything was amazing... go for it you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This shit is the bomb! I love the pitas, with soft chewy pita bread, delicious savory gyro and souvlaki meat, and heavy on the toppings - you need a napkin. I also like the Elatos salad, fresh tasting with big chunks of good feta. The handful of times I've ordered, the delivery drivers are pleasant and arrive really quickly. Woohoo, so glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend were on the hunt for best gyro in montreal and we saw this on yelp with good reviews! And wow! Im from t.o. and i would say its one of the best gyro ive ever i would definitely recomend this and bring my friends on out next visit"}
{"text":"Elatos is by has the best greek Gyro and souvlaki pita in Montreal. This place has been around for decades and whenever i pick up food from there its always as expected. Amazing!"}
{"text":"A hidden treasure and a landmark.

This place might not be much when inside but what they cook up is really solid.

The gyros are superb and are offered with fries inside (get it). The burgers are a nice greasy hangover cure. Their subs are really filling as well.

If in the mood for Greek style pizza with blots of heavy toppings, get an all dressed and one slice will equal two anywhere else"}
{"text":"Amazing gyros and souvlaki plates! Generous portions. Always fresh. They deliver within a reasonable timing!"}
{"text":"Souvlaki is one of the best things about being in Montreal. And smoked meat, and bagels.. But you come to Elatos for the souvlaki and gyro. It's consistently excellent. 

The dining area is cramped, if you live in the area you can treat yourself to delievery but it can take a long time during peak hours. Average times are 45 minutes to an hour, from our experience over the years. 

If you place a take out order, confirm the order and check it when it arrives! On many occasions orders have been wrong but they're quick to correct.

Dining area is small, with 3-4 large booths. In-house service is fast but with the open grill, it can get very foggy.

Overall,an excellent place to grab a quick lunch and, hands down, treat yourself to the souvlaki, that's the star attraction, here. 

Best bet is to get a takeout order and head to nearby Jarry Park for a picnic. Summer done right! 

4 stars for the food, minus 1 for still not having an effective POS for orders."}
{"text":"Howdy!

A tiny restaurant in Parc Ex, family-run since before you were born. They make awesome souvlakis and gyros. For an extra buck you can get them done \"Elatos Style\" which adds french fries on top. of a killer tzatziki. They also serve pizzas, which I am aiming to try next time I'm there.

The restaurant itself is inviting and warm (actually hot due to the grill and the oven) in an 80s kind of way. Complete with the original travel posters of Greece, the only way it could be more old-school is if they went out and hired some fancy designer and spent thousands of dollars to make it look like it was straight out of 1984.

Beyond the taztziki, the souvlaki is tender and tasty, gas-grilled, they clearly use fresh pork. However, the gyro was the clear winner of the afternoon. Obviously handmade, it is about as far from one of those industrial behemoths that you find in most Greek chain restaurants.as we are from the Greek Islands. The flavor and texture was marvelous and made me realize how good a gyro really could be."}
{"text":"Fantastic Gyro! 
Easily the best I have ever had. 
I often drive across the city to satisfy a craving."}
{"text":"Best GYRO I have ever had in Montreal. Nothing beats it. Their rice is also fantastic. I would also recommend the Subs and surprisingly their Pizza, next time you think about ordering Miss Jean Talon..get a pizza from Elatos instead I guarantee you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Small comfortable restaurant for a good Greek standards. They are know for Gyros and Souvlaki and I tried both. I shared both of course, I'm not a glutton. Lol. That said, the food was fresh and delicious. The meats were moist and the salad and rice were prefect. It is obvious to see why they have a four star rating. It was all very good, but is was no Marvin's. Convenient and inexpensive.... And I am very excited to try their subs and pizza, they are supposed to be very good as well."}
{"text":"If you are hungry and want good food, this is the place to order from. I've only ever ordered delivery, but the food is insanely good, fast delivery time and very well priced. Recommendations: gyro with the Elatos salad, Elatos sub or Elatos poutine."}
