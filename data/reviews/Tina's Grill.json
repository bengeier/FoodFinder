{"text":"The atmosphere is very friendly.  It was my first time in there.  I ordered the burger because I think a burger is a good barometer of how good the rest of the menu items will be.  The menu stated the patty was specially seasoned.  I was starting to think I found my new favorite spot.  Then the burger came.  The patty looked like it was very generic and previously frozen.  It was too small for the oversized bun.  They really skimped on the condiments.  One very small tomato slice, onions, and a little bit of lettuce.  That was it.  It took four bites to finally hit the tomato.  On my first bite I knew I was in for disappointment.  The patty was very dry and tasteless.  The bun was also very dry and gave me the distinct feeling it was four or five days old.  I can't remember the last time I had to take sips of a drink just to get a burger down.  The fries had the same taste and texture as McCain's frozen fries.  It was a pretty disappointing food experience.  I felt it was overpriced for what I had.  Soft drink and the burger came to almost $14.  It felt like more of a $7 meal.   However, I think I would go back if I was looking to have a beer with a friend somewhere close to home."}
{"text":"Great little pub for a bite and a pint. Tina is a lovely lady that will make you feel right at home. On your own, as a couple or with a few friends. It's all good. Nice specials each day as well."}
{"text":"Amazing wings, and I love the Caesar salad wrap, best wrap ever! I give it a 10 out of 10, the fires are to die for!"}
{"text":"Great wings, best nachos I've ever had! The burgers, wraps and pub grub are awesome :)"}
{"text":"Heard from a friend that Tina's Grill offers wings special Tuesday and Thursday so we ordered 2 lbs for takeout. We got the Dry Cajun and the Maple Bacon. They also have other flavours such as Mild, Medium, Spicy, Honey Garlic, and Thai Chili.

The shop is very small and is mainly operated by 1 person at the front and 1 person in the kitchen, so service can be very slow. For getting our takeouts, we literally had to call multiple times for someone to pick up and take our order, and the wait was roughly 30mins to get our food. 

The portion size was good, it was 8 wings per lb. The flavour decent, I think I liked the Dry Cajun more. For the Maple Bacon, at first I thought it was going to be saucy but it turned out just be powdered spices, much like the Dry Cajun. However, they clearly didn't put enough Maple Bacon spices on the wings and the little spices that were there weren't spread out evenly either. 

PS. the smell of the Maple Bacon was really pungent that it lingered in the house even through the next day."}
