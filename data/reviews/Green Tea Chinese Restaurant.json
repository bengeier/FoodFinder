{"text":"1st time here. Not friendly at all. Chef was eating lunch when i walked in. He got up to go cook with a full mouth of food.  Okay dining area..floors look very dusty. This place is new right? White walls are scuffed n dirty...chicken not tender, was rubbery. Yummy fountain soda.  Compared to other places serving size was a bit smaller. This is. Last resort spot to eat."}
{"text":"We haven't found good Chinese food in Phoenix. I'd basically given up, but after Green Tea opened we decided to give them a try. The food here was surprisingly good. We got orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken. Kids and I liked both. Order was ready really fast."}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from here on numerous occasions, the delivery is always on time, if not early and the food is always hot. They do a great job of providing the food according to my instructions (prepare spicy). The portions are comparable to the price and I have always enjoyed the food I've ordered."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in tonight for the first time.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!  I've never had such a delicious eggroll - The sesame chicken was so crispy and flavorful.  I'll definitely be back again soon.  The combo prices were very reasonable too."}
{"text":"DO NOT try to dine in here, I stood there for 5 minutes while the lady attened to 2 phones and never even acknowledged me. Then when she had time for me, she was not very attentive and almost rude.  I never got to try the food, so I can't comment on that.  This should thought of as take out only."}
{"text":"Every dish I've ordered has the same brown sauce and over cooked vegetables. Garlic sauce, teriyaki sauce, Mongolian it's all the same at this place. It's really not good! I can't understand all the good reviews , the food is chewy, meats are bad quality, and just yuck yuck yuck! I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time Friday night, hands-down best Chinese food I have tried in AZ, the Orange chicken was made with quality chicken, Lo mein, fried rice and egg rolls were amazing, good portion sizes... Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!   This place opened up down the street from where I live and I've been meaning to try it out.  Finally tried it today. Another family run place which I love!  Walked in and it's very basic, 4-5 tables, smaller place.  We ordered the fried tofu lunch special and the beef chow fun.  Being Chinese, I'm critical of Chinese restaurants because my family owned many and I'm used to home cooking.   

We were brought out a basket of fried wonton chips and a small container of sweet and sour, my gut told me that this wasn't a good sign, this was going to be a Panda Express experience.  

The meals came out, food was served on 9\" dinner style plates and there was no shortage of food. The tofu was crispy and firm. The veggies were crisp. The brown sauce was tasty, not some sweet brown sauce found at Panda Express.  The chow fun was awesome!  Very flavorful!  Noodles had a good crispy edge but still soft. 

Out the door with food leftover for less than 15 bucks!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and cooked right when you order it.  We've been here numerous times and have not been disappointed.  Yes, it can be a challenge ordering sometimes due to English being a second language, but how about some appreciation for it being authentic Chinese food?  They will improve their service over time.  In the meantime, good food, good portions, fair price."}
{"text":"This place is definitely better than most Chinese places in the valley but definitely not the best Chinese food I've ever had...the food was kind of bland, if the flavor was stronger then it definitely would've gotten 5 stars from me...I ordered the Triple Delight & Egg Drop Soup...the portions were pretty big except for the crispy noodles that came with the soup, wish it had more flavor & had more...the egg drop soup was alright, it's just plan egg, no carrots or peas, & it could've been saltier...the Triple Delight was pretty good, just wish the sauce had more flavor...overall it was alright, most likely I'll try this place again..."}
{"text":"Hidden gem of Ahwatukee! Very reasonably priced for how much food you get. You might wait for a bit sometimes but that just shows that everything is made to order. Tons of options and never salty or fake tasting, just good authentic chinese food! I especially love when they have their kids working up front because those girls are so sweet and attentive! I eat there at least once a week."}
{"text":"Nothing too special about this place. The service was prompt and pleasant yet the food was mediocre at best. The lack of authenticity was surprising! I ordered the kung pao chicken lunch special which came with hot and sour soup and rice. The chicken used in this dish was battered and fried, similar to the chicken used in orange chicken. Typically kung pao chicken uses a grilled and stir fried chicken breast. Regardless, I still gave it a try and after the first bite I needed to refill my water because my taste buds were submerged in salt. The hot and sour soup was decent and the rice was good. Considering the simplicity of steamed white rice, it is quite difficult to mess that up. Overall, I was disappointed with the kung pao chicken and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Cannot comment on the food because we left before we could be served.  That is the problem.  Arrived on a Thursday night to order some food to go.  Did not order it over the phone, and waited at least ten full minutes before our presence was even acknowledged by restaurant staff.  There was only one table of patrons in the place at the time. A woman waiting in line in front of us said that she had been standing there waiting for her to-go order long before the single table of seated guests had arrived, and they were already eating their order, not a take-out order, but what they ordered after they arrived.  Once we were finally acknowledged, we were told it would be another 25 minutes to receive our requested take-out order.  Disgusting service and attitude, so we ordered take away from another Chinese restaurant in the nearby area, left, drove to the other restaurant less than ten minutes away and our entire order was waiting for us when we arrived."}
{"text":"Tried this new place for the first time Jan 2, 2016. Ordered over the phone and food was ready when we got there.  The place was nice & clean. There were several people waiting for food & a few that were waiting to order. A good sign I thought. We got beef & broccoli with white rice,  veggie Lo mein, and egg rolls. We liked all of our food. The only weird thing was I thought I smelled a fishy smell on my beef. As if it was cooked in a same pan with fish. Hmmmm. Not good if u don't really care for fish.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I expected better shrimp fried rice from this so called authentic Chinese restaurant. May not ever visit here again. The rice seemed like it was microwaved and thrown into a to-go box. Not cool."}
{"text":"Very impressed with my first experience. Placed an order for delivery, everything was correct, well presented, promptly delivered, and absolutely delicious! Combination fried rice, pork lo mein, seafood in garlic sauce, sesame chicken and egg rolls. Rave reviews by all! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Very good food and and nice people. I had the orange chicken. It was really good. 

I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Just came in the mail - an extensive menu with delivery - that's a plus!  This location used to be really fresh salad place and some of those items are incorporated into this menu so I'm hoping its the same family and they just expanded their offerings.

Decided to dine in for our first experience since delivery does diminish the quality a wee bit - can't be helped!

Excellent crisp fresh vegetables in every dish.  Shrimp was plump and not over done.  Chicken in the General Tso and the Curry was tender and tasty.  Hot & Sour soup had nice complexity and just enough spiciness to be enjoyable on a cold night.  GREAT wontons came with the soup (thanks). Homemade Hot Mustard - THE BEST!     
Very fair pricing, good service in house, very solid menu offerings - we will be back.  Welcome to Ahwatukee!"}
{"text":"No green tea , no hot tea.  The lady didn't speak English .  Food was ok.  Don't think I'll be back ."}
{"text":"Better than average fast Chinese food restaurant. 
I had the shrimp chow mein and it was chuck-ful-of fresh crunchy vegetables and good plump shrimp. 
They mean business with their hot & sour soup! 
Their servings are enough for take home bag or splitting if you order an app or egg roll to go with it. 
Can't beat the prices for the amount of food they give you. 
I love the Green Tea Family Dinners menu they offer. Check it out! 
Serious language barrier with most staff."}
{"text":"This is a great little hole in the wall. We've ordered from here a few times over the last few months and we always get fast friendly delivery with great tasting food. I really don't know why this place doesn't have better reviews."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food and good service this is more of a typical real Chinese meal not American Chinese.  Not my go-to first choice for Chinese food but good second choice."}
{"text":"I ordered crab won tons, sweet and sour shrimp, hot and spicy shrimp and vegetable fried rice. The crab won tons tasted of stale overused oil so I only ate two before throwing the rest away. The sweet and sour shrimp was under cooked, when I bit into one the batter was still slightly raw on the inside. The hot and spicy shrimp was decent but even though I ordered it spicy (they gave an option on level of spiciness) it still wasn't very spicy. The sauce was nicely flavored though and it came with lots of veggies which I liked. The fried rice was just ok, neither bad nor really good. I probably wouldn't eat here again but chose to give it a try because they delivered to my home. I will keep searching for a favorite Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious!!  The food is freshly prepared and they also offer smaller portion sizes instead of only large.  I've tried this place 3x's and I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst Chinese food I have ever had. I couldn't tell if it was the oil they used or something in the breading mixture on the sweet and sour pork I ordered. I had to throw the food out I ordered for pick up after a few bites--horrible. Can't imagine they will be there for long."}
{"text":"What a find this is, first Chinese place we have tried since moving here from Chicago last year, and what a pleasant surprise it was. It may be, no make that definitely is the best Chinese carry out that we have ever had. Everything we tried was great, you will not be disappointed if you are looking for some great Chinese food to bring home."}
{"text":"Decent food but I practically have to beg for extra soy sauce every time I order. I know it's only a small issue but it's annoying. So annoying that I'm leaving this review. How much does three or four packs of soy sauce cost them? I asked for for three extra packs of soy sauce and they placed one one the bag and stapled it up. I didn't notice the fooled me until I got home. The food is decent but taste like every other Chinese place. I may go back but I won't enjoy being made to feel bad when all I won't is extra soy sauce."}
{"text":"Glad to see yet another good Chinese fast food restaurant in Ahwatukee. Stopped by on our way home after shopping at Fry's grocery store. Didn't know what to expect but were very pleased with the two dishes we ordered. My wife's General Tso's Chicken was well done, crispy morsels of chicken and a well balanced sauce to boot. My Lo Main was equally good, laden with morsels of pork and shrimp. If I  were to be picky I'd say that I  would've loved the Lo Main to be a bit galickier. But I loved it overall. Good find!"}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times now and it's great service and delicious food that doesn't cost a fortune! It's very filling and I usually order enough to have leftovers. There's not a lot of seating but it's never been too busy where I wasn't able to sit down and eat. I definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"The egg drop soup was pretty good. I also got the mixed vegetables in garlic sauce. It was decent but I probably wouldn't order it again. Luckily I'm not vegetarian because I found chicken in the \"vegetarian dish\" lol"}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant recently when visiting the plaza they're in and decided to get lunch. Called in a lunch special order and egg roll, which came out just under $8. The food was ready when expected and was still warm when I got home. I thought the value was pretty decent - nice size portions of both the entree and rice, with a side of soup. The soup is slightly smaller than other takeout lunch specials I've done, but with as much food as they included in the entree package, I have no complaints. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been in Arizona since May and have tried five other Chinese food places and they were just ok or really bad. They first time I came I only ordered wonton soup and it was great, just like back home in California. Went back three days later with my family and ordered orange chicken, Mongolian beef, crab wontons, eggs drop soup and rice. We were so please to finally find amazing Chinese food. Great taste, portion and price. Writing this review we decide to come again, so here we are"}
{"text":"Happy to find Chinese food available in Ahwatukee on Christmas day as the unbelievably crowded Chinese restaurant we ordered from last year was not open. Language barrier over the phone so we drove over to find the place devoid of customers. They should have had someone twirling a sign on Chandler Boulevard the day prior noting that they would be open on Christmas Day. Our carryout was prepared fresh and the rest of the family enjoyed their food, while I enjoyed my egg roll as I thought the food had a somewhat unpleasant smell. Another reviewer mentioned a fishy smell. Will definitely try this place again though. Update: writing the review today made me crave egg rolls, sent husband to pick up two and they were delicious!"}
{"text":"ok going straight to the review. I ordered chicken and  Broccoli and  sesame chicken. The sesame chicken was really undercooked and soggy. The chicken and broccoli was sour and the fortune cookie was  stale. I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone. On top of it all I left a tip for carry out. I also asked for Soi sauce she gave me one packet."}
{"text":"I would give negative 5 stars if I could. I have ordered from here before and the food was good but today was a different story. As a kid I enjoyed eating candy and chewing bubble gum but as an adult not so much. The food I ordered today, szechuan chicken, sweet and sour chicken, and chicken in garlic sauce, was as chewy as bubble gum and I'm not exaggerating. I'm convinced that Willy Wonka or Bazooka Joe prepared the food. It was ALL soggy and undercooked. My wife and I were disgusted and threw it all away along with the money we threw away paying for it! The small amount I ate ended up upsetting my stomach. I also have to mention that I ordered garlic shrimp for my son and he did like the flavor but I had to advise him to chew slowly to savor the flavor of the 3 pieces of shrimp they gave him. Yes, you read that right, only 3 pieces. Needless to say we were all still hungry and had to get something else. I only suggest eating here if you are on a weight loss plan because the nasty food and small portions will ruin your appetite. Fire the cook immediately!!!"}
{"text":"This place could be good if they didn't have kids taking your phone and walk in orders. They have screwed up my order many times because they put kids at the front and they really don't know what they're doing. Love the food but it's definitely not worth the headache."}
{"text":"Be careful when ordering here, they have a young child taking food orders over the phone. Ordered a dish with no peanuts due to allergy. Food arrived with peanuts and when I called to let them know the same child answered and argued with me about the order. Had them remake it and I went to pick it up at which point an adult, maybe the manager, argued with me over the order and the child did as well. Be careful as they don't take any ownership of their mix ups and are very rude. I have been order of from them for a few months and this is what you get as a customer."}
{"text":"Came across this place that was open late on a Sunday night after Lights of the World by Rawhide. It was a nice surprise that the food prices was very reasonable and the flavors of what we ordered was very good. Walnut shrimp was a nice sized prawn. Crunchy outside texture. The portion of the black bean chicken was great and with very good flavor. The beef chow fun had enough flavor that only needed some chili oil (must ask for it as only shiracha is on the tables). Sweet and sour pork was very big portion as well. But not the best and not the worst. 

No chopsticks when asked (but I believe the Resturant is very new and was explained wasn't available just yet). We saw a man come in after we started to eat with a bag full of chopsticks. Eating area is little. Two tables seating four people and one table that sits two. Four bar stools are also available for seating. 

Overall I would recommend this Resturant in the simple fact that it stays open late (miss Chinatown in LA) which is rare for the Phoenix area and the food is pretty good w nice sized portions."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant a few weeks ago and got their Mu Shu,  broccoli beef, and and chicken with almonds.  The Mu shu tasted strange, the beef was soggy, and the dishes were not the best.  Last time we will go.  Still haven't found a great Chinese place that is good in the Ahwatukee area."}
{"text":"We had ordered orange chicken and dumplings. The orange chicken was okay, but the steamed dumplings' skin was a little to thick and doughy. I think that fried steamed dumplings would probably be a better choice than steamed dumplings if you plan on ordering dumplings here. The filling in the dumpling is made of beef and I think that it tasted pretty decent. In terms of size of this restaurant it is kinda small so I don't think it can hold big parties. The wait for the food was fairly fast."}
{"text":"If you enjoy canned meat, then this is the place for you. This was the lowest quality of food that I have eaten at a restaurant in a long time. The crisp vegetables in my Szechwan Chicken(canned) Was the most appetizing part. The egg roll was flavorless and the pork fried rice was very dry. I also had the House Special Lo Mein which was also less than satisfactory. However, you can't beat the price for the portions you receive."}
{"text":"I really think my rating should be about 4.5 but it's not an option. This Ahwatukee restaurant has been open about a month and I've gotten food here 3 times. 

I've had 3 different dishes and apps and all were very good. Well, except for one minor issue. I had the moo shu pork and the pancakes were hard and breaking up. However, the entree itself was excellent. 

There are only a few tables and a counter for sitting so I always took the food home. The food is prepared to order and is ready very quickly. 

Definitely recommended."}
