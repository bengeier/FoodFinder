{"text":"I like the fact that they're open 24 hrs but the atmosphere and decor is generally uninspiring. Seats were uncomfortable and table was wobbly. Also, one of the staff members (intentionally?) used spoiled almond milk in one of my drinks. Tasted horrible. They're reaction was nonchalant. Didn't even get the full refund since I ordered a cheaper drink instead. Pastry was mediocre. Buzzberry is just okay, and anyone who rates this four or more stars is delusional."}
{"text":"This place is AWFUL. It's disgusting inside and needs newer things rather than their beat down mismatching furniture. They promote untrue things and try to make the smoothies seem healthy when it's just puree in a bottle with a lot more not so healthy Ingredients in it. The iced tea is always sour and gross who knows how long they let it sit in those big containers. There is always a new girl at the window who has no idea what she's talking about. The service takes forever!! All in all I will NEVER be back to this dump of a place. Go to Starbucks or Jamba juice for the money you have to pay for the garbage here!!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Not to mention they somehow manage to always have cute girls working here... I use the drive thru mainly, I occasionally run into a line of cars there but it tends to move pretty fast. Nothing beats rolling in here before work and getting right up to the window quick. Everyone is friendly and I've found a few smoothie/add on combinations that I really like! 

Give this place a try.. You'll love it."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting and it's not because of the food. A coworker and I took one of our clients out to this buzzberry. the sandwiches were actually great but the owner or whatever she is \"skinny blonde\" is a despicable and miserable person. 

I don't think she realizes her voice carries and her patrons can hear every despicable thing she's saying from the dining room. Upon entering the restaurant I witnessed her verbally assaulting an employee from the side door of her restaurant.

 I couldn't believe our client had to be subjected to this. I worked as a barista in college for small coffee shop and just because people make a low wages doesn't mean that you can treat them any kind of way you want too. I live in the area and definitely won't be returning and will let my neighbors coworkers and clients I know that this place is horrible!


Very sad and disappointed!"}
{"text":"A great alternative to my usual Starbucks break & better coffee to boot! Doesn't look like much from the outside but it's really a neat place with friendly staff."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, it has so much potential. Great location, friendly staff, and the concept is spot on for the area. Unfortunately, the execution of this concept is very poor. The breakfast items I have tried all taste bland and microwaved, the eggs are gross, the ham is just thin pieces of sandwich meat, and the cheese is the orange sliced American I used to eat when I was a kid. The dinners I've had were a little better but unremarkable. It would be passably okay if the price reflected the low quality but it doesn't, it seems disproportionately expensive. I've never spent time inside the place because the decor is not inviting, it is unkempt and disheveled, I usually just take my food to go. The smoothies are probably the best thing they have but these, again, are unremarkable. Pastries are dry and bland, coffee is bitter or burnt tasting or the coffee has no flavor at all. This place needs a Chef who can make quirky stoner food with local fresh ingredients, local coffee, and maybe a beverage director to get a bar program going. It could be amazing. You can just tell that the owner either doesn't want to put any money into this business or has checked out. Or, maybe they don't know what they are doing. I live within walking distance to Buzz but my visits are sparse, I only go when I am out of options or have forgotten about the poor quality."}
{"text":"I have only been here a couple times. But so far this has been a really great place to go if you need something quick and easy. I love their smoothies and the environment of the place. It has a homey comforting feel to it. They also have really great deals. 
I would say definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"The serving size is a joke and the service is outrageous. I ordered a Chicken Caesar Salad through the drive-thru and was surprised by what I had received. 
Before ordering I had asked the clerk how big the salad would be and he demonstrated with his hands that it was pretty large ($8.75/$9.50a/t) I immediately went back to the clerk and showed him the salad (without opening the lid), and asked if this was the usual serving size of chicken, he insisted it was. 
I immediately parked and went inside and asked for a refund or exchange. He claimed that he could not except it because I had opened it, which I did not, and denied, and later claimed it was because I drove around with it, I drove around the building to park... I then stated that it was my first time and I did not expect to get this small of a portion of chicken for $9. He reinstated that it was the usual size and he could not do anything for me.
I am very upset with this service and have now resulted to Yelp to share my experience, and regret not checking Yelp beforehand to see how BuzzBerry treats their guests. 
The salad was decent, not far off from one I could have gotten from McDonalds across the street for way less,  and also could have received a larger portion of poultry."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and horrible customer service. Coffee drinks are average at best. Was hoping for much more since I live two blocks away. Is worth my time and money to hit up starbucks ."}
{"text":"Great place, minutes from home. Staff are friendly & courteous. Breakfast Bagels are great w/ a hefty serving of eggs on your sandwich. Egg Bacon & Cheese is my fave right now. You can walk in for the self serve coffee station plus the drive thru is convenient which i use most of the time before heading to work. If you're near the area give this place a shot & I'm sure you'll find what suits your taste buds."}
{"text":"First time to this place.  Have driven past it hundreds of times and always wondered if it was any good.  Well my kids were jonesing for a smoothie and we were right down the street so I figured we would give a local business a shot at our ridiculous smoothie obsession.  Upon walking in it was obvious that they were going for the \"Central Perk\" vibe...it was homey but cool.  That's about all I can say in a positive sense.  The place was way under staffed and those who were working seemed overwhelmed and disorganized.  We place our orders for three regular sized (medium) smoothies which were advertised to be made with nothing but fresh fruit.  We were all anticipating a great drink.  After waiting about 15 minutes for our drinks (which seemed to be the norm for all customers) we were extremely underwhelmed by what we received.  They were definitely not using fresh fruit; it must have been some kind of concentrate as there was no hint of any real fruit in the drink.  Second they added a ton of ice to the drink and didn't even blend it well enough to consume through a straw.  All three of our drinks were lousy...I didn't finish mine.  The people working there seemed very nice but did not deliver a good product in a reasonable amount of time.  Three medium smoothies were $20.  I may have hit these guys on an off day but will be sticking to Jamba Juice in the future."}
{"text":"Questionably the rudest management I've ever experienced. Not one to leave poor yelp reviews, but I was disgusted after leaving this restaurant. $4 for a watered down, bitter cup of coffee and the staff was terrible. I wouldn't recommend this joke of an establishment to anyone."}
{"text":"What can I say- I love this place! We've been enjoying Buzzberry consistently for about 4 years. I come every morning for a super secret menu extra large blackberry iced tea. The breakfast burrito is great, great coffee. Recently we tried the pulled pork dinner, also good. Love supporting a local place in the neighborhood and especially a dog friendly one.  oh and Kate is awesome!"}
{"text":"Buzzberry may not be the best coffee joint out there but it does the trick and it never hurts to support local. The staff is generally friendly and pretty quick. If you like a large drink make sure you get the \"secret menu\" large."}
{"text":"Love love love Buzzberry's iced chais! They're such a treat during those 100+ degree afternoons. I've come here at crazy hours in the morning and late afternoons and I have had nothing but the best service. All the employees are fantastic and greet me with a smile and friendly hello!"}
{"text":"I really try to support local business so I have been to Buzz Berry at minimum seven times before writing this review. Simply put they are too expensive and their service is just too slow."}
{"text":"1st time here. Drive thru is quick and convenient. Ordered the Asian chicken salad and almond milk iced latte. Salad portion was a good size for the price. However the lattes are a bit pricey and I think there was something wrong with my drink. It didn't taste like coffee at all, I can't describe it. Like some savory drink mixed with almond milk and the contents clumped together when my drink sat... I may go back for the food but will skip the drinks."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I actually drove thru the drive thru and ordered, though I pass Buzzberry almost daily. The girl who took my order was very pleasant. My order was perfect (I got the berry berry blast w/soy protein). DELICIOUS! And filling. They have sandwiches and soup as among many other menu items.  GREAT EXPERIENCE!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. They have the best smoothies, They're food is extraordinary. And the people are the nicest you will ever meet. They are always smiling and are passionate about everything they do and have.

The inside of the store just has this wonderfully relaxed feel to it.... sofas, super comfy overstuffed chairs, fouton, and regular tables/chairs. This is just a super chill place. I always wish I could spend more time there.

On top of that, their prices are amazing. Everything is SOOOO much cheaper than you would find at any other coffee house. And, they have way more than any coffee house could offer.... smoothies (the best I have yet to find in the Phoenix area), daily fresh baked goods, sandwiches, daily dinner selection, beer, wine... the list goes on and on!

They used to just have the drive-thru open 24 hours. But, now, the store is open 24 hours!!! Plus, all of their baked goods are half price after 9PM!! This is one place I think everyone has to experience at least once."}
{"text":"Love Buzzberry. Quick fix in the morning on your way to work whether you want caffeine or something fruity and cool. I don't think their prices are outrageous considering they use organic stuff, and when people say they could make something at home themselves, I always want to say okay, well, you didn't, and you're paying for the luxury of someone just handing you a delicious smoothie. I make my own smoothies all the time, but when I'm in a hurry and I want something good, I grab Buzzberry. The drive-through makes it super convenient too."}
{"text":"Sorry guys.... I've been a good customer for quite some time but things have gone downhill. 

Past experiences - 
The new (not so new anymore) points system for frequent customers never seems to be working, or the balance is way off, or the cashier didn't ask for my number and when I offered it was too late??

My Elvis used to be good....now it depends on who makes it - each employee seems to have their own idea of the ingredients? Some actually taste downright gross and I don't notice until I have drove away. I think one actually had some caramel flavor instead of mocha?

Today - I ordered a peanut butter and banana sandwich. When I got to my office, I discovered it also had strawberry jelly all over it and chips and pickle that come with it are missing. Not worth it for almost  $7.00.

Coworker got a peanut butter chocolate chunk cookie that tasted like it had freezer burn and the pickle with her sandwich made the entire bag soggy with pickle juice.

Please try to do better and I will consider coming back."}
{"text":"Guy at the counter was great and very friendly.  The fact that they are open 24 hours is awesome.  My qualm is the espresso shots were pre pulled in gallon containers.  Didn't taste right to me.  Don't know if there espresso machine is broken or what, but it could make a big difference in quality if those shots are pulled fresh."}
{"text":"Great little mom and pop shop! Really fair prices, good food, and a nice atmosphere with local art on the walls. I'm house sitting in the area and have been a few times this week for breakfast. The only thing I wish was different was that they used recyclable containers. Even when we dined in, we got styrofoam containers for our food."}
{"text":"We've only been here twice, but both times have been great! The coffee is wonderful, the smoothie was delicious, the banana bread was tasty, and my dog loves the buzzbones! 

My Little loves the kiddo corner, too. We'll definitely be returning customers as we are eager to try more items off the menu!"}
{"text":"I love that this place continues to work to improve. There is always a new experiment whenever I go--dog biscuits, dinner, omelets, etc. The oatmeal and nutty cocoa mocha are my favorite menu items! I wish I stilled lived close enough to go every weekend like I used to."}
{"text":"I have only had their coffee but it's pretty good and the employees at the drive-thru window are always super friendly.  We go before visiting the dog park and they always have a delicious treat and a friendly word for my pup.  She looks forward to it as much as I do!  Honestly, the friendly service and convenient location are what keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I come into buzzberry several times weekly and have yet to have a bad experience. 

The atmosphere: I love coming into buzzberry because it is kind of an off-beat place. There is artwork from locals for sale on the walls, random books to read, and you can even bring in your own coffee mug to leave on site. Also, the staff members there always greet you with a smile. 

The food: The breakfast wraps are pretty good, although I wish they had more varieties for cheese in their breakfast wrap. The cinnamon scone is my favorite, and its even better toasted. Ive also had their tuna salad at lunch which was simple but delish. 

The drinks: Hellooooo good coffee. I like strong coffee, but often times strong coffee can come off bitter as well. Not so here. Strong and smooth! Also, their smoothies are fabulous...I go for the strawberry-acai smoothie every time. I have now refer to this smoothie as the Magic Strawberry Acai because I just feel so much better about life after having it. Another note: you can get a frequent drinker card where you buy 3 coffees or 3 smoothies and get the next one free! Perfect :)."}
{"text":"Locally owned spot with a drive-thru and a wide variety of smoothies made with ORGANIC fruit (this is awesome), coffees, freshly baked pastries, etc. I found this place on Yelp while searching for something to appease my picky girlfriend and it's so close to us that I was surprised we never stopped by or noticed it before. 

I've only been twice now, but they are really nice and we enjoyed the nutty coco mocha and the $1 off with Yelp check-in so we came back today.

This place kind of reminds me of d'lish but with less food options. I got the sliders today and have to say they weren't the best, but I'll be back to try other stuff. The scones/muffins taste homemade and were still warm. 

I would love to see more food items on the menu and more of it visible on the side/menu of the drive-thru.

They told me to come back on a Sunday AM for some omlettes inside and I noticed on the side of the window they offer free coffee from 5AM-7AM, is this real life...?"}
{"text":"This place is pretty great.  I live just down the road and can walk here if I'd like.  I love the gigantic breakfast burritos you can get, and for a pretty reasonable price!  The also have a little beer & wine bar with three or four stools you can sit at.  

Great community atmosphere, there's a cork board with all kinds of local advertisements, everything from accountants, to dog walkers.  Lots of couches and places to comfortably sip a cup of coffee or eat a sandwich. 

The only reason I didn't give it five stars, is that there aren't really any TVs in the place.  Some may like the less electronic-heavy atmosphere, but I would love to kick back and watch a game sometime."}
{"text":"OK I have been coming here for years, and they have some of the best Smoothies in the area.  I have them make my favorite which is a change from their Four Berry Blast, have them substitute Pineapple Juice for the Orange Juice, man it is fantastic.  I wish I lived or worked closer, I have been known to hop off the 101 for a quick Smoothie on the way back to the office..."}
{"text":"Tolerable smoothies. Horrible, rude employees. Decent customer service is just as important, if not more, than the food or product purchased... Especially when there are hundreds of other places in the valley to choose from. Good luck."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their dairy free smoothies, although they are a tad expensive. Also having a drive thru is a plus when you are feeling lazy!"}
{"text":"I love having a locally owned joint to visit for coffee and smoothies but I really love that they have great staff. A special shout out to Crystal - she is such a nice person and made me smile. Thanks Crystal!!!!"}
{"text":"Buzzberry is an adorable neighborhood cafe with a wide array of menu items for all! I only wish it was closer to my house! Coffees, teas, all-fruit smoothies (I had the tropical escape and it was scrumptious!), breakfast, lunch and a nightly dinner specials....ooh AND beer/wine, drive-thru and 24 hr service. 

Quite frankly, I don't know how they do it all!! (All-natural dog treats, too!)

Though I only had the smoothie, I will absolutely go back to check out their vast offerings. Service was fast and friendly. Free Wi-Fi was easy to connect. Great study/meeting place or neighborhood hangout!"}
{"text":"I REALLY want to like this place - it's a local mom&pop coffee shop/ restaurant and in my neighborhood- that alone is enough to get my business. However, it just falls short on too many levels. The naked bars are great, but other than that the sandwiches are lacking (could be made at home) and for what they are, they're overpriced. The smoothies sound good, but taste more artificial than fresh. Sometimes the ice tea seems like it's sat too long.... I periodically go back so maybe I'll get to edit the review with good news!"}
{"text":"I love the smoothies at Buzzberry. However, they are a bit overpriced. If the fruit ingredients were organic, then I would understand. The people that work there are always very patient and kind."}
{"text":"Cash-money smoothie!!! I get the Nebraska w/ yogurt, peanut butter, and flaxseed every day."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time last weekend.  I had the roast beef sandwich.  It was nice to have a drive thru with healthy choices.
The portions were nice and the taste fresh.
I can't wait to return and try some other options."}
{"text":"I give Buzzberry's four stars for the environment and food.  This is a great place to grab breakfast and coffee with a friend or two and lounge around.  The interior is very comfortable and homey with armchairs and eclectic home items scattered around.

However, I would have to take away some points for their inconsistency.  My first egg and sausage wrap was freshly made and delightful, but my second wrap was clearly sitting around for a while, and the tortilla began to smoosh into the eggs."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed going here for years. The welcoming warm  spirit starts with the owner and runs through the staff. The quality has  always been excellent and they just keep adding more.  So overall a place of quality, service and connection for me."}
{"text":"Ordered a breakfast burrito.  Got it with bacon and asked what my options for veggies.  Spinach, mushroom, and tomato- got all 3., cheese, and scrambled egg.  Side of salsa on the side.  The burrito is an average size.  The burrito was not greasy at all! I hate greasy burritos. Very much like made at home with love.  I also tried some of the Carmel apple muffin- delicious. Boyfriend got the ultimate breakfast sandwich on a biscuit.  He said it was good.  Normally comes on a pretzel bun.  Biscuit broke easily when he ate it."}
{"text":"Great food and nice people.... This place is super healthy, just expensive for my protein shakes."}
{"text":"Love this local coffee shop. Set up is really nice. I always manage to get in and out very quickly whether it be walk in or drive through. Never experienced any problems with the staff, everyone is genuinely nice, even when it is super early in the morning. I'm a huge fan of the iced mocha, but annoyed with all the frequent price changes. Right now Starbucks has them beat. I will continue to go to Buzzberry being they are a local shop and has a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I feel so lucky to live in walking distance from Buzzberry Coffee and Smoothie shop! I go to Buzzberry everyday to get my large nonfat latte and I LOVE it! They actually have their own blend of espresso that is specially made for them, I am so hooked. The people who work at Buzzberry are always friendly. I give em 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"They give out free coffee every Monday from 5:00 - 7:00 a.m. which is great.  The coffee is very good, the only other food i've had is the breakfast burrito which was tasty.  The service is quick and they are always friendly."}
{"text":"Best service and super friendly staff.  Breakfast sandwiches are made to order on homemade biscuits, pretzel rolls and Hawaiian rolls. Loved their coffee and I'm a Starbucks fan!
They even have a drive thru order window."}
{"text":"I love coming here to work. It's quiet, laid back and the people who work here are always incredibly nice. The food is pretty good too. :)"}
{"text":"It's not the fact they sold me their last batch of cookies.... more so... the fact they tried to pull wool over my eyes by only frosting the two visibly seen cookies on the outsides... ONLY TO FIND OUT THE REST WEREN'T. I can't BELIEVE you actually charged us for these? This is a moral problem... and quite frankly.. I'm curious as to what else they're hiding.......... Left with 2 regular sized smoothies and some cookies that averaged out to 20 bucks... never coming back. 
p.s. I never post reviews, but this actually made me mad."}
{"text":"*7/29 Update - I don't even know where to begin with how amazingly awkward it has been speaking with Molly on this. Now I see this nonsense about slander when just yesterday she sent me a message that stated \"Tips are typed in manually.  No one is stealing, it was simply a typo.\" Totally fine if it was a mistake, doesn't mean I wasn't overcharged and have yet to receive a refund. Not a surprise to see it though as only 2 days ago I was told \"Denying a charge for products received is theft; per your bank card.\" Also I looked into some employee complaints about the resturant which said they never got a fair share of the credit card tips. Management was keeping it and claiming it was going to management fees.
https://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/33jfrx/buzzberry_and_bistro_scottsdale_not_great_to/  

So now I'm curious as to who benefited from the extra $2.38 that was tacked onto my bill. I guess the best advice I could give anyone is if you go to Buzzberry, pay with cash, tip with cash. I'd also say if you have a bought things from them in the passed with a credit card double check to see if you were charged properly. 

---Original Post----
Overcharged my credit card, probably someone tacking on an extra tip for themselves (I included a tip already). I called to report and get it corrected, they took my information down and then never called back. I get that its only $2 but if you have no concern to protect consumers $$ then I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"My wife and I used to love Buzzberry and we were willing to overlook inconsistencies in the amount of food given and the time it takes to make it. One day we just got fed up with it when they forgot about me  on the side of the building where I was supposed to receive my food. I waited 15 minutes for a breakfast burrito that never came so I drove back around inquiring about it. No one knew what happened and someone said it already went out. A few minutes later they \"found it\" and it was a joke of a burrito. Fraction of the size I'm used to getting. They even forgot the salsa. I came home and it was cold and slapped together as if a first grader had done it. I called to complain and told them that I'm not satisfied with this service and I was offered a call back from the owner. It has been over a month now and no contact whatsoever. 

This is not how you treat loyal customers that came back nearly every day. We're not asking for much just a little consistency and curtesy when there is a problem."}
{"text":"went through the drive-thru yesterday for a latte and I wasn't expecting much but probably had one of the best lattes I had ever had.  

I order a simple latte with carmel drizzle and 2 splenda and sometimes coffee shops make perfectly and sometimes not so perfectly....but buzzberry got it.  
can't wait to go bac and check out the inside.  the pricing is similar to starbucks but at least it's local :)"}
{"text":"Buzzberry is a cute place, good coffee, nice staff.

The only complaint is that I order the same drink eveytime and have been charged a wide variety of prices ranging from 4-7 dollars for the same drink lol.

I'll continue to come back, but maybe inform some of the newer staff about pricing.

Other than that keep up the good work Buzzberry !"}
{"text":"I'm going to update my review to 4 stars because the management is fantastic and really cares about their customers.  We will definitely be back.

Most of my issues I think have come down to growing pains as they're getting busier and the newly hired employees haven't taken the same attitude to heart yet.

I would still like the lights dimmed a bit for dinnertime for atmosphere and ambiance, but it's a fun place to relax for a weekday dinner."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Only one person to work counter and drive-through while 2 stood in the kitchen.  Waited a ridiculous amount of time to be acknowledged and even longer to be waited on.  She walked away between me ordering and the other person with me and we had to wait even longer to get the 2nd half of the order done.  Employee was slamming cups down, rolling her eyes and heavily sighing when taking the order.  It was only 3 of us and 2 of us order the cinnamon roll...all she had to do was get it out of the case.  I ordered the breakfast burrito.  It was cold by the time she got around to giving it to me.  She said that it is standard that they are short staffed, that is how it is run.  So, if that is the case - then leave the attitude, as this is your \"normal\".  She did discount the price because she didn't helps us as soon as we should have been.  So that was about the only thing good."}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere, fun place to do work with the free internet. Their burritos are excellent along with the coffee.  A little pricey, but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Ordered one panini minus the onions. Pretty simple order.  Took 20 minutes to make.  Panini had onions on it.  The cheese wasn't even melted and no pickle spear.  First and last visit, I couldn't even finish the $10 school lunch sandwich."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood coffee shop.  Friendly staff and good food and coffee.  Nice place to eat and relax or get something to go.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and got the sliders and a smoothie. The bread was stale and there was SO much bread....hardly any meat and no cheese. Very dry and bland and I ended up tossing it out. The smoothie was watered down and had zero flavor. Not impressed for the $14.00. The girl working there was VERY nice though...the food/drink just needs some work."}
{"text":"Elvis, Elvis all day long! It's a nice, icy blend of peanut butter, banana, whey protein and mocha. It's a little pricey (around $7), but I typically drink half of it and save the rest for the next morning. The caffeine content is high enough to do the job even if you don't drink it all in one sitting. They also have a rewards card, buy 5 get the 6th free. So the higher price is offset if you stop by on the reg. 

Sunday's they have an awesome omelet bar, made to order. They have a wide variety of meats and veggies you can choose from. And it's served with some delish fresh salsa and cheesy potatoes. Order an ice cold mimosa and you'll be set!"}
{"text":"They have a $1 off Yelp check-in offer...which makes this place almost reasonably priced. (I use Starbucks as my rip-off barometer.)  

I got a dirty chai (extra $.50 for the espresso shot - pretty standard) and it was good...but there was some sort of looming after taste that I couldn't figure out.  Maybe it's the specific type of beans (roasted locally if memory serves me correctly) or a different chai mixture.  I never could place it, and I did finish my drink...

Drive-through is simply order AND wait at the window, so expect to invest a bit of time getting your drink. Luckily on my single visit, the person ahead of me only ordered drinks - I would be interested to see how long food takes to prepare with this sort of drive-through style.

Will I be back?  Not likely, but it isn't because buzzberry is outrageously priced or their drinks poor. Rather, to me, it was fairly unremarkable AND a bit out of my way."}
{"text":"Why I like it:
*The Americano, coffee, and various hot lattes rawk.
*The beans used in the coffee and espresso don't taste burnt like chain coffee-huts.
*It's always clean and has a very cozy and laid back atmosphere.
*The pastries rawk.
*The five plus times I've been there, the staff has always been helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"I come here regularly because it's close to my house. Their croissant breakfast sandwich is the best ever, but they've been all out of croissants the past few times I've tried to get it. The staff is super friendly, but also they seem sort of under staffed and/or under managed. Overall I like this place."}
{"text":"I have been a customer of Buzzberry for a couple years.  I loved this place once.

I'm very irritated with them.  I loved the concept, and I love that they are dog friendly, but the place is depressing and dark inside.  The walls are painted a weird green and the furniture is horrible.

I'm irritated the food, it's never consistent.  The raw bar has been changed three times.  I used to love the moist raw bar a year ago, they changed it by adding oatmeal, making it dry, now, they took out the dark chocolate they once had in it.  I'm pissed.  I just spent over $4.00 on a pathetic raw bar that has NO flavor.  

It's also unusual to me that Buzzberry doesn't sell Coke or Pepsi products, not even in  a can.  It seems to me that it would be a wise investment for them to have a soda fountain since the markup is so high on soda -- and again, not even cans or bottles of 
Coke or Pepsi products.  I'm done with this place and their expensive food

Grrrrrrrrrr, Buzzberry."}
{"text":"Started coming here because it's open 24 hours, and the place I was trying to go in the same parking lot had already closed for the night. Turns out it's fantastic! The smoothies are really tasty, and so is the food. The girls behind the counter are really nice, too. Only thing is that the prices are a little high, but it's a great place for the occasional splurge."}
{"text":"Neighborhood gem! Love the all fruit smoothies and quick breakfast if you are on the go. Got an iced chai that was decent... Kind of grainy texture which is why I'm giving it a 4. But super friendly staff! Really want to try one of their daily dinners soon!"}
{"text":"Great place! Very friendly staff and very reasonable prices on the drinks. It's a bit out of my way, but I know where I'm going next time I go to the Chaparral Dog Park!"}
{"text":"Have you tried the \"BUZZ BERRY CHAI\"? By far the BEST drink here.  Love having this local gem close by and the addition of the drive thru makes it perfect!"}
{"text":"What a joke, I really wish I had read the reviews before I stopped here but I was traveling I was hungry and I needed a shot of espresso. I'm the only one in here 20-minute wait for a turkey sandwich with 2 oz of meat on it and then the girl never brings my coffee out takes her hair down wanders around tells me she's off duty and leaves. I asked for mustard on my sandwich I got nothing on it. Half a slice of avocado for an extra dollar. When a sandwich is supposed to come with spinach on it three little leaves on the whole sandwiches not spinach on my sandwich it's a joke. This place is probably great with high school kids. Then I asked the other girl for my coffee and she goes answers for customers at the window before she makes mine another 10 minutes of my life wasted. At least the girl that finally did help me was very nice and pulled a really good shot of espresso I was impressed."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place I might frequent as a local, but not really \"think\" too much about - a casual place to grab a bite and sink into a couch with your computer or one of many magazines and local indie papers scattered about the lounge-y area. I'd imagine it's a good place to get work done day or night since they transition from coffee into several solid beers and a few basic wines and cocktails come evening time. 

The sandwiches, coffee, smoothies and baked goods were solid - relatively fresh and straightforward, addresses basic cravings but don't surprise you. There's a good range of options of all of the above, enough to cover your bases for those days when you just want an easy breakfast or lunch without pretense. Side note: they make their own almond milk (definitely tasted the grit in my almond milk latte, but I appreciate the homemade factor)."}
{"text":"Buzzberry is the best locally owned coffee shop in the area! I started going last year as a student at SCC for mid-morning snacks and smoothies, and now that I'm a novice coffee drinker I can't get enough of their brews. This morning I had the pleasure of trying the red velvety latte, one of their seasonal drinks. 5 stars! It literally tastes like a liquified red velvet cupcake with caffeine. I've been there probably a dozen times and am always greeted warmly and have fantastic speedy service. I definitely recommend visiting Buzzberry if you're in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here so that we could do some homework and study. We ended up getting breakfast burritos. While the food is great, I wasn't too pleased when I looked to my right and saw cockroaches running on the floor. Not sure if this is a problem or they just so happened to walk in after us."}
{"text":"Never disappointed here. Bagel with bacon is the go to. Try the yogurt cup or if you're extremely hungry go after the monster burrito. You won't be wanting food for the rest of the day. Possibly the rest of the week."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a late night date! My boyfriend took me here tonight I got a delicious smoothy with cherries, pineapple,  low fat yogurt and superfoods. I also tried the homemade Hawaiian roll which was very good. The place reminded me of a coffee  café in nyc. 
They sell a little bit of everything. You can sit and chat with your partner or friends any time of night because it's 24 hrs. Its a great place to go. It definitely BEATS Starbucks!  Starbucks is boring compared to this place. They offer a whole lot more."}
{"text":"Some of their drinks are pretty good (Scottsdale sunrise is my personal favorite) however, I do find them to be fairly overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Buzzberry is a truly unique spot. I'm honestly surprised I haven't visited this place sooner. I've driven past it a number of times without ever even noticing its existence. I found out about it through a coworker who knows I love good coffee.

I made the mistake of eating before I came. Turns out, Buzzberry has a pretty large and diverse menu including everything from coffee to smoothies to juices to baked goods to burritos and even delicious looking omelets!

The omelets are made in front of you at their cool little corner omelet station and you have full control over what goes in it. Just pick and choose your ingredients from the menu, wait a few minutes while they whip it together, then enjoy!

The real draw to this place, in my opinion, is the setting. Tons of large comfy furniture, plenty of group seating, plenty of outdoor seating, even a game area! Buzzberry is spacious yet cozy. I would consider it an easy choice for working, too.

I ordered the Martian Juice first because I needed my power nutrients. It was very heavy on the celery, which is not my preference for flavor, but not bad overall. I don't know that I'd order it again...  I then ordered a coffee and it was just ok, too.

Regardless of my thoughts on the juice and coffee, I would definitely come back to try out the omelets. They talk a lot about them here. You can tell they take pride in their food, so I'll have to come back to experience that soon.

They also serve beer, wine, Bloody Mary's, and mimosas here. That's pretty cool, too. It really does seem to be a one-stop-shop. Service was great and everything came fast. If you haven't been and you live nearby, give it a whirl!"}
{"text":"The muffins are really amazing! The coffee is mostly good these days, though a few times it has been bad (old coffee taste in the afternoons). I still keep coming back and hope their coffee will get more consistent as I drink it black and don't mask the flavor with creamer.  Maybe 1 out of 10 coffees is not so good...so those odds aren't that bad...even other shops get it off on some days as do I for that matter at home!  Super friendly staff, and good chili! Great little patio."}
{"text":"This place is close by, friendly, speedy and generally delicious! I always come here for smoothies because it's less expensive than nektar and has a drive through. The reason this place does not get 5 stars is because of the set up of the drive thru. The patio ruins the straight line drive from the ordering box to the window. I have probably nicked my rims 2-3 times from driving through this drive thru that I no longer use the drive thru and get out and order inside. I've brought it up to the kind gentleman  at the window and he said \"funny, I've never heard someone say that.\" Hmmm. 


My favorite drink is the worlds best smoothie with peanut butter!"}
{"text":"I had an interesting experience here yesterday. I ordered an Americano and the lady operating the espresso machine (I can't call her a barista as it was obvious she's had no training) didn't tamp the espresso. I asked, and she said \"we don't do that\", which I found odd. I mean, isn't that just coffee if you don't tamp the espresso? Now I was only a barista for 2 years in college, so I'm no expert, so I asked facebook. Here were the responses:
\"If you don't tamp you're making drip coffee...\"
\"Espresso is made by forcing very hot water under high pressure through finely ground, compacted coffee. Tamping down the coffee promotes the water's even penetration of the grounds.\"
\"Your espresso should be tamped;-)!\"
\"If you're gonna make it without tamping go ahead and call it expresso...because it's faster and you clearly don't know what you're doing.\"
My conclusion was that espresso should be tamped so I'll be driving out of my way to Echo coffee until the folks at Buzzberry learn to tamp their espresso.

*I gave an extra star because their cinnamon roll is really good, but I don't know if they actually make them or purchase them.*"}
{"text":"Visiting friends in Scottsdale and they recommended buzzberry. I arrived at 6 am at the same time as the girl at the front counter and we were both still half asleep. However she was on the ball with suggesting the new pretzel bun for their breakfast sandwich. I chose chorizo as my meat for what she thought was an interesting combo--but OH was it delicious. Paired with a silky smooth Café au Lait and I was ready to tackle a full day of work and then drive to San Diego. 

Having worked at a 24 hr coffeeshop for 3 years, finding another that could steal my heart has always been hard--but I have found that in buzzberry. What's more, is they have converted it from an old service station which I adore being a frequenter of Cocoa Cinnamon in Durham, NC--a coffeeshop which has adopted the same concept. Reclaiming dilapidated properties and making them into something beautiful and cozy like this is so encouraging and inspiring! If for no other reason, you should patronize buzzberry because of the welcoming atmosphere and their commitment to the community.

I full-heartedly give them 5 shining stars and wish them nothing but success as they continue to keep the buzz going."}
{"text":"I SO want to love this place.  Not want-ed.  Want.  But so far, I don't. There are some great things - the people are super friendly, seem genuinely happy to be there, and the place is very cool. I like the giant chess set, the kids corner, the couches, mismatched furniture, etc.  There are a lot of cool spaces to park without feeling like you are in someone else's space or conversation.  But some very important things are. . . well, not so hot.  The coffee is not good.  I ordered two lattes the last time I was in there.  The milk was a little more than warm, and just failed in general.  The taste. . . blech.  I ordered a lemon poppyseed muffin.  I should have known when all the front muffins were carefully wrapped in plastic.  (Plastic wrap = not enough movement.)  The muffin was dried out, overly dense, and maybe had tasted okay before it hit the freezer and then the muffin case - last week.   I wasn't too impressed with the smoothie either. I ordered a blueberry banana for the kids to share, and while it may have less calories than your average smoothie, the kids said, \"It wasn't bad.\" My niece said she preferred Jamba Juice, my daughter said she preferred my husband's.

I think if this place is going to make it, they are going to have to WAY step it up on the drinks and food.  Or at least take down the sign touting fresh muffins. . . But I am hoping they can pull it together!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I don't know what all the \"buzz quote is about. See what I did there? Ha ha I went there for my first time and I got a cookie and a smoothie. I waited 15 minutes for one smoothie.... when I finally got it I was excited because I thought if it took that long it must be really good. However, it only teeth like frozen blueberries and ice. I could do that at home myself so I don't see the point in buying something like that this drink was supposed to have four different kinds of berries in it which I assume that means BlackBerrys, raspberries, blueberries and whatever else with the Banana the girl the front told me there was a whole banana in it. Don't taste it. I actually don't taste anything other than frozen blueberries and ice. I probably wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"My review may be totally biased as I've only come here a few times and ordered the same thing each time lol. 

I normally get their \"worlds best\" strawberry banana smoothie. It's pretty good in my opinion and they always make it very fast. I've ordered their pulled pork sand which before which was really good. I'll update as I order different items."}
{"text":"Okay so I work down the street from buzzberry and was very interested in this place before it open the name along sounded unique. Went there shortly after it had opened and bought a chai tea it wasn't what I had expected but in a good way gave it a three out of five."}
{"text":"I still love this cute, quaint place, but the prices have just gotten too high for my liking.  My regular smoothie now costs almost $7.00 ($6.91 to be precise).  That is just too much!  I still love the customer service here, they are always very friendly and know me and my dog by name.  I just feel like I need to be honest.  Even with the buy 5 get one free, the prices have just become too high.  Now, I only come here when I am meeting a friend for a coffee/smoothie because the place is cute with a cozy atmosphere, but I am no longer a 'regular'."}
{"text":"I stop by here for Iced Coffees all the time.  The IC's are cold brewed, but they do taste a little Toddy-ish so that you have to cut the flavor with some milk or cream.  I like the use of space and the overall small business vibe.  They sell breakfast burritos and have yet to try them out, but the sandwiches and bagels are pretty good."}
{"text":"Drive by this place every day...thought I would stop in and order an iced tea. How could anyone mess up an iced tea? The gentleman behind the drive thru was super nice and I appreciated his enthusiasm. However, the iced tea was way over exaggerated as to how good it was. It truly tasted as if the tea had been fermenting in an old carafe for a week. It tasted horrid, like a musty mildewy flavor. I unfortunately took that one and only sip and that was it...down the drain it went along with my $4.18. So overpriced!! Unfortunately that is enough to keep me from ever stopping in again. If you can't refresh your tea carafes, how can you provide fresh veggies and fruits and smoothies? Too bad. Back to AJs I go for amazingly yummy tea for $1.50 for a large!!!"}
{"text":"After just a couple visits, I must say \"This IS just about as good as it gets\"!

Driven by many times. Finally stopped for goodies to take home to a sick wife.... The place is SPOTLESS... the customer service and overall attitude is amazing and the breakfast sandwiches, coffee drinks and fresh baked (in-house) goodies are GREAT!

I love locally owned successes!
Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I used to go all the time when I lived on the side of town. Every time I'm in the area I try to stop by. They're delicious! Their omelets, sandwiches, and teas are my favorites. I do have to say, I love to treat myself to their treats, especially at night when they go on sale :) 

Good for working, studying, relaxing."}
{"text":"The fall coffee collection is great and I love the Pumpkin Latte! 
Sometimes the coffee is missing a little more creamer then I order but otherwise I love the sandwiches and coffees. 
A quaint place to meet."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this gem while traveling in Arizona. We stopped for a quick breakfast sandwich and were pleasantly surprised! It's an adorable little coffee shop with great food and impeccable service! They even have a little bar for libations later in the day. Great stop!"}
{"text":"Was here a long time ago and was in the neighborhood decided to swing by and support local! Was there at noon and they were out of skim milk? They are literally two feet from a super market and had multiple employees working why couldn't one person go get milk? Seems like a silly thing to complain about but when your spending $6 on a drink you'd want it the way you like it, they didn't even have 2% only regular milk? Also place looked a little run down.  Not to mention the barista poured a pre mixed concoction in my drink didn't even make it  with fresh espresso shot? Overall very odd experience.  Wouldn't go back, not for the price."}
{"text":"Cozy little coffee house. They have a wonderful Sunday brunch also. Great meeting place with friends and family. Beats Starbucks any day! Best Iced Tea hands down..anywhere! The green tea is the same you get at the Camelback Inn Spa! Ask for the frequent drink card! Drive thru gets a little busy in the morning but worth the wait. Their drive thru is open 24/7 !!! Love this in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"We read reviews about the place having a \"dingy atmosphere\" but ignored it because we actually like little hole-in-the-wall places. But this was just something different. 

They had a million things on the menu and it was SO overpriced. Like.... almost jokingly overpriced. So I just got a drip coffee and went to focus on the work I came here to do. The coffee was actually good. No complaints about that!

My bf and I decide to sit at the bar, but moved shortly after because there was a cheap little bluetooth speaker next to us that was annoyingly loud. I guess they thought it would actually sound good as a sound system for the whole shop and hoped nobody would sit next to it? Not sure. 

Everything looked cheap and the whole setup just didn't work. Gave 2 stars instead of 1 because I think this place would be okay if you were to just run in, grab a coffee, and leave."}
{"text":"Decent food. I have had a few of their sandwiches and they are all good and their chocolate chunk muffin is to die for. They don't always get my order correct when I have something taken out of a sandwich or added in which is why it gets 4 stars and not 5. Coffee is good!"}
{"text":"You are not allowed on the property anymore. If you force the issue, I will contact the police and have you cited for trespassing. Yes. I can do that. Ask the Scottsdale Police. 

Again. Move on.


What a bitter woman. Banned because I gave her crappy food and drink an equally crappy review. I'm moving on to a deluxe apartment in the skyyy."}
{"text":"This place does a great job. The staff is always friendly and offer A+ service. The food is consistently good and fresh. They do omelets every Sunday morning. The iced tea is always on point. *ask for the Elvis* ;).
They promote local fundraising by letting various groups do car washes over the weekends. Great place to stop on the way to work for fresh fruit and a coffee. You have to stop in and try the pretzel b's and a pint of beer. If you have time go in and sit down and play a game of chess or browse on your laptop and enjoy a glass of vino. A great way to support local shops! Only reason for 4 stars are the prices. They use fresh ingredients but I wouldn't expect the price to be as high."}
{"text":"Once again I went on my Scottsdale smoothie mission, today I stumbled upon the lovely buzz berry. Not only did they customise and perfect my order, they did it with a smile on their face and stimulating conversation. I would come back any morning, as I am curious about their breakfast burrito and bottomless mimosas."}
{"text":"Coffee is good, but the wifi is a Sprint Mifi.  I'm here now, and my speedtest results are awful.  I can't work from here, and my home internet is down.  They need to upgrade the wifi and I'll return.  Until then, I can't work from here, which defeats the purpose.

{"text":"Obsessed with their all fruit smoothies which you can customize to your liking. I usually get something like a mango, strawberry & peach. The $1 off on yelp is a major bonus too!!  I crave their smoothies big time, their baked good always look fantastic.  Living in Gilbert area, I definitely go out of my way to visit this shop. The ladies at the counter provide excellent device as well, always super helpful even when busy-did I mention that l LOVE LOVE THE SMOOTHIES!!! ...Would definitely try other menu options, but still hooked on the SMOOTHIES!!"}
{"text":"Way too expensive for a turkey sandwich I can make at home. It was around $7.75 for the sandwich and a bag of plain potato chips. Small smoothie was $4.75. Over priced."}
{"text":"This is a cute little spot to pick up a nice iced coffee, smoothie or a little baked good. I stopped in with my son had a lovely ice coffee with a friendly service to boot. I would definitely return to this place because the food looks really really good!

Not sure about some of the other reviews here but I had a good experience."}
{"text":"Well, I love this place, but it is because I am biased to the Staff, whom I think are wonderful!  They are helpful, and almost always smiling.  I LOVE that they bring me my order when it is ready!

I love that it is casual, more like you are at your best friends house than a coffee shop.

Love the smoothies, and thanks to my friend Brad, now LOVE the oatmeal.  I know, OATMEAL!  And the breakfast burritos have GOT to be totally fattening because they are totally awesome!  If you don't already know, you can get a big ol', kick-that-hangover's-ass omelet, made to order, with cheesy potatoes every Sunday for a steal!"}
{"text":"Makes me feel like I'm in Colorado or Oregon where my family is, very homie feeling!! And really nice staff!"}
{"text":"Great smoothies. Fast service, even a drive-thru ! Also sometimes my daughter wants an afternoon snack and they have sandwiches here also (even PB&J for the kids).
Smoothie card- buy 5 get 1 free!!"}
{"text":"I really, really tried to like this place but it's just not consistent. This morning was the straw that broke the camels back... Let me paint you a picture.

 It's 6 am, your two year old woke up hungry and, you'll never guess, demanding. Buzzberry is a quick option. You order oatmeal for the boy & soy latte for you, but make a point to have it CHILDS HOT. Both come out steaming like it was cooked in a crematory. After 5 minutes of blowing on it, you ask for ice. 6 ice cubes later you assume it's ok. Your little one tries it and all hell breaks lose; oatmeal spit everywhere, crying, screaming, trying to do everything to keep it from burning his tongue. (Keep in mind you did test it but underneath was still hot.) Frustrated, you ask for a bag and voice the fact nothing was what you specifically asked for... You get a blank look. Not we'll fix it or I'm sorry. So, your kids bent out of shape in tears & your $6 latte is watered down in ice with generic sugar... Awesome start of the day!

You only hope the look that you gave the guy who said \"have a good day\" as leaving will haunt him in his sleep. 

Now that being said, there are two pleasant girls that work drive-thru mid day. I appreciate their genuine hospitality. One is a younger brunette & a blonde (I really need to work on my name remembering skills) 

Don't recommend the shakes, go to one-stop nutrition
Do recommend the coffee cake or blueberry muffins. But sad to say I'll never be back."}
{"text":"This is an update. We visited Buzzberry about a week ago and the interior has changed again. Some changes for the better and other for the worse. The drywall was nice but it seems to have lost a lot of its quirky charm I loved so much. I know you can't please everyone but I miss the old buzzberry. 

The menu has gotten so big and a bit overwhelming. I only ordered a tea and fruit cup which were fine but I do miss the intimate cute setting it used to have."}
{"text":"The quality has gone down at this place, they don't use espresso anymore, you literally have to ask for hot espresso!!! Seriously??? When I asked the owner for hot espresso she shook her head, what a freakin cheap skate. Congratulations buzzberry! You've lost a loyal customer of two years!"}
{"text":"Roughly 9 dollars for a tuna sandwich.... These prices are hella reaching right now for the quality of food. The register clerk seemed out of it..."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a coffee and grabbed a small tea and 2 bottles of water and waited at the drive thru for close to 20mins!!! Seriously for 1 coffee and an ice tea, the viral weren't very friendly and were just like \"whatever\" while I waited and to top that all off coffee tasted nothing like a pumpkin spice at all!!! I'm a coffee fanatic and will be in that area once a week and will NOT be going back which stinks bc I would have made it a regular stop!"}
{"text":"Let's start off with saying this used to be my absolute favorite place to go. I used to stay there working in homework and eating delicious homemade treats and drinking good coffee and AMAZING smoothies in their comfy, home-like shop. Now, it's a dark and stiff place to go. The portions are half the size what they used to be. I found a medium black hair in my sandwich (I'm a long blonde haired person) and the staff Is suddenly very rude. I'm really upset. The place used to have a \"Friends\" vibe to it and that's so hard to find. I miss the giant chess set and the super nice employees. I also noticed they aren't open 24/7 now, which is sad because I live close and used to come by at all hours."}
{"text":"I buzzed into the drive-thru on Saturday morning to order a quick iced latte before heading out to the Polo Championships! To my surprise, a large iced skinny vanilla latte was over $6! I couldn't believe the price. It was good, but not great. It was a little watery and the flavor was off. Their drive-thru is convenient for folks on the go, but I was in line for about 7 minutes and I was only 1 car back. If you're in a hurry, I don't recommend the drive-thru. I will most likely stop at a different coffee shop when headed up north on the 101 next time!"}
{"text":"Family friendly coffee joint. I also love this place because they work closely with the local schools. Employees are always warm and attentive to your orders"}
{"text":"Really amazing place. Came here on the late night and the service was quick and the guy was super nice. They had a great selection of muffins and pastries to choose from. I'll definetly be back to try some other things."}
{"text":"This place was amazing they know my dog and they make their food with love and care and with all the special and local ingredients. Such a special place where you can go get work done on a laptop or get a smoothie with your kid. You can even take your dog after a long hot day and get them buzzbones, soooo good for your dog, I can see the raw carrots in them.! Chris knows how to make great drinks with their own infused liquors and Jessica makes you feel like youve been a regular all along! Such a great pleace, great service,  great treatment and recommendations, go there! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Buzzberry's chess set, book collection and switchable radio are all very dandy, but the food is simply \"alright\". It's really nothing special. The prices are just a bit too high to justify eating here unless you live a luxurious lifestyle. Sandwiches, pastries, bagels and smoothies are the common fare here and none of them are exceptional.

If you do come here, try ordering some of the breakfast items that are served in the morning. I always stick with a cinnamon raisin bagel and cream cheese. Yummy and slightly more affordable than the more fancy menu options."}
{"text":"I love this place! I stop by every week.  love there espresso, smoothies, and breaky burritos. Super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This is crazy to write because I use to love this place until today. The staff is always kind and provides the best service. I loved this place so much that I raved to my co-workers to check it out. However, my love for this place is gone and because of the owner. So, the have a asian chicken salad which is made of mixed greens, chicken, cabbage, red onions, mushrooms, carrots and asian noodles. However, I have alot of allergies, so my request is simple. I always order mixed greens, chicken, carrots and 2 eggs and that's it. I have been ordering this since I started until today. The order advised the staff that they could not modified the salad because it's hard to know what to charge. Really? I am ordering a salad that is 3 less ingredients than the original. So, I had to be charge instead of $9.39 but $11.67. Seriously? This is how you treat a customer that has been coming there for months and referring you to other people. I saw the owner talking to the employees and fussing at them and I felt bad. I cant believe just wanted a salad with 4 ingredients could cause so much trouble. In the end, they have lost a customer and I have told my entire office to not return because the owner doesn't know how to treat customers.  The staff at this place is amazing and wonderful. It's ashame that the owner would be the one with no customer service."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru this morning on our way to hike. Seems like a cool little place. Has a great menu selection.
We ordered the Worlds Best, a Fuzzy Buzzy, a lemon blueberry muffin and a bacon egg croissant and everything tasted fabulous! I will definitely be back to try the peninis too! 
My only complaint was that the drive thru wait was a little bit long! Otherwise I was very pleased!"}
{"text":"Wow, I never write Yelp reviews but this really made me mad. We ordered two brisket meals for $13 EACH and received three small pieces of brisket that were entirely fatty and chewy and the majority of the food was carrots and some mashed potatoes. Worst brisket I've ever had by far. Super disappointing. Thought they may have accidentally mixed it up and thought it was one order split since the portions of brisket were so small  but it was definitely two separate orders after calling and confirming. Don't go here. Will not return or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Nice local spot....the owners are doing everything they can to make a buck.
Little pricey----I don't mind paying if the items are worth it...they were close.
Wifi was strong.....counter girl was the best----really knew the products but, used non-specific words such as \"we get all our products from farmers markets within 30 miles\"...but, there were bottled juices, beers, other items that clearly are not 'local'....don't get me wrong--they are trying!

I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Edit after a lot of changes.  New hours change is understandable but disappointing. Quality of food/drink has decreased, at least from a consistency standpoint, as sometimes you get something great (like before) other days it's ok at best. My dog used to like to go for snacks but now they're gone too (unless trying to buy a pack). Just lost some of the vibe that made you want to go back.  Familiar faces that work there still great, and sure new people will catch up.  Still worth a visit, still better than a lot of the local options, but when you've know this place to be a 5* every visit it's disappointing when it's drops off a bit."}
{"text":"I've visited this cafe a few times. I always end up ordering some baked goods as they are always amazing. The atmosphere is nice and there is always friendly staff. Once I had a quality issue with an order and the manager went out of her way to make sure it was made right. Definitely a business who values their reputation and the customer. I'll be back.m again."}
{"text":"Free Coffee 5-7am on Monday's.

I like the vibe of this neighborhood joint.  Great tasting all fruit smoothies and the best part is, they have a drive thru.  It's perfect for a pick me up in the middle of the day when the last thing you want to do is get out of your car into the 113 degree heat, thank you again for the drive thru!!  

The lady that served me was very sweet and made a killer strawberry banana smoothie.  Next time, I intend on trying their breakfast or other food items listed on the menu."}
{"text":"Pancake was very helpful and sweet. This was my first time at buzzberry and won't be my last. The food is delicious! Also thank you to Brandon, the sandwich was perfect! 

 Thank you"}
{"text":"Frozen latte...exactly what you need in the summer heat! This place is so yummy and independent!"}
{"text":"Love having a spot like this in our neighborhood.  Coffee, smoothies and food are all good...and I love the decor.  Another plus, they added a drive thru window!

They also support the local schools and pet organizations which makes me want to patronize them all the more!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. The fruit wasn't ripe and for the price it should have had flavor."}
{"text":"I would describe the food and coffee at Buzzberry as.... delicious!  The building is bursting with 90's style charm. I have always had very friendly service, even back when I used to come around on my rollerblades (yeah so extra points for that). Buzzberry makes dog treats, and they gave my corgi pup a free treat when I brought her by! I love the breakfast burrito, iced dirty chai, iced americano... Very good soup, always. Buzzberry is a big part of what makes my neighborhood \"home\" for me."}
{"text":"They're staff is always so friendly and pleasant. Love that they always give my pup dog treats while we wait in the drive thru. I love their breakfast bagels the most and any of the muffins! Everything here is made in house, ill take it any day over McDonald's! And they are now also making fresh juices, thank you!"}
{"text":"Great place with a welcoming atmosphere. Had the cafe au lait and the cafe mocha; enjoyed both very much! Also had a raisin cinnamon bagel with cream cheese. Unlike coffee places I've been to (in Sacramento), Buzzberry is generous with the cream cheese. And I mean generous in an awesome way! Also tried their chocolate chip muffin. I've had chocolate muffins before, but Buzzberry's was like a punch to the stomach, in a good way :-) I would go back, next time I visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place, even told my sister about it! She went before me and didn't like her iced latte but I tried it anyways. I got a coffee with caramel and almond milk and it was so bad I threw it away and went to Starbucks, all on my way to work. Bummed, especially since it was almost $4 for a coffee!"}
{"text":"Blackberry iced tea is great!  Also free wifi.   Food though?  Meh."}
{"text":"Very bland decor. Tropical Escape smoothie was good. My boyfriend got the Bluetiful You and was very dissatisfied. May return to try food but will be sticking to the drive thru from now on. The interior smelled stale."}
{"text":"This place needs a make over...dingy old refrigerator coolers with artificial plants collecting dust... Empty good displays... Beat up furniture that looks worse than goodwill stock... Overpriced food that looks and tastes like a ten year old prepared.... I want the place to do well but it needs to stop embarrassing itself"}
{"text":"Great coffee and fantastic service:  This neighborhood joint is a must when in the area.  It's quiet for study or a private conversation with plenty of comfortable seating.  They have a drive-thru window too if you don't have time to sit.  Plus, they always provide service with a smile!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across  buzzberry as I was going grocery shopping at bashas. It's really nice that they have a drive-through window, and not only do they serve coffee and smoothies, but they have breakfast lunch and dinner as well. My initial complaint was the prices. I don't know if I have ever paid nine dollars for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Needless to say, I did not order it bc of the price, but I really hope it's the most amazing peanut butter and jelly sandwich in the world. If you check in on Yelp you can get a dollar off your order, so the 12 ounce smoothie I ordered ended up being $4.75, not too bad. I ordered the Scottsdale sunrise, which is cherry and pineapple. I also added whey protein. It ended up tasting like a cherry vanilla pineapple smoothie, which I really enjoyed. I would definitely order this again. My only complaint other than the prices, was that the order came in a generic Styrofoam cup with a lid that did not fit, and half of my smoothie was pouring out the side of the cup. I also took quite a while, but I wasn't in a huge hurry, so I didn't bother me too much. I would say it's worth checking out, but keep in mind, the food is overpriced and it's not going to be mind blowing."}
{"text":"After driving by this place dropping my wife off for work many times I decided to give it a try today.

I personally like the randomness of the furniture, it makes it feel more casual and comfortable to spend some time there studying or reading. There must have been some staff turnover as the two staff i encountered were both mid 20's, early 30's and seemed to know their stuff. There was music playing but at a level that it was not annoying or made it hard for me to concentrate as I studied. There is a spot for kids to play games and hang out, which is great I'm sure if you are a soccer mom meeting up for a play date. It was not so great for me when 6 kids under five years old came roaring into the place as I was trying to study. Nothing a good pair of headphones couldn't fix.

I ordered an Iced coffee and thought it was great. Very strong but not bitter at all.

Overall the product and price were good and I will be back for sure.

Only reason for not getting 5 stars is the playground in the corner and it was pretty warm in the building, c'mon, its August in AZ, turn the A/C down a few degrees!"}
{"text":"My friend brought me here and we had an amazing Bloody Mary and the Hoppy B*tch IPA. We also had the Kale and orange bread which was great as well. Chris and Jessica gave us great service! I definitely recommend this place and will be back soon. Good food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Great place to get your coffee, breakfast lunch, or diner as they are 24 hour and always open."}
{"text":"The journey to Buzzberry started off crappily.  I was on my way to work and couldn't turn left at Hayden and Indian Bend due to construction forcing me to drive south (further away from my projected destination) and towards Mcdonald.  I was already running late to work so I didnt have time to eat or drink anything when i passed by Buzzberry and said to myself, damn yo imtired slash hungry what's this all about.  The building is inviting and with an attached drive thru appealing to someone in a hurry/on the go.  The coffee was great and actually gave me some energy, the breakfast burrito was great as well, flavorful and fresh!  Try it out you won't be disappointed, support the little guys F Starbucks, for serious."}
{"text":"I love buzzberry, but (yes, there is a but) it is too expensive.  When it first opened the prices were great! $6.14 for a 20 oz ice blended drink is too much!! If they lowered the price by $1, I would get one all the time because the vanilla ice blended drink is the best. I only get one every now and then because of the price. I love supporting local businesses, bit $6.14 is not reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"Well now you've gone and done it Mister.
It seemed pretty funny at the time, but those brain-disabling farts you cut in the kitchen this morning have now cost you a new Mr. Coffee carafe.
You knew she likes to throw things...what were you thinking?

Don't despair.
Buzzberry will be there to see you through the day.
Stop in for a cup of joe and a blueberry scone, I think they're homemade.

While you're waiting, you can even fantasize about the cute young server who's smiling at you, unlike your wife, whose perma-scowl was the last thing you remember after kissing you with that carafe.
Forget it dummy, you're too old and she gets paid to smile.

Maybe that's the answer.
Tomorrow, when your wife gets out of bed, greet her with a smile and tell her there's a dirty twenty in it for her if she whips up a pot of joe and some scones.

This instead of faux-farting karaoke to White Stripes, Seven Nation Army. 

Chicks don't like that shit for some reason."}
{"text":"Since we live in the neighborhood we want to like this place and have given it a few chances but it's just not very good. 
This morning had gross breakfast burrito. The bacon tasted off and was a weird color and the eggs tasted out of a carton. I mean it's a breakfast burrito there are three ingredients it's not that hard!
My brother had a smoothie last night and said that was below average and overpriced.
Unfortunately I cannot recommend this place."}
{"text":"Time for an update... Still love Buzzberry!  The food, the shakes, the vibe - it all works.  What doesn't? The constant turnover in staff.  New guys can't seem to find things, answer basic questions or ring you up fast without asking for assistance :(  They need to step up their game if they don't want to lose customers.  On several occasions, I have dropped out of the drive-thru cause they were too slow."}
{"text":"Poor service, poor product, high prices, dingy atmosphere.  Even in a pinch, I won't be coming here again.

I ran in for a quick sandwich and there was no one else waiting at the counter - score.  I ordered an egg and cheese croissant ($5.97) which comes with a meat choice.  Instead, I requested sliced tomato.  

The girl behind the register was brand new - no problem.  My order had a substitution, so she had the kitchen start on the sandwich while she kept running back to ask another guy questions.  She apologized for not knowing how to enter the tomato charge.  I said, charge?  I'm not getting meat, and it's a breakfast sandwich.  Finally, the guy came to the front and, when she repeated my extra charge question, he brusquely told her that since that is not how the product is usually made, there's a charge - not a word to me, standing right in front of them.  The total was $8.06....so, I handed over $10 and I got back a dollar and a pile of change...for a breakfast sandwich with no avocado or anything fancy.

By this point, quite a bit of time had gone by, and the kitchen finished my sandwich and called it out.  He hands it to me and has the nerve to say, \"wow, look how quickly we got that out for you!\"

The worst part was when I got home and discovered my $8 sandwich contained those weird, tasteless liquid eggs that come tumbling out all over the place and had a slightly burnt edge.

About the shop itself:  It's the kind of place that makes you feel like maybe you should wash your hands when you leave, which isn't great in an establishment that serves food and drink.  And the wifi is pretty terrible, apparently run from a mi-fi unit, so when I've gone there in the past, the connection was either down entirely, or slow and dropped me every few minutes. The one upside is that it's dog friendly - I'm pretty sure they can come right inside."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite for breakfast. Large menu, probably too large based on the quality I received. Had oatmeal with nuts and honey. Oatmeal was good. The real problem was the Latte, it was easily one of the worst Lattes I've ever had. Dining room is sort of gross and filled with mismatched furniture from Goodwill. This place needs some love and probably to simplify. They're trying to do too much and not doing anything well."}
{"text":"This place if just ok. A little pricey, my drink was good but service was slow. The decor is a mix between your grandmas house and a coffee shop which was weird Nothing makes me want to go back though. Good luck guys."}
{"text":"Buzzberry is great because the smoothies actually taste like fruit.  It's a cute and quirky place."}
{"text":"As I sit here drinking my double espresso from the newly opened Buzzberry, I contemplate the whole support your local business model. 

While I do my best to support local business I know that that the businesses I support are good. Why waste dollars on a business when they have a mediocre product and or service? While the service at Buzzberry was nothing special, I was floored when we asked where they source their coffee. Three teenage somethings just stood there and stared at us blankly. You see Buzzberry touts its self as \"local, small-batch artisan coffee and 100% fruit smoothies\", so you'd think that they would have a selling line, telling us all about the coffee they're proud to serve. Ultimately one of the three said where they get their coffee from but only after moments of debate. As someone who loves and buys artisan products I felt that this was pretty much unacceptable. 

So perhaps I'm being to harsh on them? They have only been opened a month and they are super close to the our homestead. Though as I sit here sipping on my double espresso I figured that they were the ones being a little harsh. Bitter."}
{"text":"What a strange little place, a little beatnik flavor for sure. It could use a cleaning and sprucing. 

I had steel cut oats with bananas and nuts. The banana chunks were mouthful sized and the nuts tasted old to me. Stick to fruit only. 

My boyfriend had a veggie and egg breakfast burrito. It looked decent and was definitely good sized. They cannot do egg whites only. 

The cafe au lait was good and my decaf latte was very good as well. We took an energy bar to go, it looks interesting and smells great but we haven't broken into it yet. I'm curious to see how it is. 

Oh, have a scone for me, they looked amazing."}
{"text":"I am giving it 4 starts for the smoothies alone. 
But this place is majorly annoying so I will probably stop coming, despite the delicious smoothies. 
They ask you 3, 4 and 5 times \"what else you want\" besides the order you've given. how about a cookie? Sandwich or food? You know tonight we have meatloaf? Did I mention we have cookies? What else can I get you besides the Elvis? 
Ughhhhhh Customer lost!"}
{"text":"Tried to go there for breakfast and get something before work. I pull up to the speaker to order and was asked to pull up to the window without ordering. I pull up to the window and wait for 5 minutes. The person tells me she's helping others that are inside. I just left and went to McDonald's across the street."}
{"text":"This place is  meh. Coffee and baked goods are great but they have to hire more people.. the place is slow and a bit overpriced for the quality of their food and sandwiches.I have seen better sandwiches from the gas station than the quality they sell there. Their burritos are good but even the Mexican restaurant in that same plaza has better quality and cheaper.  If you asked me... I'd rather spend my money only their coffee."}
{"text":"Buzzzzz!  

This small cafe/smoothie shop has all the makings of a small business owner.  Feels like walking into some home.  Music in the air and smell of coffee brewing; makes Buzzberry worth the visit.  Free wifi, comfortable couch, and a play area for the kids....pshh...what are they missing?

Anyways, I'm not a big fan of smoothies, but I needed a protein shake.  For what I got I thought it a tad bit pricey, but I'm not going to complain.  I support my local businesses as much as I can.

The smoothie itself, well nothing too special.  It was smooth and it had protein powder.  Didn't give me much of a jolt, but I guess I could have order an expresso. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been some what apprehensive writing this review about the Buzzberry Coffee & Smoothies.  Well my apprehensiveness turned into procrastination because I sooo want to support this small business by writing them a stellar review but after repeated mishaps and poor service during different visits I've come to the conclusion the Buzzberry is what it is ~ Meh, I've experienced better.  

Good~ great location, drive thru, coffee and espresso is OK ~ average, smoothies are made with organic fruit and they offer several energy and nutrional sup's if you like that kind of thing.  The decor is cute and whimsical.  

Not so good~ the ice tea is elf service.  It sits in an urn for who knows how long before they brew more.  It always taste a little stale and sort of bitter.  They have WIFI, however it's password protected so you have to request the password.  Some of the comfy seating has too much wear and needs to be replaced.  

Bad & Ugly~ the service here sucks especially for the prices they charge. Maybe it's my timing but every time I've been to the Buzzberry there are these really young and uncaring girls working.  They are not attentive to their customers nor do they seem to care about this business becoming successful.  Cleaning ~ this place needs a good cleaning.  We did not enjoy our last visit for all of the crumbs, dirt and what not on the floor and tables.  Oh yeah and the girls behind the counter are busy yapping away at each other rather than picking the place up. I can better coffee for less at 32 & Shea...

My last visit I asked to speak to the mgr or owner and I was told she was not in.  I asked them to speak to anyone in charge.  Both girls stated they were in charge so I told them about my disappointments in my repeated visits.  They both just stared at me like deer in a hand light.  

Good luck if you going to try the Buzzberry Coffee and Smoothie!"}
{"text":"I lurv this place. The smoothies, the food, the pastries, the service, the atmosphere all rock. I lurv that they have a punch card for smoothies and coffee so you can get one for free! There's patio seating when it's nice out, tables inside for studying, couches for lounging and a HUGE chess set. Like massive. I will always have fond memories of this chess set, it's where I first learned how to play. 

I lurv that you can add supplements to the smoothies- they've got vitamins and caffeine and other neat stuff. So much better than Jamba Juice simply because they're locally owned and operated by some really nice high school kids. 

You really get a community vibe in this place, there are posters, cards and pictures on the walls made by local kids. I really dig it. 

They're currently waiting for a liquor permit, so I'm excited to see what they do with it!"}
{"text":"Finally a locally owned fruit smoothie joint that uses only organic fruit in their smoothies. What took so long? I'm very particular about the food I eat and typically avoid fruit smoothie places all together. The added sugar, high amounts of carbs, as well as the high calorie content of the smoothie keep me at bay. However, this locally owned place gets it. They use only organic fresh fruit and ice in their smoothies and they taste amazing. Why large corporations feel the need to mess with something nature has spent billions of years perfecting is beyond me.  Buzzberry allows nature to do its thing serving up delicious and healthy smoothies. Keep in mind the serving size, even though it's fruit their large smoothie is huge and can definitely add to your waste line. I've not had the pleasure of trying their food or coffee yet, but if their smoothies are any indication then I think they'll be great.

I also love the fact that it's a chill place to hang out. They have free wifi, comfortable furniture, and great tunes playing. It is a great place to relax and cool off during these insanely hot months. If you're in a hurry they also have a drive thru so you don't even have to leave your car."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place to grab a coffee and bite to eat in the AM.  No-frills decor and order at the counter inside or the drive-thru.  Fresh brewed coffee was good and breakfast burrito with bacon filled me up."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my previous review.  I am pretty sure I got food poisoning from this place a few weeks or a month ago.  Normally it takes a little time to get the food when you order in the drive thru which I don't mind (because it means they're making it fresh) but the time when I went and got sick, I drove up to the window, paid, and they handed me my sausage breakfast burrito right away.  I don't know if it was pre-made or what but when I got home (I live a few minutes away) I took a bite and the eggs and sausage inside the tortilla were kind of cold.  It's not like they were frozen or anything but it made me think it had been sitting around for a while and it was not fresh.  I ate the whole thing and then an hour later I started feeling nauseous.  I had the chills the whole rest of the day and felt like I could not move/eat without getting sick.  It was the only thing I had eaten that day/morning and the previous night I had eaten a light meal earlier in the evening and felt fine until after I ate the breakfast burrito.  I appreciate the concept of this business but I can't come here again or eat another sausage breakfast burrito from anywhere in general."}
{"text":"I like buzz berry for studying and getting a quick bite or hanging out in the between classes. Because it's 24 hours, it's easy to stay there late doing homework which is awesome. Their drinks are okay, I've had better. Some of the employees aren't very friendly, I feel like whenever I order a drink I'm inconveniencing them. There's an older woman who works there that is always so sweet when I go in and she's probably the nicest employee they have there. Overall, it's a cozy place that isn't ever too crowded but if you're not planning to stay in, I would honestly recommend just a drive thru Starbucks."}
{"text":"I've been to Buzzberry's drive through on multiple occasions and it has never disappointed.  They have friendly employees, an awesome coffee selection, homemade almond milk, and great smoothies too.

It wasn't until recently that I decided to go inside, and I was super impressed.  Buzzberry has an incredible food menu too!  I had one of their bran muffins and it was delish.  The barista helping out was telling me about many of their other award winning pastries as well.  I guess I'll have to return soon for a scone or lemon blueberry muffin.  I also noticed several people eating breakfast burritos.  They looked delicious!  I will absolutely be returning soon for one of those - and the great news is that they serve breakfast all day.  

In addition to all of the above, there is free wifi that works well, plenty of seating, clean restrooms, art from local artists on the walls, and both indoor and outdoor seating.  If I lived just a little bit closer, this would be my go-to coffee shop.  They tend to have Yelp check-in offers as well, which of course, I don't remember to use until after I order.

As others have commented, you will pay a bit of a premium for all of these things, but I think it's worth it to support local...

One last thing worth noting: I believe that Buzzberry is open 365 days a year (with limited hours on holidays).  I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Just had a most enjoyable experience @ buzzberry in Scottsdale!  I had their omelet bar w / cheesy potatoes!  (Every Sunday) Delicious! The staff was terrific and  I will certainly add buzzberry to my routine!  See you soon, buzzberry!"}
{"text":"I was VERY hopeful when I found this place conveniently located right off the freeway. They had a seemingly large menu, so being vegan, I was certain I would have no trouble finding something to eat here. There were two people in front of us (they were together) and the employees were chit chatting with them for nearly 10 minutes while taking their order while we waited. I could see cooks and other staff members in the back eating. Once we finally got up to the counter to order, I asked what vegan options they had. The only thing they could tell me was \"oatmeal, that's it.\"  Now, I know this isn't a vegan restaurant by any means, but with as large of a menu as they have, it would have been nice if they at least TRIED to accommodate their customers. I see tons of dishes that could easily be modified, smoothies, etc but they had NO desire to help their customers. Frustrated with their lack of apathy, we got two iced Americanos to go and left. Coffee tasted like drip coffee diluted with water. The vibe I got...,\"this is our menu, our store. If you don't like it, gtfo.\" Just a LITTLE effort would be nice. After all, we are the customers."}
{"text":"Within a short bike ride and everything is always delicious. I love the smoothies but never tried the coffee until today. Woops! I am having a vanilla soy latte and it's waaaayyyy better than Starbucks. There is also free wifi, a nice patio and fans inside blowing gently and making me feel like I'm on vacation. Great locally owned business that also supports other local businesses."}
{"text":"Too many off tasting lattes and undercooked scones, I have stopped going to Buzzberry.  Their consistency definitely lapsed and I find myself going elsewhere for a quality execution."}
{"text":"Every feel like grabbing an Omelet but don't want to wait in a huge line at a brunch spot?  Well have I got the place for you (on Sundays..although I wish it was offered every day :)!  Best made to order Omelet in town..complete with to die for cheesy potatoes!  This is a really nice LOCALLY owned coffee shop!  Very cozy and welcoming ambiance with lots of seating.  Plenty of room to stretch your legs and hang out.  The staff has always been very friendly to me and my pup.  I also like their variety of ice teas and their specialty coffee drink are pretty good too!"}
{"text":"First time here in a long while and was really happy with my food and drink order! Got the Nebraska smoothie and was pleasantly surprised and how good it was!! Also had the egg bowl with veggies, both items made for a great brunch!"}
{"text":"Always friendly and prompt, buzzberry is one of my favorite stops. Oh and the coffee's good too!"}
{"text":"Never go to this place! I paid for three meals in which when I got home I called to notify then they had forgotten items I paid for, easy mistake it happens. But when I called to talk to them. The young lady on the phone called me a liar, told me I could come back or there was nothing they could to do. When I said I live thirty minutes away she said it's too hard to track these things so you either come back or there's nothing there willing to do. She would not let me voice my concern to someone higher than her and then told me I was disrespectful and hung up on me. There food isn't worth the service. If you pay for something you that you don't receive you should be compensate for it when you don't receive it"}
{"text":"I reeeeaaalllllyyy wanted to like this place buuuuuuuut....

What is up with the jailbait working here?   Good lord!   I came here in mid-may about 8:30 AM and neither of the girls working here looked over 18.  We proceed to have the following conversation:

Yeah, what's in the 4 Berry Smoothie?
Umm...I dunno.  It's my first day here
Well, it sounds good.  I'll have one of those anyway.
Ok.  Uh, which one again?
The 4 Berry Smoothie.
4 Berry smoothie.  Anything else?
Oh, and a banana nut muffin
Which one is that?
The one with all the nuts on it.
Ummmm...
Second from the left
This one?
No, my left.
Oh, ok!
Which smoothie did you want again?
The 4 berry.
Ok, 4 berry smoothie and a muffin.
Yep.

Upon exiting the store I peek in the bag and what do I see?   A BLUEBERRY muffin

{"text":"Update:

The manager contacted me and apologized and handled the situation very professionally. I appreciate she is trying to resolve problems that can be out of her control. I'll definitely give this place another try! Food is delish!!"}
{"text":"Had a great Sunday omlet and coffee on 11/20/2011.  Returned on 11/22/2011 for coffee and free WIFI.  Could not connect to the free WIFI with my laptop or iPhone.  Advised attendants that the WIFI needed to be reset.  I had two separate computers that could not connect.  I have never had issues with free WIFI anywhere else, especially with an iPhone.  The attendant told me he would reset the WIFI but it never got reset.  I am visiting AZ from CO.  I really needed the WIFI to take care of some personal business.  The attendant did not seem to care at all that the WIFI wasn't working for me.  I went accross the parking lot to Scottsdale BBQ.  Their WIFI worked great on both of my computers.  I was very disappointed with Buzzberry.  I go out of my way to support small business when they are in direct competition with large national chains.  After this experience, I will not return to Buzzberry.  I will vist the nearby Starbucks for the remainder of the week that I am here for the Thanksgiving holiday."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, buzzberry did not give me a good buzz. The concept got lost somehow because I really thought I was walking into a smoothie, frozen yogurt type of establishment but when we walked in, it was a cafe with a menu of sandwiches, smoothies, etc. I decided to place an order anyway since we were already there. I ordered the banana strawberry smoothie and hubby ordered some other type of smoothie. We decided to leave and enjoy our smoothies on our ride home. 

The smoothies just wasn't that good. It tasted pre-made and not fresh. I could only finish half of my small 12 oz cup and hubby felt the same way. I really expected a lot better especially since we were charged close to $13 for two smoothies that we didn't even finish."}
{"text":"Coffee is great. Service inconstant. Management lacking. 
One of those local places you really hope will have success but does it deserve to survive? Has lasted longer than I would have suspected"}
{"text":"I thought the iced coffee and PB cookie were both really good! The small size is really generous. I went through the drive through and had to wait at the window a little while longer than I had anticipated, but the snack was worth it."}
{"text":"A little expensive, but it is Scottsdale, so that's to be expected sometimes.  The decor is great and the  brew coffee (plain black) I had was excellent. Also had a croissant sandwich, which was good, but a but overpriced for what I got, imo.

I definitely plan on returning and trying our the omelet that I have a check in deal for now. Also seems like a great place to come back and just read and enjoy a good cup o' coffee."}

Hi Larry,

I believe we've fixed the situation with the pricing...our menu artist has been ill and in the hospital.  We've had to scramble to fix his unfinished work.  

Our sincere apologies - and our gratitude for the compliments

It's not that hard. Take a damp paper towel and erase the wrong prices. Let dry. Write in the correct price with colored chalk. Hope I've helped with your issue   Not a big deal for me but, most don't like being overcharged. Oh wait, they actually weren't  overcharged right?"}
{"text":"I order my own smoothie...a chocolate, peanut butter, banana rice milk smoothie when I go here.  Yum.  It's nice to be able to get a vegan treat when I'm on this side of town!!  We usually go thru the drive thru, but the inside's alright.  They have a kid play area, which is super handy when you have little ones.  I also like the giant chessboard inside.  Don't expect it to be too fancy though...the inside looks like someone decorated it with mix matched pieces they found at a garage sale!  Is it terrible for me to say it might have been designed by a man?!  Sorry guys.  Anyway, ignore the insides and go get your treats here!"}
{"text":"Such a nice place to hang out in. Thank God for this place. It's 24/7. So you can sober up after partying in Scottsdale, not to mention the awesome coffee they have."}

The people that work there are so friendly."}

{"text":"tried it for the first time and really enjoyed the turkey cranberry sandwich. extremely Dog friendly can't wait to try the omelet bar on a sunday"}
{"text":"For a small local coffee shop they sure are pricey!   I stopped by for a smoothie, medium coffee and breakfast sandwich and paid WAY more than I expected.  The smoothie was nothing special, similar to the level of a Jamba Juice smoothie (but half the size and cost about the same), and my breakfast sandwich was also just mediocre.  Nothing particularly wrong, but for the price that I paid I expected better quality.  I do like that they have a dog friendly patio, but at those prices my dog and I will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great coffee, great smoothies, great customer service! I just wish they had better wifi."}
{"text":"A deism told me to go here because it's 1sm and I'm hungry.  CAVARAUS was a super cool dude.  This place is awesome and I'll be Back. He the Turkey sandwich with cranberry it was delicious I have the chili also excellent chili"}
{"text":"Mad as hell!! Awful, Terrible service!  This place was great two years ago and now I will never go back!! I ordered a bowl and a cup of the loaded baked potato soup.  I am not sure why it took 25 minutes to prepare.... Maybe because the cook had to take the mashed potatoes from the dinner and add milk and leftover bacon from breakfast to it.  It was HORRIBLE!! 

BUT, the worse part was that the silly high school kid packed the cup on top of the bowl and put the rolls in a different bag.  I did't think to check how it was packed.  Halfway thru my 15 minute ride home, I decided to check the bag. The large lid melted and pushed down into the soup, leaving me with a bag of wet soup. I had to take the smaller one out and place it so it would not spill over and hold the wet soppy bag of soup on my lap to prevent it from spilling onto my $150 newly cleaned and detailed seats. 

When i got home, pieces of plastic lid had mixed in with the soup, preventing me from eating the bowl of soup.   I paid $9.27 for one cup and one bowl of slop, no tasting, mashed potatoes c enough liquid to call it \"soup\". Thank God , I caught the mess before it ruined my seats.  

Why aren't  workers trained to put cups or bowls of soup into one of their plastic to go containers, so it doesn't spill out everywhere.  I know why!  No one in this restaurant cares anymore about the customer !  It is so much more important to have the cashier cleaning up than focusing on the customer... I had to yell to get his attention to find out why soup was taking so long to put in a bowl and cup!!

Don't waste your money here!  There are enough decent sandwich, wine bar, dinner and coffee places in Scottsdale to spend your money with!!"}
{"text":"I walked in, with my kids, and walked out without ordering. This place is more like a bar on the inside, not anything like a cafe or coffee place, and I didn't feel comfortable taking my kids there. If you're looking for a cafe, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The score is based on non-food purchases and atmosphere only....
I am a home-based business person, this is one of my go-to spots when I meet clients. Unlike some of those coffee spots they don't discriminate against those of us that don't drink coffee and only sometimes drink tea. They have all sorts of yummy things on their menu. The smoothies are always my go-to.
One of these days maybe I'll try something boozeberry like!??

I love meeting clients at coffee or juice bars and this one is ALWAYS one that's on my list if it's anywhere in between the client and I!"}
{"text":"This review has nothing to do with the food or the service, mainly because I never got a chance to experience it.  In fact, my sole interaction with this place last week probably lasted a whole of 5 minutes, tops.

I started taking classes this semester, and in an effort to break the work-apartment-work cycle, I started looking for coffee shops that were 24-hour, or at least open late.  So, like the rest of us, I turned to Yelp for suggestions.  Buzzberry: 5am-5am?  Hell yeah!  

A guy comes to the window and looks out at me as I'm parking.  It was pretty late (I headed here after my normal study place closed at 10), so I could understand the curiosity of any one coming to an empty looking establishment.  Looking back, that probably should have tipped me off, but anticipating this place to be open hadn't set off the normal red flags.  I wave at him, he walks off.  No big deal.  I get out of my car, go to the door, and... it's locked?  The dude is sitting in plain sight at the bar area, laptop open, back to me.  I tapped on the door, pulled the bar, and all but banged on it to get his attention.  He does not even acknowledge the fact that I'm there.

After a few minutes of awkward confusion, I looked for the hours of operation sign and found out why I was being ignored: The lobby is not 24 hours; the drive-thru is.

That's why this review is getting 1 star.  Granted, this is a mistake on Yelp's part and the fact that they have no real website up doesn't help, but the guy knew I was there.  He could have at least turned to face me and tell me the lobby was closed, instead of letting me stand outside in the cold with a bag full of books, knocking on the door and looking like a total idiot.  The food may be great, the service (If you get it) may be amazing but I WILL NOT be coming back here."}
{"text":"I don't understand the bad reviews at all, and mostly feel those people are pure- bread drama queens, or competitors... And the lady that reviewed without even eating the food? Are you kidding? 
Anyway, the food is great, it's pricey for a drive thru, but I wish all drive thrus served high quality food like this joint. The breakfast sandwiches are great, lunch sandwiches are delicious, the smoothies are excellent and healthy (no ice cream inside), and their service is friendly. It's not a Wendy's so food doesn't come to the window lickety split, but well worth the wait as they make it fresh. It's a casual family and dog friendly cafe. Try and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. It is so close to home, and it's dog friendly...but the food quality has gone downhill and so has the customer service. I love supporting local businesses, but I have since opted to drive down the street a little further for better food and drinks, with better prices."}
{"text":"Very nice staff & tasty food! Came here for breakfast on a Sunday, and we loved the breakfast burritos, muffins and Elvis smoothie. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Not only is this place close to my house, but it's open 24/7. You didn't misread that... Isn't that awesome? Coming from NYC, it's a rarity to find the conveniences of home from places open that late and often. 

Almost everything on their menu is homemade. Their scones and muffins are flavorful and are a decent size. Their coffee is so good. Their omelets and burritos are the bomb. I love their chorizo ones best. The burritos come with homemade salsa. 

They also have dinner and lunch options and I haven't tried them yet but I will be as soon as possible. The menu is extensive and they also offer up Mimosas and Bloody Mary's on the weekend (obviously these are only dine-in options)."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place a few times, and finally stopped in. I came for coffee and I would say first & foremost this place IS a coffee shop, but it's really (a lot) more.

I got an ice coffee & a chocolate chip muffin. The coffee was fine, but the muffin was REALLY good! I could have inquired, but I got the impression this place does most (all?) of there food in house. The muffin was very fresh (and I was here late morning) & was loaded w/chocolate chips. The other muffins looked good as well.

I'd be curious to come back to this place to try some other stuff. For breakfast they do a lot more than just pastries. They also have breakfast sandwiches & burritos. For lunch they have sandwiches & salads. They also do a different homemade dinner each night after 5 pm, which I'd be curious to try. 

They also advertise an omelette bar on the weekend (or it may have been EITHER Saturday or Sunday...I can't remember) along w/mimosas an Bloody Mary's. 

Speaking of which, this place serves alcohol (beer & wine at least, but I think they advertise cocktails). 

In addition to ALL this they're also open 24 hrs & have a drive thru."}
{"text":"Does Buzzberry not use espresso shots in their iced lattes anymore? I ordered an iced latte, and they didn't use any espresso shots, but a cold premixed coffee base. It tastes horrible!"}
{"text":"I'm nervous to write a negative review. It seems that Molly of Buzzberry only responds with sarcasm and denial when customers like myself have a less-than-great experience.

First off, check my past reviews.... I hardly EVER leave a bad review. I support and encourage small businesses! I believe I'm fair when I critique my experiences. 

Buzzberry at one point was GREAT! I live just down the street so I would frequent this place often with my dog. I have always loved that they were pet-friendly! 

Now, I don't know what in the world changed, but this place has gone downhill biiiiig time. The lattes are inconsistent and bland. I used to have dreams about their baked goods but now they're mediocre at best.

To top it off, it's no longer cozy inside and the employees are unfriendly. I feel like I'm inconveniencing their staff just by walking through the door...

I hope Molly (or whoever runs the place) takes the criticism not as a personal attack but as honest customer feedback. I for one would love to have the OLD Buzzberry back!"}
{"text":"I will try to keep this simple.

As far as prices go...get on the mailing list for the fantastic deals.

The coffee ( I drink plain old coffee) is superior!  I also leave majorly buzzed ;)  I love S-bucks, and I can say with all honesty, I prefer the jo at b-berry.

My wife loves the smoothies.

Our 20 month old toddler loves playing in the kids corner, flirting with the girls that work there, the bananas, the antique typewriter, but most of all the flip lid on the red garbage can.

We love the owner Kate, and we will keep coming back!

GO LOCAL!!!"}
{"text":"Booze smoothies, breakfast food, beers on tap, solid coffee and gourmet dog treats? This place has it all.

A little more rum in my Tropical Escape would have been nice. I couldn't taste or feel it."}
{"text":"I paid $9 for 2 smoothies that were the size of a Mormon sacrament cup (literally), one of which tasted like fake fruit juice and was extremely watered down. The other was good, but definitely not good enough to go back again."}
{"text":"I have been visiting Buzzberry since the first day they opened. It has consistently gotten better and better. All of the baked goods are now baked fresh there daily and are delicious. The Elvis smoothie is my kids favorite and am now stopping there almost daily for it. My favorite is the green tea citrus mint. The flavor is refreshing on a hot day and healthy anytime. They have a drive thur if your in a hurry. If not in a hurry it's fun to hang out play checkers and chill."}
{"text":"It was the morning on Thursday, i was giving it an attempt because it was like right next to where I am working! I ordered two breakfast burritos. I asked the lady didn't have to put the scrambled eggs and cheese in my burritos. Rather simply putting potatoes and include some vegetables in the burritos.She charged me one dollar extra in light of the fact that I only asked to have a couple potatoes and she didn't charge me this time for the single green leaf of lecture. Does it make sense when you charge me one dollar extra since burritos support to have potatoes in it? 

   The even worst thing was the awful attitude that the lady gave to me. This is really bad customer service for a place like this to be on Scottsdale town. I guessed she didn't like it when I only purchased 2 small items on the menu.

   The fun part was when I returned to the office. I found out that: the first burritos, they put more than enough scrambled eggs like enough for 3 people to eat it and one slide of bacon and for the second burritos, they put one single green lecture leaf and one slice of bacon plus a few dices of potatoes not even peeled off the skin. The thing that surprised me was the bacon was not even cut small pieces and I don't think they knew how to make burritos. I knew that you are not authentic Mexican restaurant but at least try to make it look like burritos. Please care more for the customer even tho they only purchased small items on the menu.

NEVER GOING TO COME BACK AGAIN FOR THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Perfectly good, average but not typical coffee shop in what appears to be an old convenience store space.

I have to say that their iced coffee was better than most I've had -- strong and smooth like the stuff made in a toddy.  But then there's the downside....

As comfy/funky as the space was, there was just something off about it and I can't quite say what it was.  But if I'm in the neighborhood again, I'll stop in and check it out to see how this relatively new coffee shop is coming along."}
{"text":"Long wait to order when only 2 others in line. Over 9 dollars for mediocre chicken Caesar salad with questionable romaine & runny Caesar dressing & bland tasting chicken. I agree with some other reviewers that it's rather dingy inside. Wish it would have been better. So close to work."}
{"text":"I honestly should come to this place more.  It is my neighborhood coffee place and I should support it.  For whatever reason though, I never think to come here to get my coffee.

The people here are really awesome and friendly.  They have yummy \"Buzzberry Chai\"  that is blackberry-ish flavored.  I get mine dirty and it really is fabulous.

My son likes their smoothies.  I have sips and they are quite good.

I like that they have a drive-through.  I am all about drive-throughs before I have had my morning coffee!"}
{"text":"I'm sure this place saved my life. When I stumbled in, too dazed to read the menu, I said \"Make something that will cool me off, please.\" (no, not hot coffee). 

That's how I ended up drinking a Berry Blast smoothie. It was refreshing, and as I slowly came back to life, I looked around at the interior. We were sitting on a couple of couches, which I'm sure were in my Grandma's house back in the '50s, but the place was huge with somewhat interesting decor. I'm not sure if one could call it \"hipster\" in this neighborhood, and I didn't see any hipsters. In fact, I didn't see anyone except my own party of four. If Buzzberry, however, set up shop down near 7th and Roosevelt, it might become hipster. 

If I find myself in this neighborhood and in need of resuscitation in the future, I'll be back for another smoothie. The hubby had a beer."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It used to be my Saturday ritual to bring my laptop and get some writing done (I should start that up again!). Good coffee, comfortable environment that only a local coffee shop can really create plus they are 24 hour. I'll say that again, 24-HOUR!!!! And have a drive thru and a bar! I've never ordered a drink there but tempting! You could quite literally spend the whole day there and might want to. 

Also, (because those that read my reviews know how dog obsessed I am) they give treats to dogs! Actually, I think they are even allowed here. I've seen people bring dogs on the patio and even in the coffee shop but as a courtesy I would ask before bringing your dog inside but that's just me..."}
{"text":"This is a great little locally owned coffee/smoothie shop that is a cozy/chill place to hang out.  Love that they have a drive through too.

Their coffee is consistently good and it's nice that they carry almond milk.  This is my favorite new smoothie spot - the smoothies are delicious, they make all fruit smoothies with organic ingredients.  

The staff is also very friendly - its nice to find a great coffee shop that is not a chain."}
{"text":"I love this place! I went by the other day for a coffee and ended up getting the large iced white mocha made with their homemade almond milk.... Yep! Homemade! It was incredible. Beats Starbucks and Dutch bros any day! And also grabbed a dinner for the evening - pulled pork sandwich on pretzel bun with scalloped potatoes and green beans. I was in heaven! Cant say enough good things bout this place :) So grateful you are in our neighborhood. Now if you could just open one in Tempe that would be great as I am moving that way in a few months....."}
{"text":"I like Buzzberry, for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Never disappointed and I've been here several times. Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"When visiting my mother in law, I come here every morning. It is wonderful to have such a lovely place right across the street! The coffee is delicious, and I have tried several of their baked goods, which have all been yummy. Anxious to try a bistro dinner sometime. Staff is very welcoming and friendly, and my 3 year old loves the little toy area."}
{"text":"Nice staff and a great vibe to the store. Ordered the breakfast burrito and the berry blast shake with peach! It was great and I ended up play chess with my friend while waiting for the food.

This is a great post hike spot for food and a cool down. I highly recommend for an alternate to LGO!"}
{"text":"Spent an early morn-afternoon on the comfy leather couch here working on my laptop, drinking tons of coffee and people-watching.  The staff was friendly, helpful, yet not intrusive or overbearing.  The perfect balance.  The choc-chip muffin (warmed up for me to the perfect melted-chocolate face-wiping temperature) was deeeelicious.  I was comfy, treated kindly, and enjoyed the quality of service.  One of the more cozy coffee houses I've been to, tho the windows could use some dressings, as there's a lot of glass letting in too much light.  Could be cozier, but I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great 24 hour coffee shop and bistro. One caveat-only order the baked goods in the morning, by the afternoon/evening they tend to be dried out. The coffee is good and the service is friendly. Unlike most coffee shops they have alcohol so it is a good brunch place. The beer selection is geared towards out of state beers and really not that exciting.  They also have sandwiches and after 5:00 P.M. a daily dinner special that for a coffee shop is usually pretty good. Casual coffee shop vibe inside and a dog friendly patio outside."}
{"text":"Great late night place. Open 24hours and the coffee is good.

This place has its own spin on coffee shop. It's a far throw from a Starbucks in favor of a more lounge like atmosphere. Seating is sometimes limited when it's busy.

The food here can be hit or miss. The chilli and soup us top notch, but I didn't fall in love with their buscits and gravy.

I still love this place and visit frequently."}
{"text":"I stopped in at the Buzzberry after figuring out how close it was to my house and seeing a few favorable reviews on Yelp! 

It was Monday morning I even got up a little  earlier for work just so I could sneak in this \"little secret\" smoothie house. Now one quirky thing about me is that I love drinks and not always the adult kind. 

So the first thing that I was surprised by was the atmosphere and set up inside was not very inviting. With a name like Buzzberry I am expecting a pretty cool and flashy inside. Instead I got a lets find a bunch of cool stuff at garage sales and through it together type atmosphere. 

Now on to my morning beverage. I went with a berry smoothie. Now I have to admit it was decent. It was  a blend of four berries and was big. My complaint is that it could have been thicker and have a little more flavor. 

If I am around Buzzberry and am in the mood for a no frills smoothie I won't think twice on stopping in again."}
{"text":"Everyone was so nice!!!! And helpful. Definitely going back next time I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"Love this place and the convenience!  Would have given 5 stars but $8 for a smoothie is a tad pricey."}
{"text":"Great little cafe. I love their service and the fact that they allow dogs( plus they have little treats for them too). I go here almost everyday I can to do my homework. Prices are low, which is great for anybody(especially students) and just a great atmosphere to do homework or just chill out. Wifi works great too"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Great atmosphere and incredibly student friendly. If you're looking for a late night coffee shop/cafe that isn't packed with people, this is the place for you. I would especially recommend this place for the studious, late night, students who want peace and quiet. 

The only reason I can't give this place a 5 star is that the food and coffee are a bit more expensive compared to other cafes. 

pros:
Has a little bit of everything 
quiet 
24/7 

cons:
price 
staff is sometimes slow."}
{"text":"I would like to update my review. I used to go to Buzzberry probably 2-3 times a week because I live down the street and it is convenient to grab something before I go into work. Over the past years I have ordered many things which I will list below:  

Vanilla latte hot/iced- both undrinkable and extremely bitter. Iced coffee with cream and sugar free vanilla- just ok. Peach green iced tea w/ sugar free vanilla- good, usually my go-to.  Iced hazelnut mocha hot/ iced- again pretty undrinkable, very bitter with strange taste. Pumpkin spice latte( this was touted as the best PSL around) it was a absolutely the worst, strangest tasting one I have every had. Threw it in the trash. Pretty much any of their espresso drinks are awful. If you get a drink with their homemade almond milk it separates and tastes awful. Blended iced drinks- vanilla, hazelnut, red velvet- good although I was recently told they can't do hazelnut even though I have gotten it in the past. One time a new male employee made something totally different that seemed like he actually blended a latte- weird, not the normal formula and watery- threw it out. Breakfast burrito regular- ok, small, just the basics- cheddar cheese,egg,and a meat choice(bacon), twice I received it cold. Monster burrito- usually good , but today it came with no sour cream and no jalapeños- disappointing. Toasted everything bagel w/cream cheese- 3 out of the last 4 times I have ordered it came un-toasted.  Chocolate chip - good, dense, large.
Hawaiian biscuits- ok, sweet, served warm.  NOTE: Twice I have looked in the drive-thru window and seen the male chef not wearing any gloves and handling my food.

I'm giving one star for inconsistency,  high pricing, and very bad espresso drinks which should be something that is mastered at a coffee place. The employees are generally very nice, outgoing and talkative, but sometimes I will get one that is clearly having a terrible day. I did have one recent experience with a newer employee who was curt with me and just talked trash about the customer behind me with the window open. 

Will I be back? No. Unfortunately it seems like the \"avoid\" items are increasing. After reading Molly, the owner's sassy, rude and outrageous replies to customers on yelp I would never give them another cent!"}
{"text":"First time in and I ordered several sandwiches and smoothies for myself and my family. The service was very quick and friendly. The atmosphere was awesome and refreshing. The food rocked and was healthy food little kids even liked! It is a great place to get everything you are craving! I love neighborhood places like this and I will definitely will be returning!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly I love buzzberry but I really wish someone would teach the cook how to make scrambled eggs for breakfast sandwiches. They always end up in such small pieces that they completely fall out of the sandwich. Stop moving them around so much in the pan!"}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I came here tonight craving some smoothies and reluctantly, found this place open 24 hours, with immunity boosts for your smoothies. Not to mention the smoothies tast wonderful & its great price for 32oz! The service was absolutely delightful, the man serving us was such a kind person and we definitely would recommend this place to anybody! They even have booze to add to your drink and a cool loungy type area inside. 5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"This place is ok... I don't love their coffee and after adding protein to a smoothie it cost nearly $10. I can get the equivalent for no more than $6 up the street. The food items are overpriced and nothing special in comparison to Buzzberry's competitors in town. Id much rather drive through D'Lish or stop at Olive & Ivy Marketplace or Chop Shop!"}
{"text":"Love this joint!!!  Only wish it was closer to oldtown so i could visit daily!    The americanos are strong and cheap!  3 bux for 3 shots- pretty great!  The place is comfy with lots of relaxing chairs and tables. 

 Yes, its not the most modern place but when I want to relax and hang out with my americano, this is the type of place I want. It feels hippy/local which is perfect for when you arent in a rush. I dont find it dirty, they have a non-Starbucks vibe which makes it \"cool\".  (Btw, I also like Starbucks but it just has a different kind of atmosphere.)

Yes the workers are chattty with each other but I find them very friendly and down-to-earth. They move quick enough for me but I do want to admit that am not in a hurry when i go there.

I think this is a great place and appreciate that they arent a chain and support the community so much!

Please help keep them in business :)"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Came in for a cup of coffee and had an awesome breakfast sandwich. People are friendly and great service."}
{"text":"***Update*** So I will gladly give buzzberry it's last star to make it a 5/5. The owner reached out to me privately about my last dining experience and I'm so glad she did. I used to go to buzzberry every now and then but the owners commitment to excellence as a local business has won me over and you can now call me a regular because I will be sure to come back all the time. I returned and ordered half a BLT, Peppered beef soup, and..... a biscuit. I IMMEDIATELY noticed a huge difference in the biscuit I got today from last time. This one was warm, it's buttery, soft, and melt in your mouth delish!! The last one I received must have been a fluke or a bad batch. 



I enjoy their breakfast sandwiches, coffee, and smoothies. I've also ordered the chili which came with a biscuit. If I were you I would pass. The chili lacked flavor and the biscuit was... weird. Dense, not flavorful and really dry."}
{"text":"A nice spot to stop for coffee or a smoothie - I have yet to try their breakfast food. The place is cute and it is located about 1/2 block from my house - so I have no good excuse for visiting as infrequently as I do... (I promise I will work on it).

*Glad they took over this long-abandoned spot.
*Open the drive-thru dammit!
*Patio is dog-friendly."}
{"text":"We like to grab a quick coffee on the weekends here, the employees really do a great job of moving quickly and politely. Cool drive thru coffee place built out of an old brakes repair shop. Little pricey but quality espresso and efficient service

Mid Scottsdale Coffee and light brunch - 4.25 Stars"}
{"text":"I dig this spot.... smoothies are refreshing on a hot day. I love all of the smoothies. I have not had a chance to sample the food, but the next time I stop by, I will check it out. The decor is cool af. I like the shabby chic feel to it. I love to support local businesses,  so I will be back."}
{"text":"Just happened on this place on a hot, hot day in July. We were all parched and so a beverage seemed like a good idea.

We went in and the choices were amazing. If you want a fruit-flavored smoothie, you will be able to get it here. Well, maybe not snozberry or butter-berry or Cajun-cream-pie-berry, but you will find the usual and not-so-usual flavors here.

And not to be outdone by Bob Evans and his famous singing cows, this place will serve you a daily special that will remind you of your mama fighting with the chickens on the homestead as they protect their precious eggs. Will it be spaghetti and meatballs or fish and chips today?

AND you can even get a good, imported beer here. This is heaven on a budget with comfortable chairs and lots of stuff on the walls to read.

Try buzzberry, you will be surprised!"}
{"text":"Breakfast bagels, blueberry muffins, and their smoothies are amazing. Never a complaint great service too! Great lounge area as well..."}
{"text":"OK, for someone who lived in Oregon for years (home of many nationally owned and thousands of locally owned coffee shops), and studied in Vienna (practically the birthplace of the coffee (cafe') salon), I am extremely particular about my coffee shops.  Buzzberry ranks as one of my favorites here in the valley, for many reasons.

Soooo much cozier than your typical Starbucks, the atmosphere is fun and eclectic, with random pieces of furniture set to allow the feel of multiple smaller 'living room' type areas to sit with friends.  They also have outdoor tables, and while I wouldn't necessarily call it a \"patio' area, it still gets the job done when the weather in Phx is nice enough to allow outdoor seating.

The coffee choices are great, and their smoothies are AMAZING!! I am partial to a blend of tangerine/peach that is to die for, but you can pretty much create your own - and they're all natural.

Lets get to breakfast.  They offer typical coffee shop fare such as muffins and bagels, and some soup and sandwich selections as well if you happen to be there at lunchtime.  But my ALL TIME favorite is Sunday brunch, where you can get a made-to-order omelette with cheesy potatoes and a croissant that make you wish every day was Sunday morning!

The staff are so friendly and helpful, and the owner, Kate, is absolutely charming.  They also offer free WiFi for those that want to get caught up on emails or schoolwork outside the home.  My friends and I spend hours here every weekend, just being lazy and enjoying each other's company.  I suggest you do the same!"}
{"text":"Horrible and rude customer service both times I've been there.   Told the manager I was allergic to certain foods and wanted a simple substitution on a menu item and they wanted to double the price on me. I will never be back."}
{"text":"Got a chance to try dinner here!! It's Monday so it was chicken pot pie night, not only was it amazing, but the biscuit was FANTASTIC. A side salad was also included with lots of veggies. I absolutely have to make this my stop for Monday nights! Cannot wait to try the rest of their dinners. 
The staff here is also incredible! Very sweet and caring. My pup also loves the complementary dog treats when we go through the drive thru!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend just moved to this area and Buzzberry is just down the street which makes me SO HAPPY. 

Now, I had been wanting to try this place for months because I pass by it often on my way home from work. I finally tried it a couple weeks ago and can whole heartedly say I will be a regular customer. 

The first time there I just got a plain coffee but my boyfriend tried their London Fog drink and can't stop saying how amazing it was. He said it tastes like Fruit Loops, I beg to differ, but nonetheless it's still really tasty. 

The next time we went, we spent more time looking at the menu and we ended up splitting the double order of the biscuits and gravy which was more than enough for two!! The gravy and biscuits are made in house and they are so delicious, a very inexpensive and yummy take on your traditional biscuits and gravy.

We are so excited to head back and try more of their menu options. On Sundays, there is a lady on site that makes made-to-order omelets and eggs. Also, they have designated dinners for take away or dine in during the week that look so hearty and yummy. 

If you're looking for a local, nice and relaxing spot for tea, coffee, and scrumptious homemade food, this is your spot! It's also very dog friendly! Lastly, if you check-in on Yelp, $1 off your order every time!"}
{"text":"buzzberry is bizarre. i go a lot because i live right next to it, and they serve coffee, which i need sometimes.

buzzberry hasn't really forged its identity - it's a coffee shop, but they also make hot breakfast (sometimes), serve lunch, and booze, and dinner(?????????). and if you order a coffee, just a coffee, no matter how early in the morning, those poor employees are gonna be like \"oh don't forget, we're serving white chicken chili tonight for dinner!\" because the dinner thing was clearly a terrible idea and no one is getting it. attn coffee shops: the LAST thing i want to think about when i'm ordering a coffee is goddamn beef stroganoff with nasty wet egg noodles, or whatever weird enchilada recipe y'all came up with 

to summarize: it's too expensive, and it's kind of a weird place to hang out (as opposed to cartel, or that place on hayden (aviation? altitude? something)), but it's friendly and convenient so i hope they don't close. although i think it's a distinct possibility that they will because it's a poorly managed business [SORRY BUZZBERRY OWNER I STILL LIKE YOU...IT IS WHAT IT IS]

also ALWAYS do the yelp check in here because it's a dollar off

- robbo"}
{"text":"I used to go here daily a couple years ago. I loved it. But tonight made me never want to step foot in this place again. 

I stood at the counter waiting to order for over 5 minutes. And keep in mind that I'm literally the only customer in the place. There's 3 workers standing around and talking. One girl was washing something. But she walked by twice, and it's hard to believe she didn't see me standing there. So I tried getting her attention by saying excuse me. And raising my voice louder thinking she couldn't hear me. I was actually yelling at her to get her attention. Then she casually just looked up and with zero urgency, walked towards the counter. I ordered my medium coffee and was rightly pissed off that she barely even apologized for ignoring me. 

Then to make matters worse, I saw on my bank statement that she charged me 3.51 for a medium cup of coffee. (Which on the menu is listed as 2.55) I don't care about the $3.50, that's pocket change. It's the fact that she didn't even offer to buy my cheap cup of black coffee for having ignored me, and then to over charge me, are you kidding me? 

Ive worked as a barista, not only are you supposed to make the customers feel wanted and appreciated, but to make sure the customer leaves happy. Overcharging for a crappy cup of black coffee is ridiculous, especially when my experience was so terrible to begin with. 

Obviously she did not receive a tip."}
{"text":"Super cute place. I love supporting non corporate places such as this.  Great selection of food, beer, wines, coffee, smoothies, pastries, etc. Free wifi and some eclectic furniture to get comfy on. Nice patio out front, open late and a drive thru to boot. Community board, local art and complimentary reading material as well.
Employees are super friendly and service was quick. Prices are a tad on the steep side but other than that I really love this place. Also got a $1 off deal when I did a Yelp check in. Awesome. If you're in the area please stop in and support these guys instead of Starbucks!"}
{"text":"I recently moved by this little coffee shop, that ends up being so much more. As for the coffee drinks, they're really good. Admittedly a Dutch Bros addict, not quite as good or as much selection, but much better than the corp green mermaid, for sure. Took my kids to eat on a Sunday when they did the omelette bar, and was amazing. Omelettes to order & you can even make an omelette burrito...comes with cheesy potatoes that are delicious & a muffin. My son had the chile con carne, which was deceptive by the name, I expected it to be more like a Mexican red chile dish, but was standard American chili..but, it was probably the best chili we've ever had & came with a huge homemade biscuit. Will definitely go back for these items. Today I tried the biscuit breakfast sandwich which was good, but a little too much bread for me even though the biscuits are amazing. You'll need a fork to eat this huge sandwich. My daughter gets the smoothies & loves them. I'd say the drinks are a little pricey, but the food is all homemade & reasonably priced. They recently started a loyalty program so customers can earn points towards free drinks/food, so that is a huge appreciated perk! Will be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Everything is made fresh and I have not had anything I didn't like! They are always super friendly and quick, I can't wait to try their dinner! The one downside is they are pretty pricy, but sometimes you have to pay more for better quality!"}
{"text":"We got two smoothies from the drive thru. I got a scottsdale sunrise and my husband got a world's best. Mine is very tasty. The perfect treat after hiking that giant mountain. And it's always open. I can't complain!"}
{"text":"What a gem of a place. Neighborhood secret. Open 24 hours! Great breakfast, daily blue plate dinner specials, coffee and smoothies. Great service.
 Can also get a glass of wine there for very reasonable places. A \" must go \" if you are anywhere near."}
{"text":"A great little cafe sorely needed in the neighborhood.  I like to take my six-year-old daughter there for a smoothie.  We hang out reading books."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place SO badly and throw it into my weekend morning routine. Cute (from the outside) local joint, dog friendly patio, about a mile's walk from my house, beer on tap...but it's just not working. At all. The 4 star-rating as averaged on Yelp was pretty misleading unfortunately.

The interior is a little dank, which is fine if you're not into atmosphere. Not that I think every coffee shop should scream corporate remodel, but there is a way to tastefully execute shabby-chic and then there is disheveled. It's kind of like the island of misfit coffee shop decor found its way here rather than a cute modgepodge of retro sweet consignment finds that could potentially make this look work. The furniature was definitely wobbly and the patio setup a little awkward. Nice to have water bowls for the pups though.

Design aside - the coffee was terrible. Just terrible. The brewed coffee tasted like hot water that happen to be brown. The \"americano\" was equally tasteless. After receiving the full bakery tour (including a detailed explanation of every item provided free of charge by the eager barista), I settled on the almond poppyseed muffin. Not bad - but pretty crumbly. The dogs liked it at least. My hubby's bagel sandwich looked like it was going to be our best bet. Le sigh. A quick lift of the top exposed what appeared to be rubber cheese - you know the kind. When I argued that perhaps they used quality sliced cheddar, my hubs replied \"I made enough grilled cheese as a bachelor to know what a Kraft single tastes like.\" No rebuttal. And no returning."}
{"text":"I waited a long time to write this review hoping Buzzberry would get better, but inconsistent and overpriced is what keeps coming to mind.  Breakfast sandwich is way too much egg, made with what seems like Costco ingredients and  upwards of $6, I don't mind paying for quality but the price doesn't match the product. It had the potential to be an awesome neighborhood spot but have never delivered on he potential.  Hopefully it can still come around but I'm not holding my breath.."}
{"text":"I use to really love this place. But the last 6 months it's really gone down hill. The coffee is undrinkable multiple times cause they over steam the soy. The staff seems annoyed that your there. Then the topping in the cake, we muffin, was the \"chocolate chip\" muffin I got today. 6 chips!! It was under cooked to boot. For the price they charge it should be better food and customer service. I miss the old buzzberry"}
{"text":"I loved Buzzberry and now it is taken over by BEANberry!! It is NOT the same as Buzzberry. Food is mediocre now and the service is not good. Do not be fooled by this new place because....I repeat.... it is NOT THE SAME. I am giving this 5 stars only because Beanberry doesn't have a page yet and I don't want to mess with Buzzberry's star average."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee, convenient drive-through, healthy smoothie options available and incredibly nice staff.   Can't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"Hmm. Two stars feels mean, so I'll go with three. This place ain't that great. The ambiance is a little stale and uncomfortable. It's not a 'cozy' type coffee place. Almost industrial, arranged and furnished like a cafeteria.  

I had coffee cake and house coffee. The cake was really cakey and a bit dry. Kinda disappointing. The coffee was okay, but not good like you'd hope for in a little, independent place like this.

Service was indifferent."}
