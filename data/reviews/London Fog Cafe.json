{"text":"I just found my new breakfast haunt! The food is VERY good and reasonably priced...open access to coffee while you stay for your breakfast or lunch.  I will most definitely tell all of my friends about the excellent food and service."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite cafe in the city! Great coffees, lunch options and even baked goods. The staff are incredibly friendly and the borscht tastes exactly like how mom makes it at home! Always worth a visit"}
{"text":"Frequent this lovely little sandwich/soup shop.  I've always enjoyed their great food. However; today was a disappointment. While waiting for my soup n'sandwich; I witnessed the gentleman making my sandwich drop the dish-cloth on the floor.  Knowing I was watching he put is aside and used this disgusting scrubbie to wipe down the large cutting knife.  Not using hot water or any soap.  It was quite disgusting.  He then proceeded to finish making my club sandwich then used the contaminated knife to cut my sandwich.  The soup was a cream/bacon potato filled with clumps of thickening agent.   Needless to say, I didn't eat my sandwich and didn't enjoy my gluey/clumpy soup.  I will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"New ownership (since Dec. 2017) took over and the quality isn't what it used to be. The products seemed to have been substituted (too salty) for a cheaper price, but charges for the same if not a little more. The coffee was just a really poor quality and too hot; I couldn't finish it. The service was great but the quality of the product did not justify the price.   You can be sure that most of us can do a better job at making a simple sandwich, salad & coffee at home. This original owners were the reason I kept coming back as I get the homey feel type for food & service, it is sad to see them go."}
{"text":"This is a nice little cafe with simple but high-quality food.  They have really good sandwiches and homemade soup.  They have breakfast sandwiches, too.  It is a small room and can get crowded on weekends.  However, last time I was in I asked for a chai tea on ice, and the woman working had no idea what I was talking about LOL.  Perhaps the \"baristas\" could use a bit more training."}
{"text":"London Fog Cafe is officially my new favourite coffee joint in town and y'all KNOW how picky I am when it comes to coffee joints!  Where do I start?   First of all, the service is EXCEPTIONAL. THE best service I have had in a coffee cafe EVER. Run by Len and Pat, this place feels like you're a part of the family. Len and Pat go out of their way to ensure your drink is EXACTLY the way you want it. I was being a total pain, but that didn't matter, when I got my drink, it was PERFECT. They custom- made me my very own 'Sapna G. London Fog' and daaamn, it was delicious!  Not only does London Fog Cafe carry teas, lattes, coffees and juices, but their food menu is unlike any I've ever seen at a coffee cafe. They have potato pancakes ($1 each!), nachos, cabbage rolls, sausage rolls, homemade baked goods that will have you salivating within seconds, sandwiches, omelettes, tarts, meatballs, Borscht, squares, and the list goes on and on.  The pricing is fantastic, the ambiance is inviting and the service, like I said, is the BEST in town.  If you're not already a regular, GET ON IT! Oh, and when you're there, makesure you tell Pat & Len that Sapna G. says 'Hi' ;)"}
{"text":"Quiet, family-run neighborhood place that you don't see too often anymore. Tried both a BBQ beef lunch sandwich special with borscht soup on my first visit, and their bagel breakfast sandwich on a second visit, and they were both pretty good, and taste very wholesale and home made. Also tried a homemade butterscotch cookie that was tasty.  I don't know what one reviewer experienced, but staff were friendly to me...not in a overly warm, in-your-face way, but they did their job with a smile, and I was kindly offered a glass of water with my meal both times.  Haven't tried their coffee yet, so I can't comment on that. Prices though for drinks, breakfast and sandwiches are very reasonable, and I thought both my meals were of good value."}
{"text":"My favorite place to pick up my London Fog each morning, without syrup please. Great people, great service, great homemade food. Get away from the main stream for a while.   Len and Pat rock!"}
{"text":"I agree with the reviews below. This place has a home-like atmosphere. Every time I visit, I order food from the most charming couple. The prices are reasonable and since I work nearby, this is one of my favorite lunch places to go to, especially on days when I don't feel like deliberating over where to eat.  Although I have to admit the coffee and food aren't gourmet quality, but it certainly achieves a comfort-food level. My favorite items to have there are their mocha and their cabbage rolls"}
{"text":"I think this is the BEST Chicken Caesar Wrap I had! They used grilled chicken instead of most places with cold cut chicken. The chicken was nice and juicy and well-seasoned. Inside is just simple Cesar Salad, but simple is the best! The only downside is the wrap a quite hard to pick up. It would be better is it's wrapped tighter? On the side you can pick from chips or salad. I went with salad with raspberry vinegrette. I also like they use Torani Syrup. My favourite syrup :D"}
{"text":"I made a Yelp account just to make sure I could review The London Fog! My boyfriend and I have been coming here regularly for at least 2 years now, and we have never found anything that quite compares. The quality of the food is never compromised and we have never had a bad experience. The couple who own the cafe know us by name and are always so friendly.  The London Fog is the ultimate small-town, comfort food location. You can't beat the welcoming feeling and oh my goodness, DO NOT go here without ordering their namesake, the London Fog! Until I tried that drink, I did not like tea: they changed my mind! They are even happy to make it with soy for me, as I cannot drink milk, which is such a kind accomodation- beats the constant eye rolls I get at Starbucks when I ask for that! Hands down the best value and quality for your money, and the amazing service makes it even better (if that's possible!)  In conclusion, YAY! Make sure you visit this little gem tucked away up in Heritage!"}
{"text":"I went here multiple times when I was visiting Calgary on holiday.  The coffee is pretty decent but the shop owners seemed super cold.     It's a decently cute little coffee shop but could use a friendly smile by the owners, perhaps."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre  For a local establishment I'd assume the staff to be a bit more attentive and friendly.  Will probably just go to Tim Hortins next time"}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for a good cuppa Joe.  Recently I was in the London Fog Cafe neighbourhood and so I dropped in since the reviews have been fabulous.  Took me a few turns to find it lol tucked in a strip mall by the London Drugs (yes I am directionally challenged).  The folks behind the counter were quite friendly as I ordered and babbled about everything and nothing happy to have someone other than kids to talk to.  A simple cappuccino and bakery treat were in order (I picked the peanut butter marshmallow bar).  Both were decent and the treat later shared with the kidlets with no complaints.  I liked all the cafe had to offer (lunch & breakfast items and a nice beverage selection.).  Immediately upon entering I noticed a very cozy & welcoming feel.    Looking forward to dropping in again for a bite and also to try this cafes name sake, a London Fog :)."}
{"text":"Cutest mom and pop shop and the food is so delicious! Home made soups and sandwiches that are perfect. Their cafe has that small town charm that I love."}
{"text":"This was one of the most delicious lunches I've had in a while. Beautiful homemade soup with nice sized pieces of veg and chicken, in a light cream dill broth. The triple decker sand which was nicely put together with perfectly cooked bacon and was delicious. I will definitely be back to try some of the tasty looking home baked goods and something from the drink menu. So refreshing to find great food in a friendly environment. The interior could use a little update but they have lovely paintings on the wall by Jim Pescott, who was painting a new canvas while we ate lunch! The place is fully wheelchair accessible as well."}
