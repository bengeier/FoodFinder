{"text":"Two dollar breakfast on Thursday mornings.  Went there with a few guys from work.  Its a good hole in the wall place for decent food. The guy who runs it is really friendly and approachable."}
{"text":"Lets be clear, this is a DIVE Bar.  It's small, low lit, the prices are cheap, the drinks are strong, the burgers are big, and the people are friendly.  If you are looking for a place to relax after work and get something good to eat, this is the place.  The Bacon Cheeseburger is actually smothered with real bacon (and only $5), and they offer fresh homemade onion rings.  Thursday mornings they offer the $2 special - 2 eggs, toast, bacon, and hash browns.  Don't go here if you are expecting a high-end bar or college hangout, it's a working man's (or woman's) bar.     P.S.  They offer Smut and Eggs on the weekends, so I would avoid bringing the children."}
{"text":"HELLO people this is the real deal,it is wisconsin at it'ts finest.Where else can you go and have a burger made of real meat and have a conversation with a local guy that is there,like clock work, everyday at the same time.I live in chicago,downtown in the west loop.I love Bennets.If this place was here in Chicago I would be there."}
{"text":"Went for Porn in the Morn. The most distracting breakfast I've ever had!   Food: Denver omelet was okay. The hashbrowns were a bit mushy for my liking. Omelet was decent.   You go here for the experience of eating breakfast and watching porn. You can't be in a bad mood here! Definitely worth checking out!  4 for the experience. 2 for the food."}
{"text":"Get your porn in the morn.....yep, a really fun change-up to the Saturday Morning Breakfast.    LEAVE THE KIDS AT HOME...or lock them out in the car. Bennet's serves breakfast alright, and a very eclectic collection of circa-1980s hard-core porn for your viewing pleasure while you eat some pretty damned good breakfast off a paper plate!  Yep....fun stuff.    ~ If you are easily offended...stay home.   ~ If you'd be wierded-out sitting in a bar filled with men watching hard-core porn...stay home.  (There were two other women there the morning I went, and I think we were the gender most tuned in to the entertainment!)  If you're just slightly hung-over and looking for a really good, greasy breakfast and some real eye candy (wink) then enjoy Bennet's for what it is!  FREEDOM of one man to say \"Hey, I'm going to serve food and spank in my restaurant every weekend morning!\"    God Bless America!   Go to Bennets...it's fun!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and great atmosphere for the rents and kiddos!   Reasonable prices on nearly everything."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place! Yes, they show oldies porn on the TVs on Saturday and Sunday mornings, but it's over at noon, and there is no sound (music plays). You won't find a better \"greasy spoon\" style breakfast. So much food, for little money. Yes, you have to place your order at the bar (so there isn't really table service), pay in advance, and CASH ONLY! (There is an atm on site). However, every time I've been here (which is many) they come out and clear plates and then serve you more food or drinks at the table. I love bringing people here and we've now amassed quite the group of regulars that come with us for breakfast nearly every weekend.  We love smut & eggs!"}
{"text":"Have you heard rumors about Smut and Eggs?  You know, the place in Madison that shows hard core porn on the TV's during breakfast hours on the weekends?    This is that place.    You know what?  It's not a big deal.  By 8:30AM on a Saturday this place is pretty full.  There are third shifters enjoying a beer, retirees having a bloody mary, and average folk having a cup of coffee and an omelet oblivious to the chick getting drilled on the television a few feet above their heads.  The breakfast is actually pretty good.  The omelet was very tasty and sat on a small plate covered in hash browns and toast.  The quality is below what you'd get at Denny's I will admit.  But does Denny's have naked people on a television?  I rest my case.    The rest of the day this place is a salt-of-the-Earth type bar.  Very relaxed atmosphere that makes for a good place to share a pitcher with friends and have a conversation.  There is even an RV outside where you can have a cigarette.    As for a good place to relax, meet anyone from a plumber to school board member, and have a good beer after a long day of work, this is the place.  And Smut and Eggs.  That is good too."}
{"text":"Good burgers.  Can be a rough crowd, strong mixed drinks. Price is on point!! We be back"}
{"text":"Re breakfast:  Food is pretty simple, but menu has something for everyone. Lots of bacon! And good bacon too!!  They have a Bloody Mary bar which I've seen hold basic fixings to more extensive; guess it depends on the day.  Haven't seen the mozarella cheese on a string add-in lately...they have a $2 thursday breakfast special, and opening at 6 is a large plus.  $1 burgers Monday which are good, extra 25 cents for cheese and served with chips.  Happy hour deals are great too.  Hours vary based on the evening and size of crowd, bartenders are great! They also have Golden Tee, machines, pool and darts..which occasionally are not able to be used depending on the time of day and their need for extra space."}
{"text":"If you like your eggs, hash browns and bacon with a side of 70's porn and a dash of despair, this is the place for you. It's an institution because of the novelty, not because of the food or atmosphere. So, if you keep your expectations low and your hands on the table top, you'll get through it just fine. Coffee with a shot of Kahlua helps."}
{"text":"Even without porn this is a great \"local color dive bar/restaurant\". It is what it is ,and does a great job at just that. After hearing many suggestions to do so,finally went to breakfast here, [and not on a Sunday].. Ordered #7 ,3 egg breakfast. Came with 5-6 slices of thick,delicious bacon,a generous sausage patty,hash browns and toast. Cost $6.75..Wow.. Hint;this is way too  much for one person and could easily be split..Service was good.  Suggest trying for sure!"}
{"text":"Bennett's is hard to rate.  It really depends on what you're looking for.  If you want a dive bar with the greasiest food in existence, and *awseome* 1970's porn on weekend mornings, then it rates a 5+.  If you're not into any of that, then it rates a 0.    So, taste aside, let me tell you about Bennett's.  The cooks and barstaff are quick and friendly.  The food is flavorful (and greasy), the drinks are cold, and the place is generally full of fun-spirited patrons.    There are a couple of slot machine-styled video games, an eclectic mix of hunting, fishing and americana memorabilia plastered all over the walls.    Weekend brunch is served with wall to wall porn videos and a Blood Mary bar (including string cheese with real string (made to resemble tampons)) -- yep, that's how Bennett's rolls.  The portions are generous (I recommend the Eggs Bene-dick).    Bennett Meadowood Country Club is about as far from a traditional country club as you could imagine. Still it's worth a stop to check it out for yourself.  You'll either never come back again, or you'll be tempted to become a regular."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. They used to have a location downtown that was a legend, but this lives up to the legacy.  So on weekend mornings they have cheap greasy spoon breakfast and absolutely dirty, filthy porn. Three TV's of it. And a bloody mary bar to seal the deal. Make sure you stop by after church and cleanse your soul.  One of my friends (a girl, so she doesn't know much about porn) says she will take her kids here to promote abstinence.  Anyways, just an awesome little bar - not too far out of the way- that is down to earth and lets you keep your own tab. Cash only for sure. Go during the week if you can't handle eating + obscenity."}
{"text":"How does one even begin to describe an experience like porn in the morn? Well, I'm going to give it a go.  First off, this is a bar off the beaten path. Had my husband not known of the Smut and Eggs legend, we would have never known this place exists.  Let me try and walk you through the bar: -It looks kinda shifty on the outside, and well, it is. -You walk in at 8am on a Sunday morning and realize you are the only female in the place that's not behind the bar. Or on the screens. -You order at the front, and they bring you your meal. -Avoid the blood mary, mine was barely drinkable, but I will say I was hella buzzed after drinking it. -The food is very salt of the earth, basic stuff. Bacon, eggs, bread. Nothing fancy here, but the prices also reflect that. (Think Denny's, Perkins) -Find a seat! Don't worry about the view, there are at least 7 tv's playing porn so no matter where you sit, you'll be fine. -The ladies behind the bar were super nice and friendly! Made you forget that was a girl getting creamed behind them...  Don't go here if you are A. A foodie, B. A prude, C. A single lady. It's an experience I'll never forget, but one I'll never be recreating anytime soon."}
{"text":"There are Dive BARS who possess a charming atmosphere due mostly to the regulars who frequent and a feeling of warmth and high hospitality. Bennetts McC was a horrible miss. I'm not going to write a lengthy review  but am compelled to hit on the basics of extreme horribleness and unprofessionalism. On the evening of Oct 9, my good friend and I wanted a nibble and a cocktail somewhere close in the area. My friend grew up here so she knew of this dive bar and some who worked there so I was more than excited to try it out. i could go through the detail of the place but I need to get to the point on hand. We sat at the half empty bar and were asked what we wanted to drink. The bar server never even smiled. Another tall frown faced woman approached us as we asked for menus. This woman recommended the special which she boasted she had created herself from homemade. I being a sucker for what sounded like homemade comfort food was wiling to give this a try. Before out first drinks were even half way consumed, two plates (a shared meal) were thrust in front of us. These plates held a ham slice that was thin and extremely dry. not unlike leather, canned gray string beans, an old biscuit which was a Pillsbury Grand around maybe 11 that morning, and this gummy mushy microwaved horrible bland macaroni and cheese plopped there with an \"I dare you to you to eat me\" kind of presence. Upon spying this sadness,I said aloud to my friend. \" I can't eat this\".... The tall frown face server heard this and promptly snatched the plates away from us and started arguing taking the comment very personally. she was livid angry and tried to start a fight .all cause of this so called food. At that point I paid for out two drinks as posted on the bill...(there was no food charge) and took my friend and left.  I mean wow...is that really the way you run a business? I would have gladly just ordered something else.  ( i heard their burgers are great) Very rude both servers were, highly unpredicted unprofessional behavior and NO WAY acceptable as a way to generate customers and dollars. DIVE or not."}
{"text":"Some people love this place.   We don't.   Certainly not our cup of tea if you may and others should know this before they check this place out.   When I think dive bar, Bennett's comes to mind.  It's an old establishment and many that like it is because they have gone there for years and it has sort of become a kind of Madison fixture.  We think that's fine and for people that like going there, you are most welcome to. It's kind of scuzzy, but not terrible.  The prices are fine.   Never been to Smut and Eggs and never will.  They have a good karaoke set up.    When I've been there there have always been seedy characters hanging around but never felt unsafe.  Just kind of uncomfortable.   It doesn't have a lot of room. There was nothing that was inviting about the place. The dance floor is about 20 by 20 feet.   Then there are some benches that are about 30 by 20 or even less.   Then the bar runs along the back. Peace guys.   Just calling it as I see it."}
{"text":"Yep. Its a dive bar. I was too late for breakfast. But, the fish sandwich was pretty good. Close to the bike path which is why i stopped in the first place."}
{"text":"Friday night fish is fantastic.  Home made, beer battered  cod is best I've ever had.  Lite and perfectly seasoned and prepared.   Billy   Just stopped by for Taco Tuesday.  Gormet tacos...delicious."}
{"text":"At first I wasn't sure how to rate this bar.  4 stars cause it absolutely succeeds at being as advertised?  2 stars cause it's actually a real dive?  Clearly I made my choice.  Ladies, as much as I hate to say it, bring a friend (another lady will work well!). It'll save you time fighting off the hordes of super creepy old guys.   Anyhow, amusing dive bar decor in an overall smallish place. Some gambling games against one wall. They have a halfway decent bar with wonderfully bad diner food (and I mean that in the best of ways). Which brings me to the actual reason you should check this place out.  Porn in the Morn. (Formally Smut and Eggs I think.)  Weekend mornings they have Porn in the Morn. Best hangover cure ever. They have greasy breakfast, bloody mary bar, plenty of other booze for people who don't like those, and every single TV in the place is playing porn. It usually seems to be of the fantastically hilarious 70s and 80s porn (gotta love those staches!) Simply put, a great place to go out with a (smaller) group of friends after a night of partying!!  Eep! Almost forgot! Cash only!"}
{"text":"Here's what the place has going for it: decent bar food and cheap.  Here's the negative: We think we're pretty open people, so porn isn't a big deal.  However it was on every TV in the place.  Guess that's part of the novelty, but having sports on a few TVs would be nice.  Especially on a Sunday morning.  The service was awful.  We waited & then started waving at the servers to try to get their attention just to get a coffee. The servers were pros at not making eye contact. Ordering food was quick, but waited almost an hour to get the food.  We were on the verge of cutting our losses (we had to prepay) when we saw what we were hoping was or food. If the service had been better (more friendly) this would be a different review."}
{"text":"Great burgers and cold beer.  The specials are always good. You will not leave hungry. Breakfast on Saturdays and Sundays is generous and inexpensive. Don't take kids on weekend mornings though, they may not enjoy it lol!"}
{"text":"i tell everyone about this place. it TRULY is the stuff legends are made of. SmutMuffin? EggsBenaDick? yea...they've got that piece! ok, seriously... Porn Breakfast pardon me...is there anything better? if so, please...enlighten me. everyone needs to go here at least once in their life."}
{"text":"The breakfast was sooooo awesome- compared to what I thought it might be.  Quite reasonablly priced too! Atmosphere is contagious with fun, liked the bartenders shirt that said \" I don't need sex\" then on the back \" the government screws me everyday\" & tasty Bloody Mary w/ bar 4 the fixins & the shows were decent &  tasteful I thought  ;)~"}
{"text":"Like the place; definite dive bar, but breakfast and service are very good. Interesting atmosphere on sat/sun mornings for porn in the morn....you really get desensitized to the porn after the third time or so that you attend one of those events. A lot of hardcore gambling machine players too if you're into that sort of thing.... The machines get a lot of mileage.  Only thing I don't like about this place is the bathrooms...they don't necessarily smell awful but you can smell \"old, but cleanish bathroom\" scent in roughly a quarter of the bar. ventilation in those bathrooms needs to be redone."}
