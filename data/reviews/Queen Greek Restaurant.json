{"text":"Food is fresh & great! One of the best Greek restaurants my husband and I have had since moving to AZ three months ago.  We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Fast and delicious. One of our regular take out places. Everyone in the family loves their baba ganoush, including our toddler, so we usually get two orders (and finish both :). Then for the main course we rotate between their chicken and steak dishes (shawarma or kebabs). Wanted to try the Philly last time but it was sold out, must be good!!!

We have never had a bad meal here. Food is yummy and you can't beat the price! Highly recommended!

Forgot to mention: the only thing that is slightly off about this place is that one of their sauces is pink. Tzatziki maybe? We never figured it out"}
{"text":"I usually don't right reviews, but I felt like I have to for this restaurant. IT'S AMAZING!!! I have tried the steak shawarma, chicken kebab, and the vageterian falafel plate. They are all delicious! The place is very clean and the people that work there are very friendly. Every time I go there, or since I go there almost every week they give discount and sometimes free desserts. Thank you Queen Greek!!:)"}
{"text":"I had the #1 gyro. Messy and full of flavor. Guy at counter seemed to care about customers. Brought food out instead if calling from the counter. Then went and grabbed some napkins for me which were needed. I'll be returning to get my gyro fix."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and very authentic! Great customer service, price is great and very clean. I love the food and definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Tried a few gyro plates and the baklava. The pita and saffron rice was ok but the sauces and lamb meat was definitely subpar. Tasted like they forgot a few ingredients in the tzatziki and the bhaba ghanoush (forgot how to spell). Doubt we will be back, plenty of better Greek options around"}
{"text":"The staff is awesome. The food is always cooked fresh to order. The location is convenient. The food is also delicious. Dinner or lunch this place rocks. Def a go to at least once a month."}
{"text":"Tried this spot for the first time today and I would have to say I would defiantly come back. My husband ordered the gyro and I had their chicken shawarma. The food was warm and flavorful, delicious!"}
{"text":"I recommend eveyone to eat at queen greek. The food is amazing and the prices are great...I went there with the family and everyone loved it...I had the cyro and the rice...my wife and my kids had the kebab and falafel...the place is really nice and clean. The staff are very friendly and the owner is too generous...he gave us a discount.  Sense then we being going there couple of times a week...guys check out this family owned restaurant and I promise you won't regret it. It's the family's new favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"The slowest service imaginable. 36 minutes and they can't even produce an appetizer? I grew to my chair."}
{"text":"It was close to closing time on Easter Sunday, so we ordered our food to go. We ordered gyros,falafel A couple of salads, and some rice.
The gyro meat was dry and peppery. Salad greens were ok but the dressing, the babbaganouch, and the tsatsiki were way off. Falafel was ordinary, just OK.
Fortunately, we were not given the bums rush because it was late. The staff we dealt with were very nice. I have no idea how this restaurant got such a high rating on yelp, because we were very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. I've had gyros and pitas at bigger chain Greek places and they can't compete with this local fast food restaurant. The chicken schwarma is packed with chicken that's marinated just right. All their sandwiches offer huge servings. They're not stingy with their meat. Two people can eat for $15 or less! We definitely eat here a lot and you can place an order through Yelp."}
{"text":"This has quickly become my favorite lunch go to spot. Not only that but my 6 yr old likes the food too. Even tried the baklava. Always great service and serving sizes are perfect."}
{"text":"I ordered the Steak Shawarma today and it was delicious; perfectly cooked and seasoned. The service was fast and everyone was beyond helpful. I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Tried the gyro with pita, absolutely love it. I like how the meat was tender and delicious, will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"Really good tasting food. Courtesy free soup appetizers for everyone. Excellent service. Have been here 3 times now."}
{"text":"Had the gyro plate and you definitely won't have to eat for a few days after because it is a lot of food! I love greek food and am glad that there is another quality place around to get my greek fix."}
{"text":"I called in an order for pickup 20 minutes before they closed & everything was so good & fairly priced. I ordered the Dolma appetizer, Spanakopita, & Baklava. Their Baklava was perfect, flaky, & not too sweet- which is how I like it! The man who helped me was so sweet, accommodating & handsome. He threw in some free lentil soup for me to try which was actually my favorite part of the meal I ordered. Def recommend this place, & will prob go get some more Dolma & try the Gyro plate today."}
{"text":"Incredibally good middle eastern food from hummus, to rice, to fresh pitas, to chicken, to gyros, and baklava. Make sure you check this place out....and come hungry!"}
{"text":"I was planning to try Queen Greek because I love Greek Food. 
 I was in the area after having dinner someplace else and decided to try one of my favorites for takeout.  Asked for Spanakopita (spinach pie).  

It was two pieces for $2.75 which I thought was really cheap.  I came home and put it in fridge.  The next day I took it out of the styrofoam package and saw how small and greasy they were.  My fingers were soaked in grease.  I wrapped up these mini-pies in paper towels, then microwaved them.  The towel was soaked.  Then I put another clean towel around it and microwaved for a few more seconds and another towel soaked.  So I don't know what I can say.  The pies were inedible from the grease.  I think that once they bake them and somebody asks for an order, they fried them in the deep fryer.  That's the only thing that can possibly get these spinach pies totally soaked in grease.  
Can't find myself going there to try their other food despite all the four star reviews."}
{"text":"Wow really good! 10% discount for GD employees. Ordered the #1 Gyro combo and the meat is tender, not dry, seasoned perfectly. Loved it! Maybe even gives George down the street a run for his money!"}
{"text":"small family run business that provides a quality product and flavor for The ethnic eating experience"}
{"text":"Happy to see they did an update and expansion of their restaurant, looks GREAT! Still the best gyros, and chicken and gyro salads around."}
{"text":"Awesome service with delicious food and great portions. You difinetly won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek food. I usually get the chicken kebab pita sandwich.  Chicken is flavorful and tender.  Huge portions. About $9 bucks for the combo meal. Owners are very friendly too."}
{"text":"I had the chance to eat here a few days ago and I would defiantly say this is one of the best Greek places I've eaten at here in Phoenix. The meal was huge, delicious, and very reasonably priced. The meat was fantastic. I'll be coming back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today. Decided on Pita wraps. We had a Beef Shawarma and an Italian beef, with onion rings and Spanakopita. All of it was very good except for the Italian beef. It was way too salty and even worse dipped in the Au Jus. Looking forward to trying more things from this place."}
{"text":"The worst falafel I EVER had!! While the staff was nice, the falafel is simply disgusting. It tastes exactly like the instant falafel packets you can get at the grocery store... so nasty. My friend got the same thing and agreed. It didn't even look like a round falafel, it was all mashed up and deformed. I will never return here again."}
{"text":"Closed their doors early on me 10 minutes before their closing time.  Even though theirs hours are clearly stated as 7pm online.  Also, their website is down... such a shame I really like their food but clearly customer service is not their number one priority. If they want to go home early on Sundays maybe they should just change their hours to 6:30."}
{"text":"This place is either hit or miss. Today my hubby and I ordered some lunch and we received it missing a salad. Overall the food quality was not as strong as their competitors who unfortunately are closed on sundays. Needless to say we will not be returning as the number of bad experiences outweigh the good ones by far :("}
{"text":"Everyone must eat here, the food is absolutely delicious! We had a bit of everything, to highlight the falafel was the best I've ever had. Everything we ate you can taste that is all homemade. The baklava again the best I've ever had. My 6yr old daughter said the hummus was the best she's had!My son got the grilled chicken and it was not your ordinary chicken it had a very unique flavor. Just go eat there and enjoy for yourself!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to try out Queen Greek as I noticed the restaurant was located in the strip mall that I pass by on my daily commute. I'm so glad that I decided to give this restaurant a try as the food is absolutely amazing! There are a handful of Greek restaurants in the area and this one is by far my favorite. I really liked the Chicken Shawarma as the portions were great, food was extremely tasty from start to finish, and the prices are very reasonable for what is offered. I also tried their gyros which are very good as well. The food does a while to prepare so keep that in mind, however the wait is most definitely worth it!

I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for Greek food. As for me, I plan to come back here every now and then as the food is really great."}
{"text":"Nice place, very clean, today's visit was for a late lunch and they were still doing brisk takeout and a few parties sitting at the tables.  I had the Kefta Kebab Plate which included two large Kebabs, a pita, lots of flavorful rice and a salad with plenty of feta and a great dressing, can't determine the type or what spices it contained but the dressing was good."}
{"text":"Super good food. Very friendly owners. Gyro was huge. Meat was tender. And baklava was something to write home about! I'll be back definitely"}
{"text":"I eat here frequently, as it is near my work.  Everything I have tried has been tasty, and the chicken salad is my favorite.  I also like the fries, but agree with another reviewer that the french fry portion is pretty large, so bring a friend and share."}
{"text":"First time reviewer- ordered Pork Shwarma and Baba Ganouj for pick-up at a 6:00 PM. It was ready and waiting for me.  Smelled fantastic and couldn't wait to taste it when I got home.  Pork shwarma came with a Greek salad (fresh, great dressing) and the Baba Ganouj was wonderful with a slightly smokey flavor.  Probably from grilling the eggplant.  I would definitely go back and try something else.  Don't expect great decor, but great service and great food awaits you!"}
{"text":"We are so glad we decided to try this nice place!  The food was absolutely delicious and the owner was just as wonderful. The food was hot and fresh and the restaurant was clean and inviting.   The owner treated us to some baklava which happens to be my favorite dessert and this baklava was by far the best I have ever had!  The Greek salad was so fresh.  We cannot wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is friendly, genuine and very eager to please every customer. It's a small spot with just a few tables, but every time we stop in for a quick (delicious) dinner we feel right at home. The food is exceptional. Made fresh to order, and always impeccably prepared. My favorites are the chicken kebab platter-- love the seasonings and juiciness of the chicken, and the rice is fantastic, too-- and the classic Greek salad. Generous helping of feta, and a homemade dressing that knocks my socks off. Make sure you try the pink garlic sauce for the pita bread... I find myself craving that alone on a regular basis. 
So good to have a solid Greek restaurant right around the corner."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and was impressed with both the nice people running this restaurant and the cleanliness.  Of course the food was good too!  I had the Chicken Kebab Sandwich which had excellent flavor and tenderness.  The flavors were spot on; however, they do add a lot of feta cheese, which to me overpowered the flavor of tzatziki.  Don't get me wrong, they are doing it right, I would just order Less feta, as a little goes a long way for me.  I will definetely be back to try soem of their plate dinners!

Go check them out: Hayden / McDowell Southeast side"}
{"text":"Gabi M nailed it. I want to give them 5 stars though, because I really want them to do well. 

This place is walking distance from my office, and I go here pretty regularly. It's really good Greek take out, but I wouldn't travel to get here. It is a way better option than the Subway next door, or any place within a 5 minute drive.

The owners and staff are really nice folks as well."}
{"text":"Queen Greek opened up last year sometime and each time I go back, it's better than the last. They're always adding options and improving. Last time I went, they'd redesigned the dining room and redecorated- looks great!  

I usually get gyro pitas, falafel, hummus, tabbouleh and all are yummy!!"}
{"text":"I was in today and thought it was OK.  The place is new and clean.  The menu is posted above the register with pictures which is helpful.

I had the #5 combo which is beef steak kabob in a pita with fries and a drink for $8.90 plus tax.  There was a decent amount of meat and the sauce was pretty good.  The fries were hot but soggy and not crisp the way I like my fries.

Overall this place is worth a try if you're in the area and looking for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Queen Greek is definitely doing something right based on all of the five star reviews they've got to date... I agree that this place is A-OK, but five star worthy?  I don't think so.

I recently stopped by and ordered a Greek Salad with chicken to go... it hit the spot, but there wasn't anything about it that stood out as super tasty.  

The food is good, portions are large, and prices are moderate, but again, there is nothing outstanding here that will make me rush back.

If you find yourself nearby and in the mood from Greek food in a casual environment or to \"take out,\" this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"Large choice., price were affordable. perfect for lunch or diner. Close at 8:00 for the week days"}
{"text":"Could use some help, Greek salad had to much vinegar leaving plate with to much liquid on it and salad very vinegary. The salad had no olive oil on it or seasoning witch is what balances out the acidity of the vinegar.  Also if your going to make a Greek salad, add Greek dressing.  It's not a Greek salad just because you put olives & feta cheese on it.  Partner had The chicken swarma with hummus and said it was to sweet."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I would definitely recommend them! The servings were huge in my opinion and the food came out hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"Falafel & gyro plates were huge! Fries were hot & fresh.  The place is super clean.  Staff is very friendly. There's an entrance facing Hayden & one facing the back offices. Happily close to home so keeping telephone number on speed dial to pick up on the way home."}
{"text":"I've been here four times, and each time was as mediocre as the rest. The gyros are kind of sloppy and nothing special. Today I had falafel and it tasted exactly like the boxed falafel mix you can get at any grocery store. Its a nice family owned place and you can tell they're definitely trying their best, but they have a little way to go. Since this place is very close to my house, I'll keep coming in. I'd like to see them succeed."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much, but it's a little diamond in the rough. The service is great. You can tell its family owned with the same couple people in there, and so excited to talk with you about recommendations and what goes well with what. I've had the lamb gyro, chicken gyro, grape leaves, and hummus- all delicious. The side salads don't disappoint and have been fresh and crisp every time."}
{"text":"The food is awesome.. I ordered #22 chicken steak  rice, pita bread and salad.  The meat is so tender..
There is enough food for 2 people  or for me for two meals.  The people are very pleasant, friendly and hospitable. It's a breath of fresh air in today's society where a lot of millenniums are working and don't value their jobs. These people are warm and welcoming and you can tell they appreciate your business.."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed a Sunday lunch here. The food was excellent ! My only recommendation would be to have some background music playing...perhaps Greek?"}
{"text":"good quality gyros, but kinda flat in the flavor - the meat should be spicier; and the tzatziki sauce was really disappointing - needs more dill and more garlic.
great fries though and the pita bread was very good quality.  Nice people too.
I'll try it again"}
{"text":"Love this place. Eat here at least once a week. Gyros are amazing, always get just the basic gyro and it's always delicious!"}
{"text":"This is the best Greek food I have had in Phoenix and by a pretty decent margin. Go to is the pork souvlaki pita.

It's not in the most noticeable location and I think their business suffers a bit for it but man is it good."}
{"text":"Came here with a Groupon. So the two of us ate for $10 plus. I had a gyro, friend had the chicken gyro. It was pretty standard. I like more green on my gyro but I won't complain. The service was fast and courteous, table was clean. If you have an aching for a gyro, this will fill that void. No frills."}
{"text":"We discovered this place a few months ago and have gone several times. Great food, great prices, super friendly service. (Omg- I could put their delicious garlic sauce on anything) We've eaten in each time and noticed they do a lot of take out business.  It's the perfect spot for those nights you don't feel like cooking- and their servings are huge so you'll probably have enough leftovers to cover lunch the next day too :)"}
{"text":"I work evenings in an office building near this restaurant and I am occasionally in the mood to try something new for take out at dinner time. One of my co-workers suggested I give them a try and I was both pleased and satisfied with the experience.

I ordered the Souvlaki Pita Wrap Combo, which consisted of sliced and marinated pork loin layered on pita bread with their special garlic sauce, fries, and a soft drink.

The portions size was very good, the pork was succulent, and all of the flavors worked well together and were not overpowered by the garlic sauce.

Friendly service, reasonable prices and wait time.
I will most certainly be adding this restaurant to my regular dinnertime take out circuit."}
{"text":"To start, they seem like they have a steady flow of customers.  Though.. I waited 30 minutes for my food.. not sure if I went on a bad day but was disappointing. 

The food though was pretty ok. I got a hummus plate. The gyro meat seemed tad burnt on the sides.. it was crunchy somewhat but soft the same time. The pita bread was kind of hard and not soft. The hummus was different as it had a tang to it. The tzatziki sauce was watery and somewhat bland. 

So the place was okay... just the wait time was terrible. I should order ahead for pick up rather than wait there for my food."}
{"text":"Once a month my husband and I do take out from this place when we're both tired and don't want to cook after a long day at work. Great gyros at a great price what more can you ask for!"}
{"text":"I was excited when I saw this place moving in. There's not a whole lot of Greek options anywhere remotely close to this area (I live about a 1/2 mile from Queen Greek), and based on my one visit I like what I tasted.

It's small, and seems to cater more to take-out than dining in. I picked up an order early Saturday evening and chairs were already stacked on top of tables (nobody was dining in). There was only one guy working (I'm guessing he was the same guy that took my order over the phone) and he was very friendly. 

I ordered a gyro plate w/rice (and it came w/a Greek salad). Everything tasted really good. I was actually pretty impressed w/the side salad. Usually w/these types of plates the side salad is just an afterthought, but this one was pretty good size and had lots of goodies on it. Gyro meat was good as well. I mean, I wouldn't proclaim it to be the absolute best gyro meat I've ever eaten, but it was tasty. I will point out, I ordered fries and was accidently give rice, but it was fine. The plates also come w/pita if you want to make a sandwich. The pita is really good! My group also ordered spanakopita & hummus (both of which were good). I tasted chicken or pork loin from people I ordered with, and thought both meats were delicious and tender. The pork loin was particularly tasty. 

The prices here are reasonable (most plates are around $10 and they give you quite a bit...I had enough for two meals). My sister ordered the pork loin sandwich, which I thought was pretty decent size for $6. 

I'm glad there's a Greek option in this area now & I hope to take advantage of it."}
{"text":"If King of Gyros and Queen Greek had a kid, would it be the Prince of Pita?

Anyways, Queen Greek offers all your favorite Greek/Mediterranean dishes such as shawarma, gyros, and falafel. You can order a la carte or as a combo, which includes a drink and fries. I browsed through the menu before deciding on the chicken kabob pita combination with garlic sauce (The other sauce option was tzatziki). 

The meal only took a short time to be made and the pita was a huge portion of layered seasoned chicken breast, romaine lettuce, tomato, onion, and garlic sauce. All the components tasted great together, although the chicken was very slightly overcooked. The fries were a hefty portion as well. They were lightly crisp and went well with the pita. I could only finish a portion of them though because they gave me such a large amount to eat through.

The one thing that annoyed me the most was that the pita was very hard to eat without all the contents spilling left and right. As I ate the pita, the fillings fell:

Onto my shirt which made a large orange stain on it,
Onto the table,
Onto the plate,
Onto the floor.

I did the best I could to clean up the saucy mess I made. I do appreciate all the generous portions but if you have to go to work right afterwards this might not be the best option for you since it's a messy eating experience and your clothes will smell like fried food (At least mine did).

The meal itself was a little less than $10. I'll be back if I'm craving a pita in this area, but on a day when I'm not working!"}
{"text":"The gyro was good sized and fries crispy were crispy the way I ordered them. The Tzatziki tasted more like ranch dressing than yogurt with dill or herbs.  KInd of a deal-killer.

Might check the shwarma or steak wraps"}
{"text":"This place is nice, the service was great, I came in two minutes after closing and they still fed me well. The food was spot on. I'll be a regular here the next ten days I'm in town and when I come back every year."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious food and great service. This is a family owned, local business that I am so glad is part of our community. They've catered many events I've coordinated and have done a wonderful job.  Love this place, and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Came in for a gyro side George's is closed on Sundays.  Not quite as good as George's, but still very tasty.  Fries were delicious. I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Amazing and delicious food. The best gyro on all of Phoenix.  Great service. They were so amicable and gracious.  Please please come and enjoy the food. 
12 stars"}
{"text":"Very good food. Very nice people. Great service. What more could you want? Food portions are plentiful and inexpensive. A server brought me a cup of lentil soup which I had never had before and it was delicious. I asked about ketchup and instead of pointing to the corner the gentleman that brought out my food went and grabbed me some ketchup. Exemplary all the way around."}
{"text":"This food is crazy good! Everything was amazing! Don't miss the opportunity to taste the incredible homemade breads either!

Beyond the food itself, the family has an amazing story of how they came to the US and through hard work and perseverance, we get to enjoy their delicious creations!

And don't forget the baklava!"}
{"text":"The staff is great and food is delicious! There's a reason why the girl and I visit this place at least 1-2 times a week."}
{"text":"I just ate at Queen Greek for the first time and will definitely be back! I had the chicken kebab gyro and it was amazing. The ingredients are super fresh. I saw the owner cooking my food in their sparkling clean kitchen, which is great to see. I would highly recommend anyone to try this place. The best in Scottsdale for sure!"}
{"text":"Great little shop, food was fantastic and portions were huge.  Owner is really nice.  Exceptional rice and Greek salad."}
{"text":"Ok food, abysmal service. Me and a friend came in, separate orders with groupons, and only one was allowed to order food. Will not return again."}
{"text":"They have been open about a month and I have already been here several times. What I love most about this little place is that they make everything from scratch and you they have a wide variety on the menu! Also the prices and portions are great( a huge gyro, a drink and fries all for 8$). Each time I come, the food is great, especially Greek chicken salad. Its very fresh, packed full of flavor and veggies and a ton of meat. I would highly recommend this family run gem."}
{"text":"This place is hidden, nestled between a subway and a thai restaurant off the beaten path. 

I ordered the Gyro plate and it was good. It came with pita, the gyro meat, fries AND a side salad. It was a lot of food. 

My boyfriend got a philly cheesesteak and he liked it. 

The ambiance is mediocre at best. it was DESOLATE and empty at 7pm on a friday night which typically isn't the best sign, but I ordered ahead for pick up so there was no turning back. The food was pretty good but nothing I would write home about."}
{"text":"I like this place, the gyro meat is good although a little salty. The hummus and baba ganoosh are good! It is a good value and very fresh."}
{"text":"The food tastes homemade and is fresh to order. Would definitely recommend! The Pork Souvlaki and the Chicken Shawarma are both tasty as well as the Gyro Pita"}
{"text":"Awesome classic gyro combo. I get carry out regularly, it's ready in 5 minutes everytime. Fries are cooked perfectly. No complaints."}
{"text":"Went around 245 pm on a friday and 2 people eating in.. Service  for me wasn't the quickest but adequate. My Gyros was just okay...why? cuz fries were cooked in oldish oil and the veggies and sauce in my pita was not evenly distributed (tomatoes and red onions on one side and not other). Service was totally average...no hello, no smile, no welcome...but it was made quickly...got my drink, walked out to get my car from back and by the time I drove around to front and, walked in, it was done. No extra sauce given for gyros or fries like other places I've been to. At least there is Greek food in this area. Dude isn't Greek; not that it matters a whole bunch. However, it's like when I order Cantonese Chinese food I usually expect a Cantonese chief...no biggie."}
{"text":"I've been back multiple times since my first review. The quality hasn't changed and neither has the service. Wonderful food and great folks behind the counter. I highly recommend Queen Greek for dine-in or take-out. Stop in and grab some amazing grub. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Came in the other day with my sister, and we had a great time.
There was a woman in a scooter ahead of us, and not gonna lie, she was a difficult customer. She couldn't hear to well, seemed confused and a little snippy. The man on register was super nice, he slowly walked her through everything (not in a patronizing or annoyed way) and while she was deciding took our order and was personable. When she finished paying he even moves aside chairs from a table so she could eat her food.
We got the chicken gyro, the pork souvlaki, and the appetizer, which were all super amazing. They have a great sauce. He offered us a discount (I think bc the woman had taken so long). Then before we left he gave us a complimentary baklava piece. The baklava was perfect.
Most definitely coming back.
Great experience."}
{"text":"This place is delicious !!!!!!!! First time here and service was incredible! The girl at the front was so sweet and nice and very helpful with recommendations. We ordered #22 which was a two item combo meal. Chicken kabob and gyro were both flavorful and fresh! Rice, salad and pita came with and was all delicious. They give you this pink sauce, not sure what's in it but it is insanely delicious!!!!! Will come here again soon. They deliver and are on all the eats apps. The restaurant was empty so I don't think a lot of people know about this place. Truly a hidden gem! I think it's better than most Greek restaurants around the valley. My top choice has always been Mika's Greek but I think the food here is much better."}
{"text":"This is my second time trying Greek cuisine. This place is located in an area where there isn't much going on. The outside of the restaurant is covered in photos of the food that they serve, which is very helpful. The staff is friendly. Clean and neat environment. I had the #6 steak combo. My coworker has the kefta combo plate with rice. I'd have to say the kefta meat was really good! The kefta marinate was different from the #6 steak."}
