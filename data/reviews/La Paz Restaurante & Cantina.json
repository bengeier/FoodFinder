{"text":"Ok let me prefect the fact that I never write reviews on yelp.  I also am the most sympathetic individual to restaurants due to the amount of time I spent working for wonderful establishments throughout my service career.    My colleague and I walk into LaPaz, and there is probably 5 people in the restaurant, but it takes 5 minutes to even see a worker (who quickly looks away as she doesn't want to have to deal with us), and then another 2 minutes to be greeted.   We seat and a few minutes later, and are greeted by our server. We try and order guacamole (avocado, pico, and onion) only to be told the food preparer came in late and that would not be available.  When To  we tried to order... Tamales too would not be available.  The only two things I ever get here would not be available.   My colleague went to the men's bathroom and there were no towels, typically one could deal with a lack of towels, given the high end hand dryer.... This didn't work either.  Icing on the cake.    I hate when reviewers go on rants, and I just can't relate. So take this with a grain of salt.  My colleague and myself live for a good restaurant, and we used to love this place.  It used to be amazing, even after they moved from south blvd.  At this point I am exceedingly disappointed, probably will not be back.  The only difference between LaPaz and Taco Bell is warm tequila at best."}
{"text":"What is up with this place?   I have been going to La Paz since it was in its first location, even before it was on South Blvd.  It really has gone downhill.  I keep giving it a chance, because it has always been my go to Mexican Resturant choice.  They have amazing queso.  The last 5 times that I have tried to give this place a chance it has been out of whatever I want to order, their machines are broken and once the whole kitchen was closed.  There is never more than two parties in the place and the service is extremely slow.  One server is so timid he acts like he is afraid to approach the table to take your order.  When you ask him any questions he acts like he is clueless to whatever you are saying.  I may give it one more chance, but doubtful.  Clearly the management doesn't care!"}
{"text":"I can confidently say that I will never go here again.  To be fair, I went to La Paz for dinner with a group of 30.  Nonetheless, this was an event planned well in advance that the restaurant was aware of.  So one would think that they would be prepared with the proper waitstaff to handle this size of a party.  But they clearly were not.  Dinner took at least 45-60 minutes to come out.  The food runners and waiters were not able to distinguish between entrees, so figuring out who ordered what and what each plate even had on it delayed the meal even further.  Our waitress repeatedly came by asking, \"Can I get you anything?\"  when every water glass at the table was empty.  I will say that their chips are very good.  But this is the only Mexican restaurant I have ever been to that refilled the chip basket once then let the empty basket sit there for over an hour.  The blended margarita was passable.  The taco salad with grilled chicken was underwhelming.  Where the heck were the beans and rice?  My boyfriend's Street Pork Tacos tasted like what dog food smells like."}
{"text":"Meh.  Sure to please the gringos looking for bland Americanized McMexican fare.   A couple extra touches would help, like warming up the chips. I didn't try the drinks, so no comment there. Location and atmosphere are nice."}
{"text":"Just 'okay' is the word that comes to this restaurant.  I tried it for the third time over the weekend and I told my neighbor that I would never go back. Lacking spice and just good food overall. The service isn't stellar either.  If you're looking for good Mexican in Charlotte you're better of heading to Don Pedros."}
{"text":"This restaurant is okay; it's just not great. Regarding the decor, I like the TVs in the bar area. But overall, the place doesn't seem as warm and welcoming as I like. Maybe it's the high ceilings. Even with the big furniture, the place still feels a little empty. Maybe it needs more pictures on the wall or a different color scheme?   The food was good, but not great. The chips and salsa were pretty standard. My friend requested salsa verde, which looked more like guacamole than salsa. It didn't taste bad, but the consistency was unexpected. We asked the waiter about it and he acknowledged that sometimes it's prepared differently depending on who's working in the kitchen.   I ordered a fajita combo; I chose the portobello with spinach and the shrimp. I also ordered a traditional margarita on the rocks with a salt rim.  The drink was average. I finished it, but I wouldn't order it again.  My fajita was good. But I'm not sure it was worth the price.  My bill was $30 for a fajita and margarita.   I would give this place 2 and a half stars if I could. Its in a good location (I love the metropolitan).  The food was good, but it's not a good value. I wasn't impressed with the decor. I doubt that I'll return. There are so many other Mexican restaurants in CLT that are better."}
{"text":"Had a lovely night at the new La Paz. So excited to have it back! Although with any new restaurant you can tell they have some problems to work out as any new place it appears the management is eager to get feedback and they were open to opinions. The food was so good, salsa was like old times only fresher. I had margaritas and was pleased with them also. It is a bit noisy but I am sure that will be addressed due to the high ceilings .  Seems to be busy and I am sure as time goes on it will only get better .  La Paz is a part of Charlotte's history, lots of memories and more to come"}
{"text":"I remember La Paz being located off of South Blvd for years and we would go there all the time. Now they have relocated towards uptown in the Metropolitan area. What can I say, absolutely  love it!! Amazing food, atmosphere, and MARGARITAS are the best in Charlotte. Hands down La Paz makes the best margarita to man. I have tried the pomegranate. skinny, the original, and the original with mango. The pomegranate is my favorite, but it is a bit pricey for a drink. If your looking for a margarita that goes down light and taste yummy, I recommend the skinny margarita. It's affordable and fantasticly made. The bartenders are on point with their drinks. I have eaten almost everything on the menu and the food is all Amazing. I have never had a bad experience at La Paz. The staff is friendly, the atmosphere is inviting, and the food is awesome. Right when you sit down they bring you chips, and 2 different kinds of salsa (red and green base). We always order the queso. It's a bit spicy, but it melts in your mouth the bomb. The decor is brightly lit and they have a patio which is nice to sit at. Sometimes a band is playing outside as well. My boyfriend and I are huge cantina eaters and we go to La Paz on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Terrible staff, manager was a really creepy guy. Food was worse than taco bell, go to Paco's Tacos or Cantina."}
{"text":"At La Paz, I was so ready for some fresh Mexican food with interesting flavors.  What I got was generous portions of stuff that mostly tasted like it came out of a can or a freezer with perhaps a quick pass through a microwave.  Yuck.  No bright, bold favors, with the exception of the smoky salsa, which was interesting.  Just blandness, flavorlessness, and dried-out or mushy textures.  Way below-average food quality was saved from one star by the apparent cleanliness and décor newness.  It was about 5:30 p.m. on Friday, the day after the 2013 Fourth of July.  I took my elderly mom out for a rare restaurant dinner.  When we arrived, the restaurant was almost deserted--always a bad sign!  Because of mom's wheelchair, we were seated in the huge third room that was made up entirely of tables with hard, echo-y surfaces everywhere.  The room cried out for a little fabric or something soft to make it cozier and more inviting; this had the ambiance of a cold, whistling airport waiting area.    We were alone in there, except for the two people at an appealing-looking outside table who were soon forced in by a rainstorm.  It took them three trips to empty their table themselves and decamp to the inside--with zero help from the not-to-be-found wait staff. We felt pretty neglected, too.  They never did fully set up our table -- I finally got up and commandeered some salt and pepper from another table about 3/4 of the way through the dinner.   The relatively short, plastic-coated menu had some appealing-sounding entries that had us psyched -- char-grilled chicken with mango salsa, coconut rice, and black beans, for example.  I was also intrigued by the Mexican Flag enchiladas, which were supposed to be three types of enchiladas covered in three different sauces representing the colors of the Mexican flag.  Yum, right?  Uh, no.  When the food first arrived after a reasonable but longer-than-we-expected wait, mom tried to send it all back.  She was right, but I intervened and we listlessly ate it all.  As I write this, my tummy feels like it is loaded with lead.  Ugh....  First, the coconut rice had been replaced with a truly awful-tasting, mushy excuse for Spanish rice.  \"Where is the coconut rice?  Coconut rice is the reason we ordered this dish,\" we said.   \"Oh, we are out of coconut rice,\" the waitress explained without apology.   We think substituting food without asking us first is a major no-no.  Then, the food on both plates didn't look good.  The bite of chicken mom tasted was hard to chew, and she said it tasted miserable.  I thought it was okay but flavorless.  It was one of those massive chicken breasts that had been portion-reduced by horizontally slicing (not pounding) the chicken to make a thin piece with a huge footprint.  There was maybe a teaspoonful of presumably-bottled mango salsa that was amazingly flavorless on the obviously-not-marinated, flavorless chicken.    The refried beans were heaped in a stiff vertical stack at least three inches tall and visually similar to the cliffs of Dover, with that fresh-from-the-can flavor.  At least the tea tasted good, and there were some tasty bits of steak in the enchiladas.    Alas, the enchiladas sat too long under heat lamps before service.The enchiladas may once have had sauce on them, but once served, no sauce remained at all-- just a bit of dried coloration on top.  Above that was a thin layer of dried-out cheese--cheddar(?) on one and white cheese on the other two.  The Mexican flag idea was completely lost.  We ordered little dishes of the missing sauces and poured some velveeta-like melted cheese over top of the rice to make it edible and soldiered on.  A $15 Mexican entree should be vastly better than this.  With tip, our check exceeded $40 (no drinks other than tea, no appetizers, and no dessert) - an amount that should have allowed us to eat pretty well at many much better restaurants.  Mom and I will not be back to La Paz."}
{"text":"Seriously horrible experience here, took over an hour to sit us and the restaurant wasn't even busy. After an hour we asked the same hostess how much longer it would be and it was as if she forgot we were standing there (even though we were the only people waiting).  On top of that we heard the couple eating behind us complaining that it had been an hour since they ordered and they wanted to cancel the order.  We ordered our beers and 20 minutes later we got them and they were warm so we decided at that point not to even try the food, we didn't want a nice quick dinner to turn in to a long drawn out thing.    Never going back. Pisces and Vivace next door are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this over priced, poorly located tex/mex. Very mediocre food and the service is very bare. The salsa is really good but the rest of the meal was forgettable. Go elsewhere for your Mexican fix."}
{"text":"It took 25 minutes to get warm 3/4 full beers and watered down shots of tequila. Table of three next to us got one dinner while other two waited on their food.  We asked for our check before ordering food and quickly hit the road. Never going back."}
{"text":"Yummy Jumbo Margarita, at an enormous price $18--Ouch.  You know a Mexican or Tex/Mex restaurant stinks when they trot out chilie rellenos that look like overgrown pepper poppers from Denny's.  Just lousy.  The black bean soup that came after I finished dinner was bland and watery.  Looked like the water they boiled the black beans and forgot to throw out.  The chips and sala were okay and plentiful.  The waitress was pleasant, if average. The place was nicely decorated, albeit almost empty on a Wednesday night.  Still searching for tolerable Mexican food in Charlotte.  Do not waste your time here as it will be following its sister restaurant toward doom."}
{"text":"We waited 35 minutes before our drinks arrived! That is beyond ridiculous. Food was good."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews unless I'm extremely impressed or unsatisfied with my experience. This so happens to be one of those times.  I have been here one other time before today - in that particular instance the food was great and the service was just ok. No issues and I never thought about not returning. Today however was absolutely unacceptable. I had family visiting from out of town and figured we'd have a nice meal. Right off the bat our server (who I assume was HIGH as a kite) spilled all of our waters all over the table - honest mistake, but it didn't end there. He also forgot my guacamole so we had to tell another server to remind him to bring it out. In addition to that my order was all jacked up. I ordered Carne Asada De Tampico and got something entirely different. He also wasn't cognizant of that fact our plates were just accumulating on the table and didn't offer to take them away. A few of us had a decent amount of leftovers and asked for some boxes - he brought out just 2 of the smallest ones possible because he didn't possess enough common sense to gauge if the leftovers would fit in said boxes. We sent him back to get larger ones.  In summary this place has great food but the service is lacking hardcore. The servers are all high and in slow motion and can't seem to get anything right. He did knock off 10% from the bill but really it should have been more. The server was #41 Robert - if you get this guy do yourself a favor and ask for someone else, and even then it probably won't make much of a difference.  Might not ever return. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Portions and flavors were excellent!  Price was fair for our meal - very comparable with other restaurants in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Order consisted of queso, guacamole and assorted tacos. In brief lacking in flavor. The guacamole was not flavorful at all. Slow, inattentive service. Many better choices out there for mexican. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I work nearby the new La Paz, and I stop in a lot for lunch. I really like their housemade salsa and hot sauce. I usually order their black bean burger, or spicy New Mexican quesadilla."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The service when I went was great, I had a jalapeño Rita??? Soo good and defiantly different! The building has a fresh look to it and is super clean ;) being a sanitation freak I can say that this place cut no corners! The bar is super cool it looks like ice. It was packed when we went and there was a wait but we sat at the bar and they were really friendly. There's some stuff the bartender said they were working on but over all I was pretty impressed. Dinner was really really good the queso is amazing especially when we added spinach you can add other things which I thought was cool. I had the veggie burger which being a veggie snob I can honestly say was delicious! My friend had the new Mexican quesadilla which she loved too. We really enjoyed ourselves and will be back soon! ;)"}
{"text":"I was a big fan of La Paz when they were at South Blvd location and was looking forward to trying them again when they opened this location.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  Although the new location is nice looking and still serves awesome drinks and same great chips and salsa, their overall food quality is a notch above disgusting.  It appears that they have started to skimp on both quality and authenticity in favor of being trendier and hip.  I ordered their Chicken Fajitas and my friend had the Arizona quesadilla. The fajita platter had diced veggies (instead of strips) and what's even more unusual is that it had diced potatoes.  Diced veggies are OK, but the only downside is that you don't taste as much of the flavors of the grilled veggies as you do with strips.  The chicken was well cooked.  I asked for corn tortillas with the fajitas instead of the standard flour ones, but the server told us that they only serve flour or crispy shells.  What kind of Mexican restaurant does not have corn tortillas with fajitas?  The server did accommodate my request for corn tortillas, but they were the \"yellow\" corn tortillas which they use specifically for frying and making taco shells, which is very different in texture and taste compared to typical white corn tortillas used specifically for enchiladas, fajitas etc.  I could also tell the difference since they were soaked in oil and put on the grill to make them softer but doing so made them very chewy.  For $12, the Arizona Quesadilla was very thin and lacked appropriate amount of filling.  It was so thin in fact that you could taste more of the tortilla rather than the actual Quesadilla.  Only upside, and the reason for the two stars was that service was good and margaritas were decently crafted."}
{"text":"This place is a just ok Mexican spot to grab lunch or dinner in the Met area. We came on Saturday for lunch because we were in the area Christmas shopping.  The chips and salsa were actually pretty good. The chips were overly salty but we just wiped off the salt and it was no biggie! I actually really liked the salsa.  We decided to split the Mexican flag enchiladas. Basically, it was a spinach enchilada, chicken enchilada, and steak enchilada with refried beans and coconut rice (though, I am 99% sure that it was just regular rice). The food was good. The enchiladas kinda mixed together so it was a big old mix of cheese, sauce, and meats......hey, count me in! I believe the enchiladas were around $14 or so but it was plenty to split! The refried beans were kinda burnt tasting so I just let my garbage disposal of a husband eat them!  Overall, standard Mexican style food."}
{"text":"Husband and I tried La Paz for lunch today. It actually used to be located much closer to us, in the South End neighborhood, and we had always talked about going but never got around to it before it moved.  Anyway, the setting is nice. Very open and spacious, with great light pouring in from outside.   Our waitress was prompt with chips (still hot) and two heaping dishes of fresh salsa, which proved spicy and delicious. It's a good blend of chunky and smooth, and has fire-roasted flavors that come through really well.  Husband ordered the Tuesday lunch special - 3 tacos for $6. He chose beef and crispy, though chicken and soft versions are also available.  I was in the mood for something a little fancier, so I went with the Baja Fish tacos, which come in an order of 2 with one side of your choice, all for $11. Honestly, these should be called Seafood tacos, because your choices are cod or shrimp, prepared sauteed or fried, and since I was debating between the two fillers, I asked for a recommendation and went with the waitress's suggestion of shrimp, sauteed. I also asked for corn tortillas instead of the flour ones that come standard with the dish.  We didn't have to wait too long for our entrees to come out, but in the meanwhile, drink and salsa refills were prompt.  Our plates looked awesome when they came out! Husband had 3 heaping crispy tacos filled with ground beef and overflowing with lettuce, cheese and tomatoes. After demolishing his plate, he said that they were pretty good, but that he wished he'd ordered something a little more off the beaten path, and that his meal had sort of reminded him of a higher-quality Taco Bell.  I definitely had the winner of our two plates. Unfortunately, my phone was dead and sitting at home on the charger, or else I'd have some glamour shots to share with you of this beauty. My tacos, packed in two soft corn tortillas each, had three HUGE seasoned shrimp apiece, along with cabbage slaw, a big creamy ripe slice of avocado, and a little slather of spiced crema (described on the menu as \"chipotle tartar sauce\"). On the side was a tiny pile of mixed greens topped with bright, sweet & tangy mango salsa, and my side of choice, a cup of black beans with some crumbled cotija on top. The shrimp were juicy and bursting with flavor, and all of the components of the dish played well together to compose a veritable symphony for my mouth. I added some of the fire roasted salsa (left over from the chips) for even more kick, but they were great even without it. My beans were awesome too, very flavorful, rich, and with a velvety, creamy texture. I did not want to stop eating those beans, ever, but alas, my stomach ran out of room.  While Husband did not feel that his meal was the best he could have chosen from their varied menu, and said he likely would not order the special again, he was impressed by his tastes of my dish, and by the high quality of the ingredients and service throughout our meal. We'll definitely be back. As for me, I think I might have found a new favorite Mexi joint..."}
{"text":"This place is pretty bad.  I met a friend here on Monday night at 5:30 for dinner.  The restaurant was pretty dead during this time frame and our dinners still took like 30 or so mins to come out for some reason.  I ordered the steak street tacos and they were really bad.  My tortillas all broke as I was eating my tacos - never had that happen before.  The steak was super fatty and gross and chewy - not a fan. The meal also came with sides of beans & Spanish rice. The rice had obviously been sitting out forever under a heat light and was so dried out and gross - I only had a bite. I didn't even attempt to eat the slop of beans.  It was pretty pricey for the quality of food I got - I didn't even ask for a box to bring the leftovers home to my husband who isn't picky at all since I didn't think he'd even want to eat this food.  This place is a huge miss - I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"im from tx and i miss my texmex...yes this place reminded me of my texmex food because i have been so deprived probably..yes this is a chain but i dont care....reason being the chips were delicious and fresh, salsa was nice and chunky and had that wateryness to it. throw in a big burrito and some chili con queso and im a happy guy. this place is good and i really enjoyed my meal"}
{"text":"Wow, this place sucks. While waiting for our table, we were repeatedly ignored by the bartender. We must have appeared too we'll groomed in contrast to the rest of the patronage.   We had a party of 8. After all the food was dumped on the table, the W. Va. hick that was serving us came over to me and said, \"you must not have ordered\", which I certainly did because, that day, I had only eaten an apple and I was starving.  I do love it when I am assigned blame for a service mistake by my waitress.    So, at that point, I decided to forgo a meal and just have tequila - to kill the pain of listening to the insolent and aggressively poor-performing waitress and to help me better assess next steps for the evening. I ordered a shot for me and the guy next to me. She asked if I wanted salt and a lime. I said no. The shots came with salt and a lime.  Worse, I think the \"shots\" may have been premixed margaritas without ice.  They were certainly not the Cuervo that we had requested. So, I asked for two Patron shots, which were just what the doctor ordered.   After action assessment in brief - worst service I have had in years, maybe ever - can't even get tequila right - horrible patronage (could have been some LA5 gang members in there) - can't assess food because I was never given any, but chips were ok.   Recommendation - 1) don't go - 2) if you have to go, order a shot of Patron immediately - 3) make sure you get some food   The combination of food and Patron will dull the pain."}
{"text":"First of all...great location! The fajitas were good. They had zuchinni which I don\"t recall ever having in a fajita. The outside seating is great. You don\"t get a full view of uptown like neighboring Dressler's but it's nice. They have descent margaritas and good quesadillas."}
{"text":"Here to Charlotte on a business trip for a week and I was graving for Mexican food since I am from Southern California.  I had the burrito and was okay.  Not very authentic but will do for Charlotte.  Service was extremely slow!!"}
{"text":"Inconsistent :(  There are times when the food is good and times when it's not.  I usually order the chicken poblano enchiladas, the general flavor is really good. There are times when the dish is drowned in sauce, other times just a sprinkle; sometimes the peppers are grilled sometimes they're raw. Tonight my husband had to beef burrito it was literally just ground beef rolled in a tortilla with white cheese sauce on top... That's it!?"}
{"text":"Great food but terrible service on a Saturday evening. Drinks were not replenished once and server made promises then forgot to follow through. Would not recommend eating here on the weekend if you expect quality service. Great during the week when it's slower."}
{"text":"This is my first time at LaPaz. I never went to the old location and if it's anything like the new one I'm not impressed. We had a party of 8 and our server Samara was decent. The food wasn't great. The rice and refried beans were bland. The queso and salsa weren't  bad, but the guacamole wasn't the best, too much lime and not enough salt.  My homemade version is better. Probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I haven't been to La Paz since I moved to Charlotte in 2004 and it was located over on South Blvd.  Why?  It was just okay, and I discovered Cantina 1511 soon after.    Since La Paz moved to Midtown, we decided to give it another shot.  After making reservations on OpenTable, my first impression of the restaurant was giving my name and time of reservation to the apathetic host and having him bluntly reply, \"I can't hear you.\"  Not \"I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the noise\" or \"Sorry, I wasn't listening because I was staring at someone over at the bar.\"  The host walked us through the restaurant, past the bar area, through one dining room, and into the 2nd one with floor to ceiling glass windows.  For the noise level and it being a Saturday night at dinnertime, I was surprised the restaurant wasn't more full.    We immediately noticed that the restaurant didn't have much atmosphere.  There was very little decor and even less to indicate it was a Mexican restaurant.  Luckily, we were seated in a booth in this second dining room, because my partner said the table section covering most of the room looked and felt like a cafeteria.     Our server quickly greeted us, took our drink orders, and brought us chips and salsa.  I was surprised that the salsa was actually very fresh and delicious.  It looked like it was made with pureed chargrilled tomatoes, my favorite.   I ordered one of their specialty margaritas -- a vampiro.  It was like a cross between a margarita and sangria.  It came in a little tumbler glass instead of a margarita glass.  It tasted good, but for $10 and being a Mexican restaurant, I guess I expected a bit more presentation.   My partner ordered the Mexican Mojito, made with cilantro in place of the traditional mint.  This tasted pretty good (and sweet!) and came in a tall glass.    Our server came by after we depleted our salsa, but still had some more chips remaining.  He asked if he could bring us more.  I asked him for just salsa; no more chips.   Our dinners took quite awhile to be delivered from the time we ordered.  Usually, Mexican meals are brought out so quickly that you don't have enough time to rest a bit after snacking on the chips and salsa.  Soon after the entrees were delivered by someone else, our server immediately appeared with our salsa.  He didn't forget; it just took 15-20 minutes.    I tried the Chicken Street Tacos.  They came with two sides of my choice.  I appreciated the option of getting something different other than the starch-heavy rice and beans.  I opted for the guacamole and a salad, two \"healthier\" options.  It was a lot of food, though, and I couldn't finish the salad.  The food all tasted really good.  After finishing, it took too long to get our check and then even longer to complete the payment process.  All in all, we were in the restaurant for an hour and a half, and not by our own doing.    Would we come back?  Not with other, much better Mexican restaurant options in Charlotte (did I mention Cantina 1511?).  The food was good, but the service and atmosphere really bring the place down.    Atmosphere - 2 stars Service - 3 stars Food - 4 stars  Lastly, the room we were seated in happened to be the large party room.  There were a few large-sized tables in there with groups partying.   We were the only couple seated there.  I noticed that the (young) manager on duty was seated at one of them with his buddies the entire time, only getting up once in a while when one of the servers needed him.  Way to go, manager guy.  You working or partying?  No wonder the service isn't great when the manager can't even get his act together."}
{"text":"La Paz definitely has the best margaritas in town hands down. Even on a busy weekend night the service is impeccable also. They do take reservations so utilize that and you should have no problem.   The queso is a good choice for an appetizer and while I've tried a variety of their dishes I really love their quesadillas.   They also have different events that they host throughout the year so if you follow them on facebook you can keep up with what they have going on."}
{"text":"Boring!! That's the best word I have for my lunch today! I ordered spicy shrimp fajitas and not only did my plate come with only 8 tiny shrimp, they had no flavor at all.  I kept wondering why there was no one else in the place on a Saturday at noon and now I know why - I will never come back here."}
{"text":"\"Eek! Methinks not\" is an understatement. I wouldn't recommend this place if La Paz offered to pay me. Honestly, I can say that this was by far the worst Mexican food/experience I've ever had. Save your $$ and go to another mom-and-pop restaurant for food that's 10000000x better. I'm mad at myself for wasting $32 on lunch and eating crummy food.  Terrible service here ... I went after the \"lunch rush\" was over ... there was only 4 tables in the whole place. They were out of chips and salsa ... apparently the \"lunch rush\" wiped them out. We were told they were making more but during the entire hour we were there we never got any. What kind of Mexican place runs out of chips & salsa?!?!?!?  Our food was served without us even having silverware on the table ... and it took the server almost 5 minutes to come back with any for us. So we just sat there, watching our food get cold. After we were finally able to try the food, I almost wished I hadn't. It seemed like it had sat under the heat lamp far too long because the rice on the top was extremely dry/crispy. The steak in one of my enchiladas tasted like it was mass-produced days before and was reused ... super chewy and dry. My other enchilada was supposed to be spinach and goat cheese .. all it had was spinach and tomato.    STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"A few people have told me that La Paz just isn't the same since their move. Back in the day, they were a frequent lunch place of mine when they were on South Blvd.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but went with an open mind.  On my first visit I had the fish tacos - well one fish and one shrimp.  They were very accommodating in allowing me to try one of each.  They were good.  I would order them again.  The five stars come from my second visit.  I had the shrimp and steak salad.  They cook the steak perfectly to medium, as requested and the salad is simply phenomenal!   Their sun-dried tomato vinaigrette is delicious and was the perfect match.  If you have to eat a healthy salad, this is the one to pick.  The meat is spicy, tender and char-grilled.    If you go to La Paz with expectations of their former self you might be disappointed.  I think they did a great job.  New look, new menu....just the name remains.  Plus, their house wine is one of my favorites.  How can that be bad?"}
{"text":"We originally wanted Mama R's only to get there and realize it was a Prom Saturday, so we headed nearby to see what we could try. We get to La Paz and they initially quoted a 10 minute wait. We were starving, so this was music to our ears. Good thing we are pretty patient because we ended up waiting closer to 25 min for a table. Note to young host: better to err in more minutes and wait less , not  vice versa.  A fresh ( or seemed) salsa and chips are the start of the meal. Pretty tasty. He had the Acapulco Shrimp(mango salsa, avocado,onions, blk beans, peppers and coconut rice)and I tried the Tamarind Citrus Chicken ( marinated chicken, queso fresco, blk beans, coconut rice, avocado , mango salsa) He really cleaned his plate, but I could have left the orangy glaze from chicken. Tamarind and the glaze just did not fuse well for me. Will try something else on a future visit. Our server was ok and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Pretty basic. The food isn't amazing and it's not horrible either. If you're looking for nourishment, GO. One plus is the atmosphere. If you eat in the back part of the restaurant, you're surrounded by windows so that's pretty cool."}
{"text":"Saw that this place was coming to Metro and thought it was going to be another run of the mill mexi restaurant...and it seems to be so.   Huge bar, margaritas, tacos, quesadillas, free chips and salsa. Pretty much the basics. Definitely a safe haven for the taco-seeking diner.   One thing that sets La Paz apart is their Tamales. They are handmade in-house and are delicious. perfectly tender, just a little dry, hint of spice and the presentation is just as it should be. I got the pork Tamales. They come with slivered almonds and raisins and a few veggies mixed in. If you've ever had a sweet fruit like apricots, dates or raisins with pork, you know how much of a marriage it can be. This was nothing less than a welcomed flavor. Savory, salty and sweet with the pairing of a fresh Tamale. Definitely the bread-winner of the establishment.   The rest of the dish was mediocre at best. Standard ramekin of black beans. \"Roasted\" veggie medley which was in desperate need of flavor. The sides were lackluster and were left untouched.   My wife had the mushroom and spinach fajitas. Not too bad with all of the mise en place that came with, but there seemed to be a hint of soy in the veggies. I'm not calling shenanigans, but I'm thinking the chef is using soy sauce on their fajitas. Strange....  We at at a sunny, outside table. Service was friendly and attentive.   Not sure what goes on in the kitchen, though. Took over 30 minutes to get our food. Seems like they need to get some kinks worked out.   A-OK by me. Nothing spectacular, but I'll definitely be back for some Tamales."}
{"text":"The Thrill and the Legend are gone...  Once upon a time, La Paz was one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the Charlotte area.  So I eagerly awaited the return of this Charlotte Legend, after they shut down their South Blvd. operations.  In many ways, I feel the wait was all for nothing.  I went here, Friday, January 6th on my birthday with a couple of friends.  Its worth noting that at the time, I believe the new La Paz had only been open for business for about 3 or 4 days.  With that being said, our waiter was a cool dude, with a endearing personality, that made me feel a bit better about the otherwise mostly negative aspects of the evening.  Top of these was the fact that it literally took 45min to an hour for my party of four to receive our food upon placing our orders.  Luckily it was my birthday, so there were  tequila shots flowing, which definitely helped pass the time.   The tequila however, was not enough to offset the fact that the table-side guacamole we ordered was extremely bland.  We had to saturate it with salt and pepper just to give it any taste at all.  When our food finally arrived and hour after we ordered, I have to say I felt let down.  There's no other way to put it.  I ordered the gordo burrito with chicken.  As I remember, the gordo burrito version at the old location was huge and packed with cheeses, queso, meats, and all the other Mexican fillings you'd expect in a monster burrito.  I felt the present version of the gordo was small, skimpy and lacked a healthy serving of chicken.  As for my guess; its not that they felt their food was bad, they stated it was just missing that little something that takes a meal and a restaurant from good to great.  The other sad thing about La Paz redux, is that it feels very corporate.  Nothing from the food, location, bar, or ambiance inside feels authentic or real.  It feels like its being run by people who are more concerned with trendiness and the bottom line, than great tasting food.  To me, this is the definition of a place that \"SOLD OUT\".    Everything was just OK, and in my book, \"OK\" is a disappointment for an establishment that once had it all.  Remember the old saying, \"Legends don't die, they just fade away\"?  Well, this new rendition of La Paz has proven that the legend of great food, service, atmosphere, drinks, and location are truly dead and gone."}
{"text":"My first visit to La Paz was last Sunday during the panther playoff game. My friends and I were looking forward to having a good time but the service we received made it worse than the panthers losing! There were only 2 servers working so it took a whirl to get our order taken and after waiting 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge us we had to go to the bar and order there.  When the server finally came to take our orders and we had devoured out chips n salsa due to hunger he rushed us to get them. To make matters worse after 30 minutes our food did not come so we asked the server to check and he never came back and we had to take  repeated trips to the bar to get our own drinks. Another 20 minutes passed and our server reappeared saying that our order was up next. We waited another 20 minutes and the order never arrived and when we inquired we were told that the kitchen must have messed up but by then we were so upset that we told him not to bother. Let's just say we will not be returning to La Paz!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Tuesday night about 7:00 pm. When we walked in there was about 6-8 people waiting to be sat. After about 5 minutes someone finally came and sat the people waiting in front of us. We stood there for 5 more minutes with people lining up behind us. Finally someone (maybe the manager) yelled over and said it would be at least 10 more minutes before anyone could seat us. We asked why and he said the outside area was full.  We left and went to Hickory Tavern instead. As we walked by we only noticed two or three tables sat inside and 8 outside... Not sure if they were very short staffed or what."}
{"text":"Likely the only Mexican place I've ever visited and hated the food.  The burrito I had was not edible.    Service is slow and unhappy to be there.   Should be one star,  but I gave them a two since they have reasonably priced drinks.  Only head here if you need a drink in the Met."}
{"text":"This place was lame.  Weak margaritas.  Our server was nice but you could tell she was green.  A couple of us ordered the \"jalapeno slaw\" as a side and this stuff was like plain old boring cole slaw.  We addressed this to our server who took it to the cook who said basically, \"that's the way it is.\"  Where was a manager?  Food took a while too.  I was traveling through but I would not return."}
{"text":"We came here for taco Tuesday. After waiting almost an hour and a half we were thinking, \"well you can't really go wrong with dollar tacos\".... then La Paz did. I've been here a handful of times and have consistently gotten bad service."}
{"text":"This place wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Slow service on a non busy day. Typical Mexican food you'll find in just about any other Americanized Mexican restaurant - tacos, fajitas, quesadillas, guacamole, etc. Servers weren't sure if the refried beans contained pork fat or not. It was always a different answer each time. Suspect."}
{"text":"After two additional visits- one on the Foodie Tour where we made mojitos and guacamole and dinner friends I have slightly elevated my thoughts on the new La Paz. Thursday night is $4 margaritas. Which are served in a hefty water glass. Sundays means $4 sangria which I would like to try. I had the Mexican Flag enchilada trio. The best being the spinach and goat cheese one. Everything else is pretty middle of the road. I would go back for more spinach and goat cheese enchiladas. Sit in the bar area for tons of extra large flat screens."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch one day and it was delicious! The margaritas are a great size so you definitely get bang for your buck. I had the street tacos with veggies and it was so delicious. The Jalapeño cole-slaw was really good. The salsa had the rite amount of spice to it and the service was really good. Also try the pineapple-jalapeño margarita it is delicious!"}
{"text":"I've only dined at La Paz 3 times. The first time was when they were on South Blvd and I wasn't impressed so I never went back. Once they moved to the Met I figured I would give it another try. Again, I wasn't impressed with the food. The most recent time we decided to try again, we were wanting Mexican food and we happened to be at the Met shopping so we ate there out of convenience. We were greeted by the very friendly hostess and seated immediately. Good start. Our waiter came quickly and gave us chips and salsa and took our order. I ordered the spinach and goat cheese enchiladas. When we got our food, I took a bite and didn't taste any goat cheese so I looked inside and nothing. Ugh. Our waiter was busy taking orders from other tables so we flagged down another waiter and told him what the problem was. He explained that they weren't making the enchiladas with goat cheese any longer but they happened to have some in the kitchen so they would remake it for me. When it came out it was delicious. When our waiter checked on us he said he had no idea they changed the dish which I wasn't surprised about since I'm sure he would have told me that. When all was said and done we were very happy with our food and the service was spot on. Multiple people refilling drinks and checking on us. And the waiter who helped me even though we weren't his table was amazing. Our waiter even discounted our bill since my order was wrong. I wish I could give them 4 stars but with the menu not being correct and me getting something different than I ordered, combined with not being impressed the first 2 times I've been here, I couldn't do it. I hope they can impress me more if we decide to go again."}
{"text":"So disappointed in this place! It looks fun and is in a great location, but the food is really sub-par. The salsa tasted like something from a jar, and the chips were stale.  The taco salad Didn't taste fresh either. I asked for hot sauce, all they had was Texas Pete.  The margarita wasn't anything special either. It\"s too bad, because a good authentic Mexican restaurant would do great in this area!"}
{"text":"Thought we would try the new location. Like the new location and the layout and design of the restaurant. However the service seemed slow and food was so so. It came cold and the guacamole on the plate was brown. Looks like it was kept under a heat lamp. Ordered the fried ice cream for the birthday  boy and said no chocolate syrup twice. Still came with chocolate syrup.  Hope it improves over time."}
{"text":"Horrible. Enough said.  If you like food that sits under a heat lamp for hours this is your place!   Go to azteca instead. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"No, just no. The food was bleh at best. The shrimp in the tacos was fishy and chewy. The street type taco salsa was sour and gross... This restaurant really doesn't belong in the metropolitan complex."}
{"text":"The food is great. We love the chips and quesadillas. I had a salmon salad that was really good. I've not had anything that wasn't tasty.   The location is great. Midtown CLT is a fun and growing community next to the river and the greenway. There are condos and apartments popping up everywhere, and there are great places to eat. Parking is nightmarish on this end of Midtown, though. The Trader Joes garage is a real disaster of civil engineering  The reason for the low score is that the service has always been terrible. We've put up with it because we liked the food but it is consistently bad. One of the reasons you decide to eat at a Mexican restaurant is for the chips and salsa you get from the beginning. Today, they kept telling us for an hour that they were \"waiting on the chips\" to be made. It seemed like joke; like we all knew there were no chips. W e never got our chips."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of La Paz from my days in Atlanta, Ga.  I visited the South Blvd location many times and just experienced the new La Paz restaurant at Metropolitan.    The food and beverages were awesome as usual and the service was excellent. The dining room is very large and the decor fit the feel perfect. for an enjoyable meal.   I will be visiting La Paz many more time in the near future."}
{"text":"How do can I describe La Paz? Well lets see, lousy service, below average food that is over priced in a trendy neighborhood that is the best description of this place."}
{"text":"A last-minute change of plans transformed our girls night in to an out. We did not want to wait in a very long line for the cold temperatures but thought we had no options until the owner of La Paz walked by on the sidewalk beckoning all of us to join her and her restaurant. She is the sweetest kindest loyal restaurant owner that I have ever met. The restaurant struggles to keep alive a beautiful memory. If you go, it's a must that you ask her about it.  The food was good, the drinks were ok and the service was slow to start, but the staff was so friendly and inviting that they seemed out of place in such cold and unwelcome company as the other venues nearby seem to be on the surface. I felt like family over for dinner and it was exactly what I needed."}
{"text":"Instead of our regular mexican night at Don Pedro's, some friends and I decided to give this place a try. Decor was interesting. Service was pretty good. The queso dip was fantastic! The food wasn't extraordinary, but wasn't terrible. I ordered the Gordo burrito with beef. Nothing spectacular. I was a little disappointed. I think I've had better burritos from a food truck to say the least.The rice and beans were lacking in flavor. I think it's safe to say we will be returning to Don Pedro's."}
{"text":"This was the 3rd time I went to the new location at the Metropolitan, and 3rd time was NOT a charm.  Service- The hosts were not presentable at all, they weren't even wearing all black or dressed nice and not friendly.  The waitress took forever to come to our table. The food took about an hour to come to our table, only to find out that it wasn't our food!!  Mind you there were only 4 tables in the whole restaurant! They set out the food tray on the stand, made us drool and then picked it up and went the other way.  Food--The guacamole was very bland and the queso was not traditional queso.  It tasted like velveeta microwaved cheese.  The fajitas were OK.  Honestly, I don't know why everyone says that this is a Mexican restaurant.  This place is totally Tex-Mex.  There is a big difference between the two.  And it's not even good Tex-Mex!  Never coming back again. Especially not after my bill was $35 when I can get the same food that is much tastier at a REAL Mexican place elsewhere in Charlotte for not even half the price!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch last week and it was just fine!  It is located right at the Met and has parking in the horrible parking garage across the street - be careful - it is so crowded!    There is outdoor seating as well as a HUGE dining room.  I ordered the taco salad and was surprised when the waitress asked 'what dressing'.  That's the first time I have been to a mexican restaurant where they wanted to give me dressing with a taco salad.  So I declined the dressing and the rest is as you would expect.  It was a good price for a TON of food.    Everyone else really liked their meals and I loved the old La Paz's guac so I am sure I would love it here but didn't try it this time.  Service was really fast and friendly.  Would be back - especially to sit outside in the summer!!"}
{"text":"I was not only underwhelmed, but I wasn't even whelmed.   THE GOOD  The night began with high hopes: La Paz looks nice with a glowing bar table, high ceilings, and classy decorations. The 30+ people in our group arrived with chips and salsa waiting at the tables, with the promise of queso and drinks to soon come. Things were looking good.  The chips and salsa: standard - Very eatable, but not memorable.  Queso Dip: Decent - Good spicy cheese dip overall.    THE BAD  The ambiance: Way too loud.  - It is nearly impossible to carry a conversation with anyone beyond sitting next to you. The high ceilings and spartan decorations do little to absorb noise, sloshing everyone's conversation to a maelstrom of crazy buzzing. Don't come here looking for easy conversation.  House Margaritas: blah - weak and lacking much flavor. Other drinks on the menu may be more satisfying, but the house margarita was a waste of time and calories.  The Food: unanimously unimpressive - Street pork tacos were self-described as \"authentic Mexican fare\". I can say with much assurance (growing up in Southern California) that the tacos were far too heavy on the sweet  tomato-chipotle salsa and falling much too short on the onion and cilantro. Additionally, it was served without lime and rice. And the slaw was inside the taco. It looks nothing like the image in the menu. Major let down.  - The taco salad lacked the key ingredients of beans and rice, this salad is rather unfulfilling and bland.   - Vegitariano: A what? Looked very sloppy and soggy.     THE UGLY  The Service: hands down the worse service I had ever received. - First off, I want to be very clear that I attribute (most of) the poor service to lack of training and experience of the staff (as La Paz just recently opened), not to them personally. That said, I was preparing to slit my wrists with a jagged chip just to make the night end. Let me count the ways in which the service was lacking:  1) Disorganized:  --- Drink orders were taken twice.  --- Confusion arouse over who ordered what and even what type of food was on the plate.  --- Had to ask 3 people twice each and wait 15 minutes to get the salad dressing for the taco salad.   2) Untimely:  --- It took over an hour for our food to arrive: No updates, no offer of another appetizer. No offer of more drinks. No water refills.  --- We were ignored for an hour. Yay, thanks for wasting my night.  3) No water refills: This bares repeating.  --- Everyone at our table had to ask multiple people, multiple times for water to be refilled, each time we needed it refilled.  4) Unknowledgeable about food:  --- When asked for more information about a food item, one server read verbatim from the menu.  --- After waiting for over an hour, servers couldn't identity some of the plates. The rest of the table was awkwardly being served (by asking each patron if this plate was theirs. Also, see section labeled Disorganized above).  --- More importantly, they couldn't identify my plate--which I could see and identify from where I was sitting. It took asking two servers, waiting 15 minutes (while I watched everyone else eating), and watching a server bend down to examine my (now cold) dinner until I was served the very disappointing tacos. --- I'm sorry, but if you can't figure out what a pork taco is in a sea of enchiladas, taco salads, and vegitarinos, then someone, somewhere dropped the ball big time. Either that, or I have serious doubts as to the sourcing of your meats and construction of your tacos.   Despite being offered free dessert (as a part of our group deal), we opted to just get the checks and run. In all, we were there for about 2.5 hours on a Thursday night, which would have been fine for quality food, a comfortable environment, and good service. However, my experience at La Paz was none of these. I could tell that the servers were stressed out and under-prepared and my heart goes out to them. Insist on more training.   PS: On your menu, \"V Notates vegetarian dishes\".... I think 'denotes' is the word you are looking for. \"V Denotes\"."}
{"text":"Best Chips and Salsa, best Guacamole, delicious Steak and Spinach salad! Clean and nice atmosphere. Even the restroom was great."}
{"text":"This place was mediocre. Simply stated. We came here on a Friday night, sat outside, which was a nice environment. There was a live 3 man band, playing frank Sinatra, no complaints there+2. We ordered margaritas, classic lime flavored on the rocks. They were good +2! Definitely would recommend the margaritas, but that's where it stops. The chips and salsa were \"fine\", but that's because IMO it takes a lot to mess up chips and salsa. Chips were crunchy, salty and tasted fresh +1. However, their salsa was the blandest thing of salsa ever -1. Entrees, hubby got a classic burrito, he said it was good +2. We both got rice and beans and the beans were fine, but the rice had zero flavor. I ordered three flour tacos with chicken, onions, cilantro, and cabbage. Not bad, but it was missing something -2. The meal comes with an avocado type salsa but it didn't compliment the tacos right. Looking more for a verde salsa or something similar. The service was good. We had to ask for a few refills-1, but other than that, he was great to give us space and enjoy our time outside. This place definitely doesn't stand out as good Mexican food to come back, however the location is cool with the live band if your interested in that."}
{"text":"Its okay if you are in the neighborhood and really craving for Mexican food. The food was too oily. Importantly, check your bill. The 20% tip is generally always included in the bill and if you don't read the bill, you will end up paying double tip."}
{"text":"I recently went to la paz for lunch. when this.location first opened it was great but over the last couple years each time I go in and order one of my go to items it's changed. Nothing is consistent here.  This recent experience will be my last. They completely changed the menu item I picked out. I ordered the taco salad. It is usually a very generous item filled with really leafy greens. Th is time it was extremely small and had what tasted like bag lettuce in there (it was soggy)  Not only was the food terrible the owner was behind the bar with a black eye chowing down on some food and didn't even acknowledge us when we walked in Or any other guest..."}
{"text":"The waiter brought a bloody burger to me ....ugh I asked for well done........this is not good"}
{"text":"Ahh La Paz, what a long and twisted legacy you have here in Charlotte.  3 different locations, with different owners, and menu alterations.  While I thought the space on South was a great location, you now pop up in the new and modern Metropolitan in your latest incarnation.    Hence my first problem, you walk into this space with near floor to ceiling windows, concrete floors, and then heavy wooden booths and woodwork that only extends about 2/3s of the way up to the ceiling.  The juxtaposition is jarring and appears forced, like sticking a cabinet-style tube TV in a room full of IKEA furniture. Worse yet, the high ceilings cause echos from both the kitchen and the other guests that are constant and unpleasant.  Bottom line, it just doesn't work and the space feels underutilized.  Chips and salsa, as at most such places, are complimentary fare and not much has changed here for La Paz.  Salsa is the same as I remember and is a strong point for my tastes- fresh, very finely diced to the point of near-puree, and a kick of heat.    The lunch menu I saw had some standards and some new fare, but nothing that seemed inspired or \"outside the box.\"  With the modern space it would be exciting to see some modern takes on the standard burrito, quesadillas and tacos.  No mas here.  Tacos come two to an order with a choice of side.  My choice of this date of black beans was actually nice- black beans tasted fresh and were appropriately seasoned.  My fish tacos were a bit of a jumble though, as the fish portion seemed quite small in comparison to the slaw filling.  The fruit salsa inside also lacked vibrancy.    I do have to say, though, that our server (while seeming new to the business due to a slight sense of unease at our table) worked very hard to keep drink refills coming and then making sure we had plenty of chips and salsa.  It is obvious management is making a push here as our server also made a point to tell us about the survey/comment cards in the check folios and politely requested we fill them out unless we were in a rush.  I appreciate that- it certainly seemed like a honest request and reflected the fact that the business was new and trying to address deficiencies.    Prices for lunch were in line with what you'd expect in the neighborhood, which is another point where this La Paz just blends in with the rest of the crowd.  Obviously there is some work to be done here, but unless they can differentiate themselves from the more-established competition nearby, I can't find a compelling reason to make this place a regular."}
{"text":"Food was not good at all. I asked the waitress what their best dishes were. She said people often order the three enchilada plate. So I got it. The chicken enchilada was watery, every piece of \"steak\" in the steak enchilada was actually fat and ended up in my paper napkin. My friend said her fish taco was \"awful.\" The salsa had no flavor. And they were out of mint for mojitos so we just drank water. Regrettable."}
{"text":"I was instantly confused by the decor at La Paz. The sprawling blue bar looks completely out of place compared to the rest of the dining area. I ordered the Mexican flag trio of enchiladas, and none of the three varieties were good. The flavors of tamarind chicken citrus filet was extremely overpowering and sweet. And the margaritas were not great either. I won't be back to La Paz."}
{"text":"Was there for a gathering and they gave us free nachos and quesadillas. Everyone was quite helpful and friendly. Some of the drinks took a while to show, but overall was very happy with experience there. Would return."}
{"text":"It was 4:15pm during the weekend and mexican was on my mind.  Went to the bar and ordered a drink and asked for a menu....only to be told the kitchen didn't open until 5pm?  Huh?  Bartenders were ok...though real slow getting me another beer.  In addition is was like high 30's and they were stocking the bar via a truck outside....and kept the door open for 5+ minutes while all the customers at the bar put on their coats.........another example of thinking of the customer.....in Chicago someone would have been punched in the mouth.  So I had a few drinks and a bowl of Queso.  All and all the queso was good and I was full and decided not to stay for dinner.  Coming back again is a big if...I think 1511 on East will continue to get my business."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself was pretty empty, which isn't  a good sign.   We ask the server about getting some guac. No guacamole. Wait, what?! How is that possible? We asked our server and he said that they just got a truck in. Um, okay. Not sure what that means, but if you guys just got a \"truck in\" wouldn't avocados but on said truck? So the server said they did have avocados but no guac, again, how is that possible? How long does it take to make guacamole? In the past, I've had it made fresh, table-side (at a different restaurant) and it took all of 2-3 minutes.   Just skip this place, not worth it."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time today, I really like Mexican food so I was looking for something good. Well I've had better, I got chicken tacos, black beans and Mexican rice.  The rice was so hard it's like it was Mexican fried rice....wow.  Any who the tacos were ok, some of the chicken pieces were a little hard but other than that they were ok. The beans were ok nothing to exciting, the place looked better than the food taste. Not sure if I'll go back, the lunch menu is very limited. Oh well............."}
{"text":"The refried beans tasted like a bottle of liquid smoke. They weren't very warm and no cheese on top. Gross. The Mexican rice was clumpy and flavorless. The queso tasted like grocery store brand that was microwaved. The chicken street tacos were okay except for the KFC coleslaw on top. The chips and salsa weren't bad, but not great either. The server was distracted and awkward. Not helped by the silence-no music due to the speakers being broken? The place was empty at 5pm on a Saturday. I won't be back."}
{"text":"La Paz, now located at the Metropolitan complex, has taken a downturn since it moved from the South Boulevard location. Even when it was on South I felt much of the authenticity had been lost following the move from the original location in a charming house in Myers Park off Providence Road. Now it feels like another big box chain - without being a chain! My recent dinner was ho-hum, nothing fantastic, nothing horrible. The waitstaff was obviously green and despite the huge space being close to empty on a Sunday evening it took a long time for us to find our waitress to pay our check. I appreciate that La Paz has a diverse menu including salads other than a taco shell with iceberg and several vegetarian dishes but I am on the hunt for an authentic, good and inexpensive Mexican staple in Charlotte. I have a few places I plan to try coming up - what's your favorite and why?"}
{"text":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!!!!  It takes a lot for a person like to me to take the time to write a review, but this establishment's complete lack of customer service warrents one...For starters, the entire staff is completely disinterested...period. It's more of a \"social hour\" than a place of business for them. I had a problem with my order, the waiter charged me twice, and the OWNER argued that it was my fault for this particular mistake! Seriously, this is no way to run a business. To top it all off, on my way out, I overheard the \"owner\" and another employee saying discminatory comments about me-using words that should NEVER be used. I have never in my life ever encountered such repulsive behavior in a restaurant of all places. If you like your tacos with a side of hate, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"3 stars is being nice. I really hoped everyone else was wrong and that my once fabulous La Paz did not go down-hill...but sadly they were not.   We requested a seat in the bar area as this was a big football weekend and my boyfriend wanted to see the game. The bar area was full and so we were told to watch for a table and just sit down when once became available. Five or ten minutes later this happened, so we sat at the dirty table for about 10 minutes waiting for acknowledgement.   Our server apologized and explained that we should have never been seated at a dirty table. We weren't \"seated\" at all, so this lead me to believe the hostess was just being a bit lazy by telling us to watch for people to leave and seat ourselves. I will say our service for the rest of the dinner was great.   The salsas were very good in my opinion. I always like having a choice between red and green. We requested a small side of Guacamole as my boyfriend wasn't eating much so we didn't really need the entire $9 table-side version. Our server happily obliged and we were pleasantly surprised by the size of the side- it was more than big enough for two people and only 1/3 the price! The Guac itself needed a bit of lime but it was creamy and pretty good.   Now here is where the food takes a big down-turn. When I use to go to the old La Paz I would order the same dish every time, the Mexican flag Enchilada trio. Well they went and changed it on me! Everything tasted the same, instead of one spinach, one red, and one cheese. The chicken was barely distinguishable! The dish itself did not appear to even be three different colors thus forming the Mexican flag..instead it was all mashed together. Despite costing roughly the same as the old, the serving size was noticeably MUCH smaller, and the quality/taste just wasn't nearly as good. I wouldn't go back and get that dish.    Honestly, I think I would rather go to Azteca or Cantina 1511..."}
{"text":"Very simple: Poor service-Over charged We came in with a group of 7 (not very large in my opinion), We just ate and had 1 or 2 drinks a piece (birthday dinner before going out). My food took 20 minutes longer than everyone else, despite ordering the same thing as one of the others. They were kind and waited for me, causing their food to get cold (i begged them just to eat ahead of me, and i would eat alone when it came out). After that poor service, I was still automatically charged a 20% tip... 20%..20 is for someone offering good service. Having my meal come out 20 minutes after everyone else is NOT good service. in fact, it really ruins a meal. I don't agree with an automatic good tip (regardless of how many people), automatic 15%, ok i can see why that is necessary, but an automatic 20%..automatic good tip regardless of service (and in this case, bad service).. i will never go again. food wasn't great, service was BAD (half of us didn't drink, the other half had 2 drinks, but we still had to flag the waitress down for those drink or anything else.  (I crossed out the tip and wrote the amount and signed my check, they still charged my account for the tip, i believe this is illegal, as the receipt i signed did not have the tip on it) TLDR- They will force you to leave a good tip, even after the blatantly give you Poor service."}
{"text":"Food took forever, drinks ran dry 3 times. Asked for 3 different beers on menu, out of? Asked for any hotter salsa or hot sauce, sorry we don't have any. He did offer Texas Pete...ooh wow the real taste of the border. I declined to eat with our group. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The loopy margarita is amazing! i love it because i love mexican food and having a good cold drink with it but i am a vodka drinker so this was perfect! Chicken enchiladas are amazing! Fun outdoor seating as well with great view of city."}
{"text":"Ate at La Paz years ago with little reason to return. Decided to try them again and yep...remember the lackluster flavors and friendly if not horribly disorganized service. When the waitress asked about the food, we mentioned the bad rice and she admitted that depending on who was in the kitchen changed how the food tasted. Nice.  BTW, our waitress was sweet and helpful despite the disorganization or lack of staff...wasn't sure what kept them MIA.  Don't waste your time or money...there are dozens of great Mexican restaurants in this town."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with friends for the first time last night. Overall, I was a little disappointed. The chips and salsa were pretty good. I had the veggie burrito as my main meal even though I really wanted to try the baja shrimp tacos! Anyway, I should have gone with my initial gut menu choice as the burrito was just so-so. They put some kind of pico in the burrito which I do not believe was mentioned on the menu (I could be wrong), but it was not creating a good taste for me. The rice seemed pretty good but I only had a few bites. I got a salad as my other side (instead of beans) and it was a fairly large salad but mostly greens. There were some tomatoes but they were chopped into very small pieces and there were only a few. I would like to give this place one more try but so far, I'm not all that impressed!"}
{"text":"I don't like writing negative reviews but what is up with La Paz lately? They are always out of avocados (so NO guacamole) and I have found their servers to be argumentative. I ordered a salad that came with cotija cheese and avocado. Not only were they out of avocados, but my salad was delivered sans cheese. I told my server the cheese was missing and she insisted it didn't come with cheese. $13 for lettuce and bland chicken? I think I'll pass on that."}
{"text":"The place has great Margaritas IF you can go on the days that they drink specials. But in my opinion, a basic margarita should not cost $8. As much as I want to like the food, it's just not that great. Growing up in Texas, I know what good Tex-Mex is and this place just doesn't cut it. The staff is wonderful and friendly and the atmosphere is pretty cool also but the food is just not up to my standards."}
{"text":"WOW! Called this one with ease! Poor Service, God Awful Food, Lack of atmosphere, Poor management, Flaat Beer, Obvious signs of business distress - SHUT IT DOWN!"}
{"text":"It was slow on  a Saturday night but the service AND food was amazing. the bbq pork nachos and the chicken tacos were AMAZING! convenient to Best Buy, Target, etc. I'd LOVE to live in METRO just to take the elevator down to La Paz or ANY of the other cool joints on the first level!"}
{"text":"Perfect location and a nice venue.   have not been disappointed every time I have come in.  The mojitos are rocking and they have started a lot of new/fun nights.  Mexican Bingo, Dancing, etc.  Give them a shot, you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"*sighs*  SMH....  I tried to like La Paz, but when my food came out cold, I threw in the towel and my hopes and dreams died.   I walked in with an open mind and hoped that maybe my experience would be a decent one.  The huge floor the ceiling windows I liked.  The openness of the restaurant area we sat in, I liked.  The slow waiter that forgot to refill our water glasses, I didn't like.  Like I mentioned earlier - when my food came out cold...I was sad and starving.  I ordered the  fish tacos and opted for the grilled shrimp.  Aside from the weird orange sauce stuff that they put on the top and the fact that they were cold, I imagined that they would have been good if hot.  Mexican rice was stale and kind of crunchy and dry.    On the positive side, they had $2.00 Corona Lights on special and they offered a Skinny version of a Margarita which my friend said it was tasty.  *shrugs* so...meh...at least I tried it."}
{"text":"I did take out, so can't speak to the service that you would get if you eat dine-in. The food is tasty, but I can definitely say that I like the atmosphere/decor of the old South Blvd location better. Will I be back? Oh yea!"}
{"text":"Had a friend in town and TRIED to go for Sunday Brunch (a standard treat at the old location).   The Urban Spoon and City Search BOTH say the new location is open at 11am.  Alas...when we arrived at 11 we found the doors locked.  When an employee finally came to the door - she told us they weren't going to open until 12.  When I mentioned that I had read they opened at 11 -- she rudely scoffed at me and said  \"where did you read that?\"  I mentioned several of the website names and the fact that one of their own employees I had spoken to earlier ALSO told me 11.     This employee didn't apologize for the confusion or seem the slightest bit concerned that I had made special plans to come to the restaurant.  She just said...\"Those websites don't know what they are talking about. I don't know who you talked to, but we don't open until 12\".  With that, she simply closed the door in our face (not even a  \"good bye\").   My friend (a former DIE HARD La Paz lover) said \"well...they're never getting my money again.\"  I agree.  I think the food is probably still good. But the service is HORRIBLE.  Until they at least try to act like they care about their customers, I don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here on Dec 6th, 2014. The service was absolutely horrible and the food to match. We waited over 40 minutes for lunch with no one in the restaurant. I will never go again. We got the trio enchiladas...gross!"}
{"text":"Food was average. Service was slow. House margarita was average. Could go someone cheaper for the quality of food."}
{"text":"I am very surprised at the average rating for La Paz. I have been there many times and left impressed (and very full) each time. This is my first time posting a review for them, so I will try to summarize my experiences there.   The food quality is definitely above average for Mexican restaurants. I would say it is quite on par with 1900 Mexican Grille and Cantina 15-11.   The cocktails are very good as well. I am not much of a liquor drinker myself but my date loved their margaritas.   The customer service was excellent. I believe I have had a different waiter/waitress each time and they each seemed very knowledgeable about their dinner and drinks menu and also very friendly and attentive. It is usually very crowded, especially for dinner, so being waited on rather than having to wait is crucial.   Each time the store owner has made a point to greet us and ask how our experience has been. He even shared his business card with me (which had his personal cell number on it) so that we can call ahead and get the prime seats.   I recommend this place to anyone who likes good quality Mexican food."}
{"text":"If you are gluten free like me you have a hard time finding places to eat and your go to choice will always be Mexican.  So here I am looking forward to atone good food when I find out the tamales have trace amounts of wheat flower in them and their streak in marinated in soy sauce.  I was very disappointed yup heart this but I had a backup meal thought out, the spinach and goat cheese enchiladas, which we're good if not a little spicy, but I like some spice every once in a while.    Over all, I would say their lunch menu is normal for any gf person with tacos and other corn tortilla options available, but their dinner menu has a better range of choices for me so from now on I will be a night owl visitor!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and was excited when my group chose this place. After being seated with no menus for at least ten minutes, we got up and asked if someone was going to help us. We were finally helped, but service was still slow, the food was not good, and to top it off they added gratuity to our tab. I will never return!  1900 or Azteca are so much better and cheaper."}
{"text":"Best quesadilla I've ever had! Me and some coworkers ate here for lunch today; it was most of our first times here. This food is definitely Americanized... But it doesn't mean that it isn't good.   They give out baskets of chips to nibble on. They weren't very warm like I expected them to be but they were very good  The menu is not as broad as most Cantinas but there were some good choices. I got the Arizona quesadilla half which was extremely filling. Other coworkers got a tamale plate, fajitas, and a veggie quesadilla. No complaints from our table.   Service was good and prices were reasonable. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"After visiting once I thought everything was OK, but wanted to give La Paz a second shot before my review. With that said, it didn't change. Overall, everything was just okay. The chips were blah, not real hot and not real fresh, just okay. I did enjoy the salsa. As for my entrees, I chose the fajitas and there were about four pieces of chicken and a plate of veggies. Where was the chicken? Accompanied with pretty blah rice and beans. However, I did enjoy the side of guacamole.  The location is a lot nicer than the old South Blvd. location, but as I felt at that location, they don't have the flavor and freshness they did years ago. With so many New Mexican restaurants out there, I wish they would focus on better tasting food."}
{"text":"Great location, nicely decorated interior and some good stuff on order, La Paz stands out from the usual Central American joints that dot the Charlotte landscape. Yes, they have the usual burritos and quesadillas (we had one of each), but the stuffings aren't the same boring stuffings.  For instance, I chose the Arizona Quesadilla which came with a tasty sundried tomato pico de gallo and fresh spinach. Very tasty. And they have both \"half\" and \"full\" size which was awesome since I could see that I was filling up on chips fast.  Yep, the chips are thin and salty and perfect for scooping up their salsa. I liked it, other than it needed more zing to it. Firm and not wet, easily scoopable.  Not nearly as cheap as the $6 burrito/rice/beans joints, but I think the quality is here."}
{"text":"I need to update this review based on some changes La Paz has recently made to their recipes and their service (my highest weighted criteria).    Our recent waiter, Ryan, was great and on top of everything. So that alone really improved my thoughts of this place.  They also updated drink recipes (some margaritas) to make them more delicious, and also food recipes (the jalapeno coleslaw was incredible!).  This place is more of a restaurant/bar that has a Mexican theme, rather than a Mexican restaurant.  The drinks and appetizers are great and there are plenty of TVs in the bar area to watch games."}
{"text":"Not too bad, decent nachos - but their Chicken Tortilla Soup is awesome! very very spicy, but awesome!  Best Tip about this place: they are a host location for Wine & Canvas!"}
{"text":"Great experience. Fast and great service. Had the Mexican flag enchilada. One of the best dishes I have had in a Mexican restaurant.  Easy parking."}
