{"text":"What a perfect find for my Italian self!! My boyfriend & I went here for date night and absolutely loved everything from the service, to the food & the Italian ambiance! I highly recommend visiting if you are looking for a delicious Italian meal that is well priced! We enjoyed the spaghetti & clams, Rigatoni and yummy antipasto board! This place makes me proud to be Italian... I will definitely be back with my friends & family!"}
{"text":"The lunch is good but the dinner here is even better! Best Authentic Italian in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Went there first thing thing this morning. Ordered 2 simple sandwiches. Took over 35 minutes to make. 6 workers lounging around. Completely ignored. Totally disgusted with their service. Overpriced. Food okay and felt worthless when I left"}
{"text":"Great fun. Good pizza, great experience. Go on Thursday or Saturday when owner plays guitar and sings. Family operated, and you'll feel like you're part of the family too."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian food I have ever had in AZ. It is fresh and homemade (not processed), some of the ingredients are imported (imported for a reason--they are authentic and amazing) and the flavors are marvelous.  I recently discovered that the person who runs this restaurant mentored the guy who runs Pizzerio Bianco (also excellent)! That makes a lot of sense.  I am gluten free, so they make an eggplant sandwich without the bread for me and it's fantastic!  The wine is also very nice.  The atmosphere is casual, friendly and unpretentious.  I almost didn't write the review in fear of having it become too crowded as everyone's favorite Italian place!"}
{"text":"Omg!! I just purchased a salami to take home with me...it got as far as our hotel room... I'm headed back to get two more for the road.. Maybe even three... Wow so good!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible!!! My husband and I have been going here for years. Tonight, while eating his salad, he bit into a thumbtack . We kept quiet to not cause a scene and discretely told our server. (We were with our 2year old daughter) He and the owner proceeded to imply that we planted it in there . No \" sorry\" ... Nothing. Dirty, filthy restaurant ."}
{"text":"Eating at Andreoli's like eating in a homely kitchen. I just love the freshness, authenticity and the simplicity of the food. Yes it is expensive for a hole-in-the-wall kind of place. But I'd rather have fresh and homely food any day."}
{"text":"Un pezzo d'Italia nel deserto dell'Arizona. Gianni è italiano DOC e mantiene inalterata la nostra tradizione culinaria a Scottsdale. Tutti prodotti di provenienza italiana (vera, niente robaccia d'imitazione). Inoltre il caffè espresso mi ha fatto sentire davvero a casa. Chiedete se c'è un piatto del giorno o una specialità particolare, Gianni non vi deluderà!"}
{"text":"The food was good. The portions were very small and the price very large for a hole in the wall restaurant.  Service was nonexistent."}
{"text":"Interesting place ... Small and unassuming Everything was delicious .... The bread fresh and crisp , the pasta cooked fresh and al dente . I would definitely eat here again ."}
{"text":"Service is typical Italian...a bit curt and you will wait...and wait...and wait... for your authentic goodness but OMG is it worth it! I discovered this little gem a few months ago when a bartender at the Merc bar (Italian import named Francesco) told me to check it out. The chef owner bakes all his own Italian pastries, makes his own pastas, pulls his own mozzarella and imports his meats and cheeses. He changes his menu  daily and makes wood fired pizzas on Wed and Sat. This is my favorite local Italian spot hands down... but for full service authentic restaurants, I suggest Michelina's in Scottsdale(amazing and upscale) or Harley's Bistro (equally amazing but less formal and good luck finding it) in Central Phx.  Ciao!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is true to the Italian cuisine. Not everything is smothered in red sauce and cheese. My mother was born in Italy, she's the biggest food critic and she loves this place, especially when tripa is on the menu. Everything is cooked and prepared perfectly. The pasta e fagiole is just like my Nonna's, and the bread! Oh the bread! Delizioso! Mangia, Mangia!"}
{"text":"This is our first visit and I'm blown away. Sandwiches are delicious, bread is perfect, everything is fresh and the service is great."}
{"text":"Andreoli's was recommended by a great friend that is as passionate about food as I am.  He mentioned that their pizza was really good.  I ordered the pizza,and it to me was just OK.  However I ordered the grilled calamari and it was off the hook!  It was a fun casual atmosphere.  The only thing that was a turn off to me was the gal that took my order at the counter.  Her attitude was anything but friendly and very disinterested to communicate.....not very sociable or polite.  I guess that would be the norm if ordering in a NYC restaurant, but it is Scottsdale!!!  I will try anything twice.  Hey, not every experience is a home run!  I went again specifically for a glass of wine and the grilled calamari, and it was just as amazing as the last time.  The gal behind the counter taking my order.....was also the same attitude as last time.  I guess if I go back I can ask my date or the person I am with to order.  There is something to be said about attitude!!!"}
{"text":"My hope is no one will read this review as it's our secret and we really would like to keep it that way...as former New Yorkers and Bostonians we claim precedence over what's good Italian and mediocre. Andreoli is about as authentic, original, and delightfully delicious as anything in town, or for that matter, around the country. Giovani, the owner feels the same way if you ask him. Branzino, rigatoni with sausage, and artisanal bread that is beyond compare. One more thing, it's rustic in ambience and you need to go to the counter  (ordering not serving which is at the table). We find this charmimg, and those who don't, well, that's just fine by us..."}
{"text":"I forgot where I was for a moment when I stepped into Andreoli.  How did I end up in a cafe reminscent of the ones I lingered over vino at in Tuscany?  

I was surrounded by wooden antique shelves filled with Italian dry pastas, olive oils and mini jam jars.  The long deli case is filled with all kinds of meats, cheeses and homemade pastries.  

The menu (available on website) is comprised of panini, antipasti (calamari, pizzas) and salads.  You order at the deli counter and if you're eating in, they bring the food to you and on real plates.  We ordered one thing from each section:

- bresaola con ruchetta e parmigiano: thin-sliced air-cured beef on an arugula salad and shaved parmesan  $6.50

- panino di tizio: grilled homemade sausage, bell peppers and onions in a toasted baguette  $7.50

- le palle del papa: baked breaded rice balls filled with meat sauce, parmesan and peas  $5.00

- sfogliatelle: shell-shaped multi-layered pastry filled with homemade ricotta  $2.75

The sausage and air-cured beef were delizioso!  The rice ball was the size of a baseball and packed with tasty fillings.  My only complaint was that the arugula salad contained hardly any arugula, but that's not going to stop me from coming back to try the daily pasta specials. 

Can't handle the hefty airfare and expensive Euro?  This is the next best thing!  Molto bene!"}
{"text":"Wow
This place is incredible. Me and 5 friends visited scottsdale and came here. The sandwiches were incredible, the pasta was great and the pizza was awesome. We ate outside and just hung out there. The bread was perfect. Always nice to hear a real Italian joint carrying giardeniera

Great family run business. We will be back"}
{"text":"With delicious, authentic Italian food, incredible and friendly service, and a fantastic atmosphere, Andreoli is a great place to dine for a quick bite or a lengthy, relaxing meal. 

I will never say this about another place; however, walking into Andreoli feels like you just strolled in off of the streets of Torino. 

Bella!"}
{"text":"I have been on the hunt for Amarena Cherries ever since the Pasta Bar started my addiction over a year ago and today I sat down and called all over the valley for 2 hours before in amazement I found them at Andreoli.    After looking at the menu on-line I knew my husband would want to eat there and we hopped on the road for our adventure.  

We were barely two steps in the door when sure enough it was decided we would stay for lunch.  The young lady behind the counter, I am thinking the owner's daughter, couldn't have been more helpful.  I had picked out my sandwich on line, but switched to a daily special of rigatoni with ricotta and cherry tomatoes and my husband spotted peppers and sausage on the counter and he was sold.  

Our lunch was fabulous and we returned to the dessert counter for a treat to take home.  Sadly only so much fits in the fridge.  My husband wanted to have his parents come up right away as they are huge \"real\" Italian foodies too.  As tomorrow is Sunday and they are closed we will have to wait a day to return, but we will definitely be back soon.  I also loved the antique tables and items mingled in the store."}
{"text":"Holy cow the food here is amazing!  We had mozarella with tomatoes, antipasta, penne with veal sauce gnocci, and a sandwich and it was all unbelievable (as it always is).  However, the experience wouldn't be complete without the waitstaff, Francesca and Mike.  Francesca is an outgoing girl that isn't afraid to add to your conversation, and that only adds to the laid-back, family atmosphere of this place.  Mike is a friendly guy, and he's always up for a good time in the right environment.  Ha.

I would highly recommend everyone giving this place a shot.  It is a bit expensive, but  it's worth it!"}
{"text":"The best food in Phoenix/ Scottsdale!!!! We are not easy, coming from NJ. Have had a hard time finding good food here for 12 years!!! This place is as good as any in New York!!! Ambience takes getting used to but the food is worth it!!!
The service is great, family run. Can't wait to go back!!!'"}
{"text":"A friend invited us... Wow I had the grilled calamari was amazing.. The Singer sang Italian songs.. just Beautiful.. the food was amazingly fresh and Real Italian not the crap out Dear..!!! THE PIZZA AND MUSIC I THOUGHT I WAS IN ITALY... BRAVO... 
P's...the canoli for breakfast and dark chocolate w/ hazelnut  sent me to the moon an back....Lol: )"}
{"text":"You will either love or hate this place.  For me, it's like going back in time and being in my grandmother's kitchen again.  Admittedly, the service is just OK and the lunchtime wait can be a bit long.  I make it a point to call in my order ahead to avoid that problem.  Their eggplant sandwich is delicious."}
{"text":"Super disappointed on a Saturday afternoon.

We absolutely loved going to Andreoli's and sincerely hope that yesterday was just a off day for a favorite restaurant of ours.

We literally drive 24 miles (one way) to get our Italian fix and we had planned for yesterday.

We ordered the gnocchi as a primi, and secondi was to be bistecca fiorentina ala Sangue. 

We had to ask for our waters, our wine, and other things we just sloughed it off, as that is typical and italian. Nothing rushed. We certainly were not in a hurry but it seemed like our order was forgotten.

Everything arrived at once which when we ordered we indicated pasta first, steak second.

The Steak arrived medium well to well. We expressed that while we were not trying to be difficult, we ordered our steak specifically rare. That the steak presented was near well done. When you are paying $22 or more a pound, you kind of want it the way requested. 

So the server took it back. 

Rather than fix the issue, our order taker returned. Expressed that she looked at it, and found it to be lightly pink in the center. That it was only the edges that were well done. 

Now I don't know if she though we were youngsters or what, but trying to convince guests a nearly well steak is rare, and presenting it to us again and asking us to accept it twice really killed the whole meal. We stated that we were sorry, but we could not accept the steak the way it was cooked.

No offer of a re-do.

Our wine went to waste, and we left hungry.

We were absolutely sad, wasted an afternoon and fuel. 

Though things happen at times where people forget, and we are forgiving, the fact that it was pushed upon us to feel bad about a cooking error should not be placed on guests ever."}
{"text":"Overall great experience. The service was excellent and the food was even better. I'll let the photos speak for themselves. Will definitely go back. The calamari was so good we had to order it twice."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviewers.  The girl working at the counter was not friendly.  I ordered one of their sandwiches and I asked if they could please add prosciutto to it.  She replied with \"no, we don't mix meats\".  Really?  Pretty sure I'm the customer and if you're not willing to give me what I want, I won't be back.  Hence, I'm never going back.  The sandwich would have been much better if they made it the way I requested it.  An Italian sandwich with just one meat?!?  It was bland.  Bread was hard and flavorless.  My friend loves Italian food and he got the Rigatoni Bolognese, which he thought was OK but nothing special.  DeFalco's is better, especially for sandwiches.  Oh, and do not order the tripe, I think the reason is self explanatory."}
{"text":"I went here last week for my first time (dinner) and I was impressed by a few things.

1.  The dinner menu was written on a board when you first walk in.  Every night it is something different but you could always order something off the lunch menu.  This is truly exciting because obviously the menu is always going to change....different experiences....

2.  Andreoli/wait staff were extremely pleasant and the mood of the restaurant was very relaxed.  Ask all the questions you want about what is on the menu and even make simple requests to suit your taste.

3.  Restaurant was full of Italians speaking Italian.  Obviously the food has to be good and authentic if it is full of people from that country.

The food was excellent and out of the norm.  I had a monstrous steak with squid ink risotto on the side.  Steak was cooked exactly as ordered and the risotto was extremely creamy/different.  Andreoli even brought out another dish that he wanted us to try just for fun.  

I invite other culinary explorers to try this restaurants Italian food.  If you think the Spaghetti company or the Olive Garden is good Italian food then raise the bar and try true Italian food.

Lastly, good place to take a date....."}
{"text":"This place is cute, quaint and authentic, but grossly over priced for a deli with no table service. The food is good, fresh & authentic. However, $16 for a plate of simple marinara style pasta that u order at the counter is outrageous. In addition, 1 can of Italian tuna is $10. Something u can get at Cost Plus World Market for $4 max. A small bottle of mineral water is $6.50. Everything in the store is way-way over priced. Good for a cup of coffee & home made dessert."}
{"text":"Used to love here.  Went in to get bottarga.  The guy behind the counter thought I was asking for the moon or something and was rather snarky.  He had never heard of it, even tho I bought some here two or so years ago.  No longer my \"go to\" Italian grocer."}
{"text":"We disregarded the high prices in order to patronize a local entry but after six years you would think the owner or the owners family would offer a word of graditude or friendly greeting. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. It ruined great food. Never want to come back here ever! Italians need to learn what the real customer service is here."}
{"text":"Wife and I met local friends here for dinner. The place looked a little sketchy sitting in a strip mall parking lot like a converted Dairy Queen. Our friends beat us there, had a nice bottle of Italian red open and a table on the patio. I was a little apprehensive until I realized our friends are regulars, they raved on the food, and we went to the counter to order.

The cases were loaded with Italian deli meats, cheeses, olives, anchovies, aged t-bones, a massive veal chop...things were looking up. We looked over the blackboard menu and the regular dishes, and made some selections. Not your run of the mill pseudo-Italian joint.

The rigatoni with meat sauce was very good, rich, spicy, and tubes were perfectly al dente. The grilled calamari was exceptional, not overcooked and rubbery as one comes to expect. The house made mozzarella salad with tomatoes and basil was reportedly excellent, though my wife offered none to me, bogarting it entirely. Everything delivered a sense of freshness and had a home made quality.

Service was friendly, familiar, like a neighborhood place that you would return to again and again. The payment scheme was strange, as you go back to the order counter and pay as you are ready to leave. But that was no problem. And prices were very reasonable. I would come back to Scottsdale just to eat here again."}
{"text":"They have good baked baguettes and the price was $1.50 last month, however raising the price to $2 per roll during the holiday's is ridiculous.  The female cashier was short and unprofessional.  While i was waiting for the rolls, she was rude to the next three customers spending money.  They need to work on their customer service and I vowed never to go back."}
{"text":"We saw Andreoli's on triple D. Knowing we'd be in the Phoenix area, we decide to stop by for a bite. 
We ordered the Italian Antipasti to start. Homemade meats did not disappoint. The prosciutto, made in house, was salty and creamy. The Black Pepper salami had a perfect balance of spice. The Capacolla was very flavorful. However, the portion was extremely small for $9.95. We had 3 slices each of meat, 3 tiny pieces of cheese, and 3 olives. 
Next we ordered the Tizio, Italian sausage and pepper sandwich. The bread is perfectly chewy on the inside, crunchy on the outside.  It had great flavor. The side salad was also good, house greens with a citrusy white balsamic. The sandwich ($8.95) itself was a disappointment. We requested a slice of provolone cheese be added to our sandwich. The server, while polite, informed us that there could be no additions to the sandwich as the owner was a purist when it came to the food. Our sausage (patty) was over charred which left only bitter grill taste in your mouth. The sandwich was very dry, containing very few peppers and a heap of onions. 
Though we usually are fans of Triple D restaurants, Andreoli's was overall a disappointment."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night in perfect Phoenix weather and had a great meal! Definitely try the Caio Sandwich and the Rigatoni and Sausage."}
{"text":"So my Italian friend who lived in Italy for three years recommended this place. They have the best deal ever in their roast pork sandwich. I never get it because their daily specials are so good. Deserts. I like it when they are busy because sometimes they can be curt and short with me and start yelling to each other in Italian and I'm not in a snobby Scottsdale, Americanized version of old an world market, but in the real thing, lol. I love this place. Everything about it."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years, recommended to me by a great Italian chef. 
It's the best in town, hands down. The bread is incredible on their sandwiches. I continue to get the bastardo each time in, which is usually once a week. The deli is great as well and they have a good assortment of Italian goods you can't find in AJs."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing except my fish the fresh shrimp, calamari, lobster marinated and grilled. It was prepared to far ahead of time. However the four others in my party thoroughly enjoyed their meals. I highly recommend eating here. One of the most authentic Italian restaurants I've ever eaten at."}
{"text":"Amazing food, authentic Italian and real high quality products, my favourite Italian restaurant in the Valley hands down. The staff is great and Chef Scorzo is a genius with his creations . I highly recommend that you try this place , its an experience your tastebuds won't regret"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of meats and cheeses. I love the antipasto."}
{"text":"4.5 Can't say enough great things of the quality lunch we enjoyed at Andreoli's today! It's been on our list to drop in but usually we find ourselves free on Sundays which is unfort their only day off. So at least we brought ourselves about this gorgeous spring saturday to be impressed as soon as we opened their doors and walked into Calabria, Italy aka Andreoli's personal kitchen.

Indeed scrumptious meats and cheeses at the counter welcomed us along with shelves adorned with trays full of his handmade desserts and pastries. The Nutella croissant called to me but had to pass as our entrees left us quite satisfied.

A self proclaimed prosciutto addict I ordered the #4 Forza Italian sandwich and the best part surprisingly was not the smoked meat itself but the ahhhhmazingly delizioso bread, a texture so wonderfully lovely crispy and crunchy on the outside and a tender doughy springiness to die for. Indeed I've found my new local baker in Andreoli! The yummy side salad was also dressed with a splendid vinegrette.

Hubby's spaghetti clam entree was indeed that, more yummy clams than spaghetti proportion, and yes that is what we want and have been missing since coming back to America. We really don't need carb overload when there is such fresh seafood available! 

As the local farm fresh boom has overtaken yoga as the latest fad, we should however remember to continue to celebrate and respect imported goods which is also in great supply at Andreoli's, as no doubt authenticity in foods should also be a not forgotten virtuous trade.

So run and go now before they close as you'll be regretting a Sunday without an open door into the heart and home of this Mediterranean grocer!"}
{"text":"Yuk! Food and service. Had to ask a very grumpy server who we rarely saw for utensils, water, napkin... pasta taste like it was boiled in bad water. And no Parmesan cheese??? Chefs Board (meat and cheese) was a joke. Just a few slices of meat and a few cubes of cheese. I know we eat out far too often, but this was indeed a pretty  expensive and crappy experience all the way around experience. Ordered a pizza from Yo Pauleys right next door while we waited (and waited, and waited) for our bill."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with the family on sat night, it was packed. We sat outside until a table opened up but it was worth the wait! The food is expensive. .no other way to put it,  but my 17 dollar lasagna while not a large portion was very good! Do yourself a favor and order a plate of fries.  I did not try the deserts but they looked amazing.  Staff was very courteous.. and got us an extra heater when we were outside..This place is a diamond in a business park.."}
{"text":"I noticed Andreoli's, and actually went by it many times on my way to and from different businesses in the Fry's center. But for some reason, I had never gone inside.  Since I live nearby, I try to explore all the interesting eating places in immediate vicinity, and one day I decided I was hungry for an Italian sub.  Since I was near Andreoli's I decided to give it a try (plus the Vermont Sandwich Company was closed).  

Entering the deli, it was very nice inside - very comfortable looking and small, with a few tables. Since I was looking for a sandwich to go, I looked at the menus on the reader board/white board and ordered.  The sandwich came in a to-go box, with a side of salad. There was no one else in waiting, and it took several minutes for someone to notice me - but that was ok since I had a chance to go over the menu. The person that took my order was very informative and nice.

When I received the sandwich, I was initially disappointed, since it seemed small for the price, and as always, I was hungry.  But I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived home, and had a chance to taste it.  It was very good - the bread was perfectly cooked, and the meat and cheese were very complimentary. 

I have gone back several times and  tried different sandwiches and pastas, and everything I have had is delicious. So if I am really hungry, I will go to other places in the area. But if I am craving authentic Italian food, and am out for a walk, I go to Andreoli's."}
{"text":"Great, authentic Italian grocer that serves sandwiches and salads. I had a sandwich with  prosciutto, mozzarella, and grilled peppers. everything was incredibly fresh and delicious. They also have excellent pastries and cakes. I tried the tiramisu with a cappuccino and it was delicious. Finally, they had some mid-week Champions League football playing on a big tv.  

bottom line: can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Genoa deli in Oakland  is better!

Waited 30mins to get water.
Waited 35 minutes to get a sandwich.....

Not worth 35 min wait!!!!! Service - a joke!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. We went there because of the excellent review by guy fieri from the food network and I'm sorry to say he could not be more wrong. We ordered 3 specialty sandwiches and it took 35 minutes for it to arrive to our table. This was on a Saturday afternoon around 4 pm with only 2 other tables being occupied. Once they arrived the sandwiches contain 2 slices of prosciutto and 2 slices of mozzarella and several marinated peppers. But the final insult was another table was seated and I timed their food arrival at 9 minutes. This was when I confronted the manager about an explanation as to why it took 35 minutes to make our 3 sandwiches and only 9 minutes to bring out the food for the other table. All the manager did was say he was sorry in the most insincere manner I have ever seen. I would give them zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Ate lunch with a friend here today and I received excellent service as always from the great staff they have, especially from Sinai.  The bocca di rosa & patatine fritte were absolutely delicious and perfectly prepared.  Can't wait to eat the beautiful chocolate croissant I took home as well.  Great meal and weather on the patio!"}
{"text":"Our very favorite restaurant. Have not had anything that was not good.
As to those who said they did not care for Giovanni and his daughter's attitudes, so what? Maybe they were responding to your attitude. I have always been treated well....with a smile and friendly attitudes. 
My favorite dessert is the Meringata......Yum!!!!
If we lived here, we'd come at least once or twice a week. When visiting, we are here once a week. It's like being in Italy and I love seeing Giovanni sitting at \"his\" table with his friends who stop by."}
{"text":"Heard about Andreoli's on this site called Yelp.com. Steered me right. Freshest ingredients with a friendly staff. I tried one of their fancy sandwiches and was very impressed. Great bread, fresh mozzarella and plentiful meat on the sandwich. 

It looks like an Italian deli on the inside with soccer playing on a TV in the background (classic). Real Italians preparing and serving your food. The sandwich comes with a romaine salad with house dressing already on it. The dressing paired well with the salad and made for a perfect sized meal. 

Will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I won't reiterate by describing the atmosphere and menu options as prior reviewers have done an admirable job in listing the tastes and divining over the details of the atmosphere (except no one mentioned the mismatched chairs and tables, which I find charming).  My only intent in reviewing Andreoli is to say that I love the food and atmosphere but have been very disappointed in the prices.  It is just not a good value for the money when you can get comparable quality at other Italian groceries in town for much less money.  When I was charged 1.50 per fig for fresh figs from the case last week I decided I had to write the review (I just picked up a dozen large, fresh figs at Costco for $5.99 this evening).  That kind of overcharging is insulting and will lose this grocer money."}
{"text":"Hell what is this place, its like a special kind of heaven.

Let me just say it is intimidating but so worth it. Huge tip, get a latte, and 3 croissants you wont be disappointed at all. If thats all you eat here its worth it, literally the best Ive ever had, and Ive had lots. 

Pasta always good, sandwiches always good, bread always good, dessert always good, proteins, veggies antipasto, always good.

Bottom line one of the best meals in PHX area so far. I went twice in two days it was so good and I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"I Can't get enough of this place. The food is always phenomenal...I usually get the gnocchi or rigatoni with sausage. The rigatoni has fresh noodles and some of the best sauces I've ever had. This is not the frozen pasta and re-heated type restaurant - You can really taste the quality. Don't even try to compare this food with maggianos, Guidos or Defalcos, it's not even close. It has a very italian atmosphere, staff is always attentive, and has a super clean bathroom. 

I'm baffled by some of these bad reviews. Seriously people, if you have a problem with this place, go back to the Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Most authentic Italian restaurant I have been west of the Mississippi. The best deep fried fresh calamari I've ever had. 
Everything is great!"}
{"text":"Today I had the sempronio sandwich...prosciutto, mozzarella and roasted peppers.  The bread they use for the sandwich is so good.  Crusty on the outside but soft on the inside.  The quality of ingredients is top notch.  They do not cut corners here and you can taste it.  I thought the portion size was right on point and the price was in line with the portion size.  I'm not sure why a few yelpers have complained about size and price but I guess we all have different expectations.  I have also had the eggplant sandwich and it is wonderful!  I eat 1/2 for lunch and the other 1/2 for dinner.  It's very flavorful and very filling. As for the sempronio, I never leave 1/2 for dinner, not because it's small, but because it is so darned good...I can't stop eating it until it's all gone.  I've never had their pastas or dinner meals but I plan to.  Keep up the great food Andreoli's :-)"}
{"text":"If you are not one of their paisans (part of the Italian family or go there every week) they treat you like crap.  Food was good but would not go back. We waited 15 minutes for a seat and when the owner finally got up from taking up a table of 4 to sign papers for a car he was buying....... they tried to give the table to one of their good customers.  We bought a bottle of wine and finished it at the restaurant and was charged $5 for a corking fee.  please explain that ......................The owner and I'm guessing  his daughter who was behind the counter was real rude........... When we left I commented on a dish that someone was eating (it looked real good) the patron said you can get one to if you come here often........WOW -I guess I don't look Italian"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worse service I've ever experienced. Arrived at 6:40 PM, placed our order (mainly fish dishes) and as of 7:56 PM and after two trips to the order desk we still had not received our food. People who came after us, ate and left and we were still waiting. We finally left without eating!!
The attitude also left a lot to be desired!! I'm 71 years old and have eaten at many restaurants throughout the world but by far the service and attitude at Andreoli's was the worse I have ever experienced!"}
{"text":"A friend of ours is a food critic and about 3 years ago he recommended this restaurant/market to us. We are from NY and we were looking for an amazing Italian restaurant in Scottsdale. We didn't think it existed until we visited Andreoli's! The food here is always great. Our kids love it and the staff is always so kind and welcoming. Their porchetta sandwich is fantastic. You have to go to Rome to get one this good. My daughters favorite is the gnocchi, it's addicting. The branzino is fresh and delicious. I can go on and on. Truly authentic Italian cooking right here in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Worst dinning experience! My fiancé and I eat out quite a bit and this place is not special at all. The waitress forgot to bring me my coke and then I had to ask two different people two different times to please bring my coke to my table, it arrived half way through our meal. We had a table of 8 and when our food arrived, we were given one basket of bread. Each person had a small piece of bread and as we were eating, I tried several times to ask for more bread, but no one would even stop to speak with me. I then went up to the ordering line and asked for 3 baskets of bread. About 5 minutes later, we were given 2 baskets of bread.
When I went to pay my bill, the guy charged me for 5 baskets of bread, I told him to remove the coke from my order since it didn't arrive until after my meal and that we did not get 5 baskets of bread. The guy replied \"yes you did, you got 3 baskets at the beginning of your meal and then you ordered 2 more\" I corrected him and told him we got 1 basket and he started to argue with me saying that he saw the guy bring my table 3 baskets and then 2 more. The manager then came out and told me I had to pay for 5 baskets of bread and I told him that I only received 3, as both of them began to argue with me, I just gave up. I will never go back, the food is not authentic, it's normal Italian food just like we make at home. The food is over priced, the wait staff that I had which involved, 1 girl who ignored me, 2 guys who helped take our order, the manager and one of the guys who started to argue with me, they were are extremely rude and had zero manners."}
{"text":"I heard about this place many times from many different people. It's a great idea to combine deli and restaurant this just doesn't seem to be executed very well. 

The place is nice and comfortable. You can sit inside or outside. The staff is nice. You order at the counter and pay at the near by register. After paying they give you a number to place at your table so they can bring your meal. 

So like I said, it's nice decor, it's cozy, and the employees are nice....

It's really just the food that's not good. We ordered  pasta fagioli to share and we each had a sandwich. My sandwich was eggplant parm.

First let me say the bread was pretty great! 
The eggplant was stringy and mushy, and the sauce was so sweet it wasn't edible. They brought the sandwiches before the soup. I guess it's not that big of a deal but it would have been nice to have the pasta fagioli first. Well, that is what I said in my head before I tasted the bowl of beans and olive oil the brought us. This was not edible. 

The sandwiches come with a side salad. One of our side salads had a hair in it. Not ours. Not edible.

The mozzarella cheese tasted home made but not good homemade. It was extra mushy and runny. 

Oh I also ordered a slice of coconut cake. It looked amazing! All of the baked products looked amazing. I had to stand in line again to get the cake even though I had paid for it previously. The first bite... Sadness... Stale.. Hard crusty cake. 

They gave me the money back for the cake but not for anything else. I didn't ask though. Oh well, you win some you lose some. It's never fun to leave a restaurant hungry."}
{"text":"Love this spot. Best authentic Italian food and atmosphere. Very casual environment. Their specials are delicious. I like their expanded seating areas."}
{"text":"I just had lunch there the other day with my family. I ordered the eggplant parm. It seems more like stewed eggplant. It's not fried. It's in pieces. Mostly the skin of the eggplant is on the sandwich. There's hardly any sauce on the sandwich & it only has a small amount of mozzarella. It comes out warm not hot. The only good part of this sandwich is the bread.

One girl that we interacted with was very rude also. She seemed to be very friendly with the people she knew & not nice to others. I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"The food is very good, but the prices are a bit higher than most (see other reviews).  Does not quite match up with Giuseppe's."}
{"text":"Today I'm having the prosciutto sandwich and the prosciutto plate The food is excellent and the service is excellent"}
{"text":"Family owned and operated Italian eatery & grocer.  Service is top notch.  Food amazing!  We dined outside on the patio surrounded by grapevines and lights. We ordered the caio sandwich and the zia rosina salad.  The baguette is very good, the meat was well seasoned.  The salad was simple and so delicious.  We ate light and indulged in several desserts.  Meringata - amazing - still craving this! Pieces of meringue in whipped cream with nuts - heaven!  The fresh strawberry cake was light and not too sweet, just right so delicious!  Sfogliatelle very light and flaky it had a hint of lemon and lightly powdered sugar.  We were stuffed and we had even shared the sandwich.  We look forward to returning and trying other menu items. Love the glass case with all the delicious baked goods, there are some amazing looking chocolates as well that we need to try next time.  The place was packed with Italians -- a very good sign!"}
{"text":"Got the Cosa Nostra sandwich. Very tasty with spicy giardiniera, a perfectly crispy baguette, but not much beef. The included small side salad was simply mixed greens with a vinaigrette, but was fresh and delicious. Might try again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Nice little Italian place to eat. The meals are fresh but a little pricey. I had wine and rigatoni with sausage. Very good. Service is good...although it's walk up and order even at night. They do bring you your meal and the bread is fresh. Good place to take visitors and they also have a small market."}
{"text":"PROS:
1. Sandwich was very good. Great bread, meat, and cheese.
2. Fair prices for the sandwiches and salads.

CONS:
1. The entrees sound amazing and I would really like to try some of them, but can't bring myself to order a $25-$35 entree at a \"deli counter\". If they had table service and if it were more of a restaurant vs. a deli/cafe setting, I would be more inclined to spend the money on the entrees."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited today for the first time (we're on vacation) and we were incredibly impressed!  I'm Italian and from the East Coast and this place did not disappoint.  We ordered the cannoli as an appetizer and it was perfection. Crispy and flaky on the outside and perfect sweetness on the inside. My husband ordered the #1 - sausage, peppers, and onions, and I had the #3 - prosciutto, mozzarella, and roasted peppers. Amazing!! The bread was to die for and the mozzarella was unbelievably creamy. My husband loved his, too. Both came with a side salad - just greens and dressing which is all you need. 

Atmosphere is very cozy inside with lots of worn wooden tables to choose from. My only complaint is the portion sizes....because I didn't want the food to end. :)"}
{"text":"Great folks - authentic food.  Try and order from the specials (although the whole menu is good).  Great desserts as well."}
{"text":"Been here 5 or so times now. My mothers side of the family is 100% Italian.  Food from Andreoli reminds me of family.  And I love hearing other patrons enjoying their meals while speaking Italian. Recommend, recommend, recommend."}
{"text":"I saw this place on a recent episode of Diners, Drive Inns & Dives. I was expecting some good food and what I got was not so good.
I ordered a sausage sandwich and asked to add provolone cheese (at a charge). They said they do not make to order. Okay, Strike one! What I got was burnt sausage patties on a burnt french roll. The sausage tasted acrid & tough while the bread was hard to bite through.
Strike two! The people working there were not friendly and were bickering among themselves. No one greeted you or even cracked a smile and the food was over priced and I felt like I was back in Italy Strike three! 
Maybe they were having a bad day...It happens:-("}
{"text":"What Andreoli's lacks in pretentiousness, it makes up in excellent food. The reviewer who said \"amazing\" was spot on. I visit whenever I am in Scottsdale, stopping by for lunch or just a cappuccino and pastry. I also like to pick up a sandwich for my plane ride home; I have worked my way through half of the sandwich menu so far and loved each and every one.

The staff are great. They are friendly and helpful and have great recommendations. And there is always a soccer game on the TV."}
{"text":"Dirty , worst customer service I've ever experienced. Overpriced for just average food. Don't waste your time or money. We waited over 30 minutes to order and then 40 minutes for our pizza to be warmed up. The owner is pompous and arrogant ."}
{"text":"First and foremost Andreoli's is an overpriced Italian grocery store.  As it is a grocery store, visitors should not expect table cloths or good service,   Many of the unusual items it carries can be found for less at nearby AJs, but not the broad selection of cheeses or salumi.  The homemade hot lunches can be very good, but this is not the place to bring the boss.  Because the food is homemade, it varies in consistency from day to day.  I will say, as one who lived in Italy for many years, the dishes are indeed authentic and worth a try, if not worth the price.  One warning: Don't order the pizza and expect an ordinary pizza.  It's a rustic pizza, made with bread dough.  We did not like it.  Andreoli himself, incidentally, can be quite grumpy to those he does not know."}
{"text":"Belisimo! Italian at its finest in Scottsdale! These guys are making a lot of things in house that are quite amazing. His house made procuitto is dynamite! I had the pleasure of taking home some cheeses and cold cuts as well as few other items that are not readily accessible at any regular grocer. This place has a lot to offer. Living in northern California, we still are deprived of some some decent Italian meats that are anywhere near the taste from the old country. I'll definitely be stopping back I. The next time I'm in Az. Also, the Panatone selection around Xmas time is awesome! Hopefully they bring back the Loison brand. They were a hot commodity at our place."}
{"text":"Very authentic ingredients, great food.  The sandwiches are amazing, very simple ingredients and very tasty.  A tad bit pricey though.

I would recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Italian deli."}
{"text":"What an insult! You have lost three food-loving customers by your arrogant attitude today. 

We spent 1 hour, 15 min. there today having a business meeting during a downtime (2:00-3:15 pm) in the back of the restaurant.  Your business was very slow during this time period, with less than 5 or 6 tables being used at one time.  We ordered 3 beverages and a \"to go\" jarred item, spending $20. 

We literally were told we could not have a refill on our beverages unless we ordered food. And, then, the waiter added that we would have to leave if we didn't order any food! 

It is understandable if your restaurant was busy, that you would not want guests taking up table space and not eating. But that was not the case at this mid-day time period.  

That incident, in addition, to the fact that you blatantly have a reserved sign at the  closest parking spot to the front door marked \"Chef Parking\" shows how much you really care about your customers.  You don't!
 
Although we were certainly not big spenders today, one of us was a new customer, who had planned to bring her Italian husband to dine there soon.  She will not do so now based on this treatment, and neither will the rest of us. By the way, we have spent many dollars in your restaurant in the past.

If this is the way you want to treat people, live with the consequences!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good down-to-earth lunch from a small italian grocer.

I was a foodie's nightmare back in the days and lived on the same exact subway sandwich for a whole year. That somehow traumatized my tastebuds, and now I shudder at the thought of any sandwich regardless of ratings as I view sandwiches as a source of disgusting evil.

Closed my eyes and bit into my porchetta sandwich, must say that the meats were very well seasoned and fragrant. It was enjoyable and I didn't go crazy.

Other than that, the chocolate croissant was delish, cannoli was just okay.

Andreoli also has some ridiculously cool pottery/hardware shaped chocolates that tasted pretty normal but made my eyes jizz."}
{"text":"Solid Italian food - great taste and generous portions. Grilled calamari was tender and flavorful as was the eggplant sandwich. A nice surprise in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice, and each time the food was terrific. The bread is so good, we buy a loaf to take home.

I really go out to dinner so I can finish with a fabulous serving of cake - the Coco cake is coconut cake with whipped cream frosting and chocolate shavings. The next time I had the pistachio cream frosting with a yellow cake, husband had the chocolate mousse. All were delicious.

Great place with great food -"}
{"text":"Great, authentic, Italian products and dishes. Went on a Saturday afternoon when everyone was watching the Italian soccer game and the place was so lively and fun! Had a blast just hearing everyone yelling over the game in Italian!"}
{"text":"Old World Italian cooking in the middle of the desert.  I'm not sure how the family ended up in Scottsdale, but this Italian grocery/restaurant is a gem and a pleasant surprise. 

All the breads, pastries, sausage, pancetta and salami are housemade; the cheese are imported from Calbria.   The food is not only fresh, housemade & delicious, portions are extremely generous. I've had veal scallopini pounded so thin and cooked to such perfection that I could cut it with a fork; and the serving was so generous it could easily feed two.   

Being from the West Coast, I had reservations about eating seafood in the middle of the desert; but those fears were unfounded as the seafood is flown in fresh daily and lovingly prepared.  The Fettuccine con L'Astice al Pomodoro (Fettucine with Lobster and Tomato) is housemade pasta with fresh, whole lobsters cut in two; the dish is succulent, flavorful and simply outstanding.  

The service is warm and inviting, the atmosphere is vibrant and family-friendly.   It's wonderful to be amongst so many Italian patrons and hear Italian spoken amongst the patrons, waitstaff and kitchen -- the ambiance genuinely feels like Italy."}
{"text":"Love this place. My first visit was for Festa Di Natale a once a year event.  There was a beautiful display if holiday pastries. They were so tasty and addictive!  Along with the treats we ordered pizza and an eggplant sandwich. Spectacular! The sauce on the sandwich and pizza.. Perfect! The eggplant was melt in your mouth and the pizza so hearty and not overloaded with cheese. 
Yes yes yes we will be back! 
As for service, it was friendly, courteous and speedy. Prices? I did see olive oil that was a bit pricey but your probably getting great import quality. 
One more time.. Yes we will be back! Very authentic and delicious!!"}
{"text":"Andreoli is a must go restaurant... food is legit folks working there legit.  Such an unassuming place but enjoyed every second.  The food was truly amazing"}
{"text":"Three stars basically because of price. The food was good, not anywhere near the best Italian I've had, but very, very overpriced. I have no problem paying for good food, but this just wasn't worth the money. For four of us - including one child's meal - it was $100. And that was with no appetizers. Guessing once you're featured on Guy Fieri's show, that justifies charging double the price of a normal meal???

Had the gnocchi, penne with veal sauce and lasagna. All were good, but they didn't wow us. Also, not sure why they are an Italian grocer, since they have only a handful of grocery items. But you can buy a loaf of their homemade bread for JUST $8.75. WTF? I can walk out of a bread-only bakery in NJ with two loaves of Italian bread and a dozen fresh baked rolls for $2!!!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian Deli and foods. We came for lunch and got the #2 and #8. Sandwiches were good but mine was a little dry but not too bad. Salads were very good and come with the sandwiches. I would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great grilled calamari, however both pasta dishes were bland, my pasta was almost hard and the eggplant was mushy. My husband had the gnocchi which was well made but the sauce was bland. Very friendly staff however and nice atmosphere. Will probably skip it in the future. I understand what Al dente is, but this was very hard. Also I thought spice and flavor was the cornerstone of Italian cooking? Maybe we were there on a bad day."}
{"text":"This place is always on our list when we want to indulge in some carbs. The bread tastes like it was sent from heaven above. Everything is always delicious. Try the fresh mozzarella, it's the best I've ever had. The desserts are very good and not too sweet."}
{"text":"I am giving my favorite grocer the best score possible, BUT!  Has anyone else encountered the table nazi?  We had not visited for awhile and did not know the routine. Had our \"hands slapped\" figuratively because we did not like the little \"deuce\" table she stuck us at while there were 7 tables more suitable. because we merely ordered wine and antipasti!

We love the staff...until we encountered the owner's daughter. Really?  A lesson in GRACE would be appropriate. Maybe next time we can see some kindness that is due to customers. Food is amazing and we will return, but some discipline is in order for a unkind, ungracious yet beautiful daughter. There is hope."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in town! Great atmosphere and speciality authentic Italian fare. From the illy coffee to the biscotti. Bellisimo!"}
{"text":"While there are groceries sold here, the real emphasis is on their italian deli and the other foods they serve. The food they serve, sandwiches, salads and entrees, are fantastic. The pastries, including sfogiatelle and chocolate croissants, are fresh and scrumptious. The place is soccer central. The television is always on ESPN Deportes. 

The spaghetti a la vongele ($25.00) is absolutely the best I've had in Phoenix. Almost makes me think I'm near an ocean. My companion loved the veal chop ($34.00). Both entrees came with a salad. There are a number of genuine italian beverages, including orangina and birra Moretti.

On previous visits I enjoyed a number of their sandwiches. They come with an arugala salad and there isn't a clunker on the menu. The forza, the cafone and the abuffino are my favorites. Sandwich prices range between $8.25 to $8.95; not cheap by any stretch. However, like a wise old man once said, \"Good oats command a good price. But, if you're willing to settle for oats that have been run through the horse once...\" (LOL!!)

Some reviewers have had less than desirable service. I can only say that the service given to me and whoever was with me was top notch. The young fellow behind the register and the young lady who brought our food were courteous, generous with their time and kind to those friends of mine who were not familiar with italian food. 

Count on spending at least $15-$17 per person. That said, it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Great place to go for lunch. Absolutely the best Italian I've had. Great atmosphere and perfect service. Love this place."}
{"text":"Most incredible Italian food this side of Venice. It's one of three fabulous Italian restaurants and I am an Italian food aficionado. And that is said Huntley"}
{"text":"The moment you walk in the door and hear Italian on the TV and those behind the counter speaking the same you get the feeling your food is going to taste as authentic as the people who prepare it- and it does.  We tried several items the pasta was great and the Big Beef Sandwich with sauteed onions also good.  The people who work here are very friendly and the service was fantastic.  They played with our girls who loved their bread and pasta and often giggled when the waiter joked with them.  We tried two deserts (dont know what they were) but they were also great.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Went here with a few friends and our kids... We had the most wonderful experience. It's a family environment and they treated us like family. Can't wait to return and try their chocolate croissant!"}
{"text":"Yeah. You know what it is. The feeling of the perfect sandwich. Going in your mouth. 

That perfect bread. The meat. The cheese. The flavors arouse your palate the same way an adult film does for a 14 year old. Yeah. Just like that. 

After meeting up with Yelpers last night at the International Supper Club, I was informed that I work very close to Andreoli, so I decided to place a quick to-go order today. Went online, and saw the most catchy name possible....The Bastardo. 

Ok, it wasn't just the name. It was the olive tapenade, the pecorino, the genova salami and the side salad. It all sounded so perfect. And it was. It was everything as I had described in the second paragraph.

Freaking amazing.

As soon as I arrived (within 10 minutes), my sandwich was ready. Everything was perfect. I am in food heaven. I am coming back to order my cured meats.

Everything is a touch pricier than normal, but service is FAST. and MUCH faster than DeFalco's. I still LOVE DeFalco's....but this is closer to my work....and the speed of service makes me a very, happy man."}
{"text":"Superb.  Wonderful fresh and tasty food prepared to perfection.   Went for lunch and loved it.  The atmosphere is friendly and cheerful.  Simply wonderful."}
{"text":"This was the worst restaurant experience of my life.  We got served cold meatballs and they acted like it was our fault.  Then, I requested red sauce or ranch for my calamari and the owner came unglued about it. He told me that I can not eat my calamari that way and would not give me any sauce.  Then, he told me to leave the restaurant because I said that is the way I like my calarmari. This was my first time and it will be last time.  Really, just a little sauce and I get asked to leave.  Salad was dry and bland as well."}
{"text":"First time here.. had the penne.. also splurge on the pistachio cake if you have room.. ended up buying extra meat sauce to take home..  I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food and people working are authentic and care deeply about what they are serving. The pastries and desserts are absolutely delicious. I don't come here too often but when I do I often wonder why I'm not here weekly. Price is slightly more expensive than a traditional lunch, but certainly well worth it."}
{"text":"Comment from Linda S. of Andreoli Italian Grocer 
Business Owner
4/6/2017  We're sorry your experience at Andreoli was not what you expected. You had three of our popular sandwiches, each under $10. We must disagree with you that our sandwiches are flavorless - in fact, each component is made in house or imported directly from Italy. We are meticulous about the quality of ingredients and we are committed to going the extra mile to deliver the extraordinary for our customers; we encourage diners who are not as concerned with that level of attention to detail to go elsewhere.

Thank you we will. Being from San Candido Italy and having gone to culinary school in Florence as well cooking in Italy and other European countries I will seek authentically good italian food other places. Ciao"}
{"text":"Fantastico!
OK, that's almost all the Italian I know - my ancestors are not proud.

You can choose any of the sandwiches on their menu board and you'll be happy. I especially like the forza italia and the porchetta but you really can't go wrong. In addition to sandwiches you can get appetizers and salads. 

The staff is friendly and patient if you don't know the ingredients. I should mention that they have a small but excellent baked goods section and a wide selection of Italian meats and cheeses.

A warning - most sandwiches are about $9 and they come with a salad side. You'll never go to Subway again after you've eaten here.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"The best Italian deli in Arizona! Meats, cheeses, desserts and fresh loaves of bread... I feel like I'm back in NYC. The food is always made fresh and it may be a little pricey but you get what you pay for.... I give them 5 canolis...."}
{"text":"I've been to Italy twice, and I've still never found a canoli that beats the ones at Andreoli. Every entrée here is worth trying, but I'm especially fond of their desserts and pastries. The service is fantastic because it's family run and they really enjoy taking care of their customers and making sure they know they're appreciated (especially if the owners are there). It's quality and customer service that you won't find anywhere else in the area. Also, the interior is really adorable and cozy as its filled with one-of-a-kind odds and ends antique furniture. Definitely a must-try place!"}
{"text":"We were supposed to be in Venice, Italy today. We had to cancel our trip. Went to Andreoli for lunch instead and were not disappointed. Do not expect a fancy Italian restaurant. Do expect a fabulous assortment of pastries, sandwiches and pasta dishes. Nice selection of wines and beers in a venue that has the feel of a corner shop in Italy. My wife had the homemade sausage sandwich and I had the \"Bastardo.\" We are going back next week to continue our new quest of trying everything Andreoli has to offer.

Expect to hear a lot of locals speaking Italian but we got by very well using English:)

A little pricey but no where near the cost of a trip to the \"boot.\""}
{"text":"I should be ashamed of myself; I have lived near this restaurant since it opened but only recently tried the place. On my first visit, I tried the sausage sandwich and the leak fries. The Italian sausage sandwich is served on baguette bread with grilled onions and homemade Italian sausage. The food was excellent and nearly enough for two. The leak fries were great and served with green onions and a dipping sauce which had a trace of olive. 

While there, I saw a guest come in just for an order of freshly made bread, which looked incredible ($7.35 out the door; the loaf was huge). 

Prior to leaving, I ordered their two most popular deserts: the tiramisu and pistachio cake. Both were AWESOME; however, I thought the tiramisu was just slightly better. 

I will be back; perhaps tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Andreolis looks great on dinners & drive ins & dives, but it is very over priced for what it is. Had proccutto and supposedly fresh made mozzarella. In reality it was one paper thin piece of proccutto and little piece of crumbled cheese, definitely not home made. Sandwich was very over price for what it was.not happy & will never go back.feel ripped off."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times in the past to carryout. Tonight was our first dining experience. I knew they would be busy, we came knowing we might have to wait for a table. In fact at 6pm the place was full and no tables available inside....no problem, looked like a few were getting ready to open up. A man was sitting alone at a large table, we had 5 in our party. As a table opened up we asked a staff member if maybe they can ask him, if he was waiting for a large group and if not maybe he can take a smaller table. He moved and we were able to sit soon after arriving. I did notice one staff member seemed very irritated with our seating arrangement. I asked her there was a problem and she proceeded to tell me that it was and she was working on it and we needed to wait. I apologized if anyone was rude in my group (knowing it not to be the case) but she was put off and that was not the intent of the request.

We ordered and sat waiting, noticing that there were many regulars, getting served bread, drinks, all sorts of attention and our group was not. My husband asked twice for bread before it arrived. Maybe I was having \"regular customer envy\". BUT, we were the new guys not really feeling the love to want to become a regular. All that being said. The food is amazing, and our foodie selves will be back. Maybe if we go enough....we can be treated like the cool kids....or at least get bread."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place. ALL of the cakes are excellent, moist, not too sweet, just like in Italy. My first time in I stocked up on grocery items and when I got home thought I must have forgotten to ask for olive oil. When I returned the next week they immediately said, \"We owe you an olive oil.\" They'd accidentally left it out of my bag. THAT is customer service. 

Olives, giardiniera, fresh bread, bufala, it's all excellent. 

Planning to return for dinner this week."}
{"text":"Only Italy has equally as good food!  Hands down, the best and most authentic Italian food I have ever had anywhere! That includes New York, Chicago, and LA. No filler, no crap, just great freaking food!  A MUST go!"}
{"text":"Three of us dined at Android tonight. Congolese for me, no flavor. Gnocchi for my wife over cooked,  Rigatoni & sausage for my client. Al denote is one thing, these were not cooked. Grainy & hard. Nobody asked us how our meals were, arrogance rules. There are 5 different restaurants in a 3 mile area that are all superior to Andreoli .
Coffee & a slice of cake is probably your best bet.
Ciao"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian! Very authentic and fresh ingredients. We had the porchetta and eggplant park sandwhich, as well as the calamari. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible service was terrible we ordered cake after dinner and waited 20 minutes because they forgot!!! I got the shrimp pasta which was good but it was 28 dollars for a total of 6 shrimp really!!! My sister got the Rigatony which was good and more reasonable at 16 dollars... Will not return !!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst eggplant parmesan sandwich is the history of this item. The one star extra is for decent bread, but the filling was inedible. They decide to strip the eggplant down to the skins and then put all the skins in the sandwich. Next, they take all the seedings and eggplant meat and also throw that into this sandwich disaster. Top it off with mozzarella cheese and charge you $9 for the privledge of eating a horrible concoction. Nothing is fried, nothing is mentioned how they would be spitting on the fine history of the egplant parm sandwich in their version. Wilted lettuce as your side dish and there you go - enjoy your lousy lunch. Ripoff city. Should have walked out when they said that they don't have a chicken parmesan sandwich...hello it's an Italian joint. Whatever part of Italy this place represents, avoid it on vacation."}
{"text":"Soooooo 2 years later since I wrote my review, & their service STILL SUCKS!!!  I hear people from my work who have visited (I still refuse to return to this place) & again, they are asked to move from their tables, only to observe 1 person being seated at 4-6 person table.  They still won't add or subtract condiments or cheese.  I don't know how they stay open.  I really wish they would read these reviews & understand they are not well received by the company I work for, which has about 200 employees at our office.  As I said before, word travels fast & people have a bad taste in their mouth from Andreoli's.  It's the same story over & over.  These folks are real jerks."}
{"text":"In Scottsdale on business for a few 2 days, ate lunch here both days.

The best Italian sandwiches I've had in a while -- fresh prosciutto, mozarella, anything you could want. Each sandwich comes with a small house salad. 

The store itself has a great vibe, great for eating there or taking out. 

I will certainly be coming back here next time I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would. The food is decent but service means a lot to me and my group of friends. The way we were treated by the owner's daughter was simply despicable. She was simply rude and should never be in the service industry. Will never eat there again and will spread the word.
This place is over priced- and the service is beyond rude after spending $170 for 4 people I don't expect a standing ovation but a simple have a great day would have been ok....."}
{"text":"My son's office is only 5mns drive from this place and he invited me today for lunch. I am from France and I love Italy, speak Italian and enjoy the Italian food in general. I have lived 36 years in the States and to find authentic Italian cooking in the SouthWest can sometimes be a challenge. 

I was happy to find out that Andreoli had carpaccio as it is my favorite and it was so delicious. 
I was so glad to taste a carpaccio without heavy olive oil nor capers on it! The shaved parmesan cheese on top is all what you need to enhance the carpaccio of beef. There is a nice light salad under the meat and it is exactly like you get in Italy or France, no tomatoes, nor cucumbers or other veggies like in American salads. It is simple, light with just a drizzle of oil and vinegar but oh so good! For dessert I had the tiramisu cake and it was the best I ever had even in Italy! It melts in the mouth. My son had the Zuppa cake which also was fantastic. His pork sandwich was amazingly tasty. I got a Sicilian pastry to go and I couldn't resist but eat it at home, wow! Great taste, not too sweet, crunchy outside and smooth inside with a cheese, lemon paste. 
My son had already tried the pasta dishes and said they were fantastic. So although Andreoli is a bit far from where I live in the Valley I will make multiple trips to try more dishes in the future, this being my first time. 

To answer some unfair other reviews, as far as the price goes it is NOT expensive for fresh and truly tasty food, I believe that it would be more expensive in a large Italian city for similar dishes! To get that type of food I'd rather go without any trip to Starbucks or another medium of the range restaurant that in my opinion are overpriced no matter what you get because in general the food is so Americanized (bland or chemically enhanced)! My apologies (not) to all the US fast food or chain restaurants that litter the Valley of the Sun! 

The service was fast and very friendly, I can't understand how some reviewers said they had to wait a long time! It must have been a particularly busy time or someone exaggerating!

I realize that the food served there is very Italian and the portions are just like in Italy not more not less, so don't expect any American humongous portions, yet to me it's just right and the food is fresh, no chemicals nor coloring added to enhance the flavors like so many American restaurants, especially fast food! When you eat at Andreoli's you don't feel overstuffed, it's so digestible. VIVA ITALIA! 

Molte grazie Giovanni for a wonderful experience and the decor is also very Italian! It's exciting to find such a place! Arivederci!"}
{"text":"Walked in and only 1 table was busy . We seated ourselves and waiter came we ordered drinks and was told to get them from cooler. Upon ordering our food they didn't have anything we had saw from pics  to order Meatballs were not going to be ready till Tuesday No ravioli cooked just frozen very disappointed came from New Mexico"}
{"text":"Great food and great staff pretty expensive and the portion sizes are small but nice place, seating is limited and they get busy."}
{"text":"I wanted to add a bit to my husband's review. I ordered the spaghetti and clams, one of their more expensive dishes. There were a nice number of clams on the plate but the sauce was watery and tasteless."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dinner so much, I came back the next night to take more home. I love the family running this little gem, and appreciate the quality and freshness of their food. The penne with veal sauce was great, and the tiramisu was some of the best I've eaten. Looking forward to trying more the next time I visit my Mom."}
{"text":"DeFalcos was the king.

Since I found Andreolis my life has changed.  Fresh baked bread, finest cuts of meats, and hand made pastas.  It does not get any better than this.  I had not tasted good balsamic vinegar and olive oil till I had some at Andreolis (granted a good bottle of olive oil will cost you upwards of $50).  

I have been to Andreolis a few different times now and each time I go I have to try something new.  Usually when you go to a place there are one or two good things to eat on the menu.  Not so at Andreolis.  As my fellow foodie Pete likes to say \"it is a check list not a menu\".  I have had sandwiches, salads, bread and meat trays, but the crown jewel is their raviolis.  As an example I ordered their mushroom ravs one day and they were out.  Michael (the owners son) comes out to my table and lets me know but tells me they have taken care of me.  When my plate arrives he lets me know that they made me some pumpkin ravs instead.  My heart drops in my shoes because I hate all things pumpkin.  But, I grin and bare it knowing that everything else I have tried here is top notch.  I take my first bite and a large smile comes over my face.  The ravs were so good I wanted to cry.  Every bite I could taste the hint of truffle oil, the butter that was mixed in, and slight tinge of sage.  The pumpkin filling was so good I wanted to go to my moms house and slap her for making such god awful pumpkin pies growing up and making me think pumpkin was an evil squash.

Andreolis is not some fancy upscale establishment, so if you are looking for cultured you are coming to the wrong place.  What Andreolis is though is a great Italian deli that serves great food using fresh imported Italian ingredients.  If you are in Scottsdale stop by and order the ravs.  Your stomach and palette will thank you."}
{"text":"I feel odd leaving a 2 star review when so many people really love this place.

So ordered 2 entrees- the gnocchi in a vodka cream sauce and the penne with veal ragu.  So I'm wondering what went wrong here....the gnocchi was just plain tasting, no pizzaz to the sauce, no hint of any real flavors except tomato sauce that seemed watered down.  It was good but for $16 or $17 dollars I sort of expected above average.

Now the veal penne- pasta was cooked perfectly.  And it stops there....the sauce was not enough to really cover or be spread around all the noodles and again, where was that veal taste with hints or spice, tomatoes etc?  Missing like the gnocchi.  Had to ask for a side of Parmesan since the pasta was lacking even a good sprinkling of cheese.

Bread was slightly cold, not warm so great, can it get more annoying.....

So at that point I thought a homemade piece of tiramisu would do the trick.  Okay at this point I said \"you have to be \"bleeping\" kidding me.\"  I would say it was an order of whipped cream with some lady fingers included.  Literally 65% whipped cream that was actually good, won't take that away from them, but the dessert isn't a moose, it's lady fingers.  Tasted the mascarpone cheese, but no taste of coffee liquor, or anything but mascarpone whipped cream.

So disappointed and even more disappointed it costs over $50.00 (had 2 glasses of wine, in small glasses) what tastes slightly better than the Olive Gardens.  

And don't charge $7.00 for whipped cream!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered Thru door dash. Got the eggplant parm, and the prosciutto with mozzarella and peppers. The eggplant was tasty, and unique. Would rate 4 out of 5. The prosciutto was so dam good I'd give it a 6 out of 5 hence the review"}
{"text":"Simply amazing.  Great food. Especially for lunch. Try the roast beef. Best caprese. Yum."}
{"text":"Gimmee an A...Gimme a T....Gimme a T...Gimme an I...Gimme a T...Gimme a U...Gimme a D....Gimme an E...what does it spell?  ATTITUDE!

This review is not for the food, but for the attitude we experienced at Andreoli's.  

As visitors to Scottsdale we were looking for a place to pick up talian specialty and deli items and two options, Andreoli's' being one, popped to the top of our list.  Since my hubby is Italian American and grew up in an Italian neighborhood in Brooklyn, he has more than a passing acquaintance with good italian deli's and \"attitude\".  Loves the former and the latter doesn't phase him a bit.  Usually.  But at Andreoli's he walked out without making a purchase.  Here's why...

We were the only customers in the store at about 6pm on a weeknight, so it's not as if they were too busy or we were too impatient.  But we waited for some time before a staff person, who had just been complaining - loudly - to someone else about a rude customer - asked \"You know what you want?\"  When we said we were new to the store and trying to decide the response was roughly, \"When you figure out what you want call me, I'll be in the back.\"

You know that old comic phrase, \"This job would be great if it weren't for our damned customers\"...well, we wonder if that' might be the slogan at Andreoli's based on this single experience.   

That said, it seems as if Andreoli's has a decent selection of deli items (although not as good as  one of their competitors perhaps) and a great selection of imported Italian specialty items, like taralles, capers packed in salt, nougats and so on, and a freezer case full of ravioli with different fillings that looked pretty darned intriguing. 

So, we wondered, why was the place empty at about 6:00 on a weeknight when one might think people should be coming and going to pick things up to take home or eat in?   Maybe we're not the only ones who decided the attitude wasn't worth it?

We left without making a purchase.  But given all the great Yelp reviews, maybe we just hit this on a bad day.  Still, we'd echo Jan S's observation in her review from her experience in December that there is a sense the staff doesn't care.  And in this economy in particular, we want to do business with people who do."}
{"text":"This place is amazing atmosphere is beautiful felt like I was in Italy very delicious sandwiches bread is amazing salad is amazing you all must come try this place!!!!! When visiting arizona again totally coming back found this place on diners drive ins and dives"}
{"text":"Their rigatoni was good.  They didn't provide extra cheese to add on top. Would say that was a missing touch."}
{"text":"Firstly, save room for a pastry!  Great sandwiches.  Bread is home made and is fantastic.  It was busy when we got there but the line moved quickly.  I had the Speck and I'll have it again.  Next time I'll bring a few pastries for the road. Chocolate croissant was fantastic!  Thanks to DDD for turning me on to this place!"}
{"text":"Here is the good news:

The frozen ravioli (that you take home and cook) is very good

Here is the bad news:

The price is absurd ... $17 for a small batch that barely feeds 1.5 people

What is up with these people? ...  How much more would it cost them to add 40% more product for the $17 price point?

Think I'm wrong ... walk in and check the frozen section ... the pricing is too high for the tiny bit of product they are providing ... they need to be more generous ...

The ravioli is good, but it isn't that good ...

otherwise, really a nice product ... Nice energy inside as well."}
{"text":"Bad service, orders some fish pasta was plain and bland and not good at all. They said it was a particular taste like I didn't know it tasted like bland Ragu with old fish sauce. This place is a wanna be old school gangster Italian food but is shitty attitudes."}
{"text":"Italian food, cooked and served by Italians with Italian ingredients. What else do you want? Best Italian restaurant in Arizona IMO."}
{"text":"I'm a true believer that Andreoli has some of the most authentic Italian food in the Valley! Their food is SO fresh and delicious and I completely recommend sharing the dishes family style so that you can get a little taste of everything. And their bread, Oh-Em-Gee, their bread. I could eat it all day, every day and be a happy camper (Ask for some balsamic to go along with their fabulous EOO)! A few of my favorites are the maresciallo (meat and cheese board), fratelli d'italia (caprese-like salad) and their pasta options change frequently but they are all amazing!  Last but certainly not least, their sweet treats are off of the charts. I love their Nutella cookies and chocolate cake! Warning: The photos may make your mouth instantly start watering! :) Enjoy!! Can't wait to come back soon."}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews, and now my curiosity has me... I HAVE TO GO. Read the good and the bad, but I didn't think the bad would effect me, so I drive over with an open mind and a empty stomach. Yes I'm from the East Coast and spent many days of my life in Little Italy, and yes I've even been to Italy a few times too. 

Meh. I've experienced better.

The shelves were sparse for a \"Grocer\" and limited, the food was fresh but I can do better in my own kitchen for a whole lot cheaper. Andreoli is EXPENSIVE ... I know, I know, it's Scottsdale. The tables were filled with regulars that make this their home, and I had to sit outside to smell their lovely garbage cooking in the hot desert sun. Not appetizing! When placing my order I was treated very coldly and with their great attitude, that I read previous in others reviews, was true."}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out for the first time.  I chose to get a few things for dinner, all to go.  After paying $70+, I looked around and checked out the products displayed to see if I recognized anything authentic.  We go to Italy once a year and I am quite familiar with the language as well as the food.  After fifteen minutes, I politely asked about my order.  A young gentleman snickered and said something in Italian which all the \"young\" attendants laughed and even clapped at his response.  I understood them all completely.  I wasn't huffing or puffing or upset where my food was.  I simply inquired, politely.  First time is not a charm for this place.  Customer service is a huge thing in the restaurant business.  This place, just doesn't have it.  I will never go back here again.  And, I will make sure that word gets around."}
{"text":"We arrived there for lunch and it was very busy!  My husband HATES ordering and then sitting down but to my surprise, he really liked this place!  All the staff was very nice from the gentlemen who took our order, the gentlemen that rung us up and the one who brought our food.  The food was extremely delicious!  We all (4 of us) got something different from the fried calamari, rigatoni bean soup, Tizio (sausage) sandwich and the Abuffino (spicy calabrese) sandwich.  My sister kinda grimaced when her calamari did not come with a dipping sauce and the salad only came with the oil and vinegar.  The calamari was so delicious it did not need a sauce.  And the salads (served with the sandwiches) is amazing!  Fresh and tasty!  We will defanitly return!"}
{"text":"Fun little hole in the wall. Food was tasty, egg plant sub. Enjoyed the cannoli for something sweet. Pizza slices looked yummy, will give them a try next time I'm in that area."}
{"text":"Andreoli is a little gem we discovered through yelp while on vacation in scottsdale. My daughter loves her Nona's pasta and an authentic italian meal so we decided to give this place a try. Our kids had spaghettini in a plain tomato sauce. My husband and I split the bresaola and arugula salad with Parmesan and a plate of pasta with veal sausage. The meal was delicious. Very authentic and flavourful. The sandwiches that we saw others eating alos looked very good - on fresh ciabatta bread. It reminded us of meals we eat in Italy or at my italian in-laws' place. 

We also had dessert. The pastries and espresso are excellent. 

We ate around 2pm on a Friday and the place wasn't too crowded. The owner was socializing with patrons and thee was a friendly vibe. 

The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because the prices for the pasta (over $20) seem high for an establishment where you order at a counter. 

Decor is quaint and traditional with antique style table and chairs. It has a very family-run type feel which is nice."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have not reviewed Andreoli's before.  I have been having their sandwiches and Chocolate croissants since the twins were born.  Andreoli is so close to the Scottsdale Shea Hospital.  When I delivered the twins I had to stay there for I think 4 or 5 days.  I sent my hubby everyday for chocolate croissants and sandwiches.  Hospital food is yuck compared to it.  
I went back again today, I needed some comfort food after the stress of my little girls surgery, hey I need an excuse for the carb overload. 
I ordered the Porchetta and the Forza Italia, plus of course a couple of chocolate croissants, 1/3 of a pound of salami and some Zuppa inglese for an additional dessert.
The food here is amazing, yes, the customer service is not the best.  They remind me of my Zio Aldo.  Always with his smug smile and always telling everyone around how \"stupido\" they are.  I miss him.  You need to think like George Costanza, not make any sudden moves or comments for fear you will get \"No croissant for you, one year!\""}
{"text":"How is this place not a 5 star rating on YELP!?!  My god I've been to Venice, Florence, and Rome and to have a place like Andreoli so close to home oh boy I love it here.  The food is amazing each sandwich is made of home made bread, the freshest ingredients....wow I love it here.  This is authentic italian at its very best and I hope they are around for as long as I am :)"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, great house wine, great service, friendly Italian speaking environment! We are wowed!"}
{"text":"I've had this restaurant bookmarked for a while, so I went to check it out finally. It was a bit of a drive from my home but it was worth the experience.

We had never been there so it was nice to find a cute Italian grocer with decent food. I say decent I guess because I was thinking the food would be more flavorful. 
We ordered two sandwiches. I thought I was ordering a tuna sandwich but I basically got a Caprese. Pretty standard, except that the bread was soooo good and buttery. My mom said her sandwich lacked flavor but the bread was good as well. 

It really was the bread that was impressive for both of us. 
It seems as though they have really good food here aside from sandwiches. It's a bit pricey though. 

What made the experience nice was one of the workers who had the greatest personality. He was humble and spoke mostly Italian but a little English. 

The young lady at the counter was not friendly, but it was this guy who spoke mostly Italian who asked us if it was our first time and made some dessert recommendations. Another worker made some sandwich recommendations. If it wasn't for these two men, I would've felt completely isolated and unwelcome in this establishment, so I'm really glad they were there to be helpful, even though it's not their primary job.

I get it's your family's restaurant, but if you don't want to be there, don't be there. People can tell and this restaurant could be even greater with better service."}
{"text":"My favorite semi-secret lunch spot. Truly an Italian grocery store that sells food. The bald trier own breads so it is worth getting a sandwich to enjoy the bread. Most items come standard with an excellent side salad. After two years I am still trying to force myself to skip
A favorite and try yet another menu item. 
It is OK if I see you there but do help keep this place s semi-secret. It is not all that large and I don't want to be waiting in kind in the parking log. Just saying - it is so good that that could happen"}
{"text":"Italian food that feels authentic and family-run. Wednesday is pizza day. Homemade prosciutto everyday. Yeah yeah yeah!

I came here on a Monday with my mom who comes here often. We had the arugula and burrata salad, Italian fries, branzino, grilled calamari, and for dessert tiramisu and decaf cappuccinos.

Everything was literally yum.com. The salad was fresh and creamy, the branzino cooked to perfection and yummy, the calamari is seasoned really nicely. The tiramisu is just the right amount of creamy and the Capuccino was delicious. You have to try the Italian fries. They come with this amazing dipping sauce.

No reservations here. You order at the counter, sit with your number, and they serve you. When you are done you take your number to the register and pay. 

The service is excellent. You can also shop some authentic Italian items and take the meats, pastas, and desserts home.

When in scottsdale visit this gem!"}
{"text":"Great overall experience. I strolled in tonight, a first timer not really knowing much about the finer points of charcuterie.  I was greeted kindly by the guy behind the deli cooler. I asked him to give me a half a pound of his spiciest salami and a baguette.  I planned on taking this home to make a great sandwich.  While my order was being sliced, I wandered around the store looking at all of the great italian food products. Pastas, olives, breadsticks, pastries, you name it, it was all there. 

Long story short, I got home about ready to make my sandwich, and tried a slice of the salami. Incredible! There was no way in hell I was going to put this inside two slices of bread and dilute the flavor with mustard, mayo, cheese, etc... Instead, I  sliced up the baguette, grabbed some brie, and made myself a mini smorgasbord. The salami ruled the day. The bread wasn't bad either.  I can't wait to go back for lunch and try some cheese and bresaola or maybe a full sandwich."}
{"text":"I'm never sure, if I come here for the atmosphere or the food. 

I would say that atmosphere edges out food slightly, but not by much. Their sandwiches during lunch time are delicious. I know folks like to come here for dinner, but for me it's more interesting and manageable during lunch. 

Sometimes the TV is tuned to an Italian football game and a group of older men rant and rave at every play.  Other times, it's just the family and employees having fun with each other.  Free entertainment.  

Now don't forget to take some cookies for home. They are delicious!  Expect to pay $10 to $15 for a good lunch. No tipping required. Mangia!"}
{"text":"The food was great. the patio was great. the staff was great. i thought the prices were a little high. We enjoyed it and would return."}
{"text":"Was a pleasant visit. No smiles---but the food was GREAT and we got things fast.

I was chilled ---it had been raining and appeared they turned the heat on late."}
{"text":"One of the BEST chocolate croissants I have ever tasted!  I visited this morning in search of a snack and the owner said I had to taste one of his freshly baked croissants...OMG, he wasn't kidding how good they were!  Nice selection of sandwiches, meats and cheeses too!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Italian food around.  Their pizza is just delighful and perfect.  The pasta with meat and peas sounded gross to me at first until I tried it one and now I am hooked!  

The only reason I give it 4 stars because the service can sometimes be a little off and it is a bit expensive.  Other than that I enjoy this place immensely."}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch with some colleagues...never had heard of this place so didn't have any expectations.

I've never been to Italy, but I've been to Little Italy in San Diego so I feel like I had the credentials to adequately wax on the wonder of Andreoli's.  The second you step in, you're gonna feel like that you're in an authentic Italian environment. Sauces, coffee, bread, and oils adorn the walls and fill the restaurant/grocery store with products that also provide for some pretty awesome decor.

This is one of those places where the mantra is \"my way or the highway.\" They make the food and you will eat it. No one really smiles or seems to be outgoing, but really all that matters is that they care about their food. 

I ordered the #2 aka The Caio...which is thinly sliced pieces of beef, melted provolone, and sauteed onions. on a soft baguette. Medium sized sandwich that will fill you and leave you with a satisfied smile. The beef is thinly tender with the perfect amount of warmth and full of taste. The side salad  is fresh and light.

Just an amazing sandwich....which is exactly what I was hoping for when I saw that it cost $8.25. The sandwich is worth every penny and I can't wait to go back to try their dessert.  I also tried the leeks, which was basically the french fries and they weren't super crispy, but these are definitely worth sharing among friends. 

Lunch for two is gonna run at least $20."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and really have never been disappointed. The food is absolutely fantastic. The restaurant reminds me of something you would find in Italy. Family owned and operated. They are not interested in being fancy. They are interested in serving fantastic food. You cannot miss here."}
{"text":"Tried this place due to the hype.   Very very disappointed with the food;  our dinner was over priced for a deli/grocer with no service.  We like our pasta al dente but our rigatoni and penne pasta were way under cooked.  My husband asked for extra sauce and were told there's no extra sauce available.  He realized it was veal sauce and offered to pay for it and again were told its not available. The gentleman and lady who set next to us were the owners.  Very rude, arrogant and obnoxious.   We had to sit through our dinner listening to their conversation and him directing/bossing  the staff to service him."}
{"text":"We started out with two appetizers, the tomato caprese and fried calamari.  For the caprese they used grape tomatoes, EV olive oil & basil over the cheese.  It was just average.  It needed a drizzle of vinaigrette with Roma tomatoes, not grape.   The fried calamari was horrible. Overcooked, barely breaded (more like a dusting) and didn't come with a marinara for dipping.  It came with a side salad which doesn't make sense as a pairing.  The sandwiches were made with a nice combo of fresh meats and flavorful bread.  I had the sausage with peppers & provolone.  They use freshly ground sausage and flattened it on the grill top vs. using links.  Loved it.  My wife & friend ordered the pasta with sausage & peas.  Very good.  The pasta was cooked perfectly.  My friend's wife had the seafood platter.  She didn't eat much of it.  I would stick with the sandwiches or pasta dishes.  The service was very slow.  They have one TV in there and it was on an Italian speaking soccer channel.  We were the only table in there at the time and asked if we could watch the hockey playoffs.  They couldn't figure out how to find the channel so my friend's sister showed them how to do a search and found it.  15 minutes later the chef/owner comes out from the kitchen and put his Italian soccer back on at a high obnoxious volume.  He got up and went back to the kitchen and didn't switch it back to the game we were watching.  I think he was mad that someone thought the TV in the dining area was for the customers.  How silly of us!  They call themselves a grocer and yes, you can buy cheese & cold cuts to take with you.  They have shelves of pasta, sauces, oils, olives etc.  I checked the prices and had to chuckle.  For example, they have bottles of Giardinara marked at $11.99 that you can buy at Portillo's or the supermarket for about $3.  

We bought a bottle of the only available chardonnay and paid $30 since they didn't serve it by the glass.  They gave us tiny 4 oz. rock glasses to drink it from.  The wine probably cost them $8.  It tasted like Ripple.

While the young men that worked behind the counter or bussed the tables were very friendly & helpful, the girl that takes the orders seems unhappy to be there and doesn't greet people in a friendly way.

Bottom line is they have great potential but don't seem to have a clue on how to capitalize on it.  They lack consistency in every way.  Some food tastes great while other items are very weak.  Some prices are very fair, while others are clearly a rip off.  I was quite surprised for a Tuesday nite that they became pretty busy by the time we left.  They have obviously developed a following that I would not have expected.  If we lived nearby we'd use the place for pickup on certain dishes only.  But we won't go back."}
{"text":"Nice place for lunch.  We ordered two Italian pork sandwiches and shared them; they were great - good meat on very tasty baguettes.  Each came with a nice lettuce salad.  It's a filling lunch.  

I'm going to make a point to come back here soon as I really did enjoy it."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for lunch. The food is good, a little pricy but decent. I do have to say that when I ordered a couple desserts to take home, an older man bagged it and THREW it at the cash register. HELLO??? I'm going to spend almost 10 bucks on some goodies and you're going to throw it? WOW.

I do have to agree with other Yelpers, they really need to work on customer service and be nice to those who take time out of their day to eat at their restaurant........remember if it's good, you tell a friend, if it's bad, you tell the world."}
{"text":"I have recently found Italian BLISS and have since given birth to an Italian \"food baby\" and proudly so. I grew up in \"Little Italy\" in Toronto (boasting the largest Italian population outside Italy!!)....so let's talk salami: I was like a little kid in a candy store steaming up the charcuterie counter window....prosciutto, parma, sausages, bresaola....and so many delicacies that I can only pronounce after some Italian wine! 
Upon entering, the English language dissappeared and I was soon transported to Italy - the language, the cuisine and LIVE music!! ....Bellissima!!
I successfully made it to dessert and found happiness in sfogliatelle and soon learned the art behind every layer of phyllo. It was worth every little bit."}
{"text":"You'll have to pay a little more....don't expect a welcome mat and cheery company...order one of the daily specials.....if that works for you.....it is the most authentic best Italian food in the valley . NNNOOOO Frills...just the best."}
{"text":"I think this is the best place to get authentic Italian food in the valley. The grilled calamari was absolutely amazing and I also got a sandwich, the bread was perfect! The bus boy spoke Italian and that speaks volumes. It's a small place that's pretty far north from me, but it is absolutely worthy the drive!"}
{"text":"The food here is superbly delicioso!!!  If you like grilled calamari, then this is the place.  The calamari is marinated and tasty and has a distinct flavor that makes an individual come back for more and more and more.  One can taste vinegar with some olive oil and pepper and some spice I can't quite put a finger on.  Try their potato fries, it is so unique and crispy and served with crispy onion strips!  House salad is most tasty with just the right amount of oil and vinegar.  Pasta is of course al dente and cooked to perfection!  Place is small, plan to come before 7pm, otherwise, a takeout is always the best option.  Oh, forgot to mention the desserts, I don't know what they're called or what's in them but just try them, you won't regret it!!!  Belissimo!!!"}
{"text":"We saw Andreoli's on Triple D and had it on our list of places to go. We love authentic Italian and have a place in Scottsdale I have been going to for 45 years which was also on Triple D. 
We came up from Chandler and were so hungry! Love the different tables and chairs with a real Italian feel and decorations. There was a table full of what looked like family members and chefs/employees, near the register and it confused us as to where we order.
The young man at the counter was super helpful and we ordered 3 sandwiches and the fries with leeks. Total bill for 3 people for lunch was $36. OK, I guess. The place was nearly empty but we waited quite a bit for our food.
I had the salami, cheese and olive sandwich which was small with a small sliver of cheese, and 4 circles of salami. The rolls were delicious but I would think you could get a little more meat and cheese than that. The quality is excellent without question but it just wasn't anything I would come back to if we weren't in the area. It felt like we were outsiders and not very welcome.
The fries with fried leek were outstanding! This is the only reason I gave 3 stars instead of 2.
We will go back to our favorite place in Scottsdale but wish Andreoli's well."}
{"text":"Don't go unless you are part of the \"familia\" or enjoy bring ignored. We were at Andreoli on Saturday night and the staff was very busy taking care of a small number of tables of friends.  We were totally ignored.  

When we tried to order pizza we were told that there are no more pizza, but I saw pizzas being delivered to the \"right\" tables even an hour or so later.  

Unlike previous visits the food this time was mediocre. No one bothered to ask us if we wanted coffee or dessert. In short, we felt unwanted. 

Not going back!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Loved the prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich. Cake was amazing. Pricing was decent. Four of us went and we were all pleased."}
{"text":"Yes, another Italian deli/grocer review.  While visiting family in the area we stopped here for an early lunch. 

It was a party of eight, the place was somewhat empty so we had time to catch up.  I asked the people I was with what they recommended and we came up with two sandwiches.

The first sandwich was on the daily specials menu.  It was a meatball hero which was very good and reminded me of Sunday Dinner at Grandma's. The second sandwich was the #6 the Porchetta. Which is roasted pork seasoned with garlic, fennel and black pepper.  Both came with a side salad.   

The total cost for two drinks and two sandwiches came to about $25 which is a little high, but I think the food was worth it. 

Just an observation, it seems like there are a lot more Italian delis in the Scottsdale area since the last time I was out there.  I don't think that is a bad thing is it?  It is just an awful amount of competition."}
{"text":"We live in the SF Bay Area & come to Scottsdale 1-2 times per year to see my wife's family. I checked online (Yelp & Trip Advisor) & found the positive reviews and 4 1/2 stars for Italian restaurants & with Andreoli I liked the menu and the fact that the owner & cook are native born Italians. I'm not but my heart and soul are very Italian as my parents are born in Italy where we go every year, food a main reason and it is no place for a diet. Many places in North Beach ( Little Italy in SF), and in Italy too in Piazza Navona, Pantheon etc., have barkers outside enticing people to come in while you prefer some space looking at the outside menu. These are mostly tourists whom many they'll see only once. I hate the hounding. This is a neighborhood place off the busy streets and not a major tourist area like Old Town Scottsdale and is mostly a destination point restaurant and I would guess that most of their customers are repeat so for customers to return, the food has to be good !


So many Italian restaurants have Latins as cooks and these are trained by Italians but for me I'm a bit biased and find that an authentic native born Italian in the kitchen will make me feel more like I'm in Italia and Luciano most certainly did cooking our meals on 2 visits. If they have the ingredients, and they do have so many and imported from Italy too, they'll make something to order. Had Linguini & Clams but it was in a white sauce with a little white wine and olive oil and I asked for it in red but light so Luciano cut up 4-5 cherry tomatoes. On another day I had a taste for Pasta alla Puttanesca, a specialty plate of the Ladies of the Night. I looked in the case and saw Anchovies, Olives and Capers so Luciano made it for me again with the sliced Cherry tomatoes, garlic & olive oil. The Spaghetti was cooked to order and \"al dente\", chewy to the taste. Some restaurants overcook the pasta and it comes like Polenta, Italian cornmeal. In Italy there is an expression \" Fare La Scarpetta\" (little shoe). The bread is used to scoop up the sauce and we were doing that frantically. Many in Italia consider \"La Scarpetta\" the best part of the meal.

My father was born in Cetraro, Italia, and I delighted in having the Cetrarese salad from that region without greens but mixed olives, tomatoes and onions. I saw another salad my Mother used to make with tomatoes, tuna and mixed greens but my Mama would served it with Cannellini beans & no lettuce which I will ask them to do next time we are in the area. I asked if they do Pasta & Fagioli and they do so this will be something for which to look forward.

Very luckily, one day a birthday for a teenage boy was being celebrated where he was given a delectable looking \"torta\"(cake). Also, Gianni's grandaughter, Isabella, was there and it was a festive atmosphere of Italian family and friends. I got nostalgic & felt I was with my family. Many Italians even when you meet them for the first time make you feel like family as I'm sure they do with many customers. And continuing the Italian authenticity, the one TV had the RAI channel and what do Italians love as much as good food, SOCCER !!! And while enjoying eachother's company, eyes glanced at the match.

People in this area are lucky and if you can't make a trip to Italy now, come here as you'll feel like you are in Italy. If I lived in the area I'd be here 3-4 times per week. And they have \"un sacco di selezioni di panino\", wonderful assortment of sandwiches, and as I said about the pasta dishes, if they have the ingredients, I'm sure will make them to order. I noticed too a steady line of people taking sandwiches( I'm thinking now of one I wish to have when I return, homemade sausages, peppers & onions...yum, yum !!!) to go which I would too do on a regular basis along with many other \"prelibatezze alimentari\", Italian delicacies. As they say about returning to Sorrento, I can't wait to return to Andreoli's on our next trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I always have to hit Andreoli when I'm in town. It's like escaping to Italy for a couple hours. Seriously, most times I've been there I am the only person who speaks English natively. The menu consists mainly of sandwiches, salads and starters, then there's a specials board that changes daily, including entrees and pastas. 

This last visit, we stopped in on Pizza Night, which is every Friday and pretty delicious. We were seated in front of the outdoor pizza oven, which proved to be the best dinner theatre ever! Giovanni, the owner, was fired up hotter than the oven itself. Yelling at the staff and his daughter in Italian, which I fortunately speak, so I was able to understand everything they said. They were screaming about running out of pizza, which happens every Friday. Lucky us: we got one of the last pies. Mushroom and sausage. It was up to par with all the rest of their outstanding fare. 

We also enjoyed a pasta bolognese, which is a regular item on the special board. Andreoli puts out the best bolognese in the city. Hands down. 

Other items I suggest:
1. The steak sandwich, kinda like an Italian Cheese Steak. Unreal. Steak. Fontina. Need I say more?
2. Anything made with their housemade sausage. 
3. The speck sandwich. Not too heavy, great flavors from the smokey pork, blue cheese and arugula. 
4. If you have a big group, have them make you an impressive antipasto plate. Yum. 
5. Artichokes
6. Tiramisu. OMG. Save room.

Also, I'd suggest bringing your own wine. Corkage is pretty cheap and their selection is just OK. The cheapest bottle you can get is $30 and is really lackluster. Oh, and never ask for any substitutions. They will not accomodate, but the food is amazing and should be enjoyed as they make it."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food! The service here is also fantastic. They hand bake their bread every day. We have been here several times and it never disappoints. The Caio sandwich is tender and comes with the best oil and vinegar topped salad you will ever have. The mushroom ravioli is also excellent along with the penne and veal Ragu. They also sell a great selection of imported Italian products. Great desserts too!"}
{"text":"Bravo!  The wood-fired Pizza oven is an awesome addition as well as the extra patio seating. As always pastas are cooked al dente perfectly. and the cozy familia atmosphere makes this place one of my favorite neighborhood spots. Grazie  grazie"}
{"text":"Thank you, Giovanni, for helping make my son's graduation party a delicious success!
We loved sitting down to plan the menu with you...you had us laughing so hard! Our menu included antipasto, Tuscan bread, Italian butter, salad with white anchovies on the side, their house made gnocchi, pasta with broccoli and pasta with veal bolognaise sauce. And the desserts... amazing!  Their tiramisu is light and fluffy and beautiful! The order was ready on time, packaged perfectly with plenty of serving plates, etc. Cater your next event from Andreolis and go to eat there as well any night! You will need to go many times to try everything on the menu!!
Highly recommend!! :)"}
{"text":"I am the type of person that almost always orders 1 thing from each place I eat lunch, allowing me to mix up the location.

I say this because the 'Cosa Nostra' sandwich is why I come here. I don't need to try anything else because I enjoy it that much, every time. 

It's also got a lot of cool unique Italian fares for take home, and the employees seem really nice..."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this place being traditional, but after eating here once, my boyfriend and I are hooked. The food is either locally grown/farmed or imported from Italy! The glass cases in front of the shop house an amazing selection of aged/dried meats and cheeses, pastries and chocolate. The menu consists of sandwiches, salads, and specials (mostly soups and pasta dishes). I believe I remember the owner mentioning something about pizza on a certain day of the week. 

This place is always packed at lunchtime, so come early and grab a table. There is a patio to use if it's nice outside. The \"market\" part is small, but it seems like the goods are pretty fancy. 

The service is fast and accommodating. They won't kiss your ass, but they get the job done! The interior is dim and resembles what I would say is a traditional old country kitchen. Very rustic. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Simply awesome place, one of the two best Italian restaurants I've ever been to anywhere.  Service is fast and efficient, and the food...simply phenomenal.  The bread is perfectly fresh every time.  The salad dressing, while rather simple, is surprisingly great for some reason I can't put my finger on.  We've always loved it.

The dining area is very small with just simple tables, and there's a small patio area.  I've never had to wait for seating however.  They don't have any sort of a bar but there's a selection of a few wines by the bottle at a reasonable price.

Note the name is \"Italian Grocer\" and their roots are in selling some great deli meats, bread, and ready-to-use home-made pastas.  You can get top quality meat and bread to go as well as a variety of their pastas and sauces."}
{"text":"Where to begin?

How about the fact that it looks and feels like an old time neighborhood Italian Grocery Store or Delicatessen, with tables in the middle of the store? You know, the kind where the Proprietor kept track of what your family owed him in a spiral notebook. If you grew up where I did, you probably had at least one of these. I was lucky in that my neighborhood had two, but neither was as good as Andreoli's!

How about the fact that they have a Regular Menu and a Special Board every day and I have NEVER had anything I didn't like or absolutely love, after more than a dozen visits?

How about the fact that I have pretty much narrowed down my choices on each visit to one Appetizer (Have had almost all the sandwiches and they are great but too filling to have anything else) and a \"Special?\"

How about the fact that on each visit I absolutely MUST HAVE the Italian Bread with Extra Virgin Olive Oil (have to order - it's a \"Deli!\")? Absolutely the very best Italian Bread I have had since leaving the East Coast. A bit expensive but I take a loaf (BIG!) home, slice it, put paper towels between the slices, put all in a plastic bag in my freezer. Thaws out as it went it! Delicious!

How about the fact that going with friends allows you to have more \"tastes\" by ordering lots of different dishes?

How about the fact that the folks behind the counter (specially the young Lady) are knowledgeable, friendly and very helpful?

How about the fact I have NEVER been for Dinner but friends who have say it is just as terrific as lunch?

How about the fact that the Pricing for \"Specials\" may be a little steep (especially the Seafood Specials) but the quality is absolutely First Class and almost all are well worth the price?

How about the fact that I can't list my recommendations, as it would just be a restatement of the Menu, but have the \"Fries?\"

I guess I have not only started, but have finished as well."}
{"text":"We have been to andreolis several times now and will definitely be lifers!! The atmosphere is so welcoming and family oriented, it's like a huge family dinner. The food  is spectacular. The mouth watering calamari, the light salads, unbelievably fresh fish and the pastas...yum! The desserts will keep you coming back time and time again.  My husband just likes to sit and absorb the atmosphere long after we have finished eating. We talk to other patrons at different tables who bring grandparents as well as children and everyone has a great time. By far the BEST Italian spot we've ever been to."}
{"text":"The best Italian food I've ever had in Arizona, and by no small margin. If you want the real thing, come here. Yes, you order at a counter in a place that looks like a deli. Yes, you have to go back up to the register to pay. No, it's not cheap. It just doesn't matter. Eating here is the closest thing I've found to eating in Italy in the US (and yes, I've eaten in Italy). You will not get Americanized food here. This means pasta that's actually al dente, and not swimming in sauce. Portions are not chain-restaurant gigantic. On most days I've been there, at least one table will be full of people speaking Italian. It's almost like you stepped inside a teleporter and came out at a small, local restaurant in northern Italy. 

Some people who have posted reviews of Andreoli below wouldn't know real Italian food if it hit them in the head. I'm personally happy if they go elsewhere, and I think the people who run Andreoli prefer it that way too.

In addition to the food, the deli is also first rate. They have guanciale and lardo, two things I've never seen anywhere else in Arizona. The bread is so good it will make you cry (which I do when they refuse to sell me some to take home. They won't let it go if  they are running low). The house made sausage is so good, I won't buy it anywhere else now."}
{"text":"Simply, fantastic! Authentic delicious food. Can't wait to return. I was part of a party of four. We ordered four different salads and entree and four different desserts. Every item was spectacular. Service was perfect."}
{"text":"Overpriced, under serviced and Macaroni Grill quality. I expected more because of the DDD show but, of all the places across the country I've been to- this ranks near the bottom. 

Pretty much a walk up and order and wait until they bring you the food. At that level of service I wouldn't expect Veal Scallopini to be $32 and have it arrive warm and chewy. Bread was burned. Pasta was cooked well but the veal sauce was just ordinary at $17.

Especially disappointing was hearing the famous prosciutto was sold out but I don't believe it. I think they hold it back for their regulars. What we got was a $10 antipasto plate that was paltry and pathetic. 

All in- $72 (1 beer / 1 bottle of water).
Many other low service places that offer better choices (like DeFalco's) nearby that are lower priced and taste better."}
{"text":"I am extremely torn on this one.

On one hand we tried house made finely well crafted salumi , house baked breads. These are some of the things they do really well in an authentic kind of charming little homey place. These things are clearly five star.

But if I rate honestly for the dinner at their price point I I feel I had more of a three star experience and I DO NOTE THEY MIGHT HAVE HAD AN OFF NIGHT.

We had excellent house made salumi and ordered a focaccia to try. These were very good no complaints.

For dinner I tried the branzino. ($34) It was wood fired grilled. The fish was good and fresh but might have been slightly over done because it was difficult to remove the fish from it's skin. I can't sugar coat this and I have to absolutely honest and say for a $34 dinner they were not on their game with the vegetables. If you take the time to look at my photos I think you would agree. The green beans seemed like canned but might have been fresh and really might have been old and way over cooked. The green beans had the same color as canned green beans and were falling apart all threw the other vegetables. The carrots were firm in the center but the outsides were falling apart too. Now I would be OK with this if this wasn't a $34 dollar dinner. At this price point this meal is pretty equal to what Gianfranco and what Sassi would charge for a similar dinner so I feel my plate and particularly the vegetables should have been a similar quality.

My husband went with the Veal Chop. ($36) The veal was pounded thin like what you do for Milanese. The veal itself was good until you got to the bone and by the bone you couldn't eat it because it was raw there but if they cooked it more the thin veal would be over cooked. This plate had the same vegetables as mine so I don't need to explain the vegetables because you already heard it.

This is a very casual place. You order at the counter and a food runner runs your plates out. Our plates got ran to the wrong table before they made their way to us. Nobody checks on you. We waited for a check and I guess the service is European Style so when you feel your done you pay the cashier.

I'll try them again for lunch. For lunch I am certain I will have a four or five star experience but I note for lunch."}
{"text":"My food was burnt, maybe ordered the wrong thing"}
{"text":"I am so happy to have found this little gem of a restaurant again. I visited here years ago with an ex and this place has the best Italian restaurant ever. I decided to Google it and see if it was still around. I'm gonna have to pay it a visit soon. Only complaint is that my portion of food was small."}
{"text":"Fabulous. I had the penne with veal sauce.  Possibly the best pasta dish I have ever eaten. Great place, nice folks. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Bravo! Tremendous food and establishment. Made me feel like I was on vacation. Excellent homemade Italian food. If you have a problem with this place, look at yourself in the mirror and know that you are the problem. Some of these reviewers need to show some respect for a family owned restaurant where family and friends work hard to offer an authentic, delicious and comfortable dinning experience."}
{"text":"Awful. Under construction with no explanation why. Food?  Awful dry pasta no sauce. Minestrone soup not even close.   Guy  with gauzes  on his arm directing staff, while customers are looking in question. These guys have believed the reviews for too long. Go elsewhere. Staff looked Lazy no interest in customer service.  Oh... and way overpriced 

Oh and least expensive wine was $32.. really.. never again"}
{"text":"You won't find Franco American here.  Just simple, rustic, and flavorful recipes from the old country.  No heavy sauces, the flavor comes from simple preparation and quality ingredients."}
{"text":"FREEEEEKING AWESOME.  I am on a little carbohydrate high....but oh so worth it.  I actually went here on my search for a decent european pastry in the food desolation that is Scottsdale (on the recommendation of a Chowhound reviewer).  I found my pastry (admit I have no idea what I ate was called - a beautiful croissant but filled with a nutmeg custard (WHAT?!?!?!?!?!)  Omg.  I also got some of their little hazlenut cookies for the office and a slice of dark chocolate covered torrone for my hubby and a sandwhich for lunch.  Now I don't even eat meat but there are so many options here and, honestly, the charcuterie looked beautiful.  I got the buffalo mozzarella and tomato on house made foccacia.  A sandwhich so often abused and maligned by imitators - but this took things back to its farmer-to-table roots.  No heavy dressing, aioli or pesto - just amazing super soft foccacia, perfectly ripe cherry tomatoes and the lightest, fluffiest mozzarella I have ever tasted - a few slices of fresh basil and GENIUS!  I can't wait to take my husband here and, as another reviewer suggested, take advantage of their fresh pastas, olives, cheeses and other items for a home cooked italian meal too.

LOVE Andreoli!

PS I thought the young guy helping me was sweet, if informal - he didn't even make a face at my HUGE order!  Ha ha!!"}
{"text":"This food is utterly sublime. It's bursting with flavor and technique, flawless execution, gorgeous presentation.  The food is truly gourmet, in that it's generally light and fresh with decadent touches and reasonable portions (larger than usual for fancy food, smaller than usual for Italian).  

I've been here multiple times and ordered various fancy dinner specials (for example, a branzino whole fish - so tender and flavorful!) with phenomenal results.  I lived in Philly most of my life, so I can tell you that this is the real deal Italian.  

The desserts are quite delicious, but in my humble opinion, the food is better (certainly for the price).  For lunch, there aren't a ton of vegetarian options, but I've had the caprese salad -  delicious, though a bit small.

So, why not 5 stars?  The prices are high, and the quality of the food definitely supports them, but the atmosphere does not.  Don't get me wrong - there's nothing wrong with the atmosphere.  The place looks like a classic Italian grocery store with some mismatched furniture and a beautiful old espresso machine.  However, I'm a little reluctant to pay $35 per entree when I'm ordering at the counter and sitting in a stiff-backed, funky wooden chair."}
{"text":"Saw them a D.D.D. and had to come in...SOOOOOO glad I did!

Fresh baked breads, homemade pasta's and sauces and homemade AMAZING charcuterie! If you want cheap prices, Fry's Deli is right next door. If you want AMAZING flavors and REAL food done the RIGHT way, spend the extra few bucks and enjoy!

The only problem I have with this place is I want to stop in every single time I drive past...the struggle is real!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday. Empty when we got there at 11:45 AM, and packed when we left about 12:30. My friend and I each had the porchetta (pork) sandwich. The bread it was on was a 10+. Crunchy crust and pillowy inside. The pork was thinly sliced and EXTREMELY flavorful. The side salad was outstanding. The only reason I only gave it 3 stars is that I thought the cost for the portion size was very high. Actually, everything on the menu is on the pricey side. The food is outstanding, if you don't mind paying a premium for it."}
{"text":"Had lunch today.  Really good quality food.  Husband had the lamb sandwich and loved it.  I had the salami sandwich which was good.  The little salads brought back memories of my Greek grandmother's everyday salads.  Place is a little pricy, but maybe because of quality.  Other Yelpers commented on size reduction.  We'll be back and I might try the meatball sandwich to see what comes out,"}
{"text":"I go to Andreoli's a lot for lunch because it's very close to my office.  The sandwiches and desserts are great... and the side salad that they serve with the sandwiches is so fresh with a light and simple oil and vinegar dressing.  Yes, most of the employees at Andreoli's have an Italian accent, and YES, this means that sometimes their personalities are lost in translation... but I personally love it!  The ingredients are always so fresh, and I recommend the Sempronio sandwich, especially if you are a fan of prosciutto.  I did not give the place 5 stars for three reasons:  1. it's a little expensive.  2.  Not a lot of parking.  3.  Not a lot of seating-- it gets crowded quickly.  So if you are going for lunch, make sure you are there by about 11:30.

Also, I have to add that I have been to Andreoli's at night before, and there was an opera singer... which was super cool!

**Slight amendment to original review.** I wish I could give 3.5 stars for this place.  I just got lunch there and was charged SEVEN DOLLARS for one slice of cake.  And the portion wasn't large, and the cake is dry and not very good.  Also, my friend bought some of their gourmet chocolate, and it's *ridiculously* expensive."}
{"text":"It was a Monday and there's nothing too great about Mondays. It was lunchtime and it was hot outside. I didn't bring my lunch into work so I had to go somewhere. I sat and pondered about where to go. I started driving and kept driving and it then hit me...I'd been wanting to try Andreoli for years and this Monday lunchtime was going to be the day! Would it be everything I dreamed of? Would I silently thank the owners for making me happy on this hot and miserable Monday? Would it feel like I stepped into Italy in the desert? Would I gorge not one both both halves of my sandwich? Would I leave with chocolate in my hand? The answer to each question above is yes; a thousand times yes! 

I parked my car and walked through a game of two patrons playing Foosball. It felt very much like Italy and it felt even more like Italy once I stepped through the doors. The grocer is open in the middle with plenty of homey tables and chairs and different types of Italian groceries line the walls. I immediately noticed the tasty dishes in the glass refrigerator at the counter and most importantly, the rows of desserts tempting my taste buds. 

The menu is lengthy and everything sounded delicious. From pasta to sandwiches, this Italian grocer has it all. Experiencing my typical menu anxiety, I stared anxiously at the menu and finally, asked the man behind the counter what he suggested. He said to go for the # 3 named the sempronio which had prosciutto, mozzarella and pepper sandwich on sourdough. It sounded delicious so I said \"sold!\" and moved my way to the cash register. Before I could escape though, chocolate caught my eye. Yes, I was coming off of an eating binge in Chicago but I couldn't resist so I asked for a little slice of the chocolate with marzipan in the middle. 

I lunched alone and I felt just fine doing so here. Everyone is very friendly and everything is very casual, so I sat at my table and waited for my meal to arrive. 

And now let me tell you about the Italian goodness known as my sandwich. The sourdough bread was soft, crunchy and blissful with every bite. I read in one of the reviews that the prosciutto was so good it was almost a sin to eat it with bread. That is exactly how this prosciutto was. It was salty and moist and very lean. Absolutely delicious with every bite. The peppers complimented it perfectly and I didn't even mind the biteful of garlic clove I discovered. I asked for a to-go box. I did, and I had every intention of wrapping up half of the sandwich and saving it for later. But how could I do so to something so delicious? So, the other half stayed in the to-go box all of five minutes before I consumed the remainder. I was full and satisfied. 

Here's a very important note: do not ask to change anything on the menu. What they offer is what you get and not only is it delicious as-is and shouldn't be changed, they will also refuse you if you request any substitutes. Hey, it's the Italian way and as a fellow Italian, I can honestly say: that's how we role!

I cannot wait to visit again and again. I also can't wait to buy products from their and have an Italian feast of my own at home!"}
{"text":"Hands down best Italian I've had in the states. Everything is so fresh and amazing quality. Even the bread you get before your meal comes out is to die for. Great service, a family owned restaurant that makes you want to bring all of your family there for any meal. Oh and get the tiramigu, it's like tiramisu but with Nutella and 1000 times better."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and I know what real, quality Italian tastes like. And I can honestly say that I've finally found that here in the desert! Andreoli's is the real deal. Authentic Italian. It's my new favorite restaurant in Arizona and perhaps one of my favorite Italian places generally speaking. You know it's a good place when all the guys in back are speaking Italian. And they really take pride in what they make. Their sandwiches are amazing - simply put, they use quality greens with a perfect dressing for their salads, and their desserts are fantastic. My favorite is the cannoli. 

It's a nice little atmosphere too with friendly people. And their prices I think are quite reasonable. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here many times and drive over 40 minutes just to eat and shop here for some delicious Italian items. I've never had an issue with something tasting delicious .....one problem I do have is the pricing is high. Ok, we could and have dealt with that ( and have) to enjoy getting delicious burratta, prosciutto, etc.... The bigger problem is the rude attitude you get in this establishment. Every time we visit we not only eat, but purchase 80-100$ in food to take home (which doesn't get you much) and the staff acts like you are burdening them to slice meat or cheese, scoop burratta, or box a pizza. We have tried different tactics like calling ahead to order so as not to \"bother\" them during a busier time, or coming when the doors first open so it's not a busy time......I have never felt like I needed to apologize to a business owner or their staff for trying to spend money at their establishment before!!!!! And you know what??? Bad on us for continuing to do it for the past several years....3 or 4 times each year. No more!!!! My husband is Italian and loves to cook and eat and use products that remind him of his father's restaurant (out of state) and his nonna's cooking. Let me tell you, my husband's family came straight from Italy in the 50's and 60's and he is first generation born in the US. His father runs his restaurant like you are a guest in his own home. Warm, friendly and very appreciative of his customers. I am not the kind of person who has to be treated extra special to make an experience good, but Andreoli's always makes me feel like I've added to their already bad day when I've been there. Don't worry guys, it won't happen again."}
{"text":"I have been here before with happy results, but today I left feeling scammed. I ordered a quarter pound each of two cheeses. Checking out, I was surprised by the expense. When I opened the cheese one package was over half pound and the other nearly 3/4 pound."}
{"text":"I kept forgetting to write reviews for this place. Here we go now. Rigatoni with sausage and peas is the best pasta I've ever had! It also is the only food I get every time I go there. It's too good not to get it. We tried their chocolate truffle last time, it was goood."}
{"text":"OMG-What a rip-off!  $32 for this tiny platter.  I even preordered it a week in advance.  I also ordered extra prosciutto and that was $32 a pound.  Staff is also rude."}
{"text":"This is a groovy little deli with good cheese selection and good beer. Im excited for the better weather to try that outside patio. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"One of the WORST experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. What do you do when you order a meal priced at $19.95 and then they charge you $86?? Hello? They have a price tag of $ on local eats. NOT! this is a rip off place that is misogynist and wishes they had better ambience and service. They are hoping to take advantage of nice people who just want a great place to eat. Have you ever been shouted at by the owner when no one else is around? Well I advise you to skip this place especially if you are female and alone. No respect. No service. Just rude goofballs  like the owner who feels it is his right to shout at females and give supbar serrvice with their switch and bait menu. I ordered a meal for $19.95 and got charged $86 and told to go some place else and never come back. Well I may never eat there again but I am determined to let my fellow travelors know there are much better places to eat with much better service and owners. DONT GO HERE AND WASTE YOUR $~~~
Save your time and money. Go someplace else where they appreciate women and good service and dont try to rip off nice folks,

This is thr type of Italian men we wish has stayed in Italy. CREEPS~~~"}
{"text":"Have to add my stars to the pile! 

Funky, unpretentious, great food!  The Porchetta is simply the best sandwich I've ever had, anywhere, ever. I recently started buying their bread - perhaps the best in the valley, and on a par with Acme Bakery in the Bay Area. 

To those who said this place is not 'authentic' ... I was there during the World Cup (soccer) in 2012 when Italy happened to be playing, and the place was full of Italian-flag-draped young men, all cheering and shouting in Italian.  The owners were out in force too! 

My g/f loves the 'trippa' (tripe), a seasonal special they do.  I also love the way you help yourself to beers - you just walk up to the cooler and take what you want, and pay at the end. Very homey!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best Italian food you'll eat anywhere in the United States.  It is simple and casual but their pomodoro and arrabbiata sauces are as good as anything you get in Italy.  Giovanni, the owner, is opinionated and does not want his guests to eat inappropriate combinations of food.  But, he is a master and knows what he is talking about.  Try everything from the mozzarella, to the prosciutto, artichokes, eggplant parmigian to the various pastas.  It's all excellent.

We love the people who work here.  Yes, it's true that they are not syrupy sweet and can rub people the wrong way but they are good people and they are the best in Arizona at what they do.  We go at least once a week."}
{"text":"This is an adorable place that I love to go for lunch.   Staff are a great group of guys who love to chat.  Food is delicious and simple.  I love this place because of the character, charm, and cute \"neighborhood corner\" style ambiance.  This is the type of place where you become a regular with a nickname.  Go here and eat the Tiramisu. It's the best!"}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with their menu choices, their desserts are great too.

Anyway, 4 stars, I'll be back for lunch real soon."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Italian place around.  The funny thing is, it is so far from any \"typical\" restaurant you've ever experienced.  So be prepared to experience something completely different than what you are used to.

The food is the most authentic around.  The owner and chef, Giovanni, is humble when he acknowledges that he gets at least 3 marriage proposals a week (which I found out after asking him if he was interested...)  :-)  The prices are fair to a smidgen high- but the man has his father picking herbs off the mountainside in Italy and shipping them stateside.  He makes the cheeses, pastas, and sausages by hand.   And he is almost a snob about using only the freshest and highest quality ingredients- many from Italy.   How freakin' cool is that?!!   

You will LOVE it here!   (PS- it is really funny to see how many Italians come in there.  I guess they all know where the good stuff is!)

Warmly,

Oh and they have a big sign that says'' ''We have the right to refuse service to anyone'' Better not be dark-skinned, disabled. gay, or look at the Scorzo clan the wrong way. So many places are better than this one. DeFalco's  or Guido's Deli are great options and in Scottsdale as well.  Nothing but an overpriced ''hoytie toy tie'' joint for non-italian folks who go there thinking they got something special. Trust me they didn't! I was born in emilia-romagna, Italia.  This place is a joke let a lone an excuse of italian food. Italian American are about making people enjoy their food and culture, Instead this guy is selling his products way beyond market value. How are we supposed to keep heritage culture and food alive if places are going to sell items like this so expensive. I am better of ordering a shipment from Italy or Chicago and New York where Italian deli's are aplenty."}
{"text":"My coworker and I stopped in here for a quick lunch recently and while part of me really enjoyed it, the the rest of me really didn't. The food was delicious, the atmosphere is pleasant and the workers were friendly.

The issue I have is they don't allow any customization of any kind to their sandwiches. I was looking for an 'italian' kind of sandwich with a bunch of different meats and peppers but they didn't have anything like that on their list of sandwiches. When i asked if they could do that, the woman said no. They make their sandwiches a certain way because 'he' (the owner?) says they're best that way. Ok. I guess. There was also about a 15 minute wait for the two sandwiches to arrive. 

So the food was good, but don't expect to customize your sandwich."}
{"text":"I really liked their food. Such a nice neighborhood cafe, staff speak English and Italian, most regulars are greeted by Italian style. Food served here was so authentic based on my few visits to Italy.

Came here on weekend for late lunch. Order at the counter and they will bring to your table. Nice size dinning area and patio, they were pretty busy at 3pm on weekend afternoon. Not sure why as it wasn't lunch time or dinner time.

Pasta was cooked perfectly, sauce was amazingly well cooked, portion size was a bit smell for US, or it could be I was just hungry, I finished my lunch very quickly and still hungry.  Price was more than what I wanted to pay for lunch. My pasta was $27.

Good homemade desert selection. Cannoli hit the spot, perfect way to end great lunch. They have several more desert available, I wished to try all if not for my weight. Next time I do another hard workout, I want to come back again to try another desert until I get to try all of them eventually.

They sell other food products, I was too tired to walk around that day but would like to come back."}
{"text":"Waste of time driving to this place. The sandwiches were greasy and lacked the flavor I though I would be getting from here.This food was mediocre at best. What's the deal you stand in line to order go to a table they tell you to sit at, they bring out the food and now you have to go wait in line again to pay??? Is it to much to have the waitress bring the check and collect. May be Guy should stick this one for me wasting my time, I will take a pass. Oh one more thing you all walk around that place like this place is something special, it's not."}
{"text":"It felt like we walked into Italy this evening. The service was phenomenal. The food was outstanding. Fresh, not too complicated and authentic. We got our dessert to go because we were stuffed! But of course you can't pass up canolis.. that you Guy Fieri for leading us here"}
{"text":"Really great prosciutto sandwich.  Can be a little crowded and not wild about going back up to the counter every time to get more iced tea."}
{"text":"A must try! I had the bocca di rosa because I am eating meatless! This sandwich was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had!"}
{"text":"I'd been hearing about Andreoli for quite some time, but it took me until last Thursday to go for my first visit.  That first visit was so good that I returned for dinner tonight (just a few days later).

On that first visit, I was with three other people and we shared a large mixed salad, oilves, and two different kinds of focaccia.  I had the minestrone soup for dinner that night and then we all shared several desserts.  My favorite was a merengue dessert with frosting - delicious!

Tonight's visit was just as good.  My husband once again had homemade pasta with veal meat sauce (their version of Bolognese).  I shared the fettucine with lobster in a light red tomato sauce with my mom.  My brother and dad both ordered the pork sandwich, and we again started the meal by sharing a large mixed green salad, fresh bread, and an antipasti platter.  Once again, we couldn't end our meal without something sweet, so my dad chose a nutty nuget for us to share.

While it's a casual atmosphere / grocer, and you place your order at the front counter, the service is attentive and the food is as authentic as I've found in the Valley.  We will for sure be back with the bambino in the future... Bellisimo!"}
{"text":"Very, very disappointed as this was suggested to me a the best Italian in the area. Well, I am not feeling it.  I have to agree with many other reviewers. Many of the prices seem a bit high for the quality you receive.  Rigatoni was indeed hard and undercooked.  (Yes, I too know al dente)  We also got the Roast beef sandwich with carmalized onions which had absolutely no flavor,  If you are not including any condiment or gravy on the sandwich the beef should at least be seasoned and have some flavor.  It was tender though, just flavorless.  The bread is good however.  Very old school.  Another observation was that the owner was very present and available but never attempted to make the rounds to see if folks were happy.  In an intimate place like this that would be a no brainer to me.  Another one bites the dust!"}
{"text":"On our most recent visit I had the porchetta sandwich and it was sublime. Thinly sliced pork with hints of fennel and black pepper. Also, the pistachio cake might be my new favorite dessert at Andreoli's, just barely beating out the chocolate mousse. 

We've never had a meal here that was anything less than perfect."}
{"text":"Today I tried the porchetta sandwich and a fresh cannoli. Yeah, this place just keeps getting better and better."}
{"text":"Good Italian restaurant and grocery. Pastas were very good and baked perfectly. I tried the carpaccio, just perfect. The grocery proposes real Italian products. Bresaola is my favorite ham. A part of Italy in Scottsdale. Don't wait to try this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've seen some mixed reviews for Andreoli's.  Let me set you straight: this is an authentic, family-owned place.  If you come somewhat regularly (you should!), you will recognize the same people each time.  Some of the younger employees seem to have a little bit of an attitude, but most of the staff are very attentive and authentic and truly want you to have a great experience.

There is brick-oven pizza on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  I've had this on two separate occasions and had quite different experiences.  The first time it was great, the second time the crust was a bit soggy.  I think they were simply busy and didn't leave it in long enough.  

What I keep coming back for are the sandwiches.  They are amazing and also have great vegetarian options.  I highly recommend the eggplant sandwich, even if you typically eat meat.  Its great!  The calamari (both the friend and grilled) are also great if you eat fish!  

They have several different beer and bottles of wine you can purchase, or you can choose a glass of the house wine.  Come early if you don't want to wait.  Otherwise, come for lunch!  Always order coffee and dessert -its definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"My Italian husband and I have been meaning to stop in since moving from San Francisco three years ago. Glad we did! Just a simple Panini sandwich with creamy mozzarella, fresh tomatoes, olive oil and yummy bread was soooo good! I thought I was in Florence or Roma! My husband's meat ball sandwich was delicious and the casual, Old World atmosphere reminded me of the old Italian neighborhoods in San Francisco. This will definitely will be a regular stop for us now for a quick and delicious lunch!"}
{"text":"Sought this place out after seeing it on Triple D as I was craving some authentic Italian food.

This was everything I'd expected and then some. It's a grocer with some pretty decent seating with an Old World Italian feel to it. Had some cannoli, chocolate crescent rolls, and the antipasta platter. He makes his own prosciutto there and it was absolutely amazing! The platter was full of 3 different cuts of meat, cheese, olives, plenty of bread, and dipping oil. You can buy whatever kind of meats and cheeses and a large assortment of other Italian foods both fresh and packaged. Glad we made the drive, this place was awesome!"}
{"text":"So here's da deal.  Get here.  Go here.  Eat here.  People watch here.  Take your time here.  Try an old favorite here.  Try something new and different here.  If you don't eat here, take it to go from here.  Smile here.  Do some shopping here.  Get dessert here. Most importantly, get the porchetta here.  At least try it once.  The most amazing meat with the absolutely perfect balance of black pepper, fennel, herbs and spices known to Italians.  And the Bread?  Just like nana used to make.  It's truly unreal.  Unbelievable.  Absolutely delicious.  EVERY time I am in AZ, I make Andreoli's a must stop.  Super clean, and so old school Italian.  Soccer on the TV, people talking Italian, family recipes, remarkable baked goods and pastries, meats, cheeses, salad dressing.  I seriously have not been disappointed with anything on the menu.  While it can get pricey, the portions are big.  Usually, enough to share (although you aren't going to want to).  Ti amo Andreoli's."}
{"text":"As the day started so it ends - at Andreoli's. There are moments in our culinary lives where food can transcend art and intrude in the fabric of time to move us into history. Today is one of those moments that transported us into the Calabrian country side of pre-modern Italy before fast food and institutional cooking. Tonight's farmhouse feast started with homemade elk bresaola on greens with parmesan followed by a soup of pork ribs, tomato, fresh fava beans, and magic. We ended with the most perfect al dente rigatoni carbonara."}
{"text":"Ok this is hard for me beause the food is 6 stars.  I take my friends, family, clients here and everybody raves about it ..... but.  The smart ass kids at the counter have got to go.  I don't know their names but  one in particular should retire and become a lawyer because when you ask if you can have your sandwich on Italian (roll) instead of focaccia he says \"Focaccia is Italian\" and then looks at you smugly.  I took the high road and neglected to point out to him that a baguette he offered was French.  He should  pay less attention to geography and work on his note taking skills because after all that, the sandwich still came on a focaccia.

So I hope the owner hears this, your front line of sales at the counter makes me want to go somewhere else.  Your six star food, averaged with your zero star staff puts you at a 3.  And yes Guiseppe, I want to drink diet coke and I don't need a lecture on how it has \"echemica that is a bad for your brain\". If you feel so strongly about it, then don't sell it !  I'm sure your meats contribute to heart disease but you're not grimacing when I order a porchetta sandwich (which is unbelievably good by the way)

So Andreloi, please get someone up front with a smile and who, at a minimum, has read a pamphlet on the basics of customer service.

Hate having to write this one."}
{"text":"Wow.  This is some kick ass Italian food! The sandwiches are simple but fresh and flavorful. The bread that they come on, is some of the best bread I've ever tasted. Everything I had was awesome. The grilled calamari was really good.  I had the chocolate croissant for dessert.  It was probably the best I've ever had.  And I've had a lot of chocolate croissants.  All their house made desserts looked awesome.   I saw some of the pastas going out and they looked incredible. The restaurant was clean and had a real homey feeling.  I'm part Italian and I felt right at home.  It's hard to find really high quality food these days, but these guys did it.  I like how you walk up and order, and they bring the food to your table. I'm going back very soon to try their house made prosciutto( who does that??) and their delicious looking pasta(gnocchi and rigatoni). If you think this place has bad food, you clearly don't know high quality, healthy, delicious food.  It's pretty clear why this place was rated #2 best Italian cuisine by Phoenix magazine in 2014."}
{"text":"This place is authentic. True Italian food and delicious! Just found out about this place and will be back. Had the gnocchi which was excellent. Left with a box full of cookies for later. This is definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"The reviews are hit or miss so I decided to bring my family to find out for ourselves.  The pasta was good, the sandwich was also okay and the soup was just warm.  The service was terrible and we did not feel welcome at all! Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short. As we entered staff was welcoming and courteous. Place is cute and clean, comfortable and different. Cozy. Everyone behind the counter friendly and courteous, even though it was noon and they were very busy. I had a cold sandwich and my partner had a hot sandwich. Both came with a small salad and everything was fantastic - really enjoyed it. It did take about 15 minutes for the sandwiches to arrive, which we found acceptable given how busy they were. This isn't \"fast food\" - obviously hand crafted authentic stuff here.

Afterwards bought a large loaf of bread which was to die for - still warm from the oven. The crust. The chew. Really - wow. We'd eaten a large portion of it in the car on the way home. Also, some Italian olives, kinda pricey but the best I've had.

Going back for sure"}
{"text":"As I previously stated, the owner's wife is of course denying what happened, but it is the truth. We came in at 6 pm last Saturday 3/3 and when we asked for a certain table we were told no repeatedly. Which was fine but it was they way we were told no. Like being scolded by a 20 year old.  My family has been there several times before and knew one of the servers.  So when we asked him for another table, she started cursing \"No! If he gives them another table I am going to be fucking pissed!\" Her EXACT words. And she absolutely used the restroom,  I was waiting outside the door and she was who came out. I used a toilet seat cover for TP and warned the woman after me there was none. I have no reason to lie about something so petty. I was trying to be diplomatic in my review but since you called me a liar,  I am going to call your daughter out for what she is, a rude bitch! Face it, you people are nasty and rude and no matter how good your food is, service is what make people want to come back. But just keep living in your world where your daughter is an angel and does nothing wrong. Dueces!"}
{"text":"Awesome food & the some of the 
 best, friendliest service I've had. Wonderful family owned local restaurant & deli. Anytime friends or family come to town, this place is always on the top of their lists to eat. I've never had a bite of food here that I didn't absolutely love. The pastries are sooooo good! You must get the fries!!!"}
{"text":"Holy smokes! Who would've thought this was a great place to grab a drink after work?! It's kind of weird because it's like a Deli/Store, but they serve great imported Beer here.  I had a Chimay and my colleague had a Peroni.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/andreoli-italian-grocer-scottsdale?select=CBE0pV3nfSPWS-Sp5hB5Yw#2btj3NoLj1k_Vnc16P7DWA

We had a couple before he had to go.  It's not a good place to drink alone because you'll look like an alcoholic in there, so I left to go to another place.  But I plan to return soon to try the food.

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Chef Giovanni normally does not make pasta chiote (pudding filled pastry cups) but he did for us today. The bread is superb. My dad owned an Italian bakery when I was a kid and we know BREAD!!!!! Great food, wonderful atmosphere. Also, kudos to Rosario who was our waiter....What a guy! Will always go back. Fantastic bar none!"}
{"text":"the 5 star is from my hubby... he loves this place and said everything hes ever gotten here was delicious... i on the other hand would give it a 4 start... im not a sandwich person and this place doesnt have the good italian pastas that i would order... the food was just okay for my tasting but their desserts are delicious... we got the sfogliatelle to go and ate them on the way home. they have italian sauces/pasta/desserts packaged up from other brands that you could buy. the workers there seem to know their costumers that come in so im guessing people keep coming back... ill have to try it out again next time the hubby goes"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Swordfish, scallops, shrimp.. Oh my. Definitely authentic Italian menu. We also tried the grilled calamari.. And had marzipan and butter cookies for dessert. Top notch. I can't wait to go back and have their spaghetti."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here recently and we really enjoyed the food.  The restaurant is casual with walk up ordering.   We had the pork sandwich and mushroom tortellini.  The pork was tender and had a peppery flavor.   For me it was perfect.   My wife felt it was a little too dry, but honestly I liked it just the way it was.  The tortellini was fantastic although for the price we didn't get as many as we thought we were going to. The service was great.  You have to go back to the order counter to pay at the end of the meal.  We will be going here again very soon."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Today Vermont Sandwich Company was packed, so my girlfriend and I thought we would walk over and give this place a try. Big BIG Mistake. Now I've been to Italy, hell ...I grew up in Nice, France. Not 'old world' enough for me, I ordered the Maresciallo Italian antipasto with their meats & cheese which took forever to get and charged me over $10 (big rip off) and my friend ordered a Bastard baguette (dis-appointing). This place is too over-priced in their offerings.
The main reason for this yelp is the rudeness of the staff here, the woman behind the counter had a chip on her shoulder and treated not only us but others in line with arrogance. Also the old man, possibly the owner had the same air about him.
Granted there were many off duty scottsdale police hanging around, but the whole scenario reminded me of a mafia 'front', just like back home. I guess this is a hit or miss from reading all the reviews, maybe its just from others low standards?"}
{"text":"Hate to write a great review for this restaurant, it will be even harder to get in. Having said that, it is fabulous! Never had a bad meal; they make everything from scratch, even the prosciutto. It is like being back in Tuscany. Even the coffee is terrific. Can't wait to go back. Thank you Diners, Drive-ins & Dives for showing us this gem."}
{"text":"Andreoli's Grocer is a little expensive but the ambiance alone is worth paying for. The Italian and European groceries - pastas, grains, baked goods, olive oils, wine- and the Italian conversations you hear while sitting at their antique tables and chairs, makes you feel as if you were in Italy. 

On the other hand I have mixed reviews on their food. I was disappointed in my cheese and cured meat platter. Their menu claims that their antipasto will \"take your breath away.\" I ordered the il tagliere del maresciallo and it was kinda boring. 

I expected the dish to be simple but not poorly crafted. I was expecting a variety of firm and soft Italian cheeses and a variety of smoky, spicy, and salty cured meats but got nothing more than a few flavorful meats, a handful of briny olives, and a glob of mild gorgonzola cheese. It would have been really good with one or two more cheeses.

I also ordered a panino forza Italia that was really good. The panino, English translation for sandwich, had a wonderful paring of proscuitto, gorgonzola, mascarpone, and arugula that was served between a perfectly golden crusted and soft baguette. 

I plan on going back to try a couple of other things on their menu. Until then I'm going to give them a three. Ciao!"}
{"text":"good food, good employees. the service may be a little faster, but hey, they are Italian.. they dont care :)

very unique sandwiches to choose from. Hard to remember the names of them to reorder next time. But a nice overall experience."}
{"text":"As depicted on DDD. Classy casual deli restaurant. Nice salami appetizer platter. Prosciutto was special. Gnocchi plate really good. Excellent bread and olive oil for dipping. Everyone was happy. Guess $20 a plate is considered expensive but it is Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Wow - the pasta is so over-priced - and it is just \"ok\"
The salads were great - skip the pasta - skip the sweets too!  We bought 6 cookies for $18 - are you kidding me?  And they were just so-so.  Go to Maggianos, get great pasta for 1/2 the price, and they give you an extra one to take home.  Very disappointed :("}
{"text":"Quite overpriced for the amount of food you receive and the service you get. Nothing exciting. Good food, though."}
{"text":"GREAT! Well worth the drive from central phoenix! Authentic preparation of food delivery and quality -need not miss going to Italy this summer. Green olives are in! Get a loaf of country bread lasts a week! It is large so for 2 we cut in half freeze part and enjoy rest as toast in the am. Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"I like the Authentic Italian vibe. 
Definitely Italian pricey for something that is decent  in flavor. Some veggie options but mostly meaty (what do you expect for an Italian Joint). Overall good service from a place that could very well be in Italy."}
{"text":"This market & restaurant is small and tucked away in a corner. But go and seek them out! Some of the best home italian food I've had since I moved to Scottsdale. Espresso is out of this world, and their bolognese is flawless. Try their napoleon dessert if they have any. It took me back to my old days of New York  Italian bakeries.

They also serve gelato from That's Amore, which is some of the best gelato in the state!"}
{"text":"Interesting......so many of the reviews below talk about attitude. A couple of thoughts on that. First, i have been there several times and they have been nothing but friendly, genuine and sincere. Do they sound a bit rough due to ESL and cultural tone? Sure. If you don't like that type of tone go to the Olive Garden where you won't run into a single true Italian. Second thought is, what did you do to piss them off? I think the tone and attitude in this market is exactly what I expect from a true Italian market. I have been to Italy 6 times and this is genuine Italian. You fellow patrons will likely be speaking Italian.

The food is incredible. I am not a big fan of eggplant. my wife asked me to try her eggplant sandwich and it was the best eggplant I have ever had. I will probably order that next time I am in. I had the Porchetta (Pork Sandwich) and the pork was perfectly cooked and the bread is fresh. The Maningota is what we really go here for. Make sure you save room for dessert!

THe groceries that they offer are very limited, but they are everything you would need for an authentic Italian meal. They are also ingredients that you would be hard pressed to find anywhere else."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in the town. My mother recommended to me first time when I went there after that I just fell in love with here. They change the day special menu every day it makes me exciting to see what's their special on the day! 
They makes very serious Italian food. Everything is great! You must try here"}
{"text":"We tried this place twice for lunch. The sandwiches are excellent due to the bread that they use. The overall experience is just ok. The restaurant is usually busy during lunch, so finding seating is difficult. (especially indoors). Third time wasn't the charm...food sub par and expensive. Too bad."}
{"text":"The food and service was good. I ordered a bowl of spaghetti with just plain marinara. I go up to pay for my food, and it was $18!!! That is completely asinine and bizarre considering it was maybe $1.50 worth of food. The staff was also extremely rude when I said that $18 seemed unreasonable. They didn't even have a menu out so I didn't know the price. Also, the menu written on the white board is completely illegible. Definitely would not recommend this place unless your going to get a sandwich."}
{"text":"If you come here, you better get dessert. Cannoli's are a must! Worth the price! Tastes just like Italy."}
{"text":"Will never ever step foot in this place again.  The food was good but very overpriced. The snotty girl at the counter ( I was told She's the owners daughter) was unbelievably rude.  The employees standing outside were rude. Don't need that crap when there are such good places   In the same parking lot. Like tavern grille. Great food and NICE people."}
{"text":"I had lunch here Saturday with my wife and mother in-law This food it wonderful and pure Italian food at it's best I'm from NYC and I'm Italian so trust me when I says GO THERE you wont be sorry. some of the comments say it's expensive but the quality and care of the ingredients  it's worth every penny. This isn't a sub shop it's a specialty Italian store. I had the pork sandwich and a riceball MMMM and a small tray of antipasto and I even ordered more food to go."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Great atmosphere, feels like your in grandmas kitchen on a Sunday afternoon with all the family over. Food was exquisite, we shared an antipasti platter and I had the gnocchi while my husband had the rigatoni with sausage.  The bread was perfect for mopping up the extra sauce on our plates.... All the flavors were so perfectly balanced.... Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"I was prepared for mediocre after reading some bad reviews... however, contrary to those reviews service and food was phenomenal!  From our sandwiches to the delicious pasta rigatoni with sausage cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"Great Pizzette which is not exactly pizza. Kind of like a sicilian pie with alot less cheese. Great seasonal specials are created nightly that aren't cheap but about as authentic and tasty as you can imagine. Have had most of the sandwiches which are great as well."}
{"text":"your integrity and dishonesty are really alarming and worrying instead of asking for an apology you prefer to say that I am a false identity, so 
Aaron A, who say disgustingly rude owner likely mentally unstable and/ or deficient daughter proceeds to use expletives as she slaps the tiramisu and throw it
Kristen S, lots of eye rolling and yelling in ITALIAN by the staff which make us feel uncomfortable and unwelcome.
Marcy H worst dining exerience the manager and one of the staff start to argue w me extremely rude and had zero manners.
Sandy G, the owner reminded us of Samy Bouzaglo, what an ego.
Debbie E, what an insult ur arrogant attitude if this is the way u want to treat pp live w the consequences.
Michelle H, yuk food and service very grumpy server creepy experience.
Rene I, TERRIBLE service, very rude.
Kristin P, service was terrible owner wasn't pleasant.
Lauren G, absolutely terrible worst customer service.
Gabriella S, horrible customer service.
And list goes on and on, the question here is if you are going to tell me that all these people all have a fake identity too? We are real customers unlike your family and friends who write a excellent reviews to attract new customers who then will be verbally assaulted by you and your staff.
Your arrogance dishonesty and lack of principles and values ??is reflecting on your deli"}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant 6 times. Pretty much all the food is home made. Makes their own bread fantastic. Want a steak best in town, actually likely the best one I have ever had. Pastrys are just terrific. Don't miss this off the beaten track local restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Really fabulous food! Great service! Very nice! Definitely worth the drive from the East Valley!"}
{"text":"Wow, let's just talk about Andreolis for a moment. This is easily the best restaurant in the entire Scottsdale area. What makes it so great you ask? Impeccable service down to the tiniest detail, incredible food that makes you salivate at every bite, and an intense atmosphere that makes you feel right at home. Each and everyone of my needs were met, and the host (Angelino) greeted me with utmost and genuine respect. Definitely get the Caio, so good. Also, make sure you inquire about desserts - as they were fantastic. Just woah, I am utterly speechless."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The burrata is always amazing, the grilled calamari is fantastic, and the gnocchi is unreal. Love the staff and love the environment. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Exceptional food if you actually ever get your food...horrible service overshadowed our experience.  Waited one hour for grilled fish and spaghetti w/clams; we were told both times we checked on the order that fish takes a long time to cook.  Also had to beg for more olive oil & bread during our one hour wait and a glass to pour our beer and sparkling water in.  We finally just left."}
{"text":"I sent my husband into Andreoli's to get authentic ladyfingers which are generally not carried in grocery stores.  We were in the neighborhood.  I didn't think to ask my husband the price until we got home and saw that the 17 oz. package was $14.99.  Outrageous!!!  I purchased the same bag at Guido's on Scottsdale and Shea several months ago and it was $4.99.  I will never go back to Andreoli's!"}
{"text":"My love for Andreoli Italian Grocer knows no limits! I have been coming here long before their infamous debut on diners drive in's and dives, I also reluctantly admit that I was apprehensive to yelp about this place because I was scared that once the secret got out so would my dear beloved Andreoli's. 

Thankfully, even with the major notoriety this place has received over the last year or so, not a thing has changed about this place other than the size of the restaurant and the Guy Fieri poster plastered on the door as you walk in. 

The Patriarch aka Chef Giovanni still consistently serves up some of the best Italian food in town. A must if your on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Updating my review to once again give Andreoli five stars after another four years of being a regular patron.

Another reason for my update is to say that even as a five star reviewer and regular, I do completely understand some others' criticisms of a visit to Andreoli, especially regarding the price, ordering system, and the, shall we say, \"opinionated\" owner.  Yeah the system might take some figuring out--you order at the counter, you sit, and then you'll get food runners who can take additional orders, and then you can pay at the register either when you place your first order or at the end of your meal. And yeah the brusque nature of owner and some of the staff may take some getting used to, but frankly the genuineness of the place is what give it charm. Too often in the U.S., and especially in a place as new and sleek as Scottsdale, Arizona, we get a sanitized version of life. Sometimes the beauty is in the give and take, and the personalities you feel as you dine in what is essentially the owner's living room. So, as you go to Andreoli, take a deep breath, step back, and be charmed by the authenticity--for better or worse--that we often lack in Scottsdale. Once you get to know the system and the staff you'll be treated like family. The food is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"picked up a Sempronio sandwich and took it home. It was very good, i dont like too much meat on my sandwiches to were it over takes the sandwich but i wouldn't mind a little bit more here. Id still order it again but too many other sandwiches sound great that i need to try."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall, neighborhood gem that serves authentic Italian food. Forewarn: double and triple check the price on any item on their daily menu. We ordered the lobster pasta thinking it was a good deal ($16) and turned out it was $32 for only half a lobster! The grilled calamari is amazing, nice grilled flavor with olive oil and not chewy at all. The sandwiches are really good too. My husband like the pasta with sausage sauce. 

We also like the dessert they serve. The chocolate croissant is very good and they sell out fast so grab it if you see one at dinner time. Gets crowded on weekends for dinner. Small place with limited seating so not good for large group."}
{"text":"We have been to Andreolis multiple times. My brother in law is an Italian immigrant and found this place on his own. The first time we came here was on a double date with him, my sister, and my husband. We sat out on the patio and drank wine, ate phenomenal authentic Italian food, and finished the evening with real Italian espresso. I've since been back and have ordered quite a few things on the menu, from a simple panini to one of the more elaborate pasta dishes. Each dish is made with really high quality, flavorful ingredients, so you really can't go wrong. Be careful though. This place is addicting."}
{"text":"Like others, we tried it after seeing them on Guy's Triple D.  While not having anything bad to say, I'm reluctant to say go out of your way to eat here. But if you're already in the area, stop by. If I lived nearby I could imagine that this might be on my \"hey-we haven't been there for a couple months\" list...  

Mrs Foodie had the gnocchi and while tasty, it was not served as warm as it should have been. I enjoyed the penne with sausage and peas. 

Price vs. Value/dining experience?  Not quite there..."}
{"text":"I thought everything was awesome.  We ordered the grilled octopus and it was really nice, well cooked, had a really good texture.  The bastardo sandwich was perfect, awesome bread and had the right amount of meat in it.  My friend also enjoyed her sandwich.  I thought the prices were fair for the high quality of the product, I'll definitely come back.  Thanks! :)"}
{"text":"I saw this on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and had to go.  It is a little gem in AZ!  A bit of Italy right there in the desert.

All of our lunch sandwiches were really delicious.  The bread is perfect and they come with a wonderful salad on the side.  I had the porchetta sandwich and I wish I could go back and get another.  But that would require a plane ride, so it will have to wait!  Everyone was delighted with their choices and we all loved the place."}
{"text":"So I did not read any reviews until after I visited Andreoli's Italian Grocer. I feel sometimes when it comes to italian food I have to make my own opinion. Being brought up with some of the best Italian cooks back east it is hard to go out and eat italian. I took my Mother and Son to try it out before we recommended it to our family. We took a 30 minute drive. With that said here is my review...

It is a small place, almost like a italian kitchen. There were the regulars sitting around a table watching soccer on TV. It felt authentic and welcoming Until...

\"The counter\" we experienced the gal at the counter who was not concerned about answering our questions just wanting to know what we wanted and if we did not have an answer she moved on. We finally were able to make a decision and order.  

We did order the Eggplant Parm, the Mozzarella, basil and Tomato and the beef with provolone. I have to agree with the reviewer in regards to the eggplant. There was a lot of skin that had to be picked out of the sandwich in order to enjoy it.  The beef and provolone was delicious. The flavor in the meat was spectacular. The Mozzarella, basil and tomato was delicious except I would have preferred it on the roll rather than the focaccia bread. The side salad dressing was flavorful. We ordered a side of Bread and oil because we were hoping to try the oil before purchasing the bottle. The oil was very smooth and the bread was exactly how I remember it back home. We ordered the sausage and peppers to take home to my dad. The sausage was shaped like a hamburger but it could have used more peppers and onions on it. My dad did enjoy it.

After our meal My Mother wanted to purchase the bottle of oil and some bread to take home when she approached the gal with her $25.00 bottle of oil she asked to get 2 loaves of bread.  The bread was pricey $6.75 a loaf But worth it! The gal said you can only get one loaf. My Mother's intention was to buy a loaf for my son because he loved it so much. My son then went up to the counter to look at the chocolate they had in the case. He was ignored for about 5 minutes until I went up to help him. He is 13 and almost 6 feet tall so it was not that they could not see him. He chose a piece of chocolate that looked like a screw. He mentioned that it was the best piece of chocolate he has had in a long time!. I was with him and I purchased the 2nd loaf of bread. A bit silly we had to do that!

I would definitely go back again just to purchase a loaf of bread! The food was delicious. Yes they need to step up their customer service skills but then again it didn't bother me to much as I grew up around Italians just like that, so to me it is not a deal breaker weather I would return or not. But the purchase of only 1 loaf of bread that is bothersome. Especially when you drive so far  to expect it to be a grocer as well as a deli and then you buy a $25.00 bottle of oil you need more than one loaf to go with the oil! They need to either add more products or take the grocer name off because it is a little deceiving."}
{"text":"Friend at work dragged me along to this place at lunch. I worked next to Andreoli for a long time and had no idea there was an Italian Grocer so close. First impression on the inside was it's a beautifully appropriate Italian interior. The design gave it the feel of what an actual grocer in Italy would be like. Kind of claustrophobic on the inside but I got over it quickly. Next time, I'd eat outside as the weather was perfect. I placed an order for the Sempronio sandwich. Sat down and took in the atmosphere.

It seemed like a lot of the customers on the inside were actually authentic Italian people. I heard some Italian language being thrown around. If they are showing up here, this place must be good I thought.

2 minutes later, a server came out with our sandwiches. Sandwich looked great with prosciutto, mozzarella and roasted peppers practically melting off the sides of the nicely baked bread. A small salad was included on the plate as well. It was so fresh and it I really loved the flavor. Nice and crunchy. Mozzarella was mouthwatering. We couldn't stay long so I get a box to go from a nice girl who worked there. 

Overall, I would recommend Andreoli to others out there who are near the Scottsdale area. My only complaint would be the price as the sandwich was near $9 but I mean for the quality it makes sense but I ask for too much. Also, I apologize to the people there for not pushing in my chair. I hope nobody tripped."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE WAS HORRIBLE. terrible terrible service, didn't even get to eat because we were so disappointed in the way they handled customer service. just because this place was featured on food network channel doesn't mean they need to treat their customers shitty! wish I could give it NO STARS."}
{"text":"Andreoli's is as authentic as it comes. A family ran italian grocer/restaurant, you will find yourself as the only non Italian person eating dinner most nights, unless you're Italian of course. 

Their calamari is always fresh and cooked to perfection. My favorite item if available is the Florentine Steak, big enough for 2-3 people to share. Their pizza, mushroom ravioli, veal pasta are always on the top of my list. 

You will leave feeling full (in a good way) and completely satisfied every time.This place is worth every penny and I always can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in the desert!  Great food, great service,  will continue to go back"}
{"text":"Is it a restaurant or deli? I've tried this place twice and both times I was disappointed. Both meals were under seasoned with no flavor. Not worth your time or money."}
{"text":"After seeing this spot on local TV, I had to give it a visit. If for no other reason than to peruse the grocery stuffs.
Boy was I pleasantly surprised. They have a huge variety of dishes to suit everyone's Italian Desire. I've been here twice now and each time it was fantastic. I've had 2 different pasta dishes and took half home each time. 
They have a great variety of meats and cheese, olive's and salads. 
I've only had the cheese cake but everything they have looks to good to eat. 
I can't wait till they have the seasonal dish I saw on TV. A roast type of meat with potato and broth served like a soup during the cold months. 
If you want some good Italian, this is the place for the food."}
{"text":"This place is a definite find! Tucked away in the corner of a shopping center, but once inside it is a gem. The food was excellent and the place was adorable. The antipasto board was amazing and the bread out of this world. It wasn't very busy on the night we were in, but I have a feeling this little place gets packed. If it doesn't, it should! I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Absolute best Italian sandwich! The restaurant is very authentic with workers that speak fluent Italian to each other. The simplicity yet high quality of their food is what makes this place an absolute gem."}
{"text":"Amazing. Amazing. AMMMMAAAZZZINNNNG!!!!! Here is the deal I spent a year abroad in Florence during college. Loved it. Loved the food. I think Florence is to blame for my foodie ways. A few years back my friend who lives in the valley and also lived in Florence found this place. We went . . . and since then it is one of my favorite places to go. AUTHENTIC. Is the only thing you need to know about this place. From the Italian TV on the station - to the staff (speaking Italian across the counter at each other). This place takes me back to Florence. The sandwiches are amazing. And the desserts . . . well they are delicious. To put all this into context this is a place we will drive 45 minutes across town to for lunch."}
{"text":"Okay food, but too expensive. The real downfall of this place is the disgustingly rude owner and his daughter, who clearly haven't been educated in proper common courtesy towards their customers and employees. I decided for this reason to make a yelp account and would like to share just one example of the last time I went:

A law school buddy of mine and I went about a month ago and he asked for some tiramisu from the front. The man working there scooped a generous amount up, put it on a plate, and brought it to the register where the owner's likely mentally unstable and/or deficient daughter proceeds to use expletives as she slaps half of the tiramisu off the plate and throws it out, just as my friend had his credit card out and about to pay for it! Furthermore, she proceeds to berate and harass the worker in front of the entire restaurant for giving my friend \"too much\" tiramisu. This made for an equally awkward and terrifying situation for everyone in the establishment. 

The rest of the waitstaff are semi-friendly, but it doesn't offset the negative attitude and atmosphere exuding from the owner and his family. I have been here many times and at this point, am done with the overall rudeness. There are plenty of better Italian restaurants out there that don't have mediocre food and a family of psychos running it."}
{"text":"I really had high hopes for this place. I saw it on diners & drive-ins, plus an old Italian friend said he liked it, but it turned out to be just meh. I started with  a dried beef and Arugula salad. Followed by a grilled calamari plate, kind of chewy, cooked too long I think. Finally we split a seafood pasta and a Pork dish. The fish in the pasta was overcooked also and dry not much sauce served over regular spaghetti, but the sparse sauce may be the style. The pork was good even if paper thin. Once again that may be their style of the dish here. We had 2 small glasses if house wine. I'm talking about barely a 4 oz pour. The bill was $106. Definitely not worth it for how mediocre them meal. I guess I'm willing to spend that amount for Italian food but I expect to be blown away by the food. 

Not much ambience and the service was fast but not more than minimum effort. The place was not busy."}
{"text":"Andreoli is the kind of simple counter restaurant that I can eat at over and over again, even in the same week. The food is just perfect. Sandwiches are all tasty with just the right dressing. The pasta specials are magical. The salads are so tasty. If you are looking for truly authentic fast casual Italian food in Scottsdale look no further."}
{"text":"The food and ambiance of the restaurant was amazing. The only thing that could have made this place better is if the servers take your order, instead of ordering at the counter and sitting down with a designated table number. For entrees that cost $18-19, I think you deserve to be able to read about it on the menu, instead is standing at the counter trying to read quickly to get the line moving.   Otherwise I thought the music was great, incredible food."}
{"text":"Best spaghetti meat sauce I've ever had. This is a must go place if visiting Phoenix. Can't wait to go back! How can I get the meat sauce recipe? It's called Bolognese. Yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm in love. I've been wanting to go here ever since I found it on Yelp and finally had the chance to go. The set-up is a little confusing when you get in, but luckily I went with a \"regular.\" First, you go up to the counter where they have their menu on chalkboards and order behind the counter. You then get a number and have to go stake out a table. They then bring your food to you and you pay at the counter after you're done. I know, it doesn't sound that complicated but it's a pretty tight space and there are people everywhere so it was a little overwhelming. Anyway... I forgot which sandwich I had but it had salami and cheese on it, which is a win for me. The sandwich was a little smaller than I expected, but turned out to be the perfect amount. The side salad was simple but tasty. I had the tiramisu for dessert too which was delicious. I was told that the croissants are a must have and went back on a weekday around 7pm. They had plenty of croissants left and I got a cannoli too. The croissant was so good. Buttery goodness. I would love to try one in the morning after they've been made. It was packed when I went on the weekday too with families. I'll definitely be back, would love to try their pizza and gnocci!"}
{"text":"This is a fairly casual Restaurant and Deli where you go up and Order then you get a number and they bring your food to the table. The food is very good authentic Italian. Some of the main courses are somewhat expensive however the sandwiches and salads are reasonably priced and feeling if you don't want to go the route of the meal.  The bresaola is the best i have had since Chicago.
I really would give it five stars except for the fact that the calamari is better elsewhere and they didn't have any kind of sauce or marinara . The home made Italian sausage was really good but could have used some Italian peppers and onions to make it perfect. So I would give this place four and a half Stars especially for the money. We had calamari a feeling sandwich and the meat platter two beers age and the tab was around $40."}
{"text":"This is a weekly hang out for some family members who love the eggplant sandwich.  I ordered take out - the #2 Caio sandwich - beef, cheese and grilled onions with a small salad not really a salad just a handful of lettuce nothing else so I doctored the lettuce up a bit when I arrived home adding more lettuce, red onions, cucumbers and it was good.  But the sandwich did not taste too good once I arrived home as it was not hot any longer and I needed to doctor it up to so it tasted better - so added some red onions and goat cheese plopped it in the toaster oven for a few minutes and wowla a great tasting sandwich.  I did love the bread and someone said they make their bread from scratch.  I hope this is true. Pretty good place for sandwiches if you eat in, take out not so much.  The pastries are still way over priced even for ritzy Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My work has used this little joint a few times for small lunches. Sandwiches are truly fantastic. Very authentic Italian, both the food and atmosphere. Sandwiches are very tasty, albeit a bit greasy, but it's italian, what do you expect? Salads are fresh, pastries are delicious, and the pizza (made only twice weekly i think) is divine. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"This place is beyond amazing. Both my husband and I loved our dishes. I got the porchetta  sandwich. It was flavorful and delicious. The cannoli  was delicious also. We will be going again and would like to try other items. We went for lunch on a Thursday and the place was packed."}
{"text":"What an awesome find! My doctor recommended this place as he said their pizza is better than Bianca. I had to try for myself after he made a bold statement like that. I had their pizza by the slice that they sell for lunch and it was outstanding. 

I also grabbed a few things to go as well. This is a family owned and operated business. Great food and a very authentic \"Italian\" feel. Mamma Mia!"}
{"text":"I've often thought that all I really need to sustain in life is bread and salami.  But thats just a pipe dream and if my doctor ever read this he would have a few other things to suggest.

But really, its so simple and yet so good.  Which is Andreoli in a nut-shell.  An Italian deli at its finest.  The salami was quality.  The bread, a perfect baguette, was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Add arugula and some roasted peppers and I'll tell you what you got there . . . . you got big yum!

Yes, its a bit pricey, but the sandwich did come a side salad of fresh romaine and other assorted lettuces tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette with fresh cracked pepper.  A surprise I very much enjoyed.  And frankly, I know where to get a cheap meal but I will happily pay for quality any and every day.

I'm not sure I'll ever be on this side of town again, but if I am, I will keep this place in mind."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful Italian restaurant. The food is excellent (the zia Rosina salad is so fresh & tasty). The gnocchi is delicious & the dessert is to die for. We drove from Mesa (where we were staying) & worth every mile."}
{"text":"Bit pricey for a piece of tiramisu however it was delicious. I wouldn't mind treating myself on special occasions."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible and has the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Not to mention in all of my years of buying italian cheese I've never seen a Castelmagno this absurdly overpriced (65 dollars a lb for cheese). I cannot and will not ever support this business ever again."}
{"text":"Best prosciutto I've ever had! All of the pastries I had were incredible too. Stopping here is worth the trip any time you're close to the area. The owners & workers were incredibly kind as well."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp looking for open places to get a latte after 8pm off the 101 freeway. This place is one and done. Took a sip and had a long curly hair coming out thru the lid. I know it's not mine because the little hair I have left is a number 2 buzz cut. Should've stuck with my gut and went to The Henry."}
{"text":"I have now eaten here several times and my original review pretty much stands.  The food is usually better than good but there are occasional misses.  And I can't get away from thinking that Andreoli is a bit too expensive for a neighborhood eatery."}
{"text":"Phenomenal prosciutto and mozzarella sandwiches.  I especially like the Forza Italia.  I like sitting on the patio better than inside as it can get a bit crowded."}
{"text":"I love Andreoli's.

You have to know what this place is before you go. 

It is European and Italian..... Small delicious sandwiches, great coffee, and wonderful small plates of pasta.

It is not a black tie affair!!!! Which is GOOD!!!

I can get 5 star grandmas home cooking while wearing shorts and flip flops...

Uhhh, the pork sandwich...... thank you sir may I have another...."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here because the fancy place we had dinner at didn't have any appealing dessert. We had Tiramisu and it was the best we ever had in US. Real Tiramisu and not too sweet. Simple and not pretentious. Heard some Italian accent. Sweet. And soccer on TV. Love it."}
{"text":"Passing through from out of town. Sought out this place because I saw it on Diners, Drives, and Dives. 
The food was good, but very expensive. I ordered for lunch a all fish special; well-prepared. But I wanted some pasta. I received what I asked for, a side size of pasta with garlic and olive oil; that alone was 8.00. Total price for my lunch was $46.46. 
It was good, but not sure I'll come back when I'm town again."}
{"text":"Not sure why people use price as a way to give poor ratings of quality restaurants and food establishments... Especially when those prices are reflective of the quality ingredients used. With that said, the food is well worth it. Fresh pasta, beautiful ingredients and the sandwiches are TO DIE FOR! Absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for great Italian food in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Have to admit I liked the place but was really disappointed because with Grocer in the name I expected more product available for purchase.  Instead it was one bookcase of a few dried fruit pastas and some jarred sauces.   I was hoping to find a much larger selection"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, pastas and the best chocolat mousse ever!!! Could do better with the wine by the glass choice but all the rest is good!!"}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Italian delis in AZ and filled with personality. Very NY deli grocery feeling and the sandwiches are prepared with lots of love. The Bastardo is da best!"}
{"text":"Food was really good, service was TERRIBLE.  I love the little grocer vibe.  Owner wasn't pleasant."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the service is good. It has a good vibe! I've had their Lasagna and the Gnocchi. Cant go wrong in this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. We are coming back for sure with our Italian loving family. The calamari, burrata, and prosciutto were all world class. They were also an acceptable value. The spaghetti with clams was also good.

As many have said, we heard about this place from a tv show. While the hospitality here is more straightforward than warm, we didn't have any of the service mishaps I read in other reviews. Recommended."}
{"text":"As good as it gets as far as authentic Italian spots in Arizona. My family and I have been coming here long before it was discovered by Guy Fieri. 
The food is a great quality The atmosphere is great. Family ran businesses are become far more rare and that is exactly what this place is. It's a little place with great food. Make this a destination If you are ever in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and fast. You would think you're in Italy based on the inside atmosphere and food. Great deli selections and market items to choose from. Food tastes just like it was made fresh in Italy. I would recommend Andreoli to anyone who wants a taste of Italy!"}
{"text":"Every time I have been here, the food's been amazing.  I've only had the sandwiches, which are on delicious homemade bread, and come with a nice salad.  They are well priced for the amount of food I get.  The porchetta is absolutely the best!  The atmosphere is nice, and the service is great too.  I haven't had any of their entrees, but I usually only come here for lunch, or for dinner before I go bowling at Via Linda Lanes."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I've been here 4 times. 3 of the times I have gotten the porchetta sandwich.  Best sandwich in Arizona.  The pork is seasoned perfectly and is tender.  Fresh baguette for the sandwich.  Side salad is the perfect addition to the meal.  Wish it was closer to HOMEBASE!"}
{"text":"I'd seen this place on DDD so decided to try it out. It did not disappoint. Stopped by right as it opened to grab a sandwich for a flight I was taking. Decided to go with the prosciutto and mozzarella with no peppers (since I wasn't eating it until later and didn't want them to make the sandwich soggy.)

The guy at the register was super nice. Said it would be a few minutes because they were just taking the baguettes out of the oven (who can be mad at THAT??). About 5-7 minutes later, they brought my sandwich out. 

I didn't eat it until about two hours later when I was on the plane but WOW. The baguette was perfect. Slightly crispy on the outside but super moist with just the right density. The prosciutto was really great with wonderful saltiness. The mozzarella was perfect too. 

All of it added up to one of the best sandwiches I've eaten in a long time. Guy Fieri was right on this one. Go to this place and get you a sammie...  now!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. I understand it's a family owned business and customer service is not a priority. We waited an hour for our dinner that was served to another table. I understand the mistake but they did not care at all. The food is good but don't expect any good service. Btw, they are rude!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Some of the best Italian you can get.  Anywhere.  The cheese selection and salumi, excellent.  The pasta, always al dente and always delicious.  Had some arancini there that was also great.  Crowded during dinner time, the place is pretty small, and the counter service isn't conducive to getting the most attention, but I can ignore all that for the food that comes out of the kitchen.

Whenever I throw a party, I always have them put together a cheese and salumi platter for me and for a reasonable price, they put out a wonderful product."}
{"text":"I grew up in a traditional Italian family. Everything made from scratch, women cooking at every possible hour each and every day in the kitchen, Sunday family feast dinners....the whole shebang.  So needless to say, I am very critical of Italian restaurants because in most cases I know I can make any dish better at home. Andreoli's is one of the few Italian restaurants I continuously come back to. Why? Because the first time I came here 6 years ago I knew it was legit Italian food the moment I walked in the door for two specific reasons : A. They serve grilled calamari. B. They have a seat (in this case entire table) designated for the owner. If you come from an old school traditional Italian family, you will understand grilled calamari trumps fried calamari and the males of the household always have a designated seat at the dinner table.

If you want to feel like you are in your Nonna's kitchen or eating a meal in Italy, you won't regret paying a visit to Andreoli's"}
{"text":"a true italian gem felt like home (NY)!!! the guys are super friendly and helpful great choices of italian sandwiches and salads bread fresh and on point fresh mozzarella and the tastiest meats around not to mention melt in your mouth italian pastries will be back"}
{"text":"l can't say enough about this place! Simply AMAZING!!!
I take all my friends and family to this place when they come in from out of town! Absolutely love it.
The food is amazing. You can tell it is made fresh and not out of a can. The staff is so nice and make you feel like family.
They are happy to serve you, and seem genuinely glad that you are there. It is such a refreshing change!!!
I mean just look at all the exclamation points I've used in this review. 
That should tell you something."}
{"text":"Great Italian food. Feels authentic Italian and is delicious. Nice for a dinner w family."}
{"text":"I went to lunch with a friend who recommended this restaurant, but she usually gets sandwiches.  I decided to try one of the daily specials, gnocchi with tomato cream sauce.  It was $17, which seems like a high price for a lunch item, but thought I would give it a chance.  I got a medium-sized serving of lukewarm gnocchi, not the best I have had, and it was definitely not worth the price.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"Wow!  Great Italian food in PHX.  This has got to be the most authentic Italian food in the area.  It was only missing the wise guys at the corner table.   Cannoli' are awesome.  I had the prosciutto sandwich which was equally as good."}
{"text":"best food, i have tried sandwich s pasta,soups, and deserts .All so good"}
{"text":"We loved it and would recommend it to anyone. The service was excellent. They were very friendly and willing to help. We had a couple of young kids and they made us a special meal for them. I got the porchetta it was delicious. The bread was great. My wife got the rigatoni with sausage and broccoli. I even liked that more. They make their own sausage and you can tell. Everything was fresh. No frozen stuff here."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this dining experience. It's a walk up and order place, but the service is so good. They bring everything to you and it's really amazing - the BREAD in particular was incredible.

I also recommend the pastries and desserts.  The wine was delicious and the pizzas looked amazing.
Check it out!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from Seattle and saw this on DDD like many others.  Decided to check it out and  we were not disappointed.  We loved the platter with meats, cheeses and olives and the fabulous crusty bread.  We shared a wonderful simple salad and the seafood pasta special.  We had such a great experience we plan to go back tomorrow.

Charming and full of small town Italy flavor!"}
{"text":"We've been here three times now, found it through diners/drive ins. As many others have commented, the ambiance isn't that inviting, lots of eye rolling and yelling in Italian by the staff which makes people uncomfortable and feel unwelcome. The grocery section is ok, I spotted a jar of Nutella for $11, so, there's that. We had an appetizer (charcuterie was a few types of see-through thin meat, 3 cubes of mozzarella, and 4 olives - good, but no roasted reds, grilled veggies, etc), 2 adult pasta dinners and one kids meal, 3 cookies, just under $100. No salads. My main issue with it is that I'm about 90% certain it's boxed pasta. I can feed my family 2x on a $1 box of pasta. The sauces are good, and we finish every bite (the portions are reasonable, not huge) but it seems excessive to pay so much if it's not fresh pasta. We love to support local and family- owned businesses, but this one is expensive."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by a friend of mine. My whole family loves to eat out and order Italian food. I called today, Sept 2 at 644pm, and a guy answered with an italian accent and was rude. #1. I told him this is my first time and i wanted to order. 2. I asked him what are your best sellers on sandwiches. 3. He said we have a lot, we have 10 sandwiches, you want all 10 and i can hear another guy laughing in the background. That rubbed me the wrong way. Not only you lost one potential customer and a family but also you lost a referral from me to advertise your store at my office ( FYI my office is located in Via Linda and 104th) . WOW , this is what you call rude service at the onset. I am also a trip advisor badge member, i will post a review and i will make sure my friend does not go back there."}
{"text":"Full review blogged:

Crostini di Fegatini alla Fiorentina:  $5. Nothing complicated here, just rough ground chicken liver pate over homemade toasted bread with a bit of parsley.  Served chilled and ample in portion, no complaints.

Maialino:  $18.  The most limited item on the menu this spit-roast baby piglet was gone by the time we left and although the skin could have been crispier the flavors were spot on - the pork supple and rife with notes of garlic, rosemary, coriander, and pepper while the skin was slightly sweet and plenty smoky.

Panino con Porchetta: $8.95. Much like the Maialino this could have used a bit more crackle on the surface but all things being equal it would be pretty hard to complain about crusty Italian bread wrapped around warm pork roast with plenty of black pepper, fennel and light citrus notes.

Baccala` in Umido con Polenta: $18. One of my primary reasons for wanting to visit Andreoli in the first place was this dish and thankfully it did not disappoint one bit.  Big in portion, huge in flavor, and in my opinion the most well executed dish of the afternoon I figured going into it that the cod would be excellent and as good as it was, the biggest shocker of the dish was perfect execution of the polenta - toothsome, dense, and a veritable sponge for both the tomatoes and the briny fish.

Caponata Sicula: $5. Simple, savory, and perhaps the deal of the day this plate of tender eggplant, briny capers, pine nuts, tomatoes, balsamic, and olive oil with hints of basil and onion was plenty to share and would have only been better with some warm bread for dipping.

Trippa alla Toscanaccia: $14. With almost half of our table having never eaten tripe and another not really a fan of the dish I figured I'd be doing most of the legwork on this dish and although everyone took a taste my suspicions fortuitously proved correct - an acquired taste for sure, this was really good.  Thin like soup and plenty fatty despite being loaded with meat with notes of onion, tomato, and vinegar at the fore while mint and garlic came through on the palate this was another place that some extra bread would have been welcomed as far too much broth remained at the end.

Mille Feuille: $7. While I contest this should have been referred to as a Napoleon I guess it really doesn't matter because regardless of nationality what we received was flaky pastry wrapped around lightly sweetened pastry cream.  Clearly not as transcendent as some of the a la minute options being turned out elsewhere as this one had been stored in the chiller all day I have to say I was largely impressed by the separation of the layers and lack of sogginess.

Rhum Baba: $2 each.  Also straight from the chilled case these traditional baba were everything one could hope from the classic dish - a buttery ball of pastry drown in rum; a sledgehammer of flavor up front with a buttery sweet finish; at one bite each I'm pretty sure I'd have been tipsy with a half dozen.

Struffoli: $4.  Another very traditional selection you don't really see all that often at Italian markets or bakeries these marble sized pastry balls were crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and absolutely dredged in honey.  A stark textural juxtaposition to the baba which was soft throughout I personally enjoyed these a lot, though having sat for a while the honey had begun to harden which made them a bit difficult to extract from the small dish.

Cornetti: $2.50.  Golden crisp on the outside, buttery caverns within, and fortunately a brand new batch when I ran back in to make my purchase this warm nutella croissant was the highlight of the sweets for me - a strong contender for best croissant in town that remained fluffy despite the chocolate-hazenut filling while the exterior shattered to the tooth.

Sfogliatelle: $3.  Lightly citrus thanks to the use of candied lemon peel, even crispier than the cornetti on the outside, and a pillow of ricotta smoothness within - if you go to Andreoli and don't order one of these you're missing out...as a matter of fact, I'd go so far as to suggest that this item alone is worth a visit to Andreoli as it was every bit as good as any I've ever tasted on either coast (admittedly having not yet been to Italy.)
 
Schiacciata uva: $4.  I'd never tried this prior to Andreoli's and, as a matter of fact, I'd never even seen it.  Quite simply a focaccia base with fresh grapes placed at the center prior to baking thus allowing the juices to infuse the dough as it cooked this was sweet, light, and full of flavor - the sort of dish that would be easy to whip up for a party and equally easy to dress up in any number of variations.

The Verdict:  Fresh, rustic, and very authentic this one definitely goes on the 'under the radar' list and while I'm unable to speak to Andreoli's quality during normal business hours I can only say that based on what I experienced at the Christmas festival I'm eager to return."}
{"text":"I was having a small dinner party and needed some fresh pasta.  I did an online search and came up with Andreoli's.  It was a 35 min drive but I figured it was worth it for fresh pasta.  So I drove out to Scottsdale, picked it up and drove back to Peoria and put the pasta in the fridge.  Company arrived, sauce was ready so I took the pasta out of the fridge and opened the pkg only to find it was covered in mold.  Was so mad after making the effort to buy fresh.  Had no choice but to then cook pasta from a box.  Now what happened next is what infuriated me.  The next day I drove back to Scottsdale to return the pasta and show them and was told that I must have left it in the hot car or opened it the day before I used it!  I did neither.  The clerk then took it to the back and returned saying the same thing.  So I asked her if she was calling me a liar?  She said no but those were the only 2 things that could have happened.  I asked for my money back and immediately left.  Needless to say I will never return."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants! The atmosphere is  inviting and very family oriented. Their staff is very helpful, knowledgeable and super friendly. The food is absolutely amazing! They have a very diverse menu and everything we tried was fantastic, I really enjoyed the grilled squid for an appetizer as well as the gnocchi. The guys next to us got the whole branzino and it smelled and looked amazing, that's what I'm getting next time. The tiramisu was the best we've ever had and they also have a pistachio cake and Merengata. Don't forget the pastries that are so good we bought some to go."}
{"text":"For years that has been one of my favorite places in the valley. The only problems are that its pricy (but okay we can splurge) and the desserts and pasta are delicious. Since we try to avoid carbohydrates, that makes things a bit difficult. The heck with difficult, seriously there is no way I'm not having a piece of something after that great meal. I've been to Italy many times and constantly have the urge to go back. Well, that isn't happening, but I can go to Andreoli's and make believe. By the way, after you eat, take home a few things. Lots of genuine treats from the Old World. Seriously, where else can you find white anchovies and real mortadella? This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Ok, I give up. I had a previous review of Andreoli that I gave 3 stars. They probably didn't care anyway. I gave it a lower rating because of the lack of service.

At this point, I just don't care. I've been back to Andreoli for lunch a couple times in the past couple of weeks and the food is just so good it doesn't matter. I also didn't have a repeat of the wait from hell so maybe that's helped change my mind?

The first visit back, I went with Giovanni's recommendation (which I'd heard from Eytan over at Phoenix Knife House) of the Mortadella (kind of similar to bologna but so much better) sandwich. Just Mortadella & nothing else. It was killer. Loved it. I've never had a bad sandwich all the times I've been there. Their bread is killer. Always nicely dressed. The salad that comes alongside is wonderful. Can't go wrong. I was with 7 people and they all loved their food.

We also did a number of orders of the patatine fritte (fried potatoes & leeks). They're pretty much the best french fries ever. I also ordered some mozzarella in carrozza (fresh mozzarella and bread dipped in batter and sauteed). That was quite nice too. 

Washed it all down with a Limonatta.

My last visit, I had the ridiculous fried potatoes & leeks of course and they were awesome. I did the arrapato sandwich (breaded pork loin with arugula and parmigiano). Stellar again.

So I just give in & admit that I'm addicted to the food at Andreoli and am already overdue for my next visit."}
{"text":"Simply fabulous. From the cakes to the pastas to Francesca's perfect butt and electric smile. This place just rocks.

Bring your Italian friends here's everyone speaks Italian!

Warning. The prices are a bit crazy for the size of the food. $20 for a bowl of Penne with just sauce type crazy. $7 for a small slice of cake. 

Other than that. Fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I won't ever pass by without stopping for a Cosa Nostra, it is my fovorite sandwich! It's so so good!  Get the fries too! They are bomb as well! Everything I've seen from here is amazing!  If I lived closer I'd eat here several times a week.. Don't sleep oon this 1."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Italian food and this place is our go to restaurant. The staff are extremely friendly. The restaurant is small, clean and very charming. Now off to the food. The food is the most authentic that I have had in a very long time. My husband and I both love the Caio. This sandwich has beef and sautéed onions. It is to die for. My go to dish is their Rigatoni with house made sausage and peas. It is absolutely phenomenal. We have never had a bad visit here and try to make biweekly visits."}
{"text":"Run, don't walk to Andreoli. Fantastic! On the last visit we had a sausage, pepper and onion sandwich with grilled calamari and a side of fresh anchovies. The sausage was spiced perfectly and cooked to perfection. I'm not sure I'll brush my teeth tonight so that the taste lingers on and on. This is the real deal. We've been back many times with consistently the same result: great! And the owner and waiters are very friendly when it's not busy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Andreoli, you disappoint me. Here's why...
After not visiting you for nearly a year, I craved your food. Either you are resting on your laurels or stopped caring or both.
With crummy weather that we had today, a friend suggested your restaurant. Well other than the coffee that is consistently excellent, the pasta dish I ordered left everything to be desired...I ate because I was hungry but there was nothing in that dish worth recommending - dried pasta, uninteresting ragu - no sauce whatsoever....blah! 

So much for driving 20 minutes to come see you, I'll stay home next time thinking of you and make my own meal and not spend $ 13 for a dish that's not even worth two bucks.

On top of that, you are too busy talking on the phone instead of taking care of your customers. Not even one person bothered to ask us how our food was."}
{"text":"True Italian food, service was great food was amazing . We would come again. I had the ribs and pasta . This place is a little piece of Italy in AZ. Wish I lived close by"}
{"text":"My wife's uncle took us to this place. I felt bad for him as he was trying to give us a good dining experience. Very nice and generous man. However when we got there nobody wanted to help us with anything. The poor guy had to go and ask for a server. The guy behind the counter looked irritated that we had to peruse the menu on the wall behind him and taking too long apparently. Then my wife's uncle wanted to order an appetizer so once again he had to get up and get someone's attention as apparently we were invisible that day. So we are eating the appetizer and the girl comes by and asks if we are still eating it, to which we replied that we were. So we finish the food and wait and wait and wait. So he has to flag her down and ask about our food to which she says oh it's because you were still eating your appetizer so we waited. I get the concept, however we had been finished with the appetizer for 15-20 minutes and the food had been ready the majority of that time. We figure she would have paid more attention so we could get our food and get out of there since it was apparent we weren't favored customers. I asked for a refill on the tea.....should have known better by that time. Stupid me. Needless to say I did not get a refill lol! I had already overstayed my welcome lol! Terrible service the waitress was awful and did not want to communicate to us so it was an awful experience. The only good thing about my experience was that I had a good view of the tv while we waited and waited for our damn food. The food? It was ok. Not worth the bad service though. At least we had a good conversation while we were being ignored though. Guy Fieri got this one wrong, then again they aren't stupid enough to treat him like a regular lowlife customer."}
{"text":"I don't get all the hype from other reviewers.  We have been to this place a few times, and it is nothing special.  Tonight, we shared the penne with veal sauce.  To be fair, the veal sauce was excellent, but the penne was seriously undercooked (yes, I can tell the difference between undercooked and al dente).  And it was served pretty cold.

We were not offered any parmesan to go on top of the penne.  And although we got bread, it was four slices of thick bread.  No oil, no butter, just plain and dry.

On the other hand, the mixed green salad was very good.  I like a lot of dressing, so for me it was fine.  Others who like less dressing might disagree.

We went in the evening, so it was dark out.  It was also pretty dark in the restaurant.  The lighting is dim and unflattering, and the seating is a hodge podge of mix and match furniture.     

The service is okay."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch! Keep doing what you guys do..... if people want Olive Garden, they should go to Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"It took us forever to get our meal . I ordered the most expensive meal on the menu which is seafood combination with potatoes. $34 for an entree . We waited half hour and I got two undercooked unpeeled shrimp , few small pieces of cold fish with no taste to it , few pieces of looked like previously frozen potatoes and small pieces of broccoli. And it's for $34 ??? Common ! I could have gone to Ocean Club for this price and have an amazing meal there . My friend ordered pasta with veal sauce and it was horrible , tasted like one of the frozen meals at the grocery store in a frozen section , actually I think frozen section tastes better , and the price was matching to the hi end Italian restaurants. And it was cold too . Calamari is the worst dish I've ever had . 4 pieces of oily no flavor calamari socked in oil . This place should stick with servicing sandwiches not entrees they can't even cook and they serve if for the price of hi end restaurants . Guido's deli is 1000 times better !!! I will never come back to this place again . Yuck !!!!"}
{"text":"This is truly a jewel in the desert. The home made prosciutto sandwich on homemade bread is to die for! The calamari fritto also was perfect! The minestrone was just like mama made! One of my top 5 places ever!!"}
{"text":"The three us had several entrees and a few small plates all great. Wine selection poor and limited. Italy has some great wines, but this place hasn't a clue.
Service ok."}
{"text":"Very over priced. Had the beef carpaccio salad which was only a few small pieces of meat and a tiny bit of shaved parm on top of mixed greens for $10. Not worth it at all"}
{"text":"Very very good food, but too pricey to go back. I had gnocchi and it was delicious, but it didn't come with anything like soup or salad, and it was $20!!! Way too much money in my mind for a plate of just gnocchi. All in all, the food was delicious, just expensive for the pastas that didn't come with anything on the side."}
{"text":"By far, the best Italian Restaurant/ Grocery in Greater Phoenix.
It can rival New York.
Really!"}
{"text":"Just came from there, Owner's son had a  attitude with me, just having fun , I'm from Boston. Ordered a salad with Calamari , little extra marina. They don't allow it. No nobody  in Italy would let you have extra   Maraina  sauce bullshit! We're Italian American's belong to the Italian American Club, & we go to Italy & Sicily every year! First time & last! Calamari was so salty! Give me a break!"}
{"text":"Really well executed italian food... need a little flexibility !

---------

We were visiting family in Phoenix from the northeast.  Let me start by saying that I'm a first generation italian....I think I know my way around legit italian-american food ....this place is the real deal!   In fact, I would dare say that this is some of the best Italian 'fast casual' food I have ever had.

Highlights. ........
............................
We decided to split some sandwiches since they had so many interesting choices.   The eggplant was sublime....never had such a delicious eggplant sandwich...the sauce was out of this world....don't expect a tired old take on eggplant parmigiano with heavy breading or slabs of mozzarella. ...it's super delicious and a fresh take

If you think I liked the eggplant. ...then wait until you try the porchetta sandwich. It was crazy good!  Excellent pork with nice use of spices and herbs...the fennel was great.

All the sandwiches came with a small house salad on the plate..... generally $9... a good deal for high quality food.

Lowlights. ........
...........................

Most of the staff was very helpful and service was fast.  BUT....I feel the same way as other reviewers about the hostess behind the counter....she has zero flexibility. ...my wife is not as adventurous with food and wanted the beef sandwich without the hot relish....she preferred some lettuce on the sandwich......easy right?  Nope....no can do.....did I mention earlier that a salad came on the plate?  They could not move a couple of leafs of lettuce on the sandwich?   I should mention that at the time of ordering, we did not know that there was a side salad included so we were super perplexed about the lack of flexibility.   Obviously,  the world did not end because of this but it showed a weird complete lack of customer service.

But forget the lowlight....the food is awesome....real good, authentic italian food!   Try it."}
{"text":"This is absolutely delicious Italian food. Their pasta is as good as I've had anywhere, ever. Fish is outstanding. Bread is amazing. I also like that the owner lets his personality show, from the family photos to the cheeky signs (example: \"No, we don't have Wifi. Talk to each other!\")  They are pricey but everything is top quality and done with love. Gruff love. But love.

Tip: they have incredible pizzas. On Wednesday and Saturday only. After 6:15 pm. Tuesday at 7 pm? Sorry. Saturday at 5:45 pm? Outta luck. Wednesday and Saturday after 6:15 pm only. Like I say, this is a family-run place and they do things their way.  Just go with it. You'll thank me."}
{"text":"Awesome Italian deli!! It's probably better if you speak Italian  The arancini is amazing here, as well as all the sandwiches! Their bread is amazing and definitely give their pizza a try!"}
{"text":"First things first, every time I have been here the pasta is cooked perfectly and the fish is some of the freshest I've ever tasted. Homemade sauces are fabulous, the owner, Giovanni, is friendly and welcoming, and Rosario, will cater to your every need. 

I have read the negative reviews, and surprised at how taken aback that people are that fresh, homemade food and desserts are \"expensive.\" I guess Olive Garden works for some, but if you want truly homemade, catch of the day come here. Ask for Giovani, I've never received bad service and neither has the dozens of people I have sent here."}
{"text":"This is a great Italian sandwich shop, I had The Bastardo and added some of the fresh anchovies on the side which are delicious!"}
{"text":"Cool place and neat ambiance. Food was delicious. Very overpriced and portions were smaller than I'd have liked. I was hungry when I left. Staff was nice. I'd maybe return... If I hit the lottery big and money wasn't an issue... Otherwise,  ehhhh."}
{"text":"Wanted a nice quality local place to celebrate an anniversary and couldn't have more disappointed with their service or lack thereof. Food is good to exceptional but expensive and all is spoiled with the lack of any attention at all. Had to carry a partial bottle of wine to the order 'window' to get a cork and check! I'll WAIT a long time  before returning."}
{"text":"Family run restaurant- incredible food, wine, desert! Would recommend 100%! Will be back!! Give them a try, you will not be disappointed! Great family atmosphere! If you don't know what to order, trust anything the staff recommends! You will not be disappointed regardless!"}
{"text":"Went with friends and we had a great time! A wonderful, comfortable Italian casual dining experience. Our favorite is the grilled calamari which is just so delicious. The grilled calamari is cooked to the perfection; never chewy and the sauce is amazing so light and delicious. We also had the antipasto plate with lots of salami, olives, cheese and his homemade prosciutto which is so very good lean and not salty like some. We had the carpaccio thinly sliced raw beef on a bed of greens with a light dressing drizzled with lemon; excellent. We also one of the specials that night the gnocchi with a bolognese sauce. the gnocchi were light and the sauce was wonderful and meaty. Combine all of that with wonderful homemade bread dipped in olive oil and a good house red wine and you have the making of a great Italian meal. Topped off with  cannoli and espresso for dessert. Perfectly made espresso - short pour like you get in Italy and  great cannoli. Crispy shells with the wonderful creamy ricotta cheese in the center. He makes them exactly like they should be made; filling goes in when you order so the shell stay crisp."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to get a yummy dinner but something togo and came across Andreoli's. The name was perfect as this is my maiden last name. I couldn't help but check this place out. Pulling into the parking lot i could see the name and my heart got so excited. The team working were welcoming and I could hear them speaking Italian. We ordered togo the #3 and #9 sandwiches and a slice of amaretto cake and a cannolli. The bread was fresh and perfect for holding the well prepared ingredients! Dessert did not disappoint!  Loved the flavors. Just how they should be. Can't wait to go back and next time bring an empty suitcase so I can bring home some items from the grocery area. Looking forward to wearing the Andreoli shirt when I get home."}
{"text":"Andreoli is an incredible find. If your looking for \"true\" Italian cooking this is the place for you. Some items are a little pricey, but you must realize everything is made with the best ingredients in the highest quality. House made pasta, bread, the best deli meat and cheeses  and baked goods. My favorite is the Caio sandwich , every simple but packed with so much flavor. Next time I will step out of my comfort and order a pasta dish."}
{"text":"Have been coming to this great little restaurant for years! Was shocked this last visit when I ordered the tuna sandwich, what I actually got was a tomato sandwich with tuna sprinkled on it. Not sure what they are doing but it's not working!"}
{"text":"When I found out Andreoli was made famous by Guy Fieri, I had to check it out.  I find pure joy in verifying his claims.  Not every joint he claims to fame is a home run.  But in this case, I can confidently say it was a buzzard beater winner, chicken dinner.  

Instead of trying to remember every single dish we had I will just say, everything was fantastico!  Upon ordering, the gentleman behind the counter kindly recommended to us to get something with seafood and sure enough it was spot on good.  The squid, clams, shrimp, and scallops were cooked perfectly.  Not rubbery at all.  Each came in some kind of pasta--risotto or spaghetti.  All prepared in classic al dente in fused with light, hearty flavor that reminds you of grandma's cooking.

I saved the best for last which is their carpaccio cold salad.  The presentation provoked salivation which then led us to beefgasm to the Nth degree.  The thinly sliced almost raw beef just melted in your mouth accompanied by the fresh salad and thin, transparent cheese.  

I partially lied about confirming on Guy Fieri's claim since none of these were what he actually ate but I am basically trusting his word as first impression on the mentioned foods were memorable and outstanding.  The reason why we couldn't try the foods he had was because one of them was out of season while the other was recommended as a lunch item.

Not much else to say except to come check them out.  The wallet might take a big hit, but you will gain a much deeper respect for Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"BEST italian food in Arizona. So authentic. Great vibe. Homemade everything. Giovanni is a 5 star chef. You need to go!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Little hard to find (or maybe it was just me), but well worth it.  Sausage sandwich is definitely a thing a do again.  Tomato and mozzarella was also good.  Bread on both sandwiches was outstanding.

Didn't order desert, but they had a bunch of stuff that looked really good."}
{"text":"Found this place on Diners and Drive-ins and it lives up to the comments. The food is super good. I highly recommend stopping in for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the sweets as we had family coming in from California and they are full blooded Italian.  We had the pistachio cake, croissant, cookies, and a spiral croissant and Italian bread.  Yes the price was higher than normal, but just because it doesn't have a bunch of fancy restaurant environment, it doesn't mean the food isn't amazing.  Each dessert we tasted was very very good.  If treating yourself or family once in a while, spend the extra and get higher quality.  We also got their Italian bread and the two Italians in our family thought it was to die for, so thats two votes."}
{"text":"If you love Italian food, it doesn't get any better or more authentic.
My wife and decided to go here after a recommendation from friends. So we stopped by for lunch. My wife had a very nice Caprese (Burrata) salad and I had an Arugula, Prosciutto and shaved Parmesan salad with a lemon aoli dressing.  Simple but OMG so good. We liked it so much we came back for dinner. I highly recommend this place. I can recommend the grilled calamari. Old wooden tables give it a rustic warm atmosphere. The service is great"}
