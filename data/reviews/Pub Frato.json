{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Fun variety of tacos.  Tried the tempura shrimp and beef.  Both top notch.  Very attentive and pleasant service."}
{"text":"A well deserved 5 stars for Pub Frato!  We started with the pretzel appetizer which came out piping hot with a delicious pub cheese and mustard sauce. Each were excellent.  Our entrées included a burger, cubano and buffalo tacos. A+ all around. The server was attentive, friendly and helpful. Definitely headed back!"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Beer, Great Atmosphere.  The only thing that's disappointing is that the place is often packed. This is a negative symptom of a positive quality."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place. Great drink specials. Most importantly this place had the best hot soft pretzel I've ever had. And that's saying a lot."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch yesterday with my son and he insisted on sitting at the bar, which I never do. I always thought you'd get better service at a table but this wasn't the case. The bartender was friendly and helpful with making food and drink choices. Had tacos and a burger, it may be the best burger I've had. Great place, great service."}
{"text":"Excited to have a place with great food and drinks right around the corner! I have been here twice and each time everything was great."}
{"text":"Great place.  It's small so seating can be difficult but totally worth it.  The buffalo chicken sandwich is awesome.  My wife loved the buffalo chicken mac-n-cheese.  Our friends both ordered the smoked brisket patty melt and it was fantastic.  Great menu.  It's small and not overwhelming.  Everything we've tried has been good.  Great beer selection as well.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"great small bar!!! people are really nice food is outstanding and no riff raff. prices are okay, little expensive but that's how you keep all the trash out. I will be going back again hopefully a seat at the bar! place was packed full by 5pm Friday. want some advice call ahead"}
{"text":"Right from the get go we were greeted with a friendly smile. The staff was cheerful and helpful. The menu contained something for everyone from a picky boy to a vegetarian daughter. The blackened chicken sandwich was likely the best chicken sandwich I've had. Not at all dry and very tasty (although I would have liked more heat in the seasoning). My husband had the Pub burger and rated it near the top of his all all time best. The truffle fries were good but the aioli made it. We were simply passing through but this would be a great place to hang out and have a couple of drinks with the posse."}
{"text":"Pub Frato is my favorite place to go out for food and drinks. Extensive beer menu and very contentious staff. Steph (bartender) and Alexa are awesome. Pub burger and brisket sandwich are out of this world. Every meal has been savory and breathtaking up to this point. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love this Pub!  I have been here 3 times in the past few months and have never been disappointed.  I'm looking forward to soups back on the menu in the Fall.  Everything we've ordered has been delicious and as described.  My friend enjoyed his Moscow Mule with a special ginger beer. The service is attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.  We are planning to return this week and take advantage of some fabulous happy hour food and drink specials. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"In the last few weeks, have been here once for lunch and once for dinner. Menu is well-edited. Salmon was perfectly cooked, crisp on outside and still moist inside. BLT was great, made with a tomato mix instead of slices, very good. Pretzel appetizer was fantastic. Only complaint was that our table was near door and every time someone walked in, we were blasted with cold air."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice. We have been lucky enough to get seats at the bar because most of the tables are reserved. We prefer to sit at the bar anyways. The place seems to fill up quickly on weekends. They have a nice beer selection but the food is why I come here. The pot roast pierogies are awesome and if my mom made brussel sprouts like this place I would have eaten them all the time. The staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"My husband and I were expecting to love this place as much as other yelp reviewers did and as much as we typically like a place with this kind of style.  We were disappointed based on such high expectations, but if we would have gone in to Pub Frato with a lower expectations, I suppose we may not have been as disappointed as we were.  We enjoyed the drinks we ordered and the selection of cocktails, drafts, and bottled drinks.  We also liked our artichoke app, and the pub sauce on the wings was amazing.    My husband thoroughly enjoyed his pub burger, but i was disappointed with my meal of buffalo chicken tacos with a side of fries.  I love a buffalo-chicken-anything, and this had a bit more of a bbq flavor.... maybe it was the cole slaw or something?  The side of \"hand cut fries\" that were plated with my meal were like someone scraped the bottom of the fryer basket for the little crispy broken fries that didn't make the cut; especially when compared to the normal serving that came with my husband's.  Our main disappointment was with the service.   We consider ourselves pretty laid-back diners, and we have both worked in food service and have an understanding for what makes service appear slow for diners, at times; there was no excuse for the slowness of our service at the bar.   We would try to make eye contact with our bartender to order something, and she'd pass by, maybe five times, until we eventually had to call to her.... when she would pass by, it wasn't because she was busy making drinks, taking an order, or checking on someone, etc,  but because she was just leisurely strolling around, looking at her watch, chatting with other servers, etc. The other servers hung out under the spiral staircase most of the evening chatting, and would depart every once in a while to check on a table here or there.  I can only assume this is normal.  Menu: 5 stars Food prep: 4 stars Service: 2 stars."}
{"text":"Everything about our visit was awesome. Service was quick, courteous and extremely helpful. Food was amazing; from appetizer of pierogis with short ribs to buffalo chicken and  Mac and cheese. Drinks were very liquorey-I had the Moscow Mule and he had the Long Island. We will be back for sure! Super delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped off the highway based on the Yelp rating.   I wish we could have given them 6-stars.   Food was tremendous and our server, Bobby,  was friendly,  knowledgeable,  and incredibly attentative.  I must visit"}
{"text":"I LOVE Pub Frato! I recently started working off of Auburn Rd. and have been to Pub Frato several times for lunch and once for dinner. The food is fantastic and staff is great. Stephanie is awesome. The Graciella salad is amazing and the shrimp tacos are to die for!"}
{"text":"I love the apps here but trying to infuse sweet and savory in most dishes needs a little work. Too many favors for one dish. Had the grilled cheese that had a gooey sweet onion sauce that sort of tasted like sweet and sour sauce and did not compliment well. My date had the pub burger, tasty but again sweet tasting. Just want clean, crisp, favors but I got way too many favors and confused the palate. Had nice but untrained waitress that knew nothing about wines, beers, or liquors to make good recommendations. Will pass on main courses next time and stick to apps."}
{"text":"My favorite hometown gem!  Amazing food and cocktails!  The staff is very friendly and courteous.  We frequent Pub Frato and the shrimp tacos and raspberry Long Island iced teas never disappoint!  I refer PF to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Service is horrible. They do not make eye contact. No acknowledgement. By the way , it's Tuesday night at. 530. Not busy and they are actually just standing around. Took 10 minutes to orders beer while sitting at the bar with 2 bartenders and what appeared to be a manager. I actually was getting ready to walk out when a waitress noticed and asked me if if like to order and sent over a bartender who referred to me as \" this guy\"."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. Was staying at the Quail Hollow Resort for a wedding and a group of us were looking for a place to grab a quick lunch. Couldn't have picked a better spot. Staff was extremely friendly and the food was delicious. Had the chicken tacos which were delightful. Friend had some sort of grilled cheese sandwich that looked amazing. Great selection of local beers as well."}
{"text":"Great find! Food was great - best french fries ever, pierogies are awesome, sandwiches are perfection. Reasonable prices and fast friendly service make this casual place worth a drive, and the full bar will keep everyone happy!"}
{"text":"I do not understand the hype around this place. The first time we tried to eat here we were told it would be an indefinite amount of time until we'd be seated yet there were a few empty tables. The second time I went in we were seated but had very slow service. We ordered the bone marrow which was ok but a bit too burnt so we felt shafted on how much marrow we actually got. I ordered the chicken tacos and they were just okay. Not dying to go back here although I know it's a concord favorite for some."}
{"text":"Tasty treats! Love their pretzels and cheese. Mac and cheese was really good too. Hip atmosphere you don't expect to find in Concord. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great Food but takes a bit of time so be patient. Great beer list and great staff. The only negative is that the place is too loud.  Yes I'm in my 40s but I love pubs and everything about them; here it's quite difficult to have conversation when it's busy and going to a pub is all about conversation. They are turning off potential repeat clients by not fixing this."}
{"text":"Wow.  Chop salad, shrimp tempura tacos (like NOBU in Malibu) and the Side of Mac & cheese (I'm from the south, Mac and cheese snob, best I've ever had in a restaurant-get the side, not the fancy fixings) sooooooo good. Visiting from NYC for a cousins wedding and found this gem! Plus, the staff was Incredible-if I lived here I'd be here every day!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Pub Frato for the first time today for a light dinner.  My wife had a cocktail and then ordered the buffalo chicken taco and I ordered the grilled cheese BLT sandwich along with an ice tea. My wife really enjoyed her tacos that came with fries. The tacos had a little bit of kick to them, but not overpowering. The fries were more than she could finish. My grilled cheese BLT was phenomenal, the best grilled cheese sandwich I ever had.  The sandwich came with fries as well.  I would highly recommend this sandwich. The interior of the pub was very modern and clean.  We got seated in the dining area away from the bar area which was very much appreciated, as we prefer quiet dining.  The only drawback for me was that we were seated at the first table as you enter the dining area, and my seat was right up against the wall with a heavy curtain drawn to one side, next to my chair, which constantly was at my side.  If the table was moved a foot away from the entrance, the curtain would not have been a problem.  It is either that or take the curtain down. Our waiter,Bob, was really attentive, and provided excellent service. I would not hesitate to come back and try some of the other dishes on the menu.  We really enjoyed the dinner."}
{"text":"Swimming families ...if you go to Spire for a meet....this is a must go to place...great staff....great brews....and excellent food....the shredded roast beef pirogies are a must."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and the first thing that I noticed it was a very small place that was packed with people. It took about 20 minutes before a table opened up and we were seated. The selection of beer is outstanding. I had the golden Belgium Monkey as well as fish and chips for dinner.  Both were good and highly recommended. Service was also outstanding."}
{"text":"Love it!  I guess I'm biased because it's within walking distance of my house? Hard to resist the prezel app and everthing on the menu is good. Drink specials on Thursday nights too! Us hospital workers love to call in our lunches and have it ready when we get there :)"}
{"text":"To start, we are from Chicago. One of the great food hubs of the US.  We went here while visiting family and Pub Frato was a GREAT experience!   First let me say the service was IMPECCABLE. Everyone was friendly and attentive and LOOKED YOU IN THE EYE. The beer selection and bar specials we fantastic! $1 bottle beer is un heard. We started with the charcuterie plate and everything was as good as it could be. We also got the pretzel...wow was that good. The white cheese sauce I could of taken a few shots of!   For the main course we got shrimp tacos, braised short rib tacos and the pub burger. The shrimp tacos were flavorful and the shrimp were plump and well cooked. The burger as perfectly done with bacon and a runny fried egg, yum! The best was the braised short rib tacos... HOLY COW! They were absolutely delicious. The meat was so tender and the goat cheese on them added some acidity which it needed because the meat was so rich! Great meal!  Overall this place deserves every bit of 5 stars. Whomever wrote previous reviews with 1 star must of came right when they opened because there was absolutely nothing I did not like about the place and would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"The service is off the chain good. If you get Michelle thats a great start. Order the Montréal poutine...with the fried egg. You wont be disappointed. The braised brisket and cod tacos will knock your sox off. Will definitely be back. Tuesday you can mix up your taco order. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Great place!  I have the buffalo chicken sandwich with slaw on top and my wife had the risotto with scallops.   Both dishes were fantastic and perfectly prepared.  For dessert I had the not your fathers root beer float, and holy sh!t was it good.  The atmosphere was great in this place, very modern."}
{"text":"Great service and nice atmosphere. We had the soft pretzel and the wings appetizer and both were delicious. The brisket sandwich and cheeseburger were awesome. Wish we would have tried the Mac and Cheese because every table had ordered some. Other diners said it is the best! You can pair your burger or sandwich with some great sides. Next time we are ordering the famous tacos. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"In response to Lydia's comment; I've been here countless times and I love it. However, I've had my fair share of disappointments at this establishment ( 3 separate occasions), and the common denominator has been that general manager. Always left a bad taste in my mouth. I give this three stars because my last experience was with Alexa, and she was amazing!"}
{"text":"Best bistro pub food! Pierogi was brisket and goat cheese, with amazing flavors sweet and tangy,  pretzels are homemade and a meal in itself, friend loved the burger and truffle fries  The Graciella salad is amazing, fresh spring mix with amazing flavors, spicy nuts, sweet onion, and champagne vinaigrette is excellence in simple food. We had lunch while visiting Ohio and couldn't wait to go back. Stopped in a second time and and if closer to Mentor would have been there daily."}
{"text":"Five stars for food!! Amazing food, and drinks! -1 stars for the blonde hostess. Had to greet her when we walked in and ask if we just seat ourselves. She told us no it's full till 8:30. Not apologetic or anything. Worst Coustomer service I've come across in a while. Pub Frato please hire someone with manners!!!!"}
{"text":"I should say that I consider myself a foodie.  I travel quite a bit for work and get to experience all sorts of cuisine.  Well let me say this - my wife and I moved into the neighborhood about 30 days ago.  Today I stopped here on a whim for lunch...  all I can say is wow!  The atmosphere is amazingly clean, sophisticated, and classy!  I was really impressed.  After making a few choices from the menu, our food came out...  1 word... WOW!!  I now live 1 mile from here and will be a frequent flyer!!!  Tacos and sandwiches were our choice during trip 1!  5 stars!!  Nice work Pub Frato!!!"}
{"text":"When staying in Concord this has become our go-to place for good quality food and drinks. Admittedly the competition isn't great in the area, but Pub Frato could compete anywhere. It's a gastro pub so the food quality is several notches above a normal sports bar, and the menu is constantly being tweaked. The decor and atmosphere is about as cool as one can get in a shopping center. (Speaking of a shopping center, this happens to be located in a newer shopping center which itself has nicer curb appeal than most).  The food is delicious and consistent. If you're going on Taco Night (Tuesday) be prepared to wait or see if they will let you reserve a table for larger tables. The tacos are great but hungry people will require at least 4 or 5 to feel full so keep that in mind (they're small in other words). Of special note are the parmesean truffle fries. They are the best around. Our entire family goes there just for them. I am gluten-free and while they don't have a special menu or a separate prep area, the staff is always knowledgeable and they'll work with you. I've also never had any digestive issues after eating there. (That being said, it's 2016 so it's probably time for management to mark gluten free items on the menu or at least have a separate paper menu to help the newer servers.) If you're in the area, this is the place to eat for upscale pub dining."}
{"text":"If you're on the prowl for a taco Tuesday, this is the place to go! Not your typical beef taco, but think outside of the box. Next level $2 tempura shrimp, roasted eggplant, & chicken, just to name a few. I'm very happy that there were Vegetarian options on the taco menu for this most sacred day.   Reservations are recommended for the Taco Tuesdays. The vibe was very cozy, with a farmhouse meets Steampunk kinda decor. The staff was very attentive and friendly. Drinks and food were all on point. I can't wait to go back and explore the rest of their menu. Highly  recommend Pub Frato."}
{"text":"We were just driving around trying to find a place for dinner and a few drinks this weekend and stumbled upon Pub Frato... I am so glad we did!  Walking in, I immediately liked the cool vibe that the place gave off; it seemed like it could easily be picked up and moved to Tremont and fit in perfectly.  There were no tables available right away, but we ordered drinks at the bar and only had to wait about 10 minutes before we were seated, so that was no problem at all!  As an appetizer, we ordered the truffle fries-yum! The garlic aoli stole the show on this dish.  My entree was amazing!  I had the macaroni and cheese which was made with Gruyere and cheddar cheeses and topped with herb cracker crumbs.  It was cheesy, gooey, and perfect!  The portion size is HUGE (yay leftovers!), and I was definitely happy with what I ordered.    My boyfriend ordered the flat iron steak, and his plate came out looking gorgeous; the presentation was worthy of any \"fancy\" restaurant.  He was pleasantly surprised since he isn't the biggest fan of \"hip place,\" preferring to go into tried and true favorites.  He licked his plate clean... not even a kernel of the corn succotash was left in the red wine reduction swirled around the plate.  There is a huge selection of beers and a fun cocktail list, so this would be a fun place to stop for just a couple of drinks too!   Something else to note that I thought was unique is that they have a \"communal table\" so that smaller parties can sit together and meet others in the area... kind of a fun idea!    I am very glad we came in to Pub Frato, and I will be returning when I am in the area"}
{"text":"This was a great place to eat.  The look and fell of bar is modern country feels.  Using a reclaimed design feel.   The only complaint I had was not enough sausage on the stuffed peppers.  They were still good.   I had the kielbasa sandwich. Was really good. To many flavors going on but good.  My girlfriend at burger and wedge salad.  She was so happy with flavor and juiciness of burger.   The staff was nice fun and outgoing.    All and all I would go back."}
{"text":"First time at Pub Frato. Great selection of drinks. Friendly service. Ordered the excellent Brisket sandwich with truffle fries. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Oh my! How have I not expressed my love for this place yet! \"The Pub\" as we call it is one of our favorites. They have great .... everything. From the burgers to fries to salads to beverages, you can not go wrong. I would call ahead if possible, because on any given night this is a hot spot. But you can always grab a drink at the bar and wait for your table. The menu tends to change on occasion but I never have a problem finding something new and delicious to try. The service is friendly, fast and efficient.  *Pretzel is amazing. The salt and dips are key. *Mac-n-cheese --- ohhhh myyyy!!! Monday night special fyi. *Salads - half or full I think all are amazing! *Fries - alone or with any of the topping options are delicious! *Weeknight specials are great!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the atmosphere!!!  Shrimp tacos and truffle fries are AMAZING!!!  Staff is very friendly.  Great selection of beer and wine. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"So yummy!!! I am not a burger person but the burger with melted Brie was to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Best food and drinks around. Very small so go early or make reservations for dinner. Menu changes every few months. Have eaten here several times and every meal has been great!"}
{"text":"Pub frato is a great place for us to stop since it's right in front of our development.  I usually ordered the Brussel sprouts and quinoa which are side dishes but I get them as my dinner because I love them so much !!!!! This is a great spot to grab a drink with friends.  The only thing missing is a patio."}
{"text":"We stopped in here with some friends unbeknownst to us they had already had dinner, therefore my wife and I had to grab something to eat while they were drinking. However the evening started with us at the bar, waiting for the table which is fine with me. I started out with two cousins draft beer which must be somewhere around 50% alcohol because they hit me like a rock!  The bartender was able to transfer our tab over to the table which is not a common practice but I tip to the bartender anyway. Once we got your table we have 3 or 4 more beers and ended up ordering some light snacks. After all this place is not known for large heavy meals and the whole light snack motif is apparent.  Now I have been to bars before that had a Tater Tot obsession and when you order tater tots they serve you mountains of tater tots topped with every bit of cheese and bacon it seems Northeast Ohio has to offer. However when we ordered tater tots here what we got was much different than what I was expecting. What we received, although delicious, was five tater tots. 5. The tater tots were just a little larger than normal and they appeared to be handmade and came with a couple different dipping sauces. However I wish the menu would have said hey you going to get just five tater tots with this. It was easily remedied by ordering another round of tater tots, but I just kind of wish they would have disclosed that it was not your normal Northeast Ohio mountain of tater tots. Our server was attentive, easy to flag down, table was cleaned off, and the check was brought promptly when we when we asked for it.  Overall it was a really enjoyable night but I think they are too maybe include some pictures in their menu."}
{"text":"Great food selection and drinks! Wonderful staff! Weekly specials are really good as are the mixed drinks! They change their menu so there's always something new to try every few months!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with a large group of coworkers. We had called three weeks prior to make the reservation and an employee called the day before to confirm our reservation and number of guests. We were also told at this time, that they would need to make room for another small party at 6:00, but we could still have several tables. The night started off ok, but it was obvious that the restaurant can't handle large groups. We asked about specials and were told by one server that the restaurant doesn't have any specials. This was clarified after we all placed our first order. We had to wait for drink refills and several people from our party never got their meals. Our server did the best job she could, but lacked additional help. At one point, she put her hand up to us and asked us to wait. It was obvious she was frustrated. Then, we were told we had to move because the restaurant had additional reservations, so we stood at the bar where service was still lacking. The food and drinks were good, but I was not impressed with the service and the way we were treated."}
{"text":"Elote Gnocchi is the best item I've had here in over 2 years of being very very frequent. Kudos to the chef."}
{"text":"Great place to get a beer and some elevated level bar food. The menu selection is diverse but not too big so everything is well executed. The burgers and tacos are particularly great."}
{"text":"I stayed a the hotel across the street and wanted something light and a beer.  This is a very attractive establishment.   I sat at the bar and waited a little while for someone to come to me.  It wasn't busy.  I ordered a nice double IPA and an order of wings.  She said she wastn't sure if they still had the wings but checked and came back and said yes they did.  The wings were terrible.  They must've been in the deep fryer since March.  Dried out to the point where the meat was tasteless.  The barmaid didn't come by for a long time.  She was too busy laughing it up with other help and a regular, at the other end of the bar.  I had to ask the bus boy to get my waitress.  When she came back I told her I had two things, one the wings were terrible.  She (to her credit) immediately said she'd take them off the bill.  I thanked her and when she came back I told her that I owned a bar/restaurant and she was not very attentive.  She said she was sorry I had a bad experience.  When in the area again, I will not go back here."}
{"text":"Wow...in town for work and found this place. Amazing service, fun/active bar and the beer selection is 5 stars! But the food was a huge surprise. I don't know who is in the kitchen but they are in their prime. The food was extremely good and memorable after a few more great beers. I will go out of my way to find a way back."}
{"text":"Stopped in by chance, and because of a great bartender  they served a party of 20 that night. Food was on point, staff was excellent, atmosphere was very good and the house beer is award winning. Definitely recommend a visit.  California"}
{"text":"Drinks and food are great! And when I say food I actually just mean brisket because why would I try anything else. Maybe next time I will venture elsewhere on the menu, but loved the brisket pierogies and patty melt."}
{"text":"Lunch was awesome. Awesome decor. Very clean. Service was good to boot. We stopped in last minute driving through and had lunch. I had the grilled chicken sandwich and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Awesome find!  We live in Mentor and just never have gone and decided to give it a try.  After our first visit, we went back 2 more times within a few weeks.  GREAT happy hour, GREAT staff and just a nice and cozy restaurant/bar.  One of our favorite places to go now.  It's tucked in a small shopping plaza but in a up and coming location with a lot of other places to go eat, drink & shop.  We're so glad to have found this little gem in Concord."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times. It is a great option for someplace a little different on the east side where we have too many chains. I have loved about everything I've ordered. The value with pricing seems inconsistent depending on what you order but over all good. I've gotten the Brussel sprouts small plate that has come mounded and could be a side dish for 4 and another time I ordered the roasted beets small plate for the same price and savored my 4 tiny bites of diced beets. The graciella salad, grilled cheese BLT and the tacos are excellent. One suggestion to the chef would be on the pub wedge. Had a friend order it and it came out presented on a chopping board loaded to the edges and dressed, clever, but she couldn't cut it to eat it without it going all over our table! Cocktail menu is fun. Debated between 4-5 stars but have to agree... the service, while not bad, could be better. Nice trendy option for the area and we find ourselves going back again and again!"}
{"text":"Great place and environment!  Fun place ! Very nice appetizers ! Definitely one of my favorite pubs"}
{"text":"We walked and there's no place to stand to have a drink and basically we had to walk out.  Unless we wanted to stand next to people sitting at a table eating their meals or stand in the aisle we were out of luck. The bar is very small and not accommodating to coming in for just a drink.  Possibly if we came earlier we may have gotten a table. It's not a place I would plan on getting together with a group."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, staff is sooo friendly and beers are great. Such a great addition to the Concord area. Reservations needed on weekends, but a great place to go for a beer. Best dishes we've had are the Poutine (currently not on the menu), salads, fish tacos, burger, wings, and perogies. Just a nice change of pace from the Red Hawk/Panini atmosphere. We would be \"regulars\" if we didn't have kids! :)"}
{"text":"Overall the food and service was good. I felt the entrees were overpriced for the entree quality. Half off beer on Thursday was a plus and attracted us to the pub. They also do half off Wine on Wednesday's. I would only go back for the drink specials. Seems like a popular spot for the options in that area."}
{"text":"Very nice facility with a friendly staff. The food is priced well, worth it for the taste. Desert was great too!"}
{"text":"An excellent local restaurant with a nice, varied selection of dishes. The beer is good, the food is tasty, and the atmosphere is excellent. Always a great dinner date."}
{"text":"Everything I've had to eat here is fabulous! The pub burger is the best damn burger around. I love it so much that I dream about it at night!"}
{"text":"Pub Frato is a local favorite! Pretty much everything is great and hands down the cod fish tacos are a fan favorite. Great drink selection and atmosphere. Love their brunch too! Make sure to make a reservation or get there early because they fill up quick!"}
{"text":"Really good beer selection. Really noisy but it was a saturday. Pub burger on point. Subpar service but oh well. Oh really good salad too. Would come back."}
{"text":"So disappointed in our experience at Pub Frato tonight.  We have eaten there several times.  Made reservations on the 27th of December for a birthday.  No problem and there were 10 of us on a Saturday Made reservations for tonight for hubby's birthday.  Got there at 7.  Food was ok, service slow.  We were told around 9 that we would have to move to the bar in 20 minutes.  We were told we should have been advised when we made the reservation  of the time limit or by the hostess when she seated us.  Neither happened.  Will not go back.  Will not recommend ever again to any friends.  Actually embarrassed after tonight that I ever did.    Did have a great 2 piece band.  Would have loved to have stayed longer just to hear them."}
{"text":"First timer, and this place rocks. Can't wait to go back. Get the pretzel app.  Get the tacos. Get the Mac & Cheese. Everything is great."}
{"text":"Came in from Chicago for some lunch -- this place was perfect. Great tap selection, burgers were great, and Kate was awesome. Trendy and quiet."}
{"text":"Nice pub. Good variety of beers. We loved the tacos. They were tasty and just the right size. The menu has something for everyone. We've been in multiple times. The last time the waitress was new (maybe) so service was spotty and she got multiple things wrong with our order, however, she and the manager corrected it and even took it off our bill. Kudos for a well run establishment trying to keep customers happy! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place as we have hardly any dining options in Chardon and this place is fairly close. We were not disappointed. The service was great and we truly enjoyed our food. I had the pork tacos with yuca chips, my honey have a salad with shrimp and we shared an appetizer. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've never been treated so rudely and felt so embarrassed at a restaurant/bar before.  It was a Friday night at 10:30 and the bar had ~10 people in it. I ordered an old fashioned. I kept an eye on the bartender making it. He added a little too many cherries, so it ended up bright red. A little forgivable. But when he poured it into the glass, the volume came up short and he topped it with water. Not as forgivable. I gave my drink a chance for a couple of sips/5 minutes or so, but I could definitely taste that it was watered down and heavy on the sugar.   So I politely asked for a more accurate old fashioned. The bartender did admit to being heavy on the cherries and seemed to happily make a new one.  I got my new old fashioned. It was better. My friend who had never had an old fashioned asked to take a sip. I had another sip. All is good.  Then out of nowhere, the bartender storms over grabs my drink. He literally flings it's contents into the sink and slams a recipe list in front of me and yells, \"This is what is in an old fashioned, if you don't like it!\" And storms away to the back.   I'm stunned and drinkless.  I have no explanation for why this happened. He didn't ask if I liked my new drink better. He just made an assumption and made me feel horrible. The only guess I could have is if he saw my friend's reaction to the old fashioned, as she doesn't drink liquor-heavy drinks often? But even then, his response was completely childish.   A female bartender then approached us and asked what happened. She was nice and offered another drink to me --- which I was too stunned to take her up on. She asked again and comped our drinks which is the only reason this review has 2 stars.   I asked if there was a manager to talk to, but the male bartender that acted so childish was the manager! I couldn't believe it. This is the stuff you see on Bar Rescue or Undercover Diners.   I want to like Pub Frato. I've been here one other time. The ambiance, decor, and menu is superb for the area. But the service and execution of standard drinks that are not on the menu has to match the external presentation.   As of right now, I'm very leery of returning."}
{"text":"We made a reservation and were seated quickly. The premise here is, improved versions of pub classics. Service was very good. Our group had burgers, fish and chips, smoked brisket patty melt, mac and cheese, and fish tacos. I'm not sure why I can't bring myself to give it 5 stars. I'm just having trouble wrapping my head around charging $12 for mac and cheese. I don't know, I just left with the feeling that no matter how good I thought they were, they think they're much better. It's a nice spot though, unless you're looking for value (i.e not paying more for what you actually get)."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out on a Friday evening to celebrate a recent promotion. I called to make reservations for 2 earlier that afternoon, which was no problem. We arrived 15 minutes early and were told our table wasn't ready yet, also not a problem. We decided to get drinks & sit at the bar. Got good service there. 6:30 comes around & we notice the hostess hasn't even come over - we had to grab her to ask about our table. We waited another 5 minutes.   Once at a tabletop in the back, we waited over 10 minutes before being served. The waitress tried to act like it wasn't her fault (she was the one serving our area). We immediately ordered knowing this was our chance. Got the Brussels Sprouts - delicious. My boyfriend got the Pub Burger which he enjoyed, but thought the patty was a previously packaged kind. I ordered 2 sides - vegetable quinoa & pierogies. Wait time wasn't bad for the food. It was all yummy too. However, I found a hair in my food that definitely was not mine. We complained & the waitress took it back (mind you, we're right by the kitchen). A couple minutes later she said they'll make me a new plate & take it off the bill. But literally a few minutes after that, the runner came back with the quinoa & my fork that I had left on my plate. They gave me the same plate & food back!! I knew when I saw the pepper I put on it as well as my fork. I couldn't believe it!  While food & drinks were good, the service was terrible enough for us to never return."}
{"text":"We go here all the time, probably the best restaurant in the area. Mentor is the capital of terrible chain restaurants so it's a relief to have Pub Frato. The beer selection is great and the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"So after this facility had been open for about eight weeks, we decided to give it a try. Figuring that after eight weeks they would no longer be \"in the weeds\".   We had planned on having dinner there that night. The food that we saw coming out looked great and we had a really good feeling about the place, diverse clientele lots of happy chatter and very busy.   However the longer we sat there as more people came in,  it became so loud we couldn't hear ourselves think. The food looked great, but conversation was impossible. High ceilings and absolutely no acoustic tiles or baffles.  After 2 drinks we finally gave up and tried another place for dinner.   Next time instead of going in on a Friday will try for Tuesday."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful family/locally owned business.  Such a unique spot with tons of charm.  The serving staff are great, and the only possible downside is that it's so popular that sometimes it's hard to get a table without a reservation.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I eat lunch here every week.  I love the food...especially the grasiella (sp?) salad.  The pub burger is awesome with chicken as a substitute!  I love the flavors the chef puts together! The tacos are also awesome!  The dinner specials are unique and the owner does a great job with decorating for the season.  Love the interior design.  Lots of fun things have gone on over the year...bloody mary bar, ugly sweater party, live music...to name just a few.  It truly is a meet and eat kind of place.  I'm from the Westside of Cleveland and ran into an old colleague from years ago.  Great place to go!"}
{"text":"Really good gastropub food and a good selection of beer and booze. Nice brunch, we had bennies and they were awesome"}
{"text":"Was driving by and decided to give it a try.   It was a Wednesday and their special is a bottle of wine for 1/2 price.   Took advantage of that and wife and I had salads which were very good.   I had the Graciella salad with salmon and she had a chopped salad with chicken.   All the other plates coming out looked really good.  Lots of craft beers, both on tap and in bottles.  Our server was great.   Brought us several wine tastes before we decided on one.   Very helpful with food selection.  Wish I could remember her name -   had short red hair.  Thank You!  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Don't pay extra for the truffle fries.  I used to love them, but they changed the way they make them, and according to the waiter, it's staying that way.  We were very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nice place, seems like a good local spot. Good beer selection, bartenders were cordial. But that's the reason for a three star. Ordered the \"smoked\" brisket patty melt with horseradish aioli. First the only thing that was smoke was the chef who prepared it. Not even close to being a smoked brisket. More like a boiled brisket. Horseradish aoli, no way. Had nothing on it. The toast was so buttery \"grill butter\" that's all I could taste. Oh well love and learn !"}
{"text":"Pub Frato has a great Special on Tuesday.  It's called \"Taco Tuesday\" and they are just $2 each. Been there a few times ahead wanted to go tonight.  But there is just one obstacle,  a recent surgery and cast. Not me mind you, but my wife. So what can we do?  Placed a call yesterday and asked for a favor. Could I do take out on \"Taco Tuesday\"? Not only did they say  \"of course!\",  they said the Tuesday bar staff would be made aware I would be in.    Here it is, Tuesday evening and I get to the bar and state my name.  Behind the bar, Nancy (hope I got her name correct) said she is all set! Pulled up my wife's choices and added mine and placed our order. She asked me if I wanted anything while I waited and I asked her to surprise me with a draft. While waiting, saw an old friend and his wife at the bar.  Spent a few minutes and my order arrived.   So before I knew it, saw friends;  treated a new draft (which I forgot the name); got my order; and, WS on my way home.   The purpose of this review was to give a big shout out to the management and staff of Pub Frato. They very easily could have said they could not help out. No, they went the other way and WANTED to help us out.  This is what sets apart a good establishment from a GREAT one! No matter where you live, plan a trip out East my way, and make Pub Frato a MUST visit spot!!"}
{"text":"I should put 4 stars and give you 5 stars when you bring back the smoked meatloaf   In all seriousness. Amazing food. Awesome place. Fairly priced.  But that Meatloaf was to die for.   The pierogis are always a great pick for an app as well.   5 Stars all day"}
{"text":"Food is good but not good enough for the prices they charge I could have better food and bigger portions at  other places"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. I love the interior and the bar seating. The staff is super attentive and friendly. However, the food is just average. I tried many of the appetizers and small plates. The only item that really stood out was the pretzel. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and accompanied by a tasty dipping sauce. Maybe this will my go to place for snacks and beer!"}
{"text":"Good food and service. Their tacos and burgers are delicious. I would say their food is gourmet bar food. Always like coming here! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Still love you.  Beet & Blue salad with a slab of salmon is my favorite and pretty much guilt free!"}
