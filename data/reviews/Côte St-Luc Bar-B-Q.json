{"text":"If you like rotisserie chicken, then you will absolutely love this place.  

I have eaten rotisserie chicken everywhere, and this is the absolute best place on the face of this planet.

Amazing fries, amazing chicken, amazing poutine.  

Why this place doesnt have a line up from opening hour til close blows my mind.

I must go here every time I am in town."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The decor is brown and tired, the waitresses are elderly, but it's just part of the charm.  I hope they never change.  The chicken is the best Montreal has to offer, and the fries are sweet, soft and dark... it's hard not to finish them!  The BBQ sauce is good, the coleslaw is authentic fermented coleslaw, not that garbage cabbage salad from St-Hubert, and the hamburger bun is sad, so sad, but it wouldn't be the traditional Quebec BBQ chicken experience without it.

It's the family's favorite place for get-togethers."}
{"text":"This is my favorite BBQ chicken place.  I love their chunky chicken vegetable soup. It's delish. I also keep coming back for the juicy BBQ chicken with amazing BBQ dipping sauce. Love the garlicky coleslaw (hate the creamy \"mayonazie\" stuff you get ever where else). And their fries .... Yummy! Price is good to - you won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Amazing food + affordable (great for when you're ordering for many individuals).
Sauce is superb.
Always a dependable choice when you need a good meal...fast."}
{"text":"This place isn't much to look at. Comes across like a 3rd rate Swiss Chalet.

But the food is absolutely delicious. We had the chicken and rib combo with fries. The portions were huge and I ate everything on my plate. They bring the coleslaw out first before the food so you actually have something to nible on beforehand. The best thing is that the food tastes real - like it's made right there from real ingredients, not some large food factory like Swiss Chalet. 

Would love to eat here again and takeout looks like a good option too."}
{"text":"Best BBQ chicken in town. Cheap and really quick. 
I don't know how they do it, but I've never had as good rotisserie chicken anywhere, anytime.
The fries - one of the best in the city. Golden brown. Amazing with ketchup or with their amazing sauce or even in a poutine. (I'm getting hungry just thinking about it)

Want a quick and awesome meal, go there!"}
{"text":"Don't ever deliver food here. I ordered for myself only but it took more than an hour. It was just a dinner.. not like a family meal. Never ordering here again..."}
{"text":"Disappointing, chicken somewhat dry, unattractive surroundings.  Tried the Decarie location years ago and loved it."}
{"text":"I live very close to this place. One night I decided to drop by for some take out.

The chicken was very salty, and I was surprized that coleslaw was extra with their meals. The fries were quite good. The sauce (like most of these places) was obviously made from a powder and was very salty also. I do not understand why these places serve those toasted hamburger buns with the meal...I know that its not a 5 star restaurant...but a toasted white hamburger bun...how 1958.

The couple that were ordering after me asked the server if the chicken was well done. The server responded that the chicken was very well cooked. The couple that inquired was from the West Indies. I know that people from the islands like their meet very well done...When I brought my chicken home I thought about the couple, because the chicken was very pink inside. I do not mind my chicken done this way...but I imagine the West Indian couple was disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was not great. Mac n cheese tasted like kd lol. Poutine was fine same with the chicken plate. Service abt akward to be honest..n the dirty glass what a topping on the cake lol.. ps this place is filled with old people and babies."}
{"text":"I love the new renovations,great meal as always,service was super,the best chicken place in town"}
{"text":"I agree with the first two reviews on this restaurant.  The rotisserie chicken falls off the bone and is jam packed with flavor on the outside and juicy in the inside.  The fries although more on the soft side are delicious.  The atmosphere is classic diner style but must say the service differentiates them.  Our waitress Karina had to be one of the friendliest people I've met, which added to the whole feeling of ease about the place allowing you to that much deeply enjoy the rich flavor of your chicken dinner."}
{"text":"I usually order the family chicken pack and it's good, they give a good serving of fries and gravy. They tend to forget the sour cream when ordering baked potatoes and unfortunately their chicken wrap is really gross and soggy (ate half of it and gave up)"}
{"text":"My delivery of quarter chicken leg and two leg meals came with a generous side of fries, some gravy, and an added grilled vegetables order. Overall nothing stood out, it reminded me of Swiss Chalet, and nothing made me think to remember the place for future visits or orders. The quality was as expected for the price point."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a feast of bbq chicken and some unhealthy poutine.  I got both but the taste and quality was a bit lacking.  The 1/2 chicken was nicely cooked but a bit dry.  The cole slaw was the hit of the night.  The bun however was terrible.  Dry and tasteless.  The sauce was terrible.  Like a no-name gravy out of the the Bulk Store.  The poutine was okay.  A generous portion of cheese curds but unfortunately they used their bland sauce and the fries were soggy and tasteless.
Not great."}
{"text":"Almost as good as Chalet BBQ.
Great takeout but delivery tends to take forever.
Restaurant is pleasant, clean and waitresses have been there forever and know everything about the menu.
They aren't reinventing the wheel so don't search the menu for anything new or innovative but they make a mean quarter leg dinner."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for chicken. Make sure you scour around for 2 for 1 coupon for the quarter breast meal. They always seem to be in those envelopes or int he paper. The Quarter Breast  Dinner, includes the chicken (of course) and a choice of  fries, baked potato, mashed, chicken soup, coleslaw or Tomato juice (can't figure that one out). I usually take fries or baked potato and soup. The service here is great, the staff is nice and the place is super clean."}
{"text":"My personal favourite for BBQ chicken, fries and slaw.
I've been here on several occasions and it's good every time! Always fresh and piping hot. Their coleslaw is delicious and tangy and Thursday/Friday nights the place is busy. The service is very quick and efficient and in my opinion, Cote-St-Luc's chicken is crispier, less salty and better tasting to me than St-Hubert. The sauce, which I always get two of, is way better as well. 
I always order the half chicken dinner with fries and coleslaw and practically always do takeout since they are conveniently located just down the street from my dad's place.
Delicious and would definitely recommend if you're craving the best chicken in town!
Take it from a local."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the chicken
Enjoyed the sauce 
even the backed potato was tasty (with a little sauce on it!)"}
{"text":"Best BBQ/Rotisserie chicken on the West Island!"}
{"text":"What a DUMP!

I went here after someone's funeral on a sunday afternoon last year, but after we ordered from there this past weekend, I thought it would be a good idea to tell you guys what I think of this place...

IT SUCKS BIG TIME.

The food is VERY BELOW PAR.

The actual resto. is really old looking, old waitresses (when their this old they are called WAITRESS), old booths, old decor, old smelling...

The chicken is probably as old as the rest of it, dry, UNDER COOKED (!?!), slimy.
Their fries were soggy and warmish...
Our waitress was RUDE and CARELESS and LAZY.

The delivery was not much better other than the ambiance was SO MUCH BETTER (home).

So many better places for chicken.

This is ANOTHER PLACE THAT SHOULD GET A VISIT FROM GORDON RAMSEY TO BE FEATURED ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARE!

Shut it DOWN!!!!!

Visited June 2013"}
{"text":"tres bon wow"}
{"text":"The sides are bad, I had a boring baked potato, a bad salad, but the baby back ribs were awesome, and that's why I went to this place, for some good baby back ribs.  

The waitress was kind. The place looks a little bit cheap, not a place to bring a new girlfriend. But I will definitely come back, gotta try that chicken next time."}
{"text":"The place has been renovated.... but the tables are too close together. The only semblance of privacy during the meal are the booths against the wall. If you are just two people...you will be seated at a table for 4...and will then become inadvertent  dining companions with 2 other diners.   On our visit.... at 5:30 PM...the chicken was dry...as if it had been prepared hours in advance...and then sat around waiting for us. The sauce was waaay thinner than it used to be. This could be from not stirring the sauce before ladling it ...and it is thicker lower in the pot. The fries were crispy and quite good. If they could perhaps eliminate the 8 additional seats in the dining room...by removing some tables...that would be a very good idea. I liked the restaurant better before the fire. The service is still friendly and prompt though."}
{"text":"After being on my Yelp bookmark list for some time, I finally managed to visit this place with some coworkers recently for a Friday lunch.

I won't go into great detail on my visit but basically the chicken offered here is very good. Moist and tender with an abundance of sauce to use. I took a side salad with french dressing and it was very good as well.

The service was quick and efficient, albeit a bit robotic.

The price tag was about right for what you paid for.

I'd definitely come again and I recommend for those who have gotten sick of visiting St-Hubert as the quality of the meal is a notch higher than what you'd get there."}
{"text":"Ok.  Let's get it out there.  This is not fine dining.  Not even close.  The prices have also gotten a bit out of hand overall.  The good thing is that you always can find coupons for deals.  Having said that the chicken is always phenomenal and if you don't like their fries because they're greasy as a reviewer pointed out the you just don't get it.  They're awesome!  The sauce is pretty much legalized crack as it is that yummy.  The service is nothing to write home about but if you and just a really tasty meal in a diner like ambience this is true place. The reviewer below who pointed out the salad, ribs, etc obviously didn't know that this is a chicken joint, the rest is just add ons to make it appear they have a diversified menu!"}
{"text":"Nice place, tasty chicken, cold beer. I was super hungry and this place was exactly what I was looking for. I used the yelp iPhone app to find it. And a really great find it was.

Nice clean atmosphere. Not fancy, but not a dive either. Hockey game on the big TV. 

I ordered the half chicken with fries and slaw. Nice big portions (see pic).

The chicken was done in the rotisserie style and was one the best I've had.  Perfectly golden brown and crisp on the outside and super juicy on the inside.

I definitely did not lose any weight on my trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Rotisserie chicken as good as it gets. We went in the take out entry door, which was a bit sketchy, and the inside decor is straight out of the greasy spoon '50s, but that is meant to invite you not deter you.

Ordered the half chicken so I wouldn't have to choose between white and dark (ha). The waitress was super friendly and attentive. We enjoyed our meal. I had coconut cream pie for dessert, the piece was small but just the size for after a huge meal. It was very good value for money. We will certainly go back again."}
{"text":"In the mood for good BBQ chicken, you have come to the right place. Portion size are just enough to stuff you. I usually skip dessert for there is no more room. (but they are good so I have heard) great place for a large groupe of friends after a game."}
{"text":"What can I say, they do chicken good! I've seen some negative reviews but I'm a big fan of managed expectations. This is not fancy, it's not renovated, it's not 5 star service. However,  it's good service and really good food.  I really think this place delivers on giving you what you pay for. The chicken is hands down the best in the city, always perfectly cooked. The chicken soup is phenomenal....and you can't beat the price. You get a great delicious meal for a pretty small amount of $$ considering what you get.  And the fries are soooooooo good!"}
{"text":"It doesn't get much better than this. Perfect rotisserie chicken with great fries, one of the best parts of the meal is the hamburger bun given to dip in the sauce. This is serious comfort food, nice and greasy, and guaranteed to make you feel better, this is often called Jewish penicillin, as Montreal rotisserie chicken started in the Jewish community. You won't find anywhere that makes better, it's not as famous as the smoked meat, but it might just be better."}
{"text":"First time here for my Mom's 92nd Birthday. Great food great service and everything fresh."}
{"text":"Good chicken!  Good French fries!  Order to takeout as the waitress serving stinks!  And I have to go for dinner early as a turtle moves faster!  Michael Elman"}
{"text":"I'm a chicken fiend and this is in my top 3 favorite chicken places in North America!! Been coming here for over 10 years every time I'm in Montreal and the chicken is always consistently delicious! It just melts in your mouth...yummy!!! Run don't walk here if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I wen't  there once with my Pal and his Girlfriend at the time. We were really hungry and didn't want to pay a big tab. Now «Chicken&Rib places» - Not to name the other competitor - are kind of expensive when you order and for a rib fan, the portion are kind off tiny. But not when you eat AT Cote-Saint-Luc BBQ. GOD. I felt i could handle the Rib and Chicken breast with a barrel of Onion Ring to share with the others. Not a good Idea, the portion were enormous and filling. Pretty good food, plain service and OK speed and Greasy like Hell!"}
{"text":"This is not a fancy restaurant it's a good old fashioned no frills BBQ chicken joint ! I pass by it all the time and the location itself always looks clean and well maintained. However, on my end I've only ever had delivery as opposed to eating there in person. While I did notice that even though they are closeby the delivery time tends to be longer than that of other restaurants but still within reason. That being said they always get the order right and the chicken is always juicy/tasty and well prepared! I usually order their club sandwich which comes with a great pickle, a generous serving of perfectly cooked/salted fries and really good cole slaw. The other nice thing is they include a serving of gravy on the side which is the cherry on the Sunday because who doesn't love gravy ?? I've also tried their hot chicken sandwich which smartly provides gravy and peas on the side to pour them yourself to make sure the dish doesn't get too soggy during delivery. I was also pleasantly surprised when I tried one of their desserts (apple pie cheesecake) , it was sooooo soooo good ! One last point worth mentioning is pricing -the prices are very good especially considering the generous portions and yummy food ! I will definitely eat from here again , cote saint luc BBQ chicken poutine .... I'm coming for you next ! Lol"}
{"text":"I honestly do not know how this place has a almost 5 star rating! I live in the US & apparently 5 stars or even 3 stars means a much different thing then here in Montreal!!! 

Where do I begin... First, the food cost us $63.00 after all was said & done. That was for 3 of us...one being a child. Ridiculous amount of money for what we got! 

Baby back ribs...full set ...was more like mini, over cooked, half rack at most. They were absolutely disgusting. 

The roll that comes with the ribs was a top if a hamburger bun. Are you kidding me? You couldn't spare the whole bun....and not to mention...nice \"roll\". Not what we were expecting...that's for sure!

Chicken wings were overly breaded & sweet...again, absolutely disgusting.

Caesar salad...I've had better salads at McDonalds. Ok, where do I begin once again. Fake bacon bits??? Really??? To my knowledge, Caesar salad does not have bacon bits. Never mind fake ones! Hello?!?! This \"Caesar salad\" was more like a pile of romaine lettuce with fake bacon bits, croutons & who even knows what kind of dressing it was...but it sure wasn't Caesar! 

French fris...soaked and I mean, soaked in OLD oil . WOW...

Food took over a hour to get here...$63 dollars later & we're all still hungry ...don't waste your time with this place or your money. 

Absolutely, without a doubt, BEYOND disgusting. Worst food I have ever ever EVER had in my LIFE. 

Thanks for reading & happy eating :):)"}
{"text":"Amazing deserts, good chicken.. I like the place. Only thing... don't order online. They charge a delivery fee if you do (not matter what the amount).  Call instead..."}
{"text":"Rude rude customer service!!!!  When I called everyone had attitude and put me on hold for long periods of time just to say I'm sorry one hour wait time complete ridiculousness will never call again!!!"}
{"text":"Why does the line cook who handles the foodnot use gloves!?!? Is this not illegal?

For delivery, wait times are ridiculous - even in winter, 1 HOUR to receive food that is a 10min drive away, and arrives cold. NOT WORTH IT."}
{"text":"The Second best BBQ chicken in town still deserves a 5 star rating in my books. Although I'm a bigger fan of Chalet BBQ and still a huge fan of Cote-St-Luc BBQ as well. This place has been here since the early 50's and it still packs them in. Like I mentioned in my review of Chalet BBQ, I'm sure they have a menu and I'm sure they have plenty of great things on it but who needs it, just order the double leg dinner with fries and coleslaw and you're good to go"}
