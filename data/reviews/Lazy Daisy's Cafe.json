{"text":"Great local cafe with delicious eats & treats. Always in for a London Fog and the hard-not-to-get Grandma's Butter Tarts."}
{"text":"Cozy cafe and very friendly staffs. waitress(?) helped me to order for my quick lunch with daughter. it was ok food with high end restaurant portion."}
{"text":"Nothing better than a cup of java after a long day of helping clients in the area find their dream homes. Very lofty design & great staff."}
{"text":"Today, I went with a huge group for brunch & I really liked the vibe of this place. There was action everywhere! Kids playing in the corner in a small play area, extended families having breakfast, people sitting in chairs having coffee and reading the paper. It had a steady flow of people the entire time that we were there.   They have everything listed on the board and you order it and pay for it at the cash. Once it's ready, they bring it to you. There are gluten free options which is still pretty rare in Toronto. They had all sorts of breakfast sandwiches, I had the avocado and cheese on a biscuit. It was filling and delicious.   My friends who go there on a regular basis due to the kid friendly atmosphere, say that Sunday is super busy and that they has to come early. It was busy and loud with all of the action. If you are hungover, this is not the place for you BUT if you have friends with kids and they want to join you for brunch, this is the place.   **Always check in on Yelp before ordering! They have a free coffee with your check in. I was sipping on my yummy latte when I checked in and totally missed out. :D ***"}
{"text":"It's about time my neighborhood got a cafe that compares to the cool Leslieville Cafes that so many flock to.   This place has a great menu that includes cornbread goat cheese Whoopie Pies! The Lattes are amazing and it's kid friendly!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great place to grab a delicious sandwich and soup without spending a fortune!! My favourite is the Farmers Club!"}
{"text":"As I'm currently on mat leave, in the east end, I'm making it my personal mission to try as many new caf√©s and have been ordering a single shot latte at each place.  Last week bought Latte to go, after purchasing a mobile at the toy store next door. At $4.70 this is one of the most expensive ones around! Mind you, it is also bigger than most, but a bit too big for my own personal liking.   The cafe was full, as we were there right around 12:30, but we weren't able to stay anyways, as the bebe was fussing. Seemed like a cute place, but won't make a special trip out."}
{"text":"I want to love lazy daisy. There coffee is good, their food is good. But I find the food portions to be too small. The \"big bean burrito\" is not big. In fact it feel more like an appetizer than a big burrito. It's tasty. But I'm still hungry. Also I wish they would scramble eggs for their breakfast sandwiches.  But the atmosphere is great. And everyone is always very nice!"}
{"text":"I love this place and their coffee.  Plus they are mom/baby welcoming. Good vibes all around."}
{"text":"This has been my go-to cafe since moving to Little India almost 2 years ago. Love the vibe, there are no holier-than-thou espresso-wieding baristas like a lot of the more well-known places. The staff members are awesome! So friendly, (almost) always smiling. They seem to have a LOT to do, so I always try to cut them some slack. This isn't just a coffee shop. There's a full food menu, and even craft beers for sale. Whenever I'm in there the staff are constantly on the move and doing a good job.  I've found it's a good place to get some work done and catch up on emails. The coffee is great, and the food is a-mazing! Fresh, unique, delicious. Sunday brunch is always a hit (and is usually crazy busy). Try the Son-of-a-Rise and thank me later  Food is a bit pricey, but that's what ya get for farm fresh, free run, organic-type stuff. I'm already looking forward to stopping in tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I've been saying for a few years now, that this corner just needs a 'Starbucks' to turn it around and clean it up a little...don't get me wrong, I love Little Indian, but the venues on this corner usually leave much to be desired.  Enter Lazy Daisy's Cafe, and wow!  First of all, kudos to the owners for taking a chance and taking the first of what I hope will be many steps toward improving business in this community.  Secondly, the service and food were fantastic.  I stopped by this morning and had a mocha and toast with my two fav spreads ('pb&n' as I like to call it - peanut butter & nutella) and it did not disappoint.  I expected the service to be great as I've been hearing nothing but great things from folks in the hood, but what impressed me too, was watching as Dawn took the time to chat with all her patrons...and by patrons, I'm talking all walks of life - young, old, professionals, parents with children/infants etc.  Reading her fb page, you get a sense of how much personal passion has been put into this biz, and being there in person proves that's not just a bunch of publicity.  I returned in the afternoon with a friend and we feasted on the salted caramel brownie...deeelish!  I hear they do breakfast on weekends and 'cortados'...I think I'll be filling my coffee card pretty quick!"}
{"text":"Lazy Daisy's is such a welcome addition to the neighbourhood. I'd love it just because it's the only cafe within a ten minute walk of my house and they serve great coffee (Te Aro - locally roasted and delish). But to my absolute delight it gets even better than that!   They offer a wide and interesting (spiced cheese and apple? I can't wait!) array of sandwiches, breakfasts, soups, and baked goods, all of which are made with local ingredients (there's even a cute little map posted of all the different farms they buy from). Food seems reasonably priced, with sandwiches ranging from 4-8 dollars and the chili (the most expensive thing listed) topping out just shy of 9. They even have some gluten-free baked goods (today I sampled the peach and oat mini tart - mmm) as well as a gluten-free bread option for their sandwiches. Love.  Add to that the comfortable space - it's rustic meets urban chic, with worn hardwood floors and vintage wooden boxes as shelves alongside sleek white dining chairs and leather armchairs. And the free, no hassle wifi. And the fact that it seems like they really want to be a community cafe (there's a little kids corner and enough space that I can't imagine feeling like you're 'in the way' if you linger over a book) and we have a definite winner.   I am so sold. I may never spend a homework day at home ever again. Ever.   Best of luck, Lazy Daisy's! I'm really happy to see you in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"food was good. very laid back environment, cozy but noisy, with many many many kids running around. find your own table and line up to order with the cashier. when the coffee is ready, you will be called to pick it up but the food plates are brought to your table. open kitchen, so you might notice some cooking fume."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since the day it opened and I can't believe I haven't written a review! Sorry LD! I love it here - especially now that I have a toddler. It is very family friendly - which might turn some of you off - but if you do have kids it's amazing. I can eat and drink a coffee (hot) while my son plays with trains. Service is always lovely - especially Giovanni who never forgets a face or a name. Ingredients are always fresh & local. I love all of their sandwiches and my son loves the bean salad that comes with them - win win!  Even without kids, it's great sitting in the sunny front with a book or some work and feeling a part of the neighborhood (which I moved out of three years ago but I still come weekly)"}
{"text":"great food, great coffee. They also just started doing trivia and games nights. So happy to have such a cool place in my neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Delicious homemade food! Friendly, competent staff. Congenial ambience. Super value. All in all a winner. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was surprizes to see so many 4 stars for this place and I fail to see why. I'm not giving a 1 star because I don't want to be an a#@$. Came in a weekday morning for brunch. No brunches on weekdays! We were told to pick from a breakfast menu and when receiving our order, we were given a plate with a sandwich made of 2 pieces of toast and unseasoned egg with avocato and tomato. On the side, the fruit was a slice of orange and a sliver of melon. Come on! 2 plates and 2 lattes cost 40 bucks! Sorry but if the server wasn't so nice I would told them off. This place is a rip-off. To AVOID!"}
{"text":"Echo the other poster's thoughts on the chili. Not only that, for a dish that listed beef as the first or second ingredient, there was none. Also avoid weekday lunchtime unless you enjoy having lunch in a daycare.  But I am more than willing to try them again due to the lovely pastries and the smiles. They have great potential."}
{"text":"i'm not a coffee drinker, so i always feel like a bit of a fraud when talking about cafes... anyway, i went with a friend who had a latte and quite liked it. i had a tea--it was okay. i tried one of their scones (can't remember the flavour) and it was so-so. maybe would have been better if it had been warmed up a bit. they have a huge, really delicious-looking menu with all kinds of great breakfast-y sandwiches & dishes--i look forward to going again and trying it out."}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood and really want to like this place.  We've been there twice and experienced very poor customer service both times.  The food is good but not good enough to make up for the lack of customer service.  The first time we went the person at the cash told me \"it was a pain\" for her to make change from my $20.  The second time we went I was served the blackest, most burned quiche I've ever seen and told by the waitress that they knew it was burned but wanted to see if I would eat it anyways.  Seriously, that is so rude and almost mind numbingly bad service.  I was given a $10 coupon to make up for the quiche which I spent right away on cookies because I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'm a student and I can't seem to work at home so I enjoy travelling to cafes to work for the day. I arrived around 11am and ordered an almond milk cappuccino. One of the best I've had, so smooth and velvety. Their prices are in the midrange. I've definitely paid more for coffee. They didn't mind me sitting all day which is nice some restaurants try to rush you out. A couple hours later I ordered lunch. I got the breakfast burrito. This usually comes with chorizo but I am a vegetarian so they happily substituted portobello mushrooms for the sausage. I highly recommend this menu item. They grill it and serve it with a couple pieces of fruit and a side of hot sauce. Delicious. Overall a good experience. The only two downsides for me was the screaming children (although to be fair they do warn you it is a child friendly environment) and the cold air that blows through the vents all day. Other than that friendly staff, cute atmosphere, delicious food and coffee, great for students."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a coffee with the kids who love the train table.  Had a carrot soup that was great, chili only so-so. All baked goods to date have been really yummy. Expensive compared to Coffee Time and New Town, but really, what the heck is there to compare?  Kudos to the owner for stealing my idea! (I kept fantasizing about opening something here because the hood has changed so much). Glad she's done it so well...hope this will be the start of \"Leslieville north\" (now if the Beaches could only open a few NON wing and nacho type restaurants...)"}
{"text":"Coffee is great. Service is typical of any coffee shop - mediocre. Nobody ever says \"how are you?\" these days. Though it is set up like a restaurant, you order your food at the counter, pickup your coffee and they deliver the rest. The menu consists largely of buttermilk biscuits (too sweet for me) layered with different items. The veggie one was reasonable but not particularly tasty. Quite greasy.  Worthy for a visit if you are a local and want a quick bite to eat. The place is cute and comfy."}
{"text":"Disappointing coffee and service ever!! It was super busy saturday afternoon. I lined up and waited 5min and order my coffee extra ice and long shot as usual. But even 10min later my iced coffee didnt ready so I asked the lady ... my iced latte coming.   She looked forgot my order.  But she didnt say sorry and told me it will be ready after another customer's drink.   But I knew that the another customer was lined up way behind of me so it was very annoying and disappointing.  Anyways she made my coffee in a very sloppy way..  And she almost threw the lid of cup and went away.  I am regulr here almost 1 year but Never seen this rude before so embarassed. But it was okay cause it was busy and people can make a mistake I do understand that but the problem was coffee taste....  It was disappointing. No extra ice or no longshot. It was almost milk color.  I used to recommend people this place but I am not sure from now.  They are always super busy most weekend lunch time  So dont expect good service or coffee. Sometimes I feel like this place is over hyped.   Disappointing today!!"}
{"text":"This is a good local spot for coffee, tea and sandwiches if you need some sustenance. I am not sure why there are so many comments about how the food isn't mind blowing. I had a BLT which is pretty standard fare if you are going out for brunch. The sandwich was generously proportioned and came on multi-grain bread.  My friend had the big breakfast which reminded him of an English breakfast. Again generous proportion. The coffee that they had is Pilot coffee.  The seating is spaced out so that you don't feel like you are intruding on your neighbour's conversation.  Families with children do frequent this spot which is nice. The servers were remarkably cheery and amiable. I didn't feel like I had just been parachuted into hipsterville or the land of toddlers.    Would certainly make a return trip."}
{"text":"This comfy caf√© is so far east! It takes us an hour to get there by transit. However, I've been three times in the past month because they have such great events, great food, and great atmosphere. There's a Trivia Night every second Wednesday, a Family Happy Hour every Saturday from 6-8pm (free apple juice and milk for kids), and Open Mic Nights, but it's the monthly Smashmouth Spoken Word Night that is so addictive. If you're a word person, it's a chill Saturday night! You can sign up to share some of your own work or just sit back and relax, and they have two featured artists, one musical and one lyrical.  The menu is a bit expensive, but it boasts local, organic, farm-to-table ingredients, which are fresher than fresh. I'm such a sucker for that! I always get the Harvest Salad (avocados, corn, beans, sunflower seeds, grated carrot, tomatoes, vinaigrette dressing, mixed greens, SO delicious!) I've also tried the grilled cheese, which is tasty and reasonably priced (about $5). People in my groups have tried and enjoyed the chili and the naan pizzas. They have a full line up of coffees and teas, but those especially worth noting are the caramel and chai lattes, so smooth! Their desserts include healthier options, such as gluten free peanut butter cookies and black bean brownies, but the blueberry cheesecake is delish. Oh, also, they're licensed.  If you need any more convincing to check this place out, the owner and staff are all super friendly! Great customer service, very accommodating of large groups. The place itself is open and airy with high ceilings, and I can imagine it would be filled with light in the mornings. When they turn the lights down for spoken word, it gets so cozy! There is a terribly long commute, yet despite this, we still keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been a number of times since opening day, and the quality of the experience remains consistently high. The food, locally sourced and carefully prepared, is delicious, and Dawn, the owner, is always friendly and accommodating. A five-star cafe, if there ever was one."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot. BF and I came by for a quick breakfast and my was it great. The pancakes were fat and fluffy and worked well with the banana and chocolate chips we added. The \"Hi' rise\" sandwich was even better. The bacon was lean and crispy and the biscuit the sandwich is served on was amazing. They absolutely nailed it."}
{"text":"Wonderful little cafe with excellent breakfast and brunch options."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is incredible. I haven't had a disappointing item. Ordered delivery a few times and was happy so I decided to go in with my toddler, which is generally always a nightmare. But there was a toddler table and a lot of parents with little kids which totally put us both at ease. It was so nice not having the only kid in a restaurant.  They were super busy but made time to change my order and add on a few more treats. Coffee was delish, perfect. I didn't see only white women either, it was actually a pretty diverse flow of customers from moms with kids, older retirees, young solo hipsters, and all of multiple various ethnicities. Everyone can appreciate an incredible brekky sammy, delectable scones, and fragrant coffee. :)"}
{"text":"I came here as part of the Indie Coffee Passport 2012 (ICP) I was looking forward to this visit as the place looked nice. Unfortunately I had not read the poor service experience someone else had also encountered beforehand. So lets get the cappuccino review out of the way first.  Espresso: Medium Crema': decent Milk: OK Latte Art: OK (on the first drink 2nd drink was just piled in)  2.5 Stars The cappuccino is OK and the setup is nice.  The service is a show stopper for me here. Maybe it was my grungy look that put them off, but this is not the way to treat a customer. I asked whether I can get my drink in a cup for here and take it outside for a smoke. Flat out no and as the cashier said I can give it to you in to go cup. Never mind I asked it for here and waited for my drink. The barista started to make my drink and used a disposable cup I asked here my cappuccino is for here and without looking up she made my drink, the latte art looked OK on that drink. I asked her I want my drink for here and she just plopped it a ceramic cup. I asked her again can you make it again for me and she started to give me a dirty look like I had committed treason and sighed.  The next drink was made without an effort and the milk was just dumped in the mug, and just put the drink on the counter and walked away. Hmm very poor attitude here but what do they expect characters out of Disney movies! or clients that should belt out songs! I will not be back. I wanted to give them the whole customer is always right speech but alas it would be lost here as I am not their customer and I am sure there are plenty of places that will take my money.  1.5 star if I factor in the poor service."}
{"text":"Honestly I would throw myself into the sun for another Lazy Daisy's quiche. Service is always friendly-- and see if you can sneak in and get a ticket for one of their lovely wine and cheese events!"}
{"text":"I didn't find the service here too great. The table we sat at had remnants of the previous diner's meal. No one bothered to come clean it off so it became self-service. I don't expect to walk into a place and feel like I'm at the Gap and get a \"Hi, there! Welcome to Lazy Daisy's! How can I be of assistance?!\" but a little acknowledgment would be nice.  The food was pretty bland too. My husband ordered a breakfast dish that had bacon. He asked for the dish without it. They said they'd give him more eggs but lies! lies! lies! The pastries looked pretty good though. I think if I return to this place, it'd just be to get a tea and maybe one of those yummy-looking pastries."}
{"text":"Got a black bean brownie and  a carrot cake today. They were absolutely amazing!   Love the interior decor of the cafe, especially the photos on the wall."}
{"text":"I had the veggie rise, hubby had club sandwich, daughter had breakfast burrito and also had sweet potato soup. Everything was delish and fresh."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars inching toward 4.  I came back because of great customer service. The owner, Dawn, sent me an email saying she would like to treat me to another coffee and treat because of the experience I had the last time I came. Wow. A completely unexpected thing that now I can let everyone know how awesome the customer service is.  Overall my review hasn't changed in terms of the coffee and overall feel. I do believe though that this place has found an unbelievably untapped location and is going to do great. Keep it up Lazy Daisy's!  That's it."}
{"text":"I liked this place well enough and could seriously become a regular here, if they addressed a few issues.  There are very few bike parking options and only street parking, so they should look at installing a bike rack (maybe not possible, but as a bike I'd REALLY appreciate it!)  The food is good and made with real ingredients! The coffee was fine (they use pilot beans).   Here is their process:  You go to the counter to order and pay. Next you seat yourself and they will call you when your food and drink are ready.The people that served me my food were all nice. They weren't busy, so the lady actually brought me my sandwich, but the lady who prepared my coffee left it at the bar, which I found odd especially because she never told me and I didn't notice it for some time, which resulted in a lukewarm brew.  The atmosphere is pretty relaxed and it was good for working on my computer. Overall I like it,  but I do have some major issues with some of their prices for baked goods and coffee. Their baked goods are expensive and hover around $3.00 when they should be more around the $2-$2.50 mark. My biggest complaint is that they charge you 2$ for a refill of coffee, which is quite ridiculous, especially if you have just purchased a sandwich, coffee, and baked good. I understand their reasoning for putting a price on refills, but I think the refill should be free if you've purchased a full meal or after a certain price point. Everything else was appropriately priced, in my opinion. Another thing is that their WIFI cuts out occasionally, which is also a bit of a bummer, but not a deal breaker.  If they reevaluated the pricing of their baked goods and their refill policy then I'd come here often and would change my rating to a 4/5 instead of the 3/5. Good food. Good people. Good atmosphere. Some bad pricing decisions/policies."}
{"text":"What a cute, cozy, and delicious caf√©! I stumbled upon this place on Yelp when another restaurant in the area had too large of a line on Good Friday. I am so impressed by this caf√©!   My group was a party of 4 and a baby. You seat yourself, place your order at the counter where you pick up your drinks and food it brought to your table when ready. The space is kid friendly with enough space to place a stroller, although tight, and there is a small play area for kids.   I ordered the country spice sandwich with an egg on sourdough bread. Our group also got a tall stack of banana chocolate chip pancakes that we shared. Everything was delicious!! This caf√© has an award for their sandwiches, and I can believe it. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place thanks to the Indie Coffee Passport. Good spot all in all.   My friend who is a Coffee Nazi -- there, I said it. He just takes his coffee seriously but he enjoyed their Chai Latte. To be honest, so did I. Also I am aware that a coffee purist would snub us for mixing coffee with Chai but sometimes man, you just gotta go with the flow and try new things.    This place is well lit, and spacious. Lots of white on the walls give the locale an airy feeling. Another thing we were pleasantly surprised was their fairly large food menu. Most of which are made in the premises... not bad. Especially when most other places have some dried cookies and the odd sandwiches    We normally go to different and sometimes multiple cafes from weekend to weekend this one stood out due the aforementioned qualities. We also had a very good customer service experience although my friend was overcharged for his sandwich, although once it was brought up, he was given a credit.   Personally I would not come out of my way to come here. Unless a few of us decided to come out, guess the place is just too far away if you are not a local.   Oh, and on ludicrous note, they cafe is very cow-themed! Check the uploaded photo of their tip jar. I find it so adorably silly!"}
{"text":"Pretty good upmarket coffee house where lots of moms and kids hang out and they have breakfast too. Decent prices."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from the Lazy Daisy & finally stopped in. The breakfast sandwiches are amazing & the coffee is perfect. I'm glad we finally have a decent cafe in the area."}
{"text":"This is an adorable place with locally sourced cafe with organic and vegan pastries, sandwich options and delicious beverages. I LOVE the aesthetic - minimal and crisp. It is quite spacious as well. A great place for conversation, study or work! :)"}
{"text":"I rarely give restaurants 5 stars, but this place was on point. Easily my new favourite breakfast spot! I ordered a bunch of items on the menu & everything was delicious.    Pancakes: OMG so fluffy! I haven't had good pancakes like this in a while.   \"Son of a Rise\" brekkie sandwich: I ordered this because it was rated # 1 breakfast sandwich in Toronto. So yummy! I could eat this for breakfast everyday. Fresh ingredients on top of a mouth-watering buttery biscuit.   Curry Ginger Carrot Soup: Amazing! The flavor was on point & served with fresh bread.  They also had a bunch of fresh baked goods that looked really good, but I was too full to try anything else that day. Will definitely be back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim with a friend today and will.definitely go again.  I got a vegetable wrap and chai tea. Super yummy wrap. After eating I grabbed another chai to go and a delicious ginger cookie!  Lots of yummy menu options to choose from as well. The actual cafe has a nice friendly vibe and I noticed a lot of board games on a shelf so looks like you csn enjoy some games with friends there too."}
{"text":"you would enjoy dining experience in Lazy Daisy's Cafe if you get bored with the Chains set menus.  \"The Sun of Rise\" - buttermilk biscuit + melted cheddar cheese + avocado + BLT.  evilly delicious"}
{"text":"Very nice place, we were there at closing time, and instead of rushing us out, the barrista was very nice. We ordered 2 iced mocha coffees, they were really good, I would have ordered another because it was so hot out, but they were closing up. Nice looking place too."}
{"text":"A lovely local cafe with excellent brunch options and delicious coffee (pilot roasters). The food is simple, quality ingredients within a friendly and warm setting. For brunch, I try to get there early before it's too busy on weekends. A note for vegetarians - don't be deterred by the menu -  they are always great about swapping meat with veggie options! Most things can be made veg friendly (as well their veggie breakfast sandwich is delicious!)."}
{"text":"Definitely not the right place if you don't want to be surrounded by kids. The place gets loud and a little chaotic on Saturday mornings when the local families come for brunch.  Food is on the pricy-ish side because everything is organic/free range/locally sourced. If you're looking for big portions, you've come to the wrong place.  That being said, the food is good. It's nothing special or creative, but it's done well. I had the veggie rise and the biscuit was very tasty and buttery. Unfortunately, it doesn't come with any sides. My brunch companion had the burrito and said it was good, yet too small. It came with a side of salad which looked a bit sad (a bit of baby spinach with dressing).  Not sure if I will go back to be honest. I think I might be the wrong customer for this place. I see brunch as a feast that fills me up for most of the day and this place fails to do that. Well, that is unless you're willing to dish out more money and order more than one item to make sure you don't walk out hungry."}
{"text":"Lazy Daisy's serves up Te Aro Coffee as well as delicious sandwiches and baked goods in the Gerrard/Coxwelll area.  I love the space, which has high ceilings and lots of tables.  It's definitely a family-oriented space with a play area in the back for young kids!  I had a cappuccino and salted caramel brownie.  Both were really good, but can't say excellent.  I wish the cappuccino foam was frothier and hence the drink smooth.  The caramel was lost in the brownie, but I did love the salt!    I've had their sandwiches before as well and they were very tasty from what I recall!  A great place to hang-out, grab a bite and chill-out."}
{"text":"This place is a disappointment. The good is awfullllll! Tastes terrible. Everything is just wrongg!"}
{"text":"Average.  Basic breakfast food.  I thought I would be blown away by the food here, but my assumption is that all the other ratings are really based on the atmosphere more than anything.  Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic biscuit sandy. I make my own homemade biscuits (and have eaten a lot both home and away) so I consider myself a biscuit pro, and these are fantastic biscuits.  The place is clearly family/kid friendly. Super strong and tasty coffee. I'll be back. Great spot."}
{"text":"Cute little caf√© located at Main and Gerrard, a nice place to get some breakfast and a coffee. Their breakfast sandwiches are my favourite.  It's generally very busy and pretty noisy, since it's a family-friendly caf√©. There are often a lot of kids around, so if you don't like having kids around, this probably isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"Oh my! What an excellent find on our trip here to TO. Our meals had lots of flavor - I mean lots. Incredibly flakey biscuits. Great coffee; delicious almond croissant. Friendly relaxed staff - and all provided a warm atmosphere with prompt service!! We just met the owner Dawn. She told us the tables come from reclaimed wood at her parents farm...the barn. Natural foods, ethically raised protein - def coming back next time we're in town. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Came in for brunch this Saturday morning and I had a pleasant experience here. The environment is very comfortable and if you had some work to do, you could bring in your laptop for afew hours, given that you don't mind noise. I'm saying this because there is a kids corner where they can play so if you're looking for some quiet, look for another caf√©.   I ordered a chai tea latte ($3.99) and a breakfast burrito which has avocado, monetary Jack cheese, scrambled eggs, and sausage bits (~$9). The price of the food and drinks here is a little expensive for me. But! The chai tea latte was the best I've ever had and the burrito was delicious! When you order at the cash register, they give you a number and you can take a seat. The server will find your number and serve you your food.   If you're in the area, do try it out :) just know its a family style cafe where people bring their kids!"}
{"text":"Comfy comes to mind.. Lot of white women with their babies. So noise, sound can be annoying. Coffee was very good."}
{"text":"If you have kids and want to enjoy a casual lunch or brunch out of the house, go here. There is a great train set that my toddler loves to play with and it's close enough to the tables that I can sit and eat and still keep an eye on him. The food is great - not the cheapest - but that's typical when you get fresh local food. Its a weekend staple for us now."}
{"text":"My friend lives in this area and was over joyed there's a place for coffee in his hood other than a Coffee Time or the coffee machine at the laundromat. The down side seems to be this place closes early during the week.   The crap hours aside, the place is mega cute inside. Very cow-themed. Reasonable prices. $1 for a cookie, which might run you $3 at Starbucks. Even the bathrooms are cute.  Lots of seating. Not sure if they have free wireless which might be the reason there was lots of seating.   I love they keep out a jug of water with some orange slices in it. Amazingly tasty and refreshing. I wish Starbucks/Second Cup would do this. It would make summers a lot more pleasant."}
{"text":"Cute space, and it's great to support a small local shop. However, the coffee they poured me was horrifying. It had clearly been sitting on the burner for far too long. Will never order coffee there again. Blech."}
{"text":"I love this cafe! \"Lazy Daisy's\" is one of those places that you feel comfortable in... Of course the environment helps but also their food and personnel!  They have games for you to play, many electricity plugs on the wall for you to charge your laptop or phone and a very good coffee to go with that.  I'm sold and I also recommend you to go visit them."}
{"text":"Adorable little cafe for a light lunch or snack.  The teas are delicious.  I came here with a friend to catch up and we quite enjoyed ourselves.  Homemade treats and friendly service.  The only real complaint was the group of screaming children hanging out for the first half of our lunch.  Not really the cafe's fault though!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars would be my actual rating. I don't think I need to reiterate what others have said about the amazing food, organic ingredients, and many many children. We've been coming here a lot for the last month and I have a few very specific issues/complaints. 1: I don't understand why they continue to take a name for the order but then never call the name. I'll order a sandwich and a latte, they call out \"Latte\" from the end of the bar; then someone comes wandering around wondering who the sandwich is for. It's more bizarre than anything else. 2: This issue is a first for me: cleanliness. I wouldn't mention it if it wasn't consistent. Maybe every time I've been here, something has seemed less than clean. It's like their dishwasher doesn't do a good job. My cutlery on one occasion definitely had food residue on it. I've noticed that the jars for water at the front warrant close inspection before pouring your drink. And on one occasion, the staff member that brought our food out actually gave us two dirty napkins (you know, like you wiped your fingers on them but never unfolded or crumpled them up?) I'm not a crazy germophobe, it's not something I would normally notice, but it's happened enough times that I thought it was worth mentioning. I still really like the food here though."}
{"text":"Breakfast is yummy! I really enjoyed the biscuit sandwich over the other options. The coffee was ok nothing special. I think our favorite thing is they support local farmers and growers!"}
{"text":"Was so happy to see this business pop up in a neighborhood that has been a bit slow to gentrify.   Checked this place out for the first time on a Sunday. Lazy Daisy's Cafe does a perfect job of balancing \"hip\" with \"family friendly\" with a cool interior (sleek seating, including a communal table at the front of the house, exposed brick) and a kid-friendly play area at the back of the space.  Service was friendly and the food menu, though mainly sandwiches and breakfast fare, was extensive. While true that their pricing may be slightly higher than other businesses in the area, they did not seem unreasonable considering the ingredients are sourced locally (including bread from local artisal bakeries). The breakfast sandwich I had and the breakfast burrito my husband had were both delicious. Te Aro coffee was a nice plus and prepared perfectly (I had an americano)."}
{"text":"This place has the feel of a coffeehouse, but it's more of a restaurant than that. It's a great weekend brunch spot if you're looking for a place you can drop into quickly and easily without having to wait around for half the day. Delicious but no frills.  The breakfast sandwiches here are delicious, as mentioned by another reviewer. The biscuits are so tasty! Everything here is made with simple but organic and locally sourced ingredients. For instance, they have fresh Mennonite bacon. It makes for simple but delicious food.   They also have delicious fresh-squeezed orange juice. Definitely a nice go-to."}
{"text":"Just ok. Nothing amazing. Although, their sandwich looked great. (But never tried one) It has wifi but it didn't work last time. It seems like it's local mom's hot spot, though. Toddlers to teenage kids come with their moms and friends. Nothing is wrong with it. Just don't expect it to be quite. lol If you looking for some place to bring your kids, you will like it. They have little toy train at the back. Super cute!"}
{"text":"Food was nice and fresh. They could benefit by adding some non-pork meat options to their menu. They offer great coffee and expresso items. Freshly squeezed orange juice is a very good option as well. Very kid/ family friendly."}
{"text":"I don't spend a lot of time in this area but I've been working nearby for about half a month now and this has quickly become a morning staple. Delicious coffee, awesome breakfast sandwiches, almost all of which are completely home made, and the friendliest staff I've ever met, even during their super busy morning rush! They even make their own breakfast biscuits. So good."}
{"text":"Local family friendly cafe at Coxwell and Gerrard. It's nice and comfy and you get a nice feel at home sense when at the cafe. It's a nice casual cafe to catch up with friends and family over a cup of coffee and pastry or even to catch up on some work on your laptop as the cafe does supply free WiFi as well. Their food is made with local ingredients that they get from local farmers and suppliers and a lot of their pastries are homemade. If not they are brought in other local bakeries. They also have beer from local breweries like Godspeed Brewery that is open just behind them on Coxwell. Their menu maybe on the pricier side and gets busy around lunch and especially on the weekends (they have brunch from 8:30am-2:30pm on the weekends and a brunch menu) but totally well worth it!"}
{"text":"Went back to Lazy Daisy's after a long time of not going there as I don't recall it being stellar, food-wise.  I went there on a Monday and was surprised to see they had a promo called \"Mama Mondays\", that gives 10% off the whole order.  I had an iced latte, the farmers club sandwich and a caramel chocolate brownie.  The sandwich wasn't a huge portion, which you think would be more for the price but given that their ingredients are naturally raised meats, etc and there was a lot of it, I was okay with the higher price point.  The chicken breast was great and of course the bacon.  The iced latte meets expectations of a local coffee joint.  It's smooth and delicious.  chocolate caramel brownie: omg.  so good. must go back for another.  What I loved though is as a mom, I can eat there and my older child can be entertained and the food there is healthy (just don't get the decadent pastries for them.. save it for yourself!).  The 10% discount on Mondays is also a nice touch.  the food isn't particularly creative but they do a good job of sourcing quality ingredients and it shows.  The portions are also not the largest, so I wouldn't go in if you're starving."}
{"text":"This place is as cute as a button - and the food is pretty good too! I had a couple of cookies and fresh-squeezed juice and it all tasted pretty good.  I'd highly recommend this place to families - there are toys for younger kids to play with and wi-fi for kids working on their homework (saw examples of both categories). The only iffy thing I noticed was that it got really, really hot in here, so I started to feel a bit faint. Maybe it's just the fluctuating temps outside though; it's hard to adjust to the perfect point in spring.  Bathrooms are very clean and roomy too - again, great for families."}
{"text":"This part of Toronto is gentrifying. There is a neat toy store next door and in general the storefronts are better kept.   This place deserves a great neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Great coffee, mediocre service. I went today with a friend, and had ordered an iced coffee. It was written on the blackboard, and I was craving it. The barista made it for me, but was questionable the whole time and said coldly that the drink was off season (pun slightly intended) and so I apologized.  My friend and i then sat for a while and left. There was no acknowledgement, rather the other customers leaving at the same time recieved warm goodbyes.  Maybe because we are teenagers, but i didn't feel good for being treated differently for the way i look, or i am just exaggerating?  Either way fragrant and delightful coffee."}
{"text":"LOUD !!! This is a great place if you too are an entitled parent. I like Flying Pony better"}
{"text":"Upon entering Lazy Daisy's Cafe, I was glad how extremely spacious it was and how it had plenty of seating available. Since this was one of the further cafes I had to trek to, I was glad my efforts were not wasted when I planned to study there. Their windows were big, allowing abundance of sunshine to come pouring through.  After ordering, I immediately realized how children-friendly the cafe was. At the very back of the cafe, they had baby stools available and a range of children books and toys. They even offered products geared towards children for their parents to buy! They successively tapped into a niche market when I noticed the frequency of customers that had brought their young children with them, something I rarely saw in past cafes I'd been to.  Originally, I was planning on trying their Pear Creme Tea because it was something I have never heard of before. But I realized I needed something strong so I could stay awake for my evening class. The dirty chai latte I ordered with a double shot espresso wasn't as sweet as other chai lattes I was used to but, it wasn't bitter where I had to get out of my way to add any sugar. I think it did an effective job on keeping me awake (adding on top of the regular coffee I had the morning of).  Deciding on the spot in which I was planning to create this blog, Tissa the barista, was very nice and helpful in replying to all off the questions I had regarding their menu. Her knowledge went far and beyond as I received way more information than I expected. Before she left her shift, she thanked for my visit and looked forward to my review of this cafe. It was very thoughtful of her and definitely added to my sweet experience at Lazy Daisy's Cafe."}
{"text":"Unbelievable service, coffee was velvety and incredible and the breakfast sandwiches are some of the best in the city. The biscuit one is HUGE.... but it is really really good. Come hungry!"}
{"text":"Loving the ambience..casual and relaxed. A great cafe where the waitresses are friendly and efficient! They have a great variety of food from cookies, sandwiches, breakfast munchies and smoothies. I also love that they serve pilot roasted coffee ... Which are my favorite and just around the neighbourhood.  However, I find the sandwiches a URLs to expensive for the portions served. Quiches are great tasting and the gypsie cookie is definitely an interesting cookie with most mash of ingredients. This place could be packed over the weekend and don't open late."}
{"text":"The best breakfast sandwich I have ever had! The entire time I was eating, I kept saying \"Oh my god...\" because it was so tasty. Having this place near my new apartment is dangerous!  The pancakes are also fantastic. Fresh, simple and delicious. They now serve the pancakes on weekdays as well."}
{"text":"Was in the area and came across this little quaint cafe. Came at around 9:30am on a Sunday and it was already a full house! Luckily we were able to snag a seat by the wall. This cafe is family oriented and kid-friendly (in the back corner there's a play place).  How it works is that you order at the front and then grab a seat. Water is self serve and if you order coffee/drinks, you have to go pick it up the front. Food will be delivered to your table. Service was excellent- quick and friendly.   The food we got: - son of a rise (breakfast sandwich) this was so good, the bread they used was like the Popeyes biscuit, but more sweet. Bacon was also flavourful and delicious.  - chilli (cashier said it was a seasonal item, we thought it was okay...)  - green acre salad. The dressing was amazing, made the salad more light and refreshing. - large fresh brew (free with a check in on Yelp!!!)  - large orange juice (freshhhhh!)   Bill came up to around $35, but it was worth it cause everything tasted fresh, healthy and delicious! Would recommended if you're in the area (the neighbourhood is also very colourful and cool)."}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwich/burger! High rise is a must try! Nice decor and atmosphere. Kind staff."}
{"text":"It's ok but they are overcharging parents. $3 for a juice box?! 3.5 for a kids hot Chocolate? It's sad when you have to push prices this high."}
{"text":"My fav iced lattes (with coconut milk) in the city!  When you're looking for a treat, the veggie hi-rise on their homemade biscuit is amazing. Only downside is they close so early."}
{"text":"Five stars for the great coffee - very important for a cafe two stars for the food two stars for the value ZERO stars for the service  Want to clear your own table so you can sit down? Lazy Daisy's is the place for you. Take your choice of half of the tables in the place - all the empty ones were all covered in other people's dishes when we walked in.  The quality of the food is fine, but the preparation leaves much to be desired. At $15 for the 'Big Breakfast' I expect to be impressed. But my 'over-easy' eggs were hard, my little ramekin of beans was refrigerator cold, and the 'baked' tomato and 'fried' mushroom slices clearly hadn't spent long enough in the microwave.  The toast was actually warm, though.  My advice? Enjoy the good coffee, but don't eat here."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. The coffee is ok, nothing special about it. My go too is The Combine brunch, which consist of pancakes, toast, bacon or sausage, and eggs.  I love meat so The Combine is a good balance of pancake and meat. They ran out of bananas so I got my pancake with blueberries and chocolate chips which I find it made the pancake a bite soggy. I love that they use local ingredients, and it is kid friendly. there isn't anything special about it."}
