{"text":"Fortunately enough to swing by for a soft opening! Great place to grab a snack before or after a movie at MAC. Sampled the chocolate chip waffle bites sprinkled with powdered sugar and a side of syrup.

Can't wait to try the waffles wrapped hot dogs.

Thanks to a buddy posting the opening on fb ...I just happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"What a marvelous concept! Waffles and hot dogs coming together as one! We tried the waffle dog and the sausage in a waffle and really enjoyed them both. The sausage one was particularly good covered in syrup - like having a little bit of breakfast in the afternoon. Next time I plan to try the smores waffle."}
{"text":"Very cool and different place! Waffles and hot dogs or both. I'm not really a hot dog fan but the waffles are amazing! They have a cinnamon flavor to them and you can put any toppings you want on/in it. My favorite is peanut butter and honey. Great price and quick service. Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"First off, I love waffles so I'm up for any place that sells them.  Not so sure about a hotdog in a waffle, but I did go for the waffle sundae which was quite good.  Staff was very friendly and service was quick.  Wish we had one out on the west side."}
