{"text":"Cozy, laid back, atmosphere in the dining room yet still buzzing and lively. Friendly, efficient service. Not a surly staff-member anywhere; none of the cloying, ingratiating types either. Food was simply prepared. Fresh, with an authentic, homemade and traditional ring. Enough of a variation on the themes to avoid cliche territory and provide a fresh interpretation. Offering is geared towards comforting familiarity and for the unpretentious diner - as I like it.  A high recommendation, particularly when you factor in ease of access by subway or car (lots of Green P parking nearby)."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food, nice atmosphere, and the service is usually good. My parent's place is nearby, so we're here fairly often -- I personally like the food and atmosphere more than Terroni's, and the staff are nicer."}
{"text":"The food here is great but the service needs work.   I chose this location for a work meeting. My colleague and I arrived a few minutes early and noticed the person we were meeting hadn't arrived yet. They told us to sit anywhere so we chose the patio and left the name of the person we were meeting.   Within the first few minutes the server came over a few times, gave us water, and asked if we were waiting for another person. We said yes and she said something like \"okay, I tend to think people are waiting for someone when they really aren't and then leave them waiting\". Ok.  After 20 minutes, I texted the person I was waiting for to see if she was close. A moment later she walked out holding her water saying she had been waiting inside for 15 minutes. The hostesses/servers never put together that she might be who we were waiting for? Or ask for her name, which we had given them? She sat down and the server didn't come back for a very, very long time. We actually had to flag her down to get her to take our order. We had been there for almost an hour at this point. I guess she did warn us.  I ordered a salad as my main, and when the food arrived, our guest had the salad I had ordered as her side dish and I had nothing. After several awkward minutes of my colleague and our guest sitting with their food, and me sitting with nothing, another salad came out and they apologized for their mistake.   I would definitely come again as the food was amazing, but the servers need to step it up. Made for an awkward work meeting."}
{"text":"Went here at around 4:30pm and the service was quick since it was quite empty. I ordered the Bufala which is like a caprese salad except the mozzarella and the tomatoes were served separate. The dish tasted great but I wish the presentation was more like a traditional caprese. The portions were small for the $$$"}
{"text":"We went with friends and it was a disaster.   They double charged us for one meal  they gave our friend the wrong type of drink. The steak was blue when I got it instead of medium rare.  When we asked the waiter how long was the dry aged steak aged for and how big was the piece he couldn't tell us.    My wife's pasta had shrimp that was raw.   The steak was clearly not aged as it was tough and stringy.    When I got home I immediately had to run to the bathroom. Never again!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pasta special with sausage, the pasta was swimming in oil, there was no visible sausage and so salty I couldn't eat it. When I asked the waitress she said it's there you just don't see it. Perhaps they should change the name of the special to the Pasta with the Invisible Sausage. On a previous occasion we ordered pizza with chicken, they should of called that Chickadee, it was good but again no chicken. The restaurant  did remake the  pasta for me it and placed a lot of \"something\" on top and said it was sausage, they said they did that so I could see the sausage this time, I really don't know what it was. My husband had the meatballs and a salad, it was tastless. The apple tart with ice cream for dessert was very good, the creme brule  it was bland.  There are so many great restaurants in Toronto, not sure why this one is so busy."}
{"text":"Another place to avoid.  The sound level is deafening. Also, why no curtains? If you sit too close to a sunny window you either melt, or cannot see. An easy fix.  Food is OK and the service friendly. But - forget about talking to your friends.   I am tired of paying good money to go to a restaurant to shout. This restaurant, as so many other in Toronto need sound attenuation, easy to arrange, but...  Toronto is noisy, our residents are already half deaf and the people who run restaurants don't give a damn. Or? - Prove me wrong."}
{"text":"We came here for a friend's birthday. The atmosphere was very intimate and cozy, and very nice decor. I only had the pizza and pasta here but it was delicious. These folks know a thing or two about Italian food! Yum.  I will definitely want to come back and try the other main dishes. Will update this review once I do."}
{"text":"The food, service and atmosphere is always great. The wine list is disappointing. We would eat there more often and I would add at least an extra star if the wine list improves and/or have the option to pay corkage to bring our own wine...and take our wine home if we don't finish."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and always been very pleased. I actually discovered it because I went to Teronni across the street and they didn't carry diet coke, like honestly who doesn't carry diet coke...not to mention no substitutions. needless to say I went across the street and enjoyed an amazing meal  The beef and or bison carpaccio is phenomenal. I had the catch of the day which was salmon. Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Bad service. Horrible service. I don't understand why some businesses don't understand the simple equation of treating a customer with respect and treating their food preparation with respect. Pizza was sloppy."}
{"text":"I'm slowly venturing north of Bloor on a more frequent basis, plus the area of Yonge & St. Clair has seen changes over the past years.  My first time at Capocaccia and I was happy that they had an Italian Aperitivo (happy hour) from 4pm - 7pm Monday to Friday where all food items are under $7,  plus $5 house wines and $5 beer.  It was definitely a great deal and makes my wallet happy.  Service was friendly and attentive as soon as I walked into the restaurant.  My friends were already seated at  the bar since it's always fun and entertaining and we never know  who we'll encounter.  We definitely had a good time chatting up with some regular customers.  Good thing we managed seats at the bar because being a Friday, the place was pretty busy.  The noise level was a little loud for my liking that I had a bit of trouble hearing my friends.  The place had a comfortable and homey feel to it with friendly staff and the manager took time to walk around checking on everyone.   It was definitely very welcoming and nice to see the manager engaging with customers ensuring that everything was good.  I found the place a little crowded as the tables and chairs in the dining area were close to one another making it a little difficult to head to the washroom.  Plus the washroom was tight and I almost got knocked out by the door while washing my hands when another woman was trying to enter. I guess due to configuration it was odd and the stalls were already awkwardly shaped, but they did make good use of the space they have.  They also have a decent size patio, which I'm sure would be very busy in the warmer weather.  Since it was raining that evening is was covered by tarp.  Now to the food:  Free rosemary bread was served with a plate of olive oil.  The bread tasted great alone, but even better with the olive oil. I practically had the whole basket and probably could have had more.  I was carbo loading for my weekend's race, so the more bread the better.  Polpette $6: 3 traditional meatballs served in a bowl of homemade tomato sauce. It was very flavourful with a nice blend of herbs and not salty at all.  The tomato sauce was so delicious I used the bread to dip into the sauce. I can probably eat the sauce by the spoonful like a soup as it was that good.  Crostone $5: two slices of bread served with bufala, ricotta, tomatoes and olives.  It was definitely crusty, but it was indeed fried bread with a nice blend of cheesy goodness topped with a few tomatoes and olives.  Nice presentation and taste was quite nice as well, but just a bit too hard for my liking.  Prosciutto and melon $7:  three slices of cantaloupe wrapped in prosciutto served with a fig also wrapped in prosciutto.  Melon was lovely, not too ripe and it was just sweet and the saltiness of the prosciutto added a nice blend of flavours.  Probably the best cantaloupe and prosciutto I've tasted other than when I was in Tuscany.  Calamari fritti $7: fried calamari served with fresh salsa.  Although it was lightly fried, it tasted a bit chewy and bland to me. But I added the tomato sauce from the polpette which gave it a nice flavour.  Margherita pizza $7: classic thin crusted pizza with bufala, sprig of basil and drizzled with olive oil.  I had two slices as I just love the simplicity and flavours of the margherita pizza, but could probably eat the whole pizza myself as it was pretty good.  When I'm carbo loading, I can generally eat a lot and I blame the running for that.  We also shared the flourless chocolate cake ($8) and it was probably the best flourless cake I had.  The texture was smooth and flavourful and the chocolate just melted in my mouth with every bite.  It was so good that I  wanted to order another one just for myself, but had to refrain because I was quite full at this time. I blame all that bread I ate!  Wish I took photos of the food, but I was too hungry and too busy catching up with friends that I forgot.  My friends thought it was odd since I always take photos of the food, but I'm sure I'll return and will definitely take lots of photos. A definite must try if you're in the area.  Buon appetito!  P.S.  We were also wished a nice farewell and evening by the wait staff and the manager himself with a receiving line on our way out.  A definite nice touch or was it a coincidence they were all by the entrance at that time?"}
{"text":"I went here for a business lunch with a large number of colleagues. The food was good, but the restaurant refuses to split up the bill individually. It added an extra half hour on top of a long wait for our food.  It's 2012 - that kind of lack of efficiency can't cut it anymore.  Definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place to go if your boss is taking you out for lunch and paying. It's overpriced for what it is, but given the area that it's in, the prices are understandable. If you've got money to blow and a $30 lunch is no big deal for you, then by all means - check this place out. The decor is nice, the staff is very friendly, the food is good and fresh but nothing spectacular. The portions are pretty small for the price."}
{"text":"have been here a few times and have always been very pleased. I actually discovered Capocaccia because I went to Teronni(not there anymore) across the street. Teronni doesnt carry Diet coke... I mean honestly.. who doesnt carry Diet Coke.. so that combined with no substitutions took this picky eater across the street.   The beef and/or bison carpaccio is phenomenal. I tend to try their feature dishes... always really good."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian dining, with a nod to Firenze. Highly recommend their salads, carpaccio and pizzas. Ravioli is excellent. Nice for a date."}
{"text":"Folks we have a winner here for pizza. With the authentic Italian pizza scene heating up in Toronto for a few years this place hits the 850 degree mark in my book for the best Italian pizza in Toronto! The dough is cooked just to the right amount of crisp, the sauce doesn't overwhelm with sweet or sour notes, the cheese and other ingredients are spot on.  Now for some background I recall my only exposure to this spot was I had a cappuccino here eons ago and the place was much smaller and they had a dark cozy feel. I made a mental note to visit them but it never came to fruition.  Now they have expanded and the decor has changed to an airy portofino look (blue tiles substituting for the Italian Riviera). The service is decent and their non pizza offerings looked enticing as well. I will be back for the pizza for sure and might even try the tasting or prix fix. 4.5 stars for the pizza."}
{"text":"I am rarely in this neighbourhood.  I received a gift card for this restaurant so it gave me a chance to try it out.    Since we were on our way midtown, I called in my order for one N'duja pizza for pick-up.  I was impressed.  The pizza smelled so good I just went for it as I was in the passenger seat of the car.    The crust was soft yet crisp.  The toppings, although didn't seem like a lot, were the perfect amount.  Each bite was truly delicious.    It was $22 for one pizza.  A bit steep but it's a beautiful space on Yonge St. just south of St. Clair.  They have a special on Sunday nights for a family style dinner.  I would love to try that!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favourite Italian places in Toronto.  I discovered this place when my date told me it was his favourite Italian place.  The restaurant was memorable for all the right reasons.  The date was memorable for all the wrong reasons. They have a great wine list, incredible breads and an awesome range of unique apps, traditional pizzas, pastas and some really well done classic entrees.  One of the to-die-for dishes was actually the fig arugula salad-  Since I tried it at this place I have recreated it many times with ingredients I have sourced from St. Lawrence market- and let me tell you- it is NOT cheap. So for a resto to even have appetizers that are incredibly memorable...well that's a good show.  The environment isn't the best... the streetscape is missing a neighbourhoody feel although I can tell a lot of people here are regulars.  I still would say pasta is best at Terronis Pizza is still best at Libretto.  but like in terms of full-service Italian dining I really enjoy the food and experience at this place.  For starters, entrees, dessert, a bottle of red and espressos the bill was pretty steep (350+??).  I likely wouldn't make this a regular and it is just far enough out of the way that it probably wouldn't become one."}
{"text":"I've been in Toronto for a week and I've eaten here twice. Once for dinner and once for lunch. The fact that I've gone 2 times should say something. The food was great and the service was quick and friendly. Would love to go back"}
{"text":"This spot is quite reliable.  It has a good range of Italian dishes and some OK wines.  It's open until 11 pm, so if you're working late and can't be bothered to cook it's handy to pop in here on the way home."}
{"text":"Service was quick and friendly. Went on Tuesday mid-afternoon with a friend, and it wasn't busy so we had our pick of seats out on the patio, which was lovely. Ordered the mushroom pizza to split, and it arrived within 10 minutes. Tasted great, but was quite oily, which slightly detracted from the flavors present. The toppings were a bit sloppy, and considering the lack of clientele at the restaurant at the time, this was a bit disappointing. Apart from mushrooms, the pizza was topped with spinach and Camembert, I believe. Lovely combination of flavors and the crust wasn't thick, which I appreciated. Would come here again, but would order differently next time."}
{"text":"Very authentic Italian food and flare with much of the staff obviously from Italy.  All the staff had big smiles and we were provided with wonderful service.  The breaded calamari was exceptional and the veal chop was seasoned and grilled to perfection and came with a very tasty side of Sicilian caponata (vegetables).  Also, they have a very nice and reasonably priced wine list.  A real neighbourhood gem.  Overall an exceptional experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I have visited this resto twice and we're liking more it and more everytime. Our last visit we each enjoyed a salad, a main course, drinks and desert - $180 tip included.   My wife said, \"one of the best salads she's had in a long time\" (and fortunate for me she eats a lot of salads) and a perfectly prepared piece of fish with a small smearing of potato puree, rapini and a delicate whole orange pepper.   I had the beet salad and the pistachio crusted Australian rack of lamb with the same plate prep as above - both the salad and lamb we're excellent.   We paired with a two great wine by glass offerings and also had desert.   The only reason this review doesn't get 5 stars - the chef and the sous chef were both using their cell phones texting in the open kitchen... And that's just not hygienic... If I see that next time I'm going to ask to speak with ownership."}
{"text":"I don't give out 5-Star ratings easily, but our experience was truly sublime.   My wife and I stumbled upon this restaurant when wandering in the neighbourhood and was pleased to step inside, and see a really unique, creative, warm, modern and unique decor coupled with a nice menu (which we viewed before we sat down. The restaurant was busy but not full, and there are lots of restaurants with nice decor and a good menu that aren't extraordinary, but we opted to give it a try.   Our friendly, not pretentious waiter greeted us immediately and offered us drinks and walked us through the very creative specials. We learned that the chef is fairly fresh from Italy and makes everything homemade, including all the pasta.   To start  my wife and I shared the most unique and tasty buffalo mozzarella with cherries tomatoes that we had ever tried...we loved it.   I had an italian beer that I had not seen elsewhere and my wife had a glass of Riesling that she thought was excellent.  We decided to share evenly two pasta dishes. I ordered the rich, creamy, and mushroomy, ravioli, and my wife the Gnocchi with buffalo mozzarella  and tomato sauce. The ravioli was so amazing, the sauce so rich with flavour I personally thanked the chef (in my very poor italian); the Gnocchi was actually light and fluffy, with a truly homemade tomato sauce that we both loved.   We had to skip dessert to get home to our kids, but can't wait to return.   Btw, the pricing was very similar to many other similar italian restaurants that don't have the decor, great food or the great service.   I hope our second visit is just as perfect!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, has a good vibe to it. Our waitress was so familiar with the menu, like it was a superexpensive French restaurant. Food is great. Decor is nice. Definitely a place to return again and again"}
{"text":"I've driven past this place a few times and been told to try their pizza but didn't get a chance. A food lover gave me this pizza to try. And I loved it. The taste tells you this place is doing the right thing by using high quality topping and ingredients and made it with love."}
{"text":"Great food, service and wine list. Real thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"After patronizing this restaurant for 10 years with the utmost pleasure, last night convinced me not to go back.  It appears that the staff have changed, especially the manager, and the service is definitely no longer what it used to be.  It has also become so noisy that It is hard to hear what one's dinner guest is saying. We had two glasses of wine, one of which evidenced a great deal of sediment at the bottom of the glass, which was noticed when the glass was 3/4s consumed.  The manager completely refused to take that glass off the bill, and only offered to charge half the price for it!  As any one familiar with wine knows, serving a glass of wine like that is totally unacceptable.  However, sad to say, the manager was happy to sacrifice our patronage in the future for the cost of a glass of wine!  How foolish can one be!  I hope the owner notices this.  CR"}
{"text":"Seriously, more people should be choosing this place over it's neighbor Terroni. But at the same time, I like that people are still going to Terroni so I won't have to wait at Capocaccia.   The staff here are welcoming and nice and attentive. The food is delicious and there is a lot of selection of salads, pizzas and pastas. I have only been for lunch, and every time I am seated very quickly and the service has been good. It's a pretty big place with two separate rooms, so even at dinner I doubt you'd wait long.  I have tried pastas and salads here, and the portions are generous. The bread they serve to start the meal is so fresh and soft and warm it melts in your mouth. Be careful or you'll find you've eaten the whole basket!! (not that I've done that but I can picture it happening!)  When this place opened I was surprised because it is so similar to Terroni and right across the street, but with good service and tasty quality food, I can see why it's still doing so well."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, great Italian food, many times have I come here with friends and every time it's been a positive experience. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"Great go to true neighborhood place with energy.  Always crowded and yet you can still snag a table. Love the gazpacho in the summer and always go for the buffalo mozarella salad.  Pizzas are a sure thing but try the pastas too...really great meat sauce.  The patio is open and a great place to linger over wine."}
{"text":"Nice italian restaurant. It was a little expensive. The waiter were friendly (maybe too friendly) i asked for a white wine and he offered to bring me something nice without letting me to choose so he gave me a 16$ 5oz. Wine!!  The waiting time was ling but the food tasted really nice"}
{"text":"The pizza was beyond sub par.  There was nothing remarkable with the pizza; simplicity can be elegant if each culinary element was magical.   However, there was nothing that carried the taste of this piece of cheese dough.  I ordered the pizza with goat cheese, prosciutto, and arugula. I felt like I ate cardboard."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here today to try their winterlicious menu. To begin, the server was preoccupied with another table and only came to us when the food was ready. Not even to fill our water (not that we can't do that ourselves of course, don't want to sound snobby).   I had the soup of the day which was a tomato and roasted red pepper. It tasted a little watered downed and lacked flavor. I chose the ricotta ravioli as the main. The dish was not as warm as I would have liked it to be and also lacked flavor. Only flavor was from the truffle oil. My boyfriend has the veal as his main and said the dish was pleasant. We finished with a cheesecake and panna cotta. Cheesecake was nothing special but the panna cotta was good.  Overall, I had higher expectations and not pleased with their food or service. Not worth the $150 we spent here..."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with an early birthday meal here. I had a craving for pizza earlier in the week, so it was perfect.  The Arancini was a delightful start to our meal- these little mushroom and rice balls were mouthfuls of goodness. I would definitely order more of these.  I enjoyed the Agnello pizza with lamb sausage, it was filling and savoury. I would order this again.  The Calamari was a bit too grilled for my liking, but it was still good. I would likely try a different pasta dish next time. Overall, these dishes were delicious and I still savour the taste of lamb sausage the most.   The new \"Torta al Cioccolato\" chocolate dessert cake is a MUST TRY. It's very rich and decadent, and the cherries made it refreshing. The pistachio mousse was a nice compliment to this as well. This approx 3\" cake was a good amount to share between two people, because of its chocolatey richness. I would come back again just for this dessert.   Service was superb! We were checked-in on frequently, water was refilled timely, and overall they were very friendly. Our server was amazing, chatty and raved about the dessert as well!  Huge kudos to Chef Gabriele Di Marco (see menu).  5/5 Recommended. Wonderful food and experience."}
{"text":"This is our go to place to authentic Italian. We ordered the prosciutto board for the appetizer and pasta bolognese and margarita pizza for the mains. All we're absolutely delicious! Great atmosphere. Amazing wine list. Wish we had room for dessert."}
{"text":"Food and service are excellent. Our server even struck our drink orders from the bill because their preparation were taking longer than usual. Waitstaff is attentive and food is authentic and rich. Great selection as well!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful, the service was excellent but when it came to the taste of their food... it was lacking by a whole nine yard. For the price of their food, it is not worth it. I also find, they go somewhat stingy on the topping of their pizza as well, when order a sausage pizza, it's not just four tiny pieces for a medium size like pizza."}
{"text":"Went out for a dinner meeting with a bunch of colleagues and found this place to be nice and cosy. The service was stellar! Tons of personal touch points, always someone watching over the watch pitchers and the manager came to ask how we were doing as well. Ordered the day's special veggie soup with the special truffle linguini. The food was yummy, flavourful and satisfying! Also got a nice bottle of amarone wine for the table (half price Tuesdays!). Indulged in a tiramisu for dessert (which we all shared) and it was probably one of the best ones I've ever had! The only downside was hard to find parking near the place, and it was a bit on the pricey side. I would recommend this place for a great date night or special occasions only!"}
{"text":"I was initially attracted to the decor.  Surprising so many places on Younge street are run down.  Menu is nice -- not too big.  Chef will not do any changes to the menu.  A bit pretentious.  I'm from LA and the nicer the restaurant the more willing the chef is to make changes for wealthy patrons.  Even celebrity chefs come out to great patrons and make anything you want.  Here it seems to be the opposite as places like Terroni won't make changes or customize.  Terroni is much bigger so I understand they have too many customers to do changes but the small places like this the chef should make you happy and not think his way is the only way to eat.  Anyway the food was good.  We had a lovely lunch.  Service was a bit novice.  These are not pros.  I liked it enough to return."}
{"text":"Wow! This menu was incredible. Although I couldn't pronounce anything on it, I knew whatever I chose, I'd be happy with. I went during lunch hour and it wasn't too busy, but busy enough to know this place is a hit! My favorite had to be the pizza special of the day with fried eggplant. The eggplant was sliced thinly and fried, but the best part was that it did not take away from the tomato base or cheese. The spaghetti was also the pasta special of the day. The noodles were cooked a tad over al dente, but so good with red onions and cubed meat. The flavors came together so well and there was just enough sauce. My favorite dessert was the apple crumble tart, the crust of the tart was shaped, but not hard at all. It broke apart nicely and the vanilla gelato was the perfect touch."}
{"text":"I want to give this a 2.5-star rating.  I came here with a party of six on Victoria Day long weekend. We understood that it was busy and that they may have been short-staffed, but the wait time for our food was ridiculously long (at least 45 minutes for our appetizers to arrive!). By the time the food came, we had finished our drinks and were starving. On a positive note, the staff did come to our table to acknowledge the long wait and apologized for it. We didn't make any complaints, but others must have.  Anyway, on with the food... Our table ordered several pizzas (salami, giuseppe, one with ground meat and green onion) and they were very good. They came around with chili oil but did not leave it on the table. Other items that were ordered were the grilled calamari, beef carpaccio, papardelle with mushrooms, and eggplant parmesan - all of which were flavourful and met our expectations. However, nothing spectacular.   I find that many Italian restaurants/trattorias out there are very similar.  They meet the standard and it tastes fresh, but it's no different than the next Italian bistro down the street. The main difference would have to be the atomosphere and the service.  The service, besides the slow wait, was good. We gave them the benefit of the doubt since it was a very busy weekend and they were one of the few restaurants open that day. The atomosphere was modern yet gave a somewhat rustic feel, probably because of the wood tables.   I'm not sure I'd return to the restaurant again. I mean, there are quite a few Italian restaurants around the area, but if one has a long waitlist or is closed, then I may turn to Capocaccia again."}
{"text":"I used to feel sorry for this restaurant because of its sad situated-ness.  I assumed that being next door to Terroni --  the tiger of Yonge Street, hurling out its giant paws and bringing people in by the dozens -- Capocaccia barely eked out a business by capturing the tiger's left-behinds.  But Capocaccia, is a thriving business in and of itself with good quality Italian food, a fun, yet sophistocated, atmosphere and great service.  The prices run rather high, but this inflation is to be expected in Rosedale.  The antipasto platter is reasonable and large and it includes their buffalo mozzarella which is as creamy as a scoop of Haagen Daz."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today with two of my co-workers.  None of had been here before.  My co-workers ordered the zucchini flowers as an appy and said they were okay.  Two of us ordered pizza and the other ordered the mushroom pasta.  All were good and we cleaned our plates.  Our server was friendly, though a bit clumsy (she kept knocking things over like a pop, milk, etc.).  I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Second time at this wonderful Italian Restaurant. I made reservations for a business luncheon. We started off with shared platter of cheese, salami and prosciutto pared with white focaccia. I ordered a kale and wild mushroom salad which was delicious with added shavings of parmigiana cheese. Trying to be good fell short when I ordered the butternut squash gnocchi with sausage, rapini and fennel seed. I always thought my homemade gnocchi were second to none, sadly they would have to take second place to these. Light delicious, and not able to eat more, they were delicious. For desert, I didn't order but sampled the Nutella and ricotta pizza. Two glasses of red I need a pillow I'm in carb over dose. Food, service and location got the full 5 stars from me. They are open for dinner and yes I definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and excellent service! We ordered the marguerita pizza and a white pizza - which I forgot the name but it had pear and walnuts! The white pizza was especially delicious. They're very thin, which I love. Our waiter was authentic Italian and very friendly, which made the experience even better. Oh, and the ambiance is great, very cute place!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times, and the food never disappoints.  They also change up their menu frequently, which can be a plus or a minus if you go with a particular craving in mind that is suddenly missing.  However, the service is so great that when I groaned upon discovering the item I wanted to order wasn't there....the chef made it for me from scratch anyway.  Terrific service!  They offer free bread when you arrive (including outstanding tomato focaccia strips), their assorted meat and cheese platter makes an awesome app, they have a selection of original salads that are all delicious (the beet and the mushroom salads are particularly good), pasta and seafood are fresh and delicious, and the meat dishes are always cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Great wine list, indoor and outdoor seating, staff always willing to accommodate any allergies or special requests, close to the St. Clair subway stop, and a Green P parking lot directly across the street if you're driving.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Went there on Sat Apr21/18 at 7:30pm.  Restaurant is beautiful, upscale.  Greeted at the door by a smiling, attentive host, who I later found out was the owner.  Had the chef's menu ($60) - a 7 course meal where the chef decides what you have.  For each dish, the chef comes out and explains what it is.  Food is amazing!!  Light and rich (does that make sense?  Each course was delicious, but not too heavy.)  Portions were just right, not too small.  By the end we were stuffed.  First course was: fried rice or corn balls with mushrooms inside and bruschetta with goat cheese and arugala.  Delish.  Second course was Caesar salad - a baby romaine lettuce heart drizzled with Caesar dressing, bacon, and focaccia croutons.  Delicious.  I like that the lettuce was cold, it tasted so fresh. Third course was octopus with squid ink polenta.  It was good.  Fourth course was a small-noodle pasta with rappini.  Flavours were perfect in this dish.  So delicious.  Fifth course was ravioli stuffed with mushrooms and goat cheese, I think.  This was the highlight of the show for me, it was sooooo good.  They have this as a regular pasta dish on the menu, but it is so rich, I don't know if I would want a full dish of it.  The tasting menu we were having was a portion of two raviolis.  The sixth course was very rare thin cut of steak seared on three sides and not seared at all on one side.  It was served on top of eggplant and lots of olive oil.  It was good.  Then they offer an aperitif (comes with the tasting menu) of either Lemoncello or some other Italian liquor that kind of taste like Brio.  I had it, it was good.  Dessert was a cannoli that was made in house.  It was delicious.  Cream inside was fresh and the server told us that the pastry was just made in-house.  Service was excellent.  Our server was Dale, he's great, funny, knowledgeable.  Chef came by our table, owner came by our table.  Excellent experience, beautiful atmosphere.  Authentically Italian (Scicilllian).  Highly recommend.  Bill came to $350 with tax and tip for 4 people, 2 glasses of wine ($10 each), one juice ($4), and we all had the tasting menu ($60 each)."}
{"text":"The only problem was narrowing down what to order. The chef is fresh-off-the-boat from Italy (earlier in 2013) so when they advertise authentic Italian, they mean it. Accordingly, he is very reluctant to add cheese to seafood (bonus for the lactose intolerant) but will change other dishes to suit.   Seating options include half-banquettes, tables and the bar. They have a private room available. Reservations are a little complicated (check the website for details).  The options are out-of-the ordinary but not weird. They have an octopus appetizer, as well as tuna tartare. Unusual mains include a sweet potato gnocchi and a brown butter sage ravioli. Lots of wines by the glass, including rosé and prosecco. Excellent bread.  Great service by intimidatingly attractive people. It seemed like they recognized every second person there, so numerous were the regulars."}
{"text":"The food is excellent at Capocaccia. I had the carpaccio which was well seasoned and an ample portion. I followed it with the Madelena salad which combined freshly grilled vegetables and goat cheese over a bed of arugula; exquisite. The icing on the cake was the made to order pizza. You could smell and taste the freshness.   The staff at Capocaccia is warm, friendly and very informative.   I recommend sitting at the bar and enjoying a Negroni with your meal! Two big thumbs up!"}
