{"text":"Their food is great and it's a nice environment. It does get slow when they are busy so just be patient. It is worth it."}
{"text":"Found Bakn through Yelp since it was close to the hotel.  Has the industrial look going inside while a time correct exterior for the area.  Service was prompt and courteous. Food on the other hand was outstanding!  Drink wise I got a screwdriver which was made with fresh squeezed OJ and tasted great. My buddies got the signature Bloody Mary's. Looked good also and was told equally great. Big slice of bacon was included with theirs.  For entree I ordered the Banana Fosters French Toast and it didn't not disappoint.  Chocolate sauce was like heaven.  I give it a 5 stars and the only down side I can think for some maybe the pricing but it is not out of the realm for this area. I highly recommend Bakn."}
{"text":"I've had the braised short ribs and the chicken sandwich. Both were excellent. The service is a little on the slow side. I also expected the bacon to be thick cut vs. normal cut."}
{"text":"You would think by the look of the place that the food would be good. The first time I was there, I got a chicken sandwich, with of course, bacon. The chicken was burnt to a crisp. My wife and I also tried the biscuits with bacon jam. Jam was good, but the biscuits fell apart like they were made of sand. However, we came back to give it a second chance. I had the bacon pancakes cuz that sounds awesome. But, again, the pancakes fell apart like sand too and I like my pancakes to have a slight crisp when I bite into them. Not these cakes, it was almost like the flat top was not hot enough. I feel the cooks either overcook or undercook food here, which makes me mad, cuz the both times we were there, the head chef, in his white costume, was not in the kitchen the entire time we were there. He was shaking hands the first time and then eating the second time. The dude is entitled to eat, but we were there during Sunday brunch. Sunday brunch at a restaurant whose name is the most popular brunch protein ever invented... So um... Get in the effing kitchen, man, or at least eat in the back. Needless to say, this place is trying to look the part, but falls short food wise."}
{"text":"My wife and I dropped into Bakn and were expecting to have a typical gastropub-style dining experience. It's typically our go-to type of dining establishment and there are a ton of great ones in the area. When going somewhere new, I typically ask the server what they enjoy best or would recommend. Our server was surprisingly disinterested when I asked about the shrimp and grits and I found that to be quite off-putting. That led me to get the bacon burger and my wife had the cheddar burger. Both were overcooked and under-seasoned. My burger had a slight amount of bacon on it, but it was not particularly unique or flavorful, which one would expect from a restaurant bearing its name. I would rate the overall quality of our meals as being on par with anything you can get at a typical large-chain restaurant. It could be that we ordered the wrong things. The breakfast options looked and smelled great. If we do go back, we definitely won't be having burgers. Also, I was quite surprised at the lack of unique on-tap beers. In general, if you're looking for a place to have a good sandwich and a few beers, there are a ton of better options (Burgatory, Fat Head's, Industry Public House, The Yard, just to name a few)."}
{"text":"I ate there 3 times the week you opened and at least once a week since.  The Shrimp & Grits dish is EVERYTHIIIIING!!  I truly can't get enough of it.  I was hesitant about the stuffed peppers because of the egg, but it works!  It just works with it and it's amazing.  The BLT is an absolute ridiculous amount of bacon... and I wouldn't change one thing about it.  The signature Bakn Martini is to die for.  It's a good stiff drink that's a little sweet, a little smokey, a little tart.  The first sip I took just tasted like Autumn.  It tasted like I should've had on Ugg boots, black leggings and a flannel while sitting in front of a roaring firepit. I liked everything about the Bakn Burger....except the actual burger.  It needs some attention.  I felt it (the burger itself) was very plain and equally dry.  Like all the good stuff was pressed out of it on the grill.   If not for the bacon on it, it wouldn't have much flavor at all.  Why not put bacon IN the burger.   I also thought it had too much of the greens on it.  Cut down on the greens (or use spinach or something).  Add a kicky mayo.  Maybe sliced avocados as an option.  Just a thought.   I love the whole concept of Bakn.  It's definitely a welcome change in Carnegie.  It's clean, bright, beautiful and simple.  The staff is coming along and getting in to their groove.  I expect that Bakn is going to be another Carnegie icon like Papa's and The Pour House.  Keep doing what you're doing!"}
{"text":"Well we went to Bakn in Carnegie and I feel compelled to  review how incredibly AWFUL it was from beginning to end. The service sucked, once seated we waited 15 min before our waitress came. When she did, she asked what we wanted to order...I don't know maybe a drink!? My Bloody Mary and PEPSI took another 10 minutes. The Bloody Mary was just full of horseradish and nothing else and I LOVE horseradish so come on. The menu looked amazing but no. We got the Reuben and pork belly tacos BOTH dishes were a joke. The pork belly tasted like day old pork chops and the best way I could explain my boring Reuben was that it tasted \"like the color white\". But that's not the worst folks, the clowns showing off and acting like morons in the open kitchen were a disgrace to the industry. I'm not sure what everyone was waiting for but don't waste any of your time doing so."}
{"text":"Food was superb, the waitstaff was attentive and fast. The chef personally takes the time to expo the food and check on the customers. I would definitely recommend this brunch spot! The bakn tacos were awesome!"}
{"text":"Bakn is the perfect place for brunch on the weekend.  Love the casual and friendly atmosphere.  I have visited twice now and always have a hard time choosing what to eat and drink. Everything smells and looks delicious.  The quality of the food is appreciated as well as the great customer service. I look forward to a future visit with some friends to help persuade my next decision on what to try next from the menu."}
{"text":"Loved brunch! The well done bacon was addicting and the home fries, seasoned lightly with rosemary... so good!  The bacon filled buttermilk pancakes - so yummy!  The almond crusted French toast was delicious! Service was friendly and attentive from the moment we walked in the door.  Next visit we are going to try the bacon burger. Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"The service was very good. I had the short ribs. They would have likely been good, but they were served mixed into a mushy bed of polenta that was kind of bitter. Not good. My husband had the pork belly tacos. The meat was good, but the tortillas were uncooked and cold. You need to grill or somehow toast or heat up tortillas. It's a cute place and again good service, but need some work on making food bit better."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch with my wife and kids. Place was busy. We put our names on the wait list and also on the app that calls us when our table is ready - told we were first for a 4-top but most diners had just started their meal and it would be 15-20 mins. Spent 20 minutes milling around the consignment store next door and then 10 minutes standing outside. Went back inside and was told we were the next 4 top. Then some other folks on line started complaining that they had come in and watched people get seated before them and they were tired of waiting. I guess they decided to give them our table, as they got seated on the next table that opened up. They then took a table for 4 that opened up and split in in to 2 tables and seated some others.  The hostess told us that everyone is on the app and gets seated in order - not so! Seems like the loudest complainers get seated before others. The hostess is out of her depth.  At that point we decided to go elsewhere and have no plans to go back ever."}
{"text":"I heard some online chatter about BAKN and decided to give this place a try, how could I resist an entire menu of bacon!   I was more than excited to try the Bloody Mary with bacon-infused vodka, couldn't wait till happy hour...I needed it for brunch ASAP! But to be completely honest, it didn't do it for me for a few reasons. Maybe I had high expectations, but it wasn't what I wanted/expected.   The bacon Bloody Mary was too watery for me. There wasn't much substance to hold it all together like you'd expect. The horseradish was at the bottom with the tomato, the top layer was all water and tomato juice. So I had to continuously stir it just to get a good mix. It wasn't spicy (tasted bland) so I had to add hot sauce when my meal arrived. The peppered bacon garnish was also floppy and not crispy. Nobody likes sad, floppy bacon. :(   It needs to be thicker, give it some Oomph, but not like a bacon Bloody Mary smoothie! And for the love of bacon use a crispy piece of bacon as garnish. Confession: I totally ate the floppy bacon anyway.   The food, however, more than made up for it. My mom ordered the slow braised short ribs with polenta and sunny side up egg and holy heck was it worth it. The plenty was creamy and the ribs were tender. Definitely a good combo!   I had the breakfast sandwich of bacon, egg, arugula , Jarlsberg cheese, and roasted tomato. Phenomenal. Totally worth it. The bacon was crispy, the cheese was gooey, and the roasted tomato gave it a really nice smokey tang.   Overall, for a first visit and for brunch the meal was pretty damn good.  Except for the sad bacon Bloody Mary. I'm holding you guys responsible for setting the bar on a good bacon Bloody Mary, especially if bacon is your thing. Maybe the cocktails are better in the evening with a dedicated bar person. I dunno.  I'll give you guys another try. (Those pancakes sounded awesome!) :)"}
{"text":"Great food, a little tight on seating though. Really unique drink choices too. Not really great for picky-eating kids, though."}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwich #1 was the best I've ever had. My husband loved his bakn omelette. Everything is very fresh. I'm not normally a fan of hash browns but these are delicious. Great atmosphere and great service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"So I saw this great little place on a tv show about new restaurants in Pgh.  Went there for breakfast today.  $8.00 for 2 egg breakfast with bacon toast and home fries.  I asked if I could have a fruit instead of fries and toast and the nice waitress said sure.  I received the eggs and bacon which were great and a small bowl of strawberries and blueberries which were also tasty....so why the 3 stars?.... I got my check for the $8 breakfast but was charged $5 for fruit.   I never would spend $5 on fruit and was blindsided.  Moral is ask if there is an up charge.   I didn't complain to them because it was crowded and probably should have but $5 for fruit is Crazy"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and they have exactly the same menu all day. Guys... breakfast for dinner. Awesome.  Staff was very friendly! Our waitress specifically cracked jokes with us and had an absolutely bright personality. Everything came out quickly. When one of our orders came out wrong, she apologized and got it fixed right away.  For the food. I got the Bakn Bleu Burger, medium. The burger came exactly as I wanted it, nice and pink in the middle. The meat was juicy, the onion jam was sweet, the bacon was crispy and fatty. Overall, all the flavors complimented each other fantastically. I really liked my burger: it was a great burger for the price. Compared to like-priced burgers (BRGR, Burgatory), I would say that I enjoyed Bakn's burger more.  My girlfriend got the breakfast sandwich. It was phenomenal. A nice runny yolk in the inside, fresh arugula, roasted tomatoes, and of course, bacon. Everything worked so well together. I think this is the reason why I will come back. The only thing I wasn't crazy about were the home fries, which were a little too greasy.  Among our group of friends, we got the biscuits with bacon-honey jam. The bacon-honey jam was really good. The biscuits were not what I expected: they were crunchy and hard. I was expecting biscuits to peel apart, or at least cut with a knife, which crumbled to parts when we tried. Still, the jam... so good.  Depending on what you get, it can range from a little pricey to reasonably priced. For example, the bacon flight (4 strips of different types of bacon) was worth about the same as a sandwich.  Overall, I will be coming back for brunch."}
{"text":"Really pleased with the menu and the atmosphere. Good music, not too loud. I had the BLT - it's huge - and my wife had the veggie sandwich. We'll be back for brunch. Looks like a nice bar, too."}
{"text":"I think it hilarious that some people complain because it's to greasy in the reviews!  It's bacon so expect the grease but it's unbelievably good!!  We had the bacon flight for an appetizer, Siracha bacon should be sold everywhere, so GOOD!!!  Just had the pork belly reuben and I may not eat another type of reuben sandwich.  Great food, great atmosphere, great music and excellent staff!!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first time dining at Bakn. I was a little confused when first entering the restaurant . We did not see any sign saying host will seat you. So we stood in front for a good 10 minutes with the bartender making eye contact but not speaking to us. Once we were finally greeted, we were seated at very small table. However food and server made up for first part of evening!!!  I would recommend to others and would return again"}
{"text":"Awesome addition to Carnegie!!  Mimosas were fab, and the menu goes WAY beyond the standard diner options.   Try the short ribs!  They were amazing and tender and perfectly balanced with the polenta and the egg on top was perfect.   The bakn bakn bakn omelette was pretty delicious.  The portions were perfect, and it was awesome with sourdough toast.  The addition of herbs to the homefries made the dish for me."}
{"text":"With a name like Bakn, you better bring home the bacon.  Oh those poor pigs, there's so many different kinds of bacon (pepper, applewood smoked etc.) and breakfast served ALL day?!  Bacon jam even, come on!  Can you tell this place lives up to its name in my opinion?  Awesome urban, modern decor.  Great service-from the servers to the bartenders to the host.  1 lb. bacon BLT?  Done.  Or should I say I enjoyed every morsel and am now in a bacon induced yelping coma?  Yes.   Ok with even with all of that said, you can bring your vegan and/or vegetarian friends here.  We also ordered the kale, quinoa and goji berry salad which was delicious.  Glad to see a place like this doesn't alienate veg heads as I have been one before and have many friends that don't eat meat.  I love main street in Carnegie and I love the new addition of Bakn, I really hope it succeeds."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here on a Sunday for brunch with some friends, and it has become one of our favorite breakfast spots. You have to try the bacon, hence the name. It is located on Main street in carnegie which has quite a few other great restuarants and businesses popping up. This area has been cleaned up a lot over the years. The food was top notch here though, and we plan on eating here again very soon. The only draw back would be the parking."}
{"text":"I have been to Bakn several times and was really looking forward to taking my parents who were visiting from out of town. We knew it would get busy for dinner on a Saturday night, so we arrived at 5:30 and saw several open tables. Unfortunately we had 5 adults and a toddler, so none of the small tables could accommodate us. The hostess said we could sit at the bar overlooking the kitchen, but my handicapped father can't manage the tall bar chairs. We asked if two smaller tables could be pushed together but was told that was \"against the law.\" We would have been willing to wait had the hostess seemed remotely interested in our business. We drove all the way across town to eat at Bakn, but chose to take our money elsewhere because of one unkind employee.  Also, this restaurant is not very accessible to people with mobility issues. I might also add that while I have enjoyed the food in the past, it's overpriced, as are the drinks."}
{"text":"Long wait if you do not have a reservation. Good food and a decent Bloody Mary.  Bacon is good!"}
{"text":"I had at lunch the best grilled cheese of my life! And I do have to say I'm a bit of a grilled cheese expert."}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming. I have been looking forward to trying this place out, especially with all of the good reviews, but I am sad to say it did not live up to the hype. I have no problem paying for a good meal, but this was definitely not worth it. To start, the bloody mary was one of the worst I've ever had. It was watery tomato juice with bland horseradish and a slimey piece of bacon. Took a few sips and set it aside. The caprese flatbread was doused in some kind of pesto sauce and the crust was soggy and doughey instead of thin and crisp. Didn't finish this either. Also tried the bacon flight . . . 5 pieces of bacon, each prepared a different way. 5 pieces of thin, limp bacon that I left on the plate. The only thing I did finish was the soda water (not Perrier or San Pallegrino, mind you, but soda water from the bar gun) for which they charged me $2 and called \"sparkling water\" on the bill, which totalled $31. Next time I head to Carnegie, it will not be to Bakn."}
{"text":"Went for birthday brunch and loved it.  Salmon sandwich was awesome.  Easy to order menu not overwhelming young and hip but not intimating. Service was quick and friendly.  Drinks were tasty.  Had good booze in them. Great for work groups or family outings."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointed with this restaurant, it's not worth the hype. The food quality for the price was honestly not the awful part - it was nothing amazing, nothing awful. However, the service was absolutely appalling. We had called ahead days before to see if a party of 20 could be accommodated, and they said yes and made us reservations. Upon arrival, we were immediately made to feel like an inconvenience by the staff. We were then told AFTER we were served drinks that we could not split the bill. The irony is that after we received the bill at the end, we continued to take up that table space for a full 45 minutes to figure out who owed what for a group of 20 people. It agitated us and ended up cutting into tips they would have gotten had they just split the bill (not to mention the line at the door that had formed). Meals came out incorrectly (um, without bacon?), they ran out of things like ranch dressing, and they got smart when we ordered things that were ON the menu (Angry Orchard, pepper jack cheese) and were told \"we don't serve that here.\" After the meal was paid for (and they did end up allowing FOUR people to pay with separate cards), the waitresses actually came out stating that they were not tipped enough  (which, I assure you, was NOT the case).  If you cannot accommodate a large party, you should be up front about those things. Will not be returning. Took what was supposed to be a pleasant evening to celebrate something together and turned it into a nightmare."}
{"text":"This  sounds really obvious, but if you don't LOVE bacon don't eat here. I like bacon, but I don't LOVE bacon. I eat it maybe once every few months. There aren't very many bacon free items on the menu and if you are looking for a health conscious option your choices are extremely limited.   I had lunch here with a friend. I got the BLT because I was at BAKN so...might as well get bacon. The quality of the sandwich was really good. Fresh ingredients, high quality meat.  I couldn't eat most of it (it has a POUND of bacon on it), so I took a lot back to my office and shared it with co-workers. I also got a side of greens  and it was a really nice fresh salad. Also good fresh squeezed lemonade. My friend had the breakfast sandwich #1. She seemed happy. Our server was really friendly, although rushed (it was PACKED) and the chef came out to greet us which was cool."}
{"text":"I gotta say that I wasn't super impressed with Bakn. The bloody Mary's come in at $9 and there is no bloody mary bar here. I ordered the grilled cheese and it didn't live up to the menu's description of it. Maybe next time, I should try the breakfast food. The menu seemed to jump all of the place from pancakes to dinner entrees. I'd be willing to give it another chance, but I'll skip the blood mary."}
{"text":"I should note that I went to the restaurant during the first week it was open.  The service was pretty slow.   Their exhaust fan wasn't working, which meant grease and smoke filled the air (bacon smell isn't necessarily bad, but it soaked through every article of clothing I had on).   Prices are pretty high ($11 cheeseburger, $8 grilled cheese, $12 BLT), both relative to nearby restaurants and also for the quality and quantity of the food.   My bacon cheeseburger was not cooked to order and another plate at the table had the wrong order.   I'm not sure what it'll take to get me to go back but the bacon novelty won't be enough to overcome my first impression."}
{"text":"Four of us went for a little later lunch this past Saturday and we all enjoyed our visit to Bakn!  Although it's a small place and can get extremely busy, it felt fresh, laid back and welcoming. The choice of music was very nice too-always a plus!  Our server was a little bit more laid back than we are used to but it all worked out.  Two in our group declared their bloody mary's the best they ever had.  Another raved about the mimosa.  My seasonal sangria was nothing spectacular but it was refreshing.  The bacon sampler that we all shared was a hit too.  Everyone enjoyed their meals very much.  I had the salmon with polenta and greens--it was an excellent choice.  My husband had the stuffed cubenell peppers with the egg on top--he loved, loved, loved it!  The menu is diverse enough that everyone should be able to find something.  And, it's creative enough that it feels like you have to move out of your comfort zone to try something that you may otherwise never have for lunch.  It was a good choice!  Definitely a place to repeat.....!"}
{"text":"Seriously, the food is amazing!  Had the #1 fried egg sandwich...would definitely recommend and order again!  Chef Randy visited each table while we were there...you can tell that he loves what he does!  Great atmosphere & super super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian, so my review is sort of not that useless, but I had breakfast here today and it was wonderful! The omelette was awesome and my boyfriend said the bacon was perfect"}
{"text":"There were four of us for a Sunday Brunch with the understanding there would be a wait.  We waited about an hour to get in.  Once we sat, we ordered bloody marys and breakfast.  The bloody marys came out without the advertised Peppered Bacon.  The $9 bloody marys were not that tasty and we asked the waitress and she stated that they were out of Peppered Bacon.  Bakn ran out of bacon.  Not sure why she didn't mention that when we ordered.  She mentioned she would provide a discount and only offered $.90 because she didn't want to get in trouble by her manager (not sure why someone would get in trouble for crediting a meal due to not providing food as described).  The bacon flight costs $8 and get 5x strips of bacon.  That would make each strip of bacon $1.60 each not $.90 which she just pulled out of the air.  Regarding the food, apparently they were going to take it upon themselves to substitute the peppered bacon with another flavor that they chose fit.  We inserted which bacon we wanted.  I ordered the Braised Short Rib bowl, it was okay but I should of ordered two because it is a small portion.  Overall, our experience was not pleasurable and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Surprising modern decor. Beautiful bar with orange juicer machine; can't wait for a Sunday morning mimosa. Sat at the kitchen bar. Good service. Had the braised short ribs and polenta. My spouse had the bakn burger. Both were very good. I could have used more salt though. But it's better to err on the side of less salt. Fries had a salt and pepper dusting. Yum! Chef Randy and the kitchen manager brought us a new item that isn't on the menu yet....bacon maple ice cream. Can't wait for that to be on the menu! Well done. It was worth the wait for this place."}
{"text":"The main problem I had with this restaurant is that the pork belly wasn't cooked correctly. When done right, it can be absolutely delicious but in both dishes we got with pork belly (the reuben and the tacos) it was soggy and undercooked which completely ruined both meals. The server was super nice though and replaced the meals with no problem. We got a kale caesar which was average and a flatbread which was pretty good. Pork belly that isn't cooked correctly is down right gross."}
{"text":"Bakn does not take reservations.  We arrived on Sunday at 10:45AM with a party of 5.  They have 1 table for 5, and would not push 2 smaller tables together.  Anticipated wait of 45 minutes turned into 1 1/2 hrs.  Finally seated, server passes out menus.  Leaves and returns to take drink orders.  Leaves again, returns with drinks, and THEN tells us what items they are out of, which is mainly what we wanted to order.  My Bellini was room temperature and the food was so ordinary.  Surely not worth the wait.  I would recommend waiting a while until this place gets its act together, but I won't return."}
{"text":"Pork belly Reuben may have ruined all other Reubens for me. It is now my favorite sandwich"}
{"text":"I was in between giving three and four stars, but because the blue cheese burger is phenomenal and the fries were pretty good, I gave it four.  Unfortunately, that's the only thing I've had on on the menu.  I imagine I will try the place one more time for breakfast, and probably wont go back.  I do live about 2 miles away.  The waiter was fun and the hostess was very sweet.  Beside that, it is very loud and cramped like crazy. It is very small, always packed, and there is no waiting area. They text you to come back when your table is ready!  Not a good idea for Pittsburgh, when the temps are in the single digits and there is nowhere to wait especially with no parking lot so parking wayyy down the street is common.  The cocktail I had was horrible.  It was some kind of bellini and it tasted like rot gut Boone's Farm haha!.  I did enjoy their cook's and waiters' tshirts though....one of them said \"I like PIG butts and I cannot lie\". lol  Cute!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, humor (cooks shirts), friendly staff and most of all the amazing food.  They pretty much have every detail taken care of to make it a great experience. Had such an awesome time sitting by the kitchen today.  My 3rd visit in 3 weeks and each have been awesome.  I can't wait to try the rest of the menu.  BTW, they even have a great kale salad at Bakn!"}
{"text":"Ugh, not going back. I like healthy food or at least inspired unhealthy food. This wasn't it and the one dish I wanted (salmon) was out. So if you want to eat a glob of fat and wait 40 minutes to get that, go for it. Otherwise just sit at the bar. At least you will get a good drink, quickly."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. I had the shrimp and grits - extremely rich but that's what I fully expected. The bacon spread with the biscuits was awesome, don't miss it! The only thing I didn't enjoy was the Bloody Mary - just too much horseradish."}
{"text":"Name is Bakn and they do not even cut and make their own bacon!!!  Way over priced for Mcdonalds fries and an over cooked burger with a tiny piece of bacon I can buy at Aldi's."}
{"text":"We had heard a lot about BAKN and decided to give it a try.  Everything was delicious from the cocktails to the bacon appetizer (no trouble discerning the difference) to the wonderful sandwiches. Fun atmosphere and it's encouraging to see that area of Carnegie revitalizing. If I had to make any suggestions for improvement it would be to step up the beer list a bit.  Other than that great place. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes before waitress said our food would be a few more minutes. Thought that was a little long for an omelet and cheeseburger. Left. Too bad really wanted to try this place"}
{"text":"Absolutely my fave place to go to for breakfast! I was not a fan of a bacon, until I discovered this place! Get #1 or #2 and get in line first, specially on weekends!!! Chef Randy rocks!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Burgers are delicious and good value.   Drinks and appetizers are a little pricey though.   Bring a coat, it is always freezing inside."}
{"text":"Finally tried Bakn after anxiously waiting for them to open but wasn't really impressed. When we got there it wasn't super busy but still had to wait a few minutes before someone took us to a table. The brunch drink were a bit pricey. 9 dollars for a Bloody Mary made with bankers club vodka. They really need to use a better vodka than the lowest shelve when charging 9 dollars. The food was good. No real complaints on that. I don't think we will be going back though. There are much better brunch places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Had a bite to eat here, \"What can i say????\" Fabulous!! They treat you well, food was appropriate temperature, tasty, cooked the right way!  Need i say more. My husband and kids enjoyed it, and they are \"Picky eaters!\" Will be coming back."}
{"text":"My visit here had me sitting at the bar during a busy weekday lunch period.  I like the location in the revitalizing downtown of this rugged old place (Honus Wagner's home town--some nice history up the street).  The decor is very urban hipster, with concrete floors and lots of corrugated metal.  The space is well-lit by the storefront windows, and the hard surfaces make it a bit noisy at times.  The bar has TVs.  I found the food outstanding.  My bacon flight was really delicious.  I had planned on taking some with for later-HA.  I ate it all.  By myself.  I tried the shrimp and grits (with bacon), and for Northerners, they did a very nice job.  The restroom was very clean and spacious, with cool decor to match the vibe of the joint.  My server was the bartender, and he was good.  They have a nifty orange juicing machine that you can watch if you are seated at the bar.  Fun.  Although my service experience was great, I watched two interesting situations.  I was drinking coffee, and had a steaming hot cup in front of me, when the patron to my left complained that his was cold, even though freshly poured.  The interesting thing was watching the staff respond to this--almost a New York attitude, I must say.  It turns out there was a cold and old pot lurking around the back, and his must have been filled from this.  An honest slip up.   In my book, this sort of thing should be fixed quickly with a smile, no challenging or questioning the patron.  Just get him a new cup of coffee!!  Later in my visit, the patron on my other side had waited forever for his burger.  He had to get back to work, and was very concerned about time.  It was the end of the lunch rush, and maybe the kitchen was backed up.  The manager helped him out financially, but in my mind should have comped the whole meal.  The burger was enjoyed when it came, but for the price, he should have had more time to eat it.  (In my book, anything more than 20 minutes from order to table is excessive, and this was beyond that.)  It was observing these events that kept me from giving this place five stars.  The food I ate was five star.  But the rest of the business was not quite at that level."}
{"text":"Such a great place! I've been there twice now and loved it both times. I had the braised short ribs for breakfast ( amazing!) and the quinoa/kale salad with chicken for dinner (very good). They will be offering local beers soon too but, they have a nice selection of craft brews and cocktails now. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. First off, all of the negative reviews about this place on here are spot on. Sure the place looks nice, the graphic design of the menu makes it seem like you're about to have an incredible treat, and the bar looked alluring. But the first thing you notice when you walk in this place, is that it doesn't smell like bacon. Considering the name of the place, and the obvious allure for bacon lovers, you'd expect a bacon restaurant would smell like bacon. And when the bacon laden items we ordered - 1 pound bacon sandwich, a breakfast sandwich, and almond French toast - came, we couldn't decipher the flavor of the applewood bacon from the pepper bacon...that was sort of weird. As for the French toast, my girlfriend had to sprinkle a sugar packet from the table onto the surprisingly small slices just to get some flavor of sweet. (The less then maple tasting maple syrup didn't help.) And that's the thing we noticed overall, most of the things we had lacked flavor. For example, the hashbrowns were soggy and tasteless. And my girlfriend's coleslaw had no mayo or flavor to it. It was fresh, but tasted like shredded cabbage with a few cranberry pieces thrown in. Needless to say, we will not be rushing to return or bothering to recommend this restaurant. And as for the prices, yes, just as others have said, inflated."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for a Friday dinner. One member of our party asked if instead of french fries as her side, could she get mashed potatoes as we had already ordered a loaded fries appetizer. The waitress said no this wasnt possible, we would have to order mashed potatoes as an additional side. Seemed pretty stingy at the time but we went along with it and ordered mashed potatoes as an extra side. 15-20 minutes later the server comes out and informs us \"I talked to the chef and we are, like, out of mashed potatoes. Would you like fries instead?\"... How can a restaurant run out of potatoes (but not French fried potatoes) early on a Friday night is beyond my comprehension. And to not tell us until right before the food is about to come out? I suspect what actually happened is the waitress messed up the order and didn't want to admit it. We ended up getting charged for the side of fries that we didn't want in the first place. Besides that the rest of the food was mediocre. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect as we entered Bakn as I hadn't heard much about it.  I assumed bacon was going to happen and it did just not in a way thats really worth writing home about.  The place was absolutely packed when we arrived so we waited for quite some time for a table, which is fine, it's a new place.  The interior is cool looking and has a nice ambiance if you don't mind the some noise.  It's all nice and open with tall ceilings that make you feel less packed in.  A list of what was tasted:  Bakn Bloody Mary Bakn Flight Shrimp and Gritz Avacado Toasts  The bloody mary definitely falls into the category of average.  Not watery, but not real good either.  Meh.  It's got a piece of bacon as you could imagine.  The Bakn flight was a total letdown as well.  There are so many interesting ways to showcase and show off the versatility of it bacon, but what comes out is basically a plate of 6 strips of bacon, all cooked exactly the same, but with 3 of them having a different flavor dusted or wiped on.  Maybe one was applewood smoked and the others were cherry....it's seriously just a plate of bacon though.  Snore.  The shrimp and grits were also a let down.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly in some sort of cajun or old bay mixture and they were indeed quite tasty and large.  Unfortunately they lay atop a pile of the most bland grits I've ever had.  They were supposed to be cheddar grits but they were more like boxed instant grits.  There were a few bacon crumbles and some scallions and tomatoes.  Nothing went together to blend the dish at all.  The scallions and tomatoes did have a great flavor and tried to make it a cohesive dish, but it really fell apart.  I didn't personally get a chance to taste the avocado toast, my fiance did and said they were like little eggs Benedict with avocado instead of ham.  She said they were indeed very good.  Everyone at the table did seem to find the toast to be the best part of all the meals.  All in all, it's just a little diner in Carnegie with a few different menu items and overpriced cocktails.    If Bakn was wearing a 'Diners' clothes and not pretending to be a high end brunch spot, it would have gotten a 4 because it is a decent little diner.  Fancy brunch, they take home the 2.  This review was brought to you by the letter G."}
{"text":"Stopped for Wine snd Swine on a Wednesday. Great red wine selection. All went well with the paired bacon foods. Generous pours of wine also. Prices were very reasonable, food was delicious, & the atmosphere was fun. Great music played at the perfect volume. Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"I came here with my coworker on a Saturday for brunch and brought my dog along as this restaurant was listed under dog friendly.   Unfortunately, it wasn't very dog friendly, as there wasn't anywhere to really sit, and the sun was roasting us in the meantime.   Thankfully, the staff was friendly and somewhat accommodating, with a water bowl for my dog, but overall, being in that heat wasn't ideal for anyone.   The food was delicious and I'll definitely order out next time."}
{"text":"It's rare that I sit down to a meal with a craving that I didn't even know I had, and having it fulfilled to perfection. I came to Bakn fully expecting to eat a BLT, as of course they'd have one (I had never been here despite attempts in the past).  As I sat down at the bar and ordered my beer, I noticed they had a breakfast menu as well and immediately my eyes went to the berry pancakes. I asked the bartender if it is served all day and found out the answer was a resounding 'yes.'  Funny thing is, I'm not a big pancake guy (aside from Pamela's), and usually stick to French toast. These pancakes were absolutely perfect: fluffy, sweet, hot and perfectly cooked. Homemade whipped cream, berry syrup, and pineapple/grapes rounded out the plate. I ordered a side of peppered bacon which was surprisingly the only somewhat disappointment as it was likely reheated and not crispy (but bacon is bacon, good even when simple).  I'm not sure if this is a 5 star restaurant on every occasion (time will tell), but it was last night, and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Prices are fair, servings are hearty and the staff is accommodating. The food though is what gets it done. Be sure to feed your parking meter or you will get a ticket"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late breakfast during the work week (so not too many patrons). The food was delicious and the service was prompt.  Reminds me of a place that the bearded, flannel-shirted hipster crowd would enjoy."}
{"text":"Looking for a good end cap to our weekend visit to Pittsburgh, we decided to brunch at Bakn near our hotel on the west side of Pittsburgh. Everything was fabulous. We started with the biscuits and bacon jam and ordered two Bakn favorites, the pancake tacos and breakfast sandwich #1. The only reason for 4 stars was even with using the Nowait app, we had to wait over an hour and a half after checking in at the restaurant. The food was worth it, but make sure you have the time and are willing to wait."}
{"text":"I have been anxious to try this place for quite some time.  This was the restaurant I chose to celebrate my birthday with friends. I ate light all day so I can eat a nice/big dinner and was very hungry. I read all the reviews on yelp which aided in my decision of what I was going to order off the menu.  I arrive in Carnegie and surprisingly, it didn't take me long to find parking on a Friday around dinner time.   Off street parking is available close by.  I arrived a few minutes early than our reservation time and sat at the bar.  The restaurant is small but quaint, trendy and bright. The service at the bar was very good. I was just about to order a drink when my friends arrived.     Ok, I never mind sitting at bar or counter to eat or drink but tonight was a special occasion.  I was looking forward to sitting at table and spending time with my friends celebrating my bday (why a reservation was made).  When we asked to be seated since we had reservations, a young man brought us back to the counter that overlooks the chefs hard at work.    Any other time this would have been ok - but not for this occasion.  The young man talked to a woman who I assume was a manager and she confirmed that the reservation was NOT updated from 2 - 3. My friend had made the change and did receive the confirmation email but the change never went through?   The woman apologized and said the person who took the reservation didnt update and wasn't there.  She offered us a seat a bar until a table was ready.    I know ok what else could you do when the place was crowded and it was Friday night - dinner time.  This is \"WHY\" reservations are made and puzzled at why it wasn't updated.. it's the whole point to a \"reservation\"?  Maybe a computer glitch too who knows?   At the bar we all ordered drinks.  The service was great.  So by the time I finished my second drink we were seated.   I was so glad because was really looking forward to experiencing \"Bakn\".     We were seated at a table near the front window and our waitress was courteous. This is the type of restaurant where you want to order several entrees with a group and having fun sampling each dish.   For an appetizer we ordered the loaded fries  .. scallions and bacon bit.. they delicious...not over done with ingredients.. they were prepared \"just right\".  I love the sides of bacon flavors on the menu..  I ordered the sriracha ..best bacon I have ever tasted:  crispy and extremely flavorful.   For my main course I ordered the \"Slow Braised Short Ribs\" (creamy parmesan polenta, applewood smoked bakn, scallion, tomato, sunnyside Egg.)   Superb!   The combinations of flavors were excellent. I really loved the parmesan polenta!   I couldn't finish (since ate the fries and side of bacon) and took half home and had it for breakfast the next day.     I think this establishment deserves the hype.   Even though we had a minor reservation issue -we were still seated, received great service and the food was excellent.  The prices are slightly about average but it's worth it.  Thanks Bakn!"}
{"text":"Cakes and Chicken with bourbon maple syrup - oh yeah!!!  Order it.   Will definitely be back to try lunch/dinner items."}
{"text":"A real gem! Service is excellent- food is delicious and space has a great vibe! I had The Bakn Bakn Bakn omelette - delicious! Light and fluffy eggs with creamy mozzarella and three, yes three types of bacon! Not at all greasy- a delight! Helpful staff will work with you on food allergies to find what you can eat- awesome! Parking can be an issue, but they are working on it and in the mean time, don't deny yourself this experience. A great community place.  Communal table - wood repurposed from a church in Bloomfield and legs from a bridge abutment. Art by local artist. Replaced the ceiling with acoustic tiles to keep the ambient noise levels down, so you can have a clear conversation at your table. The whole theme based on a little place in New Zealand. Staff is great, owners are real people with a dream and putting in the effort to get it right!"}
{"text":"Sat down, seemed nice. Noticed syrup on the wall behind my date. Come to realize there syrup everywhere from earlier patrons spilling syrup all over (according to the waitress who clearly did not take the time to clean up properly). Then food took a bit, but we weren't in a hurry. Dates food was decent, mine was alright too. Beers (Coors light = $5 a piece = totally ridiculous). Lights too bright, wear shades. Music straight out of the 80's, and not the good stuff. On and end note- hit Rileys next door for the Ruben."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical about the place because of the name and my first thoughts were it was going to be more of a novelty, I am so glad I was wrong. This place is legit.  I had the pork belly reuben (something that I had never even heard of) and it was amazing. The sandwich was the perfect blend of Swiss, sauerkraut, pork belly and some kind of sauce that fit much better than a thousand island. I also had the Mac & cheese which I would also highly recommend.  The service was also great and they get bonus points for having a good beer selection."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait! When you see a Chef taking time to make sure that all of his diners are taken care of, you know he's paying that care to the food too. I have food allergies and he personally came to the table to make sure I knew my food would be safe to eat. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is great. They're BLT is a favorite and the shrimp and grits are out of this world!"}
{"text":"Generally very good food. The 1 pound BLT, pancakes and burgers are winners. Anything I've had with pork belly, Cuban sandwich for example, was just a thick layer of fat.  The staff is great. The atmosphere casual and welcoming.  I'm a beer guy and the 4 taps never include any note worthy craft beers. I would eat there more if I could get a decent beer with my bacon..."}
{"text":"Much of the positive reviews are for breakfast so our negative dinner experience may be due to a busy dinner service.  I would probably give it 2.5 stars if I could.  Sat at the kitchen counter and the operations team looked disorganized.  They mixed up a couple of our orders, but to their credit, corrected mistakes without question and very quickly.  My biggest disappointment was my pork belly ruben.  See picture.  The pork belly looked and tasted like it was boiled and the overall flavor was pretty bland.  Best part was the bread.  Also the rest of the family's food was okay, but nothing noteworthy.  Seasoned fries are very good and it looks like they use fresh ingredients.  Again, maybe our experience was due to a busy dinner service, but that should not be an excuse when there is up to 6 people for the kitchen stations.  The decor and atmosphere is friendly and the service was good.  We may give it another try for breakfast as most of the positive reviews were for breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch spot!  Their build your own breakfast sandwich is out of this world.  My kids are obsessed with the chocolate chip banana pancakes with chocolate sauce.  Their Bakn Bloody Mary is very good, but a little expensive."}
{"text":"A new gem in Carnegie. Good food, good service. We have enjoyed our visit here several times now! Lot's to eat even if you don't like bacon, a dream come true if you do!"}
{"text":"Went to Bakn for my daughters birthday dinner. We were there on a Friday night and were surprised there was no wait as we had been told to expect one. Seated right away and our server came over with menus and asked what we wanted to drink. I asked about a wine list and she said \"we don't have one just tell me what you want\" and I said \"well, I don't know what you have\" she said red or white ( honestly made me feel like an idiot for asking) I said that I wanted white and she replied \"Pinot Grigio, Chardonnay or Reisling\" So I just said Reisling, I wasn't about to ask what kind. Drinks came and it was a good wine. My oldest ordered chocolate chip pancakes, I ordered the pan seared salmon and my youngest ordered shrimp and grits. Pancakes were huge. We could have fed 2 adults easily and they were good. The shrimp and grits were good but I have had better. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the polenta was very tasty. The food itself was pretty good but I just felt like we irritated the server, at least she seemed that way. When we left 2 other servers said \"bye, have a nice night\" I will probably go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic place!  My wife and I enjoyed our Anniversary breakfast here and were not disappointed with the variety of bacon.  The food was great, the owner was filling in for one of the bartenders and she did a great job and took really good care of us.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food delicious. Portions very large.  Please turn down the music.  Loud music was really annoying.  Don't serve cappuccino if you don't know how to make them."}
{"text":"Wow! Love this place. Food was excellent and fresh. The service was superb! Try the shrimp and grits! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"What a find! Went there to try the shrimp and grits and was very pleased.  Authentic,  creamy and the addition of  \"BAKN\" was incredible.  The fresh squeezed OJ was as good as it gets.  Atmosphere and service .....excellent."}
{"text":"Everything we had here was really great but I have to knock them down a couple stars for a few reasons. The service was ungodly slow. It was about a good 15 minutes before they ever came back to get our order after seating us and getting our check took forever too. I also find it to be a bit over priced and I wish they had more of a beer selection on tap. They only had 3 generic beers on draft."}
{"text":"Enjoyed brunch today but was overall disappointed. The mimosa was very good and chocolate chip pancakes; however it's called bakn and the breakfast meat was mediocre. In addition the omelet and breakfast potatoes were just average. I may try this again for dinner but not breakfast. Atmosphere was very cute and what may bring me back."}
{"text":"Our visit started out pretty disappointing. We had made reservations with the nowait app. When we arrived there were open tables that were \"reserved\", but weren't reserved for us. Since we were on a time crunch, we made reservations for our group brunch. We were told we could wait, or sit at the bar in the back. We had to sit at the bar facing the kitchen and cooks and inconveniently talking around each other to hold a conversation. The only this that made this trip worth it was the delish food! Bloody Mary was okay, not worth $10 in my opinion, but the food was bangin'!"}
{"text":"My mom wanted to go there so we went for dinner. I ordered grilled chicken sandwich hoping to bypass consuming any bacon. I don't really like bacon but my mom does. Of course my sandwich came with two strips of applewood smoked bacon. I didn't want to make a scene so I took a bite and it was very good.  Mom had a waffle and bacon and she enjoyed it.  Food was good but friendly service was better.   Second visit did not go well.  Went to dinner and had a short wait. No big deal. After our drinks came we were forgotten about. The people next to us were seated 5 min after us and had their food before we even gave our order. Poor service. Double charged for a sangria after we were told they sold out. They were not so we were not charged for a ice tea   Waitress discovered the overcharge to her credit. My burger was very well done (we were no asked how we wanted our burger done)Chef served us the food and he was friendly."}
{"text":"Wonderfully trendy spot for a bacon-themed bite! I have yet to encounter an item on the menu that's anything short of delicious. Bakn's burgers are extremely tasty, and I love their shrimp and grits with bacon. Service is always very friendly and on-point. Five Stars!"}
{"text":"Used the NoWait app to save time going on a Sunday afternoon, which was great because it was packed! The chicken sandwich and fries I had were really good, but there was something off about the bacon Bloody Mary, almost like it needed more tomato juice/mix to thicken it up. The music was really loud too, but my friend said it hasn't been like that the other times she was in. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service was really great, but burger was mediocre and expensive. My friend got a breakfast sandwich and it was much better. Overall, it was good but I likely won't be back."}
{"text":"this place was soooo goood, service was excellent and the food was amazing. highly recommend this to anyone looking for a delicious brunch place!! their home fries are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Living in the area, I'm still a huge fan of Bakn. Since it's opening we've been a number of times for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The staff is always friendly and the food has been very consistent. The shrimp and grits is still one of my favorite menu items, but I recently ventured outside my comfort zone to try the pancakes on a recent visit. Banana. Nutella. Pancakes. Need I say more? I was worried they might be a bit too sweet, but this may be my new favorite menu item. The pancakes are not heavy at all, they are light and airy and perfect. The bananas were cooked into the pancakes and the nutella sauce was served on the side so these can be as indulgent as you'd like. Definitely a must-try on your next visit!  I've also had the braised short ribs, the salmon and the burger. All were great! On a recent visit they promoted that they are having nightly specials - my favorite being wine and swine Wednesday! They also started a Sunday dinner series that I certainly want to try!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Bakn, I really did. The atmosphere, decor and location are great for this place. And the concept is great too: everyone loves bacon, right? But the food is very disappointing. The first time my husband and I went, he got a grilled chicken sandwich and I got the breakfast sandwich #1 (recommended by the waitress). We also shared the bacon jam and biscuits. My husband's chicken sandwich, the chicken was burnt to a crisp so all you could taste was char. My breakfast sandwich was ok, better than the chicken sandwich. But it was so incredibly greasy. The bacon jam was pretty tasty but it just didn't go well with the biscuits, considering the biscuits were crumbly and dry. They were more like scones than biscuits.   We gave Bakn a second chance and ordered the bacon stuffed pancakes and an eggs breakfast. The pancakes, what a nightmare. They were so crumbly and dry. And the eggs breakfast, there's not much you can screw up but Bakn managed to cook the home fries to the point they were chewy and inedible.   All in all, the menu looks and sounds amazing, but certainly does not taste so great."}
{"text":"Overall, very good restaurant. It seemed they were a little under staffed the day I was there as we waited about 15 minutes before a server even came over to us. Wait time from ordering your food to when it finally comes was a little longer than expected as well, but we were compensated with an order of free bisquits. Definitely going back and hoping that they have more people working next time."}
{"text":"I have lived in Carnegie all my life and when this place came around I was wanting to try it but never found the time or they were always busy. A friend and I finally bit the bullet and gave it a go: and boy was it worth it. The atmosphere is calm and beautiful, the cools are in full view so you can see the flames and hear the sizzles. The food tastes fantastic. And the prices are adequate to the portions you get. We are definitely bringing our other friends here to see what they think. You gotta give this place a try."}
{"text":"I never thought I would want my eternity to be spent in a small trendy restaurant in Carnegie PA ... and I mean eternity.  Throughout all of time.  because if I could spend my forever indulging on bourbon flights paired with different flavors of bacon .... I would gladly start praying to whatever bourbon bacon God I need to to accomplish this ....  Ok ... Back to Earth.  This is a truly awesome and unique cafe\restaurant. The bartender I talked to KNOWS her bourbon which is oddly sexy, and their food is really good.  This place makes me feel really really bad for vegans.  Yea, you may live longer ... But Bacon makes life better ..... and BAKN delivers."}
{"text":"Excellent food. But be prepared to wait. Party of five around 1 pm on a Sunday - we only waited about 10 mins for a table, but our food arrived literally an entire hour later. Ugh. No acknowledgement, explanation or apology from the wait staff. Disappointing.  The Fresh Berry Pancakes were heavenly - and enormous (definitely a shareable portion.) The Shrimp and Grits was especially good. And the Chicken & Cakes was some really great chicken!  I think our advice for next time might be to order an appetizer to take the edge off while we wait."}
{"text":"So, I've been wanting to try this place for a really long time. I have heard some legit things and the reviews were raving. I'm sad to report that I have to give Bakn 3 stars because I wasn't wowed (and because 3.5 doesn't exist). I will say right now that it is a cute little place in Carnegie, and I will def come again.  The menu wasn't overwhelming, but it was kind of hard for me to figure out what was going on, and that might have been just me. I decided to get the chicken and cakes, which was their version of chicken and waffles. I liked it, and it may have been mental, but I prefer waffles to pancakes with my chicken. My bacon to pancake ratio was a little light, but I think that is a gentle balance that needs to be decided by powers higher than me. Like bacon God's or something. All in all, this was a decent experience, but it was kind of hyped up for me, and it didn't deliver to the full expectation."}
{"text":"Really wanted to love BAKN. Interesting menu and decor attracted us to give it a try. What can I say? It just wasn't a good experience. Meeting friends and decided to start at the bar. The bartender seemed lost as fumbled his way through our drinks, asking me how to make a \"Rusty Nai\"l and guessed wrong on a friend's \"Cosmo\". Adding to commotion, bartender functions as coffee Batista for waiters, another distraction for the inept bartender. By the time our table was ready, we had the \"pleasure\" of observing a manager (owner?) terrorize and humiliate a waitress for what appeared to be a minor mistake (dinner and a show?).   Because of its convenient location and attempt to be something special, our friends agreed to give BAKN another try. Sadly, our 2nd visit was similar to the 1st, it seemed like \"Groundhog Day\". Apparently, management prefers criticizing employees to actual training. Despite the interesting concept, poor management is likely to spell doom for BAKN."}
{"text":"This place somehow pulls off being a diner with a trendy atmosphere and theme, a full bar, kitchen-bar seating and fantastic food...all while feeling like part of the Carnegie neighborhood.  I couldn't have been more excited when the hostess asked me if I wanted a seat at the kitchen-bar. I felt like a kid who was getting a tour of the place while I was waiting for my food.   Food. Fantastic. Atmosphere. Comfortable & trendy. Price. Very reasonable.   Like a lot of other folks have said here, it's nice to see a place you genuinely want to see succeed.   Word of advice. Bakn Flight."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Our waitress was terrific but there did appear to be one kitchen slip up and our frittata took a little longer. However, everything was worth the wait. The bacon flight was delicious. The Bakn tacos were everyone's favorite. The frittata was well prepared and very flavorful. Even the bread served with the frittata was outstanding. My daughter had the bananas foster French toast. It was great but a little too sweet for me."}
{"text":"I really tried to like Bakn. Everyone else does, but I just can't do it. The tomato soup is basically marinara in a bowl. The salad had bits that were rotten and was just not that great. I admit, I was pretty put off by the rotten kale. The cookies were good though..."}
{"text":"The following is a Buzzfeed style review of Bakn's awesome brunch:  \"5 Reasons to Brunch at Bakn\"  1. The atmosphere is trendy, open, energetic, and fun. 2. The service and staff are friendly, fast, and professional. 3. The biscuit and Bakn jam appetizer was a savory blend of bacon and deliciousness. 4. The braised short ribs and polenta will knock your socks off. 5. The shrimp and grits will also knock your socks off.  All in all - amazing brunch!"}
{"text":"I love Bakn. How can I not love Bakn when its name is Bakn? Every time I come here I leave smiling. The place has a lovely, comfortable interior with artwork done by one of the owners - talk about a personal touch. Unfortunately, I've never made it here for brunch, which is my biggest end-of-year regret right now because their pancakes look AMAZING.  But at least lunch and dinner here have not disappointed me yet. Bakn has some very tasty burgers and sandwiches, as well as a line of grilled cheeses that I really want to try. The most recent example I have is that during a visit I added Bakn jam to my veggie sandwich (you have the option of adding it, avocado or a fried egg to everything). Obviously I don't recommend adding the bacon to my vegetarian diners, but I can confirm to anyone who steps in that meat and vegetables alike are cooked well and topped off with some delightful sauces and toppings. And that bacon jam was sweet and divine and yuuuuuuuummmmm - heads up carnivores, you must try that jam!  So sure, I desperately need to return one day for brunch - how's that for a 2017 resolution - but no matter what time of day you dine here, you really won't be disappointed. Pancakes and grilled cheese and cocktails all await me here in 2017 and I can't wait to try them all at this local favorite!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely above average.  Get on Nowait before you leave the house to avoid any waiting around for a table.  The atmosphere is great. I love the decor.  The food is pretty good.  My friend got the Bakn omelette.  i was afraid it would have too much bacon, but it didn't.   The potatoes and potatoes that came with it were great, too. However, I totally picked the wrong things to order. The waitress pointed out two things on the St. Patty's day special menu.  Corn pancakes with blueberry compote and pork belly and the Guiness fries.   I got them both and then were just ok.  Didn't blow me away.  I should have stuck to the traditional menu, especially since it was our first time here.  I will definitely be back to try other things.  Like I said, it was all definitely above average."}
{"text":"Initially came here on a Friday morning for brunch. Our waitress Debbie was amazing! She highlighted menu options and gave suggestions for us \"out of towners.\" We even asked about paying for parking and she gave us some quarters for the meter.   I ended up getting the buttermilk pancakes and a flight of bakn. I loved the pancakes and the warm syrup complemented the dish very well. I normally don't like powdered sugar on my breakfast items but this didn't bother me in the slightest. The bacon flight was very flavorful and worth trying; they give you 6 decent sized pieces. The brunch punch was also good. It paired well with the bakn flight appetizer.   I also came today. Our waitress Michelle was just okay. Once we sat down, she immediately came over and asked what did we want to eat. No offer of suggestions, time to look once the menu, or a welcoming smile. She only checked on us at the very end; I only saw her as we were ordering and when we finished. I got the buttermilk pancakes again; excellent! The candied bacon was even better than I remembered. Just the right amount of sweet. I tried the home fries which were okay with ketchup. They are deep fried as opposed to being sautéed on the stovetop. Mimosa was great.  Overall great experiences! The food was phenomenal on both occasions. I recognize that Michelle may not have been as friendly due to the busy crowd. Would definitely come here again if I were in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! My dad absolutely loved this place when he visited from out of town! Great meals at any time of day!"}
{"text":"Given the name, I decided to order the blt salad. It was delicious with mixed greens, fresh tomatoes, sliced avocado, crispy bacon, homemade croutons and buttermilk basil dressing. The bacon was definitely the highlight-super thick and flavorful with a nice crunch.   I came over my lunch break, and the service was very quick. Our salads came out in minutes. I'll be back for brunch."}
{"text":"Yelp's Sizzlin' @ Bakn event was my first with this fun group and what a great place to start.  The food came in four waves (as we came late and missed the pork belly - bummer) and we were thankfully perched near the awesome open concept kitchen area so we got the \"first pass\" of most of the tastings.  I loved the Graceland Grille sandwich featuring peanut butter, banana (yes BANANA) and bacon on thick cut grilled Texas toast.  Really tasty.  Their service was really terrific and the owner/chef were gracious hosts for a lovely evening.  For the grilled cheese course, we liked the fig and bleu cheese and pesto tomato offerings.  Keep up the fab bacon recipes!  Great addition to Carnegie."}
{"text":"I want to love it--great atmosphere, nice drinks, and enticing menu. But, gave it 4 tries and haven't enjoyed the food once. Always cold and overlooked."}
{"text":"Brunch at Bakn is always worth the wait for the Bloody Marys and Mimosas alone. They make fresh squeezed orange juice in house which makes a delicious mimosa. Breakfast is always fantastic. I usually opt for the standard bacon and eggs, but I'm also a sucker for their BLT which uses a full pound of bacon."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. Food was fantastic. I had fresh squeezed orange juice, the grilled cheese with added bacon, which was one of the best I've ever had. The French fries were great too. Although I usually am not a fan of fries, theirs are definitely the exception. They toss them in rosemary and some other herbs. The little extras are what make this place. Service was great. I've already recommended it to several people. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and drinks with a friend about two months ago and I've been recommending it to just about everyone since. I have a sweet spot for places in town that are off-the-beaten-path and aren't so well known that everybody and their mothers go there. This is that place and definitely worth the trip to Carnegie.   The Bakn martini is smooth and balanced with a smoky after-taste and it seriously might be one of my favorite cocktails of all time. I'm a sucker for polenta so I had the slow-braised short ribs and thought it was good and an interesting dish but felt like my bowl was a little luke warm. For my next drink, the waitress recommended a bourbon and bacon pairing trio - three different types of bourbon and three different cuts and seasonings of bacon. Even without the fabulous Bakn martini, I would come back for this alone. We also tried two of the dessert cups (I honestly don't know how we even ended up with them) and I didn't love them, only because I was so in love with everything else.   South Hills and western suburbs kinfolk, get to Bakn if you haven't already."}
{"text":"When I'm back home to Carnegie to see my parents, I love having the opportunity to try out one of the several new places that have been popping up on and along Main Street. My favorite so far of the bunch is Bak'n. After throwing our names in on NoWait (already a bonus!), my mom and I made the quick drive down from Cubbage Hill and they had a table ready for us within minutes. I ordered the Breakfast Sandwich #1, which was a combination of bacon, egg, cheese, tomato, and greens. Sounds standard, right? Not so at Bak'n. The bacon was chewy, thick-cut perfection that stood up well to the thin layer of fried egg in the middle and the creamy Jarlsberg cheese the warm egg was just starting to melt. The greens: fresh, peppery arugula. My favorite parts of the sandwich, though: 1) the fact that the tomato was oven-roasted, as opposed to your standard raw slice of tomato (which, in January, you know is going to be subpar), and 2) the generous (but not to the point of overpowering) slather of Bak'naise that tied the whole sandwich together. I could barely touch my side of home fries, which were flavored with rosemary--I did manage to get through the extra-crispy bits, though :) Thanks, Bak'n--way to bring one home for Carnegie!"}
{"text":"Ordered the breakfast sandwich #1 ... Very tasty, the roasted tomato is a great touch, and a bit of arrugula. But the bacon got a bit soggy on the sandwich, so I was disappointed with the lack of crisp and that it was slightly underdone. The side of breakfast potatoes were great! Well seasoned with rosemary and sea salt. I'd go back and try some of the other dishes next time. Service was fantastic, everyone was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The staff was so friendly! We both had the Bakn Burger which was cooked perfectly. Fries & Slaw were some of the best. My little at his entire plate of pancakes and fruit.. possibly due to the decadent homemade whipped cream!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used Nowait to check-in. After arriving 2 minutes after we got the text that our table was ready, we waited another 5 minutes in the restaurant before anyone even acknowledged that we were standing there. After we were sat, it was close to 10 minutes and still no one acknowledged us or offered us drinks. I had to go up to the bar and ask for two waters and for someone to take our order. The bartender rolled her eyes at me and then brought waters a few minutes later. After watching them sit other people, they were greeted with the menu overview, specials and asked if they wanted anything else besides water.   So we order the biscuits for a starter and the pancake bacon tacos. After waiting about 20 minutes for the biscuits, I ask the waitress if they are coming out before the actual food. Her response \"I hope so\".  So they bring us out the biscuits and there's 4 instead of 5. We ask the waitress, she said she will check on it. Then came back over and said the kitchen knew there was only 4 but didn't want to make us wait for the 5th. 15 minutes later we get our food, still no 5th biscuit. So we ask again, and instead of an apology she tells us she will take it off our bill because she doesn't work in the kitchen so she ant make them bring the missing one out sooner?   Overall the food was really good and probably the only reason why the place is still open. They are incredibly understaffed and the staff that was on none of them seemed like they actually wanted to be there or even liked their job.   I am giving two stars Instead of one because I would order food from there again but only if it was takeout."}
{"text":"Went for brunch- Bloody Mary - awesome - came with a pickle, pepperocini and a slice of bacon- yum!!  Almond crusted French toast - mind blowingly delicious - you must get this!!  Bakn's version of chicken and waffles is pancakes sprinkled with bacon crumbles and green onions and a couple of pieces of chicken-it was just ok. The chicken was perfectly crunchy - I just wish it was a little more flavorful - maybe they needed to be pounded out more or more seasoning on the chicken before it was cooked? the crunch level was perfect the seasoning needed a little work.  Service was good - would totally come back and try the shrimp and grits."}
{"text":"What can you say about a place called Bakn?  You know it's gotta be good, and it truly is!  They make no apologies for their delicious selections that include, what else?  When you think you might have ordered too much bacon, it ends up tasting just right.  The atmosphere and enthusiasm of its staff are perfectly matched."}
{"text":"Incredible!  From the sumptuous food, to the personable servers/staff, to the quirky wall art - all fabulous.  I was with a large-ish group (11) and they handled it perfectly.  Even though they were rather busy, the owner/chef visited our table several times, chatted with us to make sure all was well, and refilled our coffee as needed - much more than the typical obligatory, \"Is everything okay?\"  I love that personal touch.  I had the bacon-stuffed pancakes (it has a much more clever name on the menu) with a side order of grits.  Both were excellent - the pancakes were huge and delicious.  But the grits stole the show - extremely flavorful and just the right texture.    Everyone in my group enjoyed their meals - from specialized omelets, to flat breads, to pan seared shrimp and grits, to fried chicken & pancakes, all the way to regular ol' scrambled eggs, bacon, & home fries - all were exceptional.    One more thing that will keep me coming back for more... the 80's music!  :)  Well done, Bakn!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with my wife on a Tuesday. We both enjoyed are selections. I can say one of the best breakfast sandwiches Around, if not the best. We also shared a French toast plate, which was also very good. I highly recommend that you eat breakfast here."}
{"text":"Not sure I've ever ordered an appetizer at breakfast, but the flight of bacon let me plan out which bacon-enhanced delicacy I was going to try in addition to being delicious all on its own.  Went with the bakn-bakn-bakn omelette and was delighted.  Mozzarella gave it the cheesy texture but stayed in the background and let the bacon show off.  No wait when I went, but I could see parking being a little intimidating for a non-local.  Service was quick and pleasant."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is really an accurate description of this place.   I'm a big fan of bacon, so I figured why not check it out.   A few friends had mentioned that they liked it too.  Upon arriving at Bakn, I was impressed with the venue.  It had a nice vibe to it, and I loved the artwork on the walls.   I saw on the chalk board that they had a $5 pork belly slider special.   We asked for that as a starter.  Our server said that she didn't think that was an option because of some tap takeover that was going on.  I told her that it's right on the chalk board, and she said that she'd have to check and get back to us.   They did have sliders, but they were pulled pork.   Fine.   If only there were some way to update chalk boards, they could have avoided this trouble...  First, the arrival of the sliders:  We were greeted with two sliders.   Normally, I'd expect 3 to an order, but they never specified, nor did I ask how many there were.  They were OK, but the pulled pork I make in my slow cooker is much better!  The meat wasn't smoked, so that means that the sauce and bun have got to shine.  The sauce had a cheap nondescript grocery-store BBQ flavor, and the bun was just a standard white bread bun.  Yawn.  The flatbread:   We went with the fig and blue cheese, and added bacon.  Overpowering all other flavors was the sugary sweet fig jam of a sauce.  If my eyes were closed, I don't think I could have told you that the cheese was blue cheese.  There was also arugula and bacon on top, but I couldn't taste either over top of all the sugar.  The salad:   Field greens with crispy pork belly.   I don't know if they just grabbed the wrong pork belly or if they don't understand what crispy means.   But this belly was the opposite of crispy.  Consistency-wise, think tepid Wonder bread soaked in water.  The croutons weren't crispy either.  They were stale, hard, and a bit chewy.  Who knows... maybe breakfast is the way to go with this place.  I won't find out, though.  $40 for our split light dinner of consistently sub-par food isn't a thing that would draw me out to Carnegie again."}
{"text":"As any experienced diner may know if the name of a restaurant gives you a hint just go ahead and take it... that's right, if you choose to order something that is not bacon or does not contain bacon you are missing out, at best, setting yourself up for failure at worst. If it's you're first time I recommend the bacon flight, with six flavors of bacon this is a tasty investment...for your first time...if you trust me enough to jump the gun just get a full order of the Cajun bacon and skip the other five. Now for food get either the bacon cake tacos or the cakes and waffles. Why? They are in boxes on the menu and obvious signature items. The price is intense but the cakes are so full of bacon and egg it really is enough for two people to share. My friend tried the shrimp macaroni and cheese (not heeding the aforementioned advice) and it was classically decent, hardly one of the best Mac and cheeses you'll find in Pittsburgh. Overall the menu is robust, the service is good and the concept is great. Just dont make the mistake of not getting the bacon or bakn, if you catch my drift."}
{"text":"If I could I'd do 3.5 stars but benefit of the doubt is in order given the Thursday HH special of $5 draft craft beers on Thursdays. Seems more of a lunch and bfast spot v dinner but our dinner (shrimp and grits / chicken and cakes) was good. A nice little spot in Carnegie on the front edge of a hopefully upswing for the local food scene. I'll be back for more bakn for breakfast."}
{"text":"Not much of a breakfast food eater but wow there breakfast was fantastic! The avocado toast and breakfast sandwich #1 are my favorites. Everything you taste you can tell is fresh and it's not your typical breakfast sandwich or avocado toast they're very unique and tasty. The only down side for not giving it a 5 was service was kind of slow with refilling water and waiting for check and the return of it."}
{"text":"Bakn is pretty darn good! I have been there a few times now, and each time I've loved what I ordered. The brunch cocktails I've had have all been good, and fairly strong (yay). Service has always been very solid as well. When I went with my mom and aunt, who are notorious for always splitting things wherever we go, they actually brought out each half on separate plates which I thought was sweet of them. It may not seem like a big thing, but it was nice and we appreciated it!  My one issue is that it's kind of expensive for what it is. I think they are going for the upscale brunch vibe, but the prices are even higher than some of my favorite brunch spots downtown. It's definitely good, and if I'm in the area I would continue to stop by for brunch!"}
{"text":"Stopped at Bakn for breakfast with my son on our way to the airport.  My wife and had talked about trying it, but had not yet had the opportunity, so this was my first visit.  I ordered the frittata which was served with mushrooms, sautéed red onions and home fries and topped with lightly dressed arugula.  The combination was delicious.  My son ordered a breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese, tomato, bacon and the lightly dressed arugula served on toasted sourdough bread.  He really liked the combination as well.  We both had fresh squeezed orange juice and my son had a caramel latte.  Both were very good.  Our first visit was a success.... I'll be back with my wife in the near future to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Went to Bakn for the first time the other day after wanting to go for months. I had trouble deciding because everything looked so good, so I asked the waitress for her recommendation. She suggested the short ribs, which come with polenta. Brilliant idea. They were so delicious! My boyfriend got the bacon stuffed pancakes which were dense and filled with bacon. They were the width of a plate - had to get a to go box! Can't wait to go back and try some other things. I can see why it's a popular place. Anther perk- you can get mimosas and breakfast all day!"}
{"text":"So glad I finally got to eat here. I've heard about it for months and have been dying to try it. I got their \"#1 breakfast sandwich\" with the homefries and I thought it was delicious. Also mimosas are good. Service is really friendly. Very family friendly place. Looking forward to going back for lunch or dinner to get the 1lb BLT"}
{"text":"Ate here on Sunday morning and it was amazing! They use the No Wait app so I put my name on the list before we even left the house. The hostess asked if we would sit at the kitchen bar, i said of course. Who doesn't like watching their food be prepared?  The mimosa and bloody were some of the best i have ever had. The drink menu had something for everyone. We had the Bananas Foster French Toast, Fritatta and Bakn Bakn Bakn omelet. It was so much food and delicious!  We cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First time at Bakn...an hour drive just to come eat some delicious bakn! Used the no wait app on a busy Sunday morning and the wait was approximately 50 minutes. Our wait turned into 1.5 hours but Chef Randy was more than accommodating and apologetic about the wait.  We were promised appetizers upon sitting down at our table and he sure did deliver! Our meals were all delicious and he personally came over to thank us for waiting and sticking around to enjoy his menu! He also brought us fresh cookies to say thank you once again!! We will definitely be back. Can't say enough about the food, atmosphere and Chef Randy!!!"}
{"text":"Have been searching for some good chicken and waffles since eating some down south and have been unsuccessful until trying the chicken and cakes here. They aren't waffles obviously, but the cakes are super light and airy with some bacon bits on them and the chicken is perfect. I've gotten this dish a number of times already. Have to try the flights of bacon as well!!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience!   Drinks: Sunshine Mimosa & Brunch Punch were both fantastic.  Food: The #1 Breakfast Sandwich was phenomenal. Bakn Bakn Bakn omelet was delicous. Oh, and those biscuits with Bakn jam.... swoon!   Service: Awesome. Even on their first day they completely had it together!   This is hands down the best brunch place in the Pittsburgh area.  Will be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"The food selection here is very unique but everything we tried was delicious! I had the shrimp and grits. So good! I also loved the atmosphere, very cozy!"}
{"text":"Made my first trip to B?kn last night. The space is great, lots of bar space, bright, fun atmosphere. I was a little confused by the mix of sandwiches and breakfast, but it truly is a combo of everything bacon.  I had the pork belly tacos. The pork belly was tender and a hefty portion. I went with the mixed greens as a side. I don't know what the dressing is (some sort of white balsamic maybe?) but it was fantastic. I'd eat that salad all day long.   Our server was a little off. She seemed genuinely surprised that I ordered pork belly and felt the need to describe how thick and fatty it is. I'm very familiar with pork belly. But she didn't bat an eye when my male dining companion ordered the same. It was just odd and felt judgy.  She didn't come back to refill drinks at all or to check on our meal. We had to chase her down for the check. It was 7 on a Sat night, so it was fairly busy, but there were empty tables so not unreasonable. Staff is the reason for the 3 stars.   I'd go back to try the pancakes, they looked delicious!"}
{"text":"Had a business lunch there. Very yummy. Expensive but yummy. Parking is rough but a good place."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we did not get to try the food. Walked in and the hostess was EXTREMELY rude. I have heard good things about the food but as far as the service goes, I can say first hand I will not be trying this place until they replace the girl greeting customers!!! I should have asked to speak to a manager instead of just leaving."}
{"text":"I love Bakn.  A statement that works on so many levels.  I love the service here.  The bacon dishes are exactly what you are expecting.  My favorite dish though is the short ribs and polenta.  Great to stop in for appetizers and drinks to top off a night with friends."}
{"text":"Great Saturday family lunch. Had to wait about 20 minutes but well worth it. The music was loud but a fabulous mix of 80's danced music, you gotta love Blue Monday blaring through the speakers.  We had our teenage daughters with us, ordered shrimp and grits, the frittata, an egg sandwich and french toast. It was all great. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Much love to this small little restaurant. Both times I've been here have been really great. The Bakn Burger is just to die for! And their drinks are fantastic to boot. It definitely gets busy and a little backed up, but totally worth the wait in my opinion. Also, do yourself a favor and get the bacon bourbon ice cream....ridiculous."}
{"text":"Good food and kid friendly. I had the pork belly tacos and he had the burger. Nothing knocked our socks off."}
{"text":"Bak'n is worth the wait! A few people have commented on the wait and food times which had me prepared. Going for the experience and being ok with taking longer I was ready for the bacon and good conversation. After putting in a reservation on the no-wait app, we still had to wait, but enjoyed a drink at the bar (luckily there were enough bar-seats for us) then made our way to the table.  We got a bacon sampler (6 different kinds of bacon)... delicious, but you have to be ready for the price tag I think it was $10. Fun to do this time, probably won't spring for it again. My favorite was the pepper bacon, but siracha was up there too!  Meals around the table included the pork belly tacos (YUM!), the #1 breakfast sandwich (sooo good!), chicken and cakes (seriously, the chicken was delicious!!), a flat bread (good flavor, but was pale in comparison to the other items) and a salad (let's be honest, I didn't try that because everything else was soooo good!). The bloody mary's and mimosas were all enjoyed at the table.  So, plan for a morning adventure, go with good company, and enjoy the bacon!  I should also mention that the first time we were introduced to Bak'n was at the Yelp! Swing into Summer event in June - the bacon jelly and the bloody mary samples had us all excited to go try this place out -- and it's nice to see something come up in Carnegie for a few minutes outside of the city."}
{"text":"Startin off with this is a cool little diner looking place, where a lot of things are made with bacon or from other parts of the pig..."}
{"text":"Service sucked and the food was overrated. I stopped in this place as I was visiting the area for the weekend. I saw positive reviews and it was close to the hotel but I would not recommend this place. The staff forgot our food and refused to tell us how the menu options changed from the Yelp page, despite specially asking. They tried to make up for their mistake by bringing out new eggs but it was too late. We were ready to go. They also decided to give us our drinks for free but again, it was too late. Nothing could have made up for the poor service and mistakes at that point."}
{"text":"What can I say..... I really liked it.  This a small trendy bar and brunch restaurant.  They have creative breakfast dishes and sandwiches mostly with a bacon accent.  I tried the pancake tacos which were pancakes with eggs, cheese, bacon, cilantro and syrup. DELICIOUS.   A must visit for breakfast, bacon or brunch fans."}
{"text":"I came by myself seated at the bar immediately. Service was awesome and the pancakes more than perfect. Best Bloody Mary !!!!"}
{"text":"Spontaneous decision with my boyfriend and what a great decision! #1 breakfast sandwich with home fries was amazing and the bites I stole from my boyfriend's berry pancakes were to die for. Such a great place! Quick service, great prices, friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love a theme, some people call it a gimmick, I prefer theme :) in this day and age when it seems new restaurants are popping up every other day (definitely not complaining about that) it is nice and refreshing to have a place that you know what you're in store for. And for Bakn it's delicious, hearty, meat filled dishes. Omg that sentence just makes me hungry. Two visits to this place and a 3rd happening later today, I'm hooked. The atmosphere and decor is so fun and unexpected. So as soon as you walk in you know you're in for a treat. Then comes the food, the honey/bacon jam with biscuits is truly top notch! I still think about it!   My first visit there I went basic and had the BLT. It was so very good. I personally found it a little bland overall, but I'm convinced they do that to allow you to take in all the flavors their dishes have to offer. The salty balances with the citrus/tart etc. they're well composed dishes for sure! My second visit was for dinner so I ventured into the burgers and it was very good! Again not a ton of flavors overwhelming, but instead well balanced ones. I like French fries, but I don't like LOVE them, but theirs I inhaled.   I can't wait to go back, later today. Lol"}
{"text":"We have been here three times and each time things got a little worse. My first meal was great, got a seat pretty easily and the Bakn Bakn Bakn omelette was really good (potatoes stole the show). We then returned for a dinner. My pork belly tacos tasted great but were so fatty they made me nauseous and I couldn't keep eating. This wasn't regular pork belly fattiness but large chunks of fat.. my meat loving husband said the same for his pork belly Reuben. Returned again for brunch. Took over and hour to get seated because the hostess took the wrong number down (even after I double checked) and then when she called it and it said \"this number is not in service\" didn't check outside to see if we were waiting, just kept moving. Food came particularly slowly after that. I got the shrimp and grits this time which was quite disappointing. The shrimp was well seasoned but the grits were so bland I really had to just pick the meat out to eat. I get the hype around this place but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Updating review based on dinner experience.  Our waitress was awesome and very attentive. Drinks were COLD. Both entrees were prepared wonderfully. I was surprised to see how dead the restaurant was for a Thursday evening."}
{"text":"What a great place!  The food is really good! The service was friendly and oh the bacon options!  I really recommend this place. There are a lot of different and great items on the menu."}
{"text":"Came last night for a promotional event. The food was free and the drinks were $5.  To drink, I had the 376 standstill. The first one I got had a fly in it. After that they were fine.  To eat, there was a rotation of appetizers that were all delicious (mind you I did not try the bacon jam or pork belly sliders [vegetarian]). These included shrimp & grits, fries with blue cheese, biscuits with bacon jam, pork belly sliders, vegetable flatbread, pesto mozzarella grilled cheese, caprese flatbread, and mushroom flatbread.  Dessert was a choice of salted caramel cheesecake, chocolate hazelnut mousse, and something else I can't remember ~ each served in a small Mason jar. I got the salted caramel cheesecake, which tasted nothing like salted caramel. It was more like just cheesecake with a ton of caramel sauce and topped with whipped cream. It didn't excite me in the least and I didn't eat it past the first bite. I tried my friends choc hazelnut mousse and it was really good. Light, fluffy, and not too sweet.  What seemed odd to me is that the menu consists of 95% breakfast items, yet we were served nothing breakfast-like. Also, what we were served isn't even on the menu, so I'm not sure what the point of the tasting event was. The bartender even confirmed that the items we had aren't on the menu, and that they only serve the fries on Friday night but they don't tell anyone because they charge $10 for a small bowl of them.  It's real weird.  One thing I absolutely loved is that it had no smell of bacon. For me, that was the best, but for others, they may prefer the bacon odor."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened a few years back. A great addition to the town of Carnegie and the food has only continued to be inventive and tasty! I've been here for weekend brunch and weekend dinner. Most memorable experience would be when a group of 10 of us (including 3 small kiddos) came by for dinner - we were seated very quickly and the children were accommodated. The menu is diverse enough that anyone can find something they enjoy - many of us tried out the bacon-y menu items, but we also had a few non-bacon eaters, vegetarian, and vegan people in our party, not to mention slightly picky toddlers :) We started off with a bacon flight - which came with several types of bacon - all delicious. Many people got burgers which were all made very well, while I personally got the bacon pancakes (omg). One friend ordered the BLT which had a VERY generous bacon portion - no complaints there! They were not short on options for vegetarians (amazing looking and well received grilled cheese) and vegans (veggie sandwich looked great, as did their many salads). The little ones also enjoyed their apple pie pancakes!  The staff itself was very friendly - I'm sure we were one of the more demanding tables there - but everyone was all smiles and well fed. I've enjoyed every visit here and look forward to many more!"}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING! and completely worth any wait! Thankfully we used the Nowait app, so we walked in and were seated right away. We sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen which was very cramped, but we loved it. It was like watching a show while waiting for our meals. It was great too because we saw so many other dishes we wanted to try!   We weren't planning on an appetizer, but our server recommended the Bakn Flight which was a sampler of 6 flavors of bacon. It was incredible! There was applewood, BBQ, candied, peppered, cajun and one we can't remember. Our top favorite was the candied.   I got the chicken & cakes which was bacon stuffed pancakes with boneless chicken breasts. It was so delicious! The portions are so filling, I took half of mine home.   My husband got the Pig Pen Burger: burger, cheeses, bacon, pork belly, egg, tomato, arugula. He loved it and said it was so flavorful! The side of fries he got were even amazing.   We cannot wait to come back! I'm looking forward to trying the bacon jam and mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"they get two stars because my boyfriend liked his sandwich. thats it for the positive. we were greeted and seated by someone who said she was the general manager, but then she disappeared and we never saw her again. service was pretty terrible given how few tables our server had (2, including us). my sandwich was bland and i only ate two bites but the server never even asked if everything was ok. even worse was the \"cheese sauce\" which really was just the flavorless pasty base for what must be a very disappointing mac & cheese. bottom line is that my food was tasteless, the server couldnt possibly have missed the fact that i didnt eat any of my food but obviously didnt care, and the manager was nowhere to be found."}
{"text":"I've tried on several occasions and always hoped for more, but it really hasn't lived up.  To start, the restaurant is nice inside.  Very modern and sets itself apart.  However, the menu and service isn't what you'd hope for.  I've had breakfast, lunch, brunch and the same every time.  First off, the prices are too high.  Last trip a basic breakfast (eggs, potatoes) and a pork belly taco lunch with drinks cost $55.  The prices are just too high for the quality.  We got pork belly tacos at the urging of the waitress.  However, the pork belly was nearly all fat on every taco.  Out of 3, we only ate 1 and part of the 2nd.  Didn't even touch the 3rd.  The waitress asked if it was ok, we said it was all fat.  She said, \"sorry\" and took the full plate.  I guess she wasn't concerned.  I had the basic breakfast and it was just ok.  Nothing worth the high cost.  The potatoes were bland so those were a waste.  The waitress dropped my toast on the way over.  Again, she said sorry and took the toast away, but never brought more.  Weird?  The bloody mary's were a disappointment.  I was looking forward to the bakn bloody but again, like everything else, underwhelmed me.  The lone bright spot was the Beermosa.  Every time I've had one, they've been delicious.  However the overprice on the food and the underwhelming food leaves a lot to be desired.  It's a shame, a lot of potential here."}
{"text":"Had bacon strip appetizer, worth it for first time. i didn't have to wait at all when we went"}
{"text":"I take all out of town people here. It's delicious, fun, and typically busy. You can use the the no wait app to \"get in line\" earlier if you're worried about the wait. The bakn jam with muffins/bread is fantastic. You really cannot go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"We tried bak'n for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. The food was fresh and tasty and the menu was late enough that no matter what your in the mood for, you can find it. The breakfast menu is large with pancakes and sandwiches and daily specials. The lunch menu is just as good with sandwiches burgers pasta and salads. The great thing is, you can get all of it anytime. We had the grilled cheese, which was fresh and cheesy with a tasty pesto spread. We also had the BLT with a lb of bacon!! It was delicious! The bread was fresh and crispy and the sandwich had a bacon mayo spread which would have made a great sandwich on its own. We also has the chocolate chip pancakes which was as large as the plate and some of the best I've had! We got to sit and the bar and watched the guys make our lunch, which is always one of my favorite things. It's a great place in a very cool spot on Main Street as part of the reassurance of Carnegie."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant, fun idea, but poor execution. Potato soup was wayyy too thick...more like mashed potatoes. 1 pound of bacon on a BLT??? To me, that's just ridiculous. Maybe we just ordered the wrong items, because it was busy when we were there!"}
{"text":"Skip all the hipster breakfast spots. Come to Bakn and get great food AND great service. I had the BLT with an enormous amount of bacon. The blood mary was perfectly spicy and my fiancées bacon and egg sandwich was awesome too. Do yourself a favor and check out Bakn in Carnegie. 5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"I love this place so much.  A client introduced it to me, and now I crave bacon stuffed pancakes regularly.  It's got a wide open type ambience and is very bright.  The portion sizes are not disappointing, and the service is great.   There are two counters you can sit at, one that faces the bar, and the other faces the kitchen.  Last time I sat at the kitchen counter, my dog wouldn't leave me alone for days.   Personal favorites of mine include the Bakn-stuffed cakes, and the Salmon cous-cous.  The food so nice, they named it twice!  I've had the amazing grilled cheese flight and love to dip that in the minestrone soup.  They take AMEX which is great for business meetings.  The only downside is the metered street parking.  Make sure to bring change. Try a bacon flight.  If you dare!"}
{"text":"We loved Bakn!  We took our two kids, age 1 & 3.  They were very accommodating and even gave us a free appetizer.  (our kids were not cooperating and I think they were trying to help).  It's very family friendly. I thought the prices were fair and the food was very good. We'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"The food was good and it was busy for a Sunday, however we were seated as soon as we came in.  We got the braised short ribs with cheesy polenta with a brunch punch and the chocolate chip pancakes with a side of candid bacon and orange juice.  I will be back again."}
{"text":"Mmmmm bakn! My husband got the bakn' cake tacos and I got the chicken n' cakes. So awesome! I also got their fountain of youth drink which is sour but very good and the peach raspberry Bellini which was perfect: light, bubbly, and sweet. The only reason this restaurant didn't get a 5 star from me is because it's a little pricey for breakfast items... although they do give you HUGE servings! The atmosphere was super cute with piggy art and cute curly pig tail purse/coat hangers which I have added a picture of.   Sorry about my chicken n cakes picture, I couldn't wait to take a few bites before I took a picture...whoops!"}
{"text":"I really want this new restaurant to succeed. They seem to have act together, and people are coming in droves to see what the big deal is about.  PROS: 1. The decor is cool, urban warehouse vibe. The artwork is awesome. It was inviting and fun, not trendy or hipster, like so many new restaurants try to be... 2. The ice tea and coffee is fresh and tasty. 3. The seasonings on the French fries are quite wonderful, I think it's Rosemary... 4. You must try the bacon honey jam and biscuits. The biscuits are small, silver dollar size. A novel appetizer. 5. I counted 10 pieces of bacon on my BLT. 6. The staff was very friendly and good at their jobs.  CONS 1. A little pricey, but you are paying for quality. 2. One appetizer lets you sample BAKN's different bacons. The bacon was delicious (could have been a bit crispier). Trouble is, aside from the peppered bacon and the candied, it was hard to discern what the other types were. 3. The arugula, oh, the arugula. I hope you like a little bacon with your arugula... I ordered the bacon flatbread, which apparently means a wee bit of bacon crumbles on flavorless cheese, with a mountain of arugula on top. Same with the BLT.  Too much of this stuff, it almost makes you wonder what there are trying to compensate for or hide. This was the main negative of my visit. 4. The parking. Good luck trying to park at peak mealtimes. Or any other time.   Do not think for one minute that I will not return. The food was delicious. I want to try their breakfast offerings next time... AND THERE WILL BE A NEXT TIME!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh off of brunch from Bakn, I am ready to try more. Why? Welllll....I kind of feel like my beverages were the best part of my meal. The fresh squeezed OJ mimosa was delightful, and the coffee with fresh creamer was tasty. I ordered the Bakn, Bakn, Bakn omelette and unfortunately, I couldn't taste the three different flavored bacons at all. I was a little disappointed! The omelette itself was really good though with melty mozzarella, but the bacon wasn't really what I wanted it to be.  The atmosphere at Bakn really wins. Loved the cute little piggy decor all over, and the paint colors (I can't believe I'm talking about paint colors haha) were calming and nice. I was surprised they have a full bar, and there are tons of bar seats! Also, we had great service.   Things I'd like to try there, and I will update my review accordingly: the bakn appetizer to really try the different flavors, breakfast sandwich, bakn stuffed pancakes, pork belly tacos - the list goes on! They have happy hour specials and different specials for weeknight dining as well.   Listen, very important for dining here!!! If you don't get in on the No Wait app action, then you are going to wait, period. We walked right into our table, while others were told up to a 45 minute wait. Especially helpful I'm sure if you have a bigger party!"}
{"text":"Mixed reviews about this place. The place itself is cute, small but still a short wait time for a party of 2. We sat at the bar because that was first available and had quick service with the drinks and also the food order. I started with the Bakn Bloody Mary it was garnished with peppered bacon and also a dill pickle giving the drink a pickle flavor that was different than most but in a good way. The menu had your basic breakfast foods, omelets , 2 egg special , pancakes but also had a couple breakfast sandwiches that made them stand out from your standard diner. I had high hopes for this place and I had a good experience at first. I went with the breakfast sandwich #1 that had a fried egg, cheese, arugula, roasted tomatoes, and a bacon mayo. We also got a side of Mac n cheese and 1 pancake to try. We waited a while for our food but we had read some reviews that the food takes a while to come out so we started some conversations with others at the bar who were locals and confirmed we couldn't go wrong with anything on the menu because everything was good. The couple next to us when we first got there had left, a new couple came and then we noticed they also were done with their food but we still hadn't received ours. More orders came out and were handed to us in error (they must've figured it had to be ours because we were waiting so long). Finally the person who took our order informed us that she did not have a problem putting the order in just as we asked except she did not hit the enter button for it to actually get placed!! So that explains all these people coming and going around us yet we still had not been served. The girl that first sat us even came over and asked \"how was everything\" thinking we must've eaten and our plates were cleared but we said we wouldn't know because we still had not gotten our food. She said she would check on it but that's when our food did come out.  Not impressed with the sandwich the egg to me was overdone and when I mentioned it to the server she said typically it's over medium and she would be willing to get me a new egg but I declined because I had already waited so long the sooner I could leave the better. The rest of the food was actually very good probably one of the best Mac n cheeses I have ever had and the syrup for the pancake had very good flavor. After I was half way done with my sandwich a surprise egg showed up.. I would say they did redeem themselves by doing that but at that point I really didn't want to eat anymore and felt that I had to since they had brought me the new egg. Once we got the bill we were told our drinks were taken off for the error with the food so that was another redemption. The food was ok, nothing special that I would want to go back even if they didn't forget to put in our order. I would say over all experience was not good."}
{"text":"Went to BaKn with a friend about 2-3 months after it opened in Carnegie.  Been there 3 times since.  Service was attentive..BLT was awesome...Bacon Burger was great....Fresh squeezed O.J. was a plus.  Really nice addition to Carnegie."}
{"text":"Hey! We went in for brunch. We sat at the bar facing the chefs. It was fun to watch them work, they pretty much have it together. They are very busy on Sundays. The food was pretty good. Next time I go in I'm getting a BLT. Drinks are exceptional and full of booze, they know what they are doing behind the bar."}
{"text":"Wanted bacon, got bacon, and it was delicious, bacon-y goodness.  Went here for breakfast on a Sunday. Arrived at 9, and immediately were seated. By the time we left at 10, there were people waiting outside. My husband and I both ordered sammiches - he the 1lb bacon BLT (which he loved, and only ate half) and I, the breakfast sammich #1 (loved and only ate half) - and we split an order of the biscuits and bacon jam (5 stars, you're a fool if you don't try them). Bonus points b/c I subbed a side of fruit for the fries that came with my sammie, and they didn't up-charge for that.  Service was fantastic; our waitress and manager/owner were extremely attentive making sure to keep a constant re-fill of coffee and water.  I docked them 1 star for choice of furniture/crowdedness.  I'm a stickler for good chairs/seating and I wasn't a fan of theirs - they were just uncomfortable.  It was also a little crowded - it's a pet peeve of mine when restaurants try to fit too many tables in a small space, and you end up having to twist and weave to get out. Maybe I'm weird, idk.  In conclusion, the place is awesome and the food was delicious. I thought the prices were fair, despite some of the reviews.  I will be back, and I hope this place does well. #baconforlife"}
{"text":"This is hands down a pleasant surprise! The atmosphere, the service, the food were all spot on! The owner is very hands on, he was even sweeping the floor!  We will definitely be back!  The build your own breakfast sandwich was delicious, I would ask for double bacon next time!!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Bakn. Run, don't walk. It is that good. They are open from 8am - 10pm on Saturdays. We headed there around 11:30am - we were able to use NoWait to get line while we were driving, so the wait went pretty fast. We only had to wait 7 minutes for our table to be ready.   I literally wanted to try everything on the menu. It all sounded amazing. I started off with the Sunshine Mimosa- it was delicious.   For our entree, I ordered the Four Cheese Omelette - it comes with home fries and I got an order of applewood smoked bacon. The omelette was to die for and the bacon was perfectly crispy - just the way I like it.   We split an order of the Fresh Berry Cakes - they were amazing- fresh blueberries and strawberries and it comes it a berry syrup (you can ask for regular syrup too.)   My friend ordered the Breakfast Sandwich #1 and loved it. Her sandwich also came with home fries (btw they are out of this world)   We spent about an hour and half at Bakn & I'm ready to go back. It was constantly busy, so make sure the NoWait app to score a table."}
{"text":"I generally love this place but we went for lunch today and we somewhat disappointed.   My fav is usually the shrimp and grits. They changed the bowl that it is served in and it was much harder to eat.  Also the grits were kinda of runny and the egg was almost raw.   My Dad got a flatbread that was totally burnt on the bottom.  My daughter absolutely inhaled her bacon, so I'm guessing she thought that was good!  They were busy during lunch on Friday but I still felt we had to wait a long time to get our order placed.   I will come back because previous experiences have been good. But I was disappointed today."}
{"text":"Nice place, NoWait worked flawlessly on busy Saturday breakfast/lunch time period.  Waiter was OK, nothing special on the service side, but not bad.  Menu is nice blend of breakfast/bar food staples and of course, plenty of bacon and belly.  My family was seated at the kitchen bar and we watched the hustle bustle of the kitchen team, pretty organized and clean.  The bakn omelette was prepared with bacon bits, not chunks or thick strips/pieces, but disappointing thin extra crispy bits.  The pancakes are great and fresh squeezed OJ is a bit pricey for the serving size, but yummy.  Our burger was cooked incorrectly and promptly taken care of without much fuss.  Bread used for breakfast and sandwich's is delicious and lots of butter in use (maybe a tad to much).  I will go back, but not get bacon, i can make better bacon at home from the grocery store.  Also I watched the kitchen staff use a microwave to heat up a stuffed pepper looking dish... Overall for the price, location, food quality and service this a decent spot and i look forward to exploring more."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I really liked the bar area and the mimosas. I have had a couple of breakfast dishes and I haven't found the food to be delicious. In general, it tastes too bland for my taste. I don't come here for the bacon. I like the overall ambience and the fact that he has a lot of lighting. Because there are so many tables, they can get pretty loud during rush hours. I wish they had bottom less mimosa options. I still think it's a good experience and perhaps I will find a dish I like."}
{"text":"Bakn is a really great place to grab a sandwich. I ordered the pork belly Reuben and it was fantastic. The pork belly was fatty but not too fatty. We also tried one of their martinis with bacon in it and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! I will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Bakn yesterday and had a terrible experience. First, the woman seating people (who turned out to be the manager) attempted to seat my husband, our 6-month-old, and me at a tall cafe table intended for 2 people. While my daughter would be sitting on our laps, this tiny table left no room for us to move plates away from her or anywhere to set the diaper bag. I was met with attitude when I asked for a regular table. When we were seated at a normal table, our waitress took our order. I got a BLT with fries and my husband got a bacon omelette with fruit salad. Over 25 minutes later, our food still hadn't arrived.   A young man who was cleaning tables must've noticed my face and came over to ask if we needed anything; we explained that our food was taking forever. He said it was very busy and that things were not going well; he said that the owner is normally very involved but that he was away at this time. He said we could contact the owner with our concerns. He promised to get our waitress and to do what he could. It would turn out that this was the best customer service we'd receive.  Our waitress came over several minutes later and asked what the problem was. We again told her that our food was taking exceptionally long. She then asked us what she was supposed to do about it. She told us it was very busy. When I again expressed my frustration, she told us yelling at her wasn't going to do any good.  Then the manager came over. She told us to look around; it was clearly very busy. I told her I'd been in busy restaurants before; was I supposed to be impressed? She then repeated that they were busy and asked what she was supposed to do about it. I explained that the table next to us had received their food, eaten it, placed a to go order, received that, and paid, all while we were waiting for our food - over 30 minutes at that point. She raised her voice at me, again asking what I wanted her to do about it. I told her I'd be contacting the owner as well as posting an honest review on Yelp. She then informed me I was \"being mean\" and stormed off. I sat there in disbelief for a moment, then began gathering up my daughter's belongings with the intention of leaving. As I was standing up, our waitress walked over with two plates and snarkily asked \"Do you even still want these?\"   Well, it had been 35 minutes, and we were hungry. So we sat down and ate. The food was alright - certainly not worth the long wait that we had. The fruit salad was just pineapple and grapes, and the BLT (which was supposed to have special bacon mayo of some kind) just had plain mayo.  At some point during our meal, the waitress and manager both came over to tell us our bill had been taken care of and not to worry about it. We did not leave a tip.  The best (sarcasm) part was after I took the baby out to the car to feed her. The manager/hostess made an incredibly rude remark to my husband about me.   I will not go back. Comedically bad service plus mediocre food? No thanks."}
{"text":"We walked in here not really knowing what to expect, and we are glad we did! The experience from start to finish was incredible! We had the 1lb BLT and they aren't lying when it's legit 1lb! Made with arugula and served on sourdough bread that was crunchy and buttery. Total success.   We also had the loaded fries, salted caramel cheesecake that comes in a mason jar, and hot chocolate chip cookies! All excellent!   But the icing on the cake was our extremely friendly and thoughtful waitress...Debbie. She is a stand out and was helpful and kind the entire time.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Decent, but not as good as I expected. The service was great and the food was really good, but I expected a bit more with bacon (many more items on the menu without bacon than with and not as many inventive bacon options as some other local restaurants).   Warning that parking is difficult to find. Plan on driving around for quite a while to find a spot on the street. I saw no lots nearby that weren't private. Thank goodness we went on a Wednesday!"}
{"text":"I was searching for things to do in Pittsburgh and came across Bakn. When we got there, we were told it would be a 30-minute wait. No problem. It ended up taking less than 10! The girls seated next to us were drinking peach bellinis and they looked amazing so that's what I ordered to drink - my \"beau\" ordered a Beermosa. All of the food looked amazing as it was being delivered to people sitting around us - I decided to try the chicken n cakes - DELICIOUS. Way more than enough food for one person though, so if you're not too hungry, split it with someone or prepare to take some home. I can't remember what my bf ordered but it came with home fries that were basically the best breakfast potatoes I think we've ever had. If you're in the area, this place is a MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food how ever they were out of several dishes and felt it was slightly over priced for the not so large portions. Would be willing to try again but nothing I will be going out of my way for again."}
{"text":"Where to start, the name says it all. I highly recommend you start the meal off right with a bacon sampler... that's right you can order a bacon sampler (It's as delicious as it sounds).  I live about thirty minutes away so this is not a convenient location for me, but it is definitely worth the drive. I'm so excited to take my friends and family when they come visit from Philadelphia.  The staff is top notch, we had a fantastic server who made some great food and drink recommendations. They were very flexible and customized my order.   I wish I didn't have to drive because the bar is superb. I would LOVE to come here for drinks, they had great local spirits and a wide variety of whiskey to compliment the delicious meat. The person tending bar was skilled and precise, the cocktails looked fantastic.   I could probably write a book on how tasty the Sriracha Bacon was. I'm not even a huge Sriracha fan, but this was the standout bacon for me. There is simply nothing else like this ANYWHERE.  It was mouthwatering & had the perfect blend of spices and sauce.  My girlfriend and I both ordered breakfast foods, but the sandwiches looked delicious and portions are very large. The meal was very reasonably priced, tasted great, and left me feeling satisfied!   Hats off to the entire staff you guys rock."}
{"text":"We decided to give Bakn a try tonight and we were very disappointed.  The service was poor for what appeared not a very busy night.  For drinks we ordered ice tea which arrived without any sugar or sweetener.  After getting the waitress' attention 10 minutes later we were finally able to drink our beverages.   We ordered the bacon appetizer which was nothing special.  There was Applewood, barbecues, smoked, sweet, and siracha-flavored bacon strips.  None of them were especially tasty and I could do as much in my own kitchen.   I expected more.  After all, this was supposed to be an appetizer.  For our entrees, I ordered the 1-pound BLT with a side of coleslaw.  My wife ordered the Pork Belly Reuben sandwich with fries and we ordered a side of Mac and cheese to share.  When we received our sandwiches, the Mac and cheese was missing.  Okay, no problem, we figured that the server had he hands full and it would be here in a minute.  After a while, still no Mac and Cheese.  We figured that the waitress forgot to put that order in.  So, we get her attention and we're told \"I'll check on it.\"  Several minutes pass then she tells us it will be out in a minute.  Okay, fine but now we're chewing our ice cubes and in spite of coming to our table a few times, the waitress somehow didn't notice we needed a refill nor were we asked how our meals were.  That level of service is highly annoying to me.  I don't often drink alcoholic beverages but maybe the wait staff would have been more attentive had I been.  Anyway, about the food.  We were not impressed.  Our sandwiches were rather bland, as was the Mac and Cheese.  We split our sandwiches so my wife had half of my BLT and I half of her Reuben.  We agreed that they were not seasoned very well.  I found the Pork Belly Reuben to be particularly bad.  The meat was very tough and chewy.  For 2 Iced Teas, the appetizer, our 2 sandwiches and the sides, the bill came to $46 Dollars and change.  A little pricey for the quality of the service and food. I had hoped for more.  I am a big fan of bacon but unfortunately, we won't be going back to Bakn."}
{"text":"Great food.  Don't forget to see what the specials of the day are.  Two of us couldn't finish our meals and took half home.  Instant delicious breakfast the next day."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome and I highly recommend going. Went on a Sunday afternoon and sat at the kitchen open bar. Place was busy was service was still good. The bacon hot cakes with fried chicken is absolutely delicious. The bourbon maple syrup is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food is good.  I'd say only issue is parking and the wait on weekends.  But otherwise worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal and service in every respect. Elizabeth our waitress was fantastic! Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"So I've been here twice, and the service was consistent. Very attentive, kind staff, and ownership that seems very concerned with your satisfaction.   However, the food was not quite as consistent. The first time I went, I had a Frittata and Cajun bacon. The frittata was borderline uneatable. Crunchy on the outsides and mushy on the inside, with huge soggy pieces of mushrooms. The Cajun bacon was equally difficult to consume. It had SOOOO much seasoning that it literally hurt my tongue. The wheat bread with my frittata was good so I was able to hide a piece of bacon in there and Was able to salvage some sense of satisfaction.  My second attempt with Bakn, was much more enjoyable. After my first experience, I decided to go with a safer approach and opted for the breakfast sandwich, and it was fantastic. One of the best that I've ever had.  I'll have to give this place a few more tries, but it'll be hard to stray from the breakfast Sammy."}
{"text":"Love this place!  It's on Nowait which is a huge plus too.  I really only get one thing - the four cheese omelette, add grilled veggies.  It sounds boring but it's really good!  My husband has tried something different each time we've gone and he has liked everything.  The drinks are quite good!  My husband loves the beermosa and I just tried the Irish coffee yesterday, which was great!  Service has always been on point as well.  And of course the pig-related decor is cute!  The only downside to this place is the parking.  Although I think we finally figured that out by finding a public parking lot not too far down the street.  Can't wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"Good brunch spot! Cocktails are ehhh but they do offer a full bar. Music is a bit loud but food is piping hot and the exposed kitchen is a nice touch too!"}
{"text":"We loved it! I got the salmon frittata (which was HUGE and delicious) and he had a chicken caprese sandwich which tasted super fresh. I got the house bloody mary too, bacon picked and pepperoni garnish. Definitely worth it (:"}
{"text":"What a great concept! Everything is good with bacon, and there are lots of ways to enjoy it here! We went for brunch on a Saturday, and it was great. They have a full bar, and their house bacon Bloody Mary is worth a try. The #1 breakfast sandwich was absolutely delicious. It was fun to share along with the bakn pancakes. The coffee was excellent too. We would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great food and great cooks! I definitely recommend hanging out at the bar in the back, so you can watch the cooks prepare all the yummy food"}
{"text":"Found this place while visiting Pittsburgh with a few friends and what a find!  Loved the almond crusted french toast and my friend had the berry stuffed pancakes that were bigger than your head!  everything was delicious!  We even tried to go back on Sunday around 11am but found that you need to make reservations on their app if you don't want to wait 45 minutes...oh well.  Would definitely go back if I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"Went back to see if food had improved because our first experience was so bad. Unfortunately it has not. Hamburgers were well done and burnt. Best part of whole meal was the hamburger roll and fresh oj . Service was not good. I think they just can't handle volume."}
{"text":"Visited here before coming back to Ohio. I wish I would have known about this place sooner. Definitely my new go to for breakfast when I'm in the PGH area.   The menu is small and that works in favor if BAKN. Staff is great and prices are fair to high end, but keep in mind you're getting quality food not Denny's.   My wife got the traditional french toast & no e fries. I got the chicken & cakes (their take on chicken & waffles). The no e fries were the best I've ever had. The chicken and cakes were a home run. 3 thin bacon stuffed pancakes topped with bacon & green onion went great with the chicken & maple syrup. We each had coffee and it was just what we needed for our 3 hour drive home. The portions were a great size we keft feeling content instead of still hungry or overly full.   If you haven't been here don't delay as tables fill up fast."}
{"text":"Bak'n just opened today in Carnegie.  Just met Chef Randy.  He was so nice and walked around to everyone greeting them.  Fresh squeezed orange juice, great espresso, full bar, and extensive menu.  Open 7-10pm.   Serving cocktails all day! The food is very very good.  Try the Veal and sausage with polenta.  Excellent.    Very nice to see this place open near to home.   We now have a new destination!!"}
{"text":"OMG. Amazing. Pork belly Taco was delicious. And you have to try the fountain of youth drink. Friendly staff/chef. BBQ bacon won my vote."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit tonight.   It's a Sunday night so things are not too busy.  I had the chicken and cakes, and it was most excellant.   Looking at the menu I was offput by price, but in himdsight it was well worth it."}
{"text":"The food is indulgent and delicious. The noise level can reach unpleasant levels on the weekends during busy times. Try to go early or on off peak times for an optimal experience to indulge in some comfort food."}
{"text":"I loved coming here we sat in the back at the the back bar. We went during the Carnegie crawl the chefs were right in front of us & the head chef was so kind! He let us taste test the food. He said the shrimp was to die for and it was. If you want great service & quality food try this out. And if you're vegetarian don't be afraid!! I am pescetarian and there was veggie and pescetarian! The staff is fun we explored all the things they were making and you can tell they truly have passion!!!"}
{"text":"If I could rate this place on the blt and #1 breakfast sandwich I would give it a 5! I've been there numerous times and the best advice I can give is to make sure to go there with plenty of time to spare! Service was very friendly but definitely on the slower side. I prefer to go there on off hours. Went on a Saturday during lunch and my well done burger came out medium rare and the hash browns were cold. We got seated right away but were there for almost 1.5 hours! Just two of us!!! When the food comes out correctly and hot the pricing is unbelievable!"}
{"text":"I am giving Bakn 3 stars for two main reasons:  1) parking sucks. There are off street parking lots everywhere, but they are ALL private lots (bummer) since we went during the prime brunch hour on a a sunny Sunday, street parking was very full and I had to park about 2 blocks away.  2) my Bloody Mary was WEAK! Drinking a $9 watered down Bloody Mary with a cold piece of bacon dipped in was not how I wanted to spend my Sunday funday!  The place was PACKED, and as a first timer, I wasn't aware that I should have reserved a table using the no wait app. Once we were seated I was please to see how trendy/modern the decor was. The restaurant was very clean and I liked the open window in the kitchen to see what everyone was cooking.  The menu had a ton of different options! Burgers, salads, breakfast sandwiches, and even a few vegetarian options! I got the Bakn tacos and was very satisfied! I was looking around at all the other tables and everyone else's food looked amazing as well! Bakn is a nice addition to the Carnegie area. I'm sure I'll return, I'll just have to skip out on the Bloody Marys."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this am with my wife and youngest daughter.  Love the atmosphere - very cool place.   We were seated promptly but had a long wait for our food.  There were several other tables staring at their coffee mugs waiting for food as well.   Once the food arrived, we thoroughly enjoyed it. We had Salmon on polenta, the fritatta, basic eggs and bacon and the biscuits with bacon jam.   We will definitely come back and I have to believe that they will figure out the slow food service part over time. If you do go, just plan on being patient and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Bacon? How about a whole pound of bacon on a BLT!? How about Bacon on everything!? Got to try several small plate samples here tonight and I am a fan. Along with Bacon, there is Pork Belly (tacos, Cuban, Rueben); A variety of grilled cheese with bacon sandwiches! I tried the Jarlsberg, Cheddar, Oven Roasted Tomato, Fresh Basil Pesto, Grilled to Golden Brown. It was delicious; And Biscuits and Bakn Slapped Honey Jam! Then some sweet desserts including cheesecake (with bacon)! Yum. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Loved, loved,loved this place!!!! The service was phenomenal,  the food was good, and the drinks were fun! If you love Bacon ( and who doesn't?) then this place is definitely a must try! Can't wait for you guys to open in Wexford!!!!"}
{"text":"I feel like such a negative Nancy lately...I've been having lackluster dining experiences for a while. I'm beginning to think I'm cursed choosing to come on the wrong day at the wrong time.  But honestly, I feel like I'm justified in my recent poor ratings for these places.  Case in point...  I was excited to try Bakn, having heard of it via word of mouth and then subsequently seeing awesome Yelp reviews.  My husband and I decided to venture to Carnegie on Saturday early afternoon for brunch with our infant son.    When we arrived, we were told that there was a 15 minute wait (they use the NoWait app so consider putting your name in beforehand).  We were fine with the short wait but after 45 minutes and still not called to be seated...we were getting impatient and not to mention HUNGRY!  It was so odd because we saw people coming out and empty tables inside,  some were clean some weren't.  We also saw couples going in and not coming back out which makes me think they got seated...they did get seated, we could see them through the window.    We literally were staring inside the restaurant until the hostess came out and let us know that she's sorry for the long wait but the kitchen is backed up and she's waiting for a group to leave so that we can be seated.  Ummm...what does the kitchen being backed up have to do with getting seated?!?!  I could understand that affecting getting your food but not so much as getting seated.    Ok back to the empty tables.  There was a group that was seated near the window inside (we could see them from the outside) that had left and the table was left uncleaned for 10 minutes.  At this point, we were both getting annoyed and the baby was getting fussy...I mean it had been almost an hour.  I went inside and asked the hostess if we could sit at that table, and her response is that they just left (ummm...10 min ago) and that she needs to wait until someone cleans the table.  Well it turns out that someone was her cleaning the table 5 minutes later at which time she came to get us.  We looked over the menu and decided quickly on the slow braised short rib dish for both of us.  Waitress told us they ran out of short ribs.  Seriously!?!  It was like we couldn't get a break with this place.  Now maybe if we didn't have the most annoying wait for a table, telling us that there were no short ribs wouldn't have been a big deal but it was irritating at this point.   I ended up ordering the breakfast sandwich #1 and my husband got the basic two eggs, bacon and toast combo.  None of which was anything spectacular.   Don't get me wrong, the sandwich was decent but not good enough to make up for the horrible customer service we had just experienced.  I remember that it did have a ton of arugula in it and my husband's dish came out with what seemed like a loaf full of toast.    We won't be back.  I don't ask for special attention because we have a baby, but seriously a little consideration would have been nice when you know that we're waiting outside for an extended period of time with an infant and we were initially told there was a 15 minute wait.  Even without a baby, that's just common restaurant etiquette, or at least I thought it was.     I wish I had taken my husband's suggestion of leaving and going somewhere else when we hadn't been seated or approached after 30 minutes of waiting."}
{"text":"Bakn- I have given this establishment two different chances now to wow me. But both times have been very underrated. The food itself is fantastic but for the prices it's not that good. The service is however where they lost me. The first time was a Sunday mid afternoon and while it was steady, there was still many open tables and the wait for service shouldn't have been the way it was considering i could see my server chatting it up 3/4 of the time with her friends at a table that was sat..... The second time. A man kept coming in and out of the door asking people for money and when I approached my waitress she just kinda shrugged it off and said \"sorry for him, he does that sometimes\" well I understand another guys hustle, but I was trying to enjoy myself on an evening out and it was becoming a nuisance to keep having to tell this man no the second time after i gave him a few bucks the first. Was delicious tho and kudos to the kitchen."}
{"text":"I LOVED BAKN! I was only in Carnegie to run an errand when my husband and I stopped in for a quick bite. Now I am now I am convinced I need to drive out here again and bring the while family this time! Great atmosphere, food was fast and tasted delicious. Wonderful fresh squeezed orange juice and the best breakfast sandwiches I have had in a long time. Next time, I am bringing my mother and making it a mimosa :) xoxo"}
{"text":"Bakn is hit or miss or miss for me. Their food preparation has been inconsistent from my experiences over the past year. I've had the chicken and waffles twice so far, the first time they blew me away and the most recent I was very disappointed. Their cocktails are expensive and are just so-so. 4 stars though because when the food is good it is 5 star good."}
{"text":"A lot to like about this place but the execution was off. The server dropped one of our party's dishes on the floor by my feet (hey, accidents happen and at least it didn't get all over me) but it meant that one person at our table was left without a meal while they re-fired it (and then he tasted what another diner at our table had ordered, was unimpressed, and changed his order, which they handled graciously). My shortribs and polenta were really off. The server recognized after she served them to me that she shouldn't have brought them to the table and she offered to re-fire them (the polenta was literally the texture of cornmeal broth and the small narrow spoon they offered me gave me no way to eat it). So then two of the three of us at the table had no food and the one with the food felt rude eating so she ended up with a cold meal by the time we were all served. The staff was extremely gracious and they took 10% off our bill for the trouble (eh, not much but they really did correct every misstep). My re-fired shortribs were ok - a little tough, and the polenta was underseasoned. Everyone else thought their food was pretty good. I think I will give it another try because the intentions were all very, very good."}
{"text":"4/5 stars....Went to Bakn a few weeks ago for a yelp event and had a wonderful time. My gracious  wife invited me knowing bacon is one of my favorite foods. The atmosphere will remind you of an updated diner with a great bar. The open kitchen invites you to watch the chef and cooks in action. They put on a great show and thr team really works together.  During the event we enjoyed pork belly tacos, pumpkin biscuits with bacon jam, bacon flat bread, 3 different kinds of grilled cheeses, and cheesecake in a jar to top off the meal. Everything was delicious.   The head chef did come out to each table and talked to us about him and his wifes journey and inspiration for the resturant. Bakn is a great addition to the Pittsburgh food scene we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  Nice restaurant with a homage to all things bacon.  The Cuban sandwich was great and the cole-slaw was a nice accompaniment.  Good service an atmosphere."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Friday nights ago with my wife and another couple for dinner.  We were eagerly following the status of open tables on NoWait and were exciting to see that they were listed as come on in.  However whenever we got there we were told that we would have a maximum 45 minute wait.  From what I could tell, the issue with the no wait app was that Bakn had tables for two, so while it would have been a walk in for them, it wasn't for us.  Thankfully we only waited about 5 minutes before we were given the option of splitting a community table.  Without knowing how much longer the wait was going to be we eagerly accepted it.  The inside of bakn looks rather modern and has a well lit bar on one side of the restaurant and a number of tables on the other.  The walls are also decorated with pop art pictures of their logo, a pig.  I thought that a few of them were clever and really enjoyed them.  For dinner my wife and I decided to start off our meal with the biscuits and bakn slapped jam while I also went with a flight of bacon.  Yes you read that right, a flight of bacon.  It consisted of slices of all natural, applewood smoked, Cajun, candied and peppered.  Honestly I have never been able to compare and contrast bacon before and I found it to be rather fun. My favorite of the bunch was the peppered bacon and I also really enjoyed the candied bacon.  The biscuits with bacon slapped jam were also good with the \"jam\" being the best part.  It essentially was spreadable bacon and was amazing.  Then for my entree I ended up having the Reuben.  At Bakn it was made with house prepared pork belly pastrami, apple braised sauerkraut, applewood smoked bacon, swiss cheese and dressing all served on marble rye.  All of the components of the sandwich tasted good together and it definitely resembled a Reuben.  While the meat was also good I didn't really think that it tasted like pastrami so was a bit disappointed in that.  Overall though I ended up enjoying my entree.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I really enjoyed almost everything about bakn including the food and the space."}
{"text":"I went here with my wife and another couple on a Tuesday night.  I had heard great reviews about Bakn and the couple we wanted to meet up with lived close by Carnegie; so we decided to make a quick trip here to meet up for dinner.  We arrived around 7 PM and it was surprisingly fairly empty.  The place is decorated uniquely with a few pig paintings that are just above my level of artistic ability, a neon light of a pig, and some coat hooks in the shape of pig tails.  They had seating at tables, a bar, and in front of the open kitchen which was definitely different from anything I've ever seen.    The menu contained some absolutely amazing choices!  For an appetizer, my wife and I split a flight of bacon which included 6 different flavors of bacon.  Our two favorites were the cajun and sriracha.  They also had candied, pepper, regular, and apple wood bacon as well.  Our friends ordered the same and agreed that cajun was incredible! My wife ordered the chicken sandwich while I had the bacon blue burger.  Needless to say the portion size was very generous.   and I had fresh cut fries with my burger.  The arugula and red onion marmalade really set this sandwich apart from your traditional blue cheese bacon burger.  It is well worth a taste if you enjoy the bacon + blue cheese + burger combination!  This is a very unique place in Carnegie.  Interestingly decorated with a hipster feel and some unbeatable cuts and pairings of bacon.  Although we did not try their drink menu, it looked exceptionally interesting.  I believe they are opening a second location in Wexford which will be within a few miles of our house.  Cannot wait!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience here this morning. No wait on a busy Saturday, prompt service, & the food was delicious. I had the frittata and my mom had the salmon quinoa bowl. We both agreed they were amazing! My mom swears that my frittata was the best thing she's ever ate. The coffee was so good too! Definitely will be returning"}
{"text":"This place is nice but very overpriced. It's trying to be an upscale restaurant but it doesn't really have anything special about it. I guess if you're a foodie it would be worth trying once but not worth the repeat."}
{"text":"A friend recommended Bakn to me because of their fresh squeezed OJ mimosas - I got everything I came for and then some! The staff was overly friendly, the kitchen is SO clean, the food was wonderful, and the mimosas surely didn't disappoint! We will be back for sure! I had the #1 sandwich and my friend has the shrimp and grits - both great! But the bacon jam with biscuits was literally to die for!"}
{"text":"For someone that isn't fond of actual bacon, I had a delightful time at Bakn this past weekend! My boyfriend, Darius, and I were in search of a good brunch place that served Bloody Marys, and this spot satisfied all that we were looking for and then some. We grabbed a seat at the bar as soon as we arrived to avoid a wait for a table, and we were on our way to bacon paradise.  There's something refreshingly pleasurable about a Bloody Mary that has the right amount of horseradish and seasonings in it, and the signature Bakn Bloody Mary was alright in my book. It had a piece of peppered bacon in it, a pickle, and some bacon infused vodka. I couldn't really taste the bacon infusion, but nevertheless my craving was satisfied.   On to our meal. Breakfast and brunch are two of my favorite things, but brunch is always a tough choice. Sweet or salty is the decision that will plague me for a lifetime, and items that are both sweet AND salty make my life way easier. The day I went to Bakn I was in a salty mood, so I decided on one of the 2 breakfast sandwiches on the menu. Pictures from Yelp affected this choice if I'm being honest here. The #1 breakfast sandwich looked way too good to pass up. It came on sourdough with bacon mayo, a lot of melty Jarlsberg cheese, arugula, egg, and bacon. I got my bacon on the side and my boyfriend ate it at the speed of light. The other choice of the 2 breakfast sandwiches was a salmon sandwich, which sounded equally great but I just wasn't in a fishy kind of mood at the time. The one I got was fairly priced at $10, and it came with a big portion of home fries that allowed me to take home half of my sandwich, too.   Darius got the chicken and cakes, and honestly I was a bit disappointed in the presentation and the price. All the right flavors were there, including the 2 crispy fried chicken strips, the 3 fluffy but thin pancakes, the syrup, and last but not least the mass amount of bacon jammed between each pancake and piled up on top, too. It tasted amazing, but for $16.50 it was underwhelming. If there was another chicken strip and the pancakes were a bit bigger this would be a real winner and I'd order it every time.  Overall I do like this place. It's a neat concept and it's something that I feel like even the most nonchalant diners could get excited about. If you're looking for an outside-the-box brunch spot, head on over to Bakn!"}
{"text":"Seriously,I don't get it .....it was mediocre average everything. Service was pretty bad too. Open kitchen allows you to see right in, and I saw lots of people eating and going back to cooking. Some people had gloves some people didn't ......I was turned off.  I wanted it to be good I really did"}
{"text":"This restaurant had me at the word \"Bakn\", and I'm not someone who has a love affair with the food item.  Price: The most expensive options on the menu were the Short Braised Ribs and the Pan Seared Shrimp and Grits for $13 each.  What I Ordered: The \"Bakn, Bakn, Bakn\" Omelete for $10. My wife ordered the Bakn' Stuffed Cakes for $9.50. We also split an appetizer called the Bakn Flight for $8 (featured one piece of all 6 types of bacon they offer). My omelet was hearty, basically a calzone of mozzarella and bacon with eggs packing it all in instead of bread. This was a good thing. The Bakn' Stuffed Cakes were perfection, with the bacon pieces perfectly included in the batter of the cakes. You don't need syrup.  Portion Size: Significant! I'm the kind of person who wants to leave a restaurant feeling full, and if I need to take a box home, even better. I forced myself to finish my omelete because it would have been unforgivable not to.   Variety: Don't let the name full you, there's a good number of non-bacon food options here. Salads, sandwiches, flatbreads, omelets, a few meat options and pancakes round out the menu.  Wait Time: We were served right away, but we showed up at around 9:30 on a Saturday morning. A line quickly formed at around 10 AM, and I've had people tell me they've waited 30 minutes at some points.  Solo, Group, or Couple?: There's a bar to sit at for a quick drink, smaller tables for couples, and large tables for groups. A \"Meet-Up\" was actually taking places while we were there. Looked like they had a party of 12.  Location/Parking: On-street parking on the main street of Carnegie. Not ideal, but there is a paid parking lot a few blocks away if you're not against a 5 minute walk.  Serve Booze?: Yes. Mimosas, Bloody Marys, craft beers.  Atmosphere: Combination of rustic and industrial. The music was excellent, with some guests bobbing their heads to Queen and the Rolling Stones.  Verdict: Patrons should be arrested for eating this food. All items should be placed under glass and praised. Place this food stuff on display in a museum next to the Declaration of Independence. Nicholas Cage will steal it in National Treasure 4. Ron Swanson, if he were as real as I like to pretend he is, would relocate his office to Bakn."}
{"text":"So so.  For a place that promises bacon... They do so little with it to make it shine. And I NEVER say this but the food was grossly underseasoned (not salted). Generally bland and I didn't think anything with bacon would be. Staff was friendly and attentive though. Drinks were good. Cool vibes. Nice location. Average at best. Probably won't go back. I definitely make a better bacon at home"}
{"text":"We met friends for brunch. Would never have quested a place like this existed in Carnegie. We used Nowait so our table was waiting got us.  I had the banana pancakes. It comes in a stack of 3, and when I told the wAitress I couldn't eat all 3, she said I can get just one. Perfect. It comes with a side of chocolate syrup. Of course I had to order a side of bacon. Both were very tasty. My husband had the French toast and he said it was better then Pamela's. our friends had eggs and a grilled veggie sandwich. They both enjoyed their meal. We had a Diet Coke, but didn't drink it because it was flat. They have a big menu so there is something for everyone and it all sounds yummy. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Came to Bakn with my son for a Father/Son Brunch.  The location has no parking that I'm aware of, but we were able to find a spot on the street.  We were greeted immediately upon entering, and being we were a party of two, the hostess asked if we would mind sitting at the kitchen bar, which we agreed to.  The high granite counter looks right in at the kitchen.  The high 'bar-style' chairs are uncomfortable.   We sat down and scanned the one sided menu.  After about ten minutes, a waitress came and took our drink order, my son a lemonade ($4!?!? With NO refills?!?), me a water.  When she walked away another waitress came and asked us about drinks.   Our beverages came quickly, and that's where the experience went down hill.  After waiting 25 minutes, I flagged down a bus boy and explained it was our first time there and asked if I needed to go somewhere to order... He asked me to hang on and went towards the wait staff counter.  Five minutes later, one of the waitresses came over and offered a 'I thought she was taking care of you....'  I ordered the #1 breakfast sandwich ($10) and a side of hot sausage ($4).  My son ordered the three bacon pancakes ($10).    Again, the wait.  It was busy, and the kitchen appeared to work efficiently. After about 15 minutes we finally saw my sons pancakes get poured on the grill.  One of the line cooks looked at us and commented that we had been there for a while, and asked what we ordered...  He was the ONLY one that showed any sense of urgency.    My sandwich was served on a metal bowl, with a small Mound of  fresh hash browns.  My side sausage was on a plain saucer sized dish.  My sons pancakes were large, and on a plate with a small amount of fresh fruit, and coated in powdered sugar. 55 minutes from seated to food coming to the table.   I tried the hash browns first.  They were potato slices cut thin.  Some were under done, some dry.  They had A TON of Rosemary on them.  I ate about half and tried the sandwich.  This was the highlight of the meal.  The sourdough bread was fresh and perfectly toasted.  The bacon was complimented by roasted tomatoes, jarslburg cheese and arugula ('It's a veg-e-table.').  I ate a few bites of my sandwich and attempted to break a corner off of the sausage.  I was unable to penetrate it with my fork.  I cut it with the knife and tried a bite.  It wasn't very spicy, but it was VERY dry. Nearly inedible.  I considered sending it back when I saw how they made it... A refrigerated, fully cooked sausage patty was placed on the grill under a metal lid with a squirt of water.  I reluctantly ate it.  I looked at my son- he had cut the corner off of one of the pancakes, and was digging the bacon out of the center of the others.  I asked them how he was enjoying them.  He said they weren't good, and told me to try them.   The pancakes were chalky, tasted like they used too much Bisquick in the batter.  He ate half a pancake.  I really wanted to love Bakn.  I asked a co-worker who frequents the restaurant scene in the area.  She liked the food they got, but said the service was excruciatingly slow for them as well.    Gab n Eat, just a mile up the street remains our favorite breakfast in Carnegie.  Try there first."}
{"text":"I'd give it 4 stars for food. Menu is creative and well executed. Had a burger, and it was tasty, on a homemade looking brioche bun! Cooked just as I requested. Wife had a grilled cheese, which was good as well...the requested bacon was not on the sandwich, but they did add it quickly. Servers were good, kitchen was as I expect in a new restaurant in the first week...still finding their way...the executive chef was in the kitchen training, teaching, expediting...they will be fine I think. Great space, airy, high ceilings. I'd wait a week or so and get down there!"}
{"text":"For the morning after our wedding, this brunch was amazing! We held our line in the nowait app, so we had a quick table. The food was different and done to perfection! Try the Bakn sampler."}
{"text":"This place is definitely the Jam. Every dish is a state of bacon art Dishes taste delicious, portions are enough to get full for a big guy like me. we ordered Chili soup, chicken and biscuits and stuffed peppers. and it was delicious.  Waitress is nice and  friendly . This place very cozy, clean and interesting, always a lot of People   Randy is the Man of this place keeps this place on top in my list!  Thank Bakn for everything)"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant that has some really good food and ambience. Love the throwback industrial look and barnwood table."}
{"text":"Was here some weeks ago with family. Had my expectations high from what was being said, but was ultimately underwhelmed. Food was good, but not great. Service was just OK. We were a large group but the restaurant was not busy and service could have been better. One waiter or bus-boy simply stood near the back of the room overlooking the dinning area much of the time we were there, seemed a little odd and somewhat uncomfortable actually. Might need to go back and try it again now that we have moved to Carnegie, but I'll not make a special effort to do so."}
{"text":"Went to Bakn the other day and it was fair/average. It was crowded because it was lunch time and had to wait a few minutes (5-10) to get seated (Communal table).  As we were looking at our menus there were three people standing near the soda machine/service window and none of them took any initiative to provide the table water.  Didn't really seem very team oriented.  Gotta help each other in a busy restaurant.  Like I said, the food was fine. I had a chicken sandwich, with bacon, and it was ok. I would also expect since this had bacon on it that given the name of the restaurant that it would be great.  The bacon was average as well.   I doubt that I'd return, but usually try and give places 2 tried."}
{"text":"This is a great Breaskfast/Brunch place.  Pro's: I ordered a raspberry Bellini (it was strong) but for the price it should be. Not complaining. I prefer my drinks to be strong. This was a great environment, the workers made you feel at home. They had a good selection of music playing to keep you entertained while you wait. I ordered the breakfast tacos. ($16.00) It was amazing ! Minus the sunny side up egg (I'm not a big fan of those).   Con: the meals took a little longer to cook than I would have liked. But it wasn't unbearable. Parking was extra sucky! They are a tad bit too pricey.   But overall I liked this place."}
{"text":"Not impressed.   Service: Arrived Saturday morning around 10 a.m. We were told that it would be a 30-45 minute wait so we sat at the bar and ordered drinks. Well, it took about 15 minutes to actually get a drink (no exaggeration). Three bartenders, two of which walked around aimlessly not paying attention to anyone at the bar until finally, we interrupted one them and asked if we could order a drink.   The hostess was very polite, but she said that she couldn't seat us (even though there were plenty of open tables) because the kitchen was backed up and it would be 45 minutes to get food. We awkwardly hovered around the bar area and were finally seated at 11:40 a.m. Waitress was also very nice.  Food: Meh, it was ok! After waiting for an hour and half, we could eat just about anything. Great bacon though. As previously stated, the kitchen was backed up - though, I'm not sure I understand why?? Maybe too many cooks in the kitchen? Easily, six people standing in the kitchen area.  Sorry Bakn, we will not be returning. Nor will I recommend it."}
{"text":"Delicious food & great service. The day we visited they were taking pictures of food and gave us and other visitors samples of the food. I went home with a free BLT and fries which were given the stamp of approval by my fiancé. Will definitely visit again someday."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are always great and consistent, so you'll never be disappointed. I've had pancakes, bacon flights, eggs, sandwiches (blt!) and everything is excellent. They grow fresh herbs on their rooftop which adds that special touch of extreme freshness. All the drinks are made with freshly squeezed juices. The Bakn Martini is my absolute favorite - bacon infused vodka, butterscotch schnapps and apple juice - sounds odd but it's great if you like drinks on the sweet side. Word of advice, don't attempt to go without a reservation especially on Sundays for breakfast or brunch because it's typically an hour wait."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if we came on an off day. It was my second time there, and the first time was decidedly better, at least in my memory.   The service was not as great as I had remembered. It took a while for anyone to come help us, and the table next to us had been waiting even longer without service. The customers next to us were noticeably annoyed, and complaining loudly about the wait. Not the best way to start off!   When we ordered, I asked for no cheese on my meal (I'm lactose intolerant). The food came out with cheese, and when I reminded the waitress, she asked if it could be scraped off. As the cheese had melted, I had to say no. It was awkward.   When the correct order finally came out, I enjoyed some of the bacon dishes. Others were a bit hit and miss--for example, I had the \"famous bakn pancakes\" which were okay. The BLT however, was great, and the real winner of the dinner were the biscuits and the bacon jam.   I will potentially be back if I'm in the area to pick up some bacon jam!"}
{"text":"Made it here on a trip back home after seeing the giant bacon pancake taco on Food Network.  The smaller version (three pancake tacos) was as good as it looked.  The bacon itself was very flavorful, especially the peppered bacon.  It was lively at 9 AM on a Sunday but we got a seat right away (after hearing from someone they had been unsuccessful in getting a table multiple times - if that's still the case, the key is to go early or get the NoWait app to be put on the wait list).  However, the service was surprisingly poor.  Our waitress was all over the place (at one point she was behind the bar, making us think she was the bartender).  She failed to bring any butter or spread with the toast for my mom's breakfast (despite asking for it) and we struggled to signal a server for help.  The table next to us had a different server and seemed to receive more attention.  In fact, our coffee was served by that server and not the one who served us the rest of the meal.  I'd go back but I would hope to have a better experience service wise."}
{"text":"Always a good place for a bacon fix. Came for an early lunch. The food is always on point.  Today I had the chicken and waffles.  Highly recommend this dish.  They also offer healthy items on the menu."}
{"text":"I tried Bakn on a Friday with two others. They use the NoWait App which makes life easier. We tried the candied bacon to start. So delicious! I ordered the Pork Belly Tacos while the rest of my party got the Bakn Burger and the Pork Belly Reuben.  The Bakn Burger was the best of the three but all dishes were good. I was very impressed with the staff. Our waitress was very attentive and Chef Randy checked and chatted with us multiple times. For dessert, we had bacon, bourbon, and maple ice cream in a mason jar. It was good but the bourbon was overwhelming! Overall, I enjoyed Bakn and want to try their breakfast."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are great! The wait staff is always helpful and offer great service.  It can get a bit loud but it is because people are enjoying good food with good company! My husband says it's like a little bit of NYC in Pittsburgh. I get something new every time,  and am always impressed! If you love salads, go here! This is the best salad I have found in Pittsburgh so far! Also, try the mimosas, that is what really got me hooked on my first visit! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant if you love bacon. Went for work. The bacon sampler is worth it alone. The pork belly tacos were very yummy. If you like whiskey, the whiskey/bacon sampler is for you."}
{"text":"Holy COW! Best breakfast place I've eaten at in a long time. The avocado toast was amazing and my cappuccino was so smooth and delicious. A++++++! definitely eat here!!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place after attending a recent yelp event where I was able to try their bacon bloody mary and their bacon jam. Both of which were delicious. So naturally when one of my bacon loving best friends had a birthday we decided to check out Bakn.   We started our meal with the grilled cheese flight which included blue cheese and fig, grilled onions and cheese, and the basic one off menu. Honestly this was probably the best part of our meal. I thought all of the flavor combinations were very interesting and paired nicely together. The next best thing was probably the bacon bloody marys. As for my meal itself I got the pork belly tacos and I'm not sure how else to put this other than they were absolutely terrible. The pork had so much fat and the only thing that had any flavor was the cole slaw which was just basic cole slaw.   All in all this is one place I probably won't ever give another chance which I don't say often. I usually am willing to return and give most places another shot. While the grilled cheese and bloody mary's were delicious they are both something I can easily get elsewhere or even make myself."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited Bakn for brunch today. My friend thought ahead and checked in using the No Wait app. I highly recommend doing that as the wait was over an hour and the app got us seated soon after we arrived! Parking was limited so we both had to drive around for a bit.  As the wait time suggests, the place was packed. Our server was super friendly and helpful. We both ordered brunch drinks. My Bloody Mary was really tasty, and I was glad that it came with both a pickle and bacon! My friend and I both ordered a breakfast sandwich which came with a side of home fries. Both were very good! I especially like the home fries - chunks of potatoes with crispy outsides/soft middle. After a bloody mary - this type of home fries are my favorite brunch indulgence! We also both left with to-go boxes.   My experience here got off to a rocky start after I received unpleasant service from an employee. However, after asking for the employees name, the manager took it upon herself to inquire with the employee about what happened. The manager then came to talk to me about it/apologize. Then the employee actually came over to apologize and offered me a drink! It was really thoughtful of them to make the efforts to make my experience at Bakn better. I really appreciated the customer service I received from both the manager and the employee. My friend and I were both impressed with their efforts. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"As you can probably tell by the name, this place is all about the BACON, but it is also so much more.  Cool little place in Carnegie, I've been here for both breakfast and lunch.  The food has been good, and I really like the atmosphere.  Hope to come back some time for dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"I first encountered Bakn at a 21+ Night at the TechShop.  I sampled their biscuits with Bakn jam and fell in love.  I won a t-shirt that said, \"I Like Pig Butts and I Cannot Lie!\"   How could this place not be good?  When going for Sunday brunch, we used the No Wait app in order to get our names in with minimal wait.  Unfortunately it was not very accurate.  We were told that it would be another 30 min.  Ugh!  Okay... we'll wait.  When seated at a high top table, I thought it was just me, but everyone said their seats were uncomfortable.  Our server was nice and very busy.  He took our drink order: a Bakn bloody mary, a bellini and a mimosa... and a soda.  They were pricey and a little disappointing... my mimosa was a screwdriver with extra OJ.   For meals- some chose breakfast and others lunch.  A Reuben that was just okay and Bakn pancakes that I LOVED!  It was a mixed bag for us.  Perhaps we ordered the wrong items... except the pancakes!   Try them!  The check was too pricey, in my opinion.   Next time we'll omit the cocktails... there will be a next time though!  I want those pancakes again.  We'll see how it goes..."}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner with my husband after checking NoWait and seeing that we could get right in.  There was a good crowd but the weather kept it so there was no line.  I had the short ribs with polenta and husband had the breakfast sandwich #1.  Both were excellent and very filling.  The roasted tomato and fresh sourdough bread along with quality bacon made the sandwich better than your average sandwich.  We also tried the bacon pancake and it was amazing, so light and fluffy.    On a previous visit we tried the BLT - excellent and SO, SO full of bacon; the bacon omelette - good but not overly special however the portion is very large and toast is better than your average toast."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here. Food is so amazing. Service is excellence. You must check this out if you live in Pittsburgh. Even if you aren't close, it's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I *LOVED* this place. On a rainy Saturday morning, we were out in Mt. Lebanon anyway -- so not far -- and my kids and I decided to check Bakn out. HOLY hannah.  Right off the bat, we lucked out, as there were seats at the kitchen counter, so we didn't have to wait at all for a table. SCORE! This was an extra bonus, because we got to watch the kitchen crew in action (more than a little impressive).  Because reasons (read: I needed no reason), I got their signature bloody mary, which was SOLID awesome. It had the perfect balance of horseradish and zing -- not too spicy, but not at all bland. And it was garnished with a big ol' honkin' piece of black pepper-encrusted bacon. How could that be bad?!   One of my kids, based on Yelp reviews, got the shrimp & grits and, on her first bite, her eyes rolled back into her head. In short, she was in Heaven. The other kid got bacon (bakn)-stuffed pancakes. He was more than a little impressed with the stack of dinner plate-sized cakes, fluffy and golden, that were, as advertised, STUFFED with bacon. I opted for the porkbelly Cuban sandwich, which was to DIE for good. The accompanying slaw was OK (too mayonnaisey for me), but the sandwich was so good that the side could have been just about anything and I wouldn't have cared.  Top the great food off with a great atmosphere and staff that was bend-over-backward helpful and fun, and Bakn is a recipe for a GREAT meal. We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent! So nice to see a neighborhood I grew up next to revitalized with new businesses. The atmosphere was great the staff was so friendly. And the food was incredible. I had the Cuban and it was off the hook. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Great Gastropub in Carnegie. Starting off with an appetizer of Candied Bacon, which was 3 strips of bacon, covered with a sweet syrup, its bacon, it was good!!!  I had the Bakn Blue Burger, which is a half pound burger, topped with Peppered Bacon, Jarlsburg cheese, creamy blue cheese, blue cheese crumbles, a red onion marmalade, Arugula, which i leave off. Great burger, loved it, cooked how i wanted it. A side of seasoned fries, which were really good. My gf got the Berry pancakes, with a side of, of course, bacon. 3 big fluffy pancakes, which by themselves are just ok. BUT, stuffed with blueberries, and topped off with Blueberry syrup topping, side of whipped cream, and fresh fruit, now you have a winner!!! Great first time, looking forward to going back. Friendly wait staff!! Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"For what you pay: borderline 2 money signs $$~~~~.   Ambiance: Cool modern vibes  Service: great! Taste: Yummy  Bakn is a yummy brunch/breakfast place that puts an interesting twist on breakfast items.  I have never seen choices like this!  There is a cool, exposed ductwork modern feel that can easily turn sporty on a game day.  Most tables are adjoined to a wall long booth with chairs across from the booth seats.  One large community table near the first bar.  Other tables in the back near the second bar.    We came on a Steelers game day, and despite there being no Pittsburgh paraphernalia, it looked like a modern sports bar. It was packed full of fans! Despite significant fandom, we retained our hunger and the savory smells incentivized us to take a look around the room at other peoples food.  Permit me to give you a quick tour of the interesting foods here.   Exhibit A- Bakn Cakes:  Fluffy pancakes containing cooked bacon covered with maple syrup! Exhibit B- Chicken Cakes: Pancakes with crispy fried chicken covered in maple syrup.  Albeit, these two choices are both around 16$ and you may not find them to be worth the expenditure.  Admittedly, the ladder is more of a twist on chicken and waffles.  To be fair, I did not try any of these due to my dietary restrictions but I found it to be a beautiful presentation . The pancakes looked huge!  They took up the entire plate.   My table had the Reuben, a simple 2 eggs, and toast and lastly the vegetarian burger with a side of potatoes.  Let me just say the potatoes are delicious.  Good potatoes can sometimes make a place.  Though these potatoes don't quite subscribe to the potato hall of fame, they still are delectable. The vegetarian burger was delightedly more like a vegetarian sandwich: zucchini and onion medley on toasted bread. All was very good.  Thankful for the vegetarian/vegan shoutout on a menu that screams BACON every other option!  Mimosa's were 8$.  Coffee 2.50. Bathrooms in the back."}
{"text":"You  cant go wrong here.   Parking can be tough. The owners should be making deals with the surrounding business owners to use their empty lots on the weekends"}
{"text":"This place is awesome --they own their theme but don't allow it to limit them. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and has a very cool cafe-yet-gastropub feel.  My companion and I ordered the bacon flight as an appetizer. All of the varieties were delicious: the candied was sweet yet subtle, the peppered was spicy and earthy, and the Sriracha had the perfect kick.  As my meal I ordered the Pork Belly Cuban. I appreciated how it had all of the necessary components of a Cubano: mustard, pickles, ham, cheese, and pork. The bread could've been toasted a bit more for me to give the sandwich more structure--I took one bite and instantly lost a piece of pork belly--but overall it was a very yummy sandwich and was definitely a Cubano.  I highly recommend Bakn! Come for the bacon, stay for the atmosphere created by lots of pig paintings."}
{"text":"Just visited Bakn earlier today to meet up with a friend for lunch. She recommended it because she works close by. I had never heard of it but was overall really pleased with the food and service.   We got there around 12:30, peak lunch hour, and had to wait about 5-10 min for a table to open up, no biggie! Once seated, the server was prompt in asking for our drink orders and once they were delivered, he took our food orders. Very mindful that it's lunch and most customers at this time want quality and speed!  We both ordered the 1 lb BLT and it was unbelievable. Essentially, it's a bacon sandwich with lettuce and tomato on top. The bread was grilled perfectly and wasn't too hard of a crunch where it would scrape the roof of your mouth, instead it was crunchy but sturdy and soft.  Overall, it was a great experience and next time I'll have to try their boozy beverages like a Bloody Mary to see if that holds up. Highly recommend for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Service terrible!!! Food so so. Servers chucked dishes at you. No eye contact. 1 hr wait to be served food. Kitchen issues, 1 chef with full restaurant.. our dishes (we observed) sat for 25 minutes under lights before being brought to table. Server literally threw take out packages on the bench when we asked to get check and pack up leftovers."}
{"text":"As a non-eater of bacon, I still had a tasty experience in this cute bacon-themed place. We came for an early Sunday breakfast with some friends---including a 1-year-old---and everyone left happy. I got the pancakes without bacon stuffing. They forgot not to sprinkle my pancakes with more bacon on top, but getting it off wasn't too bad. If that makes you squirm, you might want to make it explicitly clear to the waitress that you really don't want bacon in or on your dish. Tried a biscuit, too, and was very pleasantly surprised with how good it was!   Other people enjoyed the actually bacon-stuffed pancakes and the chicken and waffles. Hot sauce available!   They had high-chairs and were very accommodating to the presence of our friends' child! Other kids were there, too. Definitely a kid-friendly place."}
{"text":"I was here for coffee and had their Mocha which was excellent but not a reason to travel beyond your local Starbucks, independent coffee house, or dunkin donuts.  Come here for gourmet bar food with a twist, friendly and social service, and excellent music in an open, clean fresh feeling environment. Don't expect to feel Andrew Carnegie's presence here but but their are some shorter, bearded Pokemon nearby.."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait for Bakn to open!  It opened and I was so excited to be there. I was really hoping to be blown away. I'm sad to say that I wasn't.  We went to lunch and only had to wait 10-15 minutes to be seated. I like that they had tables of different sizes and heights. I DIDNT LIKE the fact that they had so many tables packed in the place that you can barely move. It would help if they took out even two tables.  We were seated and felt claustrophobic.  The menu had a lot of choices. There were a couple of items that looked toting but I live breakfast foods so I ordered the Bakn Bakn Bakn omelette. Our server was extremely nice but it took a long time for us to get our food. My omelette had 3 eggs, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Peppered Bacon, Boar Bacon, and mozzarella cheese. It came with toast and thin sliced potatoes. The omelette was not nearly as large as other 3 egg omlettes I have had. With 3 types of bacon I was expecting a lot of bacon.  There was a small sprinkling of bacon on top of the omelette. There was only small bit if bacon in the omelette.  It was in the last third of the omelette.  I was hoping you would be able to taste a difference in the 3 bacons but it all tasted the same. I'm not even sure I got 3 different kinds. On the other hand, there was a lot of mozzarella cheese. The whole thing was just bland.  The potatoes were bland and toast was barely toasted.  My husband ordered the BLT. It was bacon overload. It was very tasty. The coleslaw that came as a side was also delicious.  Since my husband's food was better than mine I am hoping that other things on the menu will be better. I'll be giving Bakn a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"5 dollars for a coors light: 8 dollars for 5 small pieces  of bacon: bartender rude. ..not worth the money..VERY DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"I finally came here after months of it being on my bookmarks. On entering it was early but a slow day maybe two tables inside and two servers. We weren't greeted on entering even with a girl at the bar when walking in. After being seated we looked over the menu and honestly off the back I was disappointed with a lot of the options on the menu. Nothing here is really a true complete dish where's a platter with French toast eggs bacon home fries and so on? If you come here plan on spending a lot because everything has to be added on to the main dish. Another thing that was disappointing was they have a pancake dish with chicken well where's the waffles and chicken classic for those who don't eat pancakes? Anyways I settled for the almond crusted French toast and got the two links of spicy sausage. The French toast came out hardly warm to where the butter would not melt. The sausage was also disappointing because I asked for \"spicy\" and it barely had any kick to it it felt like the normal and spicy got mixed up. My two guest didn't seem to pleased by there meal as well. The food took forever to come out maybe 40 minuets now I understand it's not fast food but for two other tables to be eatting and be that slow it shouldn't take that long. I recommend this place for us to try and it was a big let down the bill came to almost $55 for 3 people with drinks and food and we still left hungry. I'm so disappointed in this because I was so stoked about coming. I doubt I'll ever be returning here again in the future."}
{"text":"Disappointed by the lack of flavor in the food and drinks that I had. Especially for it being as pricey as it was. The only thing that I tried that I would even consider trying again would be the biscuits and bacon honey jam appetizer."}
{"text":"I was first at Bakn for a Yelp event, and instantly fell in love with both the food and the spirit of the restaurant.  The staff really went above and beyond for the Yelp event, and I think between that and my subsequent visits it feels like I've tried every single thing on the menu.  And there hasn't been a single bad bite.    Most of the reviews seem to be from breakfast or brunch, but I love going here for dinner.  The sandwiches and burgers are packed with flavor.  If you love bacon, there are plenty of options where bacon is the star of the dish.  But they have done an excellent job of infusing bacon in creative and subtle ways that add a huge punch of flavor to give a unique spin on some standard dishes.  It's a great place to stop at for different meals and jump around the menu.  I'm typically someone who finds my 1-2 favorites at a restaurant and sticks to them, but I'm excited to try something different ever time I'm at Bakn."}
{"text":"5 Stars all the way baby! Wow. That's all I can say, I love writing good reviews because it makes me happy  We decided in Bakn kind of on a whim for a Sunday morning breakfast, they opened at 8am and we got there around 830.  Street parking looked to be the only available parking, not too familiar with the area so I'm not 100% sure. There are a couple people inside so we were lucky enough to have beat the crowd and get a table easily. By the time we left at 930am it was full so I'm glad we came early. Our waitress Michelle was terrific and it was also her bday which was neat! She guided us through the menu and let us know the popular items and what she liked. We went with the #1 Breakfast Sandwich and the Bakn Cake Tacos. OMG is all I can say. Fresh ingredients, great flavors, large portions, delicious and affordable. The breakfast sandwich was piled full of fried egg, jarlsbirg cheese, peppered bacon, arugula, oven roasted tomato (great addition!)and bakenaise on sourdough bread. It comes with a side of home fries, fries, salad or fruit. I absolutely loved it and could have easily brought home half of it with me, but was a pig and ate it all! My husband was drooling over the tacos. Said they were one of the best things he's ever eaten. All the things you'd ever want piled into one dish...pancakes, bacon, maple syrup, greens, egg and cheese. No wonder these were features on Food Network. Wow. This was an unexpected delight this morning, we will be back for sure. Plan to bring some friends with us. Bakn also offers a 15% military discount, thank you!"}
{"text":"This establishment exceeded my expectations which were very high. The food is exceptionally savory. The pork wings very meaty, tender with a tangy sauce. Also had the stuffed peppers with plentiful meaty and spicy sausage. Corncakes with with thick pork belly was great too. I could not recommend this charming and fun place and higher 5 Stars"}
{"text":"This place is great for brunch, if you can get in! I certainly think they excel in this area oppose to lunch or dinner. The bloody Mary's and mimosas are great. I have enjoyed all my hunch experiences here. I also really like the kale and quinoa salad, just a little pricey. The service here can be a little iffy, that's the only reason for the 4 stars. Great little Spot in Carnegie. I will be back and would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Adorable local spot to grab anything from brunch and mimosas to dinner and drinks. I have only been here for breakfast, but I love the blueberry pancakes, almond crusted french toast and the home fries. And of course the many different bacon offerings!"}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant. I didn't love the stuffed peppers, but I will be back to try something else."}
{"text":"Bakn is a good spot for breakfast or lunch. It's been good each time I'm visited with the exception of ordering the pork belly appetizer once and sending it back. (The waitress was nice and had an omelet made in place of this pretty quickly, so thank you, Bakn for accommodating me.) The bacon is delicious, omelets are huge and burgers are great too. They always have good music playing and the vibe is upbeat. The drink options are pretty good too. Parking can be limited to the street or blocks down in a lot. Good place that I return to often. Thanks, Bakn!"}
{"text":"Nice place with fantastic food.  I would recommend anyone go here for a casual bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Bacon Errything!!!!!   From the Bacon Martini to the Bacon Cakes Tacos ..... exceptionally delicious!   Locally sourced."}
{"text":"So, part two of my review...I did end up introducing my girls to Bakn...and once again it did not disappoint.  We waited a while to get seated but according to the girls, it was worth the wait. My youngest only wanted a bacon sandwich...I got her what I had last time which was the BLT...this time without the L and T.  My oldest got what looked to be a breakfast flat bread...looked like a breakfast pizza...it too looked great!!!   She enjoyed it and even took some home...I had the breakfast tacos...these were AMAZING!!  three pancakes shaped like taco shells, egg, bacon, arugula, cheese and a side of syrup...they were delicious We also got a couple sides of bacon...because, like me, they love their bacon.  It was a mix of the way we all like it...mostly crispy (perfection) and breakfasty with a chewiness to it (my youngest likes that).  The girls loved it and of course, it's the important thing.  When asked if they wanted to come back to Bakn, it was a resounding, YES!!!"}
{"text":"Dang, Bakn, you came out in full force last night. What a wonderful time Chris and I had eating and drinking out in Carnegie. I was really impressed by the adorable pig decor and the food was out of this world. Chris and I usually do not agree on a lot but this place was all thumbs up for us. I would say that while it is not in walking distance or as close to home as we usually venture, this place was a treat. Totally worth the time, uber, or lyft to try out something new outside of the city.   Tasty Treats: Pork Belly Tacos: Pan seared pork belly, tangy coleslaw, pickled red onion, pineapple ailoli: Ok, I will get two complaints out of the way quickly. I am a tortilla snob and would have liked a corn tortilla instead of a flour one. Chris liked the flour but he isn't as snobbish as I am. I also wished there were more red onions. But the flavor was on point. Smoky goodness and not hard to chew at all. I liked the tangy coleslaw but really didn't taste much of the aioli. I would get this again for sure.  Scratch buttermilk and pumpkin biscuits with bakn slapped honey jam: The biscuits were fluffy and moist. Biscuits can go so wrong sometimes that these were a real treat. I liked that the pumpkin was not overwhelming. But that bakn honey jam was no joke. It was more bakn than honey but still, the flavor was so good! I would have never have thought that would have been a good thing to spread on a biscuit and boy was I wrong!  Grilled Cheese: French Onion: Interesting, but eh. I would rather eat my french onion as a soup than in a grilled cheese. Apricot & Cheddar: Good! I liked the sweetness of it. But I doubt I would pick this again. Cheddar, Jarisberg, Pesto, Oven-Roasted Tomato: My favorite of all three. This was awesome. I would eat this combo every day of the week. The tomato was seasoned before it was roasted so the flavors melded together so well. YUM.  Bakn, Bakn, Bakn, flat bread: Applewood, peppered, cajun bakn, mozzarella, provolone, tomato, dressed arugula: I thought that this was good. Not my number one of the night but still good. The flat bread was nice and crispy but some of the pieces didn't have much of the bakn on it and with three different flavors of bakn you would think it would have a lot!  Graceland Grill: Candied bakn, banan, peanut butter, on grilled country bread: YES, YES, YES, YES, YES. I loved this. Peanut butter and banana THEN YOU MIX BACON INTO IT! Awesome. I would have eaten six pieces of this. Yummy!  Salted Caramel Cheesecake: No words for how delish this was. Get it, don't think about it, just do it.   From the bar: Tito's Fountain of Youth: Refreshing and not sweet at all. Surprisingly strong for a small drink!  Shiner Bock Draft: Beer! Yum! Refreshing!"}
{"text":"Dropped by for breakfast during the weekend.  Quick summary:  Modern Dining room is clean and spacious.  Service was normal and was expected.  Food wise, salmon breakfast sandwich was delicious. The braised short rib, however, was really bland and dry.  Two nice sized chunks was placed on top of another bland pool of soupy elements.  I tried adding hot sauce, salt and pepper and that did not help.  The manager was accommodating though and took it back with no issues.  The orange juice was shocking expensive for $4 so not ordering that again!  I would come back for salmon sandwich!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I would go again! My friend recommended it to me and I loved it! The waitress was good and the food was great. I had the #1 breakfast sandwich and potatoes. The potatoes had just enough rosemary on it. My friends had the bacon chicken pancakes and loved it and pork belly sandwich. Go here but use the no wait app! If you don't use the app you'll wait over an hour to sit down."}
{"text":"Another enjoyable meal.  Have found with a few visits that like every restaurant there are some items that I enjoy much more than other items. ordered the Chicken n Cake, some tasty and moist chicken with three large Bakn-stuffed cakes.  The cakes were delicious with Bakn on top as well as in the cakes.   Did I mention I loved the bakn.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, staff didn't seem particularly good at sticking with the No Wait app. Had to request coffee refills and didn't have a particularly attentive server. Food took a very long time. But it was worth the wait, excellent meal."}
{"text":"Everything was so delicious! The wait staff were very kind and accommodating. They even gave our group a plate of peanut butter toast, bananas, bacon, and powdered sugar to try after we had inquired about how it was! Definitely cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great place and good food. It's a bit pricey and no brunch mimosa special like the chains, but that's expected for local places."}
{"text":"If you have a bacon addiction, this restaurant is for you.  We came here fairly early and we had nearly the whole place to ourselves. It is a vibrant, open, and pork-tastic focused place.  Yes, I made that word up but between the decor (pigs are flying here... or at least above your head) and the vast menu of all things bacon, it seems to be fitting.  There is a lot of things on the menu... things that you may have not even dreamed in your deepest darkest carnivore dreams (pancakes filled with real bacon pieces AND bacon on top??).  YET there are more than one dish that will give a vegan a happy dish to munch and nibble on rabbit style.  I'm normally a vegetarian but certain needs need to be met and bacon & french toast was one of them.  There was no negotiation once the menu was known.  So upon our early day arrival, the smiling and pleasant waitress let us have our pick of a table and ready to pour our first cup of coffee.  She was really convincing on how good and unique their bacon focused dishes were.  I mean we could have ordered a simple cheese omelette, a chocolate chip pancake, or grilled cheese.  She recommend we pig out (ha... yea I know, you can eye roll that one) and order the Bakn Cake Tacos.  We also had to order the bacon flight (6 types of bacon) and an order of the almond crusted french toast. Great thing about this place... they delivered all the dishes quickly and they were piping hot from the kitchen.    Bacon Flight - 6 strips of different flavoured bacon for $10.  Definitely on the pricier side but who can resist a plate of bacon.  They had Smoked Applewood, Sriracha, BBQ, Cajun, Pepper, and Candied.  They all were distinctive flavours and I have to admit, some of them were very good.  I especially liked the smoked applewood as there was a definite smokey flavour and it was nice and crisp.  The Cajun was also another interesting and good bacon as it has a lot of bold spiced that complimented the bacon well.  4/5  Almond Crusted French Toast - A solid rendition of a flavourful and well done french toast.  The dish came with a generous serving of 4 fairly large slices with a lot of sliced almonds on all sides.  The custard went mostly all the way through and provided that nice and soft interior to a more crispier edge.  It did come with a bit of whip cream but between the syrup, sweet custardy interior, and powdered sugar, the whip cream was overboard.  Though ... not anywhere close to being crazy as the Bakn Cake Tacos.  4/5  Bakn Cake Tacos - The sweet waitress convinced me that this was the one to get.  Dear lawd ... what did I order?  Call me surprised when this huge platter graced the table... maybe grace is the wrong word... hogged (I know I know) the table area in front of me.  Three incredibly big pancakes infused with tons of bacon pieces was the 'taco shell' and inside the taco was MORE bacon (at least 2 slices PER taco), a whole fried egg in each taco, AND cheese.  Whaaa? Oh sure, and some pieces of green leaves to make you think its healthy.  Honestly, I was shocked at the size.  I could eat one and a bit ... it was bacon overload.  Aside from the generous portion, the flavour was good!  Adding a drizzle of the syrup made it a great sweet savoury combo.  I'm not sure if I would order it again unless I have someone to share it with... can't go hog wild on that much food!  4/5  Bakn is a solid restaurant with very good service in a nice rustic and modern space.  Definitely come to try some unique dishes that are done very well.  Trust me you won't be Boar'd with the menu... as you would with my terrible puns!"}
{"text":"I had some family in from out of town and we decided to go get Brunch here. Called ahead to ask how busy it was and the woman on the phone said, \"yeah we're busy, bye!\" And hung up the phone. I immediately turned the car around and went somewhere else. I have never eaten at Bakn and never will thanks to the woman that was so rude to me."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a wonderful breakfast at Bakn. We started our meal off with the biscuits and honey bacon jam. It is a bacon lovers crack! I had the shrimp and grits and my husband had beef short ribs. Both meals were huge portions, had a great presentation and were delicious. The service was friendly and prompt and the atmosphere very hip. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast/brunch spot. The food is always excellent as well as the drinks. It had a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Beermosa? YES! Bacon jam and fresh biscuits? YOU HAVE TO. The \"stuffed pepper\" with polenta and sausage? Pass. (Trust me on this one)  Great atmosphere, fabulous decor, pleasant staff and yummy food - I only downgraded a star because coming off of the first two tastes, my entree was a big miss. I envisioned (as described), a *stuffed pepper* of sorts but what you really get is a pile of polenta topped with a roasted pepper, a layer of sausage, a big runny egg and scallion & bacon accents. It didn't taste like anything at all and by the time the egg yolk ran its way around, it was just a mushy mess of yuck and nothing - no distinct flavors or texture.  My hubs got the pancake and I got a bite of that which was delicious so I think if you eat there, just choose to go all in with the bacon (and general breakfast) theme."}
{"text":"Love their Bloody Mary. Never knew that the crispy bacon goes so well with it instead of the celery stick!"}
{"text":"I recently went to Bakn on a double date and it was really great! My husband and I shared a flight of Bacon to start. It was really cool to taste the differences! I would definitely recommend that you start your meal this way! I ordered the short rib and polenta for my meal. I enjoyed the meat but the polenta needed more flavor, in my opinion. My husband had the cheeseburger and loved it. Our friends had the BLT, which was so stuffed with bacon that it was almost too much, and the vegetarian sandwich, which was great even for a place specializing in bacon! Because I didn't want to look like a pig in front of or friends I didn't order dessert but I wanted to! Next time for sure!  The decor was really cool inside. It was enough of the popular \"hip\" style with reclaimed wood and all that but a lot of modern American elements. I say this at a lot of places I go but to me it didn't feel like I was in a Pittsburgh restaurant. I felt like I was in a cool restaurant in New York or even London. I'd like to go back for sure!"}
{"text":"We arrived at this restaurant in Carnegie at 10 a.m. on a Sunday.  We knew it would be busy and it certainly was.  The host indicated that it would be an hour wait, and it was a little bit longer than that.  Definitely use the NoWait app to get in line before you arrive.  Once seated, the waitress was friendly and we ordered the Bak'n Flight for an appetizer.  (Can't go to a place called Bakn without trying out all the various flavors.)  I also ordered the peach bellini and saw lots of other people enjoying the mimosas, which are supposed to also be very good.  The appetizer and drinks arrived quickly.  Be careful with the appetizer, though.  The bacon tends to slide off the cutting board it is served on and we lost a strip to the floor.  We then waited over an hour for our food.  Not sure what happened.  Tables who were seated after us were done, paid their bill, and were leaving before we got our food.  I ordered the #1 breakfast sandwich and it was amazing.  I loved it and wished I lived closer to be able to enjoy it again.  The potatoes were also very good, and served so hot that I actually burned the inside of my mouth - be careful.  My daughter got the chocolate chip pancakes, which were very good.  Three pancakes makes a very large serving.  My other daughter ordered a bak'n burger since it was so close to lunch, which was uninspired and dry.  We wouldn't order the burger again.  We also got side orders of fruit, which were largely green and red grapes, with a few pieces of pineapple and blueberries.  I did not detect a sauce or sweetener on the fruit, just natural sweetness.  In total, our bill with tip came to $80, which is a bit pricey for breakfast.  It was also frustrating that we lost such a large portion of our Sunday in the Pittsburgh area waiting for a table and then waiting for food.  With that said, I haven't stopped thinking about the breakfast sandwich and am hoping to try to replicate it at home."}
{"text":"Waitress: 1st Time Debbie. 2nd Time Michelle  Music Type: Kiss I Was Made For Loving You  The first time we visited we had an amazing experience. We didnt have any change and Debbie gave us 4 quarters for the parking meter (2 hours) . It was this past Friday around 11am. The flight of bakn is definitely recommended as a appetizer, this place knows how to do bakn...period. I got the shrimp and grits and the french toast and would order both again. The shrimp are still shelled which is great aesthetically but take away from the eating experience. The grits could also be more seasoned.   The second time we went was on a sunday afternoon where it was incredibly busy. I would definitely recommend using the app \"no wait\" it put us in line at #7 before even leaving the house. I wild also advise you to seek out the host, she is positioned in such a way that you would never know she was the host and doesn't look towards the door to see if new customers are coming in and need assistance.    Our waitress this time seemed irritated that we didn't know what we wanted on her first pass so if its a busy day, study the menu and be ready to order as soon as your sat or she may leave you to think about it for 10-13 minutes. The home-fries came out relatively fast. They were not bad but they are deep fried so dont expect potatoes right off some cast iron skillet.   The beef short ribs were EXCELLENT and i see now why they dont overly season the grits, the sauce from the beef short ribs does the job they were slightly lukewarm. With the shrimp however there is no sauce which leaves them lacking. The french toast was good again, not spectacular but not bad either. Our server was lacking again and did not check on us after delivering the food until it was time to pay the bill."}
{"text":"This place is extremely overrated.  After the 1.5 hour wait on a Sunday, we we seated.  I was pretty disturbed that I wasn't able to get a drink from the bar before ordering my meal.  I was even more irritated when my drink finally showed up about 60 seconds before my meal.  Sure, the bartender might be \"new\" but a mimosa is not that difficult to make...trust me.  And the spare ribs and polenta we just  OK.  My wife liked the BLT which was packed with bacon.  If you do decide to go for brunch, try the Waffle-my daughter had one and it was tasty, but expensive."}
{"text":"Just tried to eat here. Used the nowait app. Waited for an hour in our car while we let our infant sleep since the entry is crammed and very uncomfortable to stand in. When we got inside, we were told that nowait wasn't working and we could put our name on the list and wait for ANOTHER hour.  No thank you, we will be taking it business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place had an amazing atmosphere and delicious food. We ate at the bar because all of the tables were full, and the service was great! The bartender was very nice and made our drinks very strong (the way my boyfriend and I like it). We ordered the breakfast sandwich #1, and it was amazing. We also got home fries with the sandwich and the seasoning was too good, I didn't even need  ketchup or hot sauce with them. The music was great; I'd recommend this to everyone visiting the Pittsburgh area!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to eat! It's where my boyfriend and I had our first date over a year ago. They were so gracious to turn their 1lb. BLT into a salad for me with arugula to accommodate my gluten sensitivity and now it's actually a menu item. They are almost always busy but I promise you that it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Bakn was a toughie. I went in with high expectations - the service was excellent however the food was just ok.  A friend and I arrived around 12:30pm on a Sunday - the wait was 30-40 mins. I was not successful on my phone but I'd suggest putting your names in on NoWait before arriving.  I ordered a drip coffee and breakfast sandwich #1. My friend ordered the fennel salad and a side of the applewood bacon. The coffee was great. The breakfast sandwich was alright - buttered up and rich with cheese, house mayo and bacon. However thought it could use some sort of kick - maybe a sharper or hot peppered cheese? The hash browns were ok - the crispy potato portions were too crispy/hard and overall lacked salt and were oily. My friend enjoyed her salad but she was disappointed with her side of applewood bacon (she almost ordered the bacon flight which in theory sounds amazing) - by the looks of what came to our table I would be sad too. For a place that focuses on bacon we both thought the slabs would be more of a thick cut but what appeared looked like bacon that we had microwaved ourselves - woomp woomp.  That being said I really liked our waitress - Debra! She was awesome - friendly, checked in but not too often, and even after her shift ended she told us she told the staff to check in on us. If you get Debra you will be taken care of. The hostess was also nice too.  I'm glad that Carnegie has a place like Bakn and it is reasonably priced - not including tip my meal was ~$11 and I was still full seven hours after - but I probably wouldn't return unless someone initiated."}
{"text":"Got the 1 lb BLT. I totally recommend it if you are ready to meat nap ... and I mean that in a good way."}
{"text":"The food was good.....   The prices were a little high.    We got a flight of bacon for $10 and got 5 slices.   Again, it was very good and I loved the varieties.    The other drawback was the service.   We did get seated right away, but we waited to order, then she only took the order for our apps.   Then we got that quickly, but we waited to actually order our dinner.   There was a wait for the food (but it was busy I understand)......   Then we were finished eating and waited for our bill..... And waited..... And waited........    So..... Our service wasn't great :-(......    So the food is decent, service is eh.... The atmosphere is awesome.... I loved the decor and I love the concept."}
{"text":"Love this little Carnegie gem...you really can't go wrong with a place where they serve breakfast all day! The service is friendly and laid-back, if not always the most speedy. Delightful drinks and reasonable prices. Tonight I had the #1 Breakfast Sandwich (one of the most popular things on the menu, for good reason), and my friend had the Bakn 'cakes and couldn't have been happier. I've been told I have to do brunch here...I'll be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"Very hip spot to eat breakfast or even dinner. It's obviously focused around bacon and they do a superb job."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been wanting to stop here for a long time now.  The problem is we have to drive through two tunnels to get here so it's a further drive than just going downtown.  Still we are so glad that we finally got here to try out their bacon.   We arrived here around 240pm on a Sunday afternoon.  It was busy when we first got here and we found two seats for us at the bar.  This was the end of their brunch rush for the day so it was perfect timing for us.       We were so hungry but it took us awhile to figure out what we wanted.  Do we go breakfast or lunch?  My wife eventually went with lunch and I almost did too but I was intrigued by their Bakn cake taco I had to try it out.  My wife convinced me to try something new and I'm glad that I did.  It was really good.  Just a great combination of pancake, egg, and bacon.  It hit the spot.  I needed to take a nap after it was so heavy but worth it.  My wife ordered their pork belly tacos and they were good but her tortillas came out cold which ruined the tacos for her.  That was disappointing but everything else was really good.       I wasn't in the mood for a beer and the food was heavy so I decided to get a Irish coffee that really hit the spot for me.  I loved it and my wife ordered their Bloody Mary which was really good too.       We do want to come back and try something else here.  I'd probably order a burger or a sandwich next time and maybe my wife will go breakfast.  Anyway we had a good brunch and this is as good as everybody has been saying."}
{"text":"What's Bakn? Well, it is short for the best bacon served with your meal restaurant in Carnegie. Located on East Main St, You enter and are greeted by a pleasant host who asks if you would like a table or sit at the counter and watch the chefs prepare your meal.  I opted for a table. I came shortly before the lunch hour when it was not too crowded and was able to be served right away.  They serve breakfast all day and have a full service bar close to the entrance. I opted to try lunch so I ordered a chicken sandwich which comes with your choice of either french fries, coleslaw, or small salad. I went with the coleslaw. I had my meal served on a lined pie plate. The sandwich came with arugula, oven roasted tomato, and bacon. My waitress told me that unless I wanted it there was no need for me to put a condiment on it. The chicken was full of flavor and the bacon was so crisp! I enjoyed every bite of it.  The coleslaw had cranberries and a cream sauce that added a bit of sweetness to it. Not only that my lunch was very reasonably priced. The restaurant is set up with metal chairs all around and by the time I left this place was packed!  I certainly plan to return and try out a breakfast since my waitress explained to me that one of the more popular items was the pan seared gulf shrimp with cream cheddar grits, and sunny side egg. Metered parking is outside but if you are willing to walk a few blocks down they have free parking near the Dollar Tree."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for a late dinner while driving through on our way to Virginia.  This was the nicest restaurant still open in the area near the hotel and boy am I glad that was the case.  The atmosphere is great - small, but still very open feeling with tall ceilings and an industrial feel.  The wait staff was nice and our food came out quickly.  The food was phenomenal!!!  We got bakn slammed honey with biscuits to start and I think I could have just eaten this all night - so delicious.  My husband got the grilled cheese with fries - the fries were well seasoned and the grilled cheese was tasty.  I got the panzella salad with salmon which was very flavorful (the salmon was extra good with a little more of the bakn slammed honey spread on it, couldn't let it go to waste!).  If we lived here, I would DEFINITELY be going back.  Yum."}
{"text":"Went to BAKN today for a late lunch with friends. Everything that we had was fantastic. The fig and blue cheese flatbread was superb and the bacon flight is deliciously decadent. The BLT was piled high with crispy bacon and the burgers were moist, cooked to order and yummy. The service was great and as always, Randy Tozzi, the chef/owner was checking in with customers to make sure everything was satisfactory. I've been to BAKN several times and would happily go more often if the food had no calories! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Bakin is always a good choice. Laura is a very thorough waitress, never allowing our water AND WINE glasses to empty. Tonight I am having slow braised short ribs. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Welp, that favor of BAKN didn't last long. I went here today for the 3rd time and the food was just as delicious as the other 2 times. The problem I have with trendy places is that they think it's okay to skimp on food because of the overall ambiance. I ordered their shrimp, avocado, and peach salad off the summer/seasonal menu. For $17.50, I got under-ripened avocados and...wait for it.... 3 SHRIMP. THREE. When my server came back to check on us, I kindly asked if it was possible to have at least 1-2 more shrimp and she said I would have to pay for an entire plate of them. Um, no thanks. For that price, the customer should always be right. But since they don't have an issue filling tables, it probably doesn't matter. Instead, the manager brought me an extra plate with a pile of feta, onions, and 4 puny peaches. Holy cannoli. I won't be back here unless someone else pays for my meal. If an owner (not a manager) wants to reply to this post, feel free!"}
{"text":"A very unassuming restaurant in Carnegie, if you blink you'll miss it but you definitely don't want to blink!   My friend and I visited Bakn on a Sunday morning for brunch. When I first walked in I was greeted and sat, and it was surprisingly a lot bigger than what one would think from the outside. It has such a cool vibe (as well as a great playlist!) with two big bars, one in the kitchen and one in the main room,   Service was excellent, the waitress was on point and very friendly. As well as having servers walk around to refill water and coffee, a HUGE plus when it's the morning and in need for both.   The real star here is the food. I had the breakfast sandwich #1, and my friend had the berry waffle. Both were VERY good, the baknaise sauce on my sandwich was what put it over the top for me. I would say the only downer was that my potatoes were cold... but still the taste was pretty good. There are definitely a lot more items on the menu that I'll come back to try.   Good job Bakn!"}
{"text":"I just dig this place  ! Love the almond french toast ! And the chicken and pancakes ! Small place , its awesome to watch the guys cook ! You can sit right there next to the kitchen ! Will be coming back again and again !"}
{"text":"Dear BAKN:  This is a love letter. I feel that I have to express how much joy you bring to me time and again. I feel so inspired and cared for with each bite of your BLT. Each sip of your Bloody Mary fills my insides with warmth and desire. Never have I before felt compelled to pen a love letter but, you had me at bacon. Oinkfully Yours: Karla D."}
{"text":"When we sat down at our table for brunch I was impressed with the ambiance and decor.  I like the open kitchen as well.  My only complaint was that chairs and especially the booth seats were not very comfortable with little or no back support.  Glancing at the menu I was a bit disappointed at first look at the limited options.  Full disclosure: I don't eat pork so at a restaurant named Bakn I knew  that my choices would be limited.   We ordered the frittata and the French toast.  With my first bite of the frittata I knew it was something special.  The flavors were spot on.  The potatos were also wonderful even if a bit over salted.  The greens had just the right touch of dressing.  I would order this dish over and over, it was that good.  The French toast was less exciting.  It was prepared just fine but nothing out of the ordinary.  It was served with an almond flavored syrup which tasted slightly artificial and I thought ruined the entire dish.  So net net, you should definitely give this place a try.  Order the frittata - it's delish.  A great addition to the Pittsburgh breakfast  scene in resurging Carnegie."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch a while back and didn't have a chance to review.   I ordered the bakn pork belly reuben and my husband had the pork belly tacos. Both were delicious, but I was partial to my order. I really enjoyed the way the tangy components of the sandwich helped to cut through the delicious fattiness of the pork belly. The tacos were also delicious, though I would have preferred a little more sauce to keep them nice and moist.   Service was good, but inconsistent and at times we felt like we needed to hunt down our waitress for things, but the food came out quickly and luckily we did not need a lot after the food came out, because we would have had a hard time getting help at that point.   Overall we really liked it and will be back! I definitely see a blt in our future!"}
{"text":"I am a Carnegie local, happy with the trend towards more upscale dining on main street.  We've eaten here once so far, and it was pleasant. Nice decor, not too crowded for a weekend morning, well executed food, and pleasant service.  Despite a meat-heavy menu, there were sufficient vegetarian items that we didn't have to special order anything, which we had trepidation about from the name alone.  It's nice having more nearby breakfast choices than Gab'n'eat and Original House of Pancakes, and i hope for more quality places like Bakn to open in the area."}
{"text":"I have something to admit... I'm not obsessed with bacon like everyone else is. There, I said it. But... I do love Bakn!   The Cheddar Burger is probably one of the best burgers in Pittsburgh. The meat in the patty is excellent quality, cooked perfectly. The other thing I love about Bakn is how fresh everything is. Even down to the arugula dressed on the burger. Speaking of arugula, their salads are also great. They have this house made lemon dressing that's killer. I've had both the salmon salad and salmon quinoa and again, fresh and tasty.  If I were to have my perfect meal here I'd get the burger and then the salted caramel cheesecake. Dear lord that thing is good. It comes in a huge mason jar and definitely needs to be shared! It's delicious at every layer. The whipped cream, the caramel, the cheesecake and then the homemade graham cracker crust. Hmmmmmmmm.   Recounting how many great meals I had here makes me realize I've visited quite a bit! I only had one miss, which was the pork belly reuben. The pork was pretty tough, so it was hard to chew through the whole sandwich. But everything else is so great, it was probably an off day.   Wait, can I add the bloody mary too? Because theirs is the perfect mix of spice. So maybe you'll just have to go back a couple times! Rest assured, if you love the bacon, you'll love it and if you don't, you'll be just fine!"}
{"text":"Extremely good food, great service, all around pleasant Saturday breakfast spot. I'd recommend the pancakes - probably the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is by far the coolest joint for lovers of bacon!!! Everything is so fresh and amazingly good. I dream about the #1 you need to taste it. The atmosphere and decor are spot on. My fiancé and I passed this place multiple times first time in we loved it. Since then come back for more when in the area to try something new from the menu never a bad experience. The staff and cooks are top notch!!! Thank you for building this gem in this area."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I've even brought vegan friends here who loved it. It's tasty and a true gem in the neighborhood. A must try."}
{"text":"Across from funeral home I had to visit , and looked interesting, was late at nite and we were the only couple there.  Girl that greeted us was not friendly which was sign of a bad nite.  long story short , the Tacos were terrible and served with a slab of pure fat, I guess was supposed to be bacon, but the chief must have missed it and serve an actual slab of fat, I have never had that happen in my life. The Reuben was fatty and bit dry and just not good.  I had to ask for a side pickle.  Side order of Mac and cheese was hands down, the worst I have had, bland at best.   Asked about coffee and she said could re-heat the old coffee at 15 minute wait time.  Service was not good, wait time for food was slow,  the one tasty item was the fries.  Saw all the good reviews so leaving a two star, should be one star, maybe just a bad night with a bad crew.  I left great tip cause I just felt bad.  visit was nite of  1/24/2018"}
{"text":"Myth buster! It's possible to dine in a bacon forward establishment yet not reek like the stuff when you depart! Bakn is truly a bacon sensation, but no worries...there's a plethora of non-swine (and even vegetarian) options to ponder. Their basic breakfast sandwich #1 comes with a substantial side o' delicately rosemary seasoned, roasted home fries - much appreciated in a city full of under seasoned breakfast potatoes! And then there was bacon. The bakn flight was tempting, but one can get the same effect via the 'bakn bakn bakn' omelet; cooked to perfection and filled with the applewood smoked, cajun and peppered varieties + mozzarella cheese to boot. But the true wizardry is in the bak'n slapped honey jam that I ordered on the side for the toast! It's magical and simply a must try. This Carnegie destination deserves several visits, but brunch was heavenly."}
{"text":"Almost everything was just right! Almost...  1. The space. Such a contemporary feel with subway tile and stainless steel meeting a bit of antiqued wood here and there. Unfortunately, there are too many tables, and the waitresses have to squeeze between tight spaces to get from one table to the next. We were sitting at the bar, and I had to move because the waitress kept annoyingly bumping and sliding againsty chair. It was absurd.   2. The food was exquisite in my opinion, but not my husbands. It took about 20 minutes from order to arrival. I had the short ribs breakfast, which was divine. My hubby had the Bakn cakes. He was unimpressed. I thought they were alright, but not nearly as tasty as the short ribs.   3. The service: great! Lance, the bartender was super nice and attentive.   4. The prices: a bit too pricey, but I was certainly sated.   I would love to return to try a different course."}
{"text":"The Bloody Mary Was Tops!! Yum! I Love Bloody Mary & Swear To Have Drank Some Great Ones. This One Rocked!!! Their #1 Sandwich on the Menu Was Very Good!! Hats Off To This Incredible Place! Heard Great Things & Had To Try It! You Will Wait on The Weekends But So Worth The Wait. Clean, Hip & Live Atmosphere."}
{"text":"I used to work in Carnegie, and would order lunch/dinner from various places on Main Street.  When Bakn first opened, we tried breakfast first.  Pancakes were awesome.  But I haven't been impressed with anything else.  Haven't been there in a while, so hopefully things are different.  I would try again, but wouldn't go out of my way to go to Carnegie just to go there."}
{"text":"Wow - any meal any time and it's all loaded with BACON!  What's not to love?  I had the chicken and cakes - WHOA!!!  Excellent!  Good coffee and good service!"}
{"text":"This is a one of a kind place. I love the that the menu stays the same all day. It's great for people who want breakfast for dinner. I would highly recommend the grilled chicken sandwich and the bacon jam which are both very good. My only  suggestion is adding some additional items to the menu or having a daily feature."}
{"text":"Went to Bakn for the hubby because I (brace for it) don't even like bacon. *gasps* We went for lunch and it was busy but we were able to be seated right away. There is a full bar, which surprised and made me happy all at the same time. Matt got the pig pen burger and I had the Fresh Berry Pancakes (no bacon) He really enjoyed his burger, which had pork belly, bacon, and an egg on it. I loved my pancakes because well, no bacon. We will definitely be back because the hubby wants to try a bacon flight and I would like to try some of the sandwiches. My only complaint was the wait for the food was long... really long. Close to an hour and while they were busy, the place isn't that big to have been that backed up. Oh well good overall :)"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night and surprised it wasn't packed. Had drinks, an appetizer, and dinner. Drinks were good and on the strong side. The bacon in our dishes was delicious! I do like the open area where the cooks cook in front of the patrons."}
{"text":"I had a to go order that took 15-20 minutes longer than told (felt like they forgot to ring it in).  We ordered medium burgers and got well done and our fries were half fresh half burnt. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Lunch was wonderful!  The meat was perfectly done, the fries didn't need ketchup or any condiment, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. Loved the look. Very busy but was greeted and waited on within 3 minutes. Asked for suggestions and received some suggestions. I got the BLT with fries. WOW. Had enough for dinner. Very, very good. At least 12 prices of bacon. AL Rocker from the Today Show should stop by. Zinna"}
{"text":"Delightful little cafe in downtown Carnegie. I would go back if someone else chose it but I can't say I'd suggest dining at Bakn.   Met two friends for lunch on a weekday @ 1:00 w a toddler in tow. I must say, the toddler LOVED the atmosphere at Bacn. Phil Collins playing loudly keep the toddler happy and enthused. Our toddler diner had a single plain scrambled egg. Loved it. I did raise an eyebrow at the cost of this single egg. It was about three times what we were charged for an egg while dining at the LaMont just a month age but so be it.  Our toddler diner will eat almost anything but eggs are the favorite. The egg made by Bakn received high reviews. As did almost everything our toddler sampled from the rest of our meals.   Now this is where Bacn left me feeling - eh. I ordered the Bacn grilled cheese. I asked if there was bacon on the sandwich and was told yes. I asked for it to come out on the side. When my meal arrived there was bacon on the sandwich and I was given a side of bacon. Oh well, I guess. Buuuut the sandwich, well, it was good but not fabulous. The bread couldn't maintain the integrity of the sandwich. The cheese, bacon, pesto were sliding out of the sandwich and the central bread had disintegrated into a soggy center. The edges were good. Tasty but not a \"excellent 5 stars\" lunch.  I think this meal could have been saved if the side had been a little better. I ordered fries as a treat for the kid to have a few. Huge mistake. Gross. They were overwhelmingly spiced in a way that left a film on the tongue that's indescribable (garlic?,salt?,msg?,mushroom?what is it?) and need for water. Avoid those fries.   The bacon side was good. Unnecessary, but good.   Now. Pork Belly tacos. That's a different story. They were served to our table with the salad side. Fabulous.   Pancakes = amazing.   So all in all. It was a nice lunch. Cute. Bright. Trendy. A little pricey for what's really a hip diner.Our final check was almost $60.  I'd enjoy visiting again but I won't be disappointed if I don't."}
