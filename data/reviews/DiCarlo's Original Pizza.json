{"text":"I was born and raised in the Ohio Valley, eating DiCarlo's from all different branches in the area.  When I moved to Pittsburgh I figured I would only get my favorite pizza when I visited home.  Not the case!  Pittsburgh DiCarlo's is delicious and a taste of home.  For anyone familiar with other DiCarlo's, it is the same shape (square) and sold by the slice, and has the same crunchy yet chewy crust.  The cheese is grated like the cheese at the Elm Grove DiCarlo's location in Wheeling, but the sauce is more like most of the other DiCarlo's (there's just something special about the Elm Grove sauce that hasn't been replicated in the other branches).  I'm thrilled it's up here and close to my new home, and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A franchise location is going to open in March 2017 in Washington PA,so happy watch for signs and ads going to be in town on Main St. Good for groups order as much as you like."}
{"text":"Turned on to it by a friend...I now live up the hill from it. The staff are great people and the quality of the pizza is amazing. Always get the rush hour 6 cut plain special. FYI now closed mondays. Great food."}
{"text":"Easily the most underrated pizza place in Pittsburgh (and I've tried most of the famous ones). Quality wise better than Mineo's or Badamo (and I love them both), and far far ahead of Campiti's or that sorry excuse of a ripoff Beto's. Also vastly better than the chains, Pizza Hut, Domino's etc. I'd say DiCarlo's is about equiv to Fiori's if not slightly better and should be equally famous.  Yes, I made this account to spread the word about this place, it deserves more business. No, I don't work there haha"}
{"text":"One of the happiest moments of my life began with me picking up the phone and calling the number for DiCarlo's. Someone answered and I had a brief, awkward conversation that basically went something like   'Are... are you guys really open?' 'Yep.' 'And this is DICARLO'S PIZZA, right?' 'Yep.' 'Am I dreaming?!' *click*  You see, they opened one of these portals to heaven in Cranberry a few years ago. It was love at first bite. I went there frequently and tried to recruit as many allies as I could. The insanely crunchy crust, the zippy tomato sauce, the CHEESE! The first slice of the day with completely cold, unmelted cheese was always just as good as the last one which would have melted the cheese slightly and gotten the tiniest bit less crunchy. It doesn't matter because the ingredients themselves are just tasty. But tragedy struck and Cranberry failed hard again at supporting good pizza and the store closed. I did some research online and discovered that, yes, DiCarlo's did still exist, but only in faraway lands that I would likely never travel to for pizza or any other reason.  But one day, I noticed something exhilarating. Is that a DiCarlo's location IN PITTSBURGH?! HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN HERE? I felt confused, excited, bashful, sleepy, doc, but most of all relieved. That is until I decided I would need to confirm their existence with a quick phone call. See above.  That very night, I traveled to the south hills (a rare treat...) to rekindle my love affair. I gotta say, friends, this was one of the best first bites I have ever had. Exactly as I remember it. Four slices of pepperoni pizza and an Orange Crush. This is living. And I gotta say, it feels great.  God bless you, DiCarlo's."}
{"text":"While this is a take out only place, it definitely reminds me of home. Growing up in southwestern Pennsylvania DiCarlos was one of the joints we always frequented. The pizza is just as good as it was growing up. I was able to introduce my fiance to DiCarlos. He really enjoyed it and said it was delicious except it was not hot.    The only grow I have and the reason it doesn't get 5 stars is pizza temp."}
{"text":"I usually love this place but it's gone bad. Went to one in wv the other day and it was good. I think different owners. My beef this one is the cheese. Very pour quality. Bread and sauce still good though."}
{"text":"Ohhhh when I see this place I think of my childhood, we used to stop here on the way home from CLO shows when I was younger. It's always been a favorite of my dad's and as I get older I clearly see why!!   I've always been a fan of a square, crunchy crust and this is some of the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"My family is originally from Wheeling, West Virginia, so DiCarlo's pizza has been a staple when we travel back home. I'm used to going to the buzzing place in Elm Grove, but we were in Pittsburgh so I decided to stop and try this DiCarlo's out. I was not disappointed! Although it is in a dingy area and it doesn't have as many customers as Elm Grove does, the pizza is still the same. I actually think the crust is a little crunchier here and I LOVED that! This was a perfect lunch stop to fill my stomach up with some unforgettable pizza!"}
{"text":"DiCarlos is in my opinion THE BEST pizza in the Pittsburgh area. My boyfriend and I will only order DiCarlos if we are in a pizza mood. It's different from your traditional pizza that they only cook the crust with the sauce, all the other toppings are added after it comes out of the oven. The cheese is all melty on the top and it's yum yum delicious! You have to try it. The only other pizza joint that I can think of that is anything similar is Beto's over on Banksville Road in Dormont (or Greentree, where's the line?)  This is take out only. No eating there guys. Also, there's not really a \"small\" option and all of their pizza's are square. If that's a problem, find another pizza joint!  I believe they sell calzones and a few other things, but we always go for the pizza."}
{"text":"Maybe I just had a bad day.  This was THE WORST \"pizza\" I've ever had.  I have had Original DiCarlo's in Wheeling, WV in several locations.  This is not even worthy of the name.  I got 3 extra cheese.  First off, the pizza was basically glued to the wax paper.  The crust was unevenly cooked.  First bite the crust was almost raw, dense, and way too chewy.  The sauce tasted sour and the cheese (shredded, not dices provolone like the Original) was slimy.  My second bite, the crust was burned, tasted burned, but at least it was crunchy.  There was no third bite.  The remaining slices got tossed in the garbage.  This was by far the worst \"pizza\" I've ever had."}
{"text":"Note #1-This place is strictly TAKEOUT ONLY. There is no dine-in, no delivery.   Note #2-Their menu only consists of square pizzas( 6 different combos including white pizza), calzones, pepperoni rolls, and breadsticks. This location has no wings, hoagies, or anything else.   This has been a lost pizza parlor to me for many years as it lies on a stretch of road I rarely find myself on these days. I used to forget the name of it but knew there was a pizza place here...somewhere. I had a heckuva time trying to research the name, but after trying many different variations, I came upon DiCarlo's. In finding the name, I also discovered that they are a chain with a baker's dozen of locations throughout Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio and have been in business since 1949!  Hmmm.   DiCarlo's puports to make a pizza that is \"indescribable.\" As someone who aspires to write, I shall accept the challenge.   In watching the pizza beig made as I waited, I can say that it's a pretty spiffy looking pie, like a picture framing some sort of modern art piece made of pepperoni, mushroom, sauce, and a little cheese. That's until they pile even more cheese and pep on top of the pizza right before boxing it up. Looking for a meaning? It means \"bloody well good muthaf**er!.\" That's what the artists were trying to convey. :D    So yeah, this is similar to a Beto's pizza with the unbaked cheese compounding the toppings that are already on it.    Another interesting thing about DiCarlo's pizza is that they use provolone instead of mozzarella, and it works exquisitely. The pepperoni is smoked, tender, fresh, and the mushrooms are finely cured. The sauce has a citrusy flavor to me. But that crust...  I could eat that golden, buttery, crispy crust alone, naked. The crust I mean, not me. Well, you know what? I would eat this crust in the nude! It's that good.  The crust was so good, I was thankful for how it extended beyond the pie, again, framing the whole thing and giving me the chance to taste the crust by itself.    Btw, that cheese was melted perfectly when we got it home, and like a Beto's, you can always pop it in the oven if the unmelted cheese is just too far out for ya. I kind of dig it as is though.   Take Beto's pizza and mash it up with DeMino's in Brookline, and you'll have a DiCarlo's pizza.  And it doesn't taste like it came from a chain either."}
