{"text":"One of the best Viet joints in the city. The Satay Beef was one of my favourites.
The place was homey and a little run down but nonetheless a great place to dine. They just recently closed, I will miss this place."}
{"text":"Sorry I do hate to tarnish small businesses, but they don't even seem like they're trying. The food was okay, but definitely sub par to other Vietnamese restaurants available in the area. The place is so drab and dreary. Dark, dingy, doesn't seem clean. Bugs flew around me. Sticky tables, lack of lighting, lack of staff. And the fact that the place is so dead makes me concerned the food can't be fresh either. The food was 3/5 and ambiance gets 0/5. This is the last place I would go to eat."}
{"text":"It's been about 3 or 4 years since I've been here, so please excuse any discrepancies. Kiem-Bo has a lunch special you wouldnt  believe. A bowl of vermicelli with grilled pork, wonton soup and tea for $4.50- tax included. Sure Kiem-Bo is a dark, charmless place with christmas decorations up year-round. But the food is good and that's all that matters. Ignore the inevitable tummy ache and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good place for pho, one of the better ones I've been to.  The place doesn't have a great ambiance, but the food definitely makes it worth coming here."}
