{"text":"3 stars for cheapness. It's what it is, a local spot that opens late, any budget can afford to be feed and they deliver. 

I'm afraid to say tonight is one of those nights"}
{"text":"For $2.75, tax included, I can get a slice of pepperoni pizza which is thick and very filling. It isn't gourmet but it is excellent value."}
{"text":"It's an okay store, I go to the school right in front of it. It's a pretty nasty store with okay fries and an okay poutine, but their pizza is extremely oily and nasty. Plus it doesn't help that the main lady at the front, sneezes on your food 24/7. 

NEVER COMING BACK HERE ITS DISGUSTING"}
{"text":"Their pizza isn't the greatest but their wings sure are! Their fries are also great. They have great deals and are extremely affordable. Four stars for affordability and classic wings."}
{"text":"You can't beat the affordability at this place. They have great wings they're nice and sauce and taste great, for the amount you get it's totally worth it. It's a hole in the wall but you can't really complain"}
{"text":"The pizza is comically bad.  Hilariously, amazingly bad.  I recommend getting it, just so you can say you've had the worst.  The cheapest pepperoni, cheese and dough they could possibly find.  Abhorrent. 

The reasons this place gets three stars from me are the wings and the poutine.  The wings are as good as anywhere else, but cost less than five bucks for ten (plus fries!).  The poutine is not authentic (not curds), but is huge and only two dollars and fifty cents.

If you're broke and crave junk food you need to know about this place."}
