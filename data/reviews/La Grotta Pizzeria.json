{"text":"I love La Grotta

We always get delivery and the food is terrific and fresh. The panzerotti are so good and their pastas are some of the best Ive had. Decent prices and portions + friendly service"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza from La Grotta for the first time this past weekend. We were so impressed!
We got 2 smalls so we can sample more than one flavour: 1) sausage with olives and 2) roasted red peppers and feta. 
The crust was thin and the toppings were delicious. Not greasy in any way. (well the sausage abit).
My kids do not like chain pizza or frozen pizza but before I noticed they had eaten up half of what was on their plate!

Will always order pizza from them now on - support local!
I'll try a pasta next time too."}
{"text":"My grandmother and I just finished having lunch there and I couldn't be more disappointed in the service. When we got there we sat down at the table, waited a few minutes to get a glass of water dropped off, and then waiting a few more minutes for the guy to bring us menus. We were looking at the menus for about five minutes when the guy comes back and gives us their takeout menu as well. We already knew what we wanted though and we waited to order but the guy didn't come back to the table until I had to call him over from the table. After we placed our order my grandma spilt some of her water and the guy just watched us clean it up ourselves and didn't offer extra napkins, take away the dirty napkins, or offer more water. 
     Once we got our food, the guy left and the whole time we were eating I could hear him in the back playing candy crush or something on his phone. The playlist that was going in the yesterday had also ended so all we had to listen to was him playing on his phone. When we were finished eating we were awkwardly sitting there watching for him to come back but I ended up having to get up and walk to the back of the restaurant to find the guy and I found him sitting in the hall on his phone. The food was pretty good and you get generous portions but the terrible service was hard to ignore."}
{"text":"We were in here a few months ago as my grandmother was visiting and she LOVES Italian food. We figured we'd give this small family business a try. 

It was simply excellent. The decor is casual but lovely, almost feels like a true Italian restaurant that you'd find in a small town in Italy. All of the food was wonderful. We each had a different pasta and everyone enjoyed their meal. Staff were very friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was really great (it's quieter, so if you're in the mood for a place where you can really chat and relax, it's a great pick). 

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have ordered or picked up from La Grotta 4 or 5 times.  The pizza is always very good, cooked perfectly and very tasty so no complaints there.  I have also had a chicken parm sandwich that was excellent so based on those experience I would give 4 stars.  However...

Last night my wife and I were in the mood for pasta and with the heat neither of us felt like standing over a stove.  I recalled that La Grotta had an extensive pasta menu and based on my previous experience I was excited for the food to arrive.

We ordered one \"Chef's favorite\" which is a penne with sausage, garlic, olive oil and spinach.  It made my wife's stomach rather upset although she said it tasted ok.  We also ordered a small pepperoni pizza (just because) and it was perfect.  Lastly, I had a hankering for lasagna.  I figured we would have lots of leftovers (and we did) which is why we ordered that much food for two.  

VERY sad to report that the lasagna was probably the worst I have ever had.  I suspect they prepare a batch, portion it out in the foil take-out bowls and then freeze it.  I almost couldn't tell where the noodles were because the colour had taken on a greyish colour similar to the ground beef.  The texture was tough to put in my mouth once I had one bite.  The colour of the meat pasta sauce was a nice bright red so I assume they add a few scoops of this before putting it in the oven.  It was so over-salted that I needed two glasses of water just to feel a bit better.  I had four bites and could do nothing more.  The leftovers sit in my friidge untouched waiting for me to take mercy and add to the garbage.  It was really really awful.

So, a place that CAN get it right when making something fresh to order really needs to take a look at their practice of passing along frozen food.  I understand that they might not be able to make a fresh lasagna everyday but if that's the case then reduce the menu and maybe have couple \"pastas of the day\" available.  Don't make customers pay for frozen food, we can get that anywhere.  

I'm giving 2 stars because of previous positive experiences but I will not be ordering pasta here again.  I will probably order sandwiches or pizza in the future."}
{"text":"My husband and I were excited to try some fresh Italian food,  we were disappointed. My fusilli pasta was not desirable .. I had two pieces of chicken and the vegetables seemed to be from frozen and not a lot of flavour,  also our expensive tiger shrimps were way to over cooked although the sauce they were in was yummy.  Otherwise the food came quick and hot."}
{"text":"We ordered La Grotta's pizza tonight for the first time.  It arrived quick and hot.

It's a thin-ish crust, and is better than the chain pizza places, but not as good as the top \"gourmet\" versions.  It's also a tad pricey ($29 for a large, 3-topping pie and a small salad.

They have a full Italian menu, available to dine in, take out or have delivered.  They have an on-line ordering system, but only pre-designed gourmet pizzas are available this way.  I you want to \"build your own\", you'll want to give them a call."}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant is VERY disappointing.
We had pasta and a pizza and both were terrible.
Pasta sauce was fat and not good, the pizza was oily and looked like a frozen one from the supermarket.
The restaurant itself is very kitch with old fashion Italian souvenirs.
If you want a good Italian restaurant, I would definitely recommend to go south on the Danforth to Libretto or Il Formello."}
{"text":"Can I have a block of cheese with a side of pizza? This pizza was not great...way to much cheese, too much sauce and soggy."}
{"text":"Received a flyer in the mail from La Grotta Pizzeria and decided to order one of their pies.

Initial phone call went smooth as silk: Talked to one of the owners (man) who was very plesant on the phone, and was told that because I was in such close proximity to the restaurant the pizza would be there in about 20-30 min.

After about 45 min of waiting, I decided to call back just to see if everything was still alright and I spoke to the other owner (woman) who told me my pizza would be there (and I quote) \"very soon\".

I waited 20 min before I decided to call back, really trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I was getting a bit irritated. Spoke again to the male owner, who told me, that the delivery driver was on his way and offered to slash 20% off of my next order for the delay. I thanked him and hung up the phone feeling good.

Flash forward 15 minutes, the delivery driver arrives. I paid for the pizza in cash, and included a tip for the driver. Brought in the pie, put it on the table and opened up the box. I really wish I would have taken a photo to share in this review, but I will do my best to describe what I saw: the entire pizza was crushed to one side of the box in a pile. It looked as though the pizza was boxed and then placed vertically for the drive to my house. I was FURIOUS, especially because I had waited an hour and a half for this (including tip) $40 mess.

I called back immediately and the (female) owner answered. I tried to explain that the pizza I received was ruined, but there was a language barrier which made it very difficult for me to commuicate the actual problem, as she kept misunderstanding my complaint as being that I was sent the wrong pizza. After finally getting my point across, she said she would send the driver to come over with a refund.

(With a hungry family by my side, we opted to order from a different pizza company at this time)

20 minutes went by and no one had showed up, so I decided to call back. This time I spoke to the (male) owner. When I asked if the delivery driver was on his way with the refund, he cut me off asking if I could just keep the pizza, saying his wife told him that they had sent us the wrong order. I then explained the situation to him, and asked to be refunded. He refused and said that they did not give refunds, and that instead he would remake the pizza. I explained to him that I was not willing to wait another hour and a half, and that I had already taken my business elsewhere. I also brought up that I was told I'd be refunded by the other person I had talked to. The owner then put me on \"hold\" (aka put the phone down) and argued with his wife in another language (not Italian, by the way) and told me he would call me back \"in 5 minutes\".

I called him back after 7 min had passed, and was greeted with him telling me he would give me the refund but that it would come out of the delivery driver's pocket. Exhausted from the run around, I told him I was fine with that. He then put me on \"hold\" again, but this time I had the pleasure of hearing him BERATE the delivery driver, and when he picked back up told me to \"never call [there] again\"

Want to guess what happened next? No one showed up with the refund, so I called back. This time the phone was picked up and immediately hung up. So I persisted in calling back serveral more times with the same result. The competing pizza company arrived with their food at this time.

Getting my shoes on to drive over and get my refund, the delivery driver was at the door with my refund, and apologised profusely. 

In all my years of ordering food I have never recieved such horrible customer service. For all I know, their pizza is amazing. I have no intention of finding out one way or the other."}
{"text":"This is a delicious family pizzaria and pasta restaurant and I highly recommend it. They use the freshest ingredients and have an extensive menu. If you live in East York, you can dine in but many people order delivery. Recently, I organized a dinner party for a group of 20 adults and 5 kids (all neighbours) and we held the party at La Grotta. Together with the co-owner and hostess (Joanne), we put together a great menu and they even made a custom pizza for us with our favourite ingredients! The corkage fee was low and the service friendly and accommodating. All told, it was a very economical and delicious experience. I highly recommend La Grotta!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from the take out menu online. Gotta give them credit, cause the food was very good. My daughter who is picky loved her pasta. My La Grotta pasta was so good I've been thinking of it since. 
I would like to try dinning in there since I live close and like to support local restaurants."}
{"text":"Even though I detest \"junk mail\", I couldn't help but open up La Grotta's delivery menu which frequently finds itself in my mailbox. 

On one particularly baby-dominated day where I was really tired and underfed, we make a snap decision to order from La Grotta. When we order, it's usually chicken prepared in the Swiss manner (Swiss Chalet) or Pizza Pizza. Cause you can't really go wrong with either, really. 

But La Grotta did not disappoint. We used \"Just Eat Canada\" to make the order and everything (3 pasta dishes, 3 salads, garlic bread) arrived quickly, hot and delicious! 

I was really impressed and will definitely order from them again. Plus, they're a local indie business and I like that."}
{"text":"Cute little place with friendly service. Have been a couple times and the food has been amazing!"}
{"text":"The pizzas were not the best we ate! Fat,stuffy, not enough sauce and to much dough. 
Service could be better. The owner just stay on her seat playing with phone. It was the desert in the restaurant and it still since we pass in front of it every week! 

Once is enough."}
{"text":"This review is mainly based on my experience for food delivery. 

I started to love this place the first time I tried their pizza delivery.  The pizza is made thin crust.  However, the crust stays crispy every time when they are delivered.  There are a lot of choices to choose from the menu.  

All my colleagues including myself were shocked how good and delicious the pizza was.  None of the franchised pizza can compare!

I tried their pasta and salad as well.  They were as good as the pizza.  

If you have 4 or more people, their combo specials are of very good value.

They offer free delivery within their local area when you place only a minimum order of $18.  Orders can be placed online or by phone.  They accept both cash and credit card.  I also love how easy their online order is.

Their service is fast and good.  I have no complaint so far.  I highly recommend this place !"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a decent pizza delivery in the east end since FOREVER.
This place has hit the mark the closest. I would recommend they find another source for their pepperoni. It's their only flaw, VERY salty. That's usually a sign of too much nitrate."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I have been there 3 times since I have moved to East York. The food is outstanding and the service is fantastic."}
{"text":"I can't say I've ventured much on the menu but my personal favourite is the Pape Special pizza, 97% it's been prefect, free delivery close to the area for over $20. I've ordered many times and been quite happy.
Not sure about the rest of the menu, but this pizza is great!"}
