{"text":"Bombay Wrap is unique to Crepe delicious and not to be missed. The dessert crepes are good too. Cajun fries are a little too salty for my taste."}
{"text":"After traveling so much I decided to come spend a week with my son and we ended up choosing Crepe Delicious for lunch. I have to say, going during the lunch rush was probably not the best idea. We had time, so we decided to wait in line anyway, which literally took 20 minutes. I wasn't too overwhelmed because we are only human and the cashier seemed to be moving as fast as she could. I ordered the Chicken Bombay Burrito with bombay fries and a drink. My total was over $10, which was not too bad considering the amount of food I ended up getting. I do think it is expensive for a student, though.   After I ordered I was told to wait on the other side until my order came out. My son and I both stood there, we were quite hungry at this point. I observed as the cook, there was only one, prepared the food. The cook seemed really tired and stressed out, but he was still moving quickly trying his best to finish every order promptly. What really bothered me was when a man with glasses came over to the cook and began to argue with him. I honestly felt really bad for the cook because he was already working alone, which has to be tough because there was a fairly big crowd waiting to pick up their food. The man with glasses, which was clearly the person in authority, scratched his head right in front of the grill. He then began to put fries without ever washing his hands or putting gloves on. He also walked over to the young lady at the register and asked her to serve the beverages and make some fries. I clearly saw when the cashier tried to put some gloves on to make the fries and the man with glasses told her NOT TO PUT ANY GLOVES ON.   A this point, we had been waiting for a total of 35 minutes and seeing everything that was going on I felt really disturbed. I think the man with glasses, who turned out to be the OWNER, has no respect for his employes, nor his establishment. He had a strong Indian accent which led me to believe that he is not originally from this country. He clearly does not know the rules and regulations that come along with owning a business. As a parent, I am shocked that the university allows this place to be open with this kind of service and if I knew were I could file a complaint against everything I saw, then I would totally do it. There is no customer service and although the food was good, I will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"The Italian beef is not Italian beef.  I noticed the beef was pulled from the fridge and reheated on the grill.  Didn't even notice if there was any juice to be had on my sandwich, certainly didn't appear to be any.  I decided to forgo the Mozzarella (who gets that in Chitown?) and that should have been my first sign that eating here was going to be nothing but a passing fancy.  I needed to kick it up a notch, so after some discussion, the giardiniera was said to be mild, not hot, so I added jalapenos (thank God I did)... because the giardiniera isn't even giardiniera.  It's cut up bell peppers with a bit of carrot thrown in.  [Where's the oil or the peppers you ask? I have no idea.  They're not here.]  For all those who are raving about the fries- frozen shoe-string fries aren't the pinnacle of fries for me by a long shot.  [If you're the same, avoid this place.]  There is one golden thread here- they have free tea and coffee for customers.  That's a nice change from the $1.50-$3.00 other places charge for heating up some water and putting a grocery-store-tea-bag in it.  So, kudos on the free tea.  I wish the food had been worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Dear Crepe De Licious,  This is why I am never returning 1. I paid 7.95 for a veggie crepe. 7.95!!! 2. You tried to cheap out on me by giving me button mushrooms when the menu says portobello 3. You gave me cheddar instead of mozzarella 4. The entire bottom of the wrap was open because you don't know how to fold. I mean, 2.5\" opening at the bottom. SURPRISE LAP! 5. Your lettuce was wilting and browing, causing gagging during eating 6. When I corrected your mushroom mistake, you picked a few of the cheapies off, and replaced with a *few* portobello 7. If the owner/manager thinks the girls add too many toppings, she will pick them off infront of you 8. You pre-make the crepes despite the fact you never have more than a 2 or 3 person line. I mean, when I thought crepe for lunch, I definitely didn't plan on it being fresh!"}
{"text":"You would think that a place which specializes in crepes would actually make their own crepes, rather than warm up some pre-made ones, but such is not the case for Crepe De Licious. The restaurant's namesake crepes have the typical pre-made gummy texture and lack the thin crispiness you find in a good crepe. I got the tutti frutti crepe which has nutella, bananas and strawberries inside. I got so sick of the chewy texture that I just ate the inside and left the crepe. Basically, the crepes here are equivalent to the crepes one would have in a high school french class.   The reason I gave this place two stars is that their fries are actually pretty good, though you have to suffer through a long wait for them, so they aren't the best snack to grab in between classes."}
{"text":"With the turnaround in the Union Cafeteria being pretty rapid, I am shocked that this place is still here and I'm just WAITING to see it go out of business. Their business model, from what I can tell, consists of serving extremely mediocre food at a snails pace, in an environment where a very quick pace is expected.   I waited in line for 25 minutes while they called the numbers of people 5 or 7 places BEHIND me in line, and I did not have an unusual order, I had a CREPE for criminy's sake. Working myself at a restaurant where urgency is important, I was pretty horrified to watch the staff slumber sluggishly around the kitchen and go in no particular order whatsoever. And the crepe was gross. Never again."}
{"text":"We stumbled by this stand looking for the sandwich shop.  So glad I stopped and ate here instead!  The Chicken Cesar crepe was extremely fresh, and gigantic.  Although it might be pricey, it tasted absolutely fantastic.  And, they were doing buy 1 get 1 free wraps, so we also got 2 tuna wraps for $2."}
{"text":"worst service ever. Be sure to avoid if you find a woman serving you or you will regret. I have had lunch there and the food are good though you need to wait a while. I'm not a sexist but  that woman does not know how to do her job. Completely forgot her customer and talked on the phone. So I will ignore this restaurant and go to chickfila. Their food are much better."}
{"text":"I thought that the crepes were too sweet tasting for the savory crepe I had. They said it came with pesto sauce which was really just a caesar dressing or something - it did not taste like pesto at all."}
{"text":"So, out of finals desperation, I needed some high-sodium comfort food. Unfortunately, Rice Garden, my preferred purveyor of fried goodness was closed, so I settled for a bacon cheeseburger and cajun fries at Crepe de Licious. That was actually pretty good, and the shoestring fries really hit the spot.   That being said, the word \"Crepe\" is the main attraction and prior to my pretty good cheeseburger, I had an absolutely awful crepe experience. I had the Popeye crepe which according to the menu, had \"spinach, tomato, mozzarella, feta cheese & feta dressing\". In reality it was a tossing of spinach, 2 slices of tomato, a mushy crepe wrap, and some unpalatable goop that stopped me from finishing it.  The 'chef' who made my crepe that day must've had no sense of balance or taste, I wonder if they ever think about how that stuff tastes. Have some pride in your work, folks. Luckily, it's very hard to screw up a burger and fries, so if you are going to Crepe de Licious, avoid the crepes."}
{"text":"The location of Crepe de Licious (inside the Illinois Student Union) will probably be enough to scare off any diner who is not affiliated with the university.  The basement of the union is set up as a mall-style food court, and Crepe de Licious is just another fast food option thrown into the mix.  However, unlike the other union restaurants, which are all recognizable chains (Sbarro, Chick-Fil-A, McAllister's), Crepe de Licious is privately owned and operated (in case you care about that kind of thing).  The rest of the food court area is decorated with cheap plastic furniture, but there is a seating area adjacent to Crepe de Licious that is slightly more private and cozy.  As the name suggests, the primary menu item here are crepes with various fillings, though there are also options for burgers and beef hot dogs.  Also unlike the other restaurants in the union, Crepe de Licious offers breakfast items--if you are traveler staying at the union hotel, you will notice a distinct lack of breakfast restaurants in the campustown area, so Crepe de Licious is one of your few options.  While the crepe varieties are not particularly exciting (just variations of grilled meat, vegetables, cheese, and sauce), I do appreciate that this place uses fresh vegetables in their fillings, including baby spinach and romaine lettuce.  By the way, I am pretty sure their \"special sauce\" (advertised as a topping on most crepes) is just ranch dressing.  Recently, Crepe de Licious introduced \"Bombay wraps\" to their menu.  You can choose your bread (naan or crepe), flavoring (tikka masala, madras curry, etc.), and filling (grilled veggies or meat).  My veggie bombay wrap came with crisp lettuce, grilled mushrooms and peppers, and a chopped veggie burger.  This was a very simple lunch (fairly easy to duplicate at home), but it was still filling and well-seasoned.  I would probably order it regularly when I need a quick lunch on campus.  Most items on the menu cost $5 or less, which is extremely reasonable considering the location and other options at the Student Union.  Crepes, wraps, and burgers are all in the $5 range, while sides (like fries) are only $1.  If you are looking for exotic, refined crepes, I would try Carmon's in downtown Champaign.  However, if you are stuck on campus looking for a cheap, healthy lunch option (and especially if you are a visitor staying at the union hotel), Crepe de Licious would be a sound choice."}
{"text":"I started getting crèpes here when they introduced their $5 turkey crèpe special with a bottle of water.  Oh boy was I in love!  How could you resist that fresh, hot crèpey smell with cranberries, strawberries, turkey and cheese!?  Well, unfortunately, that deal went away.  And so did the crèpe!  I was disappointed when they didn't replace their 5$ combo with another one and definitely disappointed when that crèpe wasn't on the menu. I did order a chicken cordon bleu crèpe and it was fantastic.  The only issue, is the price.   The only people who wouldn't agree that this place is overpriced, are the people who pronounce \"chicken cordon bleu crèpe\" in a fake French accent when ordering.  I think I paid about 10 bucks for this crèpe after adding two eggs to it. Protein galore, but c'mon.  That was without drink.  I gave this place 3 stars because I love the freshness, I love the taste, and I love the unhygenic pocket style packaging to go! They also serve gelato, breakfast crepes and an assortment of drinks.  Save Crepe De Licious as a treat for yourself after a bonus or tax return.  Otherwise, you're going to receive \"wtf did you have for lunch to make our bank account show red\" texts from your spouse."}
{"text":"Well, it wasn't the best crepe I had but it was okay. They added WAY too much nutella. I think what made it unpleasant was the crepe itself. They were just reheating crepes and I wasn't sure if it was crepes they had made earlier or ones they had bought. The texture was a bit disappointing. Not the worst crepe I've had but considering that they have \"crepe\" in their name, I was expecting something a lot better."}
