{"text":"I like their variety of food and bubble teas. I love how they have the traditional milk tea, as that is the original bubble tea. However, the service needs to be worked on as they are not very friendly nor helpful. They don't even smile or acknowledge you. A smile goes a long way guys..."}
{"text":"Came here to try the widely advertised bingsoo (Korean shaved ice dessert). Waited for 30 minutes only to be told their machine was broken. I asked for a refund and the staff seemed surprised. They didn't apologize or offer me a coupon to come back next time. I also tried their bubble tea which they assured me was made from fresh fruit. It was not. It was all powder and sugar and synthetics. I ordered the egg waffle as well which came slightly warm, not hot, and only crispy around the edges (limp and soggy in the middle). As if it had been sitting around for a while before they brought it out. The staff are frazzled, disorganized and not very friendly. I observed several people leave their tables with half-eaten food and desserts left behind. NOT coming back here, ever."}
{"text":"When I arrived, the guy said it would be a 15 minute wait which then became 30 minutes...as well, the drinks weren't as advertised. I pointed out a drink on their sreens which showed whipped cream and pocky. Instead, all I got was a plain smoothie. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Went there to try one of the tea's the guy wasn't helpful. I asked him as a first time patron what  he would recommend for the hot beverages. I told him my likes and dislikes so he could better help me, but nah...He said everything is good and to try the vietnamese something tea. I did...But did I finish it? No, after 2 sips I got rid of it, it was disgusting and I really wish I had the time to go back for a refund. Not worth the time or the money!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and drinks made out of actual fruits, compared to other store's powder ones, awesome service since switch to new owners, amazing place to be in! The shabed ice is a must try."}
{"text":"This place used to be Quickly, but now it's reopened as Jus Fruit under new management, the new owners seem really down to earth and just all around nice people. They recommended the matcha shaved ice which was delicious (very flavorful) ! Definitely coming back here again"}
