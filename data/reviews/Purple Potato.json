{"text":"First time eating there it was really delicious and very fresh, my wife and I enjoyed it I had the fista bowl with shrimp I would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great, healthy food, at a very reasonable price! I would give them more stars but they recently opened so the staff is new and still gaining experience. The service is a little slow now but I'm sure it will pick up. The staff was very pleasant and helpful so if you're patient, you won't be disappointed. I can see this becoming one of our favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a fast lunch. The staff was very friendly and understanding of my allergy needs. Food was fresh and flavored well. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand the great reviews. Perhaps I am weird to actually want food that has flavor...

I ordered a veggie bowl and a falafel sandwich. 

The bowl of rice and beans with vegetables was absolutely flavorless, so bland and I had no clue all they sold here was cold food. Cold rice really isn't tasty folks.

I am glad I was home so I had spices and herbs, olive oil, salt and pepper on hand to make it edible. 

I ordered extra sauces but they didn't include it.

The sandwich came in soggy and not good by any means. 

I ended up throwing up after eating this food, could have been a coincidence..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today looking for a great salad. Cute, clean place with nice tables. You can watch them make your salad or sandwich. All the ingredients are on display. I ordered the ChiChi salad which consisted of kale, spinach, squash, apple, goat cheese, garlic almonds and dried cherries. I added chicken. Tossed with balsamic dressing. I was greatly disappointed. While the greens were fresh everything else was flavorless. The apples (very scant amt) had no flavor. The garlic almonds were terrible. The chicken was boiled and had been sitting in water. No flavor, warm chunks that were dry. The dressing was bland.  Generous portion of greens with scant amount of toppings."}
{"text":"I love how all the negative reviews are complaining about price, lol. Why blame the business for their product being out of YOUR budget? The portions are generous, service is good, ingredients are fresh, concept + menu are well researched and executed... def a few steps ahead of the standard of \"healthy\" food options I've seen here in Vegas. Keep it up :)!"}
{"text":"Read about this place in a magazine, so we stopped to close out 2017 with some yummy food ! And oh boy.... YUM! 
Fresh Food, great flavor, and great service! 
We were even given a complimentary dessert!!
Hubs has the tuna sandwich, he added pickled jalapeños and he said it was amazing. 
I had the Umami bowl. The miso dressing was perfect. 
Make sure you try a Vegan Brownie. You won't regret! 
Nice server, nice owner!"}
{"text":"Super bummed. Went here based on yelp reviews. EXTREMELY over priced! All 4 of us did not enjoy our food and we love healthy salad bowls but in all it was just a bowl of lettuce. Smoothie was also very bland and the sandwich my brother got had little to no tuna on it. Definitely will never go back."}
{"text":"I was looking for something light and tasty for dinner and Purple Potato offers a selection of signature salads, toppings, proteins, house made dressings, soup, wraps, and sandwiches. Since I love the earthy taste of arugula with creamy hummus, I chose the Darma Signature Bowl ($8) which comes with baby spinach, baby arugula, spiced chickpeas, cherry tomato halves, diced cucumbers, bell peppers, parsley, house made hummus, and instead of feta cheese I was allowed to substitute for a different topping, so I chose avocado. 

Plus you get one free topping and I selected furikake, which supposedly is for Umami toppings. It's a dry blend of Japanese seasoning that consists of sesame seeds, seaweed flakes, a mixture of salt, sugar, and dried fish, and it's usually sprinkled on top of a rice dish. I was able to sample furikake prior to having it on my salad and I like that it has good flavor. I would like to add more ingredients though. But keep in mind there is an extra charge (between $0.50 - $0.75) for every additional topping. 

In addition, I wanted a protein and chose the roasted chicken breast ($3) which were cubed chunks of chicken marinated in a hot broth. The chicken is so tender its texture is kind of similar to eating cooked tuna. The salad comes with a sesame orange miso dressing and you have the option to go light, medium, or heavy. I went light on my dressing and I should have chose medium. Who knew that sesame orange miso could be so tasty! The flavor of this dressing goes perfectly well with chicken and it's a really nice combination. When dining in, they offer if you would like bread to have with your salad. I said Yes, just to try it. It's just one slice of chilled multigrain bread which probably would be best served with soup.

Nonetheless everything in my bowl is satisfying and taste delicious. I did enjoy dining in. The place is clean, they have good music playing in the background, and it's a relaxing environment. Just a quick tip at the register, when you enter your mobile number you get a discount on your meal which is always a good thing. I was able to take home leftovers and even request an extra sesame orange miso dressing for my chicken."}
{"text":"Tried this new spot and it was delicious! The staff were nice, the atmosphere was good, and pricing was also good. The only bad thing I have to say is that they put way too much greens in your salad. I noticed every woman taking their left overs to go. I love to eat and can eat a lot but I couldn't even finish it. Overall I highly recommend this joint!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite things to eat are purple potatoes and when I saw this restaurant on my way to church I vowed to stop by once it opened. So today we went in and I ordered their umami bowl with their slow cooked beef and it was divine! I'm not the biggest fan of kale salads when I make it at home but this was hands down one of the best salads I have ever had in my entire life. It had avocado, kabocha squash, edamame, just to name a few things. The texture was crunchy it was a little spicy and overall super fresh and flavorful. I ate my bowl like goku from dragon ball z. My husband asked me if I was all right as he's never really seen me eat like that before. It was that good - let me tell ya. I felt so satisfied and healthier than usual as I am a burger, pizza, and fried chicken kind of gal. Finally something that tastes amazing and won't give me gastritis. It's a clean spot with nice employees. I'm thrilled to have tried this place out."}
{"text":"Came to the Vegefest today and was welcomed by the two owners from this booth. Very friendly and helpful. Explained their new location and all the new menu options and invited us to come in. I purchased the brownie and the cookie and I have to say it was one of the best I've ever had. Moist, flavorful, not too sweet. Above my expectation! And because the service was excellent I will be in soon to try out some vegan options. Thanks staff/owners at purple potato! You won my business over! 

Updated/ new review from 10/12.

I visited the storefront today and was welcomed by both of the waitstaff. Very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable! They explained how THe porridge is made and how they put together each salad bowl. OMG! I purchased both for breakfast and my dinner and I give both 5 stars! He pumpkin seed salad dressing is to die for! I got a salad bowl but ended up putting everything but the kitchen sink. DELISH!

THe berry porridge is awesome and filling! The portions are awesome and can be used twice. I highly recommend this restaurant. The owner and staff are very welcoming. This will be my regular dinner spot. I'm very big on supporting local business and helping them succeed."}
{"text":"I had  the pleasure of eating here a few months ago for a yelp event. Yet my reviews always had an issue with properly saving like 3 whole times. So I will make it short. This place is innovative with an amazing delicious menue and yet it's ever so healthy contious. You can take a variety of picky eater friends  here and they will all find a great mean and even better deserts."}
{"text":"This place is amaZing! Super clean, healthy, and the employees are awesome. I did the create your own bowl which was a great lunch choice. Also tried the strawberry thyme drink, super refreshing!"}
{"text":"So glad that Yonaka Chef Ramir branched out and opened a fast casual  place.  It's more geared to health conscious crowd.  Features DIY /create your own salads. They have preset bowls on the menu as well. My favorite is the UMAMI with quinoa. Portion wise was perfect for me and priced fair. They have that rewards points system that pays off if you are a regular customer. Seems like I get a dollar or close to that knocked off my order.

I also love the warm porridge that they have, but it's only served til early afternoon.  

Check the dessert case, there's delicious vegan cookies and gluten free brownies. 

Dining area is adequate for the amount of traffic that comes in and out of here so we havent had any problem finding  table, even when it gets busy.

Service is great, the staff is friendly...although my next visit I need to  bring up this past visit I asked for the avocados to be left out from the Umami bowl....when I came home and ate it, I got really sick, from the quick onset of it, occured to me later it must have been an allergy reaction. Next time I just have to stress that I have food allergies and cant have even traces of avocado that touches the meal."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for some healthy yummy bowls! Went here after a client recommended it and I am so glad I did! I ordered the Darma Signature Bowl, I recommend it!! Super satisfying"}
{"text":"This yelp page is mixed with the old location and NEW location. 
Be aware that pictures- specifically with grilled salmon is from their old location. They DO NOT have grilled salmon here.

I had their UMAMI BOWL with added Curry Cauliflower and since they didn't have grilled salmon I added extra avocado. This bowl was so YUMMY! I'm not sure if what I had was VEGAN because I didn't ask about their sauce- sesame miso. But what a great option for Vegans and Vegetarians. I'm so happy that this place is on Eastern!! 
One piece of advice to the workers and owner. Please always ask customers if they are new to Purple Potato. Offer your help and guidance with the menu if they need it:)

Will be back to try more items!"}
{"text":"New location warrants a new review, but it's safe to say I'm still a fan- despite the fact that their relocation as a standalone in Henderson means I won't be able to visit as often. The menu of bowls is still fresh and ultra-customizable, and they've added a few new things too. Service was super helpful and friendly for their recent opening, and happy to offer samples.

I usually DIY a bowl, and I always get the fresh raw sashimi-grade salmon. There are tons of choices of fresh veggies from edamame to red bell pepper and healthy bases include wild rice, quinoa, or greens. Dressings are tasty and made in house, sample a few to find what you like. The Dharma and Umami bowls are good options if you're too indecisive to build from scratch. Though the prices are a touch high, everything is super fresh and portions are fair.

Menu has added sandwiches, specifically the Salmon & Egg Salad, which is amazing for brunch- get it with arugula instead of spinach to make it even better. Alternatively, you can get a bowl as a wrap if you're not afraid of extra carbs. They also have a porridge bar, and though I'm usually not a fan due to the texture, the Almond Berry bowl is something I'd get out of bed and cross town for. Don't forget to grab a drink: strawberry thyme agua fresca is my usual pick but the ginger lemonade is solid too.

Purple Potato is going to be a hit in Henderson, if you're tight on time, order online."}
{"text":"Purple potato is a small storefront restaurant on Eastern right next-door to Chili's. Very easy drive by unless you're really looking for it.
Based on the yelp reviews, I thought I would give it a try for lunch today. The counter that you place your order at takes up literally have the store. They are a maybe for a five tables for two along the wall.
I explained to the woman behind the counter that was my first time there, and she was very friendly and helpful in explaining how to order. Basically, it is very similar to every other poke place that I've been to. You choose your base, you choose your veggies, you choose your dressing, you choose your toppings, and you choose your protein. When I got to picking my protein, I was told they were out of everything other than ahi tuna and shrimp. Not terrible choices, but it would be nicer to have more of the choices are on the menu. Next came time to pay. I found that there was a $4.50 up charge for the ahi tuna. To my mind that's a bit unreasonable on two counts. First, a 55% up charge for any item one added to the bill seems a bit steep. Second, they were out of just about everything else so I didn't have a whole lot of choices. 
I also have a relatively minor gripe. They say that they have free Wi-Fi which is great. Except that nobody in the restaurant knew what the password was. So much for the free Wi-Fi.
I must've eaten in three or four other poke restaurants within 3 miles of purple potato. Each of which has equal better ambience, equal or better food choices, and no up charge for one of the two remaining protein choices on the menu. I don't think I will be returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Purple Potato was absolutely my favorite lunch spot when it was on Flamingo & Decatur. I was so excited when I found out that they're moving & having it's own store on Eastern right across from St. Rose Hospital Siena campus. I've patiently waited months for it to open but when I came to try it out on opening week , I was disappointed it's not the same as before. Flavors are the same & food is just as fresh but portion sizes became a lot smaller.

Everything now is pretty much cut in half compared to before. At the old location , the bowl was a lot bigger but now they have these small to-go containers. They don't have the grilled citrus Angus beef or maple braised tofu anymore - they have a similar option for the tofu which was their seasoned tofu but it doesn't look as good. No grilled salmon option available either. I settled for my usual Umami bowl and had their raw salmon & yellowtail as my protein options. Each protein is an additional add-on so my bowl in total was 17$. Paying almost 20$ for lunch is really steep, especially with their portion sizes now. I finished everything in one sitting and after less than two hours I became hungry again. The complimentary Artisan whole grain bread they give I swear is smaller too compared to before.

I do like the idea how everything is in assembly line now rather than dine-in since this type of food is typically casual fast food (but healthy). However , there was also a bit of language barrier when I was ordering. I wanted my bowl customized a little differently even if I got their default Umami bowl but they didn't understand and just glared at me so I just let them do whatever .. it also seemed like they wanted to rush me too although there was zero people in line for lunch. It was just me in line and one other person that was already sitting and eating. Cashier didn't remind me about my stamp card. My friends who also loved this place before also agree w/ me about the changes to new location."}
{"text":"WOW! Loved this place. The staff was so friendly and helpful. They made great suggestions and offered samples. The food tasted fresh and the sauces are all bomb, home made style. Love that you can make your own bowl, so many combinations. Great for vegans or vegetarians. Very clean, chic environment too. Will definitely be eating here again and again."}
{"text":"Got the berry and apple porridge it's by far one of my favorite. My daughter got the pb&j she loves ever bite to it. The house maid jelly is bomb. My husband got the egg salad & bacon sandwich. He loved it so much he bought one more. It's good clean and fast eats."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting the Purple Potato and it was delicious.  Everything was fresh and refreshing the restaurant was very clean and the staff was incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots. I love that they give you the option to create your own bowl. The curry cauliflower and Tofu or simply amazing. I also added the garlic almonds and they're perfect touch to my meal. I also really appreciated that they made my salad very big and Kept me for a long time. The staff members were also very nice and the cookies were delicious as well, particularly the chocolate chip. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"been wanting to try this place since i'm pretty much at matcha house (next door) once or twice a week. the food  was ok nothing out of the ordinary. perhaps a little to much money for a bowl. A little salt would of gone a long way. i don't think ill be coming back nothing really here to draw me in. the staff were not the friendliest either. I feel like there is some potential here but they're missing the mark. be a little more creative and generous with portions then i'll return if you want me to."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today for lunch and what a pleasant little surprise. You're greeted as soon as you walk through the door. There's a sign that tells you where to order and where to pay. I made my way over to the order counter and the sweet employee behind the glass asked me if it was my first time. I always appreciate when employees ask that. It makes me feel at ease for some reason. 

Their menu is extensive. There's sandwiches, porridge, dessert, smoothies, and beverages. You can also make your own bowls/wraps or you can choose from their Signature bowls/wraps. I got the Yona bowl and added chicken to it. Total was about $11. 

While I was waiting for my salad to be made, another employee asked if I wanted to sample one of their porridge...I love samples so of course I said yes. I wish I had asked which porridge that was because it was bomb. It had a berry compote to it. Maybe it was the Berry and Apple? 

Onto the salad. You guys. It's bomb. I can't believe I could love a salad so much. Much of it has to do with the chicken. It wasn't dry at all and it was nice and MOIST (everyone's favorite word haha). The salad also came with parmesan crisps which i wasn't expecting at all so that was a nice surprise. The dressing is a yuzu caesar and it paired nicely with the veggies. While the price may be a bit high, you do get a large amount of food so it's worth it! 

Service and food was great so I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love that Las Vegas/Henderson are getting more and more vegan options. This place was so good I somehow found a way to go three days in a row! They are the perfect place to go when you want a healthy, filling lunch. Their chipotle-style build your own salads, bowls, wraps, and sandwiches make it perfect for customizing any order. The one reason why I went back three days in a row was because I had to try one of their porridges (oatmeal). They have a couple vegan options that were extremely delicious and as any vegan I'm a sucker for great oatmeal and theirs did not disappoint. Their house made agua frescas, lemonade, and tea are also delicious and if you have a sweet tooth definitely don't pass up any of the treats in their bake case (all vegan!!). if you're in Henderson or if you want to try something new for lunch definitely check this place out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Lots of healthy options and also unhealthy. Ive been here a few times since they opened and im loving the clean environment and delicious food. Ive gotten plenty of friends to come here and they are hooked. They also have a variety of porridges that are so good! I got the brown cinnamon and pair and I'm addicted. Its definitely going to hit the spot once it gets a little cooler in Vegas. Their drinks are tasty and have a homemade feel to them. A lot of other places are over priced but this place price is great. I don't have to break the bank! Which makes me come more haha."}
{"text":"Can I race any faster to a place?

Purple Potato is my jam, their food is delicious the staff so so so friendly.

Thank you Jax for making every experience so warm and welcoming 

I wish there was one right next to my house, I would be there every single day if I could."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite restaurants in the area. The food is wonderful and I have always had the best of service. A special thank you for taking care of us today, being patient while we ordered and making us a spectacular and healthy meal!  The coco salad is my favorite and the porridge is outstanding (I would love for you guys to a small portion as I like this kind of thing for dessert!). Such a great place and your kindness today was spectacular. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great new place on Eastern with loads of healthy options.  The staff is very friendly and easily walk you thru the ordering process. You have lots of options to choose from but they will walk you thru them and make informative recommendations.  I love the make your own bowl.  Sometimes I go as a salad and others as a quinoa bowl.  Don't forget to sign up for their rewards program too.

PS. You can order online too"}
{"text":"Walked in nice looked like they were doing a podcast. Very nice place they explained to me that there was a lot of food available gave me a menu looked it over. But all I wanted to try was this purple Potato pudding. They told me they didn't make it yet. Why post it up on your yelp and not sell it. Sad man sad. Hopefully they step up on there game and start making it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I love the healthy menu options. The porridge was so good. The staff was very friendly and the place was nice and clean. I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Great hidden healthy gem!  Fun little place. Friendly staff. Fresh ingredients. Unique add ins - I tried kabocha (a roasted pumpkin) and kikurage. The green tea lemonade is awesome - deliciously tart!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Looks like S. Eastern is becoming a hub of great food for Las Vegas/ Henderson.  The food at the restaurant is great for those trying the eat heathy.  Salads made to order, sandwiches, and more.  Clean restaurant, polite and service-oriented staff."}
{"text":"The portions are way bigger than they look in pictures, but still so yummy! we got the umami with bulgogi and drama with ahi tuna. Made them into combos with soup and a drink!"}
{"text":"I really hope Purple Potato makes it! Great place, priced well, clean and great counter service. They have a little bit of every option. Vegans/vegetarian, pescatarian, plant based, carnivore and just people who love fresh food! Make your own bowl is the way to go but they also have signature bowls as well. Great concept Purple Potato! The only downfall is Getting in to park, its a bit of a pain but worth the time. I support them and I hope you do. We need a cool little spot like this in Henderson! Tell ya friends! I highly recommend. :)"}
{"text":"Seriously...I'm assuming all the 5 star reviews are friends of the owners and staff. This is literally the most overpriced pretentious salad bar we've ever experienced. One star is for the very friendly and helpful staff, and the other star is for the freshness of the ingredients-THAT'S IT! For $29, equaling 2 salads and ONE $3 drink, 2.5 of us could've eaten at many other places, and had way more food with beverages for everyone, for example: Sweet Tomatoes. Not to mention, the menu is clearly misleading on the salad selections where it says + Add protein. No, rather PAY FOR YOUR PROTEIN-Not included! And yes, like another previous customer said there was no one else in there when we went in. No need to explain why."}
{"text":"A variety of fresh ingredients made for a pretty picture, but unfortunately the taste was underwhelming. Also, the service was excruciatingly slow considering there were only two other tables. 

I had an umami bowl with Japanese yellowtail... everything was fresh and healthy, but ultimately the flavor just wasn't there. It needed a little more of something, because this dish definitely wasn't \"umami\"."}
{"text":"I was hungry and wanted something close by Siena Campus hospital in case i had to run back, and something healthy! 
Purple potato is across the street from Siena Campus. you can even walk there.
Zuppa cafe can take example of this little place ...
Staff was very pleasant and helpful, product was fresh and very nice variety of ingredients!
I walked in not knowing what to order. Staff was very pleasant and patient. They even offer to make me try the salad dressing :) because i was curious!
the place was very clean! 
I ordered a bowl and created my own salad bowl
Arugula, quinoa, kabocha, pear, beets and marinated shrimp.
the salad was so so good! They serves you TRUE portion not like at ZUPPA's cafe where you have to fight to get your salad topping ...
the salad comes with a piece of bread which was very taste and good. A little butter would be a plus
I couldn't resist for a Vegan Brownie. That wasn't my favorite. I couldn't taste the chocolate in it :/
First time since a long time I got excited to eat my food from a new place!
it was a very good choice. You can eat there as well. Spacious area :)"}
{"text":"Loving the healthy choices, wish they would stay open later tho and deliver farther than they do already.  BUt the flavors and different things you can put in your bowls go well together and taste delicious!  Keeps me full all day and not snacking at work!"}
{"text":"If you're sensitive to ingredients, like me, this place is a great option! You can customize your entire order, without the shameful feeling of being a P.I.T.A. I ordered a pick-your-own salad and it was enormous & ingredients were overflowing, nice to know that they're not skimping out on you.  My son is a super picky eater & loved their pulled pork sandwich. The environment is really clean and inviting. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients that cater to everyone whether vegan, vegetarian or just a plain eater. The food is super yummy, the service is great & the desserts are even better."}
{"text":"Bowls must be the new thing. 
This is a newer but not brand new venture for the Yonaka Modern Japanese restaurant owners. We are late in trying it, but the concept is fresh, build-your-own!
Nice because it would be tough to make all these toppings and fixin's at home, without being very industrious. I recommend you try it...can't complain you don't like it, right. Yeah cause you built it yourself. Great fresh juice infusions, really nice service and a bright cheerful spot to eat. Looks like sandwich bread is also baked freshly....mmmmm. So next time I want a sandwich or fresh porridge! I'll be back! Do yourself a favor and try this healthy alternative for breakfast, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite lunch spot! The Cici Salad and Beef Sandwich are delicious, and the fresh Ginger Peach Lemonade is my new addiction! I've tried all of the porridges, and prefer the Almond Berry. The egg salad sandwich with bacon is also good, and my friend loves the chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"For salad and clean fresh eating this place ranks among the best in Henderson. The Tomato soup has somehow taken a serious step backwards, but it's my wife's favorite salad in town which has merit. If you love salad this spot is gold"}
{"text":"I love this place the most is the variety of delicious greens and healthy choices you get to eat. I went with \"build your own\" and picked out everything that I wanted including dressing.  It tasted so amazing good and I definitely will come back again and again."}
{"text":"I know what you are thinking. How can a salad bar get a 5 star rating I have eaten here at least 20 times have never had a bad  salad, it's always clean the staff is super friendly and helpful. All salad and proteins have calories listed.
While I am on the subject of protein let me start with the fish uncooked Salmon, Japanese Yellow Tail, Ahi Tuna. Also available is cooked chilled Shrimp, Tuna Salad. Roasted Chicken, Shredded Beef, and Slow Cooked Pork are the turf selection of meat.

PP also makes sandwiches and porridge. The drink fountain is worth the trip, and the Vegan Brownie is to die 4. Be sure to join the rewards program they are generous on free stuff."}
{"text":"So happy a healthy option restaurant opened in the St Rose /S Eastern area ! It is amazing ,clean ,friendly , and sooo many options to choose from !!"}
{"text":"Kept hearing about this healthy food spot. So we finally made it here! I love the \"create your own bowl\" option and that was what I went with today. The smoked salmon & egg sandwich looked bomb too but I'll save that for another day. 

The options for creating your own bowl can be overwhelming with so many options but once you narrow down what you're in the mood for, it gets easier. Everything looked super fresh. The prices were fair. And the food was clean and delicious! 

Super fresh & healthy eats. My \"create your own bowl\" option: raw ahi tuna, quinoa, spring mix, spicy garlic almonds, cucumbers, jicama, roasted beets, roasted cauliflower and furikake. Drizzled with a sesame orange miso dressing and Sriracha. Freaking delicious!

My friend got the vegan brownies and before you judge....it was ridiculously good!!! Crunchy exterior and super moist and chewy inside. I forgot to take a pic because we tore it up so fast. Highly recommended.

The owners were incredibly nice, helpful and friendly. Very accommodating. They were just happy we stopped in. I'm madly in love with the ambiance and decor of this spot too. Clean and open space. We'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch with my sister. They just opened and told us everything about their menu. 
I got the dharma(?). Everything tasted good except the arugala was very bitter, but i should have not gotten that. Fault on my part. Also, I am really picky on my hummus and was pleasantly surprised with the flavor.

We tried The porridge. We had the purple butter, house made granola, blueberries, and strawberries. I would get this again and again! The purple butter is heavenly. Just give me a gallon of that.
  
The strawberry drink was wonderful as well. 

My only gripe is I wish it was a little bigger place. Lunch time comes around and it gets full pretty quickly. Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to get dinner for the kids. The place was empty. The floor and chairs were dirty. It was strange to see that considering two employees were present and no patrons. The kids enjoyed their sandwiches, but we will not be coming back. When an establishment is empty, I expect employees to be keeping things tidy."}
{"text":"I just had my first Purple potato build your own bowl, and it was a perfect guilt-free post-workout dinner! There's tons of options for vegetarians! The drinks are pretty amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Decent vegan meal, and nice decor. However the moment I arrived I received a lukewarm welcome. After being served my meal, And 15 mins in the waitress asks me if I want a box. 

Which is weird since my laptop is out and I'm actively eating. There was No refill on my water. It's pretty obvious why I was treated this way. Don't rush your customers out, allow them to enjoy their meal even you don't enjoy your job."}
{"text":"The girls behind the counter were nice enough. The bowl that I got was alright , it wasn't great. I got the porridge with the purple potato topping and I went to heaven and came back. I would go back over and over again just for that"}
{"text":"Such friendly staff who are patient and knowledgeable. The bowls are absolutely amazing and super easy to customize! The house made bread that comes with each bowl is so delicious too. Gave us a complimentary house-made tea and they were amazing! The purple pudding tasted just like a pumpkin pie too. Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Got the coco bowl and added salmon and yellow tail as well as bean sprouts! So yummy and it was a perfect post workout meal. You can also create your own bowl! I'll be back forsure. Forgot to take a pic of my food ?"}
{"text":"Love this place! Tried it for the first time couple of days ago and have already been back! Fresh, healthy food, friendly staff, great service. For a first timer I'd recommend trying a bowl off the menu to get an idea. I'm already addicted to the Darma bowl and the egg/smoked salmon sandwich!"}
{"text":"I love this place for the food, but everytime ive come here its been an issue. The older lady has just put ingredients I havent asked for on my bowl. The prices are different every time, and I have never changed my order. Its beyond frustrating because I crave this place but dread coming here."}
{"text":"Yes please!
What a breath of fresh air. Healthy and great tasting fast food....did I mention reasonably priced! 
I discovered this place Monday night while dining at Yonaka for sushi ( that will be another great review) the Staff told our table about all the fresh made ingredients and drinks they serve during lunch and encouraged us to download the app and take menus.
I was back on that side of town today so decided to preorder some lunch on their app.
I got the darma bowl with steak and a cucumber mint lemonade....holy good!
I couldn't even finish my bowl in one sitting....and I wish the drinks came in a larger size.
I will be back and next time I'll take some pics!!"}
{"text":"Healthy and fast option in Henderson. In and out in 5 minutes. Calorie counts on the menu. Menu has about 8 set bowls and then also a make your own option. At $8 without protein, Purple Potato is definitely on the high side of good for you lunch options. But the bowls are huge and the ingredients fresh. My only compliant is that each extra veggie is $0.50. That's a bit much when each bowl only comes with about 4 or 5 so the bowl gets a little boring when 60% is greens. 

I had the Ali bowl which came with beets, radish, broccoli, and some onion on top of spinach. I added in Yellowtail - a must for any bowl. My meal was perfect and exactly what I was hoping for.  But at $13.50 its a tough buy for your typical lunch."}
{"text":"Purple Potato is OPEN again!  Fresh and delicious! So excited to have a local healthy and quick option like this in Henderson. I ordered the umami bowl with extra falafel and the falafel hummus sandwich for my husband. 

We both enjoyed our lunch and you can tell the ingredients are very fresh. The umami bowl had great flavor and I loved the orange miso dressing (next time I need to get more because the portions are substantial!) Prices are very reasonable, staff is friendly and it's a great space.

They also have delicious agua fresca which I sampled the hibiscus lemon and strawberry thyme. I love that they aren't too sweet. They also have a selection of coconut water and Perrier. Looking forward to coming back. Yum!"}
{"text":"Im in love with this place!I could eat the mushrooms and tofu every day!The chimichurri sauce is fabulous and the sweets are a perfect topper after a bowl! Have to try it!"}
{"text":"Purple Potato has been open for some time now but it wasn't until a few months ago that I finally made an effort to go. 

I've been to Purple Potato a few times this year.  The only reason why is because they make an egg salad sandwich the way I would want to make an egg salad sandwich if all the ingredients were prepared for me. I love their salmon and egg sandwich as well as their bacon and egg sandwich.

Although I gave Purple Potato 4-stars, its because I am a fan of the egg salad sandwiches.

But what I also love about sandwiches is hot soup, not miso soup, but chicken noodle soup or a cheddar and broccoli soup.  Which they don't offer.

And I'm not a fan of fruit! I guess because of being Filipino, when I think of porridge, I don't think fruit. I think chicken, ginger, bok choy, rice noodles, but not fruit. And they have cold fruity porridge. I just don't get it.

What I also like with my sandwiches? Chips! I love potato chips. The matcha green tea cafe next door sales fries. Why doesn't Purple Potato sell fries? I was there last week. While I was waiting for the counter person help the customer in front of me, the customer mentioned that she had the purple potato pie pocket.  She said it  was really good, but it was too sweet.  She recommended that it be made with regular potato so it wouldn't be so sweet.

And I also like salads with my sandwiches. They don't offer a side salad.

My last visit, it took the counter girl over 8-minutes to make what I thought was a simple tuna sandwich. It takes me 8-minutes to make a tuna sandwich because I have to prep everything myself. As far as I could see, all the ingredients are already prepped. So I don't understand why it took so long.

The few times I've been to Purple Potato, I've noticed the majority of the customers are women. There is a reason why women at times need something a little salty. Just one week out of the month. Fruity porridge just isn't going to do it. Chips, fries, and/or chicken noodle soup sure does it the spot.

I know it appears I did a lot of complaining. I just don't get the rest of their menu. But once again, I really am a fan of their egg salad sandwiches and that's why Purple Potato gets a 4-stars from me."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at Purple Potato this evening and could not have been more disappointed. To start off the proteins which should have been in a heated pan on the steam table, we're sitting in a plastic cambro on the counter. I am pretty sure that does not pass Health codes. Should have left then, but proceeded to order, we created our own bowls. Tried the falafels \"Rocks\", they had to have been made yesterday. They were so hard you could not bite through them. They were literally rocks. Hopefully we survive the night."}
{"text":"Watch out for a deceptive menu!  I ordered a Darma salad for $8.  Although they toss it for you, it was mostly just lettuce.  Then I told them I wanted chicken as my protein.  The gal behind the counter scooped out a ladle full of cubed chicken which looked like it was in a steamer of some kind.  Then she charged me an additional $3 making the salad $11.  If you look at the menu, it says the salad is $8 + protein.  It doesn't say chicken, an additional $3.  This was the first time I had been there, so I didn't know.  The salad served in a small plastic bowl is so overpriced it's pathetic.  Mostly salad, the chicken was dried out, the dressing was tasteless and the hummus was worse.  Not worth $11.  Maybe the other menu items are a better bargain, but I won't be going back again.  I'll stick to Sweet Tomatoes as that is a much better deal!"}
{"text":"I don't like to waste any room in my belly on not so great food, especially when it is my cheat meal.  After some yelping and looking at various establishment's menu, I came across Purple Potato by Yonaka.  I love Yonaka so I decided to try out Purple Potato.  The menu is quite interesting.  We ended up getting the following:

1. Create your own bowl - very fresh greens, healthy toppings, orange miso dressing, ahi tuna and yellowtail.  The raw chunks of fish were all fresh and tasty.  Very good quality ingredients.
2. Smoked salmon and egg sandwich - This was so tasty and filling.
3. We got the in-house made agua frescas - I tried all 4 (strawberry thyme, cranberry green tea, peach mojita, spinach something lemonade) flavors and they were all delicious.  

While we were there, the nice staff gave us a sample of the porridge.  OMG, I have to take the baby and come back for the porridge for breakfast.  The porridge has all sorts of texture and flavor.   We also got a fresh made in house apple streusel muffin, compliments of the chef.
I have been to many poke places around town, but hands down, Purple Potato is the best.  The high quality ingredients, the friendly staff, the décor and ambience...I will be a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Ordered a wrap, when I arrived, was a Bowl.
Wrap fell apart completely due to an inexperienced maker slicing the wrap in half when it had no liquid or sauce binder holding the ingredients together. Fell apart in my lap, all over my car. Had ingredients I didnt order.
Threw it away, waste of time & money!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. They even had vegan treats such as cookies and brownies. So delicious!"}
{"text":"So happy to have found this healthy delicious fast food restaurant! Fresh tasty salads created exactly the way I like them! I had started a diet and since it's a no-carb , mostly greens with a little protein this was the perfect place to get a delicious diet salad that I enjoy and fills me up! Best part I have reached my weight goal. But since I love the Salads I'll keep going back!!"}
{"text":"I use Purple Potato all the time for my catered lunches. 
IT IS AMAZING! I have never had an unhappy office. Indri is also great and so helpful.
I accidentally didn't order enough food one time and she went back to pick up 4 more sandwiches and a salad for me. 
Best customer service of all time. I highly recommend them for food and for catering."}
{"text":"Very surprised there was not a single person in here. I would assume with a new \"poke-type\" spot there would be a swarm of eager eaters. This place has a ton of options that are not typical to a BYOB (\"Build Your Own Bowl\") place. Would love to come here for lunch a few days a week as I would not get bored with the choices. My choices:

2 Bases
- Farro
- Quinoa

Protein
- Yellowtail

4 Basic Toppings
- Roasted Beets
- Carrot Dumplings
- Sauteed Mushroom Mix
- Roasted Kabocha (Japanese squash)

Umami Topping
Smoked Maple Coconut

Dressing
Lemongrass Jalapeno

Was very delicious, but they NEED menu ballots! As you can see from the amount of options, it would be easier for everyone to have a pick and choose menu to write on.

Definitely coming back and probably going to start ordering online for the office (they deliver within 3 miles or you can use an external app to get them)."}
{"text":"What a totally fun surprise! There are so many flavor combinations here, something for every taste! My husband got the new protein Korean bulgogi in a build your own bowl and I had the miso salmon with the umami bowl. Both of us loved the flavors. The options of veggies, greens, dressings and toppings are amazing. I will definitely come here again and bring friends!"}
{"text":"This places salad tastes delicious but the service was to slow. There was hardly anyone at the restaurant and yet we had to wait a long time."}
{"text":"This is a nice, healthy fast casual restaurant.  You order in line and pick what you want in a bowl or wrap.  They also have sandwiches.  I built my own salad and it was good.  They have nice options to choose from.  The menu was a little confusing for the first time.  You may need some extra time to process it all the first time you go.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My go to place for the best Vegan brownies in Vegas!!!! And the porridge is my favorite breakfast there....I recommend Purple Potato for your laid back place for quality food and avoiding the  heavy crowds during the day !!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The Lipa Bowl with Portobello Mushroom Mix is my favorite. I've been coming to this location in Henderson since the day they opened and I keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"Honestly don't understand any raves about this place. Very pricy and food was subpar. I don't typically write bad reviews, however I spent $15 on a bowl that I felt should've been less than half that. The food was very average. However the location was a very nice environment I didn't think the food was worth it."}
{"text":"This establishment is so great from the food to the service and there name is so appealing too. We were greeted as we walked in and looked lost staring at their menu, but Jaime rescued us. We opted to create our own bowl. We ended up going with a greens bowl where the guest gets to pick two. We choose the spinach and darker greens. Then off to four choices for the bowl we chose. We selected squash, apple, carrot, and broccoli. Then we topped it with feta cheese and sesame dressing. 

The bowl that we created is one size and I shared it with one of my twins for girls day out. It is really that large. The cost of their food here is so amazing. At just $9.00 for our large bowl and such great service , thank you staff of the Purple Potato for providing such healthy alternatives that is hard to make sometimes since so busy. That is priceless and so is Jaime.

Decided to dine in again here and update the review. Each and every time that I do visit here I continue to have awesome customer service and the most pleasant experience. The craving for one of their salads just came on today and I am going to indulge, besides it is extremely healthy. So why not.

I was waiting for the Purple Potato to open this morning and they opened promptly and on time. I was able to get in straight away for some much needed fantastic food. I ordered the make it your own salad this time as well and added portobello mushrooms to it . And even had dessert this time with an apple cinnamon muffin. No one can make salads like this business and I am glad that lunching again here."}
{"text":"The UMAMI bowl was incredibly hard to eat. The vegetable textures was dry and lacked flavor. Had to take sips of water after every spoonful."}
{"text":"I'd never had a poke bowl before I came here and I wasn't disappointed at all. For someone who doesn't really like seafood, their raw salmon was amazing. The purple pudding was phenomenal and all the ingredients were very fresh. Just wish they sold the maple balsamic dressing by the bottle, would've loved to take some home. You get to choose one of their premade bowls or make your own. I'd definitely recommend the Cici bowl."}
{"text":"This food is BOMB!  The salad was amazing,  I chose the maple balsamic vinegar and it was delicious, the greens were fresh and best of all the service was great.  Although this place is far from my house as I live in the southwest Purple Potato is definitely on my regular places to eat.  You can sample anytjing in there also which helps in the decision making process.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This feels like a Japanese fusion restaurant saw the poke bowl trend and decided to do a healthy take on it using a wide array of ingredients. Maybe that's because it is?

Purple Potato is a customizable bowl/wrap concept by Yonaka Modern Japanese, a beloved local restaurant. The poke bowl inspiration is at best my own speculation, but you can see via social media and older reviews that they launched late in 2016 and operated as a sort of lunchtime pop-up in the Yonaka space, mainly providing takeout but reportedly allowing sit-down patrons later on. Then they decided to stop running it in Yonaka and spinned it out to a standalone restaurant.

Enter the new spot next to Chili's on Eastern just across from the St. Rose Siena Hospital. They have that line setup with glass barrier that's seen in the Chipotle / poke bowl sort of model, and there are plenty of seats if you don't need to leave right away. Thankfully, this location is a very convenient post-work stop for me.

However, owing to a busy schedule, I had to swing by on the weekend to catch the last day of their grand opening week (20% off to the public). It was a planned visit with Stefany V. Thanks to her sharing, as well as some generosity by the manager, I was able to sample items from most of their menu, including the bowls and wraps (from 8 \"signature\" recommended combos or customized any which way you'd like), sandwiches, porridges, and from-scratch beverages. I didn't get to any smoothies or desserts, but there's time in the future if I wish.

I should also note that I've yet to try customizing the bowl due to costs/unfamiliarity. Although the bases (up to two salads/starches), dressing (choose 1 of 10 available dressings and up to 3 \"extras\" such as olive oil or citrus), and 4 toppings are free, the proteins range from $1.50-$4.50 extra each (up to two per order) and additional toppings up to a max of 14 run either $0.50 for regular toppings or $0.75 for premium. Aside from the proteins, which may get lost this way, all of the ingredients are mixed together for an even flavor distribution.

My choice of signature bowl was the Umami ($8), which is surprisingly tasty and complex for something that qualifies as vegan. Along with a moderate level of dressing (light or heavy being the other options offered by the prep employee), the ingredients such as kale, quinoa, and avocado already formed a great array of flavors and textures. However, I noticed the roasted kabocha most of all, measuring it out in bites as a sort of protein substitute. This was important because I found my one protein add-on, raw yellowtail ($4), was a bit lacking in portion size. At least it was as fresh and delicious as you'd expect from Yonaka.

I also enjoyed the salmon ($4), green goddess dressing, and whatever mix of condiments Stefany brewed up in her bowl. My photo of it suggests that there was a spring mix as the base, some edamame, and a variety of other toppings. Definitely choose a variety of textures if you wind up building your own bowl.

The sandwiches also look promising. Smoked Salmon & Egg ($8.50) had a lovely mix of flavors between the salmon, the egg salad, and the veggies. I enjoyed a mere bite of it, but If the whole sandwich truly does run just 380 calories, then that's easily a healthy yet very satisfying lunch.

The remaining tastes which I had were on the house. The Almond Berry porridge ($7 normally) was a pretty hefty-looking bowl that could be suited for breakfast. It was like a rich PB&J (or AB&J, I suppose) oatmeal but with far better texture, owing to a few crunchy grains and strawberry.

The array of four beverages (no fountain drinks here, folks) was also a treat. Although I found the Hibiscus Lemon Agua Fresca to be a bit boring, the Strawberry Thyme Agua Fresca and Ginger Peach Lemonade were both delicious and not too sweet. But for $3, I would actually buy the Cranberry Iced Green Tea ($3), owing to the easily tasted green tea flavor. If you normally frequent bubble tea shops for fruit-flavored green teas, then you'll love this drink.

I like Purple Potato a lot so far, and they're definitely a great option for health-conscious eaters and a must-try for anyone. That's not necessarily my main concern when I do dine out though, and the premium protein pricing model is offputting. However, maybe I'll decide that the latter is not so bad if I end up tasting and enjoying more of those meats and fish."}
{"text":"Omg! GO TO THIS NOW!! 

Not only was my create-your-own salad DELICIOUSLY AMAZING... They have quite a nice size selection of Vegan Desserts!!! I got the Vegan Choc Chip Almond cookie!!  

The also have a ton of sandwich options as well as GLUTEN FREE BREAD!! Those who are GF know how hard this is to come across.

For a quick & easy mouth-gasmic salad and/or sandwich this is THE place to go!!!"}
{"text":"Lots of fresh options (a lot more than Tokyo Joe's), generous portions, and friendly service.  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Tons of healthy items and the salads are huge! Definitely enough for 2 and you can make your own or go with one of their signature dishes ... the Darma was awesome the humus went really well with the spinach salad"}
{"text":"This place is great, the quality and the service are consistent! Purple Potato is 5 mins away from my office, so is often my lunch choice. The tomato soup is my favorite, but every single item I've ordered is super tasty!!"}
{"text":"Purple Potato over Yonaka's expensive appetizers and cold dishes.  Man you get mad full offa these salads and drinks.  They're appropriately priced and delicious.  I only come here to Yonaka's 11am-5pm.  The few times I've went for sushi I was disappointed.  I've. Brought back quite a number of people to eat here.  I can't say much that will justify the explaining of my experience in words.  If you're a health nut, vegan, or vegetarian, this is a great spot!  If you're a meat and cheese, disgusting over eater, this place is still a blast!"}
{"text":"Healthy doesn't mean it won't taste good... unless it's Purple Potato. With such delicious sounding salads with fancy ingredients (Umami with kabocha?! Edamame?! Quinoa?!) I had high expectations...
The Umami with kale portion was HUGE. I wish they had half sizes. I couldn't finish the salad.... is that an actual problem? You could easily split the salad with 2 people. The salmon is raw- FYI.
They have vegan desserts that are supposedly a huge hit. I'll have to try it next time! (If I ever go back...)"}
{"text":"I have driven by Purple Potato almost everyday since it opened, but I had given it some time before actually stopping in to try it. I will start by saying I was not unpleased with my experience entirely, but I was also not as impressed as I thought I'd be, hence my choice of \"3 stars.\" The service I received was great, the price was also good I thought for the option. Where I was disappointed honestly was how they made my bowl. I was expecting a few bites of greens with a lot of toppings, protein, etc. I think they should make the toppings unlimited like a poke bowl place and not limit it to four before being charged extra. What I was so confused on was the amount of greens. I asked for baby spinach, and I was given an entire Costco-sized bag of spinach to the point where I could not find anything else in my bowl and it was more of an obnoxious salad rather than a bowl. Seriously, I love my spinach, and I was so perplexed as to what I was given. I was honestly unable to eat the food normally because it was such a complete mess. I will probably give it another try, but I will let them know I want about 1/10 of the greens they gave me. So odd!"}
{"text":"Mannn $17 for a glorified DIY salad is wayyyy too ambitious for Purple Potato to be charging. I could've bought the same weight in leafy greens and sushi grade fish for $11. 

I can see the appeal and the gimmick which is cool. Maybe I just ordered wrong. Maybe the line behind me pressured me to choose the wrong selections. 

Like I said, I did a DIY bowl and thought it stayed within the \"Pick up to 2\", \"Pick up to 4\" instructions. But if you get fish, check the prices beforehand. Apparently when it says \"Pick up to 2\", you get chaged for both proteins and not just the more expensive of the two with half the serving. BUMMER. 

Could've just gone to a poke bowl place for a $6 equivalent. 

I'll come back when I want a delicious $9 salad. 

My bad :("}
{"text":"I am a fan because of their Almond berry porridge, pineapple cilantro lemonade, and their falafel & hummus sandwich. I had the pleasure of attending a Yelp Elite Private event with Purple Potato and it was definitely a treat. The items I named above were my favorites but pretty much everything they served us was really good. I will say that their ham  & cheese was the least favorite because it was fairly plain. 

Their Umami bowl was really good. It flavorful and light and it's nice meal to have if you're looking for something on their healthier/light side. I loved the sesame orange miso dressing. It wasn't too overpowering at all. 

I would definitely come back and make the journey from Summerlin for their Almond berry porridge though. That was by far my favorite item! It's basically their version of oatmeal with their purple potato butter, which I'm assuming is purple yam or in Filipino cuisine, Ube. It had other mix ins but it's just heaven in your mouth. I could honestly eat it everyday if I had the option to. 

The service was great and so was the food. I can't complain! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this heathy new edition to the neighborhood. So many variations of salads and bowls and great ingredients and delicious drinks too"}
{"text":"Purple potato is the perfect choice for anyone looking for a healthy meal in this area. Having recently moved to Las Vegas, I am disappointed by the lack of availability of \"healthy\" lunch options in the area. Purple potato has a good selection of salads, bowls and wraps and you can even create your own. The quality and variety of ingredients make this the best healthy lunch spot in the area, by far outperforming it's competitors. You could come here many times without ever getting the same thing and being happy with everything."}
{"text":"We arrived just after 7PM on a Sunday evening to find an empty restaurant as it remained throughout our visit sans 2 employees.  My wife and I each ordered Darma bowls with chicken, but were told there was only enough chicken for one so I opted for pulled pork. These bowls were not nearly a tasty as our prior choices (Ali and Umami) though all the ingredients (spinach and arugula, spiced chickpeas, hummus, parsley and feta tossed in a sesame orange miso dressing) were fresh.  A rating of 2.5 stars is considered most appropriate."}
{"text":"Build your own salad or wrap with some sushi grade sushi? Count me in! With a fun name like Purple Potato, it makes you want to know more what they are all about. It's located in a strip mall next to Chili's and an up and coming tea house which led me to the Purple Potato. When you enter, the place is super clean and organized. It has several seatings, but it's not a huge spot for large groups. The majority of the store is taken up by the large rows of colorful, fresh, and unique greens and proteins to choose from. 

A young gentleman greeted me and explained to me how to build my bowl or wrap. I could create my own or go with one of their signature menu choices. I went with the Umami Bowl based off the recommendation of another Yelper and so glad I did. As I was ready to watch my bowl made, a very friendly lady came out to prepare it. I think she might be the owner. Either way she was very sweet and prepared my meal with care and attention.   I opted for mixed greens as my base, but you have the option of kale or crisp romaine. I then went with quinoa (because I'm trying to learn to like it), then she added bean sprouts, edamame, avocado, my choice of protein ( I went with Japanese Yellowtail ), and a dressing where you can say go light, medium or heavy on. Medium dressing for me.

Turns out the young gentleman helping me out initially was in training, as the lady showed him how to ring me up. He was still calm, friendly and informed me they have gluten free brownies. The lady also offered me some slices of bread their chef makes for them daily. They were so soft! I learned that they are from the Yonaka Japanese restaurant, thus the sticker on their bowl.I also learned that the bowl itself is super filling. The fish was fresh and had a good firmness to it. Between the crunch of the bean sprouts, to the creaminess of the avocado and edamame, it was a cornicopia of textures that all married with the bright slightly citrusy, possibly sesame oil based dressing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"For initial visits, the chef-created bowls are recommended as they come equipped with toppings and a dressing. Then, you simply choose a base(s) and protein (the price of your bowl is determined by your choice of protein ranging from $8-12). BTW, the raw salmon, tuna, and yellowtail options are all sashimi-grade fish. YEEEAH! There are seven bowls, eight bases, and 10 proteins AKA a lot of combinations. Also, you can choose the level of dressing (less dressing, medium, or a lot); I've been going with medium and have been pleased.

I've tried five of the chef-created bowls, three of the bases, and four of the proteins. They're all delicious. My favorite bowls (so far):

UMAMI: kale, roasted kabocha, bean sprouts, sauteed mushroom mix, kikurage, avocado, spiced mix nuts, and sesame orange miso dressing. This was great with the grilled citrus angus beef and lemon herb brown rice, but also tasty with roasted chicken breast and additional greens.

CICI: kale, roasted sweet potatoes, gala apple, goat cheese, toasted almonds, dried tart cherries, balsamic maple dressing. I paired this bowl with organic farro, organic kale, and raw Scottish salmon. AAAAMAZING. I'd be happy just eating this again and again.

DARMA: housemade hummus, organic spinach, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, bell pepper, kalamata olives, feta cheese, parsley, chickpea croutons, and sesame orange miso dressing. This is a fantastic combination and unsurprisingly, a customer favorite. I'm sure it would be delicious paired with anything because I didn't think it would work with raw salmon and it totally did. The hummus is phenomenal!

The bowls are generously-sized and at an amazing price. They also come with a large slice of their housemade Artisan whole grain bread and it is soo good.

I highly recommend the Purple Potato Chips ($3); they're seasoned with a variety of spices (cinnamon, cayenne, etc) and now served with a tasty mango yogurt sauce. These chips are amazing. You really will want a bowl of your own. The Mexican chocolate pudding with mixed nuts ($4) and Purple potato pudding with cashew ($4) are both tasty sweets options AND Vegan. I've also enjoyed the Housemade ginger ale ($3) and Iced cranberry green tea ($3).

Even though I'm a huge fan of Yonaka, I didn't really know what to expect from their new lunch concept. Especially since I'm not into the whole \"poke\" bowl and sushi burrito fad. But this is NOT that. This is in a league of their own and just so well executed. The menu and amount of choices can be overwhelming, but you really don't need to go past the thoughtfully-curated bowls that are a treat for your taste buds. I've already been twice and I'm legitimately yearning to return. Also, I brought all my siblings (with all very different tastes) and everyone was extremely satisfied!"}
{"text":"If you like salad and healthier options of eats then come on down! I like all the options you get to choose here, but it also makes it a tough decisions because the cost can add up quick after using up all the free add ons. I like that the chicken tastes clean even the slow cooked beef that I had put on my bowl. The lady who made our food wasn't greedy with the ingredients either. We also tried the chicken sandwich (they use antibiotic free chicken) vegan brownie, and chocolate chip almond cookie. Man everything was delicious.

My wife and I left there feeling a bit more energized and full, especially this being our first meal of the day and all the greens gave us a lot of fiber to be full but not sluggish. I had to save my portion of the brownie till I got home because it's so good with cold almond milk. The cookie was also just great.

The workers here are very friendly and keep the shop clean and tidy, nothing is worse than eating nasty food in a dirty shop."}
{"text":"Locally owned. They have lots of choices, everything for everyone. Awesome spot for dine in or grab and go! Everything made from scratch! Simple yet delicious with healthy and fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"One of my go-to's for quick, fresh and healthy lunch or dinner. Great selection of salad/grain/protein bowls. Great portions, friendly service and nice price. Purple potato for the win! They rotate their house made sodas/waters which are delicious but their cucumber mint needs to be a staple!
Shout out to MJ for remembering my order and great customer service!"}
{"text":"A solid 4.5! Purple Potato is a great addition to Henderson. Fresh, healthy ingredients that make you feel good after eating there. No bloat, no sluggishness! 

You have choices from signature bowls/wraps, sandwiches and create your own custom bowl/ wrap. There are a plethora of proteins, toppings, umami toppings and dressings to choose from. We always go with a base of kale and quinoa, add wood ear mushrooms, curried cauliflower, roasted kabocha, pickled red onion, spicy garlic almonds and cucumber with seasoned tofu and portobello mushrooms with a sprinkle of nori on top and mix it all together with sesame orange miso dressing. We choose to go vegetarian but meat offerings include beef, chicken, pork, ahi tuna, Japanese yellowtail, shrimp, etc. 

Sometimes we get a sandwich...the chicken or hummus and falafel. Simple sandwiches but cooked /prepared well with tasty sauces and sprouted multigrain bread. Bonus is that the falafel is baked and not fried. 

Purple Potato is a healthy option at affordable prices. Pleasant, modern atmosphere and everyone is super friendly and welcoming.

Don't forget to try their breakfast items. My favorite is the Almond Berry porridge. And there are vegan brownies!"}
{"text":"Great spot for quick, healthy eats. Plenty of variety, with an array of fresh ingredients and great section of protein. Pick one of the premade salads or build your own. Several dressing options. I had the Umami with sesame orange miso dressing topped with shrimp. Portions are big and very filling. Got combo meal and didn't have room for my vegan chocolate brownie...took it to go. Lemonade selections we're refreshing and delicious. Unsweetened mango lime was my pick, tart and refreshing and it came with a bonus- free refills! Reasonable prices, definitely worth a visit to check it out! Restaurant occupancy is 61, best for parties of 2-4."}
{"text":"Tried Purple Potato for the first time today, and I will definitely be returning. Ordered the create your own bowl with the maple tofu and lemon Dijon dressing. Everything was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"A creative and healthy menu. Lots of options to create your own bowl. Had the falafel and hummus sandwhich. It had plenty of flavor but could have used more hummus. If the tables and trays were clean I'd give it a 5 star rating. When in the area I will check it out again."}
{"text":"Finally a restaurant that gives fast, wholesome, and healthy food as an option around town. The Yonaka Modern Japanese restaurant and Purple Potato share the same owner/chef, so it gave a little reassurance to me that the food was going to be of quality (and organic) ingredients. 

The setup is \"poke bar\" style, but with vegetables(as opposed to rice) and choices of protein and other toppings-seeds/nuts, cheese, dried fruit, dressings, etc. They also have sandwiches, wraps, and porridges/overnight oats, vegan desserts, and fresh juices. My favorite thing here is the almond berry porridge with purple potato butter, blueberry chia compote, almonds, mapled sunflower seeds, coconut flakes, and berries. 

Pricing for the bowls is $8-9 and then protein is an additional $2-4, so its a bit on the pricey side but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Very good food!! Great location..parking lot is a little confusing and crowded.. I would recommend to anybody looking for alternative food choiced"}
{"text":"I have heard about this place by a friend who frequently visits, I also have visited Yonaka for dinner per his recommendation also. This place is amazing!!! I wanted to try everything, so I ordered a bowl not even sure what the name was but it has apples and goat cheese(which I subed for another cheese) I decided to keep it simple and try the chicken since I heard it was good, he was right! Also I added bacon too to my order, wow. Already knew I loved the crispy Brussel sprouts and tried the sweet potato chips. Way too much food but it's all good. Highly recommended both the Purple Potato and Yonaka!"}
{"text":"Imagine a counter filled with delicious, healthy and fresh food that you get to use to create your own customized bowl of goodness. That's Purple Potato. There are unique ingredients and sauces and toppings that make each visit is different from the last. Every eater will be able to create their own perfect bowl. The staff is super helpful in understanding the options and creating your individualized meal. I love when eating well and healthy ate combined."}
{"text":"Amazing gem for anyone wanting to eat healthy!! I am on the whole 30 diets and so eating out can be difficult with feeling guilty. So many options, healthy and tasty! Seriously wish it was on my side of town! Forgot to take the photo before I started eating! So good."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today, the owner and staff greeted me promptly. They recommended the umami bowl and I fell in love with it. I also tried their purple potato pudding and that was amazing too. Can't wait to try the rest of their menu"}
{"text":"Amazing food. We had the falafel hummus sandwiches and 2 different pastries. They have a huge selection of vegan food and all the pastries are vegan . Also we were given a sample of the hot porridge and that was also amazing. Vegan or not go try this place out."}
{"text":"While casual readers of the blog probably think it's just 24/7 gluttony a simple look at dates will tell of someone who limits their dining out quite strategically, both personal and professional knowledge involved in a decision that has maintained over 100 lost pounds since 2003, thus it should come as no surprise that a concept such as Ramir Bolanos DeCastro's Purple Potato elicits great interest both as a health care advocate and someone who also enjoys eating really good Food.

Previously discussed mid-April, a hidden-in-plain-sight location at 10090 South Eastern Avenue discovered as a result of Chef DeCastro's collaborative dinner at CRAFTkitchen, it was having recently taken over coordination of lunches at work that catering was requested from the healthy eating  concept on Friday, the days of limp Salads from Rachel's Kitchen or BJ's Pizza now a thing  of the past as both diners and small businesses stand to benefit from a focus on supporting local.

Not a short distance to travel from a storefront on the opposite side of the Valley, a requested delivery time of 11:30am not met due to traffic with the driver finally signed-off just minutes to noon, it was in a mixture of excitement and occasional raised eyebrows that Staff entered the conference room to find a collection of Salads, Sandwiches and \"stuff with Seeds,\" the healthy eaters immediately diving into glistening cubes of Tuna while those more prone to Burger King for Breakfast turned their attention to Chicken on Multigrain Bread with creamy mouthfeel created not by Mayonnaise but by housemade Tarragon Dressing.

Typifying the new era of \"Quick Casual\" and healthy, an emerging demographic of diners who desire the choice to eat out while adhering  to their own dietary preferences, it was by request that Catering from Purple Potato allowed the utmost degree of customization, Proteins held separate from the Salads used to craft several 'bowls,' the Umami and Ali both entirely different yet equally delicious with the former beautifully balancing Cloud Ear Fungus against sweet Squash amidst Kale and Quinoa while the later placed fresh Baby Spinach amidst crunchy Jicama and Sunflower Seeds plus tender Tomatoes, Broccoli and Beets.

A far more fibrous and nutrient-dense meal than many have come to expect at an office frequently inundated with Cookies, Bagels and Donuts, the Roasted Chicken Breast and Beef made tangy with Sesame plus Soy both well suited to either Salad while spicy Chickpea Fritters were particularly enjoyable tossed amidst the Spinach whose zesty Dressing helped add a little moisture, it was again with skepticism that many eyeballed cups of \"why are they blue?\" Oats before taking a bite and marveling at the creamy base and natural sweetness, though it seems all were in agreement that Ramir's Apple Cinnamon Muffin with a core of Purple Potato Butter was the real winner in terms of Dessert, the fact that they were Vegan probably not even noticed by most but truly remarkable when taking into account the fact that they were nearly as good as the best-in-Las-Vegas Brownie tasted at Purple Potato last time.

****While the driver's late arrival posed an issue for some, the 11:30am start time part of the reason some businesses are excluded from many Reps' preferred caterers, it was with high praise from several Staff members that Purple Potato was welcomed to the Office, on going so far as to call it the best lunch he'd seen at any office in his thirty year career and even those who have deemed Café Rio or Earl of Sandwich 'good' in the past admitting that Purple Potato is a significant upgrade."}
{"text":"For those that are familiar with Yonaka, get ready for their spin-off specifically designed for lunch! Purple Potato is in the same establishment as Yonaka. It is essentially Purple Potato by day and Yonaka by night, which has it's good and bad points, I suppose. 

The flavor profile of Purple Potato is absolutely versatile. You have the utmost freedom to do whatever you want, create whatever you want, and eat however you want. There is savory options as well as sweeter options. For those watching their weight or trying to eat a little more healthy, all the calorie counts are listed with each ingredient you put in your bowl. For those who aren't watching their weight can just put rice in their bowl. You can make a bowl, you can make a salad, or even a combination of both! 

For your first time, the waitress will always suggest you to take one of their chef created bowls because as a first timer, you probably have no idea what is going on. So if you're one of the types to take forever to make a decision, the chef created bowls are perfect for you. Because if you were to make your own bowl, boy will it take a while for you to make a decision. I, on the other hand, did not like any of the chef bowl combinations so I created my own. I looked at the menu prior to coming to the establishment so that way most of my choices have already been made. 

I decided to go with organic arugula and baby spinach as my base, roasted Scottish salmon as my protein. and apple vinaigrette as my dressing. I skipped on getting extra dressings. For the toppings, you get to choose up to 10 but the first 4 toppings is on them. Anything more than 4, it'll be an extra $0.50 each for regular and $0.75 for premium toppings. For toppings, I went with gala apples, roasted beets, cherry tomatoes, grapes, and avocado with nori (seaweed) sprinkled on top. 

The salad comes out already tossed for you with your choice of protein on top. If you choose to have their house made bread, there will be a slice at the side of your bowl. 

Nothing prepared me for the first bite. It was extremely delicious. I mean, yeah, I've had salads before and I like to think I've had good ones before as well. But there's something about Purple Potato and how they execute their creations that make it all the more tastier. The roasted Scottish salmon was absolutely delicious. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned wonderfully. It actually was the perfect contrast to my fruity salad. 

We also tried their strawberry thyme agua fresca, which was quite refreshing. It wasn't too sweet or too strong in flavor. You can clearly taste the strawberry and thyme yet the thyme was not overwhelming. 

Overall, I definitely can't wait to try Purple Potato again. It is definitely worth a try. It just sucks that I can't have it for dinner unless I buy it before they close and wait an hour or two later to eat it :P 

Oh they also have a loyalty/stamp card. Buy 10 and get 1 free I think."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the wait was a lot longer than I felt necessary for a PB & J sandwich and a smoothie. Other than that the food was delicious and this was the first time I have craved a vegan smoothie!

A bit pricey, but I guess all these health food places are. I would suggest this place for any vegan, vegetarian or \"just trying to be healthy\" friends."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing ! 

After a long day of grocery shopping I stumbled upon this restaurant a few miles away from my house. Couldn't help but check this place out. I'm completely stunned by the way everything was presented.

Below the picture is the Umami Bowl with Lemon Herb Brown Rice, and Roasted Salmon with a complimentary wheat bread. 

For refreshers I ordered a Cranberry Ice Green Tea. Again. Refreshing af !"}
{"text":"Quick eats meets poke bowl meets get your greens on! 

Today I finally got to try Purple Potato and had a great first visit! The staff was super friendly to walk us through the menu and how it all works to ensure we were set for the first time! 

With a fresh array of veggies and proteins to choose from, I had to remember to start small since I knew I would be back again! I decided on the Umami bowl base with kabocha, kale, sesame miso dressing, umami noodles, and sprouts. I added chilled shrimp, which were a hefty size, as my protein topping (I initially wanted tofu or falafel but shrimp were calling my name!) the serving size was very generous and filling with nothing but whole food goodness filling my tummy. I decided to try the green tea lemonade which tasted more like jasmine tea lemonade - still awesome - and a vegan brownie as a treat to end my first visit. My friend who joined me did the same and we were both happily full from the goodness of Purple Potato! 

If you're looking for healthy eats with reasonable prices and fresh ingredients, check them out!"}
{"text":"Ordered off of Ubereats so didn't go inside but I am always supportive of a BYO place. You an choose between salad, soups, wraps, sushi/poke, sandwiches, etc. So many options to choose from it was nearly impossible.... but our food was delicious. The menu seems strange at first because it doesn't fall into any category and has some strange ingredients but the variety overshadows any doubt. Tons of vegan options. I would marinade myself in the chimichurri salad dressing."}
{"text":"Oh Man! This place was a diamond in the rough. I had a custom bulgogi sandwich that was so delicious I was tempted to order another. The staff was super nice and personable. The vegan brownie was ridiculous. I'm so ready for my next visit!!"}
{"text":"Congrats on great new spot. It's refreshing to know that there are good clean eats out here. Location is great food is even better. With a healthy selection of sandwiches and salads It was easy to make a choice. My fiancé had the smoked salmon egg sandwich and I had the Yona salad. Simple eats with great flavor. We also sampled the porridge so we will be back for breakfast too! 
The owner is hands on and friendly, thank you for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy and without feeling guilty! That's how food should be. Purple Potato does just that. With a variety of delicious Signature dishes to creating your own bowl or wrap. You can't go wrong here. Don't forget to take home a tasty muffin or try one of their creative drinks! My second time coming here and I plan to be a regular!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight and since I didn't want a bowl or wrap, the cute girl up in the front recommended the Smoked Salmon and Egg Sandwich! Delish!!! She also recommended the Vegan brownie which was also good as well! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and big portions. I barely finished half of it, and I can eat a decent amount of food. Workers were very helpful explaining everything. Got the umami bowl with raw salmon. So good! I love how they mix most of the ingredients together with the dressing first and then put the protein, avocado, and spiced nuts on top. I didn't have to make a mess stirring everything. Will probably switch out the kale for a different base next time, since kale has such a strong flavor. Maybe chickpeas or arugula or wild rice - so many choices!"}
{"text":"Well, hello there Purple Potato!! I see you.

The owners of Yanaka went and made themselves a fast casual spot, and it's been on my bookmark list for a while. Tucked on the corner of a very active parking lot/shopping center, it's certainly worth finding a parking space. You walk in and are greeted by a very gentle atmosphere. I love the neutral and natural colors of the space. Order at the counter and watch them make your creation. 

I added a chicken to my salad, which was juicy and full of flavor. I will say that I didn't eat my whole salad because there was a mix up on my order where they added goat cheese instead of the feta. Sadly, goat is my least favorite flavor on the planet, so I ate what chicken I could and dipped it in the hummus that was on the side. I let the management know, and they offered me a salad on them next time. I will happily enjoy another salad from them, but on my own dime. It's worth it, but I appreciate the gesture.

They had samples out of their porridge, and if you haven't had their purple potato butter, you need to. I want to buy jars of it.

While you're there, splurge and get a cookie. Their pastries are vegan and they all look amazing. I've only tried the ginger cookie, so far, and it was the perfect mix of chewy with a slight crunch on the exterior. 

Bravo. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, got the chicken sandwich and pretty much built my own bowl of salad most of the time.  Their ingredients are all lined up, covered for sanitation purposes and looks really fresh at all hours of the day.
I like the idea of being able to add toppings like boiled eggs that are not cut until it's ready, dried strips of seaweed, barbacoa, smoked salmon, sushi and much more. Oh, the options are endless and it's amazing here.  Get this, they have the best home made dressings and I tried at least 5 out of 10 of them before settling on a different one each time.
It's a family business, where the chef preps everything daily and it definitely shows. His wife is usually there to assist and they are a welcoming couple.  
We've been given free desserts on our first visit to welcome us and I even got a free treat on my birthday.  A lot of their desserts are vegan, which I can't tell, but as long as it's good, I don't discriminate.  The serving size is perfect and just around $2 for a pastry is not bad at all.  I really enjoyed the brownie, the crumble cake, the chocolate cookie, but even made with maple syrup it's a bit too sweet for me.  That doesn't stop me from finishing it though.  
On average, by the time I finish building my salad, it'll cost me $12 with an added protein.  For the quality of meats and freshness of their vegetables and toppings, it's totally worth it.  
They have some awesome mixture of agua fresca- from thyme and strawberry to pear and lemonade mixture, to unsweetened naturally flavored tea, it's no wonder why I'm hooked.  
This is a refreshing addition to Henderson with healthy and fresh options. Definitely 5 stars all the way!

{"text":"Clean, fresh ingredients, pretty pricey but a great alternative to most of the unhealthy options in the area. Staff are pleasant and I love the customizable options with proteins; it's friendly for omnivores, vegetarians and vegans."}
{"text":"Great healthy yet filling lunch. The flavors were great in the coco bowl and everything was super fresh! I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place today when I was in the area, and I decided to go in. I wasn't hungry, but I was curious. Since I had dinner plans already, I decided to get the cold berry porridge and eat it for breakfast tomorrow. It looked so good that when I got home, I had to sample it. It was amazing! I didn't really know what to expect as I've never had anything like it before, but I loved it. Five hours later, my boyfriend and I just finished it off for dessert after dinner. Guess I will need to go back soon to have one for breakfast!"}
