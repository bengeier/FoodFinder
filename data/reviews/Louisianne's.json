{"text":"Well after hearing positive reviews , my group of coworkers and I decided to try it out. We are from Mississippi  and Louisiana and I will say this was NOT southern/cajun/seafood/ anything.. very disappointed in the $30 duck and everyone else disliked the food. Will not be back."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars at all I would . It's apparently a pricier, upscale restaurant with zero high chairs. As per the restaurant its a place where mom's needs a night off without kids. Now I am being told where I can or cannot take my kids. Food was below par and under cooked. Only thing good was the soup. If you want to spend $100 plus go where the food is good and staff is more friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I headed out to Louisianne's on the recommendation of a couple of his friends. We were encouraged to make reservations as the couple noted how this place is frequently filled to capacity every night. 

Well, Sunday night it's not so. And that's when we went.

Louisianne's is located underground, and the atmosphere below is warm and inviting. To the left is the bar with the piano and stage for the jazz bands that play nearly every night. In front of and to the right are small, white-clothed tables. 

Our service was excellent. Because there happened to be so few people there that night, the host and the waitress were both quite talkative and welcoming. The meal was delicious (you don't need appetizers here - the entree portions are QUITE large). 

I highly recommend it and can't wait to go back for the nights of live jazz."}
{"text":"My husband took me here in our very first date (7years ago) and every year we make a visit. I am absolutely addicted to their crawfish cheesecake and my goodness the crab puffs are amazing. Every visit I contemplate getting a platter of the crab puffs for myself and no one else. The bartenders have always been outstanding with their recommendations and drink specials and extremely friendly when waiting for your table. I love the atmosphere and the waitresses are usually on point and keep our water glasses full which is my biggest pet peeve. Definitely make this a stop if you enjoy and intimate atmosphere with rich food. I am still keeping it 5 stars despite my one issue which is there has rarely (if any) been a menu change in the 7 years of me eating there. Their nightly/weekly specials --when available are delicious, too!"}
{"text":"Louisianne's has seared it's place inside of my restaurant experience. The food is so good, that every time my girlfriend and I consider going to any other restuarant, we would have to consider the huge opportunity cost of not going to Louisianne's.

The place is dungeon-esque, but not in a bad way. It's dimly lit, underground, but often times has a pianist setting the New Orleans mood.

The food is incredible. Every time we go there we try to get something different, and we're floored by how good the meals are, and how much of it you get. The appetizers were delicious (we've had the platter for two, and the pulled pork crepes), the soup we've had with our entrees were amazing each time, with an intense flavor.

Their specials change every time we've been there, and if they don't interest you, their regular menu is always exceptional. We've had the roasted shrimp, the tasso and shrimp fettucine, the maple-cured duck, the steak, the seafood au gratin, and each time not only did we get one delicious meal, but enough to have an amazing lunch the next day.

The only con I can give Louisianne's is that they give you so much good food that you can never get to the desserts. This restaurant is the one that my girlfriend and I benchmark all other restaurants by, and before we go out to eat anywhere else, we have to strongly consider the consequences of NOT going to Louisianne's."}
{"text":"I've been to many restaurants in Middleton, but this is by far my favorite, and for a number of reasons. The food was excellent: I had a scallop and shrimp special. The service was excellent: Seated promptly, waitress prompt, professional and spoke very clearly when it came to the specials. The atmosphere is unique: In the basement of a building, but you wouldn't think so when you're there. Piano player, Great Martini! So when you're in Middleton, I suggest you stop here! (And Marnie is correct on the raspberry vinaigrette dressing with actual raspberries in it!!)"}
{"text":"In Madison for the week for work and decided to try some take out Cajun food. I ordered the Tasso and shrimp Fettuccine and I was very satisfied. Smooth sauce and great ham. It came with a creole soup that was amazing. 

I did wish I chose to dine in instead of take-out because it looked like a beautiful place downstairs to bring a romantic date to.

{"text":"My husband & I have been coming to Louisianne's for years. Tonight we wanted a date night with great food and relaxation. We got it!
We started with a great Cabernet Sauvignon recommended by Gwen and a favorite appetizer- the barbecued shrimp. Delicious as always! Hubby had the zucchini bisque & I had the Louisianne's French Onion soup. My onion soup was absolutely delightful! Hubby enjoyed his bisque. I ordered the special of crawfish tails & shrimp with penne pasta & andouille sausage combined with a garlic cream sauce. It was fantastic! The crawfish tails were tender and flavorful- so good! I hope this dish gets put on the regular menu eventually. Hubby ordered the fresh fish - Hawaiian swordfish grilled with roasted potatoes and a spicy corn dish. He really enjoyed it.
We could hear the live music which added richly to the enjoyment of our evening.
Thank you to Gwen and to our excellent waitress, Maria!"}
{"text":"Be careful as you enter this place, the steps are steep as you are going in the basement. Also, the carpet on the steps is very dirty, makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like. 

Four of us had dinner and overall the food is good. Service a little slow but very friendly. The place is cramped and the music was loud, so it was difficult to have a conversation at the table. 

For the price of the meal you can do much better than this restaurant."}
{"text":"Tops: Ambiance, particularly on a cold winter night.  Wine list - well balanced and fairly priced.  Sitting at the bar listening to music - you could do it all night. 

Food: Good, but can be a bit over-rich at times and it is not cheap. Desserts are uber. 

Service: For me, it has always been good."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I love the ambiance, the food, and the drinks.  It's even better when they have a lounge singer in the background."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Definitely a good place to eat if it is your first time in Madison, WI."}
{"text":"We went here for my sister in law's birthday. I was anxious because my last time here was so unappealing, but this time was a whole different story! We ordered four appetizers to split and all of them were delicious. I had a steak which was cooked to perfection. The service was excellent. The wine they recommended was delicious. We split several desserts and they were delicious as well. I'm still on the fence about the place but our last time there was good enough that I will give it another chance to make my final decision."}
{"text":"Fun, warm, lively catacomb place, often with piano music. Food is always really good. I want to hang out here more."}
{"text":"Only been here a couple of times but the food is amazing. Very good. The restaurant is a bit loud though, and quite expensive, hard to go to often due to the cost."}
{"text":"Completely disgusting!  Best decision would have been to turn around and leave at the initial sight of the deplorably filthy carpeting on the stairs to the restautant!!   The carpet in the restaurant is equally filthy!  Makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like.  Totally bad exoerience, will NEVER return!"}
{"text":"I joined Kelly R on her anniversary dinner at Louisianne's (being her boyfriend), and had a wonderful time.

I almost walked by the door to the place, because it's placed oddly in a narrow alley, but once down there I loved the atmosphere. The stone walls and arched ceilings gave a solid but cozy feel, and the New Orleans jazz piped through warmed the dinning room right up.

I had the coffee roasted chicken with an orange, ricotta, and nut sauce, and it was amazing. I never thought such an odd combination would work, but it did. I tried Kelly's shrimp, and they were great but a bit spicy for my taste. My only regret was that there was too much food for me to eat it all."}
{"text":"If you like spicy drinks, try the Cajun Martini. Lots of nice offerings in this cozy place, but Cajun/Creole cuisine is their forte, especially the seafood. Romantic, subterranean dining room unlike anything else you'll find in Madison. Hard to believe you're in beautiful downtown Middleton."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at Louisianne's. We had reservations for dinner, but happened to be seated next to a rather loud group of men. Since the restaurant was completely full, we asked if we might be able to be seated in the bar area instead (which was much quieter). They quickly accomodated our request and we had an enjoyable conversation throughout dinner. The food was excellent and a musician softly played piano in the background. The service was prompt, helpful, and friendly. Terrific night out!"}
{"text":"Awesome decoration.. It's like you came 100 years back...Loved stuff mashrooms...and Hurricane drink"}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here and usually really like cajun food. What I got was a plate full of super-salty rice and beans. I couldn't finish it and left hungry. I'm hoping it was just a mistake. I'll give it another try one of these days."}
{"text":"Crazy good food, excellent wine list, text book waitstaff. Best atmosphere for date night!  Not good for kids. Make a reservation!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Louisianne's recently after we sold our condo and got a Middleton Chamber of Commerce gift certificate from our real estate agent (Leslie Blum, she's great!).

We wanted to use the opportunity to have a special date night and go somewhere a bit more upscale than we usually do. Having never been to Louisianne's in the 5 years that I've lived in Middleton, I suggested we try it out.

I give the atmosphere of this place a solid five stars. Although it has an rather bland looking storefront, the inside of the restaurant is anything but. You walk into Louisianne's and immediately head downstairs. It's all stone and looks like you're walking into a cool cave or something. It's dark, but there's a lot of ambiance. I've been to New Orleans, and it definitely has that sort of vibe to it. It's romantic, fun, and not what you'd expect from the outside. I felt like we were on vacation while we were there. Also, there was a live jazz band playing and they were really rocking. It was awesome!

We went at about 8pm on a Friday night had to wait about ten minutes for a table, which was fine. While we waited, we ordered drinks at the bar and watched the band. I had red wine, and my husband had Jameson on the rocks. 

We were seated and ordered the Pecan Crab Cakes as an appetizer. They were good, probably just 3 stars though, as they tasted a lot like other Midwestern crab cakes that I've had before. They were heavy on bread and light on crab...with a lot of Old Bay seasoning. Again, they weren't bad at all, but not spectacular.

Next, we ordered some more wine and our entrees (more on those in a minute).  We were given a choice of soup or salad with our entrees and we each ordered soup. They had two soups of the day: a shrimp -corn chowder (which I got), and a tomato-based pulled pork stew that was like chilli (which my husband had). Both soups were fantastic! Definitely 5 stars for the soup. 

I'll take a minute here to comment that I enjoy going to traditional restaurants from time to time, places where soup/salad and bread are included with your meal instead of everything being ala-cart. (It reminds me of dining in Wisconsin supper clubs as a child). By the way, the bread basket was delicious and was quickly replenished by the waitress after we ate all of the bread within 30 seconds of sitting down because it was warm and toasty (and served with soft butter) and we were starving! 

Onto the entrees! My husband absolutely LOVED his dish. He claims that it was possibly \"the best thing I've ever had in a restaurant\". He chose the Coffee Roasted Chicken, which featured a bed of (homemade) fettuccine topped with a coffee-crusted bone-in grilled chicken breast, in a \"hazelnut, orange, ricotta sauce\". I think there was spinach in it too. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the grilled chicken moist, and the sauce was rich and creamy. It almost reminded me of a Thai peanut sauce, but with hazelnuts instead. Although it sounded like something that could become cloyingly sweet, it was not. It had a nice subtle umami essence in addition to the sweetness. Delicious. 5 stars.

The reason that Louisianne's is not getting a five star review from me, however, is due to my entree, which I felt was very underwhelming. We don't eat pasta at home for health reasons, so I usually get it when we go somewhere nice as a special treat. I chose the tasso and shrimp fettuccine because it was homemade pasta, and because it featured authentic New Orleans style ingredients (for the unfamiliar, tasso is basically spicy ham). The shrimp and tasso pieces in my pasta were well-cooked, but they were sparse. The dish also featured mushrooms, and they were fabulous...probably the best part. However, the pasta was supposed to have a \"Creole mustard cream sauce\", and it didn't really. The sauce was very light, and had little flavor. It was kind of sad, because I was really hoping to be wowed and I wasn't. I'd say my item was probably 3 stars, and would have been awesome if only the sauce had been a bit more pronounced and flavorful. 

The service was adequate. Nothing remarkable in either a good or a bad way.

Summary: I'd definitely return. I think Lousianne's Etc. is a decently nice restaurant overall, and is great for special occasions. Their primary issue, from both my own experience as well as the reviews on Yelp, seems to be consistency. Some menu items are fabulous, and others are meh. The major problem with this is that Louisianne's  menu is at a price point where people only go occasionally...so the restaurant basically has one shot to impress, and if they fail at that, guests won't return for a second chance. I think this explains why the Yelp reviews for Louisianne's are so polarized."}
{"text":"Yelpers, you let me down! 

I was on my business trip to WI, and i was very excited about trying this restaurant!  boy, it was a huge disappointment.  

have crab puff pastry as appetizer.  this was pretty decent dish.  the puff pasty came out flaky, just how it should be.  i could taste the crab flavor and almond crisps. it was very delicious. 

I also ordered the lobster bisque.  bisque was on the salty side, but it was ok with the bread.  i wish i could have stopped my meal here....  

Everyone on yelp was raving about their raspberry sauce on the house salad.  so i ordered that just to try the raspberry dressing, and huge disappointment.  it came with this layer of oil, and not enough \"sauce\".  when i poured onto my salad it was just drenched in oil.  i didn't even eat the salad.  

I had the steak special of the night and it was not good at all!  the meat was over cooked charred (i like my meat medium rare), the rice was undercooked, it was crunch, and the sauce was not good at all, it did not compliment the dish.   i only ate the shrimp.  it was $35 dish i only picked shrimp from it

The service was soooooo slow that night.  usually i enjoy my meals like these but that night i wanted just GET OUT OF THERE! the server took forever to bring out my dishes and i was getting really impatient.  for the amount of time at was at the table, she didn't come by to check up on me when i needed anything.  ugh.  never again."}
{"text":"All our friends had raved about the food & ambiance, so my wife & I finally decided to try Louisianne's.  The decor is indeed cozy- like a nicely made-up cellar.  There was plenty of room at the bar so we sat there before our reservation time arrived.  Only two beers on tap, but both good local brews from Capital. 
Eventually sat at our table & perused the menu.  Found many appetizers that sounded really good (including one of the specials that night) so we decided on sharing 2 apps and one entree... seemed like a good way to try a few items without getting too much food.
App #1 (the special): gnocchi in a savory cream sauce with crawfish was very tasty.  Seemed a bit light in the gnocchi (I think there were 5 or 6) but made up for it in sauce.  Two thumbs way up.
App #2: mussels in cream sauce... I had asked about the size of the mussels ahead of time and was told they were medium to large.  They were in fact medium to small, which was a bit of a bummer because we probably would have gone with a different app had we known.  But the flavors were good & we enjoyed sopping up the sauce with the bread.  And the bread they serve is quite good.  Two thumbs up.
Entree: Crawfish Etouffe... I was excited to try this as I hadn't had etouffe in years.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  If you went to a friend's house for dinner and they served this you'd be psyched, but at an upscale Cajun restaurant for $20 you may be left underwhelmed.  Two thumbs halfway up.  The salad that came with was fresh mesclun greens, with a bleu cheese dressing that was chunky but bland.
Midway thru our meal the jazz combo started up and sounded really good- definitely added to the atmosphere.  For dessert we shared a slice of key lime pie... nice-tasting but no great shakes.  It seemed to be thickened with gelatin and I suppose I prefer mine to be creamier, plus it was lacking in zing, but only mildly.  Again, if your friend served it you'd rightfully congratulate them but for $6.50 it should be REALLY good.
Our server was very nice & professional.  Absolutely no complaints there.
The nicest surprise came with the bill- only $70... and that included 5 drinks.
We have concluded that the next time we go we'll sit in the bar area and have drinks & apps."}
{"text":"We decided to sit at the bar and have our dinner there so we could listen to the piano player.  We waited a very long time to place a drink order, while watching the bartender stand and converse with other patrons. Then, it was an even longer wait to order dinner.  (empty tables all over, so it wasn't due to being busy)  We weren't sure who was supposed to be taking care of us, the bartender or a waitress.   The bartender took our drink order after a long wait, and then after that, finally a waitress came by as asked,  \"I guess you want to hear our specials?\"  She took our order and we never saw her again.  Water came half way through our meal from the bartender.  Our empty plates sat on our table for 25 minutes.  We felt very unattended to and almost a bother to the staff.  The food is excellent, however, and that just makes it tolerable to go there.  It is not an inexpensive place to eat, and it feels like a place where you should have excellent service.  I got tired of trying to flag someone down all evening."}
{"text":"I love the bar at Louisianne's. The atmosphere of the establishment is pretty neat, like having dinner or a drink in the catacombs or in a grotto. I particularly like the brass topped bar for a quiet drink. 

Last time I was there for dinner I had the Tasso & Shrimp Fettuccine which was very good. In past visits I've had the Jambalaya and the Etoufee, both the Shrimp and Crawfish selections. One time the Etoufee was spiced a bit much for my taste (and I LIKE spicy) but the second time it was very good.

Menu selections that I have not yet tried that interest me are the Bouillabaisse and the Cordon Bleu."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink on Monday night. A few observations:
   Drinks: My martini and cosmopolitans were delicious. S. really enjoyed his whisky sour. Drinks were very good.
   Food: For an appetizer, we ordered the crab cakes. I had the Pecan-Encrusted Catfish and the seafood bisque, and S. had the pork entree and the pork and sweet potato soup. We were both very impressed. I don't even eat meat, but I tried S.'s pork entree and it was A M A Z I N G. And I can't say enough good things about the catfish. I was so glad to have some left over, which I ate cold the next morning!  
   Service: Our server was so, so wonderful. I wish I could remember his name. Young guy, dark hair, thin. He recommended essentially all of our food to us, and we were happy with all of it. The bartender also came by and checked to make sure I liked my cosmo (I wasn't sure I'd like it). She was quite friendly.

Will definitely go back the next time we are in Madison."}
{"text":"Crab puffs are to die for!!! So good!!! I have only been here a few times for soup and crab puffs - mainly because alot of items on the menu are spicy!!(not a huge fan of spice) the hostess is sooo nice!!! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Best place in the world, I cant endorse this shit enough. Best meal is as follows (although ive had other things here, all good, nothing touches this one)

App: Crawfish cheesecake, sounds weird but is best of Wisconsin and Louisiana at once. Cheese and crawfish. Done. 

Entree: Their special filet, basically take everything that is great and put it on a filet. Nothing more to say. Goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes makes this.

Desert: Chocolate creme brulee, exactly as it sounds, would choke a homeless person for this (wont be missed).

Live music also sometimes."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure they use the same white cream sauce as the base for all of their dishes. I would have preferred a lot less heavy sauce so the seasonings and flavors of the foods could come through better. Sometimes simple is better"}
{"text":"I saw Lousianne's on the news one night.  So I took my boyfriend there for our date night.  

We were extremely underdressed for the occasion.  A co-worker had told me it was a little fancier than casual but we went totally casual anyway.  Good news is, it had dim lightening.  We had a drink at the bar and were quickly seated.  I'm a vegetarian, so I tried a pasta dish while my boyfriend had steak.  We had the goat cheese appetizer, it was better than I expected.  It had a sauce to it that had a really unique taste to it.  The entrees were good, I wouldn't say the pasta was worth the price and I wish I would have tried the vegetarian jambalaya.  We topped off the meal with the White chocolate mousse  for dessert.  It was the best part of the whole meal, knocked my socks off.

I would recommend this place, especially to meat eaters.  
The service was great, our waitress was timely.  She checked in often and never hurried us to finish and leave."}
{"text":"Not knock your socks off but good. Atmosphere in the downstairs dining room is nice quiet. A good place to go with friends and have a conversation.  I had the escargot which was good -- could have had a little more garlic. Red beans & rice was especially good. Salad was average. For out of towners staying at the \"big box\" motels at the edge of town this place is way better than the chain restaurants around the motels and well worth the short walk into town (maybe not in winter)."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about Louisianne's. We had nothing but great service from start to finish. I chose this place to celebrate our one year anniversary. We were able to be seated close enough to the bar to hear the piano music in the background, but they had the speakers positioned so it wasn't distracting or impossible to have a conversation. I had a glass of the house Merlot. It was good, but not great, but I think it was an instance of I got what I paid for. I'm sure there are a lot of great wines to choose from, but I went with the least expensive option. We started with the crab puffs. Everyone else is right- these are amazing! So light, so flaky, so flavorful. For my entree, I had the pecan catfish with dirty rice. Amazing. Had some spice, but it enhanced the flavor of the dish without overpowering it. My date had the tasso and shrimp fettuccine and also enjoyed every bite that she had. We didn't finish our meals, but that was because we wanted to save room for dessert--white chocolate torte. A great way to finish the meal, it tasted like the inside of an Oreo cookie. 
The service was attentive without being overbearing. We never had to wait to have our water glasses filled. The pace of the meal was great as well. There was time between the appetizer, the salads and the main meal so you weren't sitting with 5 plates on your table of half-eaten food. 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant and completely unique, you won't find a place like this anywhere. This is Middleton's best kept secret for restaurants. Great portioning, a little high on the price, but what you should expect at a high end restaurant. Unique specials and tenured staff. Go for the crab cheese cake as your appetizer, you will not be disappointed. I challenge someone to find a more unique, quality oriented restaurant than this place in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Southern spices in the Midwest. 

When walking in to Lousianne's you feel like you're heading down into a wine cellar. Decor has a very intimate rustic feel. While waiting for your table you sit in the lounge bar area were smoking is allowed in a not very well ventilated area. The seafood was seasoned very well. Very large portions. Servers bring out your bread and some olive oil and vinegar in a neat 2 in 1 bottle that boggled our whole table of 8. Reasonably price at about $20 per person."}
{"text":"Just ok because my bar for New Orleans food is quite insurmountable!  But I give honest reviews.  Whoever is in the kitchen can season food like nobody's business!  It is great food.  Seafood was not fresh though and they really do not have Bread Pudding on the menu!  That tells me that the chef is not from Louisiana at all.  Prices are too high, way to high!  Jambalaya for $20!  Ridiculous really.  A pot of that for 10 people cost $20.   But if you want great atmosphere and good food that is just seasoned well, go.  Drinks are reasonable and service is fantastic."}
{"text":"In case you don't know, Louisianne's has started serving lunch, The good news is that it is inexpensive and delicious. I had a cup of shrimp bisque that was outstanding, and the grilled chicken po'boy tasted very fresh (the shredded romaine lettuce was much appreciated). The only bad news is the general ambience of the upstairs lunch area . . . rather dark and uninviting."}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  We had a reservation and were barely greeted. Sat down and our waiter seemed completely out of it - tried to take our menus before we had actually ordered. My husband mentioned it was my birthday and he didn't say anything. We got the app platter for 2 and it was below average, besides the crab puffs which were pretty good.
The table next to us finished their meals, paid, and left. We finished our wine. Another table came, ordered, and got their food. The waiter said \"it looks like we put in your ticket a little late, probably my fault, it will be out in a minute\". We said okay. The table next to us ate their entire meals, and our waiter was literally hiding in the kitchen to avoid telling us what was happening. Another waitress told the table next to us they had the same waiter and then took their orders saying he was \"held up in the kitchen\", pretty sure again avoiding us. We asked her for a status update and said \"did our waiter say our food wasn't put in?\" And she went on to explain how it was the salad person who messed up. We didn't really care who messed up, we just wanted someone to take some ownership and tell us when our food would be received. Meanwhile our waters were empty. We finally got our food and again, below average, especially for the cost.
We talked to the manager. They offered us a free dessert - honestly what most places would just give me for it being my birthday. Finally, she offered to take off our wine from our bill.
Food quality, cost, but most importantly service was terrible. Many better places you can go in Madison to spend the same or less for better food and much better service. They must get a good Middleton following or I have no idea how they stay in business."}
{"text":"I think they've changed their shrimp etouffe recipe as it does not seem as spicy as before.  Kinda tame."}
{"text":"Quiet, quaint and awesome. The place is tucked away and underground. Piano man in the bar area playing jazz and lounge tunes. Had escargot, wine and barracuda. At how many other places can you say you have all of those at once, AND underground. Zero! This place is good. Priced well for what you get too. Couldn't finish it all."}
{"text":"The moment you walk in you are transported into another time and place. They had live music that fit the scene, made the atmosphere, and stayed background enough to have a conversation - check it out Tuesdays through Saturdays.

Order the pecan catfish with the crawfish BBQ on top, aka \"Maria's special\". It sounds wacky but the pecans really go with the blackened catfish. The tasso and shrimp fettuccine - a combination of shrimp, smoked ham, and mustard cream sauce sounds like a questionable combination but it is soothing, hot soul food at its fanciest. Everything we ate had depth, richness, and finesse. If you are a soup snob, definitely get the soup over the salad option. Presentation was lacking but I don't think that's the point of soul food.  

Service is sassy but whole-hearted. We walked in without reservations at 7pm on a Friday and when we asked if we could sit at the bar we were told \"yeah, if you can find seats\".  We found a couple stools and ordered dinner at the bar. It isn't bend over backwards service, but they are real people and sometimes that's better. Maria, our bartender who's worked there 13 years, gave excellent food and drink recs and was really attentive despite the rush - she basically made our night. 

It's a great place to bring guests if you want to head off to a chill and unexpected place. Even better if you're prepared to stuff your faces with well-executed comfort food. Try the Sazerac if you want a stiff, sweet drink and the Hurricane if you want a fruity, refreshing beverage that punches like a Long Island. The crowd here is mature and casually well-dressed."}
{"text":"I grew up Cajun so I was skeptical about coming here.  This place is legit, from the gumbo, to étouffée, to  jambalaya.  Spot in Cajun my poppa would be proud."}
{"text":"Emeril Lagasse would have been disappointed. There was no Bam! during our visit to Louisianne's on 9/10/13.

The good: my wife's company, the wine list, the evening's piano player, the salad, and the crawfish corn chowder.

The bad: the thick, yellow, and salty cream sauce our mussels swam in and the worn out carpet on the stairs leading down to the restaurant.

The ugly:  The not so special blackened swordfish entrée with salty sides and the shrimp etouffee.  The classic Cajun dish was a generous amount of white rice with salty ketchup sauce.  :-("}
{"text":"Came here and sat at the bar. The bartender was an excellent server. I ordered the duck and it was delicious and juicy. I was surprised how well the sauce was for the vegetables and dirty rice.  There were other good choices on the menu and can see why this is a good place to come on a date. The only thing I would have nice to see a better decor effort, felt a little drab."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience! Ambience even better than what I would assume a normal
night would be since it was Fat Tuesday and they had a 4 piece jazz band.
Crawfish Cheesecake appetizer and Etoufee can't be missed! We will be back! L"}
{"text":"Good food, I would call it New Orleans inspired rather then real creole cooking. That said I have never had bad service or bad food here. It is really nice setting for a date or dinner out. Not too spicy to scare the native Wisconsin's, including my wife."}
{"text":"There was six of us that had dinner here last evening and we all had a wonderful experience.
We were warmly welcomed and were immediately seated.  We had reservations but we were 15 minutes late.
Service and food was great.  Catfish, beef, Cajun, pasta, duck all were prepared prefect."}
{"text":"Fantastic food here.  I really liked how the business is located in the basement.  It feels like a throwback to some other time.  I've had the chicken dish and also had a grouper special that was wonderful.  Really nice bar area too and sometimes there is someone playing piano."}
{"text":"Think upscale semi-authentic Luisiana with a romantic jazz overtone. The food is really quite great, and I would never pass up the catfish. It was blackened and served with a sauce that was indescribable. For a starter I got the stuffed mushrooms with tasty craw fish filling. For desert... yeah that wasn't going to happen I was stuffed! The total bill for me was $37, which was reasonable considering the quality, ambience and how friendly the service was.
The only missing star was that we had trouble finding our server as we were trying to pay our bill (it had already been dropped off but then he was gone!)"}
{"text":"This was my third time here - first time I would've given it 5 stars .. second time I was with a party of 8 and after 2-1/2 hours we had to leave before getting our entrees .. this time it seemed like the prices had gone up and the amount of seafood I received had noticeably diminished.  When I return to Madison, if a group suggested it I might return, but at this point I don't think I'd go out of my way to return.  Service was very good if a little slow - waitress was great, very personable and kept us informed on when we could expect each stage of our dinner."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant!  Beautiful place,  wonderful and attentive service, and the food.  So good.  We ordered the crab puffs to start. My entree was the Jambalaya with crawfish tails- spicy and delicious.  My husband ordered the Etouffee, which he commented tasted better with each bite. The dark chocolate creme brulee dessert was perfect."}
{"text":"Yum - I love Louisianne's. A bit fancy for every day, but the food is fantastic, the atmosphere in the restaurant is great and the service has always been good. Very delicious! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites when visiting the daughter in Madison. Great seafood,Great Atmosphere,Good entertainment on weekends and a really nice bar. This place is in a basement and has a cellar type atmosphere which I love. Drinks are also 5 star. Service is very good."}
{"text":"I also wanted to love this place so badly. I had very high hopes for it. The atmosphere is very nice and charming, however the food is very bland. If you know Cajun food, or food from the region in general, the flavor is big! I was very excited to try bouillabaisse but it fell so short on my palate. The flavor was so bland I may as well have been eating paper. The ingredients were not that fresh. It seemed as though it was one of those frozen meal-in-bags, minus the mussels. My husband got the duck which had a little more flavor but in general we were very let down. Might just keep it on the radar for lounging but not to eat. The prices were on point for what you'd THINK you were getting, but not at all getting."}
{"text":"Love some good Cajun food! This place has it. Downtown Middleton and what's cooler, it's underground. Walled by stone, down some winding steps you feel like you are dining in a cave! Plus they offer live music. It's great for couples or a date. Definitely a unique spot!"}
{"text":"If you are stranded in Middleton and have to choose one place to eat, go here. I suggest you sit at the bar if there is room and you can have a great conversation with the staff or clientele and may end up spending the night. Start with the pork crepes and go from there. I like the specials, but the catfish Louisianne is a mustardy treat. If you you get a steak ask for a crawfish topper.  This place is Creole not Cajun, so expect a bit of sweet with the heat, but I wouldn't call any of their dishes really spicey.  If it is Tuesday Friday or Saturday Johnny Chimes is playing and that is worth the trip by itself.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came here based upon Yelp reviews. I was expecting a dive place, like all the other cajun places I've been to, but that's not this place. Dark mood lighting in the basement of an old house. Small menu and very pricey. Not what I was expecting at all. I ordered the blackened catfish and a beer. The catfish and the jambalaya  were the two least expensive entrees in the low $20's per each. 

Pleasantly surprised by the large portion of grilled vegies and handmade mashed potatoes that came with the catfish. Amazing flavor and worth the money. The menu didn't mention the sides included. Friend ordered the jambalaya and let me try it. The blackened catfish was way better."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous!  Service and atmosphere was impeccable.  Our starter of (drawing a blank on name now...) Cajun Cheesecake was fantastic - a savory cheesecake served with a warm baguette, highly, highly recommend.  For the first time ever, we both ordered the same soup and entrees so a limited review. :) But the sweet potato seafood bisque was lovely with a perfectly balance of a light spice/heat to it.  We had the red snapper special that was served with lemon blue cheese potatoes that were absolutely devine.  We capped it with a dark chocolate creme brûlée and key lime pie that continued to impress.  I highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went again and it was AMAZING as usual. Went with a group of coworkers and we started out with escargot, crab puffs and stuffed mushrooms...YUM

For the entree's I had some pork masterpiece that was a featured dish and it was divine. For dessert I believe I had the dark chocolate creme brulee again. It was another great experience!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  It's a pricier dinner than I'd normally get, but the portion size and quality of the food was well worth it.  It's got great atmosphere in the basement of the building.  I'd definitely recommend it to others now that I've been there.  In fact, I didn't even know it existed until the day I went."}
{"text":"Good food but not authentic and quite overpriced. $38 for 1 entree and 1 dessert served by a snotty teenager? Really?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on a whim one night.  I was totally underwhelmed.

First of all, the service was REEEEEALLY slow.  from the appetizer on down, everything took forever to arrive.

The lemon parmesan artichoke hearts were delicious!  the flavors were all perfect.  That was my favorite part of the meal.  My salad was good.  My boyfriend didn't like his soup, so we traded.  The soup was just okay.

I ordered the maple cured duck, and I was surprised at how fatty and tough my duck was.  I really had a hard time eating it because the texture in my mouth made me kind of gag.  the veggies it came with were good, and the flavor of the duck was good.  I'm not normally one to order duck, and I really wished I didn't (I was torn about the coffee chicken.  I normally get chicken, but it seemed like an odd combo of flavors). My boyfriend got the seafood au gratin which was much better.

The best part was that I was so full on bread by the time my entree arrived that I didn't feel like so much of an ass asking for most of my meal to be put in a doggie bag.  I'd be willing to give this place another chance though."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a find!  Outside of the worn carpet on the stairs on the way down, this place is pretty awesome.  Very quaint, very, very quaint as you are literally underground.  I loved the feel of the place and the atmosphere.  The food did not disappointment either.  The escargot were absolutely perfect, perfect, one of the best I have yet to have and I have had them in many different place.  For my entree I went with the Crayfish etoufee and I am glad I did.  Excellent roux, plenty of crayfish, perfectly cooked rice.  Excellent overall.  I would give it 5 starts but the dessert menu is very, very pedestrian and not inspired.  Would go back again though and again."}
{"text":"We went for Valentine's Day and this was our first time. When I made our reservation, a man answered the phone and seemed to be annoyed with me and had a \"uncaring\" type of tone to his voice when answering my questions, it was a bit off-putting. When we got to the restaurant we were very excited about the decor and overall ambiance of the restaurant; it was very beautiful inside and we had a drink at the very beautiful copper bar before sitting down. After we were seated, a woman came to greet us, she was a bit off-putting as well, she didn't introduce herself and didn't explain the specials, she just handed us each a piece of paper with the special on it and we had to sort of figure it out ourselves. It took her a very long time to see if we were ready to order and even though it was a holiday, they were by no means swamped. We ordered the muscles as an appetizer, my boyfriend ordered the catfish and I ordered the seafood special. Everything was really delicious, the food was beautifully presented and I was really satisfied with it. Again, the waitress just didn't fit the ambiance of the restaurant, she didn't make eye contact, didn't smile, didn't offer me a refill on my drink was just unpleasant. Having been a waitress, I felt like she was either in a bad mood or didn't care to serve us well because we're you and she probably thought we weren't going to spend much. For desert we had was a lemon desert with raspberry sauce, it was absolutely delicious. After we paid, the hostesses said goodbye and we saw our waitress on the way out and she said goodbye without eye contact and walked past us, sort of rude. Overall the food was amazing, the restaurant is beautiful, and the ambiance is romantic, I'd give it a 10. As for the service, I wasn't impressed and I wish we had gotten a different server."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for her birthday.  We are both fans of cajun and creole food, New Orleans culture, and fine dining, so I assumed this would be an excellent choice.

It's tucked away downstairs and really does feel like a speakeasy in New Orleans.  I did not know there would be live jazz and it was very well respected local musicians which was very impressive.  Unfortunately there wasnt really anywhere to sit where you could still have a conversation at your table.  We ended up sitting by the kitchen and the temperature was very, very hot.  We considered leaving based on the temperature.

They have a large selection of appetizers and given that my wife LOVES crab and similar seafood, we tried the crawfish cheesecake, pecan crab cakes, and crab puffs.  The cheesecake was served with French bread (think crab bread if you're not familiar with this particular New Orleans treat) and my wife loved it.  I thought it was a little cheap tasting.  The crab cakes were a little dry but paired with a wet slaw that complimented them well.  The crab puffs were perfect.

For entrees we tried the crawfish etouffee and tasso and shrimp fettuccine.  We found them both to be bland compared to the actual New Orleans versions-- I actually believe that, in Madison, New Orleans Takeout has better etouffee and Angelo's has better cajun fettuccine.  The menu says they can be made hotter upon request but the issue wasnt just heat-- they were missing flavor.  Same with the included gumbo, it was quite bland.

For desserts we sampled the peanut butter pie, creme brulee, and mocha mousse torte.  They were all excellent although not particularly New Orleansy.  Perhaps we should have tried the pecan pie.

The service was excellent, our servers were kind and very attentive.

My wife says she would definitely come back.  I have mixed feelings.  I am more critical than her, but she's also more of a gourmet foodee than I-- I just know what I like.  

It was a memorable, affordable, quasi-fine dining experience.  There are some cajun/creole dishes here you cant find elsewhere in Madison, but plenty of others you can find better elsewhere in Madison."}
{"text":"I love literally everything about this place. For Westside location is extremely convenient and parking is always ample and for you. The location in the basement of the building makes it a really exciting place to come into and a cool place to dine. The food is wonderful, albeit very rich.  Loads of fun when they have live music, too!"}
{"text":"Exceptional food. Great environment it's under ground and has great stone walls. Nice tables with white cloth. The service is good, a consistent experience when you come here. We started with the escargot which is so delicious buttery flaky dough baked on top just really really good. I got the shrimp and scallops lemon pesto pasta and my mom got the Louisianne's catfish and a side of bacon mash potatoes. Yum. Dinners come with soup or salad both delicious has well I got the pepper corn dressing home made worth trying my mom got the black bean soup which I tried and it was super delicious not what I expected. Try the shrimp and scallops pasta you won't be disappointed. My moms fish was very good the creole mustard sauce was really nice compliment to the fish."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a wine cellar atmosphere where the restaurant feels like it's located in the basement. You're pretty much wrapped by brick walls and stuccoed ceiling making the temperature nice and cool and the acoustics of the piano playing music reverberates throughout the restaurant. 

Service is superb. She started with the daily specials and they have a great selection of wines. I had the gumbo for starters. I have been to New Orleans and I would say their gumbo came closed to how I remembered having it (maybe missing some okra). 

For my main course, I had the maple duck over rice.  The duck was cooked perfectly.  You judge the skills set of a chef by how they cook lamb, scallops, duck and rabbit. The only thing I would change in my dish is replace the green peppers with more of a squash and bring the salt down a notch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison. The shrimp etouffe makes think about New Orleans. Live jazz on weekends makes before & after dinner enjoyable. Worth finding in downtown Middleton"}
{"text":"Kind of hidden from the outside and the lighting is veryyy dim. Too dark for me. 

Came here for an early dinner so it was not busy and service was very attentive. 

Food was great - sautéed shrimp, seafood au gratin, and the lemon panna cotta!

Recommend the seafood options here and the sauce is delicious!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our visit to this restaurant however the waitress makes or breaks the evening.  More on that later.

We started at the bar and the bar tender was super cool.  He made a fantastic Sazerac, one of the oldest cocktails in the USA.  The four of us admired the decor of the establishment in addition to the fun columns throughout that separated the patrons making it a more private experience.  This place is in a basement  and the columns separate everyone, different than all the open air structures these days.

We had reservations and were seated about 10 minutes late however we were flexible.  The waitress was not very friendly and did not smile.  She was making the motions.  Likely tired because it was Badger Homecoming Saturday and they were busy.  We were celebrating a birthday and asked if they did anything special.  She said I don't know and can check.  When she came back she said if you buy a desert, we can put a candle in it.  What??  What restaurant does not do something for a birthday.  Oh well, move on...

Each of us DID enjoy our meal.  We had the Crawfish Cheesecake for appetizer.  It was like a cheesecake?  Different and good.  Two of us ordered separate specials and the other two ordered items off the menu.  None of us could finish and we enjoyed leftovers the next day.  The food was rich and heavy, comfort food like.  If you are on a diet you'd need to be selective because no calories are spared here.

In summary a happy waitress and a little birthday treat and this place would be through the roof!"}
{"text":"I decided, after much positive feedback from clients of mine(and a peek at my fellow yelpers reviews), to surprise my BF with dinner at Louisianne's for our third anniversary tonight. From the moment we walked in, I was really charmed. It has this cavernous feel(in a good, cozy romantic way--not a dank, moldy creepy way) with nice lighting and just all around nice ambiance. 

Our waitress was good, if a bit overzealous...and I loved the fact that she automatically brought me a small carafe of iced tea when she brought my filled glass. Nice. I'm a heavy(tea) drinker, so this was great! I enjoyed my shrimp and corn chowder, but I would have liked to have seen a bit more shrimp(but when is TOO MUCH shrimp ever possible). I also had roasted shrimp for my entree, which were delicious! Nice spicy flavor, with a ton of rosemary. I wasn't too impressed with the side of spinach and tomatoes, however. The Cabernet reduction that they came DOUSED in was a bit too rich. I wish it had been more of a glaze than a heavy sauce. No matter, I was too full to eat much of it anyhow. My boyfriend seemed surprised and delighted by the coffee roasted chicken with the orange-ricotta sauce( the bite I had was quite tasty). 

Also, I love the fact that they have live jazz on the piano tues-sat nights starting at 6pm(although tonight he started more like 6:30). It was really nice. We said that we would definitely go another night for drinks and appetizers(which looked tempting) in the bar/lounge area with friends."}
{"text":"Had a reservation at 7:15pm but when we arrived we were told we needed to wait 15 mins. That was annoying because that defeats the purpose of making a reservation. After that they found us a tiny table next to two large tables. The atmosphere was loud and cramped. 

The food however was great. I had the Bouillabaisse which felt like something from Louisiana because it had a thick earthy and spicy base. The seafood was fresh and it came with homemade fettuccine.  

If the atmosphere had been better I would make myself a regular."}
{"text":"It was really good, jazz player in bar made the atmosphere awesome for a very nice dinner with my girl. The food was great, crawfish cheesecake appetizer was spectacular. The roasted shrimp was awesome! And my duck was great also!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, would be a great place for a romantic date. Our server was friendly and good with recommendations. 
The food was great I really enjoyed the crawfish cheesecake, although it was not what I expected. It was a slice of crawfish flavored cream cheese spread, served with bread.
The entrees come with soup or salad, the gumbo was great!. I got the special which was a scallop and crab pasta dish. I got the hurricane as a drink and it was just right, not too sweet and just the right amount of alcohol.
Came here with a group of 10 and we had to wait a very long time on our food and even longer for them to split our checks. I'd suggest to only come with small groups."}
{"text":"Incredible food in a cozy and intimate dining room.

We dined during a snow storm, so we weren't able to experience a live piano performance; however, our first experience at Louisanne's was impressive and delectable.

We ordered the crab cheesecake appetizer (delicious!), followed by a special (blackened grouper) and lemon pesto shrimp and scallops.  Everything was perfectly prepared and absolutely exquisite. 

At first, we wondered why tables who had ordered after us were receiving their courses before us.  We hadn't finished our appetizer as we were saving room for our main courses.  Waiting and growing more hungry again, we finished the last bites of the appetizer.  Within seconds, our soup and salads arrived and we quickly realized what was happening (and so rarely happens in restaurants) - the staff was perfectly timing the firing and delivery of each course of our meals.  It's rare for service staff execute this well and Louisanne's nailed it.

Louisanne's was absolutely wonderful and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The blandness! I ordered the etoufee, expecting actual crawfish with the shells on looking back at me, and an exciting, spicy, roux-ey goodness. What I got was obviously frozen, thawed-out crawfish meat on top of a bed of rice with cornstarch-thickened \"sauce\" swimming in a pool of melted, grade B butter. I was pretty disappointed, my husband was really looking forward to it and it didn't please either of us.

Also, there was a hostess snafu at the front of the house and two parties wound up swearing at one another, really quite aggressively, right in front of our table. Something about a table that was \"supposed\" to go to one party going to the other. Not a good way to start a meal, and it could have been avoided with better customer service skills."}
{"text":"This place was great! Really great character inside with awesome live music (blues piano and acoustic guitar). The food was just as good as the vibe. I'm from Houston and we have a lot of great Cajun restaurants and this place had legit Cajun food."}
{"text":"Dined here recently with friends, and had an enjoyable experience, but not so great food. 
The pros:  
Inviting and cozy atmosphere. 
Really friendly and attentive service. 
Excellent live music. 
Great cocktails, ok wine list.

The cons:
The food was boring and inconsistent.  We had the artichoke hearts, crab puffs, and escargots for appetizers.  I didn't get the sense that the seafood was fresh.  Rather it was definitely of the frozen variety.  And everything was made with frozen puff pastry.  Even the escargot were covered with puff pastry. I think it was to cover for the frozen seafood?  Anyway, the appetizers reminded me of Pinterest recipes.  

A big red flag for me is when there are too many components in a dish.  That usually means that the ingredients aren't good enough to stand out on their own or the chef doesn't know how to edit.  I think we experienced a little of both.  

My husband and I both got the special. It was a blackened pork tenderloin with shrimp accompanied by mushrooms in a sherry sauce with red potatoes.  Each component sounded good.  However, the presentation and preparation was a train wreck.  

The tenderloin came on skewers.  What?  The shrimp were over cooked.  The meat and shrimp were served in a jumble of quartered red potatoes and mushrooms.  Everything was covered in some sort of Cajun seasoning that was reminiscent of Durkee or McCormick.  Then it was all topped with some sort of cornstarch thickened sherry sauce.  The whole thing tasted like it was straight off the Sysco truck  and reheated. 

One of our companions ordered the filet.  She let us have a taste, and the steak was good.  But it came with a buerre blanc dipping sauce.  I'm not sure what chef would pair buerre blanc with steak to begin with, but just like my meal, it was clear that the buerre blanc was another corn starch imposter.  

Dessert was a dark chocolate creme brûlée.  It was dry and pedestrian.  

Really I think this place deserves 2.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't do half stars, so I'll be generous.  Lousiannes clearly has a loyal customer base and is a popular place.  I would definitely go back for the cocktails and even the appetizers because the price point wasn't outrageous for all the puff pastry and I could still enjoy them now that I know what to expect.  

But I would not return for dinner.  If I'm going to spend $30 for an entree, I expect fresh ingredients, sauces made to order, and a chef that knows how to cook.  Madison has too many restaurants that offer far superior food to Lousiannes, and that's what will drive my future dining decisions."}
{"text":"Found this little gem of a place while in Madison last weekend.

The restaurant is in the basement of a building which you access through an outside stairwell on the side. A cheerful hostess greeted us as we descended the stairs into the restaurant. 

We were seated in an area where we couldn't see the piano, but we could hear it. The live music and singing were very soft and relaxing. The mood lighting is dark but warm, and along with the decor gives this place a nice, cozy, romantic feel.

We had an 8:30 pm dinner reservation, so most of the people already there were finishing up as we came in. So this made for a nice, quiet, charming evening after the day's noise and hustle.

I ordered the Crawfish Etouffee and my date ordered the Seafood Au Gratin. The Etouffee was SUPURB. Not too spicy, but just enough. Lots of marvelous flavor, and a good sized portion served on a plate surrounded by white rice. 

The Seafood Au Gratin was OUTSTANDING. The cheese sauce was very hearty and rich, served over linguini pasta. 

The food took a little on the long side to come out, but it was well worth the wait. The waitress was cheerful and attentive, and the manager stopped by to check on us, which is always appreciated. 

We walked out of there well-fed and very happy. If you're looking for a charming restaurant for a nice evening out, Louisianne's is the place."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance in this place.  Very small, low ceilings and great live jazz music.  I was a bit disappointed in my food, but my fiancé loved her coffee chicken--and she even hates coffee.  I'll certainly give this place another try."}
{"text":"Authentic exceptional culinary experience! I highly recommend the pecan catfish! It's a quaint little place with old world charm."}
{"text":"My Experience at Louisianne's was JUST OK. I have heard a lot of people talk about this place so I gave it a try. I went on a Friday night by myself and Sat at the Bar. Not really the type of place you can sit at the bar.  It's very small, there is no television, and hardly any stools. They have live music on the weekends so the place was very loud. My Bartender was the only one behind the bar and the restaurant was pretty busy. So, as you can imagine my service was slow. I had the crab puff pastry and BBQ Shrimp as an appetizer. The Crab Pastry was very good. The BBQ Shrimp however were not. I was surprised they left the shell on the shrimp when they serve it. For my main entree I had the Coffee Crusted Chicken and a half order of jambalaya. They wouldn't let me have jambalaya as a side so I had to order half a plate of it If i wanted to try it. The Chicken was very moist and flavorful.  A lot sweeter than I had anticipated but good. The jambalaya was very disappointing. Overall, I would say it was just ok."}
{"text":"The NOLA dinner vibe was really enjoyable with live jazz music as our background sound. The seafood au gratin was hearty, and the maple cured duck received the many positive comments among my friends who came with me. It is enlightening to see the escargot was serve with a pastry on top, although the escargot and the olive oil can be more flavorful. For some reason they flavor was not round and separated.

Service was smooth. Our waiter was very cognizant and immediately split the bill for items we shared. This is a thoughtful gesture, and we all appreciate it.

My tummy did not have room for desserts that night. Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"We were in the area and in the mood to explore which led us to Louisianne's.  

We were quite pleased with the atmosphere (think wine cellar and New Orleans) and the outstanding service.

The meal itself was pleasing but not spectacular.

Ordered the goat cheese appetizer, and coffee roasted chicken and maple cured duck, both with a salad.  The French bread that accompanied the cheese was good, credible but not to the level of noticeably great.  And that describes the rest."}
{"text":"One of my favorite dining experiences in the Madison area. The underground atmosphere at Louisianne's is quaint yet not unsophisticated; we went on the eve of a snowstorm, so the pianist didn't make it in to play--though I'm sure he would have made a nice dinnertime addition.

Service was friendly and efficient. Our lemon artichoke appetizer was excellent--akin to bruschetta, but minus the tomatoes and plus pine nuts and a decadent lemon-y parmesan topping. For an entree, I ordered the blackened catfish with spinach mashed potatoes, and wasn't disappointed... though I will say my fish was seasoned on the heavy side. I didn't mind the additional kick, but you may want to let the staff know if you don't like the sensation of blackened fire-breathing between bites.

I was also pleased with the wine selection. And really, how can you go wrong with the chocolate creme brulee for dessert? Thanks, Louisianne's, for a warm, inviting dinner--and for heating me up with enough cajun spice to temporarily make me forget how blustery it is outdoors!"}
{"text":"Terrific ambiance was coupled with an adequate menu that described Cajun bliss, but delivered spicy pasta... Full disclosure, their probably going to get another shot at making us believers..."}
{"text":"The raspberry vinaigrette salad dressing had actual raspberries in it. Ok. Just had to get that off my chest. The dressing surprised me and I'll go back for more than just that. 

We arrived on a Saturday night without a reservation.  I believe we took one of the last tables available until 9 or so. I would have opted for the bar if a table hadn't been available. There are a few high top tables that are seated in an area with live music.  The place is small and intimate. It's the perfect place for a first date. 

We started with the Lemon Parmesan Artichoke Hearts which were nothing like I expected but were rich and flavorful. We weren't terribly hungry so I ordered and appetizer for my entrée and my boyfriend ordered the special. I tried the Crawfish Cheesecake, which, is basically a cheese ball in the shape of a piece of cheesecake. It was tasty and would make the perfect appetizer for a table of four but I wouldn't recommended as a main entrée.

The special was the highlight of the meal. I couldn't repeat it if my life depended on it, but I heard the words: scallops, shrimp and sweet potato  ravioli, pecans, lime something and zucchini... I forgot about the rest of the menu entirely.  I'm not doing the plate any justice with this, but please trust me, it was delicious. The vegetables were perfectly cooked with a lime (something, slightly spicy but still let the veggies shine) sauce that complimented the sweet potato ravioli. Then there were scallops. It was one of those dishes that I couldn't comprehend. All I know is I am anxious to try more of what this chef has to offer."}
{"text":"After hearing great reviews of Louisianne's, my husband and I decided to give it a try.  We went for appetizers and drinks rather than a full meal.  We sat at the bar and had excellent service by the bartender.  When we first arrived it wasn't very crowded, but after 10 minutes the bar was packed with people. The atmosphere was cozy and very welcoming with the live piano music.

We had the \"combination for 2\" (crab puffs, barbecue shrimp, and stuffed mushrooms) and an order of the mussels for a total of $20.  The mussels were filling since they are in a cream sauce and served with yummy bread.  The combination plate was also excellent.  We were pleasantly full and enjoyed a nice bottle of wine for around $55.  

It is nice to see a high quality restaurant in Middleton!  We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I've brought business contacts and executives from my firm to Louisiannes'.  Always they have been impressed with the quality of the food, the ambiance of the facility and the attentiveness of the staff.  It compares well with top quality restaurants all over the world."}
{"text":"This review is overdue! I came here for my 25th Birthday with my husband back in September. Cajon/Creole cuisine is my absolute favorite. Unfortunately, Louisianne's was just subpar. The atmosphere gives off a \"New Orleans Vibe\" for someone who hasn't been there and the food is just mediocre. 

I'm giving three stars because the customer service is great! I'm not saying you shouldn't try this place, because I know it has potential."}
{"text":"My GOD what can I not say about this little joint... When I walked in and heard the  it took me back. I checked the reviews before I went and it had great feedback.  This place made me feel like I should be a food critic! The  and crawfish soup was heavenly,  but the tasso and  pasta surpassed any expectations. The people were nice and friendly. The environment was quite with dim  just super cozy. The FOOD my oh my I can still taste it. I was full but didn't want to leave this dish behind. The  was even delightful. 2 thumb's up... If I had more thumb's they could have them all!!"}
{"text":"Flavors are just ok. I had red pepper bouillabaisse with scallops,  mussels and blue crab. Crab was non-existant and tasted nothing like you would expect. Prices are slightly high considering portion size and mediocre flavor."}
{"text":"BEST.CREME.BRULEE.EVER!!

And the food, the piano bar, the service is ABSOLUTELY to die for.

Louisiannes is the kind of place that you can GENUINELY never go wrong.  It's in an underground cave, very \"Adams Family Values\" (Ok, isn't it bad that I compare it to a movie), their wine list is VERY extensive, and if you go at ~6ish, there's always the piano man, ready to delect you with a rendition of a bluesy jazzy tune...

While I think reservation is HIGHLY recommended (there's like 10 tables at MOST), it just so happens that everytime my husband and I go, we can get in.. Lucky us!!!

Seriously, by far one of the BEST restaurants in Madison (whoops Middleton)."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time two nights ago, for my birthday. Right off the bat, I was entranced by the atmosphere, even though it's a little small. It has a wonderful feeling of being in an upscale lounge/bar. There was a live pianist playing wonderful music. The hostess that night was extremely rude to me. I get that it was a fancy place, and I was in a dress, so it wasn't like I looked like some riffraff trying to start trouble. I told her my reservation name and she looked me up and down with an irritated look on her face, then answered the phone and talked for a bit, ignoring me. When she was done, she told me to follow her and sat me. That was the only negative thing about the place. I really hope someone speaks to her about her attitude towards customers, as she is the only reason this place didn't get 5 stars from me.

The food, however, was out of this world. Quite expensive, but worth every penny. I had the crawfish etouffee and devoured it, it was so amazing. The bread before dinner was fresh and delicious. The side salad that came with the meal was just a normal salad, nothing outstanding about it, but the dressing was really good. Lastly, I ordered the peanut butter pie for dessert, which was a fantastic end to a wonderful meal. I highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Service was polite and attentive (thank you James) and the food was wonderful. Had the blackened catfish and asked for it extra spicy and they did a superb job. Added the bbq crawfish topping and it was extraordinary! Dining companions special was yummy, I would have preferred a little more balsamic reduction for the shrimp, but flavor was still spot on. Ambiance is very nice. Ceiling are very low so it gets loud in there, but I can look past that. There was some soft, live jazz in the background that was nice. Will be back and can't wait to try the jambalaya!"}
{"text":"We met another couple here for dinner.  Love the ambiance, the smell, the courtesy of the staff.  It's all good.  But the food was especially excellent.  I ordered the Pecan Catfish.  Wow!!!  It was baked to perfection with darkened spices making it the perfect spiciness!!!  I loved it!  Veggies were fresh and crisp.  We had an excellent Pinot Grigio off the list.  The others ordered tenderloin cordon bleu, which was raved about.  There was a shrimp and pork loins special.  That got thumbs up and then another shrimp dish that came on a bed of fresh spinach, which I think she wished she had rice or pasta instead, but she did like it.  Love coming here and always recommend it to friends!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! Food and service were great. It's in an eclectic and romantic \"basement\" with unique and upscale ambiance. Food is excellent - pricey but what you would expect for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Can I give this place 6 stars? Amazing from start to finish. A+ for ambiance. Dim lighting and live piano with a rustic, underground feeling. A+ for service. Host seated us at our table of choice. Waitress was knowledgeable, quick, attentive and managed 6 tables in our area (one a party of 10) with grace. A+ for cleanliness. Not a smudge on glass or silverware. Crisp tablecloths and napkins. Bathroom was clean too. A+++ for food. We ordered the artichoke app. I could have left then and been happy it was that good. Warm fresh bread and butter. Entree were the coffee crusted chicken and beef tenderloin. Both amazing. The sauce on the chicken will leave you drooling for more. Dessert was the key lime pie and lemon panna cotta. Not over sweet. Good tartness. Even the bottled beer tasted better here. Will definitely return. Perfect for a romantic night out. Thanks Louisiannes!!!!"}
{"text":"Ooh Louisianne's I wanted so much to love you.  I'd read great reviews from others on here, in person, and had delayed my trip so the expectations were very high.  My wife and I settled on the Thursday before Valentine's Day for a visit.

The walk down to the old basement and comfortable environment was nice, definitely gives the place some charm.  It has just enough size to be accommodating but also personal, and that's the big win here in my opinion.

We ordered the Jambalaya and Maple Cured Duck, along with a sampler appetizer.  Our server was nice, but she seemed to be going through the motions and the service didn't feel very personal.  No huge slight on her, our service went along fairly routinely with no mishaps, but it wasn't the warmest experience I've had, especially considering we even said it was our first time there.  It also just felt way too casual for a nicer dinner spot.

The sampler was good, I would get it again if I come back.  The crab puffs had a nice creamy texture and buttery taste, and the stuffed mushrooms were a solid treat.  The Barbeque Shrimp wasn't anything special, but fine as the third leg.

As for the main courses, they were very underwhelming.  Honestly, our home stuff felt better.  Dishes didn't have a lot of flavor to them and seemed like they were just average all around from temperature, presentation, and taste.  My wife had requested the Jambalaya to be spicy (and it was supposed to be a spicy dish), but there wasn't any of that sensation to either of our palates.  I asked for hot sauce and was given Tabasco.  Sigh.  Isn't this a Cajun place?

The cream sauce that the duck was sitting in was a home run, and the accompanying Cajun gumbo soup as well.  Excellent flavor on both of those.  Unfortunately the duck was tough and bland otherwise.

Prices are pretty outrageous, but I don't fault them for that as we knew it coming into the experience.  Unfortunately we expected better quality for that cost, and didn't get what we hoped for.  Maybe we didn't order one of their big hitters, or maybe it was an off night, and I'm hoping for the latter.

Overall, tough sell for me in the future, but I may stroll back at some point down the road to give them a second shot"}
{"text":"This little place has been on our list for awhile and we finally made it last Friday night!  It was a cold windy night, so descending into a warm cozy basement space seemed to fit!  We were greeted by a cheery hostess who promptly seated us at a corner table.  Johnny Chimes was at the piano, which set a perfect tone for the evening.  Our waitress greeted us and we ordered up some fabulous food!

The shrimp and corn chowder was perfectly creamy, spicy, and loaded with shrimp.  Our entrees were the Etouffee with crawfish and the roasted shrimp.  The etouffee was deliciously spiced with a generous portion of crawfish that tasted like mini lobsters!  The roasted shrimp were outstandingly fresh and served over a bed of lightly wilted spinach with balsamic glazed onions and topped with parm...so fresh and delectable.

Friendly service, cozy space, outstanding cajun cuisine...we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We celebrated our anniversary here and truly enjoyed it.  Even though I was Yelping I opted not to take photos as it somehow didn't feel quite as appropriate in that environment.  Parking was plentiful as we parked in a lot less than a block away.  The restaurant is located in the basement of a lovely stone building and you can feel the history as you walk down into a dark, romantic environment.  A lovely table set by candlelight and lively live jazz music is played during dinner.  

The crab cakes were delightful.  Flaky and fresh, not imitation crab filled them along with almonds and a light cheese sauce.  I didn't want them to end, though I ordered the baked shrimp and they were just as fresh and succulent as well.  I rarely have the opportunity to deshell cooked shrimp and they were seasoned with just enough spice and placed on a delicious bed spinach tossed with a red sauce and tomatoes.  

Our drinks never had the chance to be empty and the service was pleasant and knowledgeable.  The house Chardonney was light with a hint of fruit.  The decor is Mardi Gras/New Orleans theme and I enjoyed seeing the voodoo doll next to our table adding to the allure and intrigue of the restaurant.  This was a very fun and lovely place to dine."}
{"text":"Very cool restaurant underground. They had live jazz music and the food was delicious. The etouffee with crawfish was great!"}
