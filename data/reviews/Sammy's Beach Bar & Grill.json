{"text":"The menu had more drinks on it then actual food options. I had the chicken sandwich and it was a good quality. I wasn't really a fan of the guacamole. The floor needs to be swept. Our waitress was friendly attentive and did a good job. Overall I gave this place four stars based upon other airport locations but it isn't four stars if it were outside the airport."}
{"text":"Horrible food. The burger, bun, and fries tasted like reheated leftovers. I usually share a meal with my companion, but even I looked at the paltry plate of food, which included a small stale burger, 8 French fries, and pineapple salsa that had no actual pineapples, and laughed aloud. Where were the hidden cameras to record the joke? $13 for the worst burger and tiniest portions. You will definitely have to drive faster than 55 past this dive!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst breakfast combined with poor service has made me avoid this place for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Five minutes to get a menu when they are not busy. Then told half the breakfast items are not available. Nachos please......\"no, we only serving breakfast\", it is just that you are not serving anything. Horrible."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent traveler so I'm no stranger to terrible airport food but this one takes slot #1 on my top five \"worst airport restaurants.\"  A tip for the chef: a hot dog bun, slice of kraft cheese, and a frozen (unusually thin) chicken patty does not constitute a passable sandwich.  I won't even get into how I was raped on the price for the luxury of having this \"gourmet\" sandwich wreck havoc on my insides before my five hour flight home!

The fries were cold and I also got a side of shredded iceberg lettuce with some ranch.... was that suppose to be a salad or imitation cole slaw?"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. 10 minutes just to get 2 sodas and water. Another 15+ for a margarita and it wasn't that crowded. I've eaten at the location in the Maui Airport and had a tad bit better service, but this one is definitely a place to avoid if you are anywhere near your flight time. Folks around us were either waiting for their check, waiting for their food/drinks or waiting for their order to get taken."}
{"text":"Good food at a decent price. It was not spectacular, but satisfactory. The bacon wasn't very good. Microwaved, I think. Service was good. The waitress was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"One star seems generous here. 1. Way over priced, 2. Horrible service, and 3. The food is pretty bad. You could hear the waiters fighting in the back, my soup was semi- warm (and you could tell that they warmed it in the microwave), and my shrimp ceviche was so bad that I didn't even finish it. Sad. Keep walking by to find something better."}
{"text":"Don't go here unless you sit at the bar and order drinks, and food that does not need to be cooked."}
{"text":"so bummed.........stopped in for a rum (Pirat) and Ginger before a flight.
I realize Pirat is a call Rum, but $14.50 for 1 cocktail!!!!!!!!!!!!
Made me feel used for sure, be reasonable.
Sammy I am sure you will say a vendor runs it at the airport, but after all it has your name on it."}
{"text":"If you want a hot dog bun with a crappy chicken breast on it and a side of cold fries for 12.95 this place is for you. 

If you can't tell. I was being sarcastic. This place is garbage."}
{"text":"I'll be brief: Slow service. Cold food. High prices. Long wait for service, food, and checkout. Dirty tables and floor.
Grilled chicken sandwich - not much chicken. The pickles were larger (and more flavorful) then chicken.
Stella beer was $10.80!"}
{"text":"This airport restaurant had a beach bar theme.   Pictures of Sammy Hagar, his autographed guitar, and surfboards contribute to the overall look and feel. 

The menu is that of flavors and preparedness from Baja California...or supposed to be, at least.

Decided to order the Shrimp Ceviche.  It should have just been called shrimp cocktail.  The shrimp was grilled and then marinated with lime. Real shrimp ceviche is not grilled and is prepared raw then \"cooked\" by the lime.  As you can imagine, I was eating jumbo shrimp with a rubbery texture.

Dean was the bartender that served me with my beer and food.  He appears to be this washed out Vegas bass player, ex-surfer, with a care free attitude that reflects his service.  Quite entertaining, actually.  Especially when he would talk smack about the other customers around the dining area with the other servers when they would come around fulfilling drink orders.  

As I had my bill in possession and laid down the corporate card...it probably took him about 10 minutes to pick it up.  Passed by it twice if I recall correctly.  C'mon buddy...I gotta catch that next flight.

Dean...I know you're too old to think of accomplishing any more goals at this point in your life, but please be considerate of what you say about others and be a little more tentative to the people you serve. 

Ambiance: beach
Food: bail out 
Service: beach bum

I should have went to Popeyes chicken across the way at the terminal."}
{"text":"If you like your steak prepared rare or medium rare don't visit this restuarant. They will only temp your steak medium due to health reasons. I guess that says something about the quality of their beef."}
{"text":"I've never written a review of anything...nothing has been worth my time...However this restaurant has changed all that.  The food looked amazing, vibrant colors...textures, HOWEVER, it really was bad.  Like eating a picture of a delicious meal.   I have never complained before...and normally I wouldnt...but this food was horrible, even for an airport.  There were 4 or 5 staff...about the same number of guests and the food tasted like it was made yesterday and put it in the cooler.  The hamburger bun was taken out of the cold room and the fries....so beautifully golden brown, could not have been cooked today...they were literally colder than the air around us.  The Bloody Mary, decent....14.00??   Yes I realize this is in an airport....  however so is McDonald's and I get the same food at everyone of them, so the \"airport\" arguement is just lame.  I assume that is why this restaurant is here, there would never be repeat business anywhere else.  I gave 1 star as  0 is not allowed.  In short, Starbucks is next door, walk over and get a 3.45 cent wrap,  at least they smile."}
{"text":"I get it,  it's an airport restaurant/bar.  Just don't!  The beer was cold, and that was the only plus."}
{"text":"Great food and service...server Jeff very attentive and friendly...I recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Very crowded.  The food was good, the staff was nice.  He nicely put 2 tables together so we could all fit.  Being in the airport, it made for a nice little get away from the airport feel."}
{"text":"Menu is too small. Food was average.i didnt like it ...i spent $50 and still left the table half full"}
{"text":"I don't even want to give this place 1 star. I have been here 4 times in the last month. The food sucks and the people that work there could care less. I will never go again. Sammy... take your name of this dump."}
{"text":"I don't expect a lot from airport food or drink. What I do expect from any establishment is an at least half friendly staff and a water without floaties.

Sammy Hagar - why?!"}
{"text":"I was sitting on dirty table and the burger didn't taste like real meat, the salad was not worth the high price."}
{"text":"HOW DO YOU SPELL ABYSMAL? Why doesn't Yelp has negative stars? Sammy's Beach Bar and Grill was the only sit down restaurant at our gate at the LV Airport and at the end of a great vacation, we wanted a nice place to sit down and have our last vacation meal.  Big--- big---- BIG MISTAKE! Just thinking about the meal is making my stomach feel queasy.  This review doesn't have anything to do with the prices at the restaurant ($13 for a sh*tty mixed drink that was mostly ice?) It's about the quality.  We tried what seemed like 2 pretty safety choices: a grilled chicken sandwich and a chicken quesadilla.  The chicken sandwich was served with a sad helping of fries topped with a sprinkling of shredded white cheese. Visually unappetizing (served on a triangular plastic plate in a haphazard way).  The chicken in both dishes tasted like something precooked you would buy in a bag at Sam's.  That's fine if you want convenience and you know what to expect.  Wendy's, Burger King, Popeye's (all choices in our gate that I WISHED we selected instead of Sammy's) can manage to serve a real piece of chicken that doesn't taste like it fell off a Cisco truck-- what's going on with Sammy's? Not only was the food substandard it ended up making me feel funny-in-the-tummy later.  The gift that keeps on giving.   Not only does my experience sour me on Sammy's restaurant(s) but I seriously don't think I'll be able to hear a Sammy Hagar or a Hagar Van Halen song without feeling sick.  Guess someone at Hagar, Inc. hasn't heard of branding."}
{"text":"Big Sammy Hagar fan. Waitress and food was decent but I watched Charles (he was clearing tables) act like a complete jerk when my friend accidentally bumped his tray of dirty dishes causing them to hit the floor. My friend apologized three times and he completely ignored him. Obviously Charles was having a bad day but this type of customer service deserves some attention. Sammy, if you're reading this, please give Charles a lesson in class and customer service. You're a class act and you don't need guys like this affecting business. I happily paid my tab and left an appropriate tip but I will not be visiting this airport restaurant again if I see Charles on the clock. Grow up man, you're embarrassing yourself."}
{"text":"Beyond awful. After an exhausting day at a job interview, I had forty minutes to get some food before my flight boarded, and literally spent the entire time waiting for an order that never came. To her credit, the server was genuinely apologetic but I could see how overworked, stressed and exhausted she was. Seems to me the #1 rule of being an airport food establishment is get the food the hell out to the tables quickly - people are catching planes and don't have time for slow service. Also, airport food prices are insane and this place is no exception - don't cheap out on your staff, have enough people to handle the busy shifts. Needless to say, will NOT be back."}
{"text":"I was hoping to sit back and relax after a hectic weekend in Vegas, especially since my flight was delayed. I was in the Southwest terminal and I believe it was the only non fast food option. 

Waitress was prompt to greet me and I began looking at the menu. The place is small because we are in an airport and I made the mistake of sitting near the door (it was seat yourself and the pickings were slim). I got hit several times by people and their luggage. 

The menu looked well enough and I decided to have something small. I picked an order chile lime wings. They arrived and it wasn't how I imagined. It said they were served on a Mexican salad but I didn't expect pickled cabbage and carrots as well as fresh spinach. The wings were also served with sour cream. I decided to give it a try but by wing three I realized they were still covered in feathers and that what I thought was just crunchy gristle on the second was actually feathers. I showed my waitress who apologized and offered to get me a new plate but I was too grossed out and declined. There was no manager on duty. The only reason they get 2 stars instead of 1 is because the waitress was so attentive."}
{"text":"Ordered drinks, waiter was in a rush to get us out moment we sat down. Had to send one drink back twice because there was something weird floating in the drink (dirty ice?) third time was not the charm, zero alcohol in drink. waiter new it was a BS drink because he didn't flinch when we told him there was nothing in the drink. 

Sammy would not be proud, he needs to drive faster than 55 to come back and get this place in order."}
{"text":"This place appealed to me because it was not fast food and offered a relaxed environment. The service was pretty good, but the food was really sad. 
I got the Cuban sandwich. It arrived luke warm and very greasy. The bread was also really heavy and a bit stale. The \"kicked up\" fries were cold and pretty bland.
On an even more subjective note, the music got worse as the meal wore on and I didn't hear a single Van Halen track. The final blow was the outrageous bill. I had no idea you could charge over $13 for the most flavorless weak Margarita in Vegas. Totally on me for not checking which is how I pretty much felt about the whole meal. Sadly, in the midst of a 15 hour travel day, I was too weary to care. It was still food after all and nobody punched me in the face, so there's always a silver lining."}
{"text":"Busted speakers, dirty floors, tables needing bused.  This a very bad experience.  I had hoped for something better; however, the staff was not engaged with customers.  Tables were not cleaned when cleared and customer sat among filth on the floor.  The nacho were a joke.  You can get better food and service at other locations in the airport."}
{"text":"Turns out you can't give 0 stars. Popped in on a layover for a drink and some grub. Saw a couple plates come out so I gave up on the grub but ordered a double Dewars and water. Try a single and water ;) Overpriced, of course, I expect this at the airport, but I have a word of advice. Order beer and drink out of the bottle. I watched the rude waitress wash about 100 glasses in the bar sinks. I would guess 3/4 of them skipped right past the sanitizer and some never hit the rinse sink either. Don't know why this matters? Imagine random strangers lips touching yours at the airport. Better yet, imagine 20 strangers lips touching yours. 

Beware and I hope Sammy's people read this one. Love you Sammy!"}
{"text":"The fries may as well have been plain. The drinks are overpriced. The only decent thing here was the service."}
{"text":"Sammy Hagar (whoever he is) needs to remove his name from this poor excuse of a bar & grill. The bacon was literally taken out if the Sugardale package and thrown onto a styrofoam plate and put into the microwave for 3 mins on high. My friend was give a condiment cup filed with two pieces of canned peaches and a rotten strawberry. I mean this must've been the strawberry that was in the back of the fridge that they forgot they bought 3 weeks ago. Then in the process of trying to putting it in the tiny little condiment cup, it dropped into the floor and rolled behind the fridge and collected all the Lint dirt and dust. The picked it up with their hands and put it in the little cup and served it. The French Toast looked messy and was bland and tasted like they drizzled juice from abrotten orange on it. In conclusion, don't bother going to this place. You can get better food at a homeless shelter! This place needs 0 stars!"}
{"text":"You are probably here wondering what the heck you just experienced right? At first you were thinking to yourself, \"man I sure am hungry\" next thing you know your $40 poorer and wondering why you're still starving but now your ass hurts. Stay away from this place if you know what's good for ya."}
{"text":"I know Airport places are generally overpriced but I think that for: a beer, a cocktail and a plate of nachos 45 dollar is way too much...
ah ...without mention that we waited almost half an hour...that's unacceptable on an airport location...we had to ask to put the nachos on the to go box...
The waitress was very kind but, I am sorry, if you can, don't go there!"}
{"text":"Prices are a little high, but it's Vegas. The meal was nothing spectacular and the Caborita was nothing special. The service was poor. Server never came back to refill drinks and never asked if I wanted another Caborita. Would not suggest to others."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and the places cute. But the food and drink were sub-par.  I had the chicken sandwich. The flavor of the components was very good, but the chicken itself was so poor, I had to dissect it with my knife.  It had a big vein of fat thru a tough piece of rubber chicken.

As bad as that was, I had to fish mint out of my drink that was so old it was black and slimy.

C'mon Sammie!  You're better than that.  Supply you restaurants with some quality products.  Too sad."}
{"text":"Fast and better with Han expected. I had chicken tacos and they were good. Friendly good service."}
{"text":"Terrible food and mediocre service. The nacho chips were from the bottom of the bag with a few whole ones on top to cover it up. The server did bring us another plate after we mentioned it. However it was a very small handful with now nacho cheese instead of melted cheese. The chicken fingers were what we expected but thank goodness we got the hot sauce on the side... My daughter said it tasted like a shoe smells. But worse were the fries that were as hard as a rock! Definitely not worth 39 bucks."}
{"text":"Food is good for a breakfast cafe in the airport. If you need to move quick they can have a meal to you in less than 10 minutes. I have eaten here many times and the place is consistent....okay food. A bit expensive but what do you expect in an airport."}
{"text":"This place is a terrible restaurant. Service was vary slow, i did not even get my meal after and hour and 4 other people in the restaurant. I had to go to another place to eat breakfast. Never eat here...ever."}
{"text":"Don't do it! We were ignored after we sat at a table so my husband went to the bar to get me a ice tea. The bartender refused to help him. When he told him we were sitting in the corner he said \"you're in the black hole I can't help you\". Go to the food court. The menu was very limited at this restaurant anyway. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast....not at all what we expected. Very disappointed in what we received. Wife got sick shortly after, but cannot say it was related. Was hoping for something much better quality."}
{"text":"Overpriced terrible airport food. Seriously how hard is it to make decent nachos. Las Vegas airport needs a re-haul in their food choices. Nice server though just order drinks."}
{"text":"What a dump!  My wife and I walked in to a server say \"we're not serving breakfast anymore\" since it was past 10AM (it was literally 10:02).  Which, by the way, is a great business model...stop serving breakfast at 10am in Las Vegas where everyone is hung over and so many people come in for breakfast that you actually have to make it a point to stop every patron that comes in to tell them specially that \"we stopped serving breakfast at 10am.\"  What a money maker!

Anyways, service was terrible at best.  I thought I was a t Dick's Last Resort because our waiter could not have been ruder.  Food was subpar and you got to pay $15 for it.  If you are in the Vegas airport go somewhere else!  I'm sure Sammy Hager would be rolling over in his grave...he's dead right?"}
{"text":"It is an airport restaurant... That being said, This is probably the worst one I've ever been too. I waited over an hour for my food, only to be brought out something completely different. Then I was told that the menu is changing tomorrow (10/14/2016) and they have nothing available on the current menu. The servers also seem to dislike their place of employment and are not very hospitable. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"The bisque is good. I can't say I've ever had bad bisque. Drinks are Hella expensive but what do you expect at an airport restaurant?"}
{"text":"Friendly service with a simple menu. 

We had breakfast at the airport in terminal C.
 Only place with hot, classic eggs plate.

Great tasty drink options.

Would go again. Colorful and fun decor.

Sammy Hagar owns it, so they run slideshows of his PR pics with many celebs, which is fun to watch. He's always smiling in them.

We sat at the counter and food came out in reasonable time. 

Cheers!

{"text":"I really don't expect much from airport food no matter who's name is on the menu. The omelette was acceptable, home fries were nasty and toast was dry...but coffee was hot and fresh, the sugar was \"in the raw\" and creamer was half&half. Service was good. Of course I've had better...but I have certainly had worse."}
{"text":"Nothing good. I get it is airport food. But avoid it. Poor service. Couldn't hear our guy and the place was empty.  Fries are soggy.  Chicken sandwich must have been pre made.  My grilled chicken was cold. Like refrigerator cold. And the crunchy stuff in the sand which was terrible. It was pitiful.  Avoid at all costs.  Go to Wendy's or jersey mikes."}

{"text":"After a cancellation and 3 delays we had some time on our hands and a thirst for a calming Bloody Mary. This place was the closest to our gate, so in we went. BIG MISTAKE!!!! Completely bland, I'm not even sure there was alcohol in them and with the tip, they were over $30 for 2 of them.  I know airport drinks are never a bargain. But seriously $15 for a friggin Bloody Mary. I only wish I had checked out Yelp before we went. Never again."}
{"text":"Yelp really needs to allow zero stars.  Airport food,  so not expecting a lot anyway  but wow!  Service was ridiculously slow.  I got fish tacos that were basically inedible.  My husband got dry wings and seafood \"bisque\".  The \"bisque\" was a pinkish red broth with some very suspect seafood....he sent it back.  My stepdaughter ordered shrimp tacos, just lettuce.  they put sour cream on it and didn't bring the correct order until we were done eating.  Both taco orders came with a side salad that was drenched in a horrible garlicky dressing.  I still have heartburn 15 hours later.  I have had heartburn twice in my life so this has been wonderful.  I had the pleasure of paying $60 for the worst food I have ever eaten.  Get sushi at a gas station - it will taste better and save you a fortune.  Health risks are comparable....."}
{"text":"High prices. Their \"Waving Margarita\" came with 0 tequila in it. Find a better place to eat in the airport."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Cabo Wabo when I'm in Cabo San Lucas, so I got excited that I could get a Wabo'Rita in the Las Vegas airport.  So, I decided to stop in for dinner.

I had a burger, and one drink.  My bill came to $30.  Add a 20% tip, and I was at $36 for dinner for one!

The food was ok, the drink was great, but it was all WAY OVERPRICED."}
{"text":"One of the worst places I have eaten. We went here because it was the only place open. The table was filthy and the waitress never offered to clean it. 

The food was just awful. I ordered shrimp tacos that consisted of plain shrimp, cheap salsa and some type of mayo in a plain tortilla...that's it.  My wife ordered a steak sandwich which came with an embarrassingly small piece of steak and a few veggies on an oversized bun. I ended up eating my daughter's plain grilled cheese because it was better than the tacos and she wouldn't touch it. 

The service was also lousy but I expected that since it was an airport. All this and they raped me for a $40 bill and made me listen to terrible Sammy Hagar music the whole time."}
{"text":"This place hit the spot. Flavorful nachos that we added bbq pulled pork to, a bisque with a lobster claw and chunks of crab meat, and drinks that took the edge off of flying.  Were they spectacular? No, but then again this is an airport. Prompt, friendly service made this an enjoyable pre-flight stop. The only complaint I have is that their drinks (and food to some extent) skew on the sweet side"}
{"text":"I wish I had read reviews before eating here. I just paid $17 with tip for the worst fish tacos ever. I was so desperate for something that wasn't a burger or a sandwich or pizza, so I was excited to see this on the menu. What I got was three tortillas straight out of the bag with the fish from the fish and chips they serve (more greasy batter than anything else) and a weird combo of corn, tomatoes, and chopped mango that tasted kind of off, with an edible chipotle sauce. Nothing else, and no sides. I wouldn't have posted, except that the food was also really expensive! Now my stomach hurts and I'm $17 poorer."}
{"text":"No stars.. crap for service.. crap for everything. I understand that I'm trapped in an airport on a two hour layover but I don't need to be exposed to rude wait staff and a horrid menu. For goodness sake make something g worthwhile.. oh and sorry for bringing my son with me on my travels.. we were told to sit In the area outside of the main dining area as that huge space is the bar. Signs are a feature! 

Oh... feel free to bring a broom to clean the floor for the staff because cleanings apparently do t happen until 9 when the place closes.

Good luck travelers that want a \"warm, prepared meal...\"

Good luck Sammy... you sold out for sure dude."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing, okay at best.  Food was cool (supposed to be at least warm I'd suspect).  Service was slow, and spotty.  Ordered Sam Adams, sent wrong beer cause \"they changed the wrong kegs downstairs\", couldn't get what I ordered, charged for it anyway?

Liked the decor, but since, food and service were close to poor, only worth 2 stars.  Hoped for better.  On the other hand it's airport food."}
{"text":"This place is very dirty, which is typical for a busy airport restaurant, but it was to the point where I was sort of uncomfortable. The food and service was actually decent though. We went for breakfast and I ordered the breakfast burrito which was okay. The coffee was great!"}
{"text":"Terrible from start to finish. 

I walked in and stood up front not knowing whether it was open seating or I needed to be sat. Two servers up front just looked at me until I asked if I could seat myself. After I sat down, my server (not knowing it at the time) came by about 3-4 minutes later and threw a couple napkins on the table. I assumed he was the busser and someone would come by to take my drink order. Then for the next 10 minutes, servers walking back and forth, actively not making eye contact. I finally got up and asked a random server if I could order. She just replied, \"yeah\".  Then she sent over my server who was short bald guy who initially threw the napkins on my table without saying anything earlier. I gave him my order then had to tell him I would like a glass of water as well. 

My burger and fries showed up not 5 minutes later. They showed up too fast. When I tasted my fries they were cold and my burger was just not good regardless of the fact that it had a crap ton of toppings on it. I felt as if it was an extra of something that was cooked a half hour earlier. I flagged down my server a minute later asking for ranch to mask the cold fries. By the time he came back with the ranch, I had already finished half my burger. I saw him just chatting with the cook in the kitchen window. The ranch tasted rancid so I didn't use it. The server didn't come by again until it finally dawned upon him to check on me 15 minutes later. He looked at my plate and said, \"well apparently everything is good\" since I finished most of it as I was starving from just getting off a very long flight. I then asked for my check. That was the quickest part of the entire experience -- him feeling the need to get me out of here as soon as possible even though the restaurant was dead!

I am a manager in the hospitality industry so I don't like to leave comments like these, but this definitely needs to be said. There is a serious lack of training here. It is for that reason I also don't like to complain because I have to listen to people complain all day at work about petty crap.

I would highly advise again eating here."}
{"text":"For airport food its a good option. The food does have decent flavor. It is so overpriced just like much of vegas. Burger was moist and well seasoned. Finding a seat can be tricky but not too bad. For what you would pay for a Nathan's hot dog or jersey mikes sub you might as well pay a lil extra for service and a more restaurant feel."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. Great small menu with a variety. Beach burger was filling with guacamole, cheese and bacon. 

Great ambiance with photos of Sammy Hagar, guitars and memorabilia. 

Would recommend to anyone for a good sit down fast meal in the LV airport."}
{"text":"The tattoo'd bartender is an absolute ass. He ridiculed the customers sitting across from me. He us rude and should not have a job in customer service!!"}
{"text":"Save your money and hit the Wendy's next door. I certainly wish I did.

This place is awful!  I rarely say that but it really was!  Our flight was delayed so we decided to hit up Sammy's for a quick meal.  There wasn't any signs so we seated ourselves.  Immediately we were approached saying that kids cannot sit in the bar area (I felt very far from the bar btw) and we had to sit upstairs.  Upstairs???  A foot away and up a 6 inch step up.  Um I beg to differ on the stairs comment.  But whatever we will go with it.  

We get seated and order a couple drinks.  We weren't super hungry so we shared the Chips with Guacamole and a Burger with fries.

First off, the chips were straight up obvious out of a bag...and cold and stale.  The salsa and guac had to have been from a jar because I couldn't imagine them making anything homemade here. Both totally bland but we ate about half of it.  Definitely a disappointment.  The burger was a \"build your own\" and we ordered it with carmelized onions $1.50 and jack cheese $1.50.  There was like two strings of onion (for that price?) but the burger was ok overall.  The fries were cold.  The best part was this coleslaw on the side that looked like they got it out of the gutter.  It was yellow-brownish and literally the serving was the size of a tablespoon.  We laughed at how small the serving size was...maybe they didn't want us to get us sick?!!  So gross.

The wine and the \"Can't Drive 55\" drink both $13+ were a bit overpriced.  Ya think?  I know I know-its airport mark ups.  What do you expect?  I wasn't picky - I was going on a mini vacay!

I think the whole time we were there we only heard one Sammy song.  I definitely will choose somewhere else the next time.  I've never been disappointed with anything I've gotten from the airport until now.  Sammmay!  This place is a hot mess.  A definite need for some tender loving care and some pride in your food.

BTW I have been to his Cabo Wabo on the strip and have always been happy with everything I've ordered there."}
{"text":"Great service.  Chicken sandwich was meh at best.  The chili was what I believe to be a bottle of BBQ sauce with a few beans mixed in.  They also aaa some velveta on top to make it real special.....  don't order the chili is all I am saying."}
{"text":"Unless you are only drinking beer or or desperate for less then sub par food and service you may want to walk around and find another place.  Bloody Mary undrinkable chicken tacos are made with large chicken tenders not cut up.  The waitress argues with people and belittles the management company who runs the pace."}
{"text":"Not bad for airport fare. Had the Pollo Bocadillo (not sure the spelling). A chicken breast sandwich, grilled with a lot of tasty toppings. Came with fries dusted with a hint of cheese. Felt like an accountant topped my fries, if you know what I mean. If you're going to cheese your fries, then cheese them!!! Came with small cup of avocado. I love avo. I'm not sure how a cup of avo finds it's way to a table in a frozen state, but mine did. Stil, the food was good. Much better than the other fast food choices nearby. Service was OK too.  I would order it again."}
{"text":"The burger was pretty good- the service was disappointing. Our waitress looked like a vegas dancer but had the attitude of a grumpy old bar maid. Tables are packed like sardines and the R&R music is great but a little too loud....the burger was tasty...the iced tea was cold:) The fries were meh...not very fresh & nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I sit here writing this review trying to remember my time here.  I was at Sammy's for a bachelor party and by this time, I was pretty gone.  I do remember having a pretty potent margarita and somebody ordered some nachos.  Having consumed distilled beverages for about 12 hours at this point, I can honestly say that if they put out stale chips and week old movie-cheese, I would have downed it all in a heartbeat.  The place was lit up like a Christmas tree and people seemed to be having a good time.  You should check it out, cause in Vegas, never know what is going to happen."}
{"text":"Walked in on 9/3/16 around 1:30pm to enjoy a lunch before a flight. The one waitress grunted a yes when we asked if we seat ourselves after she finally came over. (The sign was covered up to self seat).  We decided to try the bar area to order but when the bartender came over she snapped about food taking 25 min and turned around. We finally were able to order and were treated poorly again. We got up and left before our order was placed or cooked. Both very rude. Not one smile. Customer service and any ability to care about providing a good experience seems lacking here. Until their staff are educated on providing proper customer service I would definitely stay away. Sorry Mr. Haggar - it looked good from a distance."}
{"text":"Sorry Sammy... Not sure why you bother. I expect overpriced airport did but the quality of the food gets a big 0. The fish & chips were inedible.  Even the fries were a huge disappointment. How can you mess up fries? I applaud your trying to give back to the children in need with the profits but just can't recommend. Stick to music please."}
{"text":"If you like rotten fruit served in a dish with pieces of the sticker they didn't peel off all the way, then step right up! (See pic)
We ordered the  los cabos omelet and wow was it crappy. Spend your money at Starbucks next door instead."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! Very impressed with the service as well as the food! The poppin'dog was fantastic! We also tried the fish and chips, and the big beach  burger. All was as expected from the red rocker. Amazing!!! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Here we are at Sammy's at the Las Vegas airport. NBA finals are on and after 4 requests they finally turn the channel so we can watch!! Unbelievably rude to us! They won't turn down the music so we can hear! Don't go to Sammy's! They don't care about customer service!"}
{"text":"This is poor food and slow service even by airport standards. Had to wait for friends to arrive in Term C & this was the closest (best?) full service options.  The cheese fries were so cold the few pieces of grated cheese in them wouldn't even melt. I was seated next to the pick-up window & had to listen to every server talk trash about their customers. Just all around a poor experience.  If this was anywhere other than an airport, they wouldn't stay in business a month."}
{"text":"Used to be good.   Last two times bad.  Disappointing.   Guess I'll have to find somewhere else to eat at the airport."}
{"text":"So good!!

I got the quesadilla.  It was one of the best I've had. 

My husband got the Cuban sandwich. Not a crumb was left on his plate. His sandwich came with fries that had a really good seasoning on them. They were very tasty.

They were extremely busy the day we went, we still received excellent service and waited no longer than 8 minutes on our food."}
{"text":"Joined yelp just to serve humanity a warning. Sammy's beach bar & grill in Cleveland airport. Wow is it bad. Had low expectations - it's a bar/grill in an airport - but OMG you have to try hard to be this bad at making food. Do not get the Grilled chx sandwich. 1/4 of a tiny breast, a few fries and a micro cup (not really fair to fellow cups to put in the same category) of a slaw like substance. I just wanted some food to keep the stomach from grumbling on the flight home and was amazed at how awful food could be made. Small yes but bad at a level beyond words. Would have been better going to the Hudson news shop and eating play doh between 2 pieces of paper. 

No way Sammy, his relatives, friends, etc know his name is on this place. I think Eddie & Alex are behind this. They must be really mad at Hagar to go to the trouble of funding this place just to make Sammy look bad.

Only plus - Nice, attentive staff. Will try to post picture but obscenity laws may not allow such food brutality to be shown."}
{"text":"Meh is about it.  The server was super sweet or I'd probably have gone 1 star.  The sandwich was not at all as described in the menu.  It was basically cubes of cheap beef with cheese wiz on top.  not really what I was hoping for.  I have generally low expectations for airport food, which is sad because we frequent travelers deserve better I think, but for real.  This place is completely forgettable.  Except my sandwich was so bad I need to remember it the next time I'm there.  Go to Vino Volo instead.  Have some good food.  Pay a little more.  It's worth it!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and i hit sammy's spot before our flight back to Baltimore this week.  We were SUPER impressed!!!   The food was excellent!  The chips and guac, the grilled chicken salad.  and.......   the margarita's were top notch.   Service was quick, friendly and informative.  Very relaxing environment. The only issue we had was that there was a table sat the whole time we were there in front of the merch area.  We wanted to get a closer look, but couldn't.   Price...  it's definitely pricey..  VERY pricey (1 salad, 1 order of nachos, 4 margaritas = $85)..  BUT...  it's a sit-down restaurant in an airport, so i expected that."}
{"text":"Always stop in for breakfast and Bloody Mary's before our flight. The staff is friendly the food always good. Great music over the stereo."}
{"text":"Well, what are you gonna do.. it's Vegas prices + Airport prices so quite expensive
$15 for nachos with chicken and about $15 for a cheeseburger

The nachos were A-OK, cheese wiz, onions, black bean, guacamole, jalapenos and grilled chicken.

Fries were soggy and had some weird scary looking tasteless cheese on it. Burger was the driest burger I've had the displeasure of eating.. but soaked in ketchup it is edible.

Not that you have many choices -- but if you wanna pay for overpriced food maybe just go for the overpriced fast food joints (KFC/BK/Wendys)"}
{"text":"Don't eat here, go for the $8 slice of pizza down a little farther. No stars"}
{"text":"The worst airport food I've ever tasted. My husband and I stopped here before getting on the plane...big mistake! Our food came out cold...I mean cold like it had been sitting under a/c instead of a heat lamp. I ordered pineapple juice and a bacon and cheese omelet. The pineapple juice was HOT; toast, eggs, potatoes, bacon and cheese all COLD.... And the waitress pretended like she didn't know the food was cold. Anyways, I would not recommend this place for a drink or otherwise."}
{"text":"This place is not the best. They have a captive audience and they know it.

 The Sammy's beach Bar & Grill is in the Las Vegas International Airport behind the security checkpoint. I can't stand restaurants that put little effort into their service and food preparation. The service is poor to bad! The food was ok. 

On this visit they made our food wrong, which by itself isn't all that uncommon.  But what they did after they served it and we said something truly sets them apart from other restaurants..... They told us sorry, and they didn't offer to fix it and then charged us full price for it?! WTF? I am cool with paying for food I ordered, Shit the bill was only like $20 bucks. But if you make the food wrong, admit that the cooks made a mistake. Then say sorry we can't do anything for you, that just doesn't make any sense!? I was tired from the weekend in Vegas or I would have spoke with the manager. I Thought this was just bad form. How can you run a business like this? What happen to making things right?

In any other environment/location this type of service wouldn't be tolerated, but since they are at the airport with people who just need to eat and can't go anywhere else I guess it's acceptable. 

Sammy's shame on you. You should have more class than that!


Dino...)'("}
{"text":"Okay no prices on the menus should be a warning of what is to come.   Then they only selling beers in 23oz glasses, 2nd red light alert.    So you shouldn't be surprise that your beer cost $11.50.   

I understand gouging happens to the captive audience, but at least put prices so people can make choices"}
{"text":"Good staff and drinks. We ordered the nachos and they would have been good, however they were ice cold.. I wouldn't return for a quick snack before catching my plane.."}
{"text":"This was a cool place to hang while waiting for my flight to board. Sammy Hagar themed. The bartenders were engaging and fun. Drinks were reasonably priced and they had a full bar with a nice draft selection."}
{"text":"Note to Sammy:  Don't put your name on something that sucks.  Bad for the brand of a Hall of Fame rock star.

This place is fine for a drink, but I will never order food here again.  Limited menu, so you would think what they choose to prepare they would do well.  That was not the case with my meal.

Ordered tortilla soup first - tasted like it came straight out of a can at the grocery store.  The restaurant threw some semi-stale tortilla chips on the side.  For my entree, ordered the \"Beach Salad\" and added steak for six bucks.  That was a mistake.

Produce was not crisp and did not taste fresh.  Steak was cooked fine but was completely flavorless.  Clearly they put no effort into ensuring there is any taste whatsoever to their food.  They seem to serve everything with a \"chimicurri sauce\" which looks a bit like pesto, but also tastes like nothing.

I left 90% of the entree untouched.  My server said absolutely nothing when she picked it up - probably because I am not the first one to think the food stinks.

If you are starving, eat here.  If not, you might find a better option, but remember, this is the Cleveland airport."}
{"text":"Got a surprisingly good salad here while laid over, and the prices were only a little bit airport-jacked -- it wasn't nearly as expensive as I feared it would be.  Service was a little slow for us; but I heard the couple at the next table mention that their flight was in 40 minutes, and they got their meal pretty quickly, so don't hesitate to speak up if you've got a quick connection.  It's in the middle of the B concourse.  Seating is a little tight, and the music is too loud (to fit in with the Sammy Hagar Cabo-Wabo theme, I suppose.)  Still, one of the better choices if you're going to be hanging out at the airport for a while."}
{"text":"Holy sh## balls. $18 for for a margarita. Chips and guacamole tasteless. Fish tacos sweaty and bland. 
Save yourself some money and look elsewhere. Temperament of the servers matched the lack luster everything about this place."}
{"text":"Yuck yuck yuck. 
Processed and canned imitation food. 
Even the nachos took 15 minutes and they were made wrong. 
Then they had the nerve to try to charge me again to fix the order, which was wrong again. 
And it wasn't busy. 
Crazy bad. 
By the way  no gluten free food at all."}
{"text":"Horrible and expensive! 
Wanted some food before our flight and ordered the cheeseburger and \"Sammy's Wake up Screaming\" drink. Both tasted awful. The burger was bland - like frozen Walmart patties. The drink tasted watery (well-water). 
My husband ordered the Bloody Mary and chicken sandwich, AGAIN, 'puke-worthy'. 
Apparently, the only thing that tasted okay was my kid's hotdog and sprite.
Bill came to $78.00!!! 
NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"All fairness the servers here hustles... I like the seafood soup and the wine list they go by are the HMS corporate ones..."}
{"text":"Honestly, just never go here, choose anything else in the airport. Both the drinks and food are terrible and I can't believe Sammy Hagar is okay with his name being associated with this sorry execuse for an eating establishment. I know it sounds harsh but the food was just so spectacularly awful that it actually deserves it. (Our waitress was nice however, but still, just don't)"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Really overpriced. I had a burger and it was an ok burger. I really liked that hot sauce they have there. That's the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one. Service was very marginal. Long time on refills and they don't have ranch for your fries so don't ask. Go elsewhere and pay half as much for better food. Did I mention it's expensive?"}
{"text":"Stopped by today because we had a delayed flight, ordered their Red Rockin' Wings with the spicy BBQ sauce to start - actually pretty good. Nice BBQ flavor with a slight spice level to it, I would say they're mild/medium for the general population. So that means they're not spicy at all to me and I eat pretty spicy. 

My husband got the Sammy Big Beach Burger. Pretty good too. Nice crispy onion strings layered with guacamole, tomatoes, queso fresco and bacon. The bun was nice, soft and chewy. 

I got the Baja Quesadilla with Shrimp, pretty good too. Nice plump shrimp and delicious jalapeño crema. It was served with pico de gallo. 

The fries here are actually really good, it's not your traditional plain fries, they have a BBQ like seasoning on them. 

Our server was actually really nice too and timely. He was a little awkward but overall we enjoyed our visit. The price was high, my Golden Tiki drink was over $14. I do not recommend it at all. Not worth $14.

Enjoy and Good luck"}
{"text":"Bad greasy food and rude staff yelling at people coming in because they were closing. Be polite about it!"}
{"text":"Very expensive.  $54 for two bloody Mary's and two breakfast burritos.  The drinks were sour and the burritos were very bland. We will try the lounge not far from this place in the C concourse next time.  UPDATE--just went to their website to email them and let them know they have a problem. Also to encourage them to look at Yelp, a lot of negative experiences.  No way to contact them through email. It is all self promotion.  Sammy this, Sammy that. Talks about his passion for food. A joke."}
{"text":"Just sat for 20 minutes with one waitress just taking stuff off my table and another just ignoring him. Realize people have a bad day and I am trying to get their attention politely. But then finally lost my patience when one of them is chatting people up around me and just ignoring my request for attention! If you see this place, skip it unless if you want to lose your self respect. They are not interested in customers..."}
{"text":"I came here for a drink while waiting for my flight to board. The venue seemed very average for an airport lounge. The service was ok, and the drinks were reasonably priced. I would consider stopping in again if I'm flying out of Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Should have checked yelp reviews before sitting down. Truly an awful experience. Probably one of the WORST meals I've ever had all around. Terrible food and service. 

About the only thing the server got right was that I had placed an order. The French toast came with the cream cheese and nuts that I specifically asked be felt off so sent it back. To resolve the issue, the cook simply scrapped the cream cheese off and held onto it for another 10 minutes before neatly stacking the French toast in a pile so as to conceal what he just done. 

If I could, I would give this sorry excuse of a restaurant 0 stars."}
{"text":"Food was not great at all! Had the chicken  Caesar salad and the lettuce was brown and wilted. Wife had the carnitas and they taste like sloppy joes and it came with about 8 French fries. Mediocre service. Won't recommend for the price of the meal and quality of food."}
{"text":"Decent food, limited menu selection, slow service.  Pretty much what you'd expect from an airport restaurant but it's my go to joint when I'm flying out of Vegas."}
{"text":"After flying over 2 million miles in my career, I've had my fair share of bad airport food. Still,Mathis dump rates at the very top of the list as of today. I ordered the chicken sandwich. It was literally made with 1/4 breast of chicken. The salsa tasted rotten. The fries were cold.  Very deceptive from the crowds you see. Until you realize they are only drinking. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"My meal was actually ok. I got the caesar salad with steak. Steak was cooked to perfection. Now comes the one star explanation. The service was terrible. Tables were dirty. Servers were too busy in the back eating their lunches to clean the tables for incoming customers. Our server in particular, Jasmine, was rude and acted as though she didn't want to be there. She spoke 3 words to us, never refilled our glasses, and practically threw my food down in front of me. If you don't like your job, please don't work in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"I wish I'd done a Yelp review before stopping at Sammy's on the way home from Vegas.  

At first glance, the ambience was good and we were excited to sit down to breakfast prior to our flight.  We like to sit at the bar, because you usually get really good service there.  We enjoyed the slide show of Sammy Hagar and his friends showing on the tv screen over the bar.  At first it seemed ok - we had access to menus which were already on the counter... but then service took awhile.  We noticed that the bartender was a cocky, rude guy who was super excited about being himself - not impressed.  Once I finally got my coffee and drank it, I had to practically wave my arms frantically to try to get him to give me a refill.  The food was \"ok\", although my boyfriend didn't like his at all.  

We will not be going back to Sammy's."}
{"text":"I can't drive 55 ... but I want to drive 155 to get me out of this place as fast as possible. This place is a disaster.

Where to start? It just feels dirty. Nothing is cleaned, people leave, others sit down, a dirty rag might wipe the table off, might not. People hovering waiting for others to leave. Super cramped with people bumping you while you eat. Loud music (including much country music) that doesn't fit with the beach vibe. Servers seemingly disappearing. Food stacked up from the kitchen and sitting for as much as 10-15 minutes before being served.

And while we're talking food, let's take a minute to really study what is being served here. After a weekend of big fat food, I wanted something simple, like a chicken sandwich, but I still want tons of flavor. I see a grilled chicken sandwich on the menu that comes with guacamole spread, tomato, lettuce, chipotle crema, queso fresco, and crispy onions and I think to myself, \"Hey self, this has to be good, right?\"

Wrong. I ordered mine with no tomato and there was no tomato, which is a plus. But the lettuce was a single piece of romaine, there was no guacamole spread, no queso, and no crispy onions. So I was left with a sad little piece of bread with teeny tiny chicken, one piece of romaine, and a flavorless chipotle crema. No bueno.

Oh yeah, it was cold, too.

Worse yet were the Kicked Up Fries. These are french fries with queso and red chile spice. There was no flavor in these fries whatsoever and worse yet, they were cold as well.

So Sammy, I loved you back in the '80s, but your restaurant is a fail."}
{"text":"Even by airport standard this place is a complete joke.  I know its a money grab, but even still,  I cant believe the great Sammy Hagar would even put his name on this garbage.

The food is gross, the place doesnt feel clean, there are plastic utensils, its way over priced. 

Just grab a sandwich from a kiosk or eat on the plane or better yet, starve.  Any of these options are better than this complete dump."}
{"text":"A bit expensive, for sure.
If you reach before 10:30am, you get an option of only 4 items from their breakfast menu. 
Had the Low-Carb Bacon Omlet. Interesting cheesy taste. Flavourful & Filling. And yes, low carb as stated."}
{"text":"No place to sit, but we saw many tables dirty that needed to be bussed. Waited a long time.we finally just left."}
{"text":"Yea... This place is on par with other restaurants in the airport. Expect mediocre food at airport prices. My flight was unfortunately delayed by 3 hours, so we ended up eating an unwanted airport meal. I had the fish and chips ($15). The serving size was generous for one person. There were three pieces of fish and a load of fries. It was underwhelming. Greasy and bland. My friend ordered a salad and that was huge as well. So if you are unlucky and need to grab a bite to eat at this airport, you could probably split an entree with a friend as you're whiling the time away. There was not enough service to comment about it."}
{"text":"Service:
Very disappointed in the service here. We had been sitting for 20-25 minutes before being noticed. I was actually standing in line to order at the bar by the time our server came around. Drinks took about ten minutes to arrive and, although we immediately asked for our check, that took another 15 minutes. Pretty embarrassing for a restaurant that has a max capacity of 83 and was only halfway filled. 

Food and drink:
Our server immediately informed us that it would be at least 25 minutes before the food was ready. By immediately, I mean before even saying hello to us. I attempted to get a pomegranate mojito, but they were out of mint. We instead got Mai tais. 

Value:
Before tip, $33.50 for two mai tais. Not surprising for airport prices, but I would not order again."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Have been waiting for a chicken sandwich for 25 minutes. It came finally and is undercooked."}
{"text":"We came in for dinner with two people in wheel chairs. The female server yelled at us, loud enough for half of the place to hear, that she didn't have any room for wheel chairs. She then walked off.  Would have been a lot more professional if she had quietly explained what our seating options were for disabled persons. It was actually very embarrassing and several other people eating there got up from their tables and offered to make room for us. We ended up having to store the wheelchairs outside of the restaurant. Prices were expensive which we expected for the airport location but the portions small. The only vegetarian option for one person in our party was a chicken salad minus the chicken. Our server (the same one who had yelled at us) informed us that they can serve it without the chicken but it would cost the same price. Too afraid of her disposition to ask for her to if we could have it as a side dish for someone else. We have had breakfast here in the past which seemed pretty good."}
{"text":"I had the fish tacos with mango salsa. The fish was lightly battered and not over done. The salsa was delicious with just the right amount of heat. The waitress was exceptional.  A very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. This place shames the Red Rocker's name.
We ordered our drinks, then I left to find the restrooms. Despite having to trudge through half the terminal and back, I still got back to the table before our drinks did. Yeah, 2 drinks took 10 minutes in a restaurant with 2 bartenders, 4 servers, and maybe 8 customers.
My wife had ordered some nachos. 20 minutes later, we noticed food sitting in the window. Our server was busy chatting with the other servers in the corner of the restaurant. 
10 minutes later, I walked over to our server and told him to cancel our order. He tried to tell me that our food was ready to go out. I told him if it was the food that had been sitting in the window for 10 minutes, we weren't interested.

I can only assume there was no manager on duty because it was a slow night. Or perhaps the manager was among the staff ignoring the customers. Either way, this place needs to clean house.

Crappy service has ensured we will never try another Sammy's Beach Bar & Grill."}
{"text":"We had originally chosen another spot in which to grab a bite to eat before our flight, but when we saw the prices and the mediocre-looking platters, we high-tailed it out of there and headed over to Sammy's. When we sat down, we initially didn't realize that this was Sammy Hagar's place, but my husband was pleasantly surprised to learn where he was. A clock signed by the members of Chickenfoot adorns the doorway to the kitchen, and signed guitars from Michael Anthony and Sammy Hagar are displayed behind the bar. The menu had a very small selection of items, which was a turn off for me. Of course, this may just be an amended menu since it is in the airport. We went with the quesadillas and the chicken fingers with Mad Anthony's sauce and a side of the lime ranch sauce to try. My husband is a fan of ANYTHING spicy. As spicy as you can possibly get it, and it probably still won't be hot to him. Well here, he met his match. Mad Anthony's is made with pimentos and habanero chiles. Nooo thank you, but hubby was lovin' it. The quesadillas were tasty, the tortilla perfectly crispy, the bean sauce was fabulous, and the guac was absolutely out of this world. Overall, a pleasantly enjoyable experience, considering that it is airport food."}
{"text":"Bastards made me wait 25 minutes for 2 sunny-side eggs, didn't get them before the plane boarded (4 other ppl in restaurant) and then charged $5 for a glass of tomato juice"}
{"text":"Considering it's in the airport, the food was better than expected.  The wait staff is a bit overwhelmed and I asked for Water several times before we actually got it.  It still beats any fast food or pre-packaged food available at the airport."}
{"text":"Skip it. Unfriendly staff and food that is sub par. At least at the fast food spots you know what you're getting... They put cilantro on both our dishes too; on the fries and the chicken wings."}
{"text":"Airport cuisine hits an all-time? low at Sammy's Beach Bar & Grill. 

Nobody in their right mind would expect a 5-star experience in an airport, so allow me to preface this review with the fact that I? walked in hoping for anything north of a 2-star review out of Sammy's. Sadly, it seems that the worst of the worst was the goal and between the kitchen and service - Sammy's exceeded their own expectations and then some?. 

The idea is simple: carbon copy theft of Chili's and Applebee's airport restaurant location's menu and vibe with a bit of a surfing kitch in the interior decorations and entree titles. The prices are as expected (obscene), as is the level of service (atrocious). So far, so bad. 

...and it gets worse. 

I ordered the simple Cheeseburger which features an? all-beef? patty hockey puck nuked to well-done regardless of the temperature you ordered, wilted lettuce, a soft tomato slice, red onion, and pickles all between the stalest bun in the airport Burger game. One look at this miserable? specimen of one of America's favorite dishes and you know you are going to hate every minute with it. 

Worst Burger ever? That is a big title and although I can't recall worse in recent history - I can't allow Sammy's to \"win\" any title - even if it is worst Burger. 

Run away with your hands in the air while screaming."}
{"text":"If you're a traveler in a hurry then pass this one by, extremely slow service. Also don't expect a refill or second round of drinks, the servers are good at hiding in that  place. Food was below expectations, cold fries and  bland burger. Oh, and did I mention the waitress digging her fingernails into my back to scratch it, I did regret my choice of eatery."}
{"text":"First off, I have to say the service here is excellent. Multiple waitresses are watching each table and will get you in and out quickly. I think it's my mistake in ordering a salad from an airport restaurant mostly - but the beach salad was pretty bad. The corn was flavorless and it had a tiny amount of avocado/egg slices. The shrimp was really tasty, well marinated - but there were only 4. Might have better luck trying the shrimp tacos instead."}
{"text":"Prime example of how pathetic the Southwest Airlines LasVegas Terminal has no choices for a decent meal."}
{"text":"Really really bad. They even messed up bacon. I've never had bad bacon before. The French toast was just COATED in frosting. Made me sick to eat. 

Just...really surprisingly bad."}
{"text":"I fly out of McCarran International
I fly out about 25-30 times a year
I try to stop at Sammy'y each trip but timing is tough.
This time I took a later flight to Reno and had a great meal of seafood bisque and red wine.
It was still early so I got chips and Guacamole and of course red wine
I'm now ready to fly to Reno and the Shakespeare play"}
{"text":"Had the fish and chips as I waited for my flight out.  Good food and great service from my server, Lani.  She had a pleasant smile and went out of her way to make sure I wasn't rushed.  Asked me if I had enough to time before my flight...very courteous.  If you don't want the rush of fast food and have allowed enough time to relax before getting on the plane, this is a great place to eat, catch up on emails, and have a drink.  Full service bar too!"}
{"text":"Ok this might sound crazy but this place has THE best Cuban sandwich ever! We live in L.A. with some great Cuban restaurants that don't hold a candle to this joint. Also the fish tacos are pretty legit. Gonna have to fly southwest every time we make it out to sin city! Service is also quite lovely."}
{"text":"Horrible service...if you are out of eggs...just tell me!! Server brought wrong drinks and breakfast! Gheez...then I can her them complaining about be short on food...if you are out of something just explain...instead of offering something I am not going to get!"}
{"text":"Sammy's is one of the busier restaurants at the Vegas airport.  My gf and I had plenty of time to kill, which is the only reason I would recommend Sammy's.  Despite there being a buzzer to alert your waiter we waited about 15 minutes before our waiter came by.   We ordered coffee and mimosas.  These were the highlights and solid options if you are looking for good coffee.  The mimosas are 15 bucks a pop so definitely on the expensive side. But at least you know your getting good amount of alcohol as the sparkling wine comes in a bottle for you to pour yourself. For food, we ordered a croissant sandwich and the breakfast burrito.  The food came out pretty quick which is a plus (we were warned that food was taking 30 minutes or so do to back orders). But my egg burrito was pretty soggy from the guacamole and lacked flavor.  There aren't a lot of sit down options in the Vegas airport (At least the wing we were in) so Sammy's will do if you have time."}
{"text":"Horrible. Servers horrible. Bartenders lazy and disrespectful. Apparently the grill had caught on fire right before I sat down. I should have left then. Ordered a bottled beer. Had to take the cap off myself. OMG! Ordered nachos because the grill was down. Tortilla chips stale. The Cavs and Indians may be great but this place sucks. Should've checked this app first cause seems like nothing has changed."}
{"text":"Got the beach salad with portobello mushrooms. Comes with a lot of avocado, a tangy/lemony vinaigrette, jicama, corn salsa, hard boiled egg, and a tasty pico de gallo. They have drinks and dessert too. 

Price:

About $15 for the salad (not including tax/tip)

Service:

My waitress was nice and checked up on me.

Tip:

This restaurant is near Gate C 23. It closes earlier than the restaurants down by Gate C 14."}
{"text":"Two stars because I had sympathy for the waitress. Sammy, get your name off here. You're a rock star not a chef. Wait until you fly far away and eat there,not here.
I guess I should have just trusted my instincts and my fellow yelpers.
I was brave that day. It did not pay off.
I'll save you the food details.
JUST DON'T DO IT."}
{"text":"Find some where else to sit and eat prior to your flight. I have tried it twice thinking maybe their lunch would be better than their breakfast but it was all terrible"}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars, I would. 

This was the only place with open tables when I got off a long flight and was just looking for a place to sit down. 

I have seen better food come out of a college dorm microwave. Which is probably where most of this food comes from too, because though there is a window into a semi-open kitchen, there are no aromas of anything cooking, no sounds of sizzling, not even the ubiquitous scent of fryer oil in a place that has french fries on their menu. 

Everything comes out on microwave safe dishes, as well.... suspect, right? 

I split some nachos (tostitos style chips with shredded mexi-mix cheese barely melted on top), and a burger (uniform grey color throughout the 'beef' patty, and bacon that had obviously come out of a bag, pre-cooked). 

My traveling companion and were starving, but we couldn't finish anything. And due to the tepid temperature of everything on the table, we began to wonder if we might get sick later. The only thing that was any good on our table was the cokes. 

This place should be torn out of the airport.  It's a form of biological war-fare."}
{"text":"Sammy Hagar cooks?  Yes he does and he even has a cookbook published.  I learned of this reading French Laundry's magazine \"Finesse\" featuring chicken.

We came here for breakfast before our flight from LAS terminal C.  The bacon and cheese omelet was actually pretty good!  Smoky flavors from the bacon, and I liked the liberal use of fried onions to add lots of flavor (4 stars).  The French Toast had blueberries and all and was just OK (3 stars), but that side of grilled sausage was actually pretty decent and was a step beyond the frozen stuff at say, McDs.

Service was quick and efficient."}
{"text":"After looking at all my options, I decided to go to Sammy's. 

The service was exceptional. I was immediately greeted, and the bar tender was awesome with refilling my drink, and taking my order in a timely manner.

I ordered a breakfast burrito, which was average tasting. I can't say it was the best, or worst I've ever had.

For being in the airport, I felt the price was pretty reasonable.

Next time I'm at the airport, I may chose a different option. Only to compare with the experience I had.

Would I eat here again? Yes! 

The food wasn't horrible, clean and inviting atmosphere, and great service. 

Had the food been a little better, and the price been a little lower.... I would have given them 4 or 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food is good and the people are friendly but it is way to expensive. Mix drinks are 15 dollars. Beer on tap are 9 dollars. They don't seem to dust very often. The walls and ledges are covered in dust. The floor is not swept very often. What can you do? Once you get to the airport your fucked."}
{"text":"2nd time stopping in here.  Last time the service was friendly, this time the lady behind the bar is not even remotely friendly.  What a shame cause this will ruin what is otherwise a nice place for others coming in for first time"}
{"text":"Typical bar & grill type fare, but here you will be entertained/mystified by a never-ending rotating slideshow of images of the great Sammy Hagar, from his solo days to Van Halen to his slow melt into obscurity, lending his name to generic restaurants around the globe Guy Fieri-style.  Burgers, wings, sandwiches, quesadillas.  The sole salad choice is of the Southwestern chicken variety.  Vegas hangover food while you wait for your flight, and nothing more.  The service is decent and they have a full bar.
My traveling mate had a Bloody Mary and I enjoyed a mimosa; I did not enjoy dropping $30 for those two items."}
{"text":"My friends and I ate here while waiting for our flight.  I had some chili fries while everyone else had burgers.  

I'll start with the chili fries.  They're made with waffle fries and beef.  Someone doesn't know what chili is.  The cheese was sparse and there was a smattering of sour cream on top.  All of this came together to form the worst chili fries I've ever eaten.  

The burgers were about as good.  The buns were hard and my friends had to request more which didn't come out much better.  The cheese was congealed and the burgers came with bacon, which they didn't order.  The waiter's response?  \"Oh well, at least you don't have to pay for it.\"

If only we all could have been so lucky."}
{"text":"Went there on a Wed. around 5:00 pm.  Even before we sat down, the waitress said \"before you get too comfortable, we are out of chicken and fish\"  Ordered a burger ($12.00) Beach Nachos (11.00), a Bud Light ($6.50)  and a coke ($3.00)  You could tell the waitress hated being there.  Don't know what day their food is delivered, but that was extremely poor planning on the manager.  never again"}
{"text":"Probably the worst restaurant I have ever been too. The kitchen doesn't understand what the words \"medium rare\" or \"over easy\" mean. Everything is overpriced for the quality of ingredients and service. The one positive? Guacamole is fuego!"}
{"text":"It's pretty decent for an airport. The food was so so, the drinks were ok. Service was fine and friendly. Prices were as expected in an airport."}
{"text":"This place was fun.  I had pork tacos and they came with a tasty avocado cream.  The waitress Ruthette was funny and fast.  Perfect for a airport.  I would come back here to eat.  The prices unfortunately were airport prices and my virgin Bloody Mary was disgusting."}
{"text":"Danger Will Rogers, Danger. Read the other reviews. They are spot on. Sorry Sammy. Time to reinvent your restaurant."}
{"text":"Well... this is what it is!   Its fast place to grab a fast foodie kinda snack.  I think I figured out what to order for yumminess here.

A Bowl of Chili
Side of Chips to Dip in Chili
and we ordered Nachos
Modela Beer

BTW - Our server Georgina did a nice job!"}
{"text":"Blah overpriced airport food...how can you mess up a quesadilla and salad??  Better stick to the tequila Sammy!"}
{"text":"Holy shit! Just left there and I've never been so frusterated in my entire life. If I could give a zero I would. My mother and I sat there for 15 minutes watching our food sit in the window....took 20 minutes to get her wine...so finally...I went up and got everything myself.  All of the waitresses stand around and ignore the customers and refuse to help eachother run food...fill drinks...etc. Finally I ran my own food and the chicken sandwich was okay but I've had better burgers from mcdonalds! Not a fan!  Wouldn't recommend it!"}
{"text":"Sammy's restaurant sucks!  Tasted like bland food from a can.  Worst chips and guac ever!  Worst hamburger ever!  Do not eat at Sammy's if you have any pride."}
{"text":"Didn't get served for the 20 minutes I sat at the table, the menu is very short and overpriced for what it described although I couldn't speak of the quality due to not getting served"}
{"text":"Below average food. It is supposed to be USA Today's 10 best readers' choice for the best airport bar restaurant atmosphere category. Well, I find that a joke. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and the chicken was very cold. I asked if it wa supposed to be cold and she said no. It came with fries and the fries were swimming in oil. Well, the server was nice enough."}
{"text":"Good food. Rotten service. People are busy, need to get in and out. I don't need to know how harried you are. Refill my soda! Plus, you don't even have that many tables.
Speaking of tables, you need to clear them off-people are waiting to sit down.
But, your food is good."}
{"text":"travelers do not purchase anything here. if you buy one drink for $8 they will charge your card for $160 because they know you will be leaving soon"}
{"text":"Terrible, don't waste your time, the food is  terrible the tables are dirty and disgusting.  The menu's are stained and waterlogged the waitstaff is slow. I travel all over the world for business full-time are use yelp for every meal and it's absolutely accurate   I don't write reviews because I'm not wired that way    Unfortunately I did not look at the reviews at this restaurant prior to coming here   As I was paying my bill I saw the reviews showed it to the waitress and she said I know our reviews are terrible    This isn't just one review of a disgruntled person you will see how disgusting this place is, as soon as you sit down. The employees have a poor attitude the culture here is terrible. Sammy Hagar must've been drinking way too much of his Cabo Wabo when he put this place in the airport."}
{"text":"They received one star from me because you have to give a rating... zero would have been my choice.  The chicken was way overcooked and the nachos were bland. the cheese wasn't properly melted, the pico de gallo and guacamole had no flavor.  The burnt, boring, and overpriced food was only surpassed by the really bad service.  Our server was friendly enough, and having been in food service in the past, I'm pretty patient; however, she never returned to the table to check on our drinks or ask how the food was because we would have sent the chicken back.  And if any of the other servers are around don't bother asking for their assistance, and  don't even try to get the attention of a bus boy - who may just be cleaning the next table over.  

After waiting a long while for our server to return so that my daughter could get a refill on her soda, she asked another server, who was just standing around chatting up another server.  Her response:  \"Would you like me to get your waitress?\"  Um, no, I'd like anyone to get me refill on a simple little soda...apparently too much to ask.  I know this is an airport restaurant, and Las Vegas of all airports, but c'mon!?  

The bad food and \"you're not my table\" attitude was crazy.  On our return flight via Las Vegas, we bought Sbarro's.   The food was as we expected from Sbarro's, yet still better than Sammy's, for a lot less money, and with friendlier service."}
{"text":"Doesn't matter if you're starving and could eat a horse. Stay starving. This place serves the worst airport food I've ever experienced, and I travel a lot. I ordered the seafood bisque and it was all cheesy seafood broth and tomatoes. I gag thinking about it. My friend ordered the steak melt and it was pitiful. Small portions of meat, stale bread, and it just fell apart. 

The only good thing you can get here is a beer. Can't even say good things about the cocktails- they had absolutely no alcohol in them."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  If you want \"real\" food in terminal C this is where you will find yourself.  Then you might question if fast food wouldn't have been the better option?
I generally skip fast food because of the unhealthy but in this case I am pretty darn sure my Omelette was on par with Popeye's or whomever else was next door.
The flavours were tasty (it's cheese sauce and eggs though-not much to mess up) the coffee was coffee and the service was mostly there.  I mean she wasn't friendly but she didn't glare either.
It's not worth the money but you're in an airport so that's no surprise.

I guess you just have to ask yourself \"Do I have time to kill, do I want to feel like I'm in a restaurant? Do I want to see Sammy Hagar's face over and over again?\" If you answered yes to any of these questions..."}
{"text":"Stopped in Vegas for my connecting flight.  Was hungry and needed something filling.  i didn't want to get fast food, so I decided to give this place a try.  Ordered their chicken sandwich w// fries.  Fries were really good!  They put some cajun like seasoning on it.  Sandwich was okay, just typical grilled chicken, some avocado, and veggies.  Their nachos looked really good.  Saw some man eating it who sat across from me.  Not too bad for airport food though."}
{"text":"The fish n chips is a joke, I can't believe I paid $15 for a staple cafeteria meal with school cafeteria quality."}
{"text":"This place deserves 1 star but I added a second star because I'm in a good mood. 

If you like sad, frustrated, bored servers, shockingly bad food, and unpleasant environment, loud annoying music, this place is for you. 

If that isn't you thing, go literally anywhere else in CLE."}
{"text":"Meh, service is piss poor at best as the Air Port terminal is small, your kinda stuck. I had to bus my own table after sitting at it for 5 minutes as the server just kept walking by us. Not recommended in a tip based profession."}
{"text":"Bland, mealy, starchy food. We had fish tacos and fish and chips. They both tasted the same: obviously frozen stuff in a pre-made batter accompanied by mushy sides. Luke-warm moreover. The tacos were smothered in a undefined sauce that wasn't very good either."}
{"text":"Ok food good service BUT WAY TOO EXPENSIVE even for an airport. All I can say is I hope you won while you were in Vegas before you come here"}
{"text":"Cool little joint in the Las Vegas Airport bearing the Red Rockers name, but the menu needs a reboot. 5 breakfast options and most have eggs (not everyone limes eggs) , but they were cool and gave me sausage instead of the eggs , and then added Michael Anthony's hot sauce into the mix and bingo, a damn fine meal!"}
{"text":"Horrible!!!! So I came here for food because I wanted something different. Different customer service is what we received.  My friend's ice tea was so full of ice that he couldn't even stir the sweetener in without ice coming out of his cup.  I ordered fish and chips and my friend ordered the Sammy Cubano.  In both instances, the waitress asked if we wanted kicked-up fries.  When you look at what kicked-up fries are, they are covered in chili, cilantro, cheese, aioli, and garlic.  It was a dollar extra.  We both said sure.  When the waitress brought our food, my dinner friend's fries only had cilantro and a tiny bit of cheese on them. I was brought fish tacos.  When I brought the fries and completely wrong meal up to the waitress, she said that the kicked-up fries were not the same as the appetizer.  She brought me the correct food and a bowl of chili to make up for the fries.  When I asked to speak to a manager, she said that she would call him but as he is also over another location, it would take him about 10 minutes to get here.  The manager did arrive and admitted that there is a misprint on the menu and apologized for it not being communicated when we ordered.  He made the situation right by only charging us for our drinks. That is the only reason that they are receiving two stars.  I don't recommend coming here.  Stay away!!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason this place even got a star is because my salad was delicious. My friend and I waited here for 10 minutes before we were waited on. I would completely understand is they were really busy but they weren't. Our waitress brought out our silverware for dinner and all we could was laugh because it was PLASTIC. I'm paying $16 for a salad and you give me plastic!? Ha. We did receive our beer and  salads in a timely manner, however they forgot our avocado. Again, not a big deal but it's $16 dollars for a salad you better give me all the toppings. Especially since when another waitress asked us if we needed anything I told her we were missing our ($10) avocado and rolled her eyes and said \"(other waitress' name) they need avocado\". I'm so sorry I ruined your night asking nicely for a little avocado. Other than the poor service the food was really good so if you can get passed that give it a chance!"}
{"text":"Non-typical airport food.  I mean, it tasted pretty good.  The hot sauce was AWESOME.  Over-priced, but that's what airport food is."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and wait staff.  We arrived at the airport in the morning so only breakfast was available. I had the \"Plain Jane classic eggs\" and my wife had the \"Los Cabos smoked bacon and cheese omelet\". My eggs, toast and sausage we're good. The potatoes were a little over cooked and dry. My wife said that her omelette was good. The only reason that I moved their rating to four stars is that the food took a while to come out which could be an issue for people in an airport. Also because my potatoes were overcooked."}
{"text":"Fries cold, service....ok, not great. Prices as high as on the strip, food not near as good. I guess for the airport it's what you get."}
{"text":"So this place just BARELY opened up for business and I thought I would test the waters.  I travel to NV once in a while for business and needed a spot to relax while waiting for my flights.  This is like a typical baja bar/grill.  Complete with surfboards hanging, Sammy Hagar memorabilia, and slide shows of his shows down in Mexico.  It was clean, relaxing and modern (just how I like it).  The bartender was great! He drew me a tall Sam Adams and I ordered some nachos (I'll get to those gems in a minute) I don't recall EVERYTHING that was on tap, but it was typical.  Sam Adams, Stella, etc... 

The Nachos. Oh, the nachos.  I am a fan of the tortilla in any shape or form, and chips are no exception.  Piled high with the typical nacho cheeses, jalepenos, guac, sour cream, etc... But these were no typical nachos...  They had a peculiar flavor to them that I KNEW I had tasted before.  It really was engrossing my mind trying to connect my tastebuds to my memory of that taste.  Then it hit me! Pesto! They had a white, basil pesto drizzled on the nachos and it was amazing! Dare I say, these were the BEST nachos I have ever eaten.  That's a bold statement if you knew how many plates of nachos I have eaten in my life. Very bold.

If you are flying into Vegas for ANY reason... Hit this beauty located near Gate C25.  When you are done, you can stop by the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf and get yourself a small Black Forest.  I promise... your life will be complete."}
{"text":"Airport restaurant to the rescue. I am curious to see if there is a 4-5 star airport restaurant in the US. So, that explains my experience here at Sammy's, just ok. This restaurant is in the C gate area. I believe that is just for Southwest. Seating for those under 21 must be seated in the back, away from the bar or bar top areas. Seating back there is tight and few seating options. We struggled to find a seat to then be able to sit down to a dirty table. The waitress didn't come by for at least 10 minutes but that gave us time to get our order together. I started with Sammy's Mai Tai that was stiff. They must have been distracted when pouring, wow. Just the way I like it. We ordered the beach nachos that came with chicken. It had melted cheese that tasted like cheese-wiz, yes I said it. It had canned green chilies and a few other non noticeable toppings. The chicken was perfectly cooked and had some good flavor. That was the highlight. I dreaded even ordering these as I am sure my stomach will hate me later. I am not dying to return but may accidentally not remembering that we ate here. Ha."}
{"text":"Food: Fish and Chips - $14.99, generous portion and quite tasty. 
Drank: Bloody Mary - $8.79, fantastic. 

I went when the place was only about a quarter full (4:30pm on a Friday), but had fast, friendly service. Not sure where some of these negative reviews are getting their prices from but it's reasonable for an airport - unless they alter the cost of their alcoholic beverages depending on certain times of day. If you can stomach a cheesy, ridiculous slide show of Sammy Hagar on the screens I'd recommend."}
{"text":"The worst place in the airport to have a drink.  Skip it!  Service was horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Damn should have checked yelp before I sat down!  I saw a sign outside claiming to be great.  Landed early from an east coast flight.  It was breakfast time so they only had 5 items available.  The only thing that tickled my fancy was the steak burrito.  Sadly,  I was disappointed.  Sure airport is usually more expensive, $15 for a burrito and side of potatoes.  Most of the people around me didn't look happy either.  Being in the airport,  they can sucker a lot of people.  Asked for salsa for the burrito,  and the response from My sever was there wasn't any but there is hot sauce.  I don't understand that because there is salsa dripping from my burrito.  Steak didn't add any flavor to the meal.  To finish,  server just asked if I'm paying cash or card.  All my life,  I get an itemized bill before paying.  She said I had to give her the signed invoice and it would be followed by the itemized... Seriously... WTF another way to dupe you.  Don't go here.  This place needs to get reorganized to earn anyone's money"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. Not only is the restaurant dirty, the food is gross too. I got the beach salad and the avocado and lettuce in the salad had gone bad. The chicken looked questionable. I ordered a beer that was skunked. All this after a five hour delay."}
{"text":"Cool decor and slide show with excellent pictures of Sammy Hagar.  Unfortunately, this is where it ends.

Ordered the burger melt and a draft.  Beer was fine, burger lacked tremendously.  Biggest shocker was the bill - $10.59 for a draft?  I thought it was an error but it wasn't.

If you don't expect much, then you'll be okay."}
{"text":"Is it my undying love for Sammy? Or perhaps my everlasting addiction to Cabo? I don't know why I continue to eat here so often because this place SUCKS donkey balls! It seems every trip we take (and you know there are tons of them) we end up drinking overpriced Waboritas and eating shitty food at Sammy's Beach Bar and Grill while waiting for our flight. 

We've tried just about everything on the menu and it all is overpriced and disgusting, including the nachos. If you want to kill time in a bar rather than sitting at the gate, go for the chips and salsa and get a margarita with a double shot of tequila, that way it softens the sticker shock when you get the bill."}
{"text":"This review is based on other Airport places to eat.

I'm surprised Sammy would put his name on a restaurant most people just walk by on the way to their gate.  

With that said we had the following:

Chips and salsa with guac & Sammy's big beach burger.

The chips were the out of the bag kind - not so good.  Salsa - no bueno and the guac - well whatever bag it came out of the shelf life on it was probably 50 years.

For the burger - it was actually pretty good.  They only will cook to 'medium done'  but it was tasty seasoned well, wasn't so huge it came apart on the first bit.  I can recommend the burger.

The staff that Saturday evening was pleasant and they have 4 or so micro brews on tap.

Certainly not the worst airport restaurant - no where near the best either."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Even as far as airport food is concerned, this food is of lower quality and higher-prices than other options nearby. Just come to get a drink and don't subject your body to the ongoing torture the food here is going to cause you- no one likes gastrointestinal distress on a plane. 

So disappointed that this place exists, and is packed full of patrons! Perhaps they're like me, unaware of the terribleness that exists on this place. I hope so, at least..."}
{"text":"Lets start off by Day n I didn't even eat here. I walked in the waiter questioned me are you 21 I said yes he kinda paused and the. Told me I could sit anywhere. Strike one. Why would I lie about my age when you're going to id me? 

Ok so I sit I look at the menu decide i want breakfast he comes back I order and he's like breakfast stopped at 10 that's the gust tjinh I told you when you came in. I politely smiled and said ok I thought you said till 12 I kid tuve misheard you sorry. That was strike two and three. 

He must've realized how rude he was being because he gave me a few restaurants that serve breakfast still. So I took his advice and left."}
{"text":"Food is very so so, n service is rather sloppy n slow. Sorry Sammy, but your restaurant needs some serious overhaul. Tables were somewhat dirty as is the floor. Not really worth it."}
{"text":"For airport food, Sammy's is legit. The prices are good (for an airport restaurant), portions are large and the food actually tastes okay.

I got some sort of bacon omelet (the only one on the breakfast menu) and was impressed. My total came out to like $11. Not bad!

Downside: they only had one server working and he was SLAMMED! Poor guy. He did a good job though given that he was the only one waiting tables."}
{"text":"Sammy's Beach Bar is about what you'd expect from an airport restaurant. Prices are ridiculous, service is hurried, and the menu is nothing out of the ordinary.

They've got some hard liquor and Golden Road here though, so it's not so bad."}
{"text":"Bartender 35079 has no customer service skills whatsoever.  Attitude and NO conversation ability. I manage a restaurant and lounge and she seems like a government employee who could care less."}
{"text":"This is a nice and clean place and close to security.  Further down the other places are order out or very small.

We ordered two hamburgers and large Fugi waters and the bill was $40.00!  So be aware!"}
{"text":"This place needs to be blown up and started all over. Wait staff isn't very friendly, the bar tender who is covered in tattoos sucks. It's obvious he doesn't want to be there, and provides the absolute bar minimum of service. 

In ordered the old salad on the menu. The salsa looks a few days old. The guacamole is a weird shade of green - obviously been out in the air too long. I added chicken - it was cold? Fresh off the grill - no way"}
{"text":"Will never come back here. My husband's $11 chili was basically BBQ sauce, beans, and cheese and was \"very average\". I asked for a side of french fries and was charged $7.50 for a small bowl. This place is overpriced and terrible.  They also don't even have chips and salsa. Skip this place and save your money and frustration. Walk down toward C10 and go to La Taquileria instead."}
{"text":"It's not always easy finding descent food that the airport. I've had breakfast here and it was mediocre however yesterday we split the chicken sandwich and it was really good ! The fries with Asiago cheese and Cajun seasoning were perfect for me. Not bad at all. Service was descent no complaints. The decor is a Rock n Roll Beach bar theme in the C gates Terminal 1 ."}
{"text":"Let's be honest most of the airport food is not the best.  It's overpriced, tasteless, commercial food.  Sammy's however sneaked in their and made a difference.  It's owned by legendary rocker Sammy Hagar.  Rock on!!  The breakfast burrito was delish!!  Those potatoes are superb.  Their coffee is Seattle's best.  Always take one to go.  So good.  The server was pleasant.  My table received order very quickly.  I am glad I decided to make this spot my final stop in Vegas before boarding plan to Chicago.  Now I need a nap...."}
{"text":"It's hard to hate an airport establishment like this because it literally is there to provide you with the basics. Food, water, beer. No joke. There's not much else here and this was really the best choice out of all the random bars with random food in the airport so we picked here to wait it out until our flights were boarding.

The waitress was very friendly, and the menu was pretty typical. The portions are ok for the price so no complaints I guess. It is airport food so expect it to be crappier than you want it to be and more expensive than what you are willing to pay and you'll be ok!

The chicken sandwich was passable, the fries were pretty good, and the beers were certainly expensive but cold.

Recommended for time killing."}
{"text":"Seat yourself.

Service - Not the friendliest because they're always in a rush but patient. We had to cancel and re-order some dishes and add some last minute people to our party and our waiter accommodated us.

Time - Food delivered very quickly. 

Country fried potatoes - Warm, comforting, average. 

Sauvignon Blanc - Average tasting. Couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"I sat down before my flight and there were two waitresses and a bartender. One waitress smiled and walked to the bar to have a conversation and laughed with the bartender. The other waitress never looked up from texting on her cellphone by the computer. After sitting and realizing no one was going to greet me I got up and moved to the bar, thinking it would be faster service. I got my food and asked for bbq sauce but they never brought it. I also waited for someone to approach me to ask about my meal so I could ask for napkins and silverware and no one came so I went to the server area and grabbed my own which the girl didn't say anything and just looked at me. The food quality was very poor. I don't expect much for airport food but any fast food burger place would have been better than my sandwich.
The servers might also want to be cautious of the type of conversations they have in front of customers...very inappropriate."}
{"text":"How desperate are you to eat something before boarding your flight?  I think the fast food options like Burger King, Sbarro, and Blue Burrito Grill are better choices in this airport.  This place really stinks. 

The food is terrible (chum).  The service is equally bad.  Ouch."}
{"text":"Try the Los Cabos. Actually one of the most memorable omelettes I've ever tasted. 

Typical airport diner atmosphere but this place exceeded expectations. We've had much worse at other airports."}
{"text":"I give this place a 3 stars based on the service alone. The waiter was very attentive and helpful.

I wasn't too fond of the food. I ended up getting the chicken strips, not bad, but nothing special. It came with a sauce that resembled ranch dressing. It had quite of bit of chicken that was easily split among two people. 

It came with fries which had parmesan cheese on it, but the fries weren't very hot, so the cheese didn't melt. 

This place is pretty busy and I mostly assume because it is the first restaurant before all the others.

Not sure if I would go back again, it was nothing special (food wise). Again, the service was great!"}
{"text":"Not a good restaurant.  I can't complain to bad because it's airport food. This is by far the worst food I have ever tasted.  No need to stop here when at this airport. I think my stomach just let out some gas. I may need to go and get my stomach pumped after this meal. My wife an I are not feeling well at all. Big mistake and I made a lot in my life time. If you cherish your life and don't want to get a colonic after eating then don't go to Sammy`s bar and grill. It will leave you dissatisfied and feeling like you just got stomach raped. You may read this and laughed and think I'm just writing randomly but, I am so serious. I'm currently sitting on my plane and wondering if I should call all my ex girlfriends and apologize because they were better than my short experience here. Signing off. Stay classy"}
{"text":"Utter despair courtesy of \"the red rocker\". Imagine being forced to listen nothing but Sammy Hagar songs, and suffer through easily the worst airport food in the United States.

Sloppy, tasteless food.  A soggy paper towel with salt and red hot sauce would be a better meal."}
{"text":"Wow I'm really surprised at the bad reviews. I would give our experience a 3.5 to 4 stars. The beach salad is seriously one of the best salads I have ever had. I need to find out how they do their chimichurri salad dressing. My husband had a burger and said it was really good. We both agreed that the fries need work. They taste like fries you would buy at a hospital cafeteria. The iced tea was also clearly not fresh brewed. It tasted like it was from concentrate. Speaking of the iced tea, iced tea and soda had refills but is $4. Just get some ice water. Other than that I was really impressed for airport food. Typically the portions are teeny and the quality sucks. This was not the case at Sammy's. I also really like that the profits go to charity. If I have to pay more for airport food it's good to know the proceeds go somewhere worthy."}
{"text":"I paid $14 for a burger with fries that are cold and saggy, there was no flavor in the burger but sweet grilled onions, i had to take my order to go, and none of the servers would help me out cuz they thought no table to no tip am sure, but i ended up tipping the guy who cleaned up the tables i think it was the shift manager too ( weird)  who was the only one who would listen to me and took care of my order!!! Never eating there again. Oh ya am an employee at the airport and i never rated a food place before so thats shows you how bad this place could be."}
{"text":"This rating is for our server Wanda and the food!!!  She did her best to greet her customers, clear the tables, take the order and serve her customer with a smile.  They are definitely understaffed, and I witnessed a manager reprimand another staff member in front of a crowded restaurant full of customers."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced for what they give you! 

This place does not greet customers when you walk in. You seat yourself. I was walking in and the waitress cut me off and didn't even say sorry and didn't even acknowledge that I was there until she realized my daughter was under 21 and made us move seats. 

I ordered the asada tacos. It comes with 2 tacos loaded with lettuce a little less than decent amount of meat, tomatoes, and avocado with fries on the side. It was okay. The meat tasted a little plain but had good texture. The fries were decent as well. 

The service needs a little work. We waited a good ten minutes when we were done eating before the waitress came around again to ask for the check. 

I will not go here again when I come back to the Vegas airport."}
{"text":"2.75 stars.

Go for the drinks.  The food is forgettable.

Soggy fries.  An ok burger.  The best part is the crispy breading on the chicken tenders.

Unfortunately McCarran has a lousy selection of airport eateries."}
{"text":"Not a second time stop the fish and chip was greasy and the fries was cold . Sammy it's time to visit and straightened  this place up the food they are serving is lousy and I wouldn't want my name attached to that . It's not the only place on the strip to go but you better roll up your sleeves up and get some help because they are making you look like a joke !!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give less than one star. We were here on a layover and experienced nothing but irritation from our server, Jeffrey. He not only talked crap about his tables at the server station (1 step from our table) but was also extremely unfriendly and unknowledgeable about the menu. As an airport restaurant I doubt they will look at this, but they certainly should. I hate traveling through Vegas solely because the restaurants are less than mediocre."}
{"text":"Uninspired and uninspiring. Expensive, relatively low quality eats. Beach Burger was bland, effectively flavorless, despite the several default toppings. Anemic chipotle chicken wings were swimming in sauce - perhaps to cover absence of wing meat. Taking the chance of missing out on the signature dish, I opted out of the large bed of \"kicked up\" fries threatened to accompany each dish. Table waiting staff clearly wanted to be somewhere else."}
{"text":"Hey, I liked it. I had the quesadilla and a beer and thought it was great. The service was fast, the food was fresh and hot, and the beer was cold. For airport food, it exceeded my expectations. In an airport that doesn't have many options, this would definitely be my choice."}
{"text":"I just ate here. The food was subpar. I got there about 1130am and wanted breakfast because I hadn't had any. I tried to order breakfast and was told it was over at 10:30am. The waitress said I wouldn't find breakfast anywhere else either. I was really disappointed but decided to stay and eat something else. There were no prices on the drinks. I ordered a Bloody Mary. Typical bar Bloody Mary, nothing special. Ordered one of the few and highly overpriced lunch items. Subpar. Very salty. Basically, I got subpar food and 1 drink at a ridiculous price that I didn't even want. The reason I gave 1 star is because when I left to go to go my gate I passed another eatery not 100 feet down that advertised breakfast served all day. I'm highly disappointed by the waitress lying to me. I will never visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"Greasy soggy egg croissant with heated up frozen potatoes. Gross."}
{"text":"I think some of the negative reviews here are unrealistic...

Let's face it -- if you are eating here you are trapped in Airside C waiting for a flight.  You have no other real choices except fast food.  The place is going to be busy, and the patrons are always in a hurry...  Welcome to an airport restaurant.

And, by the way, the plastic utensils are REQUIRED in an airside for security reasons...

I had lunch and thought the food was good, and the service was attentive.  The prices are hight, but again -- you are IN AN AIRPORT!

I had a better experience than I expected -- so I think 3 stars is appropriate."}
{"text":"Good service.  Asked whether to have the burger or the cubano sandwich and she recommended the Cubano hands down.  She was right.  Very tasty sandwich, fries weren't bad but could have used a little more seasoning. Really not bad for airport fare, but nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"Out of everything! And there was barely any food selection to begin with. I got a quesadilla. Sub par. Sammy Hagar wasn't even there. I doubt he's ever eaten the food there. I mean it's got Sammy Hagar's name on it, I expected better."}
{"text":"Remembered Sammy's when it was located at Harrah's St Louis. This place was just a little better than average for being in an Airport."}
{"text":"This place at the airport is horrible.  I paid $12.00 for a cabo wabo margarita that was plain.  The food is horrible, the service is horrible. Stay away = $53.00 for a lunch and wendys would have been better.  Also there is a bar waiter that talks constantly.  This was not a good experience, I dread seeing it on my VISA in a month!  
Save your money !!"}
{"text":"Food was barely edible and drinks were weak. I could forgive all that if it wasn't $70 for an appetizer and two drinks. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"As others had mentioned, it was just ok. Needed some food during a long layover, so it did the job. Nothing spectacular. Nice slide show of Sammy though, and nice memorabilia."}
{"text":"Breakfast has very limited choices. I had the Los Cabos Omlet. It was terrible for the price. The eggs were watery, way too much cheese, and the avocado was cooked inside making it lose it's flavor and just look like a green mess. The hash browns were cold when my meal came out, and they gave me a hard clump of butter to butter my own toast with. Not a good choice."}
{"text":"Only place to grab a quick meal and a glass of wine before we flew back to LA. It was meh...Will I go back? Possibly for another glass of wine. Wings were meh..."}
{"text":"Meh.....it was ok. Chicken fingers came our warm, def not hot hot. Sauces were ok but not great. Salad was ok--guac was boring on it and corn mixture seemed like it was from a can. Prob should have gone to Wendy's. oh well!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for portions . Nachos were horribly salty. For $17 you think they could use real cheese instead of the cheese sauce you get at bowling alleys"}
{"text":"Don't expect any service.  Very rude.  Refused service.  We were stuck at airport because flight was delayed.   Fat slob of a waiter told us to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Its airport food. With flavor though! Service is scattered and servers can be a little frazzled if it is busy, but I was taken care of. Food is fairly quick if you have some time to kill in gate C. 
Fish tacos are basically the same as fish and chips, but the mahi was good, juicy, and the chipotle crema on top was solid. 
It is open seating, and you will find other peoples food in front of you and may wait to have the table wiped down before you sit, but it is an AIRPORT, PEOPLE. Manage your expectations with ambiance and seating, but the food is tasty."}
{"text":"Mushroom quesadilla was quite good as far as airport food goes. Limited beer selection and it closes before 7:30! OK experience but I'm tempted try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Decent food in a very busy airport. Would recommend the house burger. Simple, quick and filling. Yes, there is an airport premium on the food prices, but it's fairly low, especially compared to the price of comparable food on the Strip. Would consider coming back if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"Had the Ahi fish tacos; wasabi sauce and cabbage was good, fish was grilled medium rare, first 2 tacos were good, 3rd was fishy."}
{"text":"Seriously sucks. Service was TERRIBLE. Why any self respecting person would franchise his name (brand) and not check on it is beyond me. How many thousands go to this place and would then never go to one of his real spots or buy anything else with his name associated with it?

Avoid unless you are stuck and on a company expense plan.

Realize, you pay for the seat not the food. It was incredibly poor quality frozen food barely warmed. For breakfast, go to a nearby fast-food for better quality."}
{"text":"Egg (if it really was) didn't taste like egg, Luke warm, and rubber hash browns..... Next time I just eat at Starbucks!"}
{"text":"One star for service and fries, could've had the same burger at a fast food restaurant, did not expect to be so dirty, I know it's an airport restaurant, but you could do a lot better job, lamp over our heads was covered with thick dust, sat at window seat, counter even dirty. Disappointed !"}
{"text":"I stopped in here on my way to Cali hoping for something gluten free before my flight. It was pretty busy and only a couple overly stressed servers. It has a long bar, naturally as its Vegas, and then lots of little crammed in tables in booths with barely any room. 

My server was nice enough to point out a few things she thought I could have. There wasn't a lot of confidence as to what was and wasn't gluten free. She asked the kitchen if I could have the nachos. They said yes but in retrospect I probably should have been more careful cause I could hear there was a pretty significant language barrier. 

So I did go with the nachos which were pretty good. Chicken and a cilantro sauce along with the nacho cheese and jalapeños. There was a pretty good sized portion and I took some in a box with me for later. I never did end up feeling sick so I think the nachos are a safe bet here.

Other notes, I did hear another customer complain of dirty silverware, mine was ok. Food came out in good time but not a lot of server attention in regards to filling water glasses or getting you anything else you might need. Price was pretty average for airport food. 

Overall, it's ok. I may try something different next time I'm in the airport."}
{"text":"For air port food it was not bad. House super spicy Bloody Mary $9 Cuban sandwich was on the small side for $13. Fast service."}
{"text":"Pretty terrible experience. Omelets on the menu were limited so I asked for onion, jalepenos and a little cheese. The waitress said we don't really change our I Omelets. Eggs and cheese it is. I got a tiny bowl of rotten fruit, had to be canned pineapple and a pretty disgusting runny fake cheese drenched egg substitute egg thing. Waitress watched me and did nothing. Coffee is pretty lame as well."}
{"text":"My reviews are normally positive but I just can't help not passing along my negative opinions here to save others from wasting their money. This is the worst place I have ever patronized in an airport. Both the service and the food was absolutely terrible and over priced. I will NEVER eat here again. I even told the server that we were in a hurry just like 90% of the people in there. It didn't matter the food came out 30 minutes later no exaggeration. Chicken sandwich ordered was a dried up mess and way too small for the bun. Tacos were also the worst I have ever tasted. Good luck Sammy, stick to making music!"}
{"text":"With a hour delay, we ventured from Gate B to Gate C, the Southwest mecca and were drawn to the outside of Sammy's which caught our eye.   Things quickly went downhill after.

Service was slow but hopefully the food would make up for it.  We got a bacon cheese burger which was 13.50 but worse than a 2 dollar burger at your nearby fast food joint.  It was worse than your elementary school burger with the exception that it was topped with lettuce, tomato, and bacon. 

The so called breakfast wrap for 9.99 was filled simiply with egg.  Overall i felt robbed - in fact i think i would have felt better if someone held me up for 25 dollars then i could eat my miseries away after with enjoyable food.

Do yourself a favor and dont come here EVER.  Wendy's, Poepyes, and Villa Pizza is a few steps down and you'll pay 30-40% less and get better food."}
{"text":"Sammy's Beach Bar and Grille is unfortunately pretty typical of airport fare; overpriced previously frozen food and less than stellar service. With all of that being said my wife and I hit this place with a high level of frequency when flying out of McCarran. Why you ask? The Waborita! As pedestrian as the nachos and chili-cheese fries may be, the over-priced Waborita is pretty darn good. You may want to sit at the bar though, as service is brutally slow at this location.

  Sammy's does do a lot of charity work in the community which makes a stop here slightly more palatable. So if you're a little early for your flight suck it up and have a Waborita. As expensive as it may be, it's a pretty good drink."}
{"text":"It's airport food, either owned by or using a famous person's name -- you are going to overpay - just deal with it! If the high prices at the airport bother you... eat BEFORE your come to the airport!

Bar service was friendly, and the food was ok. Don't expect the high end experience - but definitely better than most airport joints."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. My food was completely wrong and had to wait another 20 min for it to come back out when I already waited like 30. Every beer that my boyfriend ordered was wrong and instead of telling us a keg had kicked they just brought another beer but was going to charge for the beer we asked for. I'll never eat there again. $70 wasted. All we got was a \"oh my bad\"."}
{"text":"No hostess at this place so if you dont see any seats when you walk in you have to just settle for something else because you will stand up there indefinitely waiting for someone. 

The food here was just ok.  Truly nothing special and for the prices I would say you could find a better deal somewhere else.  I liked the appetizer of the spiced chilli fries and that was about all I enjoyed overall.  The chicken fingers... well lets just say I have had frozen ones that tasted better."}
{"text":"Sammy needs to return to this location. Sad, very sad. I've been making this my go to location over the last several years. Best shrimp cocktail. Tasty drinks. Great frys & nachos. NOT ANY MORE. They changed the main chief according to my server. NO shrimp cocktail. In fact, they only have BAY SHRIMP. Bad. Then there's the fish & chips. Easily the worst I ever had. Seriously ! (Same over beaded fish in their tacos). When I meet people and they say I don't like fish tacos, I know now why. \"They had these\". The Nachos look impressive but canned/fake cheese sauce & canned/pickled jalapeno's. If you go here expect very high prices for marginal drinks & stay away from the food if your smart. Sammy, this place has become a \"black eye\" in your history of successes. They must have lost the lease on this place & making the most $$$ they can till it closes. Seriously. Only explanation I can think of."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews for Sammy's, I was not expecting much to be honest with you.. However, I was pretty pleasantly surprised with this little chill spot.

The airport was packed so I definitely wanted to find somewhere I could kind of relax in peace. I started with the seafood bisque which came out pretty quick and was really good! It had grilled shrimp in it as well as either lobster or crab meat. I also ordered the Cuban sandwich per the recommendation of the waitress. It was better than your average Cuban sandwich for sure. It had all of your Cubano essentials.. Pulled pork, ham, pickles, spicy mustard. It was cooked really well though and the flavors were great. The fries were pretty average.. Nothing to write home about, but they did have some sort of crumbly white cheese on them which was interesting. Don't think I saw that in the description. 

The service was great also. Everything came out quick and the waitress probably refilled my water like 4 times (so necessary in Vegas..)."}
{"text":"We had fast and friendly service here. The food was very good and we enjoyed our experience. I'm not sure why this restaurant in terminal 1 has such a low star rating, but considering the other options here, especially for breakfast, I give this restaurant a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Beach nachos are amazing. Burger that I had wasn't to bad. And the carne asada melt the wife had was great. Service is fast ppl are friendly"}
{"text":"I just paid $29 plus tip for one of the worst burgers I've ever had.  (Cost includes a cocktail) The burger  meat was dry and tasteless, the seasoned fries were not seasoned and they were cold.  The service was awful too.  I would have babe better off at Burger King!  Don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty crappy.  Food tastes like it came from 7-11.   Avoid the chips and guacamole.   The $16 Bloody Mary was decent and the workers friendly.   Save your money"}
{"text":"Sammy Hagar's place is supposed to put your mind in the land of sunshine and surfboards on a cold Cleveland day.  The decor is kitschy and catchy. They were out of hamburgers, probably a good thing.  I ordered a mixed drink an the seafood bisque.  The drink took over 15 minutes to arrive and arrived after the bisque.  The bisque was lukewarm but actually pretty good.  The staff looked unhappy and the place was packed but it was very quiet so you couldn't feel any \"vibe.\"  Below my expectations of a fun and relaxing place, but the bisque actually hit the spot."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!! LISA rocks!!!! The bartender is rad, friendly and makes you feel at home. I had a long layover from San Diego and she made it a blast!!!! Thank you for the amazing time!!! Can't wait to hang again!!! And MAGGIE she's rocks too!! Love the staff !!!! 

These people are the best place to visit in Ohio !!!!"}
{"text":"Bad, bad. Food was gross and the house margarita is awful. Staff was very nice, but the poor guy was overwhelmed and we had to wait a while for food. Finally had to say something so we didn't miss our flight."}
{"text":"I give it two stars because they had a good drink (Sammy's Mai Tai) but the portions are extremely small and the drinks are very expensive! I know it's the airport but sheesh. 

I ordered the nachos and 25 years (lol-mins) later we received the nachos and it was so small! Needless to say I was not happy. I asked them for fries instead and they gave them to us (no charge) which was nice. 

However I don't think I'll be going here again."}
{"text":"Dave is THE best bartender at an airport bar I have ever encountered. And we travel a lot. Good recommendations for food and s good Bloody Mary!"}
{"text":"I would round up to 2.5, but \"A-OK\" is a bit too strong.

Here's the deal: it's a place to grab food and/or drinks while waiting for your flight.  There's no way the food is going to be great, the ambience will be amazing, or the service to be stellar.  I'd be a bit happier if the tables were slightly more clean, but hey, maybe I'm asking for too much.  

What I did appreciate is that there actually was some flavor in the food.  Jim G. and I shared the Eggs with Queso Fresco and, while the amount of said queso left me wondering why it was part of the name of the dish, the flavor of the jalapenos and the spicy tomato salsa on top surprised me.  There was plenty of food there, as they give you a ton of these lukewarm potatoes and a tortilla.  

Our server was nice, but too busy and therefore not all that attentive.  Food took a bit longer than I'd like (especially at an airport) and it took a bit too long to get our check.  

It's in the airport; I don't expect a ton. You shouldn't either."}
{"text":"Skip it!
Walk down the terminal a bit further for any other option.
The food is beyond bad (I got fish & chips and wouldn't finish because they are cold, ultra greasy, and tasteless)
Service is ok but slow."}
{"text":"I have THOROUGHLY enjoyed Kim as my bartender! 
She smiles, she encourages conversation which makes it just a great happy experience!! I hanks Kim!!
You made a VERY SAD day just a bit better!! Take care and enjoy your views!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is AWFUL. Poor service, slow cooks, nasty food. On a plus note, they are consistent. You wont ever have to worry about having a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Best Bloody Mary I've ever had, until I saw the price, 14.00?  Wow.  

Dropped in for breakfast but ended up just getting a drink because of the lack of options (4) on the menu.  

Service was quite wonderful, I found staff to be quick and polite.  Drinks and check came fast."}
{"text":"We tried the fish and chips and the island burger. Both were good, not spectacular, but good. The stand out was the vinegar aioli. Loved that! Wait staff were distracted by some tragedy.  Heard bits and pieces of it..."}
{"text":"I know it's the only place to eat in the A concourse, but I'd reccommend against it. The beer was fine, server was passably friendly, but the food leaves a lot to be desired.  Ordered the 1/3 pound \"old fashioned\" burger with fries, medium. Got a well-done and dried out burger, obviously pre-formed and frozen. It was accompanied by a very sparse serving of fries which weren't too bad, but were dwarfed by the huge platter they came on. 

I ate a third of the burger and then waited to see what would happen while drinking my beer. The server walked by at least a dozen times in 30 minutes with most of the burger sitting on my plate. She never asked how it was or if something was wrong with it. She ended up asking if I wad done and when I replied yes, she took my plate and dumped the 2/3s of the burger left in the can. 

I realize I could have said something, but I figured I would see what would happen without any prompting.  I found out... nothing."}
{"text":"This place has decent music an ambiance when you need to relax while you're waiting for your flight.  The servers sure as nice, but it gets cramped quick when you're trying to find a place to sit and eat with everyone's luggage hanging around.

Anything that comes out of their kitchen that has their unique sauces is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Every time I go through Cleveland airport, this place gets more pitiful.    They ignore patrons, are out of food items and have a million excuses why they were lax.  Sammy needs to know his money was poorly spent.  Bartender is nice and attentive.   Other than that, they need to fire the waitress staff and redo their business  plan."}
{"text":"If you're looking for horrible overpriced airport food this is your spot. The drinks were good but the food was subpar.. $15 for a steak sandwich that was small, and the cheese was canned nacho cheese . Gross. I got the seafood bisque and it was good but still very overpriced for the product . Def not worth the money"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here a couple of days ago.  Sat at the counter, and endured a very weak meal of sausage and eggs, served by the most inattentive and stuck-up barkeeper ever.  Bad food, beyond-horrible service, served with a bit of attitude...all while watching an endless loop of images of an overweight Sammy Hagar.  That's an hour (and 30 bucks) I'll never get back..."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious options but awesome service. Very attentive and welcoming. I did t realize it was a restraint in the airport!"}
{"text":"If there was zero stars I'd give zero stars!
Happened to be next to our gate and got one of the most rudest expressions from our waitress I'd ever experienced in food service. No greeting, no smile no water service. Determined that her horrible attitude was due to her football team losing. But as soon as you asked for the check, suddenly the shift to the most inauthentic \"I'll try to be nice for a tip\" attitude: crappiest service ever!"}
{"text":"OMG Sammy's Big Beach Burger was insane! Perfectly well done, bacon, guac, 2 kinds of cheese, etc.. I needed a fork - yummy! 
I needed something more healthy and fresh than Wendy's or BK... I hit the spot.
Wide choice of seat styles, wonderfully friendly staff.
High airport prices."}
{"text":"Came during breakfast time and didn't want breakfast but they still found me something! And found a place to charge my dead computer. My bartender Jennifer was fantastic. Helpful and friendly, I'd go back! Yeah for Vegas hospitality"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm a big fan of Sammy Hagar. But just like Jimmy Buffet, he needs to leave the restaurant business up to the food experts. The burger sounded good: bacon , guacamole, cheese, fried onions. But it literally had no taste. And the fries were probably the worst I've ever had. They were very hard and crunchy with no taste. To top it off, it cost $14. 
Do yourself a favor: go there for drinks but don't waste your money, time, or calories on the food. Come on Red Rocker, you should have better standards. I had High Hopes but was let down."}
{"text":"I never expect much from airport food, but come on, at least try!!!  $40 for 2 pre-made overcooked burgers and 1 beer.  They were out of steak and chicken which left the worse than McDonalds burger the only option.  Server was friendly enough but doesn't make up for the food."}
{"text":"5 stars because Irma took great care of us! Quick service and attentive! Food compares to a Chilis type restaurant. Thanks Irma!"}
{"text":"2 hour layover, decided restaurant instead of a bar.. BIG MISTAKE!  Just wanted something simple, ordered chili cheese fries and a beer.  Fries were cold, and flavor was not that of chili. After sitting here for an hour, our waitress Lisa  finally decided to see how we were doing..  did I forget to mention she sure waited hand and foot on the table behind and in front of us.  Poor service, horrible food!  Go elsewhere while at Vegas airport."}
{"text":"This was pretty good for airport food. 
I had a chicken sandwich. good atmosphere I really like the pictures of Sammy and friends on the walls and on the TV's which is cool cause I'm a big fan. 

I'd like to try another location that's not an airport see if its even better food."}
{"text":"I'm rarely pleasantly surprised by airport restaurants. This was no exception. 

The seafood bisque was small and had more chives and salt than seafood. The burger patty was ok but the toppings and bun were lacking in freshness. The service was also as others have mentioned. 

As a classic rock fan though, I enjoyed the music and had time to kill so it served the purpose and was, as I said, about what I'd expected."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a quickish meal before my flight and almost left several times. The chalkboard said to seat yourself so I sat down by myself at a table in the middle of the restaurant. 5 minutes passed and I hadn't been greeted. I saw the waitstaff seemed to be busy and waited longer until the couple sitting at the table next to me chimed up a conversation and commended on my still not being served. About 10 minutes had passed and I watched tables around me be cleared and other people sat in them. The couple next to me flagged down a waitress and told her I hadn't been served yet and she said she's get there. 5 minutes later, still no service, no water, not even a hello or letting me know they'd be there in a minute. The couple beside me the caught the attention of another waitress and told her I still had not been waited on at all. She replied \"okay, nobody is helping me\". She was obvious under a lot of stress. About 35 minutes after I arrived a waitress came over, greeted me and asked for my order. She was polite but unapologetic. I ordered a salad and a water. Someone else delivered by food in a relatively short amount of time and the salad was pretty good; simple but good. I ate in about 15 minutes and when my waitress came back to check on me after about 20 I asked for my check, paid, and left.
I wouldn't recommend going here if you need a meal in any reasonable amount of time and for the price you could probably find something better somewhere else in the airport."}
{"text":"They got 1star because it wouldn't allow me to rate it a zero. There was a crushed ant in my napkin, hair in my sons fries, the portions were ridiculously small and the food was cold. Horrible!!"}
{"text":"The server was the only bright spot at Sammy's.  The fish and chips was not fresh, reheated from some time ago I'm guessing."}
{"text":"Nicole is the worst server! She was condescending, rude, slow, unhelpful, I could go on and on. The food was very greasy. I ordered a cheeseburger that showed up with no cheese. My boss had a beer and the orange that came with it was old and slimy. Bottom line low quality food, terrible service. NEVER GO HERE"}
{"text":"Good food at the airport. The place was busy and my food came fast, hot, correct order and good tasting. Not much more you could ask for while waiting for a flight at the airport. I would definitely come back here again when I return to this terminal. 4 stars only because I would rather have a bigger selection on items. Only chocolate cake for dessert option. Surely they could have two items instead of only chocolate cake."}
{"text":"Horrible service, pretty sure we got over charged as well. Decided to come here again after having terrible service a few months ago. Dirty, slow service and not worth your time or money!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was pretty good for being a restaurant inside an airport. we were happy to find a decent sit down establishment while we waited for our flight. I Had the chicken cobo basically chicken tenders with fries and it was pretty good. I didn't care for the coffee it tasted weired. My wife had the burger which she thought was good."}
{"text":"Apparently Sammy's has the only decent wings in the Vegas airport.  They offer great hot sauce and an interesting tequila lime ...reminds one of jamaican jerk sauce.  Good service though the tattoo'd rock star bartender keeps calling me 'bro' ..which irks me to no end coming from anyone...so fake, but hey, that's Vegas for ya."}
{"text":"Usually good and friendly service, expensive (airport priced) beer and drinks (not the servers fault!).  Better than sitting at the gate.  Will visit again, I'm sure.

Have not eaten here."}
{"text":"Four star for a decent breakfast wrap and very quick service! My husband & I decided to stop by there while waiting for our flight, there were fast food around but he never likes to sit down and eat fast food so he dragged me to this place and we shared a wrap with potato side. I was impressed on how quick it was served!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast while waiting for my flight.  They said at the door if you have time to spare to come on in because the meal would take at least a half hour.  I'm glad they gave the warning, because if I had been in a hurry I would've been in trouble!

Our table ordered the breakfast burrito, the croissant French toast, and plain Jane (or whatever the straight up breakfast is called).  The French toast wasn't warm, but the rest was absolutely delicious.  A surprising - and very filling - meal before getting on to the plane.  The service was as attentive as possible given the crowd, but they do have little \"Kall Buttons\" that help signal for service or a bill if you're not be attended to in a way you need.

For a little airport place, it was pretty legit."}
{"text":"Sammy would be ashamed. Big music fan. Restaurants are not his forte if this is what he thinks is acceptable. \"Out of all grilled chicken items and only 2 draft beers on tap that are working\". A good thing that the staff was very friendly. My order was messed up but I decided to just take it the way it was. It was a tasty burger. Nothing fancy. Weirdest part..zero music playing."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar as I needed to grab some food before my flight. I regret not going to the food court next door. The bartender, Dean, was just completely inept and unable to do anything correctly. A diner next to me had to ask for his beer three times before receiving it. I ordered a simple burger from their menu, but received something completely different. 
I'm not sure if he was just having an off day, but I should not receive someone else's order and my own incorrect order. 
Not to mention the huge wait for food. 

The food itself is nothing special. I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"\"..you are never as tall as when you kneel to help a child. Sammy has dedicated his profits from this restaurant to local community children's charities\" 

http://www.sammysbeachbarandgrill.com/locations/las-vegas/

So, because Sammy Hagar donates his profits to charity (what an awesome gesture), I will gladly give his expensive airport restaurant a five star review. 

Yes, it's overpriced, even by airport standards. My \"Sammy's Breakfast Burrito\" (Flour tortilla, scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, guacamole, pico de gallo, queso fresco, with bacon or sausage) ran 14 and a half buckaroos and a coffee (Seattle's Best and EXCELLENT) ran $3.50. So after tax, that's like $20 which was definitely too much for what I got.

But let me say this, my breakfast plate was pretty darned good. Lots of scrambled eggs, lots of sausage, great tasting guacamole and pico, and a generous scoop of home fries. 

But that pricing! You can get a hotel style buffet for that money, but hey -I wasn't at a Marriott or a Sheraton brunch, I was at the Las Vegas Airport.

Service was fine, with multiple check backs and coffee refills.

I liked the music in the restaurant a lot. Between Sammy Hagar commentaries, I heard the Stones, the Who, AC/DC, Talking Heads and a great old song-Spirit in the Sky by Norman Greenbaum. 

I wonder if I can write off my breakfast as a tax deduction?"}
{"text":"When it comes to airport dining, often the choices are slim-pickin's.  

That said, hubby and I were pleasantly surprised by our eats at Sammy Hagar's \"beach\" diner.  It was a bit pricey, but that's to be expected in an airport.  Our server was also very sweet!  Between the two of us, we ordered the nachos and seafood bisque.  To add meat to my nachos would have been an extra $4 (!!) so I opted for the meatless version, which wasn't bad.  It was topped with jalapeños, cheese, olives, pico, guacamole, sour cream and a tasty chorizo dressing.  I ate the whole thing in record time!  My man seemed to like his bowl of bisque (both were served with tortilla chips).  I like that our food was presented on black guitar pick-shaped plates, even if the restaurant soundtrack was devoid of Van Halen (?!).

This is no Wolfgang Puck's, but it feeds well in a pinch."}
{"text":"This place is just worthless. We ordered a Stella beer and were charged for a Sam Adams. We also received the wrong beer. Kelsie , the waitress was not friendly at all and took fifteen minutes to retrieve a Bud Light which was okay at best. I could have got past these mistakes if the price wasn't so high but nope. 43$ for greasy small portions and a bad time."}
{"text":"Skip and keep moving. $15 for a rum and coke that tasted like water! I have been all over Las Vegas and never spent that much for a rum and coke... Food was very ok. And service was just ok. I would never go back nor tell anyone to even get a glass of water here."}
{"text":"Excellent option for the airport. Food, beer, and service were all good. Cubano sandwich is a great choice and a bargain at $13."}
{"text":"Never again!!!  This place is aweful.  Sammy Hagar should be embarrassed to call this place his.  The failed to tell us they were out of several condiments. So the burger I ordered was missing cheese, guacamole and pickles. My wife's chicken sandwich was missing avocado, and flavor.  The server and bartender and got in a argument in front of us.  It was horrible experience and way more expensive than any other place in the airport.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Stopped by Sammy's here at the airport today with my friends.  It was surprisingly not bad like some of the other eateries at McCarran. This is in the C side of terminal 1.

The restaurant's dining area isn't that big so it's tough to navigate through with your luggage.  You seat yourself and then the lovely wait staff will come to help take care of you.  We were lucky enough to have Ruthlee help us out today.  They also have the cool buttons at the table where you can ring for service or pay your bill.  Granted the place is small enough where it might not be necessary but it is helpful to have just in case.

I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and it was pleasantly good.  It comes with grilled chicken, guacamole, spread, tomato, lettuce, chipotle crema, queso fresco, and crispy onion.   It came with a seasoned side of fries.  There's also cholula at the tables along with ketchup so it added an extra kick to the fries.
Food came out decently quick since they probably expect people have plane rides to catch.  I will definitely have to come back the next time I have to reluctantly eat at the airport."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here because it was close to our gate and looked decent. We went with their top picks - the seafood bisque and the carnitas - and it came out far from decent. The presentation was terrible, fries were terrible, and the food was just alright. Definitely not a healthy pick either. 

Don't be deterred by the amount of people you see - I would NOT recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. The server was incredibly rude and the food was over cooked and cold when it came out of the kitchen. I'd recommend getting anything else to eat while at McCarran airport."}
{"text":"I don't even know how to start this review. On the way home, we stopped at this place to grab a bite. I waited about 15 mins before a server came to greet us. Once she arrived, she apologized for the wait, it was fine, we were not annoyed by it at all. I ordered a chicken sandwich and my fiance ordered a salad. Her salad made it to the table in about 5 mins. She took a bite and she realized the guacamole (advertised as avocado only) tasted odd, \"like the fridge\". It was an odd salad, HUGE, just some greens, jicama and an ice cream scoop shaped glop of \"avocado\" and some dressing. We planned to send it back but we didn't see our server again. After about 30 mins and hearing nothing and not seeing our server, I was ready to go. Our flight was leaving in 45mins. I had to walk up to the bar and ask our server to come see us. She got to our table and I stated that I hadn't received my sandwich and explained the issue with the salad. Her first response was \"well I put the sandwich in\". My response was \"That's not the point, I don't have it\". Her response \"it's not my fault\" I was annoyed already by the fact that a. I didn't have my food b. she never came to our table again, and now our server is saying it's not her fault. The salad. We let her know the salad wasn't good. Her response \"Looks fine to me\". I said. We want to talk to a manager. Her response \"Why? that salad is fine, she can't help you\". Her next sentence was \"If you want that free I have to get a manager because I can't take things off the check\". I said, \"I don't want to pay for this and I'm not paying for the sandwich I didn't receive either, get me a manager please\". She stormed away. After about 5 mins she comes back and lays a check on out table. I assumed that it was a 0 check and she chose not to have a manager come to see us. I was fine with that. I was in a hurry and I wasn't ready to fight with anyone honestly. I looked at the check and was shocked to see the salad. I looked at her and said, \"I'm not paying for that salad, it was inedible\". She looked right at me, grabbed the check, and wadded it up and threw it at us. She said, \"well, sorry, don't pay then\". At that point, I decided to pay. I didn't want to be accused of stealing in an airport trying to get home. My fiance put $7 on the table. She grabbed the money and chased us out the door literally grabbing my fiance trying to shove the money back into her hand yelling \"take it, take it. I don't' want your money\". There are so many things wrong with this story. Was I clearly annoyed? yes. Should we have been treated that way when we complained about bad service and bad food? NO. You make your own judgment but we will not be back."}
{"text":"Don't bother. Find another place at the airport. It's not a long walk to any of the other terminals. NONE of the four meals we can refresh came as described in the menu.  I guess quite fittingly it reflects the namesake of the bar."}
{"text":"The service was ABSOLUTELY, HANDS DOWN, THE WORST I have ever experienced! The menu had about five things on it. Not good for breakfast. The food  items that we ordered was the fruit and yogurt, eggs and hash browns. They were both revolting! My wife spat the food back onto the plate. The neighboring table next to us agreed with the problem with the lack of good food let alone food. They had no bagels or toast because of no toaster. They had eggs and hash browns and the yogurt with the fruit I mentioned before. Although it is Sammy's restaurant, he should NOT be playing his loud, overbearing music especially in the mornings. Do not eat here. Anywhere else in the airport is better than this."}
{"text":"I have been waiting over 20 minutes for fries and steak tacos. This place is slow. Luckily I am not in a rush. The steak tacos were cold when I got them and only one strip of meat for each soft taco. There was some kind of dried bean purée on top that tasted better than it looked. The fries were also cold and the cheese they had on top was not melted and fell to the bottom of the container.  The best part of this place is the beer is cold and they serve Wabo Cabo tequila. Certainly not worth the $30.40 before tip. I would recommend going to one of the other bars in the airport."}
{"text":"It's an airport so you expect a few bucks more but 14 bucks for some romaine lettuce with croutons is a bit ridiculous.    Tasted fine.   I love Sammy Hagar but definitely didn't feel like I was hanging with hlm in Cabo!"}
{"text":"0 star
I was just there around 8:00 am Las Vegas McCarran Airport Memorial Day. 
WE WERE DENIED SERVICE. They seated us but the waitress never came to our table. We waited for about 10 min. she took care of the couple next to us but never acknowledged we were even there. I am a registered nurse and my husband is an army veteran. We have both served people no matter the race. Disappointing....Memorial Day"}
{"text":"Nasty! Nasty! Nasty! Do NOT eat here! Dirty! Dirty! Dirty! How can nachos be nasty??? Nasty! Ordered a Bloody Mary...how hard is that?!?! Celery two weeks old! Did I say dirty? Nasty?"}
{"text":"I'm glad I didn't check Yelp for once because I had a much better experience than most seem to have had at Sammy's.  My 9 AM flight was delayed so I stopped here to eat a little breakfast.  Everyone was very nice and service itself was quick.  The food took a little long to come out, but my waitress knew I wasn't in a hurry so she may have pushed a few rush orders up.  I was able to sit at table, get some work done, and eat a normal meal instead of fast food.  My hot tea was replenished twice with not just hot water, but additional tea bags and lemons, which is more rare than you'd think.

The breakfast menu is limited to 5 dishes, but they cover your standard morning fare- eggs, French toast, yogurt, etc.  I ordered the Plain Jane Classic Eggs $10.49 (choice of eggs, meat, & toast with breakfast potatoes.)  Nothing special, but nothing wrong with any items either.  I would definitely stop here again if I was waiting for a flight in the C terminal."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast. It's typical of all airport food, its either frozen or otherwise all pre made food, and it costs way too much! 

I had the fruit and yogurt plate. Most of fruit was ripe, usually not the case in situations like this. Also, the bowl of yogurt was large, there was no way I could finish. 

My husband got the breakfast burrito. Which as shown on the menu is just tortilla, eggs, sour cream, salsa, and potatoes on the side. It costs extra for cheese and meat to be added to your plain burrito. The whole this was much better than I expected, the flavor was quite good for airport dinning! 

I was a little sad at the lack of decaf beverage options. I wanted something warm and decaf, like tea or hot chocolate or even a decaf coffee, and the waitress insisted that they had nothing."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the nachos & carne asida tacos. Nice flavors of chicken & pork respectfully.  Good & cheesie.  Nice creama & avocado topping. Fresh veggies. Fast service large portions. Enough to pack on plane."}
{"text":"Awful! Awful! Awful! My husband's overpriced ($10.50) I PA was weak and tasted like the tap lines had never been cleaned.   My \"Golden Tiki\" was DISGUSTING!  The absolute worst drink I have ever had in my life!!!  Thankfully, after I told the waitress this she got it taken off the bill.  The food was greasy and the environment was even greasier.   I would highly recommend NOT going here, ever!"}
{"text":"Ordered nachos and a drink. Nachos were ok. Could not go wrong with that. Typical airport cafe. Service was surprisingly better than expected . 
This is nothing you would expect from The Red Rocker. A franchise capitalizing on his name."}
{"text":"The Pollo Bocadillo chix sandwich was surprisingly decent.  Chix tenders had too much batter and too salty.  Service is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We were here at the airport before leaving for an early flight. It was located next to Starbucks and the line was a million miles long so we chose to try here instead. Especially since Sammy Hagar does make one of my favorite tequilas so I figured the food would be just as good... Wrong. 

Never again. Sign said to have a seat and we'd be waited on. Yep, zero clean tables. Waitress ignored us for about a half hour until she finally came to take our drink order. Another half hour later she realizes she forgot our drinks. She brings my fiancé a coffee in a used cup with an obvious recent lipstick stain and my water had the straw already in it with bite marks on the top of the straw, maybe one or 2 sips out of it. Still. Disgusting. Let me catch some strangers possible contagious diseases. 

Then we order our food- surprise! they are out of half of the 6 items on their breakfast menu due to \"moldy bread.\" Yet when our orders arrived they had some stale ass rock hard bread as a side. Go figure. 

I ordered a steak and egg meal. I think it was about $16+? About the only part of the meal I could tolerate was the eggs even though they were much more raw than I asked for. If you ever saw old over thawed frozen meat sitting in the fridge turn gray, this would be the taste description id leave for my steak. Id swear I was eating liver if it looked any different, although I think liver tastes better than that. Glad I never got food poisoning (although I did at the end of my trip so it could've been an extended onset lol). And then the home fries, so very dry and yet rubbery at the same time, no texture or flavor or anything. Ketchup couldn't even save them. Save yourself the overly priced \"food\" they serve here and bring a pad of paper to chew on."}
{"text":"This bar is reminiscent of a bar you would try to sneak into when you were 14. Never was anyone in here ID for an ID they all seemed plenty able to verify their food orders 25 minutes after sitting down. By the time I sat down and ordered, I had minimal time before my seating.

My chicken sandwich was reheated, pre frozen chicken with wheat bread on top. Shockingly low quality. Service quality I would write a one out of five, food quality I would rate of 1/5, audience quality one out five, overall quality one out of five. 

it reeks like secondhand smoke, do you service quality is subpar, and the food quality is something out of a fast food sitdown restaurant from the Midwest."}
{"text":"I've definitely had better. It was just your typical expensive airport food. Everything was priced almost twice as much as you'd expect. For example it was $13.99 - $14.99 for a burger, fries, and pickle chips. You're almost better off eating at the nearby Wendy's. It eventually went with their fish tacos. Service was however decent. She was quick, courteous, and always nearby to refill the water. The dining area felt a bit crammed, as most people had their bags and luggage with them.

*Mahi mahi fish tacos*
The waitress informed me that they were made with cod instead of mahi mahi. It was just 3 regular fish tacos, nothing out of the ordinary. They tasted good, but still did not really justify the cost.

Overall, I wouldn't eat here again unless I really don't want to eat fast food."}
{"text":"Wow I really wish I had read all the YELP reviews before ordering food from here!

I never expect airport food to be great, but decent where it is at least edible. The food here needs gel badly!

What upset me more was the attitude of our server.

I watched her literally have that \"disgusted look\" on her face, when a mother and son walked in and we're trying to decide where to sit, she felt they were in her way. Instead of politely saying excuse me, she went around them by going around other empty tables. You could see the annoyance on her face big time!

A restaurant is a \"service\" oriented business and this server did not have the ability to crack a smile.

I left my meal untouched to go get a meal from Chic-fil-A"}
{"text":"Stopped in at McCarran airport for breakfast. This place is overpriced - even by airport standards IMO - ordered scrambled eggs w/steak since bacon and sausage hate me - food was cold when I got it. Steak - which several people around me were eating - was blah! I left most of it on my plate along with the breakfast potatoes that were probably from the day before and dropped in the dryer for a 2nd time."}
{"text":"Best Cubano Sandwich ever...not a big fan of the fries but this sandwich is amazing!  My boyfriend an I always stop here when traveling!"}
{"text":"Food was surprisingly good. Prices are typical airport sit down. Staff was friendly and quick with the refils. The 4 stars is for the music

A week in Vegas and the rap, pop, disco duck bullshit makes me want to puke. Sammy Hagar owns this place so the music is hard rock all day!"}
{"text":"As a frequent business traveler I can attest that most airport restaurants are heinous...Sammy's at the Cleveland airport was especially heinous,  $20 for a plate of their version of shrimp tacos.  More like plankton tacos as the shrimp were tiny and there were only a few on each ice cold soft taco.  The meal and presentation (slopped on dressing on wilted greens) was disgusting.  Do they have a chef that knows how to prepare a meal or is it some kind of cruel joke?  Whichever, the joke is clearly on the customers...How could any celebrity have his name on such a shitaki hole?"}
{"text":"Overall the place was alrighty considering we are at the airport and there aren't too many options. This honestly was the best choice. 

The service was great. Had a lady names Stacy and she was enthusiastic and friendly which was nice. 

The chips and guac were alright. The guac may have been a little sus. The chips were fine. The chicken sandwich was alright, chicken was a bit sus, definitely wasn't fresh. But get we are at an airport. The tacos were a solid 8 according to my friend."}
{"text":"We were treated rudely upon entering by one waitress, she seemed annoyed we had a nine year-old with us.

We had a ninety minute layover, had once been to Sammy's in Cabo, figured we had liked it in Mexico, how bad could it be?

It was worse than bad.

The burger patty was the quality you might expect at Smart 'N Final. We asked the waitress if the hot dog was \"normal size\" or one of those extra large varieties, she replied, \"Oh, it's just a small, normal sized hot dog\"

This thing was huge, would make John Holmes blush!

Bartender had no clue what was meant by a \"vodka straight up\". How the hell can you tend bar and not know what \"straight up\" means?

Two cocktails, one burger, one hot dog, one quesadilla, chips and guacamole, $108.00!!

Money would have been better spent in a slot machine and I don't gamble."}
{"text":"If your in the mood for something tasty, starving or hungover and require substance Sammy's fits. I eat there regularly. Despite the many options I can't get past the Pastrami. It's really that good and I swore off pastrami for years. It opened me up again and I have never looked back. 

An insiders tip is to order the large sandwich and split it rather than order two smalls. The leftovers work which is a plus. Another tip - the lemonade actually something special!"}
{"text":"Did not know this restaurant had anything to do with Sammy Hagar until we sat down and looked at the menu. Does anyone really know who Sammy Hagar is if they didn't live through the 80's and 90's? 

Ordered lobster bisque. Not sure why. My gut feeling said no....but I ignored it. Regret. Soup bland. Served in a shallow bowl. Expensive. 

Ordered chicken tacos. Tortillas not cooked. Chicken was bland. 

I ordered a tiki drink that was super weak. It wasn't very sweet. 

Sat at the bar. The bartender was attentive. 

I'd say if you can avoid this place do so and go to Pei Wei not far up the way towards gate 9. 

My husband and I paid 63. Not including tip. It was the most expensive bland food I ever had."}
{"text":"After spending a few days in LV and spending lots of $$ on excellent meals (e.g. Tao), we were hoping to find a decent place for breakfast without the huge price tag. Sammy's delivered that and more. First off, the restaurant in immaculate, lot's of memorabilia, TVs (not too loud) - a a legit restaurant. Service is quick and friendly. Coffee was perfect. My wife and I both had the breakfast burritos, which were delicious. Yes, they are $12 - but you get a side of breakfast potatoes, which were crispy but NOT greasy. And, again, this is an AIRPORT in VEGAS so $12 seemed reasonable to me, especially since it was awesome. I opted for the $2 surcharge for the steak for my burrito and thoroughly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"They try and force you to buy a \"bottle of water for the plane\" vs just giving you a glass of water. When I asked the waitress to take the bottle back, she was clearly annoyed to have not \"made a sale.\"  The music playing is bothersome and the food marginal. Dry leathery steak.  I would avoid this place.  Yuck."}
{"text":"I was at the Las Vegas McCarren Airport walking around to kill some time before my flight and stumbled across this gem. I would describe it as an upscale sports bar. Great atmosphere, great food and great service. I sat at the bar and was immediately greeted by Daryn, one of the coolest bartenders. I ordered a double whiskey neat along with the Poppin' Dog. A Poppin' Dog is a foot long Kobe hotdog with bacon, pico de gallo and queso sauce. Check the pic...best hotdog I've had hands down. It also comes with chili cheese fries. Best part is they have a bunch of TV's so I was able to catch the beginning of the Knights game while I ate. Overall, Daryn and the other staff that assisted me were friendly and personable, the food was delicious and the price was totally reasonable. Exactly what I was looking for before my flight back home!"}
{"text":"Wish I had looked at Yelp before ordering. I ordered the Sammy's Big Beach Burger: melted jack & queso blanco cheese, bacon, guacamole and crispy onions $13.95. Ordered med...came out well, with no crispy onions and nasty rotten lettuce. The fries have big chunks of queso blanco queso that was suppose to be grated. My friend order a bowl of the Baja Seafood Bisque: Lobster meat, shrimp, bay scallops and chunks of sole in a sweet cream & sherry bisque with chopped green onions. Well it was watery and greasy with minuscule pieces of meat you would need a microscope for. Avoid! Go to one of the chain restaurants that have consistency. They took my burger back to make right and then the sent out rate and cold in middle. These guys do not know how to cook meat!"}
{"text":"The Good: sports on TV

The Bad: had one beer; just one. A Stella Artois. Bill was $11.66 for one beer! After tip, $14.16, for one glass of beer. I did not order a case, or a 12 pack, or a 6 pack, or 2 beers....just one beer!!!!"}
{"text":"The decor is OK.  The plasma/LCD screens are OK.  The food and drinks ... F!

Are you kidding me? 

Me and my lady get a burger, chicken sandi, two margaritas, two shots and the bill is $90?  What the?  

Should have gone next door to Popeyes Chicken ... 

Hey Sammy, David Lee Roth was better ... this place sucks."}
{"text":"This place is horrible, after waiting for over thirty minutes we walked out. Our waitress was horrible and rude not only to us but a few other people. I will never come back here, walk away and save yourself from a horrible experience. We asked for the manager and the waiter said he wasn't in. A restaurant with no manager, explains why the service sucks. A group of chimps could run this place better."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was our server by the name of Dawn.  I do not know how she does it. The place is a zoo, but she is able to keep all the animals calm."}
{"text":"This is a go to place for us at the airport. Seem to always be understaffed. But we like the atmosphere. 
Food and service mediocre. Today's service not so good. If this was our first time we would never come back."}
{"text":"Good airport food, not necessarily good service. I asked for my waiter and the woman literally yelled from one side of the restaurant to the other \"Jeffrey!!!\". A little embarrassing. I ordered the fish and chips, the fries were stale and left on the plate. THe fish was good. Not amazing but with hot sauce I enjoyed it enough to give this 2 stars. I asked what specials or nice cocktails they had and the server told me to just order a regular drink.... so I ordered water. Overall, it it was a quick meal before my flight,  I wouldn't go back though. The Wendys next door probably would have been a better option if I wanted a quick meal that was more tasty."}
{"text":"Why Sammy, Why?  The service here is terrible.  I don't have any Van Halen delussions.  This place sure isn't Panama and it's more like Running with the Devil (Waitstaff).

Avoid this place.  Hell, go to Wendy's next door.  At least you know full well the food will suck.  It'll be cheaper too."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. What can I say. This was about the worst airport food ever!

I ordered the bacon ommlet thinking bacon makes everything good. Not this time.  It was basically covered with cheese wiz straight from the can.  The wiz covered everything on the plate except for the toast which was burnt on side and cold on the other.  

The only good comment I can make is that the server was friendly and the serive was good.  If you are here and looking for breakfast, go to burger king as you'll have better food!"}
{"text":"Dear Sammy Hagar,

Why can't this be love?

You should be embarrassed to stamp your name on this dump. 1.5 oz is a standard shot in the US, and I'm sure you know, it's larger in Cabo. The whiskey that barely covered the bottom of the two glasses I purchased for 4 bucks a piece was a poor excuse for a shot and this is a poor excuse for a bar & grill. Can't wait to finish this beer and go over to Great Lakes to have a real drink.  I'll take it all back if you send me a bottle or an invite to Cabo! ;)"}
{"text":"Stopped off here in between flights on 6/18/11.  Ordered a $10.29 breakfast burrito.  Waitstaff asked if I wanted bacon or sausage.  Told her sausage.  When she presented the bill, my burrito went from $10.29 to $15.29.  We had the audacity to question it.  She told us we were being argumentative and it was posted on the menu.  It wasn't.  Asked for the manager.  After waiting for 5 mins, we finally went to her.  She said there was a $2 charge for bacon or sausage.  Shouldn't the waitress have mentioned that?  Or even be written in fine print on the menu?  Ok, so that takes care of $2 of the $5.  What's the rest?  Couldn't get an answer.  So BUYER BEWARE!  I guess they feel that they can overcharge because people are coming and going and most likely don't have time to actually LOOK AT THE BILL!!!  Miserable experience and the food wasn't even good.  Major customer service training needed at this location.  

Wished I'd checked with YELP first."}
{"text":"If you are looking for rude bartenders, and stale nachos this is the place for you.  Major attitude.....bad day, week, job not sure.?"}
{"text":"Wait staff is good, friendly and fairly speedy.

The food, however...GAH.  There aren't many places to eat in Terminal C so I'm assuming that's why they're still in business.  How do you mess up guacamole?  Cardboard-like chips.

I've been meaning to write this review for years and now that you can from my phone, they thoroughly deserve a two star rating."}
{"text":"Not sure how the food is because we didn't get a chance to eat. After wheeling in our grandma, lugging in our bags, seating ourselves, and preparing to order, we were told we needed to move the back corner of the restaurant behind a wall because we had members of our party under 21. No move was made by any of the employees to show us where we needed to be or to accomodate our grandmother in the wheelchair. After finding a table in the designated area and attempting to cram 5 people into a two person table, we decided to leave and just grab some fast food. Unfortunate that the service was so dissapointing, since I've heard the food was good."}
{"text":"Cold beer and the bartender takes care of bar customers right away. Other than that it's fairly standard. A plus for me, not right at the gates so more easy to get in and out."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a hot breakfast during a long layover. The place was hopping, and the waiter did his best to attend to the constant churn of customers with benign pleasantries. It's a diner, so don't expect haute cuisine. Do expect decent portions of standard fare. My Plain Jane breakfast came with two eggs (sunnyside up), whole wheat toast (butter and jelly), potatoes (ketchup, naturally), and two pieces of sausage. Checking out was relatively quick."}
{"text":"Nice relaxing place between flights with descent food! Friendly waitress and my only thing wrong with it; Need a Hostess!"}
{"text":"Well, they sure are friendly.

But speedy they are not.  The food that is, I wouldn't suggest stopping in if you're in a hurry but if you have some time to kill, the decor is nice and they don't rush you.

We had breakfast, the burrito is pretty good sized and the potatoes were crispy.  The yogurt and fruit plate was actually good sized as well.  Food was good, the pico on the burrito was sweet rather than spicy, but no complaints otherwise.  

Solid 3 stars for the food.  5 for the service."}
{"text":"I had been craving pancakes or French toast for 2 day's and popped in Sammy's Beach Bar & Grill while waiting to catch a flight. I HIGHLY recommend the Croissant French Toast!! It will absolutely melt in your mouth and is by far the best French Toast I've ever eaten!!  Well worth every cent!!!!  Since pictures say a thousand words, you can see from mine that the plate is empty!!  Loved it!!

The service was fantastic too. Great group of people there and I'll be a frequent visit anytime I'm in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant makes a good burger and as others have said delicious fries! Everything was a bit dry but had good flavor. It was a bit pricy for what we got but compared to everything else around it seemed to be a great option. The service was good and accurate and they got the food out to us fast. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"This was conveniently located near our gate so we sat down for breakfast in spite of the fact that Sammy Hagar tunes were blaring at 8am over static-y speakers. So irritating. Worst food I believe I've ever eaten or should I say, not eaten! Hard to ruin eggs, sausage, toast and hash browns. Burnt and overcooked. Bad enough we had to pay at all, but we were overcharged and had to wait around and listen to more delightful music while our bill was adjusted. I gave it one star cuz that's the only way I could get this to post! Steer clear!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. At least the profits support Sammy's charity. Dry over cooked cold hamburgers, cold fries (supposed to be spiced?), even the sodas were sub-par. The star is for Sammy and the decor. (do NOT taste the coleslaw...ew). No busboy so tables were dirty and dishes piled up. No system for clearing at all. Hard for the wait staff. :^( Tight space makes everyone schlepping their luggage block aisles, etc."}
{"text":"Service here sucks.  We got a seat and sat there for 12 minutes without being acknowledged and the waitress waited in 4 people that sat down after us.  We went over to Starbucks and got coffee and food. I never thought that I would say this but Starbucks has better prices also."}
{"text":"Well - let me begin with - don't come here if you have a gluten sensitivity... There is literally nothing on the menu unless you're fine eating a salad with oil and (white) vinegar .. Not even balsamic.... I guess it isn't exactly the end of the world ..however - I had the beach salad which was only \"ok\" at best .. I'm not even certain the chicken wasn't some sort of processed pile of chicken pieces molded into the shape of a chicken breast... Had I not been absolutely starving .. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have eaten it.. Adding to the food disappointment was the service... Lisa is as friendly as a rattlesnake... And her attempt to appear \"friendly\" really just comes off as OVER THE TOP Fake and rude.. She definitely hates her job.. I would never eat here again ...."}
{"text":"This is a great little place in the airport.  Tall cold draft beers, damn good food. Super busy always though for sure."}
{"text":"Terrible service and the top shelf margarita deserves to be called bottom shelf margarita. No booze what so ever in it. Only place in this place to get food or drink. Ugh"}
{"text":"Eww.... yes the spot is in the Las Vegas air port. It's disgusting. The place is dirty and they have no hostess. The food was gross, I ordered chicken tacos which came with a side of French fries. The fries were great. The tacos not so much..... how can you mess up a simple chicken taco?! Well it's not hard just use the cheapest frozen heat and serve chicken on the market and your in. One bit of my taco and I was chewing a piece of chicken like a rawhide, cow ear. It was hard an black and disgusting. How could they ever use this piece of meat? Surly didn't taste like chicken. It was horrible. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Worst food I've had in a long time. Very disappointed!! Thought Fish & chips were safe...nope! Disgusting! Nachos taste like quick 7/11 or movie theater nachos. Sent them back, couldn't even eat them. Toughed out the over cooked, greasy fish & chips. Who messes up Fish & Chips!?!?"}
{"text":"Overpriced, crappy service, small portions, stale french fries, etc. Even for airport food, this is pretty bad.

There really isn't too much to say - if you must get food here, get something hard to mess up, like chicken fingers (at $12 for four of them plus a small handful of fries). 

You should be hoping that that they get their chicken precooked in a bag, so as long as they're hot you're in good shape and you're not risking food poisoning.

My impression is that the drinks are pretty good, albeit once again overpriced. I had a Sam lager that set me back $9."}
{"text":"The only thing more sickening than the burger was the relentless glam rock.  I, along with most other reviewers, wish I had just gone to the Wendy's next door."}
{"text":"We were hesitant to eat here since our experience at the Ohio Airport Sammy's was terrible. But this Vegas Sammy's was fantastic! Our server was super friendly and our food was super delicious! 

The Sammy's Beach Burger was amazing! Perfectly done with a huge guacamole scoop, perfectly cooked bacon and melted cheddar! The seasoned fries with queso fresco are just as amazing! 

Sure...\"airport\" prices but it's just as much as going to a restaurant outside the airport and the quality for what you pay for is up to par."}
{"text":"I feel like I broke the Yelp code with coming to this place!! There's a reason why I AM a Yelper and I failed to summon my powers by checking the reviews of this place! I wish I would have Yelped this before sitting down and ordering! Sure, it was convenient to eat here just because my terminal was literally in front...all because I was being lazy! Never again! With this said, do yourself a favor and look at the horrendous pictures and reviews and walk to the nearest exit before placing an order as you WILL be DISSAPOINTED! 

My bf and I shared the nachos, a water, and a sprite all for $20+ dollars for a few chips, measly pieces of chicken (most likely grilled frozen chicken strips) with a terrible chimichurri sauce that did not go well with the nachos. We had thought about sharing because for the price, we figured they would be a large order but if we had looked at the pictures on Yelp, we would've realized that: 

1. the portion size was too small and we should have each ordered our own meal
2. pictures do not look good and are not worth the price! 

To top it all off, the service itself was terrible! There was only one waitress and she wasn't very good either! We practically waited the entire hour that we had available for one shared meal and we had to get her attention multiple times to close our check. We ended up being the last to board our flight because she took forever to bring our card back! 

I'm telling you, if I hadn't been so hungry and didn't have a long flight, I would've skipped the meal altogether!"}
{"text":"This is a really good place for breakfast.  The waitress was friendly and the egg and bacon burrito was killer."}
{"text":"Stopped by Sammy's in the airport before leaving Las Vegas. Not bad at all. Had the Asada Burger and fries. The burger was really sloppy with stuff falling out upon delivery, but very good. The seasoned fries had Feta cheese and I'm guessing lime juice. Very flavorful, almost overpowering. Cool guitars, photos and video slideshows of Sammy and Co. Throughout. Cool staff, too. I'll try another place next time, just to change things up, but I'm glad I checked them out."}
{"text":"Most worthless raggedy place in the entire airport!! I have never in all my life had such awful service at any place. I would have rather ate from a vending machine. Service was flat out awful. Never had such bad service, rude waitress, forgot about us over and over. The place was busy but they had several waitresses working there. They should have been able to do far better. Just awful!
They don't even deserve 1 star"}
{"text":"In rush and hungry? Go here.. order the beach nachos. They whipped it up quick and the avocado crema was very tasty. I sat at the bar for quicker service. Service was  on point and checked in on me since I was in a rush."}
{"text":"Hit the spot and what's funny is that they are the most reasonable thing I paid for in Las Vegas. I had a wrap and it was delicious. Great service too!"}
{"text":"what a joke.....more expensive than most of the other bar/restaurants in the airport, service sucks......watched our bartender fixing her hair, behind the bar, with her bare hands, in plain view, then continue to make drinks and serve guests, WITHOUT WASHING HER HANDS!!!!. we had 1 drink each, which wasn't very good.......how do you screw up a bloody mary when using bottled mix? took off and went over to quaker steak & lube and panini's, both better choices than this crappy place.....i guess it's fitting that sammy hagar's name is on this place, it sucks, just like his music!"}
{"text":"We were starved and it looked so inviting....Looks can be deceiving. The menu is sparse, okay I get it. But just because it's inside the airport doesn't mean you have to throw quality out the door. Look in my younger days I was in love with Sammy Hagar..haha...But dooode....really what makes you think just because you can sing, you can open a fast foodish restaurant. It was really mediocre and the wait staff, personalities of turnips. My husband says \" what do you expect they work at the airport\". I say \"hey a job is a job, so some enthusiasm that you are getting a paycheck\" geez...... Okay I guess it would work in a pinch, when you need some fuel and to rest your weary bones...and they do have cocktails and brews....."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Decent food - better airport quality here!
As another yelper put it, how desperate are you at an airport to find something to eat that isn't fast food before you get on the plane? 

Sammys had horrible service, the server was very rude, which immediately turned me off from the place. Children and families are not very welcome and must sit in this area that feels like you've been voted off the island. It's roped off, and once you are there, it's impossible to get a servers attention!

We ordered shrimp chivche, which was really just prawns in salsa. It was served with no chips, in a martini glass, and a styrofoam playe - all which I found odd. It was refreshing and a good light snack.

I ordered a cocktail from the bar, it was so awful, I sent it back. They replaced it with a beer, which can't be messed up.

My kids had garlic cheese fries whch were an excellet bar snack! The guacamole was canned/made with sour cream, not really guacamole if you ask me. 

Pro: good salsa!
Con: everything else"}
{"text":"Sammy Hagar really needs to take his name off this place because I think I'm starting to like his music less as a result of dining here.  The food is mediocre, but not poor, and is airport priced.  The drinks and service really kill it though.  Service is nearly always slow, and the drinks are some of the worst I've encountered.  Even if you get a double, it's going to be weak, and then you'll be out $16 or so.  How does someone who's in rock & roll, AND has his own line of tequila, have his name on a bar that serves weak overpriced drinks?!

I'd go back to eat here if I'm in the mood for cantina-style food, but if I feel like drinking I'm going to keep walking."}
{"text":"Food was terrible.  I got a carnitas sandwich which tasted more like a sloppy joe and a bad sloppy joe to boot! I ordered mojito and later told that they were our of mint but asked if I wanted it anyway...wtf? A mojito without mint?

The service was even worse, took them 10 minutes to acknowledge my presence and take my order. Waitresses stood around giggling in the back instead of taking care of customers

Seriously. ..Avoid this place"}
{"text":"Chicken Quesadilla, and a Ice Cold Beer while you wait for a flight. Yum!

With lots of douchey pictures of Sammy Hagar around the place, while you wait for your food you start to think about rock stars and their money, and what they do with it. So they have a video screen with a Sammny Hagar slide show for your enjoyment.. yep, you get to see lots of pictures of the man with the frizzy blonde hair, and the black shades. There's even a picture of him posing in front of his Ferrari. Enjoy!!

I also got a slice of their chocolate cake, which was awesome. All of the food was good, under $20.00, and the bar tender was a great guy, and really on top of things. I was in a hurry to eat and run, and he got it done."}
{"text":"Airport restaurant so what do you expect. Fun fact; Sammy Hagar is the in-house DJ so he's voicing the intros and outros to all the rockin' rock hits they blast through the speakers. We really wanted chips and queso but they only had nachos. The food was meh. And overpriced. But what do you expect at the airport."}
{"text":"Drinks are great, I mean how can you mess up a bloody mary?  However,  the smallest wings I have ever spent that much money on."}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant: 5-stars. I can't believe the low yelp reviews because we had a good experience. Prompt friendly service, well prepared food, and good drinks (although very pricey)."}
{"text":"Great service at this airport restaurant. I had the eggs with queso fresco and it was good. Ms. Wanda was our server and she was the nicest plus gave us great service in the AM! They also had sugar free red bull which made it a plus."}
{"text":"Stopped in at the airport for a quick bite. Service was super fast and the food was wonderful!! one of the top nachos I have ever had and the beach salad was amazing. Totally shocked for airport food. We will come here again!"}
{"text":"Worst food ever!!!! Nachos were disgusting, cheese sauce was cold. If you could pull it out of a can, they use it. Nothing was fresh...ugh! Chicken fingers were cheap frozen fingers you find at low end fast food places. Save your money!!!!! Burger King would have been a better choice."}
{"text":"Came in right on time to catch the Knights game and to grab something to eat before my flight.  You can seat yourself at any table as you walk in.  

The menu serves a variety of options but I went for what they were famous for, the Cubano.  The sandwich was pretty good somewhat better than other Cubano sandwiches I have tried.  It also
comes with fries which is a plus.  The prices are
typical for the airport but I didn't expect a draft beer to cost $10.50, almost as much as the sandwich but hey the knights just won, it's a celebration!  

The service was on point and was acknowledged right away with any questions I may have.  Definitely recommend if you want to catch a game and eat but in terms of drinks go somewhere else."}
{"text":"If you're catching an early flight and looking for breakfast... Keep moving! Trust me. You'll soon regret stopping here as there are much better (and cheaper) breakfast options in the terminal. Keep going. 

30 bucks for two bland eggs and frozen potatoes entrees. Yuck. 

Bartender was nice so they get an extra star."}
{"text":"I don't even want to give this place one star! It took over thirty minutes to get our food! I expect high prices in a airport but 15 bucks for a hard dried up burger!? I wanted the Cuban and was told they was out of pork and chicken and it was only 11:30 am. Next time I'll know to walk right past it."}
{"text":"Food too cold and fries are
Not kicked up!! Barely any season or cheese. Looks like the leftovers. Staff is friendly and attentive. Giving Hagar a bad name need to have a pow wow with the cooks!!"}
{"text":"After landing at McCarran starving for dinner, we stopped at Sammy's because the interior looked fun and inviting, and there was a sign prominently displayed out front touting that it had made a list by Travel + Leisure or another highly-acclaimed travel publication as one of the top 10 airport restaurants in America.

Sadly, this was another typical airport restaurant experience: overpriced and nothing to write home about.

Seating is first come, first serve and open seating - which isn't obvious at first. Note that the majority of the restaurant is 21+ so this might not be the best choice for families.

Service was fine and food was speedy. I got the burger (safe bet at an airport restaurant) and it was again, fine. 

I did like how there is a buzzer at each table to ring for ordering and requesting the check.

I'll likely skip Sammy's next time and just grab something quick at a fast food favorite or grab n go."}
{"text":"My only complaint about Sammy's is that I wasn't asked how I wanted my burger cooked. It arrived medium-well (very faint pink in the middle), and was surprisingly juicy and delicious, in spite of being cooked a little more than I would have requested. The queso fresco & guacamole on my Big Beach Burger were unexpected yet tasty toppings! I also enjoyed the plentiful steak-cut fries. My cranberry & vodka cocktail was strong, and I didn't even order the double. Service here at Sammy's was efficient & pleasant, plus the tunes were great. I also enjoyed the rock-n-roll themed decor. Prices seemed a bit high, even for airport food, but I enjoyed my meal & will definitely return."}
{"text":"$15 sub-par burgers. $17 margarita. Way too expensive for the quality of the food and drink. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Decent food but only one server for the whole place! He was amazing but no human could keep up with the crowds so service really suffered. This place seriously needs to reassess its operations. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Maybe it's an interaction with the hummus or kalamata olives, but boy, this tastes like that cheap ass Sysco ketchup. The \"Southern Peach Tea\" had little to no peach flavor. Chicken Hummus Wrap was OK. 

The fries would have been better with decent ketchup or even fancy catsup. 

Underwhelming, just like my last visit to a Sammy's ten years ago."}
{"text":"I wish I had read the reviews before I'd gotten the food. Got a sandwich and fries. Both were mediocre at best and looked like they may have come straight from a package. But this is a sit down place! Would have been better off grabbing some grub at the newspaper shop."}
{"text":"0 stars. The Service here was completely subpar. Not friendly in any meaning of the word. Felt like I was being rushed to leave the entire time. They were even rude enough to put breakfast glasses on my table (I was eating dinner at 8pm) in an effort to hurry me along. The one and only salad was mediocre, but drenched in dressing. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Didn't take any food pics this round. Service was average, food was average. Nothing exceptional but for airport food I was fine with what we got..."}
{"text":"Overall, meh. The fries are seriously not worth the excessive price, plus all they have is ketchup. I didn't like them enough to bother eating more than a couple.  The seafood bisque was ok, but again not worth the price since they serve it in a bowl 1/4 utilized. Even adjusting for airport gouging, my overall experience was that it was overpriced, service was just ok, and it wasn't even clean - I had to wipe down my own table. It took forever to get my check, too.

Also, I refuse to order drinks when they don't list the prices. Automatic price jacking, there. 

I fly out of this airport 2-3 times a month, too bad I'll never return to this entirely over -hyped cantina."}
{"text":"Wow.....not good.  Smallest piece of chicken on my chicken sandwich I've ever seen and the fries were bad too.  Good service, but really over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"Here's the thing, Southwest Terminal 1 travelers:  This is it, no choice if you want to sit before taking off - yes, taking off.  Because if you stop here after a flight you're nutty - Vegas has some great food to offer 24/7.

The service earned two of those stars - prompt and efficient, as any good airport sit down is, pleasant, too - never take that for granted!

Here's the thing, though...  a had a breakfast omelette that was just as dirty blonde as Sammy himself - zero color in spite of a great blend of typically colorful ingredients.  It tasted 'ok' and was the only game in town."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some breakfast.    Waitress was good and the breakfast hit the spot.    I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Food was really good! Drinks were watered down and the waitress was terrible. Terrible customer service. Carne Asada Melt was great."}
{"text":"I think I had the Beach Salad with chicken pre-flight. It was actually pretty good, as the waitress recommended."}
{"text":"To keep it short and sweet, absolutely horrible food. We had two margaritas (super sickly sweet with no hint of alcohol), two beers (Goose Island IPA, so not horrendous), and an entree each (there were two of us - I had the fish and chips which tasted like fish sticks with crunchy fries and weird aioli. Boyfriend had a Cubano sandwich which was soggy and stale at the same time). The MOST painful bill I've ever signed at $95 including tip. Not worth your time! I felt like telling people to walk away as we were leaving!"}
{"text":"The worst service in the airport. Servers act like you are totally putting them out if you ask them to even wipe a dirty table off. The worst!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Chips and guac weren't awesome at all. Chips didn't feel fresh. The guac was chunky, but pieces of jalapeno were unequal and few. Burgers are made well done \"by policy\" so that's a shame. Fries are ok, little garlic on it. Food came out quick. Overall for an airport restaurant, it does below average on quality, but excellent on time."}
{"text":"Good great place to grab a bite to eat when your plane is delayed!! Really good food and really good drinks. I had a Bloody Mary and it was really good.  Staff is friendly I do believe Sammy would be proud to know the service is great.  We had beer battered fish tacos and casedea. No complaints"}
{"text":"What a sad crappy place. Crappy wine $15 a glass! ... and a sad ol rusty lettuce salad. Disgusting. Doesn't deserve even 1 sad little star."}
{"text":"Food wasn't too bad, but the place isn't managed. There was a waiting line to get in and there was 2 tops pulled together to form 4 tops, with one person sitting there. No one seating, hosting or even crowd control. Service was very slow. Stephanie,,, find another line of work. You're way too slow and not very observant. Silverware and napkins come before the meal not 5 minutes into it."}
{"text":"I didn't have high expectations given the other Yelp reviews and the fact that it was airport food, but I wanted to try the croissant french toast, which seemed novel. While the vanilla yogurt drizzle had a unique and tasty flavor, the entire dish came somewhat cold, the underside of the croissant was burnt, and the two tiny pieces of bacon were as hard as rocks and nearly blackened. Definitely not worth over $10.

What disappointed me most of all was the deceit of the waitress. I was never informed that those two ridiculous pieces of bacon would cost me an additional $1.50. Neither is this surcharge listed anywhere on the menu. Although \"meat\" wasn't in the description for what I ordered, the way she asked \"bacon or sausage\" in a definitive manner gave me the impression that it was included with the dish rather than as an additional option. The fact that customers have to specifically ask whether they'll be charged more shows just how poorly the establishment is doing to find it necessary to trick people. I've never given a 1-star to any restaurant, and I'm not a picky person when it comes to food, but the experience I had here was absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"This place is a disaster. Waitress completely out of it. Lettuce in my water. Milky wet substance on silverware. Screwed up orders for 2 out of 4 in our party. Burger was completely cold through. Barf."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst breakfast burrito I've ever had. Not only was it gross, but they charge extra for bacon and cheese. So for $15, you get a greasy tortilla filled with scrambled eggs, bacon and cheese product. Oh, and a gracious helping of sour cream on top. Bleh!

Service was fine - my waiter was perfectly pleasant. But the prices and quality were pretty offensive.

Maybe I'd come back for a margarita or chips and salsa? Def not for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to this location at the C gate at the airport to get a quick breakfast before my flight.  They were fast but the food was lukewarm and the potatoes were tough and had clearly been sitting for awhile.  I would normally sent it back but didn't have time. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Expensive 31.87 dollars for awful food and worse service should have gone to Wendy's  Put my order in wrong and acted like he didn't and three tables to wait on didn't fill coffee cup once without being asked"}
{"text":"We ate here on our way out of the city.  I thought there'd be decent food here but this adds to the perception that airport food is not that good.

I really don't have much to say except that if you're on your way out, don't stop by here."}
{"text":"I am genuinely surprised at the ratings. Sammy's Beach Bar and Grill is an excellent restaurant. Considering it is an airport restaurant, it is then bumped up to REALLY EXCELLENT. 

The food was good and reasonably priced. We ordered the salad with grilled chicken, chili, and fries. The salad was HUGE and yummy. The chili was perfect: hot, without beans, and had perfect consistency. The chili was served with a side of tortilla chips that were also really good. The fries were flavored with garlic and also had grilled garlic chunks in the pile. It was also topped off with some cheese and seasoning. What I liked most about the food was that it seemed that they actually put effort into it. I liked it, and I wish they had a Sammy's at more airports. if you are in a rush, though, you should try something else. Sammy's is more of a sit-down spot and the food takes a while to come out. 

When I come back, I am definitely trying the cocktails that looked super satisfying!"}
{"text":"I'll give it 3 stars cause the tortilla chicken soup was actually pretty good... I'd give it more had the waitress not referred to the Ahi tuna tacos as Ali tuna... Not evening joking..."}
{"text":"Waiting on my flight, stopped in for breakfast.  This was really not the best for me.  Wished I just went with one of the fast food breakfast options.  Flavors just didn't work that great together.  Service was good though."}
{"text":"Because the Diet Coke didn't taste like Chlorine, I am allowing one star. I know it's an airport bar. I know we didn't have much choice. But the hamburger actually tasted like a grade school cafeteria burger only fatter and more disgusting. The \"kicked up\" fries, all five of them on the plate, had no seasoning at all. Not even a smidgen of salt. The server didn't seem to be bothered by the fact that we were, in fact, in an airport next to a Gate. Clearly indicating we were catching a flight somewhere and time was of the essence. All in all, we will never, ever eat there again. I'd rather spend my time opening miniature bags of peanuts. Worth the money? No way."}
{"text":"The Croissant French Toast with brown sugar and strawberries was a great, lite breakfast before the flight home.   

Angelina, our server provided excellent service.   She was happy and fast.  I asked to seat us near an electrical outlet, so no more sitting on the airport carpet charging my phone.  

Nice, relaxing, tasteful place.  You must get a bite to eat or a drink here when leaving Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Nice spot to hang your bags yntil your flight.  Service is prompt and friendly.  I had an Alaskan Amber and grill chicken sandwich with fries.  Delicious food.  Highly recommend if your in Terminal C."}
{"text":"Where do I start? I ordered a chicken sandwich and asked to add cheese and the old lady who was taking my order looked at me like I was crazy. She didn't understand what I meant by \"can I add cheddar please?\". Anyways, she finally figured it out and the food came.... It was below average at best (but the French fries were alright). I finished dinner right when Game 7 of the NBA finals tipped off and after getting basically yelled at by the same waitress when I asked if she could please turn the game on (BTW... who doesn't have the biggest game of the year on any of the 5 tvs until after it started...) they finally turned the game on  1 TV (what a joke). Everyone around was upset that we missed tip off. After this ordeal, I was then told I couldn't stay unless I ordered drinks (even though I spent $15 on garbage food and left over a 20% tip). I ended up staying a bit longer (nobody said anything).

Long story short, every single employee I interacted with showed little to no common courtesy and they all had attitudes. Oh, and the dude bartending was a complete weirdo."}
{"text":"We stopped in to grab some breakfast on our way out. Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. We had the Plain Jane Egg Breafast, great portions and tasty. 

Place is clean and not loud like a lot of Vegas eateries.

Mike the bartender is a great guy, friendly and interested in making conversation.

Good for Sammy Hagar! You are on to something dude."}
{"text":"Some of the best airport food I have had. Ordered the Sammy's Beach Burger and it was amazing.  We also ordered the nachos and it was a big plate.  Food came out in less than 10 minutes.  Drinks are $10-$15, but seems like most drink here are s little pricier."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and the service was great. Not too busy and a nice find away from the busy section of this terminal. Quick food, drinks, and service. The food was clean, fresh, and didn't make me sick. That's all you can hope for with airport food!"}
{"text":"Bad service, no greeters, one of the waitress was very rude. Literally rolling her eyes and went to complain to another waitress just because I ask for a few more minutes to look at the menu.  Zero stars...."}
{"text":"Next time i will just walk past this place. The service is just not friendly and a bit slow. We came in for a drink and a bite to eat. The food was just not that great kinda just slapped together and the drink i had the mai tai was not a mai tai at all. Tables were just a bit sticky. It just wasn't a good experience at all."}
{"text":"Wings had some type of glue mix on the outside. Sound system, of all things given its SAMMY, was scratchier than Ted nugents cat"}
{"text":"IDon't understand why Sammy's got so many negative reviews, perhaps it's their foods.

However, I never ate here so I am writing for their bar service. Very nice and friendly staffs. They chilled and chatted with you while you are sitting at the bar. Nothing else I will be asking for."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick cup of coffee and breakfast during a connecting flight. Bartenders 2 guys, I forgot there names are awesome. Coffee was well, coffee and the omelette was delicious. For 'airport' food this place exceeded all my expectations and I will be remembering this for further food needs while in the vegas airport. We travel here a lot so that's a plus. Cheers."}
{"text":"Just okay even by airport food standards. I just had hummus and shared some chips and salsa but others at the table exercised the menu options pretty well. No one was impressed. The food in general wasn't exceptionally tasty - for example, the salsa was watered down and then thickened. It looked like salsa but it didn't taste all that much like salsa."}
{"text":"Good service. Interesting options for breakfast.  Croissant French toast isn't the greatest idea when croissant's are too soft for the egg mixture.  My son said the bacon was perfectly crisp and had a great flavor.  Otherwise we (OK more like me) came for the atmosphere.  Its Sammy-sphere natch!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible - do not waste your time! Pick up a Starbucks next door and keep moving."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped here after having our flight delayed. The first drink I order was a pomegranate mojito and it was not good. They placed soda in the mojito and completely lost the taste of the mint. After sending it back I asked for a Mai Tai and that was much better. Next our food arrived after what seemed forever. I ordered the nachos and my friends order the kicked-up fries. My nachos were not good. The meal was cold and the chicken was way sweet. There was barely any cheese on them and barely any of the not so good chicken. I don't think I'll be eating here on my next visit."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money here. Mediocre food. Just hit one of the better fast food spots in the airport. My \"beach salad\" was majorly disappointing. My friends got the nachos which were decent but not worth $15. I ended up buying a pizza 2 hours elsewhere I was so hungry. One thing positive: tt looks cool inside."}
{"text":"I ordered the quesadillas and they missed the mark on flavor. The menu itself is pretty underwhelming and it is just some overpriced \"beach\" food."}
{"text":"I was hungry and had a short time before I had to catch a flight so I ate here despite the reviews on Yelp.  I had Sammy's Cubano Sandwich which has pork shoulder, ham, Swiss cheese, pickles and spicy brown mustard (no aiolli for me) and had it with the Kicked Up Fries which is fries with queso fresco and red chili spice.  I was very pleased with my meal.  

The service was speedy but could have been more friendly.  The prices are what you would except to pay at an airport.  I was just passing through so I probably won't eat here again but, A-OK."}
{"text":"I thought this place wasn't bad especially for airport food. The place is kinda small so moving around with luggage is a bit of a hassle. I advise sitting in the area near the wall so you can place the luggage there without it being in the way (you sit yourself).

The waitress that served us was quite nice and food comes out super fast. Great for people who need to catch their flight! The chicken sandwich was pretty bomb and I would definitely eat here/order that again~"}
{"text":"If you like snail service and tasteless food then step right on up folks! You too can be disappointed :-) 

I normally don't expect much from some airport food buy come on, how can you serve fries that look like they were sunbathing in the dessert and then put into a dehydrator. Oh did I mention that they were also cold?? I thought I played it safe with a chicken sandwich with cheese and that too was bland. Oh did I mention cold as well after waiting over 30mins to get it togo???

Please stop hiring ppl who couldn't care less if your food is presentable nor care if the customers are pleased."}
{"text":"Ay Dios mio.  So, as it turns out, I was supremely earlier for my flight to visit family for Memorial Day weekend. I decided to enter the C terminal Sammy's because I was looking for an alcoholic beverage and nachos.

As I found an open seat at a communal table, I made myself comfortable.  Which was a good idea, since despite making eye contact with the server several times, it took her almost ten minutes to get over to me.  I saw that she was busy, but in the time I was there, she immediately spoke to a well-dressed business man as he was being seated.  (Tip deduction-normally, I tip 20%, reduced to 15% to show my displeasure.)

They didn't have the Pinot Gris listed on the menu, only one other for $3 more.  Fine.

I ordered the $12 grilled chicken sandwich because $17 for nachos seems crazy to me and I decided that since I wasn't likely to finish it, a waste of money.  

Watched as my food sat on the pass for several minutes.  (Ugh)

Watched another server do something not health dept approved.  What's the point of pulling off the bottom of the paper of the straw, if you are going to us your fingers to put the straw in the cup?  You might as well stick your dirty fingers in the person's cup.  

When I got my sandwich, the mayo packet that came with it was open and crusty.  (Obviously, did not use.). I ate my food and prayed for no foodborne illnesses.  The chicken looked cooked through, even though it was chewy.

Note to self, get alcoholic drink at bar and eat at a fast food place where at least they having a passing knowledge of food safety."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I needed to eat lunch in the McCarran Airport before we boarded our flight back home and the only place we found that had tables to sit down and relax was Sammy's Beach Bar & Grill, located in the Southwest terminal. I give it one star because it was the only restaurant we could find and another star because the food was edible and the service decent. I ordered the three fish tacos, which consisted of a frozen square fish stick with some corn pieces, thousand island-style dressing all wrapped in a tortilla, not really what I expected and I cannot recommend. My boyfriend ordered the chicken strips with fries and received burnt frozen chicken strips with cold fries. He requested new fries, which came as he was finishing up his burnt frozen chicken strips, again, cannot recommend. The price tag for these two mediocre (at best) meals, a soda and a beer was $43.00 before tip. Next time, we will either make sure we eat before we arrive at the airport or choose a fast food chain that would have been half the cost for the same mediocre, unsatisfying food..."}
{"text":"If you think Sammy Hagar's music sucks, wait till you try his cooking! This was by far the worst restaurant I've ate at in a long time. They are lucky to be the only place to eat in terminal A. Otherwise, this place would not exist. Half an hour to make a breakfast burrito. Overpriced even by airport standards. Mediocre food quality. Seriously, this place is a joke."}
{"text":"I have passed Sammy's a couple times in the airport and walked on by like Isaac Hayes. There is a picture of Sammy Hagar in white linen looking very at peace like an older hillbilly White Iverson. Sammy's is nothing more than a place to drink while waiting for a plane. People need to either wait to their destination to eat or stop expecting dumpy airports to serve them their foodie-Yelp-Instagram wet dream on a dirty plate."}
{"text":"Sooo I figured I was taking a risk at this place because its covered in photos of this dude that looks like Guy Fieri's older brother. Later I learned its actually a famous rock and roll hall of fame inducted musician. 

Anyway I wasnt feeling well so I order the bowl (they offer a smaller cup version) of tortilla soup. It wasnt bad but it tasted like college food. For one thing mayb they ran out of big bowls because what they brought out was two small bowls of soup.The tortilla soup tasted canned like Campbells soup, they put a couple tortilla chips in it and a scoop or surprisingly fresh guac. 

It wasnt bad it just didnt taste like restaurant food"}
{"text":"Go to the Bar! Find Nev! Beach Salad is large but I ate it all. This place is for every traveler."}
{"text":"Service was very, very bad. Food was average. I think Sammy Hagar should stay the heck out of the food industry, it's obviously not his bag."}
{"text":"My giant beer was great but pricey as always considering its an airport bar. The quesidilla was gross, guacamole tasted like it was a powder they added water to and plopped it on from a piping bag. Wont eat here every again may just have liquid food."}
{"text":"Honestly, I hate to be the hater but the food here was awful and the wait staff was extremely slow.

However, I do feel sightly bad because the wait staff, even though slow, were extremely friendly people.  I will not say to avoid this place because they are nice people, just proceed with extreme caution."}
{"text":"Although its airport food its still a chain restaurant. It was busy and service was terrible. Our order got lost and we were promised a discount. We never got the discount. Our waitress, Gina, had a little bit of an attitude. Burger was sub par fries were ok."}
{"text":"I love Sammy Hagar! This is a must-go place for me. The beer selection,both on tap or bottles, is pretty slim and the menu is small- that's the only reason this place looses a star for me. I just love eating at Sammy's place."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm really shocked at some of the reviews  here. This place  is great. I got the burger and it was delicious."}
{"text":"The service here is pretty good. The waitress was nice. She asked me if I was over 21 and I was confused because I didn't order any alcohol (I am over 21 btw) but I found out that you have to be over 21 to sit in the area I was sitting in and there is a separate area for anyone who is under 21. 

The food is alright not spectacular and not horrible. It's ok. Kinda over priced but it is airport food so I guess that's expected. 

I would actually rather come here than the other places because at least it's not fast food and food will get served to you. There is a bad inside .. Clearly since the name includes it. 

Wouldn't mind stopping back here again if I'm at the Vegas airport."}
{"text":"The menu posted by the entrance does not have prices for a reason. The food is all overpriced. The food is standard food service supply items, prepared in mediocre fashion."}
{"text":"Best airport food I've ever had!
Glad Sammy won't accept mediocrity. 
Fish and chips was awesome. The aioli and jalapeño sauces were first class. 
Bartender - as great as the food. 
Thanks."}
{"text":"It was okay for airport food. It doesn't stick out in the memory as a great place, but also not as a bad place, so I suppose that's good."}
{"text":"Service and food are ok. About what you would expect from a restaurant in an airport. Nachos and fries were good but the chicken fingers were loaded with breading."}
{"text":"Had the grilled chicken sandwich it was pretty tasted the fries are really good. Service was good and the place was clean"}
{"text":"You never expect to have amazing food at an airport, and on that front it still holds true as a concept.  However, after having stopped in a few times and with some time on my hands a review should be offered.

We've had tacos here and burgers, but this time it was the chicken sandwich.  Good choice on my part.  The average rating is derived from the lack of cleanliness.  Probably not really this places fault, but man that airport drives me crazy with the feeling of grossness."}
{"text":"This place blows. Way overpriced, even for an airport. Service is horrible. Drinks are pre-made, nothing fresh about them. Food, mud butt in your future. AVOID this place. I've been to 35 countries, this is by far, the worst place I've ever been in an airport."}
{"text":"Pretty decent for airport nachos. The $7 coronas are cold but come on. Oh yeah - it's in the airport."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a bite to eat before my flight.  I ordered the Beach Nachos with chicken which were good.  I asked the waitress could I make a meal out of them (since they were listed under appetizers) to which she said 'yes'.  After I was done eating, I could have eaten more.  So if you are really hungry, this may not be the best option.

The nachos did not have a great deal of cheese (melted versus shredded), which for me who loves cheese, was not impressive.  So if you are one who does not like a lot of cheese on your nachos, this would be right up your alley.

They definitely had a unique taste to them.  This could have been largely due to the Chimichurri dressing, guacamole and black bean cream sauces.  Definitely different, but good.

There were quite a few TVs over the bar area which you could here, as well as music being played over the entire restaurant.  The music was just the right volume, not too loud but at a volume that was enjoyable.

There were a lot of tables in the restaurant and it was very crowded.  As the title says, not a great deal of space to move around in, but overall not too bad."}
{"text":"Slow service...AMAZING french fries! Food is good with an airport price point. Eat here only if you have a bit of a layover."}
{"text":"I would give this no stars if possible.  To start, we walked in & the table we wanted to sit at was soaking we,t from a dirty rag they used to wipe it down, so I asked the bartender (who was just standing there doing nothing but staring into space) if I could have a napkin. All he did was point to the waitress across the room, who was talking to another waitress. All while the bartender was standing next to a huge pile of napkins by the servers station.  All I could say was \"wow\".
So we looked over the menu and decided to order the bacon cheese burger.  First, the burger was half the size of the bun and the bacon looked like they bought it from the same place Wendy's buys there bacon. Actually I 100% would have preferred and would have been more satisfied with Wendy's Bacon Cheeseburger compared to this one. So not only was the burger small & the bacon below par, the bottom bun was soaked in grease! How terrible and disgusting it was. It came with fries which were also soaked in grease & soggy.  

Sammy Hagar should be ashamed to have his name attached to this place. You're better off going to McDonalds. You'll feel a lot less ripped off!"}
{"text":"Worst service known to mankind. Only reason why they survive is convenience. Servers have attitude and don't care if they give service or not. That's ok. Guess they don't care if they get tipped or not. Decent beer if you get it before it get warm. 

Go to fast food place. This place sucks and deserves to go out of business"}
{"text":"Simple order...bowl of soup and a beer. Took 15 min for soup to come out and it was cold. Waitress rude when I asked to send soup back. Second bad experience here. Won't be back to this place even though it's right by the gate I use every Thursday night."}
{"text":"2017 Yelp 100 Challenge!
78/100

Located in Gate C - right pass gate C24

Moment we arrived (around 10am ish) we were just told \"Sit anywhere!\"..really?? - okay~

As we sat down we looked into the menu and everything sound pretty good! So we decided to order the following:

- Fish n Chips: OK but hardly any seasoning (dead flavor)
- Poppin' Dog: Waaaay to SALTY! If you like being thirsty all day.. go right ahead. I felt like I was chewing salt!

I'm sure this place can do A LOT better from greeting customers to holding back on salt!

thanx but no thanx!"}
{"text":"Just walked out of Sammy's. It wasn't busy. Three servers walked past me trying very hard not to make eye contact. The first server was ACTUALLY supposed to be my server. After an awkward 5-7 minutes he FINALLY spoke. What made it worse, no apology when I inquired if I had done something wrong. 

I fly in and out of McCarran a lot. Will never give them another chance and I'm spreading the word. 

Get some training in customer service please!

By the way the real rating is ZERO"}
{"text":"Popped in to a grab a drink and watch the Warriors/Rockets game. Before I could spit out a \"hi how are you\" to the bartender,he tells me they won't be playing the Warriors game (I'm wearing a jersey). He begins to tell me a bs policy about restaurants in the airport not be able to play the warriors game when the Vegas golden knights are playing at the same time. You have 4 TVs and they all gotta be on the same channel?

Walk two gates up and found an even busier, more open minded restaurant to play the game for us. 

TAKE CARE OF YOUR GUESTS NOT YOUR PERSONAL INTERESTS AND OPINIONS."}
{"text":"I gotta say that we had another good breakfast experience here.  The Los Cabos Bacon & Cheese Omelette is killer!  There's bacon and queso sauce, breakfast potatoes, queso fresco, chipotle crema, and crispy onion with toast.  It is rich and full of flavor.  A great last hurrah if you're leaving Vegas!

Husband had an ordinary Plain Jane with scrambled eggs and was fine with it.

GET the omelet!

However, skip the iced tea.  It was not good.  So not good I couldn't drink it, but they kindly took it off our bill."}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food here as my husband and I only sat down for drinks while we waited for our flight to board. The prices were alright, the beer selection wasn't too bad, and the waitress was fine. It's about what you'd expect for an airport bar. Not bad but not great either."}
{"text":"If one must surmise, staff surliness may be due to how they're treated by management. But dish out an extra ounce of kindness to your server and you just might be treated right. These guys/gals seem overworked."}
