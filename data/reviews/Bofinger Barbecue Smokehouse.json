{"text":"What was once our go place for ribs has turn to our never go to place. Barely any meat on the bones and the prices keep going up.. it's insane! Save your money go & somewhere else.. staff is super nice though."}
{"text":"Decent place to take the kids, who inexplicably love the mac and cheese. We probably go a couple of times a month. The food is variable, but generally good, and the service is usually fast and friendly. Lately they have been slowly raising prices and/or removing some of the extras."}
{"text":"Some of the best ribs in town. Kind of an awkward set up because you have to order yourself at the counter kind of like a fast food chain. Very good sauces to choose from for every kind of different taste. They also deliver which is a big + in my book.   Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Food is authentic southern BBQ. Lots of food for the money too."}
{"text":"Wow what a pale facsimile of the real thing. The meat is dried out and dull  the portions aren't that big, the service is mediocre/indifferent. We used to go once or twice a year (however long it took for us to forget how disappointed we were the previous time) before we finally gave up. Now there's Prime BBQ up on somerled, which is waaaay better."}
{"text":"The horror, the horror. Apocalypse now on all fronts: service, food, price, atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really used to enjoy this place. I would frequently order from it, come here after hockey games and enjoy a good beer with the boys while I slobbered over a nice pulled pork sandwich. I arrived tonight at 7:45. There was one other group in the whole entire restaurant, 2 people and they were clearly done with their meals. The four of us stepped up to the cash to be greeted by a very nice and cheery employee named Grace. Grave was welcoming and took our orders with speed and quality that could not be matched at any other restaurant of the same type of excellence. After placing our orders we sat down and watched tv while discussing what 4 guys discuss while waiting for our greasy food. 30 minutes and constant refills on our drinks and our food is no where to be seen. We are still the only other group and it seems that grace has left the building. Another 20 minutes pass and our food seems to have found its way to the counter. We wait with watering mouths as we watch the extremely rude and obnoxious Asian employee talk on the phone while our food sits growing colder and colder. I approach her and dumbly ask if our food is perhaps ready. She turns and is shocked to see it sitting waiting. Around 10 minutes later and 4 trips back and forth, the four of us finally have or food. It is cold, incorrectly spiced, missing many condiments and given with attitude. We try to enjoy our meal but find that the food does not compare to past visits. We leave with stomach aches and unhappy mindsets. Good luck next one bofinger, but know this has been my last visit."}
{"text":"Overpriced, average service, cold environment but the food was generally good but nothing outstanding for the price."}
{"text":"If you go in person, they are kind and it is a relaxed atmosphere. We have enjoyed meals there. They do forget your side order request though.  Their delivery, on the other hand, sucks! Multiple occasions we have ordered to be told 45 mins. 1.5 hrs later - where is our food???? When the poutines arrive - missing bacon! No bacon in the pulled pork and bacon poutines!!! And our bill definitely shows we paid it! We'd call to complain if we weren't so hungry when we finally got our food. We have stopped ordering delivery after this happened 4 times."}
{"text":"Imitation BBQ for a city that doesn't know better.  their pulled pork is so dry, maybe it's made a few days before or very far off site, they are pretty cheap on the sauce and the fries are certainly nothing to write home about.  If you know SW BBQ and are jonesing it may have to do though."}
{"text":"Been on a quest for some good ol' BBQ...  Found this spot a while ago(NDG). I 1st tried it about 2 years ago and it was quite good no lie. I had the chicken sandwich. As for the side I believed I had the mac n cheese n a salad. Went back a few times for some ribs and pulled pork.  On my most recent visit SUNDAY APRIL 20th ,2014 I finally tried a burger! Bo-lucious Burger. Now that was a sloppy good mess! Smoked patty,pulled pork, bacon,cheese... I had chosen the mac an cheese and an order of sweet potato fries. The burger was quite tasty, but the meat wasn't cooked to my liking. I like my meat well done,and unfortunately it was pink. The side portions were small ( I grew up in America) sides are usually enormous back in BBQ joints in LA! The mac and cheese needs improvements it was watery and flavorless. Sweet potato fries were well sweet potato fries, can't really mess that up! My friend had the combo meal of chicken and rib and a side of poutine. Oh and the gravy on that Poutine was AMAZBALLS! I tasted his food and it was Yummy to the 5th power!!!! He didn't really want to share!   The total for the combo meal(chicken &rib), changed the side to a poutine,1 fountain drink, bo-lucious burger, and aside of sweet potatoe fries= 45.00$ I thought it was a bit expensive, but since the food was good in overall we didn't really fuss about it.  The service was fast, and the lady who took our orders  was a sweetheart. I recommend this place for the meat and the poutine! The side orders aren't all of that.  Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Oh I've tried to give Bofinger NDG a chance, but after 10+ visits, with literally one successful one, I'm giving up on this place!  I have had decent ribs here in the past - mainly when eating in.  But EVERY time I've ordered take-out, there is a problem.   From my experience I've seen that they are highly  inconsistent with food quality and quantity and they forget to give you items you've ordered/paid for.  My last visit was the worst yet. I arrived at 11:10am to pick up lunch for myself and my co-workers, and only one staff member had arrived so far (they opened at 11am).  I waited, submitted my order, waited again, and I was on my way 35 minutes later.  When I got back to my office, and opened the boxes of food, we were all disappointed to see fries that were merely blanched and not cooked through, ribs that were cold in the middle, AND with the wrong sauce, and two side dishes missing. My co worker also ordered a red velvet cupcake, which was totally gross - it seemed it had been sitting for over a week - it was rock hard.   Sorry Bofinger, but you've lost my business."}
{"text":"Food is super good, service is slow and not that great, a lot of time they mix the order, forget thingd or dont remimber what you order, even two times alredy i asked for take out, and they brought to me in plates, but overall will recommand that spot!!!"}
{"text":"Found a metal shard in my fries. I brought them up to the girl at the counter and showed it to her. She said \"oh my, that's terrible\", honestly surprised at it. She then took my fries away and ignored me. Won't be going back. Complete lack of respect for public health."}
{"text":"Ever seen an airplane nose diving to the earth? It's a reasonable analogy of the last Bofinger and earth is bankruptcy.  The whole place smells like pee, tables are sticky, and I mean STICKY!! I think maybe they used bbq sauce as cleaning supplies. It's unfortunate because there is  no barbeque places anywhere in Montreal, It's like a BBQ vacuum. Monterealers seem to consider rotisserie? chicken as BBQ.  There are a few places that attempt southern or Texas BBQ here like Diablos or Rubs, but Bofinger USED to be the only place that sort of came close. Generous portions, sauce up to your elbows and a unbuttoned pair of jeans as your Homer Simpson gut spills out everywhere while you moan.  I keep returning and over the last few years hoping for the good ol days and I have watched the chain of restaurants shrink to one, and whoever is running the last one has completely checked out. There is no passion for barbequed food  it is just a paycheck and a return on investment. The place has become so over the top sticky, dirty and smelly that I have SERIOUS reservations about the cleanliness of the kitchen. The food has gotten so bad it's absolutely inedible, store bought generic coleslaw, stale bread, unseasoned meat. The portions are so small they don't make any sense from someone calling themselves a BBQ joint.   I normally post photos of food, but I am posting photos of the armor we made for our sticky table. We switched from 3 tables till we found this one that was least sticky. Our beverage glasses actually stuck to the tables. This isn't something that happens from a spilled pop, this is weeks of build up.   Funny side note, the counter guy was super friendly and nice and was good at his job, but when I asked about the pulled pork.... \"I don't know? I don't eat pork\" pretty funny, a non meat eater in a meat only restaurant."}
{"text":"Being the stereotypical american I was feining for some BBQ food. Probably other BBQ shops in the city, but for some reason every time I stay out in MontreaI go here. Could be the location since its usually so close to the hotel that we generally stay at. The beef ribs are pretty good and they give a variety of sauces to brush on the ribs. The mac and cheese is a pretty good side to shoot for also. The menu is a little pricey and the beers are too, but the service is pretty good and the food comes out pretty quick.  My review probably a little bias since I'm from the \"states\" , but in all its average to good."}
{"text":"The food is ok, the service is always a little sketchy. We were there yesterday for lunch, which was probably our 20th visit there. A very, very confused man from the back tried very hard to figure out how to turn on the lights (they never got turned on the entire time that we were there), how to work the cash, what the lunch specials were (although they were out in front on a board AND on paper on the counter), How to work the beer taps, how to make change (he called someone over to help him)......my husband asked him if he wanted for us to wait until a staff member came in.    He was very nice but blatantly not front of house staff.       Never got my coleslaw that went with the meal - I'm not sure why but it seemed that he couldn't open up the salad section.      The food......lunch specials (Mon-Thurs) are priced very well, but it's the only time to go get a sandwich there because their prices are very high. When it opened it was a fun place to hit on Sherbrooke Street and we still go back every month or so but we know what's ahead of us - order ribs and you'll never get the same order twice (they are NEVER the same size and are mostly bone), order chicken and it's pink or red at the bone so you can't finish it, order a sandwich and you'll hate yourself for what you spent for a mushroom sandwich (no meat but the same price as a pulled pork sandwich).  The inside is charming and very attractive but you'll wonder why there's no table service, just a young hipster girl with a tank top, a scarf and tattoos at the cash with a tip jar.  We dig the location, love that you can grab a beer and drink it on the patio while you wait for your meal and although the food generally tastes pretty good, there's a lot of room for improvement."}
{"text":"Excellent southern barbecue restaurant for ribs, chicken. Best place for this style in town."}
{"text":"No good.  Sloppy pulled pork sandwich with vegetables and crap stuffed in the bun. Choking on pickles and banana peppers.  Montreal has so much good food. Don't waste your time and energy here.  Fries were ok though, so 2 stars for that..."}
{"text":"I just ordered a rib combo for take out. When I got home I found two large pieces of BONES with lots of fries and a piece of bread. But there was absolutely no meat on the ribs. I paid about $14.00 with taxes and all I can think is that I was robbed. I cannot believe this. How do they get away with it? I live in the neighborhood and often times order take out. The first few times the food was excellent but of late I am always left with a very bitter taste in my mouth ... This is defintely the last time that I will give them my money.  sorry guys but you have totally blown it."}
{"text":"Let me just say, I was so eager to find good food in Montreal. I had long long long detailed lists of different restaurants to try, and about 80% of them were barely decent.  Soooo...one day, walking around the neighborhood where Complexe Les Ailes is located, I ended up bumping into this place. It was one of the ones recommended but I didn't go out of my way to visit.  OH, this is that BBQ PLACE!   Walking in the day we went was probably a slow day, because no one was in there, at all. It was a Saturday. Around noon. Hey now, I wasn't complaining, no lines and crowds = perfect. Just a little curious why it was completely empty.  The location is great, but the parking in Montreal is completely brutal overall.  Inside Bofinger: high ceilings, open & spacious, fun seating, and you know what, its kind of like sitting in a big BBQ Grill or something. I don't know. Know what I mean though??  The employees were really helpful and nice. Quite attentive, probably because no one else was there. They didn't even scrutinize me for not eating meat, and only ordering the BBQ Portabello without pork. Oh, and we also ordered mac n' cheese, baked beans and fries (but definitely not poutine.)   The portions were okay, the Portabello was quite a mess, but that's what napkins are for. The side portions were small, I'm American, so I can say that. The sauces were good, but not the best.  I heard the pulled pork wasn't as good as other places, but I can't personally comment. All I can remember clearly was that I was stuffed, and had a lot of leftovers.   More people started to show up as we were leaving, so it wasn't deserted the whole time.  I'm sure I'll find myself in Montreal in the future, and maybe I'll be eating meat by then.  Not a place I'd fly out to visit, but if I'm in the area, sure.  Good for  big  groups!"}
{"text":"Upon entering the restaurant, the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming.  Being the first time I ate at the restaurant, I asked to have whatever the owner was proud about and told him that all I wanted to have was a reason to return for seconds.  They delivered a plate of pork ribs, chicken breast, chicken wings, beef rib, Mac and cheese, cole slaw, fries and a piece of bread. He gave me strict instructions not to bite my fingers off while eating. I obliged. Food was fantastic and needless to say... I will be returning. Thank you to the staff at bofinger for making this a memorable experience."}
{"text":"When Bofinger's first opened in '06 me thinks, the food was off the charts. Lineups out the door, people singing its praises, it was a great place to go for somewhat-authentic-bbq.  Apparently the owner made a million in his first year. How did he repay us? by determining that we were idiots that would keep going even if he went from selling us fresh out of the smoker bbq to refrigerated lower quality ribs that he ships in from his industrial kitchen in TMR.  These days I'll go 2 or 3 times a year, usually when I have forgotten the mediocre experience of my last visit.  Terribly over rated, but now its attendance is matched to its quality (i.e. not at all).  I wish I could recommend somewhere else, but Montreal is a haven for mediocre food at good food prices."}
{"text":"I guess this place is good value because you receive a ton of really terrible food with terrible service at a cheap price.  The food is always cold, the sides are terrible (except for the coleslaw), and the service is terrible - whenever I have gone it is like a bunch of high schoolers are running the place.  Last time I went half the tables weren't cleared,  there was no cutlery to eat with and I had to ask for it 6 times and wait 5 minutes to get anything, and after I did I had a door slammed in my face.   A friend of mine said it was worse that a school cafeteria - I would have to agree."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Dry, unseasoned, bad portioning. Would not recommend. Have only ordered from the ndg location."}
{"text":"I like this place. This time we went there and sat on the benches outside and ate/drank. I had a pulled pork combo this time, with a pitcher of beer. Lovely vibe and food.  The food is not \"exceptional\" but it is very tasty, and delivers on hitting the spot. Plus the seating is cool for great weather in the NDG area and beer outside is always a plus."}
{"text":"I stoped going there 'cause it's going to kill me! Still 5 stars!   I LOVE this place. Some excellent ribs. the cheapest i've found and REALLY NATURALLY SMOKED! No fake stuff here. The sauces are awesome and I've been to the one downtown near University and Ste-Catherine and it's the best and biggest poutine i've eaten. Cheap as well! 4,99$ for a Poutine with real homemade sauce (no bullcrap can sauce that is so acid it'll kill you when you'll burp). I've eaten pretty much all the menu, no deception nowhere. I've also been on the one in the WestIsland on Des Sources (Galerie Des Sources). It's not the best but still pretty simular. Beer is also pretty cheap and you are really comfortably seaten on the typical Leather bunks. with a flat screen tv showing Sports and some Rock N Roll music playing on the Background. (I recon some Sun Record Compilation of Rock N Roll /  Blues)  Staff is super friendly. They like their client and Downtown they are passionate about what they do."}
{"text":"This place is hilarious... they're out of onion rings, out of fried pickles, out of red wine, out of cherry soda AND OUT OF ICE! Holy shit, this place is so poorly organized a baby kangaroo could manage it better. And if FRIENDS has taught me anything it's that joeys are notoriously unorganized."}
{"text":"I had been here before and while I wasn't blown away by the food , I remember it being decent but I was sooooo disappointed with my latest experience to the point that it was enough to be my last. Really not worth it. The ribs were beyond dry , the fries were totally unsalted, the mac and cheese tasted like unsalted Kraft dinner and the philly cheese steak sandwich had good flavour in the sauce but barely had any brisket inside at all. It was mostly onions and mushrooms buried in BBQ sauce and somehow even the little bit of brisket inside was also insanely dry. While they have a great location with nice indoor and outdoor seating, that's all I have to say as positives right now. While I had better....but not great experiences here previously , based on the last one -Unfortunately I really wouldn't recommend this place anymore and won't be going back."}
{"text":"My experience just last night leaves me very surprised about the low ratings for this resto... Hubby & I ordered delivery from Bofinger last night and we were *very* satisfied! For the affordable price and the quality + tastiness, we will definitely order from there again.   I ordered the BBQ Chicken sandwich with Mac n' Cheese as the side, and Jason (ma hubby) ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich with Fries n' Coleslaw. **Really awesome stuff here!!!** The toppings were quite impressive having a wide variety (green olives, tomato, lettuce, melted cheese, red onion, hot peppers, pickle, red pepper, green pepper, and maybe more I'm just forgetting). Being able to choose your sauce for the sandwich is fun too. I picked the BBQ n' Honey, which wasn't too BBQ-y, but that's okay. The Mac n' Cheese side was good too. Very pleased overall!   I have to disagree with the comment from Tara on August 13th 2011 about the BBQ Chicken sandwich (sorry, Tara!!). The BBQ Chicken sandwich won't burn your mouth off with hot BBQ, this is true, but the sandwich is very very delicious and totally worth the price of $9.99. Additionally, Jason said the Pulled Pork sandwich was awesome too - it didn't taste like just the sauce.   Delivery was quick enough and our order was correct which we appreciated.   Return Worthy? YES Bofinger is affordable with good tasting food and proper service*  (*for delivery, we have not been to the resto in person).   Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"Don't bring your vegetarian friends here! They'll be insulted!  Seriously, this has to be carnivore heaven! The beef ribs here look like something Fred Flintstone would munch on - they're HUGE! Not a lot of meat, lots of bone, lots of sticky and dirty fingers afterwards hence the rolls of paper towels at each table.   With pulled pork sandwiches, BBQ chicken, sausage, burgers, pork ribs, beef ribs, chilli, fries, mac'n cheese, you can stuff yourself silly here.   I lived in the States for a while and while it doesn't even come close to the BBQ smokepits of our neighbors to the south, where they've pretty much perfected it to an art form in places like Tennessee, Texas, Kansas etc. Bofinger will get you buy if you need a fix."}
{"text":"Ive been a few times. I enjoyed it. Sauces were really good. Just a little cheap with the sauces. Sauces should be included and have a bottle at the table i know cus ive been at Texas and in FLA for BBQ and always have bottle sauces at the tables...  Not always consistant tue food but mainly good fun to eat a bit pricy for that type of food.... but ill give it a try here and there and usually enjoy it! Moosehead on the tap amazing with the bbq smoked food."}
{"text":"It was ok , i like mi chili con carne , very tasty, good service , close at 11pm , benches , tv screen to follow hockey.."}
