{"text":"Fantastic!!!  We travel all the way from Scottsdale to eat here . Best  Italian restaurant  ever . Love the owner , love the staff great  atmosphere  and very  cozy . You must take the ride it is  definitely worth it  !!!"}
{"text":"We loved this local eatery as Il Posto, and it changed ownership 6 to 12 months ago...?  There have been some growing pains, but tonight we had excellent meals, and a new server, Yvonne. It is probably 105f outside, but we are the weirdos that would still rather eat on the patio. When I served, I would have rolled my eyes and been short as hell with the ONLY customers on the patio, but she was gracious, outgoing and friendly the entire visit! We never were looking for her, she was proactively there, even with no other tables on the patio to tend to. Great new menu items + fantastic new server = we will be back again!"}
{"text":"Been going to this restaurant for over 15 years - great food, great service...the lasagna, angel hair pasta with shrimp and baked torts are the best as is the bread and pesto served with every meal.    Would recommend this place to all!!!!!"}
{"text":"This has been a long time favorite of ours, but this evenings meal just wasn't the quality we've come to expect, no pesto for the bread or pizzas, my NY White pizza was undercooked and the patrons were few and far between.  I asked for light cheese and extra garlic, both requests were ignored.  And the $50.00 check for two small pizzas and 2 draft beers is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Best linguini and red clam sauce this side of the mississippi"}
{"text":"i just spent $30 on four tiny stuffed mushrooms and the most tasteless excuse for spaghetti that i've ever eaten. i am beyond dissatisfied and angry that i wasted my money like this. please do not eat the pasta from here it's a waste of your money"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there on 10/26/10 to eat. We have been going here about every other month for years (back when it used to be Our Gang Cafe and now is Il Posto) and have always enjoyed the food and the service up until tonight. We have even brought others with us on occasion. I had originally called to make sure they were open and the person that answered the phone just said \"hi\". She did not identify the place so I had to ask is this \"Il Posto\" and got silence. I asked again and she said yes and gave me their hours of operation. Then when we got there we asked to be seated at a booth inside. (Did not want to take the chance that there were smokers on the patio.) The first booth was right behind the hostess station and on the other side was a prep station with plates and misc items that looked like the busboys used to set up the tables. The noise from the clanking of items was too loud so I asked for another booth. The next booth we sat down at the table was dirty although there were fresh settings. So we got up and went to a third booth. There were several large crumbs of food items on the seats and the table had a greasy sheen to it. There was a busboy (waiter?) nearby so we asked if he could clean the table again. He came to the table and took the seat cushion and upended it and flipped it over and slammed it down loudly and gave us a look like we were bothering him. We also told him the table was greasy, so he grabbed a cloth in a huffy way and pushed the cloth around on one small spot in a circle near the end of the table and then threw the cloth on his station. So I went over to the hostess and started telling her what had happened and then stopped and asked for the manager. I was told the manager was busy. I told her I couldn't believe the awful treatment we were getting. A gentlemen with a long apron came up and tried to help us but all he really did was give us lip service. His attitude was not one of someone who cared if a customer had a good experience. He pointed out a table instead of a booth and we pointed out to him that the table also had a greasy sheen to it so he ran his hand over it and saw that his fingers left a trail on the table like ours did on the other tables. We just decided to leave because it seemed that no one there cared about us having a quiet and enjoyable meal. This just is not acceptable and I'm sad to say I will most likely never eat here again and I will tell everyone I know about how badly we were treated."}
{"text":"We ordered the calamari appetizer and the field greens salad. The calamari was ok and it was nice to have two different dipping sauces. The field greens salad was good. I ordered the gnocci and my fiance ordered the linguini in clam sauce. The gnocci was ok, it was very buttery. The linguini pasta was cooked well but the sauce was gross. Like cat food gross. It did not look or taste homemade at all. Very disappointing and as you can tell by the picture there was a lot left. This is odd because my fiance is a garbage disposal. Everyone who knows him knows this, but he did not finish this plate.   The worst? I woke up at midnight very nauseous and threw up.   Thanks Il Posto."}
{"text":"I have to say this is the very first time in my life that I have ever been so disappointed in a restaurant. First of all my family and I got there half and hour early by mistake, which was our fault but instead of just letting us sit down and look at the menu and grab us waters or something they sent us over next door to The Lounge. The Lounge was very nice but we felt bad going in there and not buying a drink so we ended up spending extra money there. The hostess also said she would come get us when they were ready and she never did. When we went in there was already another table seated... Remember throughout this that this restaurant is labeled \"INEXPENSIVE\"  The waitress was really nice but she didn't really seem to know much. Maybe she was new. Anyways,we ordered the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer. It was $7 and there were only 4 small mushrooms and they were BATHED in cheese sauce. It was not very good...and I love stuffed mushrooms. When the waitress asked how we liked it I was politely honest and let her know that it was just \"ok.\"   For our entrees we ordered a kids pasta with marinara ($4, didn't include anything else) and I have never seen such light marinara at an Italian restaurant! The sauce was definitely not made there, tasted like a grocery store brand sauce. My husband got the chicken marsala ($13) - the chicken and sauce were adequate, but we have no doubts in our mind that they used instant mashed potatoes. I ordered the clam linguini ($14) which came with a choice of red or white sauce. Now, when you have a choice between red or white don't you think of a creamy white sauce? Well, that was not the case. The dish came out and the sauce was light yellow and clearish; kind of like a butter sauce. I'm going to blame it on my pregnancy but I was really looking forward to the creamy white sauce. So, I told the waitress what I thought the menu meant and that I would like a bowl of creamy white sauce to put on it instead. No problem right....but oh wait, they charged me two dollars for a few ounces of alfredo sauce! Are you kidding me!? From the look of all the other cheap ingredients I'm sure it was cheap sauce, from a huge jar that they probably paid 5 bucks for. What happened to satisfying your customer? Especially after we did not enjoy our appetizer...  Il Posto is mislabeled and should have 2 $ signs instead.  I think when yelp said \"inexpensive\" they actually meant \"cheap.\" They charged way too much for their cheap ingredients and not so great customer service.  Needless to say we will not be going back..."}
{"text":"Amazing....a little gem in the back of an unassuming strip mall... thank god for yelp. Baked ziti with sausage is so great....so is chicken parm. We were just around the corner but worth the drive from wherever you are. Ziggy has such passion .... love it .. the outside patio is very nice...service was great...got desert to go because portions were so big"}
{"text":"This place has sadly gone downhill since it was Our Gang cafe. The patio is still a nice place to dine and our waitress was very attentive and sweet, but the dishes we ordered were bleah. Its a bummer because they were things we had eaten here before and were favorites.   We had the calamari appetizer and it was a smaller portion, better for 1 person, served on a too big mound of romaine. Was too rubbery.  My wife had the chicken parmigiana and they put waaay too much sauce on it. The breading was ruined by that and just sloughed off. The sauce was bland.  I had the mussells marinara with an ok caesar salad. The marinara was a very tasty wine sauce. I ate about 8 mussells then bit into a bad one. Had to spit it out since it was rancid. Was on a date night with my wife with the kids at home which is rare, so i decided to try and power through it without sending it back and wrecking the flow. I ate 2 more mussells and then hit another bomb. I had to tap out and call it a wrap at that point.  Hopefully they get new cooks back there or new kitchen management, or the existing ones  can get their sh*t together."}
{"text":"I first tried out this place with my boyfriend, and shared a pizza and salad. Our waitress was super sweet, and the food was pretty good. Having this experience, I decided I would have a group dinner here, to celebrate my friend's birthday. 20 people confirmed, so I decided to call to make a reservation. Not only was I given the run around as to whether they actually accepted reservations, but the hostess on the phone was extremely snotty. I ended up having to call the place 3 times, to ensure my tables would be held. We were assigned one waitress to our table, who acted annoyed the entire time. Our entire party was drinking too, so I was not sure why the attitude. Don't servers want their tables  to rack up a bill?? Aside from the service, everything else was great. I just wish our business had been appreciated more. Maybe next time we will stick to a restaurant chain who knows how to handle large parties, and appreciate people who spend money with them."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant and lounge in the Valley! Cindy is the heart of this family run business for sure but you'll find out quickly that both heart and talent runs in the family.  Ziggy is an artist in the kitchen and Chris, when he's not running the lounge is also an awesome chef and can be found at least once a week whipping up those fabulous Italian dishes that I love!  They have a fantastic patio, inside seating in the restaurant and a lounge where you can also order their full menu.  They continually bring in fun local talent and are definitely becoming a neighborhood hotspot as well as the Italian restaurant of choice for travelers.  In addition to fantastic food, you won't find a place with a friendlier staff or better service anywhere.  I love, love, love Ziggy's and in fact, writing this review is making me crave Italian - I think I'll head over there tonight!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Best place for Italian in Phoenix ! Pasta,pizza , wine you name it - the best ! Outdoor bar spot great date side spot - head next door \"The Lounge\" for comedy night or music - you won't be disappointed and would inevitably impress your date-other half! Your welcome leave a shot fireball chip and I'll return the favor ! See you there! Enjoy"}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice Italian Restaurant close to home. I googled and read the reviews then I realized this was right down the road. The atmosphere was awesome! Patio seating so romantic. The the food came and what a taste for the senses. The food and the service was great. We loved it so much that we ordered pizza and wings to go the very next night. This is a gem of a restaurant we loved it!!!!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 630 pm. Very few people there. At 7 pm finally received drinks. At 830 finally received meals. Waitress was rude to one of our guests. She was also bartender so it took her time away as a waitress. Food that one guest ordered was poorly prepared. Tasted like rubber. My chicken was below tasty too. For $17 bucks you should get some form of a potato with it. Not worth the money. Olive Garden is better."}
{"text":"Found this place on restaurant.com. You can get a $25 gift card for $10 bucks!   My hubby and I really enjoyed ourselves. It does not look like much from the outside but the patio is so cute!!! You really feel like you have a little piece of New York in Phoenix.    We got the bruchetta which was very good. My husband got a seafood special which was loaded with all different kinds of shellfish. I had the pizza and while it was good, I would suggest getting a pasta dish. All of the pastas looked amazing and the pizza looked reminiscent of a frozen pizza."}
{"text":"Cheese ravioli is pretty weak.  Tomato sauce had no flavor.  Service was decent.  The eggplant parm tasted like Egg Foo Young, which was weird and gross.  Pizza was pretty good."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to this place since it was Our Gang Cafe. They have fairly average, but always tasty food, and the service has always been great. We love the patio for a nice relaxing evening.   The one negative is their very non-Italian desert menu. What Italian place doesn't serve canolis?  They also don't serve cappuccino or espresso so plan on going elsewhere for desert.    The lounge next door is apparently under the same ownership, and is a great place to enjoy a glass of wine and some anti pasta before dinner."}
{"text":"This is a good place for just drinks in The Lounge or dinner on other side of restaurant which is I'l Posto. Nice outdoor area with another bar also. Owner is great and portions along with service are typically good.  Go here pretty often, comedy and music nights have quite a few people and always a fun time."}
{"text":"I was trying to figure out why there are such different reviews for this place.  I was thinking that the bad reviews were from people who were used to corporate chains and processed foods.  I really got that wrong. If you are expecting Italy or Naples style food, you too will be greatly let down as I was.  I had several texts to warn me when I checked in here for dinner.  I should have listened. Pasta was overcooked.  Floating in a butter sauce, literally.  So much poor quality cheese on everything.  Pizza was like frozen style maybe before it was frozen.  Smothered in greasy cheese on a boring crust. We had 2 dinners and 2 pizzas.  We ate about 1/3 and felt sick from the heavy, cheesy, oily, buttery and greasy food.  I may have to have a cholesterol medication after this.  Even my dinner salad had about a cup of cheese pellets on top of it.  I've not seen mozzarella in this form before.  What is going on here?  Maybe I would have thought this was good when I was in my teens.  I think that this place has a lot going for it, but not it's food."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and service was quick. The decor is beautiful, I loved the court yard.  The pasta I had was good but nothing to special. But I will be back to try something new."}
{"text":"Will NEVER dine here again.  Have dined here several times since they renovated but it's never bee as good as the original.  Now it's hit an all time low.  We dined there the other night.  One of us had the pizza which was ok though rather greasy.  Two of us had entrees which were awful.  Both were drowning in sauce and very unappetizing.  We ate on the patio which is the restaurant's best feature.  However, there were tons of flies ruining any semblance of ambiance.  Never again."}
{"text":"Il Posto is very close to my house, so I'd been jonesing to try it again. I had been here years ago when it was known as Our Gang, and I was as impressed with the actual restaurant now as I was then: it is big, but has lots of nooks and crannies and a cool outdoor area with a fire pit and outdoor bar, it's pretty nifty for Phoenix. They've made it feel very Scottsdale with the new decor inside. I can take that or leave it. The food is what matters, and the food was good, but not great. I can't remember how good it was back in the Our Gang days, that was like nine years ago, but the food now is hit and miss. It is definitely more hit than miss.   The meal starts with a complimentary basket of bread with a garlic/parmesan/pesto dipping sauce that is just plain FABULOUS. We had the crab cakes appetizer. The flavor was absolutely delicious and the remoulade it came with was decadent, but the cakes were ruined by being ridiculously mushy. I had the seafood manicotti (see my uploaded picture) which we both agreed was blameless and wonderful. My wife had the veal parmesan which we both found bland and somewhat overcooked, with too much breading. It came with an abundance of pasta on the side, soaked in a sauce that was a lot like thickened tomato soup. I like tomato soup, she doesn't. It was pretty unforgivably mediocre.   All in all, we didn't feel like our experience was worth sixty bucks, but we think we might feel different if we came back and ordered more judiciously."}
{"text":"Very pleasant place. Was with a party of 12 and we were kinda rowdy but received impeccable service. Reasonable prices for reasonable wines. Delicious salads and a wonderful ambiance. A bit spendy food-wise for what is just slightly above average italian."}
{"text":"It 's more like two 1/2 stars.... Very cute place but the food, like many Italian restaurants in phoenix, was pretty disappointing.  I was there with a group of 12 for a birthday party. We pretty much ordered off the pasta menu. I ordered the baked tortellini with a white and red cream sauce, it was missing any king of flavor, one of my friend ordered spaghetti carbonara, although it was not made in a traditional way and although the pasta was way over cooked , it had a pretty good flavor.  Like i said the place has a little charm but with very pricey food, 15 average for entree' , and very little flavor  it deserves just two 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere..  I had the Ricotta Bolognese and Melanie had the Gnocchi in a gorgonzola sauce, both fantastic.  Can't wait to go back and try other dishes.  Melanie has dined in Italy eating Gnocchi and she said Ziggy's was the best she's ever had.  We highly recommend Ziggy's.  Great to have them in the Neighborhood."}
{"text":"You go to a restaurant for a few reasons,: great food that you cant quite duplicate in your own kitchen , enjoyable atmosphere and a nice drink..at least that's why me and my friends go out. Il posto delivers when it comes to these key elements. I find it interesting reading some other reviews on here because the service has never been an issue for me (and ive been quite a bit). sure its not always the absolute best every time, but having working in restaurants a large chunk of my life just because servers aren't running around doesn't mean they aren't working hard or caring. Beside the point anyway, for me. The food is fantastic, especially their seafood dishes and the PIZZA,  love the thai pizza. Atmosphere i great, cute patio area with a bar, not to hot later in the evening. They have specialty cocktails that are all great and  unique. Servers are generally knowledgeable about wine (after all it is an italian place) anytime they may not have the answer the bartender is never too far away with a recommendation. For the price this is truly one of my favorite spots for dinning out,"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and amazing food. I've been hearing about this place for years and finally decided to try it. I will becoming back again very soon!  Overall A+ experience!!!"}
{"text":"Under new ownership since Spring. Had cocktails at the next door and co-owned, The Lounge and then Il Posto just after the ownership change and then again tonight and the \"switching-it-up\" was immediately apparent. Creative house salad, great entree, awesome wine and great sassy service. The owner is very personal and present and very happy to talk to you about the business. The Lounge has been transformed into a hip \"must go venue\" with acts Tuesday through Saturdays from Standup Comedy, live guitar and jazz. So great to have this in \"the slope.\" Businesses like this are going to drive up this neighborhood. Well done Ziggy ... and thank you."}
{"text":"We love Ziggys atmosphere and the food is fantastic. We were greeted immediately and seated quickly.  For real home made Italian food you must try it.  My husband never finishes an entrée and yet tonight he had Spaghetti and sausage and kept commenting on how wonderful his meal was and it was the best he had ever had. I was shocked, he ate the whole meal.  We have been there before and have brought the kids and grandkids.  Don't miss this treasure.  Great food, fairly priced and you won't be disappointed in the quality."}
{"text":"Great gorgonzola baked ziti!! Yum!! Good food. Good wine. Good time!. Good service. Attentive Ziggie!"}
{"text":"What a delightful evening.  It was a bit chilly, but the fire pit and heat lamps worked.  The staff was excellent and so wanting to please.  The salmon on spinach was so yummy.  The red sauce had fabulous flavor.  I asked for my fish to be done rare, and rare it was.  So delicious!! Many restaurants will not make fish rare for me.  This was perfect and a very generous amount.  I will return!!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised. It doesn't look like much from the road (7th street), but as yo walk up you can see the sparkly outdoor patio, which by the way was full of Happy people. The food was wonderful just like the service. Portions were just right... We\"ll be back!"}
{"text":"This place gets one star for decor. We were excited about trying this place but after being seated and getting water, we were IGNORED for a total of 15 min. They were not busy and the two waitresses walked by our table multiple times. I called after leaving to speak to a manager and was told the manager was not available. Things we did to try to get service....put our menus down, smiled at the waitress, watched them walk by. The waitresses even chatted for a bit at their station. WTF? Not a family friendly place like they advertise. We did not demand service...were just hoping to get good service, which apparently was lacking."}
{"text":"This place is just OK.    I'm not sure why everyone, despite whether they like this place or not, seems to think the bread and pesto/olive oil dipping sauce is so spectacular.  Its didn't strike me as that great.  Though I've had homemade pesto (yum) so I'm a bit spoiled I guess.  Our server was great.  She was very friendly, energetic and attentive.    The portions here are small.  I ordered the ravioli.  For the price I would expect more than 6 small ravioli.  Had they been larger, homemade and absolutely delicious I'd feel differently.  But these were your run of the mill, frozen grocery store ravioli.  And I was hungry when I was finished - wishing there were a few more ravioli on the plate.  The hubs had the manicotti, which was slightly better than the ravioli but also a small portion.    The highlight of the meal was dessert.  I had the chocolate tartufo (chocolate ice cream with nuts, chocolate chips and whipped cream) which was delicious.  The hubs ordered the creme brulee which came topped with fruit.  Different but very tasty."}
{"text":"I can now say I've been to Il Posto for lunch, dinner, and happy hour.  I love their patio so much that I wouldn't even consider eating inside, even if it was 100 degrees outside.   I'm surprised more hasn't been mentioned about their delish homemade potato chips.  I've been known to skip the salad so that I could fill up on more chips. I'm usually like meat, but went with the margherita pizza last night and I can say I'm impressed.  The bread and pesto sauce were also excellent. With great atmosphere and good food, I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Posto still delivers as it did when it was called Our Gang a few years back (Our Gang is now the name of the sports Bar next door).  We were seated quickly on the Patio and promptly waited on.  Appetizers and drinks were quickly brought out. My wife ordered the gnocci and I had the Cavatappi.  Both were very good, leaving no room for desert. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Our family dined here last friday evening, this is about our 6th visit in the past couple of years. We live close by and so wish it was a great local go to eatery. Clearly whoever owns it has thought about the decor, the outdoor patio is very cool. On friday evening we had the large booth on the right as you walk in, my guess is no one has cleaned the table with anything other than a damp rag for months, i bought this to the attention of the server and guess what a quick wipe over witha wet rag. The table had so much grime on it when i passed my cc over it, it bought up a large film of who knows what, that really set us off in the wrong direction. I dont get why the simple things like tables being clean get overlooked. We have come to expect the food to be a bit hit and miss, the bread and olive oil with pesto is great. I ordered pasta it was ok not great but prices are very reasonable, we sent one of the salads back ...... Sadly i think we will not return, big shame its close to our home and someone clearly cared enough at some point to create a great environment but food quality and cleanliness are really wanting."}
{"text":"Love the patio area! We frequent there after work for dinner and a drink, favorite is the calamari appetizer and field greens salad. They have a great bartender in the patio named Jesse, always remembers what we need and makes it a relaxing evening! They also came out with a new drink menu thats worth the try!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this restaurant thoroughly.  The bread and pesto is delicious, I look forward to it every time I go there.  The last time I was there, I had a really good seafood pasta (I don't remember the name, it was one of their specials) and it was really good for the most part, the shrimp was a little overcooked though.  I have enjoyed every other pasta dish I have had there and the chicken dishes I have tried were very good too.  I need to try the pizza sometime, it looks good, I am just typically more of a pasta person.  As far as the place itself, the bathrooms are ok, and the restaurant itself is clean and pleasant.  I have never sat on the patio to eat, but I would really like to sometime, as it looks pretty cool."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on Weds night. It was ok. The service wsnt very good and the food could have been better. I had been here before and remembered it to be really good thats why I recommended it to the friends I was having dinner with. But was a little disappointed."}
{"text":"I went to a wedding reception at Ziggy's last night and was pleasantly surprised to find the quality of food to be above average. The genuine hospitality of the staff was a nice change for me since I live in The LA area most of the time. Seriously, I travel all over and it's hard to find this kind of place. We had the linguini and clams along with the tortellini and Alfredo sauce and both were amazing!! The spinach dip was so good I almost didn't save room for the dinner but glad I did!!! I'm half Italian and very picky when it comes to this type of  cuisine. If I lived in the area I would definitely be a regular customer. Hope to be revisit this restaurant and the owner soon!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Italian food I have had in Phoenix. I went there for a date with my boyfriend, he had the spaghetti and fried mozzarella (made in house fresh). I had the seafood manicotti (best I've ever had by far), stuffed mushroom caps and a caprese salad. First of all I want to kiss the genius who created the brandy cream sauce for the mushrooms. It was phenomenal. Second the seafood manicotti actually had a bunch of seafood in it which is rare and appreciated. The caprese salad was more than the basic tomato and cheese  with basil combo. They added roasted red peppers and artichokes and it was large enough to share. The friendly bartender Mel helped me choose a great wine that paired perfect with my meal . She also kept the man happy with great mixed drinks that didn't taste watered down like most bars. The atmosphere was beautiful . We sat on the patio and enjoyed the decorative lights and Italian themed building in the background. For a second it really took you out of Phoenix and made you feel like you were on vacation. The owner introduced herself and treated us like family. It is everything I miss in restaurants these days. The family operated , great food, great music, great decor and awesome overall environment. I Definitely have found our new Friday spot."}
{"text":"Great Sunday deal; to go for $30! Salad, 12' Pizza and pasta entree. Salad was Vegiterranean and it wasn't a side salad, it was a full on meal full of pitted black olive, artichokes and banana peppers. Mahrgarita pizza was really good w/ full slice of tomato and excellent crust and the pasta cavatappi was excellent. Add all that w/ a nice bar area and cool patio area and you've got a really cool place to have a few and good food too, particularly on Sunday to go!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service. We had the lasagne and the chicken marsala. Both were well proportioned, well presented and well cooked. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"The best place in town for real home made Italian food! Great atmosphere and excellent meals. Ziggy and his family have a real gem and it's always worth the wait.  There are 4 different seating areas that are each very unique, frequently they have live music in The Lounge, or enjoy the outdoor weather on one of the 2 patios. The best part of this place is truly the people. Be sure to check this spot out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Initial impression was good. Cute patio and overall atmosphere. It ended there. Even though it wasn't busy when we arrived the service was bad and got worse. Took nearly an hour to get our wine and salad. Actually had to ask the waitress. During this time the place became busier and the service was notably erratic. A tablet that came in after us received the appetizer we had ordered an hour ago.  I had to request our good be served. Then the food came and it was poor. The mussels were the smallest I had ever seen. Main dishes mostly melted cheese. The table next to us had to ask where their wine order was. It final came and a bug was in one of the glasses. Never going back. Save your money."}
{"text":"Decent food at reasonable prices. Had the chicken parmigiana and it was very good. Service was ok. Sat in the lounge and listened to some nice mellow tunes while we had dinner."}
{"text":"I found this place one Yelp... sometimes I don't trust Yelp, but this time around I wanted to try something new. I was so glad me and my husband came here! It was a little far for us, but definitely worth it. Our server was Amy, she was really sweet and nice. I had Gnocchi, the sauce was cheesy and it went well with the fresh bread that they give you. We also had our own individual water, it came in an old style type of bottle. We sat in the patio outside, the decoration and vibe outside made me forget I was in good ol' Arizona..... We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We were in a group of 11 people on a Saturday night.  The place was half full.  The foods was phenomenal.  Ok,  now the bad part.  It took 1 hour to get our appetizer s, then another 20 minutes to get our entrees.  Extremely slooooooooo service.  We were all dying of hunger until the apps came.  Maybe they just had a bad night,  but we will not return."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and it's a really great gem in the neighborhood. I'm so glad we have found this place! The patio is super cute, there's a back patio too that is lovely. The front patio has a big fire pit that warms up the area on a chilly evening. The atmosphere is great, doesn't feel like you're in a plaza or anything. The food has been on point. The baked tortellini is awesome! The warm bread is amazing! Friday's seem to be pretty busy. Ziggy, the owner, is super personable and chatted with us for a bit. Our new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"This joint is fantastic!  We've been here 4 times now,  for several occasions the last was for my birthday in December and it was very memorable thanks to Ziggy and his staff!  We all tried different dishes and there were No complaints.  The authenticity of the dishes served there is unlike any other place in the area.  We'll definitly visit again soon and I've raved to friends & family that they \"Must\" visit!"}
{"text":"I attended a UYE at Il Posto on Mardi Gras. I enjoyed it very much. I shared a pizza that was pretty darn good with Matthew K and sampled a few other pizzas with other people. I didn't much care for the crust of the pizza, but the pizza itself was very flavorful. My drink of the night was a strawberry lemonade alcoholic beverage that the bartender was having trouble getting right. Each time I had to help him out with the formula of sweet to sour, but he was a good sport about it. Our large group sat out on their clean a pretty patio. It grew chilly so they lit the fire pit for us. I can imagine sitting on the patio and enjoying drinks with friends here.  I would most certainly visit Il Posto again. Their pizzas were flavorful and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Fantastic EVERYTHING!!!   Great service, friendly environment, clean and OMG meatballs were out of this world!"}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the really great pizza and salad. Pretty cool atmosphere with a nice outdoor trattoria type patio and outdoor bar. Looks like there is a separate outdoor space for events.   We got salads and the margarita pizza, both of which were great. Nothing exceptionally noteworthy but overall a solid pick for lunch"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE horrible horrible customer service! No one deserves to be treated the way I was treated by this restaurant. When I asked who was treating me so badly I was told by another employee (Gina) that it was the owner of the wife. People beware! Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"North Phoenix is so lucky to have IL POSTO!!!   the pizza is absolutely fabulous... My 3rd one ( I don't review until I have been to a place 3 times)  was a marguerita with caprese.... I have to say, it was one of the best pizzas I have ever had.... (I'm in my 50's so I have eaten some pizza!)  The ingredients make the difference.... they are so fresh!  while I was waiting, the owner was showing me how the crew was making the fresh gnocci... THAT will be my next order there!!  Good gnocci is SOOO hard to find!    The patio is very quaint and will be a local favorite of mine as soon as it cools off!!  For now, I will dine in, or take out.... they are opening for lunch on weekends soon.... Can't wait!!!"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends for lunch on a weekend.  We all had pizza which was phenomenal...light, airy, crispy crust and fresh toppings.  We sat on the patio and received excellent service.  We will for sure be back."}
{"text":"The only reason I hesitate to review this place is because I don't want others to discover it. ;)  Love, love, love this place.  Cozy outdoor seating with a sweet firepit.  The food is always fresh and consistent.  Most notably, the tomato sauce is to die for.  The fresh organic variety specific tomatoes are specially shipped in.  But everything is excellent. Ask for the pesto sauce when you get the bread rolls - it's the best you will ever get."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant tucked into the corner. The food was so delicious and our server (I think his name was Benjamin) was very attentive and great. The outdoor seating area looked cute but unfortunately too hot to dine outside right now. We'll definitely be back, hopefully sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"My family and I love Ziggy's! The food is fantastic and authentic... So much so, that even my husband's in-laws (Italians from New York) were impressed! Ziggy & his family/staff are all great people. They let us throw a pre-wedding family mixer, and accommodated us so well! Food came out fresh & hot, and the family had a blast.  As for the food, the restaurant includes some of the best sandwiches I've ever had. My parents' favorite is the Italian Bistro, and for me it's a toss-up between the BMTA & grilled chicken club. Ziggy's bread is homemade and very tasty! Crusty on the outside, and seasoned nicely. You can tell he puts a lot of love into his food."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal!  Our drinks took extra time so free bread was delivered- so good.  The rest of the meal was exceptional- both in flavor and service. Meatballs are amazing!  Ziggy, the owner, and chef, came to greet us and check on us. When I asked about a specific Italian dish, (which is a challenge to make) he said if I gave him lead time of a day  he would work to make it happen.   Love that!!! Great experience!"}
{"text":"This place gets four stars for the patio alone.  Seriously, look for this review on a future \"best patios\" list.  Small bar, lots of tables, some open space, hearty gas fire pit in the middle, screened on all sides (with some very ornate facades, a wall painted like a billboard, hilarious \"laundry line\" replete with underwear and socks over head, and so on to break up the boring \"screen wall\" and add ambiance).  They have a gate towards the parking lot that keeps it from being claustrophobic, but the gate is small enough to keep out the noise from nearby 7th St.    I didn't personally try the food, but it did look good.  Definitely want to check it out sometime soon.    The one area they really need to improve would be the bathrooms.  With as much effort as they put into the patio, the bathrooms should be a few steps up from the nearby gas station.  That's really my only quibble at this point, and I won't deduct stars b/c I don't typically spend a lot of time in the bathroom.    Anyway, Il Posto is a great place, I'll definitely be back.  I may even brave the an evening or two during the coming summer months under a mister on that awesome patio, beer in one hand and pizza in the other..."}
{"text":"The \"Il Posto\" pizza is pizza done so right.  Pepperoni, sausage, bell pepper, red onions, olives, and the light sprinkling of garlic brings it all to greatness on a light thin crust.  The meat tortellini with alfredo AND marinara sauce covered with their thick smooth mozzarella is one of my top 10 dishes of all time.  I get extra of their tasty marinara.  You can't get this anywhere else and the mix of flavors and textures in this pasta dish are unbelievable in your mouth.  The only thing I don't like about here is the service... we have been going here since it was called Our Gang Cafe and the teenage hostesses are pathetic and the servers are a bit douchy.  They chill in the back gossiping like schoolgirls looking around at everyone in the place. When it looks as if your table might need something, they casually get up from their seats as if a burden of service has come upon them. I don't like it.. but I've never known them to be any other way so ehhh.  A good little Italian restaurant, while it may not make you feel all warm inside while their indoor center fountain splashes you throughout your meal, they have good foods so I'll be back."}
{"text":"Our group had a private party on their back patio. It was a group of 30. The owners were absolutely fantastic to work with on selecting food, beverage and pricing. Patio was set up perfect, service was great and the buffet style food we had was outstanding. Nice work Ziggys!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night, my second time and I think I can say it's one of my favorite  Italian restaurants in the valley!  The pasta I ordered (corkscrew with peppers, mushrooms, and sausage) was so flavorful!  I'm a big fan of flavor and spices and this dish is full of it!  I also love their oven fresh bread with the olive oil & pesto dipping sauce.  The service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"I live within walking distance of this place. And while it has a nice cool atmosphere for having a drink & smoke outside. Both times our server wasn't friendly or helpful let alone experienced. And the food is at best slightly mediocre. Next time I'll go to Taco's Jalisco in the same parking lot."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! The service however was horrible. It was a slow night with only a few customers and we still had to wait 15 min for anyone to come take our drink and food order. We had to ask to get additional water refills throughout the evening."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to go to Ziggy's ll Pesto today for lunch. Our service was wonderful our waitress was amazing our lunch was perfectly cooked, we had two appetizers, fried calamari, and the stuffed mushrooms they were both to die for. While we were waiting to order chef Greg Ziggy took his time out to come over to ask us if we had any questions regarding the menu, Or to see how we were doing. In all my years I've never had a Chef  himself come to our table, made us feel real special. My husband ordered a seafood manicotti and I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and I asked the Chef if he can substitute the chicken for shrimp instead and he was very accommodating and my daughters split a meat lovers pizza. The food was amazing everything was well cooked, Can't wait to go back. Thank you Chef Greg Ziggy"}
{"text":"I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and had It delivered to my hotel. My own tiny complaint is that they didn't put napkins or cutlery in the bag, but besides that, the food itself was good. Could have used a little more salt, but It satisfied my pasta craving and the Alfredo sauce was very hearty."}
{"text":"OMGizzle!!!! I Looooove CAESAR SALAD! This place has the best caesar in the PHX valley I've tried. Yum yum yum  #foodgasm   Amazing space, including a restaurant, a lounge, and beautiful patio spaces with North Mountain views! I love this little gem. So grateful I stumbled upon Il Posto. Will be back soon :D"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza I have ever had!! Go see Gina and get your grub on!! Order the fried cheese too. Great service amazing atmosphere for a date!!"}
{"text":"We just ordered thru UberEATS and had the Angel hair pasta with shrimp, salad and meatballs.  Everything was really good!"}
{"text":"Ziggy's IL Posto's is AMAZING! We recently had a large catering order and everything was delicious. I think we ordered a little of everything. The antipasto..a MUST,the baked ziti,best I've ever had. The meatballs are perfect size and FULL of flavor! If you enjoy eggplant,then you must try the eggplant rolitini! Delicious is a understatement. Greg's chicken marsala and chicken picata were also a big hit! Not heavy at all. Just perfectly flavored. I Can't forget about the PIZZA..it's a MUST! The crust is perfect,the sauce is perfect and has the right amount of cheese.I forgot to take pictures because we were all so ready to eat. Everything SMELLED and looked so good! If you are looking for a all around AWESOME dinner you HAVE to see Greg at IL Posto"}
{"text":"Fantastic Restuarant. Very Very good food, and so romantic. Sit on the patio, it's like you're really in Italy. I just love this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!! Good atmosphere. Friendly staff. Great hot wings. Pizza is fantastic. The owner makes conversation with his customers...."}
{"text":"Tonight was our second visit to Ziggys. Both times we've had delicious food along with excellent service. We ordered  dinner salads, cheese ravioli and eggplant parmigiana. The portions were very generous and satisfying. We also shared a bottle of wine for half price.  All around a very pleasant evening. As Arnold says \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Now, under Ziggy name, it has an uptight feel to it.  And last nite, went in to order apps and cocktails.  Pizza was incorrect, missing pepperoni on half of it.  We'd each taken a slice when we noticed it.  They took it back, put pepperoni on the other side, threw it back in the oven and brought it back to the table; the same pizza, 2 pieces missing and over cooked.  Who would do that?  A decent place would have replaced the pizza with the correct order.  Then, we were charged a 2 x $2 'entertainment fee'.  What?  No disclosure of this fee and I wonder if (and sincerely doubt that) it is applied equally.  Not like a door charge where you know everyone gets dinged.    Service seemed ok until after we pointed out the messed up pizza, then became a bit icy.  Probably why we got charged the 'fee'.  And a month or so ago, ordered some manicotti to go (usually awesome) but the pasta itself was hard (didn't seem over cooked, just weird pasta).  I won't be going back.  There are too many other places in town that know how to deal with their own screw-ups decently.  Re-fired pizza!  What a joke!  How small-minded."}
{"text":"The staff was great and the atmosphere is awesome. There's a great variety of menu items and on my visit it was pretty busy but the food came fast after I ordered it.   Definitely worth passing by if you're in the area. It's perfect for a date."}
{"text":"I used to love the calzones and pizza, as well as the atmosphere, at this restaurant back when it was Our Gang. So I was thrilled to learn it still existed, just under a new name. I bought a certificate on restaurant.com and grabbed 2 friends to try out Il Posto.  The fresh bread and delicious pesto dip they brought out was a good sign of things to come. We decided to share 2 dishes, and ordered a baked pasta dish along with the eggplant pamigiana based on Sarabear's yelp review - who I hope spelled parmigiana right cuz I'm just copying her spelling =).   Well the eggplant was every bit as good as she said! All three of us were very impressed by this dish. The pasta, however, seemed to be lacking in flavor. It was decent, but paled in comparison.  We had a very hard time deciding what to order as there were many mouth-watering items on the menu from salads to sandwhiches, and ofcourse the pizza and calzones. I will definitely be back to try out some others. They are also in the process of opening a lounge attached to the restaraunt, so Iook forward to checking that out as well!"}
{"text":"Delicious! my mouth is watering just thinking about my last dinner, Chicken Parm! Cant wait to go back, my new favorite place, and the owner couldn't be any nicer. I think Wednsdays  is half price bottles of wine. They also have a very nice supper club like lounge with the best happy hour around. Large house martini is $6 , and there house liquor is excellent! Glass of wine $5 and you can order food off the Happy hour menu or the restaurant menu. Great service.  The fabulous Chuck hall plays there every Tuesday. And an excellent Jazz band every Sat. night. You just cant beat this place!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Not a true (New York) Italian place (in my opinion) but very very close. Food is very tasty especially fried calamari app. I usually stick with fish or veal (not a big pasta person) but have sneaked some from my bf's plate at it was tasty as well as my dishes have always been. We are here fairly often."}
{"text":"Love their outdoor patio! The owners are super  nice and the food is always great!  This place is a real gem in the sunnyslope area."}
{"text":"Finally, after years of ignoring Il Posto and not being happy with the food, menu or staff, this place is back to its original finesse, quality and delicious food as in our Gang.  We met Greg, the new owner, and we could tell he is committed to bringing this place back to way it used to be, but with even better pizza.  I had to go back to my old standby...Cavatappi Matriciana , corkscrew pasta, spicy italian sausage, prosciutto in a light sauce.  Perfect!  My husband ordered the special, shrimp scampi on linguini with mussels.  He loved it!  Our waiter, D.  was helpful and attentive.  My birthday dessert (on the house) was a Caribbean rum soaked bread pudding.  And another nice little touch was Pauline, the adorable singer/acoustic guitar player that added to the ambience.  Nice touch, Greg.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has been around for a while-had a different name-remodeled and I could probably count the number of times that I have been here on one hand. I have some mixed reviews on this place. The stars keep falling as I keep going back there though.   First couple of visits were pretty good-yummy foods, good portions, tasty drinks on their beautiful ambiance of a patio.   Had a big birthday party on their patio back in April-it was very delightful and the waiters were pretty attentive to our large party(20+people)-they just keep bringing more and more bottles of wine-great time, but I was a little afraid of what the bill was going to look like since they weren't even asking anyone if we wanted more wine bottles opened.   I have enjoyed a nice satisfying meal in a booth with a friendly waitress on another occasion.   This past weekend I arrived on a Saturday evening at 6:15 with 4 other party members. We generously accepted red wine when we sat down, but had to wait over 45 minutes to get our starter dinner salads. One of my friends ordered a vodka cranberry and 2 of us tasted it and it tasted pretty \"nonalcoholic\" so we had to send it back to \"The Lounge.\" I felt like we were just filling up on their complimentary bread a pesto the whole time while waiting forever for our food to get to our table. The pizza selection was interesting-I think I could only find one with red sauce and the waitress was surprised to find the same results on the menu when we double checked. For dinner I shared a small pizza, and it didn't come out looking like what the description had said and I looked over at another friend and her husband's \"split\" dish dinner-it consisted of 2 ravioli's on one plate and 3 on the other-I felt so bad for them that I offered to share some of my share of pizza to them and they accepted with more satisfied bellies in the end. I don't know if the kitchen was backed up or what not, but I have recently heard from friends that it has not been a great experience at this restaurant for them either.   All in all the food and wine is good, but don't expect quick service or larger portions these days. I'm not sure you'll be getting what you're paying for, but hey I can't complain on the price too much since I used a QUICK TIP: RESTURANT.COM coupon on the last evening I spent there!"}
{"text":"The perfect local eatery when you are just in the mood to get out and grab some good food and drink.  Amazing lasagne and the bread was to die for.  Salads are excellent as was the wine list in terms of options to choose.  Very fair prices and great entertainment throughout the week. A must visit especially nice out on the patio in the fall.  Be sure to check on Groupon for a half off deal."}
{"text":"We discovered this place last night from the door man at The Nash downtown. We were deeply disappointed to find out that the show we wanted to see was sold out. So I was in a grouchy mood when we got to Ziggy's. There were no tables available, they were all reserved...but the server kept an eye out for us and made sure we got a seat. I REALLY appreciated that! (She had no idea I was down in the dumps.)  Tony Vacca was playing sax and Delphine Cortez was singing jazz. Even though I know nothing about music, I could tell she is incredibly accomplished and has a very pure sounding voice. After some classic jazz songs like Girl from Ipanema (in which she lighheartedly rearranged words) she sang Ode to Billie Joe as a request for someone that was having a birthday. Wow! Amazing range to go from an ehterial jazz sound to a kind of earthy, deep bluesy, slightly twangy tone. There was a high school age boy (Tony's son?) playing trumpet who was really great. Delphine was challenging him to a duel with notes and he was able to emulate her high pitched challenge on the trumpet...which was really cute.  The prices were very good and the food quality was excellent. The Wine Lover's Board was beautifully presented. They rolled the prosciutto up into a little rose which was very charming. Then, they artfully drizzled a balsamic reduction over it. I get these types of boards all over the Valley and this one really stood out. (Some of the chef boards are pricey and lame...where it's more about charging a lot for a small amount of food atfully displayed.) My glass of wine was a very generous serving and was $11.00 dollars but it was one of the most expensive on the list. It was really nice to see wine by the glass that started around $7.00. Everyhting doesn't have to cost a fortune!   Considering there was live music and great food...I'd highly recommend this place. It has a really nice, friendly, kind of neighborhood vibe. Good cocktails too at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"First time here and we had a fantastic dinner. great service and met the owner Ziggy. We will return"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise!  We had a Restaurant.com certificate to use, so we decided to head up one Saturday night to check it out.  We were seated on the lovely patio and settled in for a great dining experience.  The service was great and the food was even better.  I started with soup and then moved on to the baked ziti - huge portions, great flavor and so filling and ended my dinner with a cannoli.  I was absolutely in heaven by the end of this meal!"}
{"text":"We love this place and find the location, service and food to be top notch!  We've been multiple times and often visit the Lounge next door afterwards.  I'd highly recommend the pizza, lasagna (or pretty much any of the pasta dishes with red sauce) and they recently had these delicious meatballs as a special appetizer. Absolutely out of this world and not to be forgotten if available.  Plus, pretty sure you can never have too much Amy. She's a staple here- and an awesome personality. Pretty sure it'd be impossible to leave unhappy if she's serving you!"}
{"text":"I have now tried the place twice. This place has all the makings to be amazing and yet it seems to be having a serious identity crisis! The service is average and for a small place, that is sad. The decor is quite lovely and they have a beautiful patio. The food is pretty good. Although the specials seem to be the same both times we went. So obviously the chef doesn't much do local and variety. Prices aren't bad. Here's my two biggest complaints- 1. classic rock Really? 2.TV with football on. Are you trying to be a neighborhood pub (which is strange since I understand they own the Lounge next door) or a quaint neighborhood, indie restaurant? Either is cool, but pick one and do it well. My suggestion is go for the later since you have all the makings and so few of those up there in Sunnyslope. If you want good food with friends and family, this is your place. A romantic evening, chose elsewhere."}
{"text":"Talk about a secret local gem! This place has so much to offer. The food, being the most important is always delicious. Yes! Always, meaning we've gone more than once. It's authentic Italian food! The servings are on the larger side so this makes the family sharing and trying is a fun touch! They even have gluten free options. When Arizona has nice weather the patio is so charming, cute little courtyard, fire pit. The servers are always sweet and great service. If you are looking for a place this is it! Soooooo yummy"}
{"text":"This is my first time at this restaurant. We had the mushrooms and the mozzarella appetizers they were both fantastic. We ordered a pizza for dinner and it was great! Dylan was our waiter and he was ready to help us with any questions we had and was quick to serve. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ziggy's has the best pizza in AZ, it's that good! I'm a huge fan of every Italian dish I have had there as well! #teamziggys!"}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoy coming to Ziggy's. We regularly have their pizza and wings, but like everything else we have tried quite a bit. Check out their two great patios and live entertainment Wednesday through Sunday at The Lounge."}
{"text":"Food is so fresh and hot and not pre-made! The ambience outside by the fire pit with the Italian music is so relaxing. I love the staff here as they are so accommodating. You honestly can't go wrong with anything you order!"}
{"text":"First, the faux Italian store front patio is creative, and cozy. Service is friendly, happy, and fast..The warm bread with olive oil, basil, and loads of parm is great! But what we really enjoyed was the baby green salad with pecans, feta, all mixed in a fine dressing..Next, a huge slab of lasagne..best I have had in years! We will be back!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were excited for a very rare and different date night. Decided to try somewhere new. The weather was beautiful so we asked to be out on the patio that had a few empty tables. Service was terrible. We didn't get to finally order an appetizer until over half an hour of sitting at our table, which we decided to order our food at the same time to save our server another trip. While sitting with empty drinks for 1.5 hours and a different server attending us because she noticed our anxiousness, we finally got our plates. Still no appetizer or refills. Our original server then came up to us and assured us our appetizer was still on its way and she ensured they were making it fresh. We had ordered mozzarella sticks. When we got them the cheese had hardened on the outside and they were hardly warm. Disappointment is an understatement. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Ok, I admit it: we're regulars...almost once a week regulars.  The bread and pesto is something both my wife and I always look forward to, as well as the friendly and very attentive staff.  My wife almost always has the baked tortellini: a great mix of tortellini and bubbling cheese thats always filling and satisfying. The linguini with clam sauce really should be clam with linguini -- the clams are so plentiful that you can barely see the linguini and quite garlicy to boot. The lasagna is huge and quite good, as are the regular specials of Zuppe de Pesche (a huge platter of seafood over linguini) and the Veal Sorentino, a wonderfully tasty dish of waffer-thin veal and eggplant with cheese and a delightful mushroom sauce. Recently they've had Manhattan clam chowder as a soup special, and its really fantastic -- I'm not a fan of the red chowder normally, but theirs is really top notch: plenty of clams, nice spicy broth. Its a must-order if its a special, as is the Veal.  The standout desert is the hazelnut tortufo, with the cheesecake and creme bulee being good and nicely dressed.  The decor is a bit odd -- they've recently redecorated with weird \"fairy\" wood and glass sculpture things that really need to be tossed out, and a few odd \"rustic farm implements\" that clash with the modern crisp decor.  But the food is top notch, and the decor is just a point of dinner conversation."}
{"text":"You have to try the Berry (strawberries, blueberries, etc...) Salad with the Salmon..... Oh man delish!!!"}
{"text":"Awful ownership. Overheard him yelling at an employee, not professional at all. We will not be back. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Great food and quick service. I really enjoyed eating at this restaurant. I was surprised to find such a nice place in this area!  Very good and will eat again! *Only downfall...closed on Mondays!"}
{"text":"The food is good. But one time someone yelled at me for parking in the Parking lot thinking I was living in the apartments next door. When in reality I saw a ton of garbage on the side of the building I was headed to pick up before I dined with with.  \"Find somewhere else to park! Your apartment parking is not out problem.\" I can feel your frustration but next time be sure you're speaking to the right person because I can tell you I didn't dine with you that night, or to be honest, ever since."}
{"text":"I ordered gnocchi on Uber Eats. I was impressed that they actually read my comments requesting half marinara half gorgonzola sauce with a side of bread. Everything was fresh, hot, and delicious! This was my first time trying IL Posto and I am happy I did! I am really surprised by any negative reviews. My food was so good I can't imagine even on the worst day the food could be that bad. Can't wait to visit the restaurant and try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time with friends! Had wanted to dine there for months cause the patio area is so Adorable! The service was wonderful and friendly! Amy gave us great suggestions which were all delicious! We all shared our salads and main dishes because the portions are very generous! Great evening! We will be back! Stuffed mushrooms and calamari were appetizers that are pictured!"}
{"text":"I think this may be the best place in Phoenix and I am so happy that I live around the corner. Service...amazing! Food.....amazing....! Truly people who care!"}
{"text":"Il Posto has some really good aspects and it has some so-so aspects.  The outside patio area is completely awesome. It's like you're sitting in a little Italian cafe, with one of the walls mocked up to look like the side of an old style European building. There are Christmas lights strung about in different locations, a small bar area, a lil fountain and some other cool decorations. It's worth a trip just to hang out in their decked out patio area, if only to have some drinks.  The service was awesome. Our waiter was totally cool, friendly and accommodating.   The fresh baked bread and oil with cheese dipping sauce was fantastic. Loved it.  They had local beer (Kiltlifter) on tap for only $3 a pint. awesome.  The salads and pasta entrees were just ok, which is the reason behind my 3 star rating. I just wasn't wowed by the main course. We'll definitely be back to try them again though, perhaps to sample their highly rated pizzas. I predict a review sequel in my future."}
{"text":"I was torn between a 1 star and a 2 star, but I decided on 2 stars because the complimentary bread and pesto they bring you while you wait for you food is pretty good. In fact, it was the best thing I had.   I ordered the stuffed mushrooms, and the stuffing was repulsive. It was dark black  and resembled mushed up soggy bread. I had to ask what it was, because besides tasting like bland mushy yeasty dough- it looked disgusting. They assured me it was mushrooms and bread crumbs cooked in white wine with seasoning- it may have been mushrooms and left-over stale bread, but I am certain there wasn't any seasoning- not even salt. Not good. I removed the stuffing and just ate the mushroom in the rich, cheesy orange sauce the shrooms were drown in. The sauce was tasty, but it's hard to make cream and melted cheese taste bad.  I actually make some pretty killer stuffed mushrooms at home- I would not serve Il Posto's  in my  kitchen- they were just bad.  I also had a simple dinner salad. It had canned olives, processed, maybe pre-shredded mozzarella- it came with a pre-made dressing. When they said, \"raspberry vinaigrette\"- I was not expecting a creamy pink pepto-bismol looking dressing. So weird...  Maybe I am just too much of a foodie... sheesh. I rarely eat canned olives, processed cheese and I make all of my salad dressings... it's pretty easy to make a vinegarette- there's usually only 2 main ingredients.   My wine was also not very good.  My server was nice, the hostess was nice, the manager was nice- I will say that although my server was nice- she presented herself very ditsy. I asked what was good on the menu and mentioned that I am vegetarian, but on occasion eat seafood- she was not able to recommend anything- she said, \"It depends on what you like... tee hee tee hee hee\". She sort of spoke in a baby talk way and giggled quite a bit- she also kept calling me \"Doll\", which was annoying. I think I caught her about to twirl her hair at one point. All the servers looked very young- almost like a harem of female teens. It is an interesting dynamic. I would not be surprised to find out the hiring manager is a man in his 20s to early 30s. Anyhow, they were nice- it's just the ditsy act is off-putting, unprofessional.  All in all- I have always wanted to try this place as I hike in the area often and have tried all the other restaurants around. The patio looked pretty cool- if cactus weren't wilting outside at dusk (summers in Phoenix- ugh). I will not be back though- The tacos next door are about 75% less expensive and 200% better tasting."}
{"text":"Great little Italian joint nearby with wonderful dishes at medium prices.   We love their olive oil and pesto dip and fresh bread. Great service with friendly and consistent staff.  Their outdoor seating area is reminiscent of an Italian street corner, very lovely atmosphere. Wine bottles half off on Wednesday too."}
{"text":"I went to Il Posto last night because I wanted to eat there one more time before I wrote my review. I go there for lunch with the work bunch on occasion. They have a popular lunch special with pizza and salad ($7), but I especially like the goat cheese sandwich. It's a flavored pita folded over marinated veggies and loads (I mean LOADS) of goat cheese! It's called a panini, I think, which threw me the first time because a hot pressed sandwich comes to mind when I hear the word but this one is not hot. Let me tell you: that is NO REASON to skip the burst of flavors this provides!  A few weeks ago, I was there to grab a quick drink with a friend. We sat out on the cute patio that is set up to look like a street in Little Italy, U.S.A. These people can pour a drink! I already had a dinner commitment, so I just noshed on the bread and pesto that was provided. The pesto was loaded with parmesan... soo delish! And, the warm bread was better than any I've found in Arizona so far!  Last night, I had a crab cake appetizer as my entrée. I got three for $11. Not much filler, but lots of diced veggies like onion, peppers mixed with the crab. I was full by the time I finished and could not have taken another bite! All together, I had two (generous) vodka sodas and the crab cakes (plus more bread and pesto, of course!) for just under $30.  I hear from a lot of people in the neighborhood how they miss Our Gang (what this place used to be called) and they lament the old meat sauce or some other menu item that got dropped when they changed the name. Last night, I found out the meat sauce is back! And, Matt, the manager has been very accommodating and open to suggestions every time I've had a minute to pester him about what's going on with the Lounge (the '60 era-Sinatra style venue they plan to open next door).  So, now I have my eye on the white pizza and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I joined the crew last night for the HH organized by the fabulous Christina P. Although it was my first visit and I generally like to sample a place a few times before reviewing, there were so many of us there that I felt that I had gotten a pretty well-rounded experience and had enough information to provide input.   Phoenix is known for its host of strip mall restaurants, but few can actually transport you to another place. The restaurant interior is a mix of kitschy Italian and moderately nice mainstream. The main patio is actually about the same size as the restaurant interior and is flanked by two cute NYC street scenes (think universal studios city scene) with each window telling a different story and the Statue of Liberty holding court. Very quaint! The back of the patio is taken up by a complete bar. The fire pit that others have mentioned is situated in the middle. The patio is clearly the place to be at this venue!  Service was spot on, which was unexpected for such a large group. I have to echo Georgie S., the bartender seemed to single handedly (with the exception of bussing support) kept our brood quenched and fed with no errors. He asked each guests name upon their initial order and remembered them throughout the remainder of the evening. No simple feet, if you consider that we had at least 20 people in our party and he was also serving the numerous other guests that shared our al fresco setting.  The manager Matt, came out to thank us for coming by and informed us that there is a separate patio in the back to accommodate private parties/functions. What a divine setting for almost any family or business gathering!  In addition to the ambience and service, there is the food... Oddly one of the best things of the evening was the free appetizer provided to each table, which consists of bread and a parmesan/pesto dipping sauce that is so infused with garlic that its sweet fragrance swirls in the air. Now as Bacon B. points out, this will stay with you (i.e.: if you are on a date, you should both eat some) but it is seriously out of this world! I also really enjoyed the bruschetta, which is a classic take on the dish in every aspect except size. More often than not you will receive four or six small slices of toast with some tomatoes and basil carefully assembled on top, but not here... instead you will be served a small flatbread mounded with fresh hand cut tomatoes, chiffonades of basil and more of that dreamy garlic.  I was also able to sample two of the new pizza offerings. The Roberto's (ironically offered up by the fabulous Robert M.), which was set off by a sprinkling of pepperocinis offering just a little kick, and the White pizza which had more of those rich garlic undertones. Although I enjoyed the toppings on each of the pizzas, I was left wanting more from the crust. Both were uniform in size and shape and a little on the tough / dense side, which made me wonder if they were not made in house. That said, it was not enough to detract from the overall experience and I will definitely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my 4th visit to here sat in the lounge first time took 1/2 hour to get a drink service was absolutely HORRIBLE 850 a drink just a horrible evening so disgusted! I would have never thought!  Thank god the entertainment was great and the reason I came will for sure be honest to anyone that ask!"}
{"text":"I found this place online, and I have lived in the neighborhood for 2 years and have never heard of this place or been.  We sat on the patio where they had misters to keep us cool.  The decor outside is great, one wall has doors, windows, and a balcony to make it look more like new York. There is also a big statue of liberty replica. The server greeted us quickly and brought waters right away. She was knowledgeable on the drink and food menu.  The music on the patio was modern acoustical hits, and we found it to be very enjoyable.  They have a nice selection of beer and wine so I decided to go with the craft beer out of San Diego called Sculpin IPA. We decided to start off with calamari and the breaded mozzarella.  The apps came out very quickly. The calamari was cooked perfectly and the marinara dipping sauce was so delicious.  The mozzarella was equally perfect on a bed of marinara with fresh basil on top. For the entrée, I ordered rigatoni bolognese which was delicious.  I would highly recommend this place and will definitely be back soon.  FYI, they have an adjoining lounge called The Lounge which has a wonderful selection of signature mixed drinks and after dinner cocktails.  We decided to pop in after dinner where I enjoyed a Moscow mule serve in the copper cup, we had a great evening thanks to I'll Post and the lounge!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience here for our first time visit. Myranda, our server was ridiculously sweet and the chef checked in with us frequently! We definitely will be coming back! Also, the food was very good!"}
{"text":"This place used to be \"Our Gang\".  Not much has changed.  I still adore their outdoor \"garden\" area which makes me nostalgic for Little Italy.  The bread comes out hot and fresh, you can dip it in a nice pesto.  The salad caprese is standard, nothing mind blowing,  The chicken parmagiano will hit the spot if that is what you are craving.  I will say that the pizza \"4 ways\" is good, but not terrific.  Everything seemed to need a little salt, or some red pepper or some kick.  However, this is a great little neighborhood place for when you want to go out for Italian but don't want something super fancy."}
{"text":"Finally brought my wonderful wife here...   We ate bread and pesto, more bread and pesto and a little more bread and pesto.   We also had Chicken Princesseola or something like that... Loved it. Except the risotto was mushy... bad mushy  We also had a pasta with sausage and stuff. It was OK, just a Tad boring.   The service was good, the price was fine, we too used a coupon and they had no issues honoring it. The math was correct too. LOL"}
{"text":"Wanted this place to be good because I often stay at a hotel down the street.  It was not good.  Service was terrible.  Drinks took 20 minutes to get there, had to ask for silverware, salt and pepper and red pepper., server was cute  an bubbly, but she was bad at her job.  Double charged for glass of wine, never checked back after entrees arrived.  Food was Ok and priced right, but too much to overcome.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"All I can say is this place is phenomenal!  We came here on a whim while in town and were amazed at how great the food was and service.  We even used a restuarant.com coupon.  We have told dozens of our friends to stop by here if they are in town.  GREAT PESTO with the bread.  Yum.  Hubby had cheese ravioli which was to die for (and I don't even like the stuff).    Don't pass this place up, it was great."}
{"text":"I come to Ziggy's as often as I can because the food is outstanding. I personally am a pizza lover and I order pizza practically every time I go in and it does not disappoint at all. The pizza is amazing here! I went in the other day and was served by Taylor and the customer service she provided was fantastic. I could not be more satisfied with the service. Very friendly staff and excellent customer service. I recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family. Great place to dine in!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Complimentary bread and garlic butter is hot and fresh out of the oven. A neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"That has got to be one of the coolest patios in town for a get together.  I was another of the Yelp group (and friends) in attendance last night for happy hour.  We had a long table reserved for us.  The bartender was also our waiter for the evening.  To my knowledge, with all of us moving around, I don't think he screwed up a single order of food or drink.  The manager, Matt, came by to check on us several times.  I arrived fairly early and before I was tempted to work my way through multiple baskets of the wonderful bread and pesto I ordered a serving of crab cakes.  They were quite good, certainly not enough volume to replace an entree.  I was offered several choices of pizza slices and accepted a bruscetta one which was delicious.  Of the many pizzas ordered I did not hear one person that was less than satisfied.  I do of sort regret not trying the white pizza but I was at that not full but no longer hungry point where I should, but don't always, stop.  We did cause one hiccup in the evening, many of us decided it was time to go at the same time and with all the separate bills to figure out at once it swamped the entire staff to the point a couple of people at the bar complained they couldn't get a drink.  Most of the night we ordered as individuals or pairs as we saw fit so we never overwhelmed the kitchen or the server.  I have yet to figure out why groups of people (non business) that are going to be there for a couple of hours anyway have to all order and get served at the same time.  We must have at least looked like we were well behaved, Matt invited us back."}
{"text":"A little late in writing a review of this place after having attended the event organized by Chrissy P.    The location was nice for the Happy Hour we all attended because it was a short drive from work.  Parking was adequate as well.  Everyone was out on the cool patio enjoying drinks that they have a couple bucks off of at this time.  They had Peroni on tap which was a plus.  The pizza I had was only so-so.  I love and know pizza and have had some fabulous pizza in my day.  This one, not so much.  The potential is there, but something was missing.  Not sure if it needed to be cooked longer or what, but it was a little soggy.  The mushrooms were fresh which was nice, as opposed to canned.  The only other thing I had was the bread and pesto dip.  I should have and could have eaten this all night!  The bread was warm and crusty on the outside and soft inside.  The \"Green Goo\", which I called it all night, was awesome!  I would like to go back and try some different dishes to get a better sense of the food.  Very cool patio with a neat sand fire pit.  Perfect for the nights we are all enjoying right now.  3 stars for now..."}
{"text":"I brought my family to Il Posto to use a restaurant.com gift certificate. We were seated quickly and greeted by a friendly server. She brought us delicious bread and pesto dipping sauce and I was anticipating a great dinner. Then the \"dinner\" arrived. The spaghetti I ordered was hard, undercooked, and bland. The (2) meatballs had a soggy texture and were completely flavorless. I sampled the fettuccine Alfredo and was again disappointed by the bland noodles and flavorless sauce. My daughter who usually voraciously devours all noodles refused to finish the Alfredo. My wife ordered the eggplant Parmesan and was also disappointed. Considering the price of these items, my whole family was thoroughly disappointed. Our attentive server was the only bright spot of the night. Our disappointment was wholly with the food itself."}
{"text":"This place is great if you like burnt broccoli, burnt pizza, and spoiled ranch dressing. I'm very disappointed the chicken Marsala was tough and over cooked and I don't know what the sauce was but it was not Marsala Needless to say we won't be going back.  For the price I expected much better food. The service was good but very slow."}
{"text":"Great little Italian restaurant in walking distance for us. Ordered the lasagna and the Alfredo. Food was really good.   Owner came round and asked how our meal was which is a nice tough. Had the same server on both our visits there now and he is very friendly and helpful.   Great that they own the lounge next door which is a great spot to have a quite drink whilst listening to some chilled music. Bar man Chris is more than willing to make any drink you want even if not on menu, which they are changing as they are new owners.  Looking forward to seeing what they do to drinks menu in the lounge previous owners had some strange drinks. Mojhito is a definite with summer coming."}
{"text":"Hidden jewel!!! Amazing food amazing, amazing atmosphere, incredible service !! Ben the bartender is cute, sweet , an knowledgeable!!!"}
{"text":"I am so thankful that we went and enjoyed Ziggy's for dinner & lounge on Saturday evening! The atmosphere is just perfect!!! We an amazing meal, and spent time in the lounge with live music and many other friendly people enjoying their time as well. What a great place! Great Dinner! Great Drinks! Great Service!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised.   The server was incredible.  It was a GREAT value.  We enjoyed our meals. Loved the environment sitting on the patio.  I had the Lasagna and Ash had the Seafood Manicotti.  The Lasagna was great.  I really enjoyed it.  It had a great texture, perfect amount of cheese, and was well seasoned.  The Seafood Manicotti was incredible.  I HIGHLY recommend this dish.  Along with dinner we each enjoyed a wine flight.  They offered a nice selection and we both really enjoyed the tasting.  I would highly recommend this spot.  Give it a try.  We will be back.  For the $$...you cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Ordered through postmates for delivery a little before 7:30.  Estimated delivery was going to be 8:00 for wings and a pizza.  Estimated time kept changing until eventually it was 9:28.  Although I live about 5 minutes away pizza was cold.  Wings were cool.  Pizza wasn't too bad after microwaving it and wings were tasty, although no longer very warm.   This was my first time with this restaurant and just from my ordering experience, I won't be ordering again or visiting.  Plenty of other good choices in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Such a great place right down the street from us. The food is so good and the staff were amazing. I can hardly wait to come back."}
{"text":"We found the staff to be friendly enough, it was the food that was a huge let down.  After eating we wanted to go do some Christmas shopping, but was unable to continue as I got severe cramps and gas after having the Angel hair shrimp dish.  We also had the baked ziti which was quite underwhelming.  We've gone hear a number of times, however I think that was our last sorry to say.  :-("}
{"text":"Cannot state enough reasons why you should try this wonderful restaurant. Amazing food, great atmosphere, cool bar and warm welcome. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed. See owner Greg, great owner."}
{"text":"The most authentic homemade Italian food in the valley... fresh homemade bread , hand-tossed pizzas. Beautiful patio seating area"}
{"text":"I moved here to Phoenix from a city that is well known for it's Italian neighborhoods and Italian food.  The first thing I missed when I had been here a month or 2 was good Italian food.  There are plenty of people that have claimed they found good Italian food here or there, but when I tried it, i found the places were serving something that may have included pasta, but had nothing else in common with Italy... so now after years of searching to find really good Italian food in the Phoenix area,  I can count all the really good places on one hand...  Il Posto is one of them.  In addition, it is a very reasonably priced place with a wonderful patio.  Their eggplant parmigiana is some of the best I have ever had.  The layers of eggplant are thin and perfectly crispy before they bake the whole thing in cheese and sauce.  The pasta on the side has a wonderful light fresh marinara.  Their scampi sauce is garlicky, but not too much.... and their Alfredo is made per order with the best cream, butter and cheese.  It's so rich that I have to limit myself to a once a year thing when I order their tortellini.  For lunch, try a Caesar salad, or a paninni.  This is one place where you don't have to explain what you mean if you want a white pizza.  It's already on the menu.    The patio is well placed and has fountains and plants to keep away all parking lot noise.  The decorations are fun and endearing to people who have spent any time in NYC's little Italy.... right down to the painted Mulberry Street sign and the laundry hanging on the lines overhead.  Now, I hear they have rented the storefront that is immediately east of their place and are opening a bar called \"the lounge.\"  I hope it will be as fun to go there as it has been to sit at the bar on their patio.  I will be thrilled to have another neighborhood hangout."}
{"text":"We can't get enough of this local Italian gem.  Every dish reminds of us Italy and tastes like the best dishes Mama made. Don't leave here without trying the Salmon,  Eggplant Parmesan, Chicken Piccata, or Zucca de Pesce."}
{"text":"Was trying to find a place for dinner and Ziggy's IL Posto's came up. The food in the picture looked pretty good so we decided to give it a shot! The owner was wonderful. Very friendly and kind. They were able to make my husband something that wasn't on the menu! Their hot wing oh my goodness are one of a kind!! AMAZING!! You can taste the difference right off the bat. The pizza... you can taste the time put into making the dough and baking the pizza, not your average pizza!! The cannoli's was a great dessert to the night! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh you need to eat here. So fricken delicious. I had the baked tortellini and I basically destroyed it. I'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little treasure to discover.  With a great personality and a versatile menu, Ziggys is a great place to spend an evening. From the wonderful homemade bread served before dinner to the excellent flavors of all 4 dishes ordered we had not one complaint. They have a good beer and wine selection and even offer entertainment. So if you are looking for a nice evening out, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Great family. Great history in the valley. Great authentic Italian. Great speak easy with wonderful live music. The court yard is spectacular."}
{"text":"Just stopped in here on Friday night for the first time   We were visiting a dear friend at the hospital right by there !!!  I cannot tell you all enough to come try this place , since I've moved here 10 years ago I haven't had this wonderful of food unless I made it myself!!!!  All of the staff was wonderful but We LOVE LOVE LOVE  MELANIE THE BARTENDER, she was so sweet and gave us good suggestions of things to try !!!  Thank you Melanie for being so great !!"}
{"text":"Yelp rocks. Without it we wouldn't have tried this place.   Started with the capresse appetizer and the stuffed mushrooms. The basaltic glaze and fresh black pepper were perfect. The mushrooms had and great taste and yummy cheese.   I had the special, chicken princessa. A great blend of lemon artichoke hearts roasted red pepper over fettuccine. Very very tasty. My man had the spaghetti with meat sauce. The sauce was hearty and very yummy.   Cheesecake for desert.   We will return. It's so good and close. Yay."}
{"text":"The Thai Chicken pizza is good. But the white NY pizza is not good at all frozen spinach on the pizza we can do better than that.! The apple salad with mixed greens was good. We were not impressed at all ."}
{"text":"3 1/2 Stars  Alright, I'll try and make this one short and sweet and follow the old expression \"If you don't have anything nice to say...\" because I really did like parts of Il Posto...  Let me start by saying that the staff was incredible!  About 20 or so of us Yelpers gathered yesterday for a Happy Hour organized by the fantastic Christina P and the staffers were very pleased to oblige.  Like Bacon B said before me, I'm always nervous about being a part of a large party because it is practically inevitable that they are going to screw up at least some of our orders, and it is guaranteed that mine will always be one of them.  That said this was sooo not the case here.  I was shocked!  We sat outside and were all served at our leisure by 1 bartender who I from here on out will refer to as Superman, because he obviously had some sort of magical powers to serve all 20 of us individually, simultaneously, and screwed up no one's orders mind you...  I'll continue to touch on the good.  The patio was great.  Very spacious area with a fire pit in the middle which added some lovely ambiance to the evening, and hey, who doesn't look better by firelight??   Now on to the less than good...  The Happy Hour specials were okay, to be honest I'm not thrilled by $1 off of things, I think it's kind of weak.  However, many of Il Posto's drink prices were already fairly low, so the $1 off could sway some.  First of all, I will say that their fresh bread and pesto dip which was free mind you was delicious.  The pizza though, not so much...Let me preface this by saying that I am from NYC and I take my pizza very seriously...it is a bit of an art for me  I don't want to say too much because I do want to go back and try some different things because the rest of the experience was lovely, but no, unfortunately, I did not enjoy my pizza.  It was undercooked, the dough was unimpressive, and I had to use a knife and fork because it was so soggy.  All in all I had a nice time at Il Posto, mainly because of the company, but I would be willing to go back and give it another shot."}
{"text":"Was driving on 7th Street through North Mountain park when Il Posto caught my eye. After meeting up with my \"little\" brother, I decided to take him to dinner there and check the place out.  Ambience: old world Italy mixed with Lady and the Tramp and a pizza joint. The patio is lovely, especially at dusk and in the evening, and was the popular place to sit. Try and get seated near the firepit if possible, as their portable heaters appear to be out. Reservations accepted (that's why we weren't able to sit near the firepit).  Service: below what I expected though not below average. Our server took quite a long time to take our order and also took a long time to bring out another basket of bread. There's also like, 3 separate menus: one for drinks, one for pizzas and one for the rest of the food.  Food: I ordered the mussels appetizer, but requested that they cook it in a white wine sauce, as opposed to the marinara/basil sauce offered on the menu. They obliged. It was pretty tasty, though some of the mussels were overcooked and very tough to get out of the shell. My brother ordered chicken alfredo (wah wah) and surprise, was not that impressed with it; he claims it was bland and tasteless.   Price:  both of our meals were in the $12-15 range, a fair price considering the large portions. I didn't finish mine and my brother took half of his home.  For best success: reserve a table for 6PM near the firepit on the patio, bring a smokin' hot date and share a big bottle of their finest wine. And their delicious pesto/olive oil mixture with a basket of hot bread.... molto bene!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Ziggy's on 7th street and Mountainview with some good friends last evening.  We sat on the patio and it was just so pleasant. The food was delicious and the service was excellent.  Our waitress; Taylor, was delightful; friendly and professional the same time. I recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family. Try it out. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We loved the patio almost as much as the pizza. The staff was very friendly too. I can't wait to go back. A great little find in this area."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant a lot and dine here every couple of months.  The patio with the Italian villa decor is charming and I love the firepit. This restaurant is were I take out of state guests because the food is so good. The fresh made pesto and warm bread is excellent.  I've tried numerous selections from the menu and I've never been disappointed. The spagetti carbonara is my favorite. They've taken it off the menu but will still make it. The veal scallopine, when they have it as a special is also very good . It's layered with mozzarella cheese and eggplant..  The service is good and so are the prices."}
{"text":"Il Posto is a restaurant my husband and I frequent after we moved into the Moon Valley area. The outside patio is cozy especially when the fire is burning and the weather is chilly, combine that with a nice bottle of red wine and it creates a warm and comfortable ambience.   Last Friday's dinner the atmosphere was just right, the sounds of cutlery, dinner chatter and my husband and I were gearing up to enjoy our favorite, the seafood house special and meat lasagna-until we learned the restaurant had been sold. Our experience with our server Devon was hands down the best yet we were leery of the change. As patrons we questioned the intentions of the new owner and we were doubtful, but by the end of the evening we had a change of heart.   The new restaurant owner, Executive Chef 'Ziggy' was wearing a maroon colored, double-breasted culinary jacket, he appeared fresh-faced and excited and his energy exuded charisma. I watched him crank up the fire pit to enhance our dinner experience and to our delight he suggested background music which we definitely agreed. He also expressed fresh ideas yet maintain the winning menu with a few tweaks here and there and even attested to staying faithful to the true character of \"her\" meaning the restaurant, as he looked around at his new haven.   Immediately, we took a liking to him especially as we watched him in action with the guests. He was courteous and welcoming from young to old, he demonstrated genuine appreciation for the patrons and reminded folks to sit down and relax. After all, that's why we come out to dinner right?  Needless to say, we enjoyed our experience that night and felt the future of Il Posto will not only continue to thrive but exceed success. We are excited and ready for the fresh energy and the few new faces, yet experience the same great Italian food on planet earth. This is a must try-period."}
{"text":"What a find. 5 years in PHX and never knew of this place. First it's big! Way bigger than it looks from outside. The patio is wonderful, inside dining room is good and the lounge is great. Had dinner at a high top in the lounge. Mussels Marinara was just perfect with good garlic bread for dipping. Grilled shrimp over pasta was good not great. Little did we know that at 8 a live combo starts playing. It was mo town night. So much fun. A lively if older crowd. Headed back on a Saturday for Jazz. Love this new find!!"}
{"text":"So I just moved to Phoenix and have been tasting about town. Don't get me wrong, Il Posto isn't going to blow you away with tastes you never dreamed possible...but for the friendly service and reasonable prices it's worth it alone!  Then the food comes! Awesome portion for a great price. Makes you feel like you are at your favorite relatives house for dinner. House made pesto is delish too! I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Brunch was one of the worst experienced. over-priced ($18 per person) and just off. a mimosa served in a tumbler filled with ice? lame. mimosas come in a flute, period. Euro- styled pancake was thin chewy and better off as a frisbee. Mexican scramble on tortillas was disappointing. I was hoping for something resembling huevos rancheros but was left with dry scrambled eggs on dry tortillas. the cheese was mildly flavored and the salsa did have a kick but not enough to make the dish. never again. this place while trying to be different failed. top it off, the waitress was annoying and ditzy. meanwhile, Scramble next door had a long line almost out the door."}
{"text":"Food is awesome. Idle servers, hostess and bartender socialize, eat and check cell phones in full view of customers. Busboy was the only one hustling; everyone else was just killing time in between service. Totally lacking in professionalism. Hostess chewing & snapping gum with a bored attitude. Wouldn't go back except I have another restaurant.com GC."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst steak I have ever been served. I ordered it medium, it came out bloody and I sent it back. After 20 minutes they brought it back and it was charred. It was so chewy and tough I couldn't finish two bites. Horrible. The server was incredibly slow and inattentive.   I may have a drink on the patio some day, but I will not eat at this place again."}
{"text":"Tonight was my third visit to il Posto and I have not been disappointed.  All the food I have gotten has been very good. Tonight I had the apple-arugula salad topped with chicken. I have had their gnocchi, eggplant rollatini, pasta with sausage, etc. and all has been good. Sitting inside is a very different experience than sitting outside; tonight there was no outside seating so we were forced indoors and the experience was not as good. I highly suggest outdoors if possible. The servers are usually young kids who don't have much experience, so don't expect a lot in that department. But the food is great, as is the ambiance."}
{"text":"Went to Arizona bike week in April of this year, and were there for 4 nights. We ate at this place 3 out of the 4 nights for dinner! It was AMAZING!!! Please come to Costa Mesa California!!! We LOVE Ziggy's!!! The Scampi, the Pizza, the Salmon!! OH MY GOSH!!  Thank you to the wonderful wait staff, who knew the 3 of us by the time we left. :) See you next year!!"}
{"text":"Overall, a great experience! The only negative is the speed in which we receive our food it took about 45 minutes to get our food. There were eight of us and I did not hear why it was so slow. It didn't seem that busy.      Now with the negative out of the way so many Great things. Ed, manager was wonderful, our server short haired female girl wonderful very very good server!! I loved it I had gluten-free pizza it had good cheese fresh basil big mushrooms and sausage. They start you with bread it was amazing and warm great pesto butter. We had everything from Caesar salad to basic spaghetti and meatballs and piccata chicken with an amazing sauce.      I really enjoyed the atmosphere it had low lighting good combination of decor and different entertainment each night they had an outdoor court and beautiful seating outside.      They had a great variety of wines in a good bar it was a great celebration place for our October birthdays!"}
{"text":"I liked it. We requested an outdoor patio table..so charming! Just like the other reviews, it resembles a little cafe. I wouldn't say authentic, but a cute attempt at making you feel away from the city. The firepit was also a great touch outside. The bread and pesto was great and very flavorful. The menu, as MOST Italian restaurants done on the West coast, lacks authenticity. It seemed bare. Not bare enough for me to not want to leave, just lacking the stuff I want to see from NY/NJ menus. I had the margherita pizza..tasty, not too greasy, and a nice crust. I requested light on the plum tomatoes-perfect. My husband had the jalapeno chicken pizza..it was HOT!!!  Adorable ambiance, and decent food. Not bad all."}
{"text":"Have been here before and the food is great. Decided to go last Saturday.  Patio was a little busy and I guess the lounge was as well. They do have live music .  We decided to sit inside dining.  Tables were not cleaned off... we'll wait.  Cleaned a booth for us.... keep in mind... inside was empty... but it appeared they were expecting a big party ( tables pushed together for about 20) Not a server in sight now.  Finally got water. One glass gone. Water refill. 2 glasses gone.  Finally a server. Yes... I'd like a cocktail... husband ordered a bottle of wine.  3 glasses of water done.  Wine comes...no cocktail. Server must have said 6 Times... I'll check on that drink. Ugh.  She also said we better order because big party is starting to come in. Gee okay. Thought I'd enjoy my drink before I order food... but sure.  We ordered the salad for 2. And I preferred the eggplant rollintini ( appetizer) I know it's huge.  Husband ordered specialty pasta with sausage.  Bread arrives. No cocktail. Well I might as well drink some wine. ( she did bring 2 glasses).  More water.  Finally she brings the drink. Kind of lose my interest in it because I had started on the wine already.  Then..... ( its easily been an hour)... she comes over and says.... I forgot what you ordered. I write it down but I don't know where I put it.  We did have our salad by then... Thankfully.  She was very nice... but come on... really?  As my photo will show... before the party came in.... we were the only ones in the dining room.  Food is so good... but tonight.... yeah... the service made me mad. Took most of it home.  Bill came.... I thought really? That drink should have been complimentary. Nope. Ugh.  I know I'll be back.... and hope they have stepped up their"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with Il Posto, especially after all of the mediocre reviews. My favorite Yelper, Christina P, put together a UYE here last night, and the event could not have been more perfect.  The bartender and staff were really friendly and made us feel very welcome. They have a fantastic patio with a fire pit in the middle which made for a perfect happy hour setting.  We happened to be there on the night they unveiled their specialty pizza line. I had the pleasure of trying both the margharita and the goat cheese & onion, both of which I thought were fantastic. They also serve bread with a cheesy pesto dipping sauce that was to die for.  Our group ending up trying a lot of different pizza's and everyone seemed to really enjoy.  I was pleased with their happy hour specials ($2 off specialty pizzas; $1 off appetizers, well drinks, house wines and draft beers) and especially pleased that they extended those specials for our group for the entire time we were there.  This is another time I wish we could give 1/2 stars because I would give Il Posto a 4.5... and I will definitely be back to grab another glass of the Chateau Ste. Michelle Riesling and snack on one of those delish speciality pizza's on the patio!"}
{"text":"We were thankful that the restaurant was open till 10. But the pizza is fairly greasy and a little over priced."}
{"text":"Zupa di pesch was phenom!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Good local spot!"}
{"text":"Extreme slow service!! It took them more then 40 min to get our food.. it was only us and one other table and one pick up order.. the food was good when it finally came out.. but they can use one more chef and one more waiter.."}
{"text":"These guys are class act. Waited and waited and they kept looking and nobody came to offer a seat. The sign clearly said wait to be seated. I'd give them -5 if I could. YES they saw me. They just kept talking in Spanish.  Wow. Good job guys. Hope management is proud of you."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here, one of my new favorite places for food.  Unfortunately, they need more help.  Ate their this last Sunday and only one server for outside patio.  She was tied up with a large party.  Took forever to get drinks, had to ask for silver ware.  The food when it came out, though, was scumptious! Had the lasagna, chicken picatta and eggplant parmesan."}
{"text":"This has become our favorite Italian restaurant.  Since we are Italian we are somewhat picky and Ziggy's gets it done!  We typically order chicken or pasta dishes and they never disappoint.  The bread is fresh with garlic/herb butter.  The primavera on angel hair with either chicken or shrimp is garlic heaven and delicious.  A relative told me it was the best Bolognese they ever had.  We take our out of town guests there.  It is quiet and the service is extra friendly.  Lounge next door with live music."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Il Posto while visiting Phoenix. Dinner was great, service was perfect. Our waitress was super nice and right on top of our needs. I wish it was a bit warmer I would have like to sit outside on the patio."}
{"text":"We visited Il Posto for the second time this past Sunday evening.  This was our second experience with the same server.  He was very inattentive and seemed as though he did not want to be there.  We had to flag him down when we needed anything such as more drinks and bread because he never came around after taking our initial order.  The restaurant seems to be ran by a bunch of young people and no management was present.  The restaurant was dusty and there were flies and gnats everywhere.  The food was mediocre at best.  We will not be visiting Il Posto again."}
{"text":"We have driven pass The Lounge numerous times wanting to give it a try. Then I noticed Ziggy's was attached. We finally reserved our dinner and it was one of our best evenings out since we moved to  Phoenix 2 tears ago. Dillon was a fabulous- the owners I assumed made sure we were well taken care of. The food was quality, top notch! We went into the lounge after dinner...great seating, service was great and the band was so much fun. Definately will be back!!"}
{"text":"I dont think the owner is very friendly.. I think the hours are kinda odd... Staff could be a little bit more excited to work there... Food is okay.. Pizza is good... Salad is bland, I could deff whip up something better at home. I love the pesto. Love the patio :)"}
{"text":"Took my husband to Ziggys tonight for a birthday dinner. The decor was dingy and old with higher end prices. The food was bland and disappointing. We refused to eat it and walked out. We are now at Babbo's having a great meal with good service."}
{"text":"I'm assuming everyone was there for the Smart Shopper deal for 1/2 off menu items excluded the drinks and desserts.  It was a busy Friday night.  We seat by the open kitchen.  Every dish looked and smelled so good.  We got to watch the Suns vs. Lakers game on nice big screen TV.  The kids enjoyed the Chefs cooking, especially when the pans were on fire.  I had tried their White Wine Flight (InfmGoose  - Sauvignon Blac, New Age White, and NapaCreek Chard) - $9.00.  I like the flight, however the New Age White was over ice, and it was sort of diluted.  I'm glad that we ordered the appetizers crab cakes and soup/salad.  The clam chowder was full with crabs, so worth the $2.00 add-on to your meal.  I think they forgot us after the appetizers.  Our food took a while to arrive.  After sitting for about 15-20 minutes, our food finally arrived.  I had ordered the Four Seasons pizza that came with 2 slices of the seafood (scallop/shrimp), margherita, mushroom & plum tomatoes, and prosciutto with shaved parmesan.  The seafood pizza needs cheese and sauce.  It was basically scallop and shrimp on a pita bread.  The rest of the pizza was just OK. They do have excellent paste dishes.   My friends had the Seafood Manicotti, Linguini with clam, and another pasta dish, which I can't remember the name.  They were all phenomenal.  The Chicken Marsala was a bit dry.  As the weather cools, they have a great patio area to unwind."}
{"text":"Tried it for the 1st time, and it was sooo delicious! We loved it! We will definitely order again soon!"}
{"text":"It is great that the place is in the neighborhood. It is just sad that it is nothing special. The only reason we go is because it is convenient.  The staff are always nice."}
{"text":"This review could have gone a very different way this evening....  We live in the area and love supporting local restaurants. Better food, unique experiences. We tried out Ziggy's for the first time tonight.  My review tonight may have ended with a 1 star review. The service was very poor. Perhaps a new waitress. Perhaps a little understaffed. But regardless, it was poor. We placed our order. Appetizer came out a tad slow, but not noteworthy. Bruschetta. Very good. Crisp, fresh crostini with a tomato/basil/Parmesan topping that obviously was made with a lot of love and care.   However, our entrees took forever. Almost 45 minutes after ordering, I approached the counter where I could see that \"Ziggy\" himself was running the pizza oven. I commented to him as constructively as I could that we had been waiting a long time and that nobody was really taking care of us. He apologized sincerely. I realized at this moment that our pizzas had not even been made yet or placed in the oven. He assured me that I would be next up.  Now, the pizza itself was extremely good. Perfect chewy crust with a crisp slightly burnt exterior. Not sure if they pull their own mozzarella or not, but it tasted extremely fresh. However, no pizza is worth waiting nearly an hour to receive during a dine in visit. This review gets 5 stars because of how the chef treated us. He made the bill right with us (least of my concern), came and set with us several times to discuss our satisfaction and the struggle of the evening in the restaurant. He was pleasant, didn't react negatively to the experience and stressed the importance that repeat customers are his priority in running the joint.   The food itself deserved 5 stars and while the service itself started out miserable, the chef/owner really saved the day and assured we will come back and give the service a second try. The food and care by the owner earned them as much!"}
{"text":"Their outdoor patio is a plus here, which is nicely decorated in an old world italian theme. Go when you can sit outside. Great menu variety and the food was decent. Pretty bad service, however, though they were apparently short staffed the night we visited. I'd give them another try."}
{"text":"Great, attentive and welcoming staff, great food, good prices, great location. One of our \"go-to\" in terms of Italian and gives me the old New York being from there originally."}
{"text":"Ziggy's has the BEST Italian food and the customer service is phenomenal. In addition, the owners are personable, good people. They have a beautiful outdoor seating area...the atmosphere is a fun, family place. I would suggest this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"This is tough.  Found this place via restaurant.com so we decided to check it out. Place appears to be a cute little mom and pop shop, we walked in shortly after 830 on a Saturday so it was an hour and a half  before closing.  The hostess was super nice and sat us right down and said the waitress would be with us soon. A long while passed and it took a reminder and apology from the hostess, but our waitress finally stopped talking with the other waiter long enough to come take our drink and food order.  While we were waiting for the food to come the real show started.......the waiter was coming in and out of the back to the waitress station eating what appeared to be chicken wings, our waitress and the hostess sat down at a table and shared a plate of pasta, and the most concerning item was the bar tender from the lounge side.   He came over to pick up a salad and as he has the customers salad in his one hand, he's sucking on his e cigarette with his other hand. I tried to grab my phone to catch this but he quickly walked back to the other side with the salad.  When he came back to the kitchen he was waiting for a pizza in the pizza oven and the was running his hands through his hair and rubbing his nose, then handled the pizza. Gross!!!!  Then the food came and somehow it made all the horrible service worth it.  It was amazingly delicious.  We had 3 dinners, an appetizer, and a dessert and all of them were perfect.  The 4 men in the kitchen working totally made up for the 4 slackers working the front of the house.  I would say if you like waffle house, you will love this place because based on the front, service, and sanitation habits of the front of the house, I would rate it a 1 star. If you base it on the food alone I would give it 5 stars.  If you can ignore poor service for good food, give it a try."}
{"text":"For those wondering, the restaurant.com coupons work fine, however the incompetent staff at Il Posto couldn't and/or wouldn't figure out 18% for the included gratuity.  The coupon clearly states that it would be included, so no surprise there..... ...but a big WTF when I realized looking at the receipt that they had either purposefully or accidentally calculated exactly 20% as the autogratuity.  Now by saying it may have been an accident, I'm really pushing things and trying to be nice because I overall liked the place.  I cannot honestly come up with an explanation as to how a person who'd graduated 4th grade math could read a peice of paper saying 18% and then calculate 20%, unless is was blatantly done on purpose with the idea that the customer wasn't going to figure it out.  SHAME SHAME SHAME  The decor here is a mish-mash of old and new, good and bad, nice and ugly.  They've recently done (some) remodeling, since I saw a huge dumpster in the parking lot, but they aren't finished inside.  There are huge areas where exposed surfaces are in need of paint or drywall, and a huge sheet of plastic hung in a doorway behind us, swooshing with every breeze of a server walking by. The outside patio area did indeed look very neato, like a street in italy or new york.  Inside, they have a dining area with warm wood accents, a lit-up fountain, and dim lighting (which i liked, but the mrs said was making her feel woozy) right next to the kitchen area's flourescent light fixtures and flourescent lime green paint.  What classiness the first area had was lost with barely a shift of your glance, since there's no wall or anything separating the two areas. The very uncomfortable booths have hard wood back and a butt cushion that's token at best, with the bottom of the seat being way too long, so your back can't reach the seatback so you are forced to chose between sitting upright with no backrest at all, or slouching so badly that a painful arch is in your middle back.  The food had good and bad, as well.  The bread basket with pesto dip was superb, and like many others have said, we should've simply eaten that until full and then left.    The lady's ceviche was a huge portion, and said to be very good (didn't eat it), but the tortillas I did sample were overcooked, looking only slightly dark but tasting burnt.  My NY strip pizziaola - after being ordered as \"tell the chef to aim for between Medium and Medium Rare\" - arrived at barely even MR, but was tasty enough with all that garlicy marinara (*SLICES* of shaved garlic, like in Goodfellas!) that the extra juiciness was okay with me.  I used more of the appetizer bread to soak up the bloodiness.  Mmmmm aus juis  The other had a penne dish with chicken and mushrooms in a brown sauce.  This was said to be all just fine, but my keen eye saw the chicken going untouched and a few peices of penne being pushed around.  Probing proved that all was not just fine, since the chicken was quite dry, and the penne was so barely grasping to reach al dente doneness that she thought at first it might be whole wheat pasta (the dim lighting may have contributed also).  Service was 'eh'.  Yes, that's right.  It was so generic, by-the-book, make sure we cover all the requisite phrases and checking in moments -- but nothing more than that -- that I cannot even warrant the \"M\" to give them the entire 'meh'.    When inquiring if we'd like wine, and asked for Spumante, the server replied, \"you mean Spumoni?!? We don't have that.\" We looked at each other.....I so badly wanted to ask \"so, you don't have the wine, or you don't have the ice cream?\"....but we both just gave a tentative \"okaaaaaaay...\"    Chose not to try getting any wine.   8^ |  There was nothing too horrible about the service, but nothing great either......  EXCEPT of course there was the fact that someone involved in making up the bill decided to _*help themselves*_ to a 20% gratuity when the coupon states that an 18% gratuity is included.  Even with the mediocre service, I would have added a personal table tip to the auto-gratuity, but I certainly did not do that once I saw the 20% on the bill. I also chose not to bring it up with the server, because it was obvious that they already knew that it was calculated at 20%, and I wasn't about to play the whole Pretend It Was An Error game. There was no mis-reading the coupon. There was no mistake in the math. It was *calculated* at exactly 20% with intention. So that's what they got from me.  Nothing else.  ...except this review."}
{"text":"Went on a random Thursday night.  It seems like the owners have a stake in all of the restaurants/bars in the same shopping center.    Didn't realize how cute the outside patio was, or I would have chosen to sit there.  Ordered calamari appetizer - best part of the meal.   Entree - seafood manicotti.  I try to stray away from fish with cheese, but this was really, the fish tasted fresh, and i did not feel disgustingly full after.   Overall, a nice little italian place, but nothing to go home bragging about"}
{"text":"I had such a great time at Il Posto!  We came here for dinner.  The weather was nice so we sat on the patio.  I love the ambience of their outdoor space.  It's like you're at a cafe in Little Italy.  They start you off with warm crusty bread and served with the most delicious dipping sauce.  It was olive oil with pesto and garlic.  So good!  For appetizers we ordered calamari and the seafood fra diavolo.  If you can handle a little heat I highly recommend the seafood fra diavolo.  It's calamari and shrimp in a spicy marinara sauce.  It's served with grilled bread for dipping.  It's out of this world!  For my main dish I had the cheese manicotti.  It was good, but I could barely touch it because it was so full from the appetizers.  I did take it home and I ate it for lunch the next day.   They were very generous on the cheese.  That's awesome because I really love cheese!    My husband ordered the chicken marsala.  I didn't try it all, but I snuck in a taste of the mushroom sauce. Mmm!  Our server was so attentive the entire night.  We were there with our Aunt and Uncle and between the four of us we devoured 3 baskets of their crusty bread.  (I told you it's good.). I loved how the servers were so willing to bring out more for us.  Excellent customer service.  Generous food portions.  Flavorful comfort food.  Il Posto has it all."}
{"text":"Tonight we were craving Italian and decided to give this place a try. I am so glad we did our dinner was exactly what I wanted.   We shared the fettuccini alfredo with broccoli and the chicken piccata. Both were excellent and huge portions.   Our kid had the penne with marinara and he was also pleased. Which is great because he is picky!   The owner stopped by our table to make sure we were enjoying our food and I really appreciated how genuinely nice he was. We will be back and we will tell everyone who will listen what a great experience we had at Ziggy's il Posto.   Thank you for the wonderful dinner."}
{"text":"Have been eating here for years, and sad to say every time we come back the service gets a little bit worse and the food quality or lack of availability of certain dishes gets worse as well. The Fra Diavlo appetizer calamari was very rubbery, a shame cuz the sauce was very good and kind of spicy. The arugula salad with apples that we ordered, came with really no arugula. It was nothing more than stems and look like a bunch of weeds in our salad. We sent it back and they comped it for us. We have had it many times before and it was delicious . Our server was very nice, told us that she work there three days a week, yet did not know anything about the menu, anything about the special that night or had no idea what the bar had to offer for cocktails and or beers! If it wasn't for the amazing ambience of the patio and the fact that we have had amazing meals here before, I do not know if I would return. We might try it one more time in hopes the food, service or any combination will be better.  Shame..this was my lil hidden gem back in the day....They need to train their staff and get back to the quality they used to have.  Miss it!!"}
{"text":"One of Moon Valley's secrets, this place is definitely a great place for dates! Great food and wine, reasonably priced, friendly staff, food prepared to your satisfaction, very flexible with menu and ingredients. everything is made fresh and tastes wonderful."}
{"text":"I have come to this place a handful of times over the years beginning when it used to be called \"Our Gang.\". I have always liked the feel of the place & the chicken piccata. I have taken different friends there, dates there before I met my husband, and no matter who I have gone with,have always had a pretty positive experience.  That said, last night I went there with my husband, immediate family, and best friend to celebrate my birthday. There were 6 of us. This time I ordered a simple spaghetti & meatballs.  I was surprised that I did not really like it.  I gave 1/2 the meal to my brother to eat after and 1 of the 2 meatballs to my dad.  I was also really surprised at the response we received when we asked for more bread.  We had eaten 2 small baskets each with a single little loaf of sliced bread, and when we asked if we could have more, the server said, \"I'm not sure. How many have you had?\" I thoughts he was kidding. But we were told we could have 1 more loaf of bread but after that we'd be charged $2.50 for each additional loaf.  What a crappy policy.  I guess everyone else liked their food ok so I gave them 3 stars. Also my husband. Enjoyed a bottle of wine for a great deal because it was a Weds. special they always run."}
{"text":"Had a group dinner there last night and the food, service and atmosphere were all top notch. The owner, Ziggy, spent time at our table giving us all a great experience. Go there and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Traveling from out of town a group of 12 stopped in on a busy Saturday night looking for pizza. What we were treated too was more then we could ever have expected. Ziggy personally set us up in The Grotto, a private room in the back. He treated us like family. The kids got pizza but the entrees sounded to good to pass up so we all got something different and shared. Top quality, delicious, fresh food. We will make this a regular stop on our visits to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I woke up this morning with Il Posto on my mind and garlic on my breath.   We've driven past Il Posto many times en route to visiting a friend who lives in the area, but hadn't taken the opportunity to stop in. Last night, that changed.   As part of a large group of about 20, I was concerned there would be too much confusion over drinks and food orders. Such was not the case. Our servers were prompt and attentive and were able to remember our names. Amazing! The bread and pesto they start you with is great. Even better was the insane amount of garlic they use. The bruscetta was wonderful. The NY Spinach White Pizza was out of this world!!   Our one friend is moving out of this area of town, but we'll be back for Il Posto."}
{"text":"A few months ago I drove by my favorite, remind me of back east wonderful Pizza place, and cried when I noticed it was gone. After sitting down and crying with a few friends who loved the place too, we moved on with plenty of grief mgt and support. Today I was thrilled to go here and learn it is the same owners and same place, just a new name. I am back in heaven!  Tonight I tried something different, a caprese salad pannini. It came with home made potato chips. ( Always a plus-yum) and greens to boot (Because you know your body needs those vitamins) The meal was great. I ordered a side servng of an Italian sausgage( My weakness and hard to find good in Az)  One was enough to feed 4. A little spicy and good. The only thing I did not care about was the sauce it was served on. I come from a place where sauce is called gravy and I like sauce thick not thin. But hey, I did not expect the sausage to have any sauce on it so no big deal to me. It was delish!I ended with Tiramusu, always a nice ending. I went home with a 20 extra pounds on my hips and in leftover doggie bags. AHHHHH sweet heaven!"}
{"text":"Ate ouside next to the fire, very quaint facade trying to give you the feel of eating in Italy.  Ordered the Baked Ziggy (Ziti) with Sausage. The sausage is probably one of the best sausage that I have ever had. Good generous portion of pasta and sausage. I ate all the sausage that night but could not eat all the pasta. The next day I ate the leftover, but was not the same without the sausage.  Nice little restauant, would like to try the pizza next time."}
