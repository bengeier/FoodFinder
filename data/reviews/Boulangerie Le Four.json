{"text":"Friendly place, very good Lebanese style pizza, freshly prepared wide selection, vegetarian and meat lovers even a desert pizza. They have frozen home prepared meals but did not try them. Prices are affordable for what you are getting. Not a fancy place but good for takeaway or for quick eat in place. Will come back again"}
