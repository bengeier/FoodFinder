{"text":"In my opinion, these are simply the best tacos in town. You can opt for the spicy Mexicano style with cilantro and onions or you can go gringo with iceberg lettuce and tomatoes. The hot sauce does not mute itself to traditional Midwestern palates. With 2 kids developing scary teenage appetites, it is conveniently located if you are heading in or out of town and.that hangry mood is harshing the mellow drive."}
{"text":"Nope!  I should have known better than to eat out of a truck.  Not sure how this truck gets 5 stars.  I ordered the chicken burrito.  It did not come with rice and beans as the pictures show.  The chicken is shredded chicken and is gross.  It was greasy and messy and all around not very good.  The truck is old and run down.  I would not recommend this place at all. I only ate 1/2 of it just because I was so hungry. It does not come with slur cream or cheese."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a quick lunch, got the $7 chorizo taco lunch special, it had 2 tacos, beans & rice.the chorizo was delicious and tasted fresh.They have a yellow step van in the parking lot of premier sound & design.I also got a 7 burrito lunch special later in the day, with pork.it read good also, but wanted the chorizo, but they ran out, it must be popular.this is more of a carryout place, although they do have a couple tables outside."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome tacos and quesadillas. Fresh and perfectly cooked. I get them Mexican style, the little one orders plain. I will try a taco from anywhere but I will only go back again to the good places. Let's just say I MIGHT be considered a regular here. Chips and salsa are not bad either. Good amount of onion in the salsa. Tacos come with either green or red salsa, go green - it rocks. Staff are friendly. This place is cash only but never fear - there is a Busey ATM in the same lot. Keep in mind, it IS a taco TRUCK folks. If you're looking for luxury, you are on the wrong road (hehe, get it?!). That being said, they post no health code violations so I will dig in, no worries. You can call ahead and they work with a delivery service but I have done neither so, I cant speak to them. But as for the tacos....um...YES!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in champaign to get tacos. Only $2 for a tex-mex style chicken taco. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Awful. I didn't expect much from a food truck in Champaign, IL but it wasn't even worth $7.  My friend who knows zero about food made me come here with him. I'm just glad I didn't get food poisoning, but I may need to reconsider our friendship."}
