{"text":"Nasty. Maybe most people wont know when their food is cooked in old oil.  The food stinks of burned over used oil. Really bad food quality. Definitely would recommend another restaurant over this one."}
{"text":"Excelent food and service! I am very proud to promote it to family and friends who come and visit. I went to the Philippines last year and honestly,  I actually missed their food even when we're back home. Their food here is much better than most we've visited in the Philippines -- that's how good it is!"}
{"text":"The best filipino joint in the city of Calgary.  Ive been coming here for a few years and the reason why is that they have great food, great service, and a fair price.  The other filipino restaurants in the city don't even come close to this place in any category; food,cleanliness,service,quality.  Best Crispy Pata that I've had."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!  This is the worst restaurant experience that I have ever had in my entire life. The service was AWFUL!!! If you come here with your colleagues, make sure you pay cash, coz apparently \"it's too expensive for them to do the bills separately, as it costs them $2.00 per swipe\". Yes, that's what we've been told.   Also, the portion was too puny for a $12.95 worth of pinakbet, and was told that they don't put ampalaya in their pinakbet, coz \"madali daw masira\"!!!  The woman who \"served\" obviously did not want to be there, and had no interests with the business whatsoever. She was so blunt and rude to us, and treated us as if she's doing us a favor by us dining at this horrible restaurant. I keep my fingers crossed and hope that this person is the not owner; otherwise, this place will be worse (or WORST restaurant) than I thought.  I just also learned that there was a change of management, and this probably explains why. If you believe in customer service, then do yourself a favor and DO NOT come here!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for a Saturday afternoon lunch.  While the prices are a little higher than we expected (I think because of the platter we ordered) the service made up for it. We were helped by a few people who worked as a great team. Dishes were explained right down to what sauces would compliment what parts of our grilled platter. The food was tasty although some seafood was a little over cooked. We both agreed we'd go back and try other menu items as there is a lot to choose from.  I really can't say evough about the service. there was such a pride in what they do there and a genuine caring towards the customers. I felt, aside from the somewhat Maine themed decor, that I was being inbited into someone's home. It was really nice and I'm glad we went. PS The lemonade was very tasty and perfect for a hot July day!"}
{"text":"WORST & MOST RUDE SERVICE EVER! We were here today for halo2 since I was boasting to my in laws that it's the BEST in town. They're visiting from Edmonton. The lady asked 3-4x if that's it, and we said yes, so she went to get all our cutleries, since we are not eating anything else..come halo2 time, the spoons weren't clean so I asked 2 to be washed again since there's some dirt stuck to them, and asked for 1 more too because I'm sharing my halo2 with my 4 yr old son, the lady said but we ordered just 8 so why do we need 1 more so I explained , her face just turned sour so I just said that's ok , I'll share with my son instead. She said oh ok and gave it after. I saw her indifference and rude persona once we just said we're here for the halo2. While there , a family came, and she's commenting to them about customers who are complaining a lot. I suspect she's talking about us since we're the only customers at that time. But I just kept quiet. Come paying time she gave us a wrong receipt, then we told her about it, she just got it then went to get our correct one. She never did apologize. My point is, from the start, her rude attitude to us knowing we're the only customers there, and her telling the other table (I suppose she knows them), about us, where in fact she's the rude one from the start doesn't give justice as a customer on our part and for the other table to be glaring at me on my back( my husband saw this so he glared back) wasn't at all nice. We liked the halo-halo but NO, we will NEVER go back. Thus the 1 star..OH.. And yeah~ she forced us to pay the extra tip % because we're more than 6 or so, how about that?!!!"}
{"text":"Working in Calgary and my wife and I stopped in here after seeing it on Yelp. Nice small Filipino themed restaurant and very busy. Friendly and food was very good and fresh. I had a Calamari appy,  Halibut and chips,  and my wife had a chicken, shrimp and fried noodle dish. Mine was good but I liked hers better. Chopped pea pods really added to it. Everything arrived piping hot including fries.   Slightly out of sync as appetizer came after entree  other than that, no complaints."}
{"text":"Too expensive! Food is good. Every dish is 15$ or more. I don't think it's worth the price. You can get cheaper Filipino food else where. However, they do have good service and aside from Filipino food have authentic sea food."}
{"text":"7 Seas is a Filipino restaurant that really takes care of their customers. Despite not having anything vegan on the menu, DJ was more than willing to come up with veg-friendly versions of some of the dishes. Vegan La-ing (Taro leaves cooked in coconut milk)! I haven't had La-ing in ages, much less Filipino food, since most of it relies heavily on pork and/or shrimp as the flavor base. And they made the most adorable little batter fried tofu cubes just for me :) My drink glass was never empty, you never have to flag down a waitress here. But at the same time, they don't hover asking if everything is delicious.   Everyone else had a seafood platter, a beef soup, tripe stew, grilled halibut and a giant plate of crispy fried pork that was smothered in fried garlic. Goodbye, diet! I felt like asking if they had a wheelbarrow in the back so someone could load me in to the car afterward."}
{"text":"My favorite Filipino restaurant in the City!!! Everything is really really good!! Awesome service too!!"}
{"text":"This is THE restaurant for authentic Filipino food. Albeit I only ordered two items, from these basic dishes I know what their chefs are capable of.  The sisig was on point. Served in a hot platter and arrived  STEAMING and delicious. Topped with a slice of lemon , the meat was cooked and chopped perfectly. Garnished with red onion it was so succulent. There was options to top it with an egg and add spice, but I optioned out. Second dish I ordered was pan it bihon. Amazing..pretty close to home cooking. The noodles were cooked perfectly and I already knew what I was going to enjoy the next day at work. Garnished with a slice of lemon, it's all it needed. The mean/shrimp in the dish were cooked throughly and actually has taste to it. I will recommend this place. I will eat her3 again. Thank you 7 Seas see you soon!"}
{"text":"Hit and Miss   If your taking a group of friends to expose them to Filipino cuisine, this place will suffice. They have a LARGE selection of dishes and they explain (and sell) their dishes well. Their presentation of dishes is impressive.  If your returning, have found another place you can eat Filipino food, or a connoisseur, your not going like this place. My mom hates coming now, apparently they're missing key ingredients in their dishes,their pinakbet was missing bitter-melon which apparently made the whole dish redundant, and thus got into a huge debate with the waitress. I for one am not a big fan of their small portions (we ordered crispy pata and got BONE, just a few scraps of skin and a huge chunk of BONE) for prices that were from $15-20 dollars a dish, and when you hang out with cheapskates, good luck bringing them back here."}
{"text":"I have never been to a restaurant with such courteous, knowledgeable and caring service. It was Mom's 80th birthday and our family came in from London, England.   Mom picked the restaurant herself based on the fact she'd never had Filipino food before and it was already highly rated. Half the table had individual entrees and half shared platters.   Being a sharing kind of person I shared my platter anyway, but more on that later.   The seafood at seven seas is absolutely wonderful.  The Calamari (squid) so tender it could be (and was) cut with a fork.   The sauces were all explained and the we chose several dishes from barbequed beef ribs to crackling port,  mussels, shrimp, calamari and the lovely chopped mango chutney that came with our large sampler platters was almost salad like..   We also had tablemates choose the halibut and beef burgers.  They were cooked to perfection and generous in portions.   The crackling pork ribs were lovely, and rich and like many treats, more than enough to share.  The mussels were beautifully prepared and yes, everything was perfectly presented.  Those salty, spicy beef ribs were  best eaten first and hot, and the butterflied shrimp with garlic was scrumptious.  Garlic rice!  Yes, it was shot through with garlic but not too spicy and it complimented the coconut sauce and king fish. As if this was not enough,  Ate overheard us talking about Mom's birthday and suddenly at the end of the meal a lovely dessert with coconut strings and corn (yes real cooked kernels of  corn!) was presented with a song and a candle.  It is so rare to see this kind spontaneous generosity in restaurants anymore that we were all impressed. As we all know from our Filipino friends and the many Ate's who taught us about sharing, this is a restaurant, that, despite resembling an old Joey's Only in decor,  that is truly a place where we felt at home and we will be back again for another special occasion or maybe just  an appetizer and a drink!   The price of the food is definitely in line with the quality.   And for those who love seafood and great service, 7 Seas is a must visit."}
{"text":"I have been ordering takeaways here for years now and have always been satisfied with the quality and price. Last summer I brought my family to dine-in for the first time and didn't have a pleasant experience. It was Sunday noon, it took an hour for our order to come. There was also this lady who was serving, who appears to be either the owner or the manager or someone of authority and she was absolutely awful. She was clumsy, didn't smile and didn't apologize for being clumsy while serving. I will still get take aways here but will never ever eat in ever again."}
{"text":"I love this little place! DJ Melot & Ate Lirio are thebomb.com and they always treat my family & I or my best friend, Rachel & I like royalty! This is one of those places where I don't even care if the dishes are a bit pricey because they truly deliver. The Kare-Kare (ox-tail peanut stew) is delicious and their Grilled Seafood platter is divine! I once suggested they use different glasses for their Halo-Halo (shaved ice dessert) so it's easier to mix and they took my suggestion and now use a wider glass. I also really like how they have lots of options on the menu that are not Filipino in case you bring someone there who has never had Flipino food or would like to try other staples like Pasta, etc. If you come to Seven Seas I guarantee you will definitely come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Went here 2 weeks ago. The first time with my kids, we ordered crispy pork hock and fish sinigang. The sinigang was very flavorful, I had very little expectations for it since a sinigang is a sinigang. But boy was I mistaken, it was very good, as good as my mom's cooking. The crispy pata was a generous serving and very crunchy. After 2 days, I took my husband for dinner and we had their grill special with tiger shrimps, squid and ribs. The ribs was very tender and full of flavor. The squid was just ok. We also ordered another fish dish with coconut milk, and that was good as well. We will visit again to try out other dishes. Tip: the place is a bit small so make sure you come before or after the rush hour to get seats."}
{"text":"First time here and the food is awesome. The ambience is also very nice considering that from the outside it doesn't look like much. Prices are reasonable and service amazing."}
{"text":"Service: 5/5 Cleanliness: 5/5 Kitchen Speed: 5/5 Food Quality: 5/5 Value: 4/5  Checked this place out on Tiffany's recommendation.  They do service right here.  We were greeted warmly and treated like family the whole time.  Its kid / family friendly and you get the feeling that the other patrons would love it if you brought a little one along with you.  The food was prompt and by our standards, the portions were generous.  Its a very small dining area but they offer both take out and delivery as well.  The food was great, the dishes we had were comparable to Filipino family parties and the menu was huge.  The decor is a bit off beat because this place started off as a western sea food place with a couple of Filipino dishes but they soon found that the Filipino offerings were the most popular.  It doesn't look like an ethnic restaurant from the curb but Tagalog is definitely the predominant language here.  The prices are a bit steep for Asian food but not outrageously so.  I'd definitely go back.  Side notes: -Washrooms were unusually clean for an Asian restaurant. -They make a great cup of coffee (weird for an Asian restaurant). -The fish tank is well kept showing good attention to detail."}
{"text":"These guys really got it together. Personality, ambience, service, and of course the exceptional food and value. This could be a training ground for how to do food service exceptionally well! The only thing I could recommend is make a reservation and hope you can get parking"}
{"text":"Been here two times. One of my fave filipino resto, love the food especially palabok. They cook it perfectly. I would definitely go back here with friends. The price of the food is pretty expensive but they served foods in big portion."}
