{"text":"A good place that offers Turkish pastries. They serve one of the best kunefe in Montreal. They also have Turkish ice cream it is very tasty and different from standard ice cream and Italian gelato it is very authentic. The service is excellent. The manager of the place is a very nice and kind person. I've been there many times and now I consider him as a friend."}
{"text":"Delicious sweet. Very nice place, with friendly staff. Definetely worth the detour. Must try there Kunefe with the ice cream."}
{"text":"Best Turkish café of Montreal. Kunefe and ice-cream are perfect, just like the original ones in Turkey. The only problem is the location of café. It is far away from the city center. But it worths your time to come this place."}
{"text":"Hi. This cool new place opened up over the summer.  A spacious and brightly decorated interior, friendly staff and a assortment of Turkish ice cream, delicious pastries like cheesecakes, baklava and macaroons make this definitely worth the trip.  They serve Turkish tea and coffee, too."}
{"text":"Sheer pastry wizardry. This place came up in a late-evening search for something resembling dinner, and caught them shortly before they were closing. Everything still looked pretty fresh so tried an assortment of cookies and savory treats. The potato pogacha was soft yet crispy, with a nicely spiced interior. Cheese pie was a revelation and the spinach Borek had a subtle herby flavor which added a very nice dimension. For dessert I tried a couple of nut-based cookies that looked similar to others I had tried in the past, but the texture and freshness of these set them way apart from the pack. The little walnut roll was delicate and crispy but didn't fall apart and make a mess. The rounded rectangular almond cookie had a lovely sweet flavour and avoided being cloying thanks to a sprinkling of very crunchy nuts throughout to balance the sweet dough.   Highly recommended for delicious sweet and savoury treats (even up to their closing time)!"}
