{"text":"The place is whatever. We called in advance stating we were new customers and asked questions about the games offered. The owner was so eager to sit our party that we didn't even get a chance to look at the games and prices that were offered. It didn't click in until the owner came to us and told us that our game was over. I barley played but had to pay 15 for an hour. Which I think is nuts. I can take $1.50 and play until the game is over. This place is mediocre and the fact that the owner took advantage of the fact that we were naive and new customers makes it even worse. 
Of course we go to bars and expect it to be a certain amount per person. He could have approached it better and mentioned when we called that each game is 1 hour 15 a person. He left out 2 very important parts. He made my experience sour, had he told us all the details we still would have stayed and paid the price but he got greedy. 
Won't recommend to any friends or family."}
{"text":"Other than the friendliness of staff, I would have given this place no stars if I could on Yelp.  Came here for a birthday party and had a reservation for the life sized pool table was at 8.  We didn't get the room until an hour later - despite following up several times while we waited at the bar (apparently there were kids in there and they didn't want to kick them out).  When we finally got the room, it was just not fun at all.  Our server also didn't come by until 40 min later to take our orders despite asking for service several time.  Food was also gross - we ordered the poutine and it was very salty and cold!  Our friends' nachos had no toppings and was drier than a desert.  It also came so Late - around 1.5 hours from when we got the room.  The place is dark, dingy and dirty!  On top of this - our bill at the end of the night was so expensive!!!  I guess at least the servers were nice (if you see them at all).

Not a place I would come back to nor recommend."}
{"text":"The food was ok.
The place is meh. Pricy and not maintained well - uneven tables, holes in walls etc. The VIP room has no room to move around - definitely no VIP experience.    Electrical outlet  chipped / dangerous looking.   
Hot, fan tower barely helped.

The service was horrible - we waited forever, mixed up orders, drinks took forever (I.e. Pitcher of beer on tap took 28 minutes).  Shared our experiences with staff - didn't even get a sorry, more like \"oh ok, so you aren't having a good experience\". 

Too bad because if well executed the concept has potential."}
{"text":"newly opened they have soccer balls to play snooker. 

it was a little pricy for a place in Mississauga but it was good.

They were a little disorganized getting us our bills - we had to get a reprint 3 times. And after we
finished in the room, we were accused of not paying for it, so it was a little frustrating.

Overall a good experience - I give it 3/5 stars because nothing about it \"wowed\" me to give it a perfect 5.

I like the idea and concept behind it, but like I said the price is a little steep for food/drinks."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was great! Got the bacon cheese burger. Probably could have been more onion rings but it was delicious and service was great.

Had a really fun time playing snookball but it's kinda slow. So we made up our own games like \"protect your pocket\" or you have to pass 3 times before scoring, etc.  Be creative and it's awesome!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. 

Where do I start? We chose this place because it sounded fun; and at the time, it was new enough that there weren't too many reviews online. To start off, the concept of snookball is a LOT less fun than it looks or sounds. The game can get pretty dull pretty fast; however, I am aware that this is a subjective opinion. Nonetheless, the snook \"tables\" themselves are not well constructed and balls tend to roll off in one direction or the other depending on where the table slants. The tables are also poorly placed in relation to the bar where you place your drinks or eat while playing. Inevitably, someone will kick a ball into the bar, knocking over your drinks. We saw this happen at our table at least twice; and at the other guests tables as well on more than one occasion.  

The food at Baller's Bistro is seriously below mediocre. We even had to send one item back to the kitchen. Anyone who thinks the food there is good probably doesn't get out a lot. For starts, everything we ordered showed up at the table cold. The flat bread Margherita pizza was a sad, deeply underwhelming and bland little thing that tasted like someone put it together in their dorm room in a hurry. A tiny cold bowl of poutine will run you $7.00 and arrives with neither the \"ample amounts of cheese curds\" or the \"rich gravy\" as described in the menu. I have eaten better food at Cineplex.      

Lastly the service is just horrible. The wait staff are slow and painfully inexperienced. And when the bill arrived, we were charged $68 + tax + gratuity for the table which is the VIP pricing with a private room. We did NOT have a private room that night (normal rate is $58 + tax) and when we pointed this out to the staff they casually informed up that the \"rates had gone up\". This was confusing because my friend had booked the room at the $58 rate (over the phone) quite sometime in advance. After we pointed out to the staff that even their website currently does not reflect any change in rates, they begrudgingly changed our bill back to the $58 rate. As for the gratuity on the room...I'm not so sure that that should be added on automatically. Not everyone continues to order food while at the tables; and even so, none of the wait staff actually wait on you anyways. 

Someone asked me if it would be better to visit Baller's Bistro after they've had some time to get their act together. I expect they will go out of business before they get the chance."}
{"text":"Innovative concept and a fun game - we all enjoyed it. Seemed to be quite reasonably priced, as well (but that would be dictated by how many you split that cost up with). Also bias because we rented a private room, which seemed like a much better idea than a non-private room simply from space that you get with it (again, opinion largely dependent upon size of group you're with). Tables/balls were less than well kept and perfectly constructed though, so a fix in that regard would improve the experience. All in all, a good time doing something different for a reasonable price (and I could see us doing it again)."}
{"text":"The concept is awesome .Its $60 an hour. So it will be pricey if you think this is a date night kind of place. I guess limited space they need a deeper surcharge. 

I went on week night and they don't have any half an hour rate or weekday special to play the foot pool. So we decided to sit at the bar and eat. 

Drink menu was reasonable but we were hungry. Thought we would start with an appetizer- and that's where we stopped. Our Margarita pizza looked atrocious and tasted even worse. Raw basil on cheap cheese on a wet pizza dough that didn't look like it was cooked.

I didn't mean to be rude- but when the waitress asked me how the food was, I honestly responded \"Trash\". I am sorry but I get cranky when I am hungry and having to eat that made it worse. Luckily there are other food places around and that solved it because that app gave me a good impression of the rest of the menu.

I apologize for being rude as the servers and all the staff were genuinely helpful and very friendly.

I might be back with a larger group and have drinks and rent the foot pool area.

Food is bad- eat before you come!!"}
{"text":"Service is really horrible. Takes 45 mins to get anything from servers. There were only 2-3 our table and 10 employees. Don't go for food or drinks."}
{"text":"Yelp said it perfectly.  My experience was meh.  That's the only way to describe it.

My girlfriend was having her birthday here but was only allowed to order a choice of 4 different apps since I guess it would be hard to take individual orders in the kind of setting they have.  So 2 of my girlfriends and I decided to come earlier to order food and join the party after.

Service was horrible.  We were seated and then waited forever for a server to the point where I had to ask one of the people working there, if we even had a server?  10 minutes later someone was assigned to our table.  She was very friendly, so I give her that.  The food took forever once again.  Probably close to 30 minutes.  I ordered the chicken wings, and my friends got the regular poutine and surf and turf poutine.  My wings were supposed to be saucy but they were not saucy at all.  My friend didn't eat any of the steak in her surf and turf.  She said it tasted weird, like it was a frozen steak.  That's exactly how I felt about my wings, like they were frozen wings.  Even Pinty's frozen wings were better than these. The food is definitely not something they excel in.

We didn't play once we joined the party because we weren't really interested.  My gf that was having the birthday got one of the private rooms in the back.  They should've really re-thought the design because many glasses were being broken throughout the night.  The balls  were being kicked everywhere hitting glasses that were on the tables that lined the room.  The room definitely does not hold a lot of people so the extra seating they have in the back was pretty convenient.  I do not have plans to return at all.  If I have to come for another party, I'll make sure to eat ahead of time."}
{"text":"Skipthedishes review

Ordered their calamari ($13) and corn dogs ($9)
Po-gos would have tasted better and the calamari portion was extremely small. It was also over cooked and tasted like rubber. Wouldn't recommend getting delivery here."}
{"text":"Billiard meets football basically sums up Baller's Bistro. Instead of using a pool stick, you use your foot and kick football-sized pool balls. 

They have a few 'lounges' of pool/football tables. I came on Thursday 2pm with 8 work colleagues as part of a holiday event, and we booked one of those lounges (~$60). 

It's a fun idea in theory and has a novelty factor (#doitforthegram), but once you start playing, it does get pretty old fast. 

I'd say it's worth going with a group of friends just to give it a try, if you like billiard and/or pool.  

We didn't order any food (kitchen was closed at the time anyway) so can't comment on that."}
{"text":"Great concept,  just not executed properly.

I had seen this idea online and thought that it would be a great double date idea. Unfortunately it turned out to be a terrible idea.

Pros:
- great idea of \"snookerball\"

Cons:
- value. For the price that you are paying,  my group of 4 were barely able to finish 1 game. 5 minutes before the end of the game we were given our warning. 

-Service. A majority of the waiters and waitresses were just standing around. Hovering around the bar eating and doing nothing.  It was difficult to get our waitress to even help us out or place an order for food. 

-I have never felt so in the way. At our 5 minute warning essentially the hostess lingered around our lane and waited for us to break and told us we had to leave. We still had 5 minutes left, but that didn't matter. We still had food and drinks, but were told to hurry up and leave. 

-Food. Terrible. You definitely do not get what you pay for.  We ordered the nachos with beef. Order anything else off the menu. Save yourself the disappointment!"}
{"text":"We came here last night with a group of six. It was a lot of fun, basically a life sized version of a pool table made with soccer balls. I would definitely recommend coming with an even number of people as it makes it easier to have a team. It was nice that they had a bar table and chairs at each pool table so there was a place to put your jackets and drinks if you were ordering things. They do warn you about this but the holes to sink your balls into are quite deep so maybe not the best place to bring children unless they are very mindful of the space they are in. But overall we loved it and had a blast the area is pretty private as there are walls dividing each snookball table. We were all young adults and able to keep score on the conveniently located white board they provide. It's a little pricey but not too bad when your splitting the cost with a group. Overall it's a must visit!!"}
{"text":"A group of us decided to drop by last night for my birthday. It wasn't very busy so we were able to reserve a pool \"table\" for the next hour. We were helped immediately when we were arrived so there was no waiting around.

While waiting for our reservation time we sat in the dining area. They offer a full menu and have a full bar. We didn't try any of the food as we just arrived from dinner. A friend of mine ordered the poutine and she said it was good.

The soccer pool concept is different which makes it quite intriguing. It was very fun to play with a group for the 55 mins we got. We had 8 people playing and were able to fit in 3 full games. Be careful not to kick the balls too hard or else you might knock over someone's drink or even break it.

I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you're looking for something new to try."}
{"text":"A RIP OFF, the prices are way to high for what they offer! Foods ok not amazing... and not to mention the bougie atmosphere! Snookball is ok not that fun, the music is mediocre overall wouldn't recommend for a night out!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with friends and had a great time. It's basically a life sized pool table that you basically have to shoot soccer balls into each hole. It is quite pricy ($68) for 55 minutes on weekends or ($89) for a VIP room.

We also ordered food: Supreme Nachos, 2 in 1 Calamari, a pound of wings and Quebec cheese poutine. I would say the food is 7.5 out of 10. The nachos lacked toppings.. The calamari was good, the poutine tasted a bit weird, and the wings were great but cold. Pricing was it was very cheap, especially when dividing the bill with friends. 

The service was great overall! We had a wonderful server and she always checked up on us. The manager also came by to introduce himself and ensure we let him know if we needed anything during the night. 

I will be back! Thanks again :)"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of coworkers last week and we had a good time! Surprisingly, this place wasn't busy at all when we came - not sure if it may have been because we came around dinner time? There was only one other group that was playing on one of the life sized pool tables in the main area at the time when we left. There were a few of those tables in that main area when you walk in, as well as a few private rooms.  

A coworker had booked the VIP room for 1 hour for our group of 9 ahead of time since she had been to this place before. The VIP room had several small tables and chairs along the walls, which was great. There was also a TV mounted on the wall and of course, a life sized pool table with soccer balls in the middle. We were able to play a few rounds in that 1 hour and we noticed later that we were actually able to stay for longer than that. We were politely told that we could stay longer to finish our last round despite it being over our reserved time, which we appreciated. I really can't complain as we only paid about $13 per person, plus any drinks we had. Drink prices were on par with other bars and lounges. 

It seems that the lower ratings have to do more with some reviewers having really high expectations of this place, particularly in terms of food and customer service. I can't comment on the food aspect since we all had dinner elsewhere beforehand since our coworker mentioned that she didn't think that the food was that great when she came here before. Avoiding the food here seems to be the general consensus based on the reviews as well. I guess that's an area that could be improved on if this place wants to bring in more customers in the future. Customer service was fine in our opinion - we had no issues during our time there and when it came time to paying.

Overall, this place has a fun concept and recommended for larger groups. I would recommend trying it if you're in the area. Take it for what it is and if you go with the right group of people, you'll have fun!"}
{"text":"I have to say this was a little more fun than playing pool, and there was some team building happening when you involve your team mate in shot... but overall for $60 an hour for a field, that's wayyyy too much for a wooden turf covered floor with painted soccer balls on top.  I really wish the price was more comparable to a billiards place.

Want to come back, but can't really justify spending for an hour of play, so probably won't return."}
{"text":"I came here for my friend and her sister in laws joint birthday party. There were a little over 20 of us including kids. They made the reservation in advance for us to play in two rooms and eat after. The kids took over the room and had a great time. I just watched but I think it's a cool concept and I would bring my younger cousins here for an hour of fun. 

The reason why I rated this place 2 stars is because of the food and service. I don't know if it is because of the party size or this is how things are usually but I wouldn't come back here for food or possibly anything. Considering this party was booked in advance i found it weird that they asked if we would be eating and didnt have the table prepared for 20 ppl. We also didnt have enough table space or seats and moved tables and got extra chairs ourselves. At 7:55 we were seated and it took forever for our waitress to take our order as she was assigned to too many people. It was unrealistic for her to handle such large parties by herself. I didn't receive my entree till 9:20 when almost everyone was done eating. There were about 2 ppl who received their food after me.  Even though I was one of  the first to order and the waitress said she punched my food in first. I did order an appetizer as well that came earlier but it still came after the majority of the party was served. We asked for water at the start of our meal and received it at the very end. It was just a baffling experience. 


The food was mediocre. Some people complained of their meals being bland especially the steak. I found the calamari okay nothing memorable. I felt the same about the cajun Alfredo. The best part of my meal was my long Island ice tea. Probably one of the best I've ever had. They said that the late food would be comped but it wasn't. the birthday girl ordered a medium rare steak and they gave her a dry medium well steak. She asked for medium rare and they brought out another dry steak. She didn't eat it and they said \"your first steak that you sent back was comped but the second steak was discounted\". It was ridiculous that the birthday girl had to explain what was wrong from start to finish for them to offer to comp her meal and room (After they already said they would) I told him my meal came almost last and nothing was done.

In my honest opinion I'd rec coming here to play and eat somewhere else. However there are better overall experiences in the burbs. Funny enough, I've seen this place online and I've been asking/telling ppl about it. I was planning to check this place out for a big family outing but this experience  definitely changed my mind.

2 stars because I enjoyed my drink and the kids had fun."}
{"text":"Their billiards soccer gimmick was not worth the cost of $70 an hour. They make you pay a deposit which doesn't get refunded until the following Monday. But they'll make you pay the hourly rate the day of. Also how does a place run out of food on a Saturday night!?!?!?!? No onions for their burgers or onion rings, no guacamole, no tempura; no Montreal smoked meat, no cheese curds for their poutines, no ketchup. KETCHUP!!! How does an establishment run out of so many things on a Saturday. Go to 24 hour Sobeys and restock if you run out! We weren't even told half our orders were affected on the shortage until 30min after we ordered. On top of that they tried to charge my group double on our bills. It eventually became comical with the horrible management and service."}
{"text":"No.  Just no.  Take away the snookball and what do you get?  Breaded cardboard chicken sandwich and sad-looking pizzas.  Pizzas you can make at home using three ingredients (that's what it looked like to me).  The snookball game is so expensive, and it looks like it's not even fun.  Plus the place is unattended, a little on the dingy-side, and the waiters appear to be unenthused, but maybe it's from playing a game of snoozeball.  Won't be coming back.  It's in a weird location.  Not that noticeable, but probably for the better.  If the food wasn't so pricey I would actually give it two stars.  But it is.  Hence^"}
