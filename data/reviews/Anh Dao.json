{"text":"I've been really addicted to Vietnamese foods lately so I decided to try out the small family run Vietnamese Restaurant \"Anh Dao\" on Spadina. I've heard around that this place was famous for it's Nem Nuong (BBQ Pork Sausages) so I decided to try it out. Turned out to be the best sensation my taste buds have ever experienced! This special dish that you can't find at most Vietnamese restaurants (because it's very time consuming to make) consisted of rice paper (you have to wet it in the warm water, to soften it up), which you use to wrap the BBQ Pork Sausages in along with vermicelli and choice of vegetables/herbs. After you complete your very own roll, you get to dip it in the tasty Vietnamese sauce, which makes it taste AMAZING! Vegetables and herbs came in a bunch with a lot of variety and it was soooo crisp and fresh! I also ordered the Grilled Shrimp on Sugar Cane which was also very tasty in the wrap and the Vietnamese pancake that turned out to be crunchier then I expected (thumbs up for that!). Really good hands on-food experience and will most definitely come back when I'm feeling creative and hungry!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place based on other reviews. To my surprise there wasn't a single veg-friendly item on the menu. The waiter was helpful in adapting an existing meat-based dish, which was nice, but the food was only so-so, and lackluster for the price. This may be a great place for omnivores, but I'd avoid it if you're vegetarian or vegan."}
{"text":"5 stars IMO for a Pho place in Toronto.  My new go to Pho Place.  Fragrant broth, good cut of meat, not too salty.  Now, you don't get a choice of sizes which might be a problem if you are big eater or get full too easily.  But Pho is top notch.    Even the rice for any of their rice dishes is apparently made in the tradition way (told to me by my Viet wife) which I agree, makes it superior to other places I've tried.   Decor and size is cozy but updated.  I could see why ppl think service is not as good as it can be, since it seems the sons who are primarily the waiters are just there to do their time for their parents.    At the end of the day, like most real authentic asian restaurants, its about efficiency and not being that pesky diner.    If you haven't tried this place, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Food is 8/10 Service is 1/10  I like their food, one of the better ones in downtown. But service is HORRIBLE. I've been there about 5 times. Everytime I go there, no one is giving us menus and (most) tables are not cleaned. They just leave the dirty dishes on the tables and flies are having their meals (during the summertime). I understand it's a family business. But if you need one more server, then you need one. I am always left sitting there with no menus etc etc. I'm so tired of this - not going back anymore!"}
{"text":"When your Vietnamese dry cleaner tells you that Anh Dao is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Chinatown, you go ASAP. I went there for lunch with Neil \"Vietnamese Food Nazi\" T. and he gave it his \"White People Don't Eat Here\" seal of approval.  FOOD Their specialty is Nem Nuong ($9.95), rice-paper rolls that you assemble yourself at the table, featuring Anh Dao's famous BBQ pork sausage. You get 8 discs of dried rice paper, each slightly larger than a DVD; moisten one briefly in the bowl of warm water; load it up with fillings and roll it up like a burrito. The amount of fixings is enough to fill a horse trough; way too much for the number of rice paper wraps. But we only got 7 links of sausage which meant that my last bundle was without sausage:( I secretly think Neil got greedy and pinched an extra link for himself when I wasn't looking.   ***ETA: Neil says there were only 7 wraps and 6 sausages and that I should quit blaming him for missing food. Yup. Sounds guilty to me.***  Oh, man, the rolls were like snap, crackle, and shazam! My favorite combination in the wrap was a layer of vermicelli noodles, sausage, bean sprouts, cucumber, mint, cilantro, basil, Asian chives, and some slices of unidentified exotic fruit[1] that looked like a small Granny Smith apple but was drier and less sweet-tart. It's served with Anh Dao's \"signature house sauce,\" a thick, hoisin-based sauce. I loved the play of contrasts: hot-cold, smooth-crunchy, sweet-salty; and all the ingredients were like fresh from the garden.  The banh beo ($5.75), however, had that not-so-fresh feeling. The little rice cakes were not steamed to order, and the dollops of mung bean puree had the tell-tale crustiness of having been left out too long. Blech.  And just because we had to try their pho, we ordered the Special Beef Noodle Soup ($6.25 for one size) The broth was fragrant without being too rich, however, the noodles are dried, not fresh. I don't like quite so many ingredients in my pho (rare beef, brisket, beef balls, tripe, \"etc.\") so next time I'm going to try it with just two max.  SERVICE Stick to the pen-and-paper ordering method to avoid confusion or speak to the owners' teenaged sons who are fluent in English. Each dish hits the table as soon as its ready.  VIBE Much nicer than the usual pho joints on Spadina; the Buddhist alter behind the cash register and chattering of the Vietnamese clientele will transport you to Saigon.  BOTTOM LINE Get the Nem Nuong (or any dish with the house sausage) and keep an eye on Neil T. when dining with him. 4 stars =============================== [1] I still have no clue what this fruit was. I did an image search; it's not guava, soursop, or jackfruit. Any idea?"}
{"text":"This place is a family owned restaurant. I really enjoy their wraps which comes with a very large platter of toppings ranging from greens to pig ears. The pho, mun and rice dishes are good too. I also particularly enjoy the cane shrimps.   My #1 recommendation for Vietnamese food in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Finally, I'm all setup to write my first review.  This used to be one of my favorite place for traditional Vietnamese food. However, I've been quite disappointed with the service. We ordered some pork wrap #12 for my wife and I and two little kids. We ordered the medium size and was only given dipping sauce. So we asked for to additional sauces for my kids.   During the meal, the portion of vermicelli was very little and was enough for the wraps, we asked for more. They kindly gave us some additional.   When we asked for the bill, it has the #12 order and a drink we ordered. The bill has only those two items (that we ordered) and a total. No tax portion etc. I added up the price and it didn't add up. I kindly called one of the staff and told them that there maybe some mistake be abuse the total was actually more then what's indicated. They said there's nothing wrong because it also includes the 2 extra sauces that I have asked for and also the extra vermicelli.   I was very disappointed that they would charge you for the sauce and not letting me know that they are extra cost when I asked for it. Also they didn't even put that down on the bill. No tax portion, no extra items that was also charged on the total.   I was going to give extra tips but after realizing what they did, I decided not to.  I would gladly give a 4 stars to this restaurant but now I'm only giving a 1. Shame on you for charging extra sauces and not notifying the customer before hand and charging them on the bill without identifying the extra charges."}
{"text":"I was told by a Vietnamese friend that this is the Viet restaurant in Toronto - Pho Hung paled in comparison. So I knew that I had to try it.  Upon first stepping inside, I had my doubts. The place had a mysterious and unpleasant smell when I walked in. The menu was limited, but the server was really nice and accommodating, so I kept my judgments at bay. I ordered a curry beef satay vermicelli  - OK and imperial rolls - not even close to my top 5 Viet spring rolls. My dining partner had the pho special with tripe, beef balls, etc. - whatever. Not a memorable pho.  I went for dinner last night at 7 pm. Right now at 3:45 pm the next day, I'm still in an MSG haze. I don't know what they put in which sauce, but I didn't pay for this type of high.  Needless to say, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I used to date a Vietnamese guy and he knew the best Vietnamese restaurants in Montreal and Toronto and Anh Dao is one of the better places in Toronto.  I do like Pho Hung across the street -- the place with the cow-head on the logo -- but you can't get the speciality do-it-yourself rolls that you can at Ahn Dao.    You can get a plate of various grilled meats to roll in rice paper with various leafy vegetables and pickled assortments.  Do-it-yourself rolls are fun and makes you feel as though you've accomplished something when you've finished your meal.  They also have a wonderful sour soup; not for everyone but super tasty for those who like sour soup (me!).  You can get a decent sized meal for $10-$15.  Of course they also have the usual Pho (soup) and Bun (vermecelli) but if you find yourself seated in this tiny restaurant, opt for adventure and go for the do-it-yourself rolls!"}
{"text":"Pho had a nicely seasoned broth and was satisfactory. Unfortunately the fresh prawn spring rolls were not as appealing when we noticed the shrimp had not been deveined and was full of shrimp feces.  Disappointing as the atmosphere was nice and clean. Servers were friendly.  Please clean your shrimp!!!"}
{"text":"Overall good value for the food. Ordered Nem Nuong and it was good. It was very busy when I went but the service was quick. Usually more than enough for 1 person."}
{"text":"3.5  went a few weeks ago for dinner. it was super quiet when we first arrived and you know how empty restaurants can be a sign of a sub-par joint. but within 15 minutes, people arrived. my friend had this huge platter of vietnamese sausage thing. a banh? i had pho. it was not bad. a bit on the salty side and left me thirsty, something i don't usually experience at xe lua. service is alright, like all asian restaurants but i wasn't expecting any more or less."}
{"text":"Thank you Toronto Yelpers for recommending this place to me!   The food was great. We had the spring rolls and I had beef satay bun (vermicelli). The rolls were fresh and well-rolled. The satay beef was nice and spicy but didn't leave my mouth in pain afterward. So many places with spicy foods just kill you with heat, but this was a perfect balance.   Service was without a lot of chat. Definitely not a lot of English spoken here, but who cares? They gave us the ticket and we wrote down our own order numbers and everything was perfect. Love it! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Despite the good reviews and high hopes for this place, I was very disappointed. The food was just so-so, it wasn't really cheap either and the service was very, very bad. The waiter and the rest of the staff at the back were completely emotionless and very cold. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Amazing Authentic Vietnamese food! I love their rolls.  The chao Tom (shrimp wrapped on sugar cane) is especially delicious.  What adds to the experience is the exceptional customer service.  They were very attentive to all of my needs and accommodating to my child.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for Vietnamese comfort food.!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times years back, seem to recall that their pho is ok but nothing else really stands out.  Came here for quick bite on a cloudy Sunday.  Had deep fried spring roll as appetizer and pho tai nam for the lunch.  It's a small, family run business so one can tell they are under staff and service tends to be slow in comparison to other Vietnamese restaurants.  Spring roll comes with bean sprout and lettuce, it was perfectly fried with good flavour, but skin tends to be wrong.  Onto the pho itself, I'd say the broth is clean and subtle, obviously not the best I've had but one of the better choice around Chinatown.  They use ho fan instead of dry vermicelli like many use, which is good.  But all pho comes with one standard size and they do skimp on the meat tho.   As for the service, it's of minimum as they just bring you food and tea and disappear, they won't try to spend any effort to be friendly or make you feel welcome.  It's a passable choice for quick pho Chinatown, but I may suggest ordering extra noodle or extra meat of one wants to get full."}
{"text":"the service wasnt really good , it was dead slow..the price isnt really worth the food there. i got this pho called \"pho dac biet\" and the noodles was  like a ball of noodles stuck together. the rice there isnt good too. like its a small bowl of rice flipped over on the plate to make it look \"good\" but the problem is the rice looks nice but the whole plate of rice,meat and egg just looks weird like a face drew by a 2 year-old (no offense)"}
{"text":"The best item on the menu is the Viet wraps.  The broth for their soup items is delicious because it is loaded with MSG. I know this because have a sensitivity to MSG that makes me extremely sleepy... and I passed out almost immediately after leaving the restaurant.   If you order soy milk, make sure you ask for it with no ice. Otherwise they give you big chunks of ice in a cup and you only end up getting very little of the soy milk that costs you $2."}
{"text":"Oh I used to go to this place in my early 20's and it was amazing! I'm vietnamese and for years didn't like vietnamese cuisine that much because I was really into italian food and also growing up eating westernized cuisine made me shy away from anything asian but this place changes anyone's mind, it is so good, try the rolls that you wrap yourself and you will in heaven : )"}
{"text":"I have been going to Anh Dao for years and without a doubt this place has the best Nem Nuong in Toronto.  I would often ask for extra rice paper & a little knife to slice my sausage in half (length wise).  By doing this, I get more rolls & am able to use all of the vegetables that accompany it.  I tried their sour soup & found it wasn't sour enough to my liking (Bun Saigon further south on Spadina makes the best soup).      Owned & operated by a nice family, the food there is truly authentic.  Though high end restaurant is nice for special occasions.  For 'everyday' eats, Anh Dao is on my short list.   BTW Susan C, I believe plantain is the fruit that you are looking for."}
{"text":"More of a 3.5 - I'll have to go back (which I will) and try it again.  I had the spicy beef pho, which was worlds more flavourful than your run of the mill Vietnamese restaurant (i.e. the place across the street).  The prices aren't amazing - their fried rice/noodle dishes are downright expensive at around $12, and their condensed milk coffee - always a favourite - is an unjustifiable $4. The main dishes themselves are more reasonable at around $7-8."}
{"text":"Do people only rate because of food and forget about service? I am really upset because I came here based on people's review. I am on vacation, and since I came with my family, they wanted some authentic Viet food.   When we first arrived it was 12:06. The restaurant was supposed to open at 12. The guy opened the door and did not greet us. He didn't even seat us. He was so damn grouchy. Just because you're a grown man does not mean you could act however you like. At least respect my parents and say something in Viet! Is all service in Toronto Chinatown this rude that people give it such a high rating? Ok, enough of me yapping about the poor service here comes the food.   We wanted to eat family style, but like usual, I'm an outcast and ordered Pho. I won't deny it, the Pho was delicious. It could even be compared to the Pho So 1 in Dorchester, which is my favorite.   My family ordered, Ca ro: fishy to death! I am not lying, this was so fishy that it was so difficult to eat. My family loves fish, my dad is from the South and is a fisherman, but this fish was on another level of FISHY, the type you want to spit out and barf  Canh chua ca bong: Again, we are a fish fan, but not only that we care about the broth. Canh chua is supposed to taste sour because of the tamarind, however we did not taste any tamarind at all Stir fry chicken: The chicken was extremely dry, dry to the point where when you eat it you either drink water, or you'll choke to death inside the restaurant  This is the worse Vietnamese restaurant experience ever. My parents came out really disappointed, my brother constantly complained because he hated it that much. I waited to complain on yelp."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday for lunch. They don't open until 12 pm so we were waiting briefly outside until they opened. We were the first I the restaurant and sat in the dark for a few minutes as they were getting things set up.   Ordered rare beef pho and shrimp/pork spring roll. Pho was great, broth was rich in flavour, noodles were al dente and there were fresh red onions, green onions and cilantro as garnish.  Spring roll had fresh ingredients, quite enjoyed the freshness.  My husband got the vermicelli with grilled pork sausage. Sausage was tasty, the rest were pretty standard.  Service wise it was a bit slow. There was one server and one chef for the restaurant. We got our entrees and finished it before we got our appetizer spring roll.   Aside from the service, the food was good, you get what you pay for in terms of quality (was a little on the expensive side compared to other pho places). I'd come back though."}
{"text":"Small and quiet. Ordered their fresh roll plate. Wasnt able to finish it all.. the portions are huge! I'll be visiting here soon for vietnamese food again"}
{"text":"Excellent food if your seeking Vietnamese food on Spadina. The staff are very friendly and hard working."}
{"text":"Fellow Yelpers, Thank you for the reviews.  The reason why I tried this restaurant was because of the reviews you've all entered.    First impressions were it was small but clean looking.  For those who have young children, they do not have high chairs however they do have booster seats for those with toddlers.   As far as the menu, quite the selection.  Despite most of the reviews indication the roll ups were the way to go, I instead, ordered the rice with BBQ pork and was happy with the taste and portions.  Others in my group ordered the bamboo noodle soup and the beef noodle soup and were also happy with the taste and portions.   Overall I was quite happy with having tried this restaurant.  Due to the fact I'm not a native Torontonian, I can't compare others to this Vietnamese restaurant.  What I can say is that its a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Came here with a few other yelpers and for me it was pretty good but nothing amazing.  The food was good and pretty good value and I manage to stuff myself for under $20 which was not the best idea as I missed out on the food at the following event.  It is not a flash place but then again not many of the good joints on Spadina are.  The guy who was serving us was quick and welcoming.  Although the menu had a great variety of food for such a small place they really need to make them easier to handle. The flip board was kind of annoying.  We were the first group here by 6pm and by 7pm nearlly all the other tables were taken so its definitely a popular amongst the Asian crowd."}
{"text":"When eating at Pho restaurants 99% of the time I will order vermicelli with grilled pork and a spring roll (bun thit nuong). With that being said Anh Dao is at top of my list.  Cash only."}
{"text":"I always go this place for bun (cold noodle salad) with bbq pork.  For less than $6, you get a huge bowl of tasty noodles, fresh herbs, veggies, and beautifully grilled meat.  It's quite possibly the best bun I've ever had.  The services is a little indifferent but it doesn't detract from the food at all (for me anyways)."}
{"text":"Great lunch option. My friend and I ordered the do it yourself rolls, and a bowl of chicken curry vermicelli noodles. The rolls were filling and fun, (but messy!) we were actually so full after sharing the roll plate that we only dipped into the noodle bowl. Impressive for two growing girls.  The chicken curry was pleasantly spicy (not overwhelming) with lovely cooked onions. The dish was warm, however there was not a lot of meat in the bowl.  My real negative? The bathroom downstairs had a HUGE spider. Trying to pee while being watched by Charlotte, was sort of frightening. People should NOT downplay the importance of bathroom situation in the overall dining experience.  We paid $24 with tax and tip for the two dishes, with complimentary tea at the table, and left with a take out container for lunch today!"}
{"text":"11:00pm is a bit late late for a 12-year old boy to be working as a server. But then again, the service he provided was better than that of someone with 12 years of experience. Plus, I've been very wrong at guessing ages.  Broth here is absolutely, superbly delicious."}
{"text":"Fast, cheap, yet really delicious at its price. Nothing really to complain as this is a place you want a quick cheap bite. As for the service, I feel the owner(or just the chef?) are pretty chill with what they are doing, not super hospitality but it was not rude at all. So if you are expecting super attentive service here, you won't get any of that. But if you would prefer no one bothers you while you are eating, then yeah..  Cash only, which can be a bummer sometimes......"}
{"text":"I will go ahead and declare that this is my favourite and probably the best bun thit nuong I will eat in Toronto. At this point I have lost track of how many times I've ordered this dish here (I even joke that this is one of the pillars of my friendship with one of my best friends who also feels the same way as I do about Anh Dao and their bun).   Despite the ridiculously long itemized menu they have here, it is the only thing I ever order (and is probably the only thing I ever WILL order, it's 123 or 124 on the menu- the only difference being with or without imperial roll). It is cheap, satisfying (it could be two meals); they do a good balance of the herbs and the nuoc cham sauce is done well.  I like that this place has been around forever and has probably changed very little since the 70s (though they actually did recently re-do their menus). I hope they never raise the price or change the way they make this perfect bun! My aunt used to go here as a teen and the owner still recognizes her. Maybe one day the owner's son or even his kids will recognize me as well and refer to me as \"white bun-lovin' lady\" or something similar."}
{"text":"Still my favourite place for authentic Vietnamese noodles. I absolutely love this place because the moment you walk inside, you smell the herbs and spices that are brewed in the beef broth and the delicious meat.   We always have ordered the usual. Fresh rolls, and Tai Pho. Raw beef pho with extra noodles ! They use a different shape rice noodle compared to the usual flat type a lot of places use. The broth has a fresh, healthy and crisp taste. It isn't over powering and isn't too fatty or rich.   Make sure to have a Vietnamese coffee as well. This will keep you ready to go all day/ night haha. Strong and aromatic flavour.   We have tried their \"do it yourself \" fresh rolls platters too, that are skewers of various kinds of meat. Our favourite is the beef wrapped in exotic leaves. That has an amazing flavour explosion, the platter comes with fresh bean sprouts, basil, mint, chilli peppers, rice wrappers , noodles and of course the meat.  The family owned business is friendly and great service, perfect place! Could seriously eat here everyday .   Anytime your on Spadina stop by, and don't forget they aren't open Wednesday's. but rest of the days are good to go! And have CASH!!!"}
{"text":"How have I never noticed this place before?   I came here for a quick dinner with a fellow Yelper Avitania since I was craving pho and wanted an inexpensive dinner. We ordered a bowl of pho and the nem nuong, since a few people have reviewed it very well. I'd never had nem nuong before and I really enjoyed it. To be fair, if you pour enough nuoc cham on a phone book, I'd probably eat it. The food was delicious and came out quickly. It was a little more expensive than most Vietnamese places, but the quality seemed to make up for it.   The service was very good and the whole place looked and smelled like an old Asian person's house.. Asian spices, mothballs and incense with a whiff of air freshener. It transported me right back to being 7 and eating lunch at my friend's mom's house."}
{"text":"Not great vegetarian options if you're not in the mood for fish. But there's a quiet friendly feeling here, and the ingredients are fresh."}
{"text":"Tried this place out yesterday after reading these rave reviews.  I gotta say I was a bit underwhelmed.  First, they had no lunch specials, which for a student like me is gold!  Second, our appetizer came as I was almost finishing up my meal.  Not sure why that took so long.  And it wasn't even that tasty -- was actually quite bland.  I ordered a simple beef on rice dish.  The beef was meh, rice was good, and the little salad on the side was fine.  But this dish felt very much like something you could get at a Ginger restaurant (which I love).  My friend ordered a seafood soup, and he commented that the seafood entailed 2 shrimp.  It was a big soup, but he was a bit disappointed too.   I took a peak through the rest of the menu and they didn't offer many choices that I liked.  For instance, they had only chicken fried rice and shrimp fried rice -- not beef, no bbq pork, no yung chow.  Also, the prices weren't particularly cheap.  Most of the meat platters were about 11.95.  So for lunch (and as a student!) this was a bit steeper than what we were hoping for.  I'd still rather grab sushi for 5.99 and get a nice variety of foods.  I probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Ordered pho, papaya salad, and fresh rolls.  The rolls are freshly made.  Pho is decent although they are skimpy on meat and noodles hence the $1 for extra noodles.  Salad looks beautiful and tasted fresh and delicious.  Service as noted in other reviews is indeed  curt, indifferent, and he don't really give a rats arse.  Someone should try to make funny faces at him and see if he cracks a smile.  I think a career change is in order for him."}
{"text":"***1/2 stars  Was looking for a place to eat prior to the Yelp Elite Pimp Your Profile Pic at Lomography.  We arrived around 5:30PM to a relatively empty restaurant.  It really is a hole-in-the-wall restaurant with attempts of decor such as the paneled art on the walls (typical of a Vietnamese restaurant).  The kitchen is towards the rear of the restaurant and makes you not want to know how your food is prepared.  In terms of service, it is totally non-existent except for when they bring you the menus and pot of tea.  You will have to do cartwheels and somersaults to get service at this restaurant.  Food-wise, I am torn.  We ordered the Nem Nuong as other Yelpers recommended, in addition to Pho Dac Biet (Special Pho) and a rice dish that came with steamed egg, shredded pork skin and grilled pork.  It should be noted that all of their Pho dishes come in one size at a price of $6.25.  You do get a decent portion.  The beef was not the best, but the noodles and soup base were amazing.    The Nem Nuong that gives Anh Dao its reputation was a disappointment as I found the pork to be dry.  The mystery fruit that showed up on our plate were mandolin-ed plaintains.  I think that they should use larger sized rice papers as there is no way you can properly make a roll without it falling apart.  Either that, or provide a 2:1 ratio of rice paper to fixings so that we can half the Nem Nuong to make a neater looking roll.  The bean sprouts were showing bits of brown, which was kind of a turn off and I avoided using these in my wrap altogether.  We were also shorted on the rice paper as we had 6 sausages but only 5 sheets of rice paper.  The \"com\" (rice dish) was made with a short-grain rice and topped with scallion oil.  Compared to other Vietnamese restaurants I would say that this is probably one of the poorer rice dishes I've sampled.  I wasn't a fan of the short grain rice as it gets progressively harder to get off the plate - even with a spoon.  The grilled pork was overcooked, tough and dry.  The steamed egg was nothing exciting.    Verdict:  Horrible service, but pretty decent food.  I would advise that you stick to the Pho options on the menu as everything else isn't really that great.  I also wanted to try out the Grilled Shrimp on Sugar Cane (#14) but was informed they were out.  The damage at the end of the day was around $29 before tip. Cash only."}
{"text":"Over excellent value. Good fresh and hot food in good quantity. My only complaint is their noodles are too soft."}
{"text":"We like coming here in the fall/winter time for something warm and hearty. We will usually order the rare beef pho with beef balls, well-done beef brisket and tripe. They have a lot of other authentic Vietnamese dishes and some that have a modern twist as well, so there's good variety here.   Prices are good with respect to the portions and quality of the dishes.   We were never disappointed with the quality of food, everything tasted really flavourful, broth is great and they are generous with the other ingredients as well such as the mint and bean sprouts. Sometimes we even share one bowl because it is quite a large portion.   Atmosphere is very cosy, intimate and comfortable. It's a family owned business so it feels homey. It is a small restaurant as well; very quiet. Nothing much going on with decor but really the food speaks for itself.   Service is quite slow which is why I give it 4 stars. Not only that but the waiters don't really come around that much to refill water or anything, we usually have to raise our hand to ask. To pay we also had to walk up to the counter ourselves and tell them we were ready to get our bills and pay. Still, I think they are understaffed which is probably why service is slower than normal.   Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My favourite place for pho and deep fried spring rolls. Been to all the pho shops on spadina and the supposedly best one near queen and ossington but this one remains my fav.    The only one wish is the noodle portion could be bigger. Sometimes it is. Sometimes it isn't.  I guess it depends on who makes the batch that day.   Tasty soup. Soft meat. I get pho tai. And yummy crunch spring rolls. Not stuffed with soggy veggies like other places.  Good service from the younger guy. I forget his name but I think it's the son of the two older folks."}
{"text":"Officially my favourite Viet spot in Chinatown! This family-run restaurant serves up a mean pho, along with super flavourful meats in their rice and vermicelli dishes. Really hits the spot if you are looking for a filling and relatively \"healthier\" meal on Spadina.  Keep in mind that like many restaurants in Chinatown, this places is closed on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"The service is slow and (slightly incompetent).  The washroom stinks a little.  But the food is the best vietnamese food in Chinatown right now, so close to my mom's home cooking."}
{"text":"Per Susan C's review, I do in fact give this my \"White People Don't Eat Here\" seal of approval!  You definitely come here for the Nem Nuong, which is a Vietnamese pork sausage with some serious DIY veg and other random stuff I've never seen before.  Throw all that goodness in a rice paper roll with sausage and inhale through mouth.  Fantastic.  Pho was decent, above average, but nothing that wow'ed me.  Banh beo, which is tough to get at sit down restaurants, were a disappointment.  You're better off crossing the street and picking these bad boys up at the banh mi shops."}
{"text":"I heard Toronto is famous for their pho so of course we had to try at least one Viet restaurant during our time here. This was the first Viet restaurant that we came across while walking on Spadina Ave toward Chinatown so we decided to give it a try for lunch. It was good! The broth was super flavorful and the noodles were cooked perfectly. Really liked the assortment of meats. The BBQ pork over rice was spectacular as well. Spring rolls were very crispy and delicious. The place itself is a little old and run down, which seems to be the case with a lot of the restaurants in Toronto. It seems to be a family run business. Who I'm assuming to be the father wasn't that friendly but the son, who took our order, was a lot nicer. Prices were excellent! I think it was like $7.50 CAD for a bowl of pho, which equates to a little less than $6 USD. That's insane considering a bowl of pho in NYC can go up to $15! Overall, solid and affordable option for Viet food in the area."}
{"text":"Went there with the fam and we chose a lil bit of everything and We all thought the food was really good especially coming from a CA perspective."}
{"text":"Really good prices, very filling,,Had  pork chop rice. and satay vermencellie beef. Both  were great quality and left satisfied. Place was empty so food prepared quick.    Place was rated one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto. It's hard for me to say this was much better then others I've tried but worth a visit."}
{"text":"Best Viet restaurant in TO. Family run. Super friendly. Never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years as a recommendation from Vietnamese friends, I don't think I can go wrong... when the locals recommend it...   When you come here, you're not looking for decor and/or atmosphere.. you're simply coming for the food..no expectations for seating and decor..   I usually order the beef pho here and I'm never disappointed in the bold soup base, spring rolls work well as a side dish..when I come here with more people, it is good to share the rice paper rolls where you do it yourself...its somewhat interesting as I don't see this as often in other Vietnamese restaurants..  You can never go wrong with the Pho here as it's as good as it gets....pricing is reasonable for the size and quality that you get..."}
{"text":"The pho was good and the soup broth was delicious. However as others have said the service sucks. Our server didn't seem to care when one of our friends told him that her noodles were too spicy. He then said rudely that we can only have extra noodles if we paid for them. Also I too heard the microwave being run just like Jennifer K when I ordered the spring rolls. I won't be back."}
{"text":"In 2018 there is a HUGE portion of us who do not carry cash... Walk a bit to bank machine, pay 2.50 at Grossmans for withdrawal. Fortunately this place has fair prices. No DEBIT, CC in 2018 is LAME. Also turn on AC, hot as %uck."}
{"text":"best pho in chinatown!!! they also have some specialities that are hard to find in other pho places like the omelette and the skewer platter. i'm never disappointed when i get to eat here however............they're closed on wednesdays and ....... sometimes they've been randomly closed on other days too, seemingly without warning!!!!!!! just imagine the crushing sadness when you've been looking forward to a hot bowl of delicious soupyness to find it closed! so i would recommend calling ahead to check they are open."}
{"text":"Ordered a dry pho with soup on the side, stir fry noodle and Vietnamese coffee. The food portions were a generous amount which was a bonus. The food was average, nothing spectacular. However the Vietnamese coffee was so delicious! It brought back memories when I was in Vietnam for a week. Their coffee was strong and addictive. The coffee takes its sweet ass time to drip but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and really digging it, lots of different menu options than the average T-dot Vietnamese restaurant.  Last night we tried the \"Tom Bo Nuong Lui\" which was an absolutely massive plate of big shrimp wrapped in beef on skewers, with vermicelli, veggies, lettuce, mint & coriander which you wrap DIY style in rice paper. We had a large for $24 and it was enough to feed 3 peeps.  On my first visit I shared a catfish sweet & sour type soup and the Nem Nuong pork sausage dish mentioned in other reviews. Both were awesome. I liked the soup as it was loaded with veggies and had no noodles (hasta la vista, carbs!)  I was about to give Anh Dao 5 stars, but I have to agree with some of the other reviews - the veggies on my plate both times were not very fresh. Soggy beansprouts are kind of gross and my lettuce had dirt on it."}
{"text":"Xlnt!!! Clean... Tasty.. Lots of love in the place.. The bun was delicous! Fresh ingredients... Nice service.. I'll be back.. One note.. They close On wed."}
{"text":"Definitely a restaurant where you want to \"Keep it simple, stupid\"  Recommendations: - Vermicelli noodles with grilled pork.  - Durian milkshake - Chicken satay  I've been disappointed with some of the other dishes. It's best to stick to the basics. Beef was very overcooked, rice paper rolls are a lot of food, but it gets boring for sure.  Mediocre service. Not a whole ton of care put into it, but I haven't seen them make any major mistakes."}
{"text":"i went back the other day with some friends of mine and the vegetables were uber fresh.  i think the last time i went, it was close to closing time and the vegetables were sub-par, but this time, it made the nem nuong extra deelish"}
{"text":"Came here again yesterday, ordered a Chicken Breast Pho.  Unfortunately the chicken was very dry and hard.  So I'm updating the rating accordingly."}
{"text":"This place me my only go to place for Nem Nuong for years. Since when they started adding flour to their meat? Nem Nuong is not sweet, it tastes rubbery, reminds me of doughy fish cake/ fish balls, actually it doesn't taste like real meat at all!! What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"I'm Vietnamese and I have always been looking for authentic Viet dishes (something else rather than Pho) here in Toronto. Finally, I found Anh Dao and I think this is my new favourite spot! I had the S8 combo of 3 beef skewers with different flavours - they are to be wrapped in rice paper. Came with the skewers were a whole bunch of fresh herbs which most restaurants don't offer. The combo is $30 which I think reasonable.  I'll update once I try other dishes, there are many more special dishes the restaurant offers."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for dinner. Pho was extremely salty and was promptly followed by food poisoning.   Girlfriend and myself have been sick ever since.   Beware of rare beef"}
{"text":"try their sinh to sau rieng!!! i still remember after over a decade!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic vietnamese res. The pho taste like home made goodness that is 10 times better than pho hung's watered down broth. Their rolls are delicious and fresh.   Everything on the menu is of quality and made from wholesome ingredients.  Definitely worth the visit.  It is run by one viet couple, the wife cooks, and the husband handles the front.  They are closed on wednesday."}
{"text":"The bun here is pretty decent although skip the pho. The broth is ridiculously sweet. I'm the type that does not add hoisin sauce into my soup and yet it tasted like a whole bottle had already been poured in. Unless you like sweet broth, I wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"This use to be a decent Vietnamese restaurant. Their rice use to be a great dish that stood out from other Viet restaurants. However as time progresses, the taste of their food diminished. Variety is good, but none of their dishes stand out anymore. Taste is ok. I guess this is a decent restaurant to try out other Viet dishes besides pho, and dishes that aren't broth based. No specialty, but the overall food you get from there that aren't broth based are somewhat decent compared to pho restaurants."}
{"text":"The food I've tried here so far was delicious and authentic. The nem nuong (pork, rice noodles, bean sprouts, fresh veggies and herbs rolled into rice paper) here is delicious. The pho broth is also really good, but they skimp out a bit on the meat and noodles, so I'm not sure why they charge more than other places. Either way, I'm definitely going to be back to try more of the menu! Lunch gets pretty busy but service is quick.  Cash only."}
{"text":"Very impressive how authentic the food is. I've lived in New York quite a long time and could not find any good vietnamese place. Came to Toronto and found this hidden gems. I had the papaya salad, spicy beef noodle soup (bun bo hue) and pork sausage (nem nuong). Both my husband and I are so pleased with all the choices. Definitely a go-back place to try everything on their menu"}
{"text":"This place is owned and is family run.  I've been here a few times already and I would only recommend the banh hoi here.  Everything else is mediocre and  washrooms are terrible."}
{"text":"Very tasty pho, broth was flavorful with very generous amount of meat. Quick service."}
{"text":"The BBQ Pork Bún at Anh Dao ($5.75) consists of a huge bowl of vermicelli noodles topped with a heap of BBQ pork as well as fresh cucumber and lettuce. I love the contrast in taste and texture between the fresh vegetables, vermicelli, and pork. Delicious and an amazing deal.  Bonus points for clearly indicating on the menu which spring rolls are fried and which are fresh. I went for the fresh shrimp and pork spring rolls ($3.75 for 2). Again both delicious and huge; these suckers are at least 8 inches long (feel free to insert a crude joke here if you wish). The sauce the rolls came with was also tasty and even had a little extra protein** thrown in for good measure.  One of my new favourite spots in Chinatown.  **A rather large fly had apparently drowned in my spring roll sauce. I wasn't sure if this was unintentional or was some sort of bonus for particularly good customers. Perhaps I'd get good luck if I ate it. Or, at the very least, it would provide some extra protein. In the end I decided it was best to put the fly aside and return to the main meal. In any case, a bug or two in my food never bothers me."}
{"text":"Pretty darned good! Tried the make it yourself rolls. The food here was really really good. The service, could use a good bit of help though. From the perspective of \"oh, hey, its about a 30 minute wait for pho type foods\" and the \"why don't we bring out the appetizer quicklier if it takes a while to prep the main plate.  But, That's not super important as what matters more is the food. The fried rolls were good. Served traditionally with the stuff on the side to make your happy roll taco, but lacking noodles.  The make your own rolls with the grilled pork was very tasty and came with plenty of toppings. The only downside is that the skewers were one large honking slice of meat, and no fork was provided. I'm unsure of how other people get the meat off the skewer and into the roll without making a huge mess. I...made a huge mess...and felt really bad about it, but whatever! Tummy Supper Yummy =)"}
{"text":"The best Nam Nuong (Vietnamese pork sausage) downtown hands down.    If you come here for any else, you might not be impressed. Actually, I'm just gonna say it, don't come here for anything else people.  Just come here for the Nam Nuong and you won't be disappointed. I always get the Nam Nuong dish that comes with the rice paper, veggies so you can roll it yourself. You can customize your roll just the way you like it. I always load up on the veggies and less of the vermicelli noodles.  It's kinda fun to see who can roll the best. The taste of the Nam Nuong is always consistent, juicy, tender with just the right amount of spices. This is my go to place whenever I crave for Nam Nuong.   They are closed on Wednesday!"}
{"text":"This is a great little unassuming restaurant in the heart of Chinatown.   I came here when a Vietnamese craving couldn't wait anymore, and I needed something close to work! The yelp reviews are pretty meh (and they are warranted) but it was worth the risk.   The menu is actually pretty large, and has many items I haven't seen at other Vietnamese places in the city, HOWEVER, the craving was for a hot bowl of noodles with BBQ meat, and so I stuck with my usual Vietnamese order.   The food came pretty quickly and was hot and delicious.   So why the 3 star review? Two things made me think twice about returning to Anh Dao:   1. WHERE WAS MY SERVER???   I got seated and a menu right away, and even ordered pretty quickly - then the food came, and he was GONE! All I wanted was some hot sauce and hoisin, but it was like pulling teeth to get it. And when we wanted the bill? Forget it! He was no where to be found and we waited for about 15 minutes before being able to get his attention  2. SOOOO. QUIET.   Near the end of our visit, music finally came on which was a godsend. It was like a library in there! Even though there were other groups it was so eerily quiet that I felt like we couldn't talk at all. Awkward.   Overall, if the craving strikes again and I'm in a desperate situation, I wouldn't write off Anh Dao, but I certainly won't be looking to get back there any time too soon."}
{"text":"This business only accepts cash. Please start accepting debit card. The food is good here though."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a little girl... Mainly for pork sausage rolls. It's super delish here! Im assuming they recently renovated their restaurant because it looks quite different than from the last time I came which was a little while ago. I highly recommend this place if you wanna try some special rolls :) there are other meats but i forget what they're called"}
{"text":"Mmmmm mmmm mmm!  I went for the first time today with a friend who happens to be pregnant and all I had for breakfast earlier that day was a small muffin.  I'm telling you this because between the two of us we made a really respectable dent on a whole lot of food.  We got a small order of the DIY rice paper rolls with satay beef.  The small order had two generously sized satay beef skewers and plenty of bean sprouts and herbs.  So very, very good.  Once you soak your wrapper you gotta wrap quickly or else you'll end up with a sticky mess!  I had a taste of the noodle soup with beef.  Very nice broth.  I'm not a soup connoisseur so I'll leave it at that.  The crispy fried spring rolls were perfectly crunchy.  And the crepe was fun to eat.  We broke it apart and stuffed the pieces and the cooked bean sprouts into a lettuce wrap.  My friend had a mango shake which was very thick.  It was $38 for the two of us, which I don't imagine is normal.  We probably could have done without one of the dishes and been just fine.   Definite revisit.  Also it was clean, cool and calm inside."}
{"text":"I used to live a few blocks from here and miss being so close! Their vermicelli dishes are great, flavour ratios are perfect. Their Pho is always delicious, too. The beef is never too stringy, and whether you ask for mild or spicy, they will make it to your liking. The service is always great. I've gone for takeout, too, and the employees always offer great customer service and very quick preparation time. If I ever ask to adjust a menu item (by substituting something, removing something, or adding something) they never hesitate and fulfill my requests with a smile. The decor/overall aesthetic may not be anything fancy, but the prices are perfectly reasonable and the overall experience - from food to customer service - is always wonderful."}
{"text":"I like this pho restaurant because the quality is consistent and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Good pho, but the Vietnamese crepe pancakes didn't wow me; as they were quite flavorless without added hoisin sauce or fish sauce. Really crispy, but just didn't taste like much!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come and try Anh Dao Restaurant, but every time I came they were closed until last week!!  Timing is everything... but when the restaurant is empty and passed the prime lunch and dinner hours.. my showing up was not the most exciting thing that can happen to the staffs...when all they want is having their afternoon nap...zzzzzzzz  Spring Roll and BBQ Beef Bun ($5.95) - I heard a lot of microwave beeping in the kitchen when my food was being prepared... not really a good sign, so now my food is being heated up instead of cooking?? - Beef is a little cold... maybe they should have be put in the microwave for another 10 sec?  - Spring Roll was freshly deep fried..since it cannot be that crispy if it was just heat up in the microwave - I do love the mix of lettuce, basil and coriander in the noodle, giving it a more complex flavour  I did not find Anh Dao Restaurant really Amazing but is A-OK for the price. Maybe i need to try the House Speciality  Nem Nuong next time!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese restaurant for fresh rice paper wraps. You have a variety of meat choices with plenty of veggies to wrap with. Pretty much the only thing I eat there. There are two dipping sauces, both of which are delicious."}
{"text":"3-1/2 stars.  Went here for lunch on a Saturday and the place was 1/4 full which was fine by me as I was looking for a good quick meal.  I wanted to have some Pho, but I was a little disappointed with the lack of selection of Pho in the menu. Other Pho restaurants had countless combinations of meats you could choose for their Pho, but Anh Dao just had maybe 3 or 4 (I was hoping for rare beef, tripe and tendon).  Don't be mislead by the prices, the portions are large. I ordered the Bun with spring roll and BBQ beef ($5.95) and a fresh spring roll with pork and shrimp ($3.95). The spring roll was twice as long as what was pictured in the menu and the Bun was of your typical sized bun at other restaurants.  The spring roll was good and the sauce tasted like a thickened soy sauce sweetened with honey, similar to teriyaki sauce but lighter. The bun was also good, but not spectacular, but at less than $6 it was a great deal. I dumped all of the side sauce and added a little soy sauce and chili sauce which made the bun much more tasty and not as dry. The bowl was a good mix of fresh greens with the meat and vermicelli. Word of caution, do not eat the fried spring rolls first! I scorched the roof of my mouth by doing so.  The complimentary tea was tasty but served scorching hot in a large tea pot.  The service was fast and the waitor always acknowledged you with a smile.  One really minor gripe I had was that you helped yourself chopsticks and spoons that were bunched up at each table, some were sticking with the spoon or tip side up. For germophobes like me that could be a bit of a turn off."}
{"text":"Anh Dao - my go-to for pho near campus.   Given the huge selection of Viet restaurants around these parts, too many are surprisingly sub-par. I have always preferred Anh Dao over the others, but up until this year they lacked sizing options completely! One size does not fit all when it comes to food, never did and never will. In years past, it forced me over to Pho Hung where MSG overdose sometimes made me feel very jittery (I'm not usually sensitive to MSG, btw). But I digress, and it shall be made clear that sizes still do not exist. Rather, one can add $1 for extra noodles or $4 for extra meat. The former option is fine with me.   The owners of this family business are very nice. The noodles are slightly chewy, and the meat as expected. The broth is flavourful and always boiling hot. Undercooked bean sprouts are my pet peeve, but that's never a problem at Anh Dao. The food is not exceptional, but beating out the competition is all it takes when I'm trapped in the vacuum of good food known as UofT St. George. Anh Dao manages this handily."}
{"text":"Legit vietnamese \"homestyle\" food! Had the papaya salad, good portion. Serve with boiled shrimp and pork, crushed peanut garnish and rau gem(?).. Exactly how my mom makes it at home!  The pho my boyfriend had however was a little different to who he is use to, but he still slurp it up.  My entree was the grill shrimp wrap with beef. May I say Amazing!!! The ratio of serving is how it's suppose to be! lots of herb and leafy greens, served with Banh hoi, MmMmm... You need to know how to roll the wraps otherwise it will be a messy meal. So far, every dish was good. Had the Vietnamese coffee (too much milk for me).  Service?... 1 star. Reason??? Had to write our own order. arkward... The male waiter there was not friendly. Always seem pist off and doesn't seem to want to serve.. Seems like one of those asian kid that their parents force to work for free until they grow up, but it seems like he was stuck there and never got out... :-T  Overall. I would come back here if I ever visit Toronto again :-D"}
