{"text":"BIG disappointment for food....Popeyes, Church's, KFC are all better!  And, the drive-in ordering is super strange...you can order, but then a server has to bring your order out the DOOR, then go back in to get change, etc...ridiculous! !"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite spot to eat! The best fried chicken I've ever had. I work across the street and I'm here at least twice a week. Great customer service as well :)"}
{"text":"The service is ridiculous slow! To many workers doing nothing...cashier takes the order, then has to go make the order....manager does nothing to help...this place won't last long."}
{"text":"Sorry to say we were disappointed in this restaurant.  The chicken was lightly fried and tender but very bland. There were quite a few sides to choose from, but my mashed potatoes were definitely instant and my husband's corn on the cob was sadly over cooked.  We had such high hopes of a new Southern style fried chicken restaurant to stand out from all its competitors.  This is not it."}
{"text":"This is the worst chicken,gizzards,okra and jalape√±o poppers I've ever had#! The chicken has absolutely no flavor and the outside was so dry and hard it tears your gums up, the gizzards were like rocks and the okra was hard and dry like the chicken.my dog wouldn't  even eat it! The only good thing was the rolls,they are yummy! I will never go there again nor recommend this place #!#!  # HORRIBLE  #"}
{"text":"Tender Tuesday is the best! I will be looking for some coupons in the mail. It can get pricey."}
{"text":"Chicken is good, moist & flavorful. Husband got the gizzards & really enjoyed. Mac & cheese reminds me of something from the frozen food section. Mashed potatoes are ok but gravy I wouldn't get next time. 

I would come back for the chicken and would try different sides."}
{"text":"The day was the 30th of June... a memory in my mind that will never be forgotten. What started out as a seemingly normal day quickly turned to darkness... we should have seen it coming. But we were blinded..memorized by the \"Now Open\" signs. But they're only a trap. A clever ruse to lure in unsuspecting patrons. Set just right to attract the eye of the undecided hungry consumer. We all start off so ignorant. I should warn you, before you enter this battlefield, I strongly urge you to bring a paper bag.. it's brutal. When I first crossed the threshold of those lifeless doors, I was welcomed with not a cool breeze but instead an odor that mustered up a somewhat salty after tone, this smell permiated my person and violated me in ways I'm not comfortable to disclose. After coming in from the melting heat, and finding no cool relief, the next venture was crossing the dinghy gray floors covered in crumbs as far as the eye could see. Like piles of bodies littering the bleak landscape. I also noticed some plates of nearby civilians and could see the flimsy size of the tenders.. somewhat alarming I trudged on. As a real man stays calm under pressure, I knew I had to truck on for the sake of my starving friend. Starvation was imminent.. we had no choice. I thought I may find salvation when I reached the counter, but I was instead glared at by five of the locals.. it was clear that they did not trust me. Wearily, I tried to place my order with the woman at the counter who mustered what could be called a smile in some cultures; I didn't know everything that I should have as I missed mission briefing. So when asked to order a side, it completely caught me off gaurd. Still somewhat confused, I had to make a choice. Quickly skimming the lists I noticed mac and cheese was an option. This excited me beyond beleif. Since I was unsure of the chicken I'd seen before, I considered this a massive success. When my food came my initial response was dull. What lied before me certainly reminded me of meals from the trenches. One by one I tried each morsel that rest before me. And one by one I became more disappointed. The chicken was tough, and bitter. The most prominent taste was the salt that was off the charts. And the gravy was no different. Thank God for the casual mac and cheese or I would safely say this meal resembled the taste of homeless man feces. I do not look forward to my trip to the bathroom tonight, and my best wishes go to the toilet that must bear the load. As I write this, my platoon mate is emptying radioactive waste out of his nuclear reactor in the bathroom... I fear Fabreeze may not be enough this time... Regardless, head my warning. If you eat here, you may very well be sealing your fate.. and this could very well be your last mission. Proceed with caution brave ones."}
{"text":"We went tonight since this restaurant just opened. It was well staffed for the grand opening, but there were no specials or coupons. They have real people outside taking drive through orders in two lanes (with no shade, those poor things) but we went inside.  Our 4 piece tenders meals were more than enough food. There are two kinds of hot sauce, ketchup, and honey on every table. They also put multiple kinds of hot sauce and 'honey sauce' in our takeout bag, but not ketchup. We spent $15 on two combo meals, which I consider high. But the drinks are in large foam cups and the rolls are big and fresh. The gravy is a country pepper gravy that is very good. I did not see any signs of other dipping sauces available. The chicken tenders I would compare to extra crispy at KFC, but less greasy. If you are eating in, there are serve yourself fountain drinks, but as far as I could tell their famous sweet tea is only available at the front, so I do not know what the refill situation is for that. We got half and half sweet and unsweetened tea. My daughter liked it but it was still too sweet for me!  I would go back for happy hour or if I got a coupon.  3 stars because it is too pricey to go very often!"}
{"text":"If the other chicken is anything like the tenders, then you're pretty much getting breaded meat without seasoning. Mac n cheese isn't anything special either."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, I felt terrible for coming right at closing time, but the gentleman did not make us feel even worse than I already did for coming at this time. My daughter wanted their tenders. Shout out to Eric working nights for amazing customer service and taking our order at a late time. I feel so terrible for being so late but he made us feel just as important as any other guest."}
{"text":"Slow, very slow service. Waited 20 minutes. Cashier said they were short today. A line of 10 people and 1 cashier. The manager came out and finally helped add the line was at the door.. The food is good but if the service doesn't improve, this place won't last long. Come here and don't be in a rush."}
{"text":"The drive thru was quick. The food is average. Love the dinner rolls. I wanted to love this place but the fried chicken from the family meal is too salty. There's not a lot of meat on the chicken pieces, it's all fried skin. The coleslaw had an acquired taste, as if they added too much apple cider vinegar in the mix. The mashed potatoes are flavorless with the exception of the pepper overload. The gravy was good and gave the mashed potatoes flavor. The bread rolls were my favorite! Soft, buttery and mildy sweet! Love these rolls of fluffy goodness!"}
{"text":"Ordered the 4 pic chicken strips meal with mac n cheese. 
1 strip was hard and tough, the other 3 were good, nice and tender. Could use a bit of seasoning though, ...the mac n cheese was not too good, bland and needs more cheesy taste. The bread is really good. The gravy was good. 
I'm not sure I'd return again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the quality of the food at this location. Rolls were burnt and dry. Tenders were very small and were practically all breading and no chicken. 
Being from Texas I've had my fair share of Bush's Chicken and it never disappoints. So when I saw they opened one in Gilbert I was so excited. 
Unfortunately this Bush's location in Gilberts is a huge disappointment. 
Based off this experience I will never go back."}
{"text":"The place looks clean and nicely laid out. 

But the chicken itself had so much coating on it the pieces were unrecognizable.  Is it a thigh ? A drumstick ?  I'm sure some people like the deep fried delicious coating but this was way over the top coating for me. Had the livers and the gizzards too, but they too were an unrecognizable blob of something.  Once you mined your way down into the actual chicken meat it was ok. Nothing great, but not bad either 

The order takers didn't seem to know the menu yet, but they were certainly hustling.  Unfortunately they were all waiting on the cook - yes it looked like there was only one guy back there - so things were slow and backed up. 

No reason to really go back."}
{"text":"Thought we would give the new guy a try. Just wanted a simple couple pieces of chicken. Tried the tenders and there was nothing tender about them. How do you make chewy fried chicken? Specifically asked about the iced tea to confirm it was not sweet tea.. headed down the road and took a nice big swig of what turned out to be sweet tea so sweet In fact hat my teeth hurt drinking it. Oh well I guess I gotta stick with The chicken store that is closed on Sundays"}
{"text":"Barf...chicken is flavorless, fries are so so. Save time and your money and go to somewhere else. Granted I went when they were just open but I couldn't see the food getting any better ever.  Whomever bought into this franchise was grossly misinformed and should have bought a McDonald's. But it does have a great location and other people will realise how horrible this place is and it will close in about 6 months or so from opening. Go eat dirt from the creek next to the store and you will have not waisted your money or time. 

Where is the zero stars?"}
{"text":"Gross!!! Tastes like the chicken tenders were par cooked and then they just gave them to us that way. Seemed like gross slimy chicken tenders and the breadjng was not crispy at all!!! Unlike their near by competitor!!!"}
{"text":"Service is fast and friendly most of the time. There's some inconsistency from time to time for us . Sometime the food is great and then sometime it's overcook but overall it's good. This is the only place that serves the chicken liver and gizzard so we always eat here at least once a week"}
{"text":"Quick and precise service. So the staff was on top of things. The chicken is nothing special. The mashed potatoes are no better than any other fried chicken place instant and blah. I had a breast and a thigh. The breast was meaty the thigh was not. The sweet tea which I love was nasty. I'm not sure if it was the Glendale ice or water but it was gross. A plus is they sell livers and gizzards. Those were good but the breading was hard. The only reason I'm giving them 3 stars is because the staff was on top of things."}
{"text":"Great fast food. One of the only places where you can have chicken liver deep fried. If you like chicken liver that's definitely the place to go. Chicken tenders are also good and the mash potatoes with gravy amazing."}
{"text":"1st time in.  Greeted by everyone upon entering.  Place was pretty empty except for 3 people.  Food was good, nothing special or extraordinary.  The chicken was basic chicken, no special seasonings or spice to it.  The thing that put me off the most was the fact that the Manager (grey hair, goatee) 
was very attentive to one couple.  Asking how their meal was, if they needed anything else and chatting them up, but never asked us anything or inquired about our meal.  He was even giving them directions on the application of the spices on the table to their tenders.  Because the chicken was regular fried chicken, I will likely stick to Raising Cane's.  Their service is always consistent and I leave feeling like my patronage is valued.  This place is new and issues with wait times or food consistency is expected, but most places at least thank you or ask about the visit or the meal, especially when you go to the extreme for other customers.  Consistency."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed.... Very unorganized and chaotic behind the counter (overstaffed). Arrived? just before 7pm. Ordered gizzards and livers, one of my favorites. Sat down to enjoy them. Did I say... Sadly disappointed? Coating was very bland .... gizzards we're very tough and chewy, livers were dried and crunchy. Maybe it was time to make some fresh ones. The root beer was cold and satisfying & rolls were excellent."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad, but I've bad better. The chicken was kind of dry and everything kind of tasted bland (mashed potatoes, etc.) The little packets of seasoning are kind of fun to put on your chicken, I would probably give it another chance it'll just be awhile"}
{"text":"Really good customer service, damn good chicken, and the I was going to say hi to my friends and I was just going to go to get a pizza and then I'll I get a pizza and then I will go back again soon and get I got a good pizza and a good place for you guys and I would love it if I had pizza and I would definitely come back again soon I would love to come back again and get some good food and soon I get to see what I you can do for you sure will get it to go back to get it back again and get a good call from a good friend and a good night to go back again soon and I get nasty chicken."}
{"text":"Fast service and super friendly staff! Very clean restaurant. The food was great! I prefer the chicken strips from Bush's over KFC or Raising Canes. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried them for the first time, two piece chicken meal, very good, Cole slaw excellent, nice fresh got roll, honey and good condiment selection on each table. I'd come back to try other items, some 10 sides to choose from."}
{"text":"Giving it 3.5 cause at least the food is good. The chicken tenders have a good flavor and are served with white country gravy. The gravy doesn't have much flavor though :(
Definitely do NOT do the drive through. I don't know what they were thinking but it is not efficient at all. They were short staffed and I waited quite a while before I got my food. Justin was awesome and made up for the time I had to wait."}
{"text":"very dissapointrd!   Over priced, chicken has little flavor,  points for crispy coating.   Coleslaw was so sweet I couldnt eat it.   Fries are frozen.   Chicken was dried out from sitting under heat lamps.  I will not be going back"}
{"text":"I just recently found Bush's Scottsdale location. It's so good I was shocked when I read they closed. The chicken is SO good as are the rolls. Sides not that great. WTF I hope they open another location around Scottsdale. I think the colonel sucks. This chicken was fresh and you could tell which piece you were eating! Good luck with that at kfc. 

Sad...."}
{"text":"Terrible. The staff were extremely annoyed and rude to us. The restaurant looked like it hadn't been cleaned for a day or two. The Baked Chicken they offered required 50 minutes to prepare, and it didn't state that on the menu. The fried chicken chicken we did end up ordering was bland, over cooked, and dry. Overall, do not stop here.  It is not worth your time."}
{"text":"Been watching this place go up for the better part of 6 months on my daily drive, so I took 3/4 of the family there today for their Grand Opening.  We weren't disappointed.  

The owner, Shannon, greeted us as we approached the counter and explained the menu to us, as well as the specials they offer on certain days - \"Chicken Tender Tuesday\" and \"2 pies for a buck Fridays\".  He also said coupons are being sent out to all homes in a 4 mile radius in the upcoming days, so keep your eyes out for them!

We ordered three 4-piece chicken tender meals and were not disappointed. 

The chicken is marinated before frying, and the crust comes out light and crispy.  It's less greasy and FAR MORE FLAVORFUL than Cane's.  I ordered mine with the gravy, which comes standard and is VERY GOOD.  Think light (white) and peppery, not a generic, heavy, goopy mess you often find at fast food places.  If gravy isn't your bag, you can substitute with dipping sauces. The BBQ dipping sauce was good and the jalape√±o ranch was excellent.  Still, I'll stick with the gravy next time because it's that good.

They offer an assortment of Southern sides, including green beans, corn on the cob, okra, mashed potatoes, cole slaw, mac & cheese, and jalape√±os.  For our sides, we kept it traditional and ordered fries, which were medium thickness, crispy, and perfectly seasoned.  As the first reviewer mentioned, there's a nice assortment of bottled sauces on each table, just like you might find at home. 

Also included with each meal is a fresh baked roll, pulled right off the baking sheet.  Yum!

They offer Coke products, but not Coke Zero, which is our favorite.  If we could make a request, that would be it.

If iced tea is your thing, this is the place.  Shannon explained to us that they pay more for a higher grade of tea leaves, which I believe after tasting it. The tea is available sweet, 1/2 sweet, and unsweetened.  Seriously delicious tea.  We watched them add granulated sugar to the batch of sweet tea - no syrups here!  

All drinks come with free refills, but you need to ask at the counter for more tea or you can let one of their walk-around hosts take care of it for you.

The service was noteworthy.  Lots of friendly staff, some still learning, but eager to make a positive dining experience.  They check on diners at their tables regularly and help with refills and clearing plates (yes, plates), much like the Chik-Fil-A service model. Think Southern cookin' with Southern hospitality.  We hope the owners continue to play a hands-on role with customers, as it makes you feel like you're supporting a family establishment, not a national chain. 

First days are always tough, but we had a great experience and look forward to going back."}
{"text":"I have been impressed in the past with the cheerful smiling employees. Just had an unhappy experience with a young lady with 'Assistant manager' on her shirt. Get this picture. As she walked up she was scowling.  Then she stood behind me next to the back seat window!  Even if I hadn't had a bad head/neck injury it would be very uncomfortable to turn all the way around in my seat to talk to her!  I waved and asked her to move up. Took a couple tries but she finally moved forward where I could see her. She stood there scowling. I asked if something was wrong and she just shrugged and said no.  She came back to the car twice more to give my food and then return change. Not once did she smile and not once did she say anything friendly.  I doubt this is what the owners had in mind when they asked staff to go out to cars to take orders to give us a personal touch!  ALso I sure hope this assistant manager's attitude doesn't wear off on her staff. This occurred around 330pm on 7/14/17"}
{"text":"Truly Meh...
I was there a few days ago and it was disappointing, chicken had no seasoning, even the batter had no flavor. The macaroni and cheese tasted exactly like KFC mac n cheese. The only redeeming thing was the chicken gizzards.
Church's chicken is better seasoned.
Sorry guys but there are much better places for the price."}
{"text":"Best chicken this side of the Mississippi. I Grew up with KFC and churches chicken. Then along came Popeye's chicken over here  with a Cajun spice. Was mighty good for a while. However, they were all over cooked and to salty, too greasy.Then I seen a post about this new outfit called Bush's Cicken coming to Gilbert. I thought it was another run of the mill, deep fried greasy chicken outfit. Needless to say, Bush's chicken does it right each and every day. Cooked to perfection, not too salty, not too greasy and super tender.
 Anyone out there that eats KFC often or any other fried chicken fast food joint.
 Please give Bushs a try and you will not be disappointed. They even have baked chicken for those who don't want the high cholesterol fried option. And believe me the baked option is Good as Gold."}
{"text":"Been to this place twice and Every time I have went the food was got and excellent and the service provided by Shakira was absolutely magnificent! Definetly will be back!! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"beware of the worst manager and rude one the don't need to be in business  the need to go back to Texas where they don they belong. they do not need to be here in Arizona   we have better chicken then that just to try a sample of chicken they wanted to charge 1.39 for one piece to try it they should be close down by health department  go too popeyed and lo lo chicken and waffle they are way better then this crap"}
{"text":"5 stars for fast food fried chicken. This is the standard I'm basing this off of. I used to like KFC, once in a blue moon, but lately it's so greasy and the quality isn't there. Popeyes is okay but it's hit and miss. It's tough to find a fried chicken joint that's reasonably priced and consistently good. 

Bush's is excellent as far as fast food fried chicken goes. First the batter is not overly salted or seasoned. It's crispy and flaky without being so greasy. After KFC I feel like I have to drink a gallon of water later to deal with the sodium overdose. Some might not like the lack of salt on this chicken if you're used to other fried chicken places that overdo it and will criticize Bush's for lack of flavor. But with Bush's you really get a nice tasting piece of chicken. There's something to their chicken not being overly seasoned that lends itself nicely to adding hot sauces, or honey, or country gravy and still having great flavor, without being overpowered by spices and salt. 

I've been here about 3-4 times now and each time it grows on me more and more and is becoming my favorite chicken place. 

The other thing I like is they're not stingy on the size of their chicken pieces. You go to a place like KFC. You get to choose between breast and a wing, or leg and thigh, something like this. Here it says \"2 pc or 3pc meal\" and you pick what pieces you want. You can do 2 breasts if you want. 2 thighs, etc. 

I will say too, my kids and wife like it too. My wife doesn't like fried foods and my kids are hit and miss with it, but they all like this place. If I suggest any other fried chicken place, my wife says \"no\" or offers for me to order for myself and she'll eat something else. But she likes Bush's. While they do have chicken tenders as a boneless option, my kids (8 and 5) will actually order chicken off the bone here. They like it a lot. Usually they always want the boneless options at other places. 

Another bonus is their side items. Fried okra, white country gravy are among the sides that give this place a different twist. You can also order chicken livers and gizzards. Never tried that, kinda afraid to, but it's an interesting thing that shows that they're cooking up other parts of the chicken and Little is going to waste of our delicious feathered friends. 

The rolls are a nice change from the typical salty and greasy biscuit that other places always have. They do some pretty good specials too, like tender Tuesdays where you can fead your family at a pretty reasonable price. 

I'd say put your sodium overloaded expectations aside and give this place a try. You'll get crunchy, less greasy chicken and pieces that are generous in size. Staff is always friendly and willing to make suggestions if you have a hard time deciding. Hats off to this place."}
{"text":"Didn't like thisd chickjen at all. I only gave it one star because this site wouldn't let me give a review unless I have at least one but it deserves no stars."}
{"text":"Went to Bush's Chicken for the first time with high hopes, but was a bit disappointed. The chicken was very chewy and tasted like low quality meat. Also, the French frys seem to have not been salted at all. Finally, the sweet tea tasted like it was made with unfiltered water and had a bitter after taste. Overall everything came out very bland and unseasoned, definitely not what I expected."}
{"text":"First visit to this new chix chain... The Kernel and Popeye's has them beat and some of the supermarkets... Just sayin...Chicken and sides were just ok. Service was a cluster mess. Why they took our order at the counter on Memo pad instead of the touch screen gave me an indication this wasn't going to be good. I was right... Bad idea. Our meal was delayed. Why?  What intrigue us about this place was the Fried Chicken livers... horrible dry, over cooked, and were not made to order. Who knows how long they were sitting under the heat lamp... You won't see us again... to many other better choices."}
{"text":"Clean establishment, the employees were really nice. The chicken honestly is pretty plain nothing special at all. Really crisp but no taste except the grease on the skin. Potatos and gravy pretty simple. Sweet tea was actually really good. I give it a 3 just for the bare minimum that it is chicken. If you want fast food chicken go to KFC for a better product. If you need in and out this place will do."}
{"text":"Bush's chicken should have stayed in texas, stopped in for my first try and it was below average from the instant potatoes to the flavorless gravy, the buns were like the ones at frys bakery area and the chicken was nothing special at all, worst I remember eating so far, mediocre cafeteria food!! 1.5 stars max"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Food was very salty and not hot at all I would say room temperature. There is so many better places out there. Also didn't appreciate that I had to pay for BBQ sauce. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to like it, place looked clean and well staffed. Ordered in the drive thru, and that is where the trouble began. While we were waiting for our food we watched a female staff member stick her hand (un gloved) into my soda to \"push the ice down?\" And then while the food was being prepared we watched her dig through the ice box and play with the ice with her bare hands. 
I told a man, who I tried to guess was the manager and I saw him speak with her and then saw her empty the top layer of the ice and go on with her work. Nothing more was said to us, we were brought our food. Paid for
It. And we left.. 
I was actually too grossed out to even eat... boo"}
{"text":"Not familiar with TX fried chicken but can tell you I am not impressed with it either. I would take Churches chicken any day over Bush's.  I wanted to taste the chicken liver. It had so much crust on it you could hardly find which was liver and which was gizzard.  Went inside for the order and they still got the order wrong.  Did not care for the ranch dressing nor the white peppery gravy. Ended up using honey.  There was no seasoning on the chicken leg, they give you packets of salt and pepper.  How do you add that through all the thick hard crust on the chicken? Not impressed and will probably not return."}
{"text":"We recently moved from Tx, and one of the restaurants we had missed very much was Bushes Chicken, imagine our surprise when we saw one was being built close to our home in Chandler Az. We visited it tonight, and we were in heaven. Same great flavor as the Bushes restaurants  in San Antonio  and they also had very friendly staff. Will keep going back."}
{"text":"Went to this new restaurant over the weekend and in my mind, it's better than KFC and Church's, the chicken is moist and flavorful and the rolls are awesome. Will definitely patronize them again."}
{"text":"This place serves great chicken,Tenders, gravy is a plus and the buns are delish. The seasoning packets to sprinkle on the chicken are very tasty. Not only that but I Always get kind and friendly service.. I prefer this over Cain's any day."}
{"text":"They have my three favorite f's: fast, friendly and fresh. 

KFC should close their doors now because fried chicken doesn't get any better. From the delicious roll to the white gravy, they are both almost as good as the perfectly crunchy and moist fried chicken. I'm so happy we stopped in, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The young staff is extremely unprofessional and under-managed. It was like watching cats be herded while using hands to grab food and place on plates. The food was too salty. The chicken livers were good but the fried chicken not so much. I'm a southerner and really wanted this place to be good."}
{"text":"If you like country gravy you will love this place. Great combo with the tenders and gravy. Huge downside if the drive thru! They have a horrible system and never enough people working. I waited 30 mins on a few occasions and had cars who arrived after me getting food first. When I asked why I was waiting so long I was told she was helping someone else and the other people took the tenders for my order before she could grab them. I'm shouldn't they fill orders in order not just who gets there first? They should also take payment when you order rather than delivering food then making another trip. 

***update***The tenders were always on the small side and they would get tough but tonight they were huge and super juicy! I hope they stay this way because they were so good."}
{"text":"Waited in line inside for over twenty minutes as the one cashier helped two people.  Line behind me was close to ten groups.   No sense of urgency from hourly staff at all.    It will ensure i never go back no matter what the food taste like"}
{"text":"Better than Kane's and KFC.  TENDERS are better than pieces.  Sweet tea and sides are very good.  The rolls are BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't overly impressed, but wasn't disappointed.  Tenders were crispy and gravy was good.  Would have preferred a little more flavor or spice in the tenders.  Perhaps have a Cajun tender option but I get that it's a national chain and they have to stick with what works."}
{"text":"The Gm David was spot on, professional, polite and wanted my business. I just left Popeye's chicken with my family ready to spend 40-50 bucks and simply ask for freshly cooked chicken and was denied, so I left! Took my family to Bush's chicken and asked for the same request and got a yes quickly. The Gm David knows the meaning of running a business. Thank you David and to all your polite employees."}
{"text":"Food is yummy but the people taking orders are forgetful when giving you the food you just bought. There was no line. Rush was over and I order the poppers as my side. Cashier said it would take a couple of minutes. 10 minutes later I checked on my order and the poppers were sitting there next to the fries. The same guy who took my order forgot he never gave me my food. 

Chicken was great and the gravy tasted good with the bread roll and chicken. 

I will probably come back in a month to give them another chance. 

Sweet Tea is not as strong tasting as I'm used to drinking."}
{"text":"The chicken here was very mediocre. The staff was young and untrained. I will not be going back to this location or to any of their other establishment. I will stick to Church's Chicken. But I do like the crushed ice"}
{"text":"Bland chicken and breading. Cant speak to the chicken pieces, but i imagine they wouldnt be much different. Light on the chicken tender proportions but give you a ton of gravy??? For what??? The variety of sides is cool, but even the sides were meh. Just go to Canes down the road."}
{"text":"Chicken strips are great not as large as canes but very good.. They have okra!! I am so happy!! Lots of people working came in during a slow spell so manager seemed busy giving lots of direction.  Food was good, hot, fresh and the cashier was great explained the menu made recommendations.  I will be back to try the chicken!"}
{"text":"I went here last night for the first time because I have a few friends that swear it is the best chicken.  So I figured why not, even bad fried chicken is still good.  Well, that usually is true, unless it is not cooked all the way.  I wouldn't have even written a review had the manager on duty not been defensive when I pointed out the tenders that were pink and/or slimy.  Instead of saying I am sorry, can i get you a new batch for you, the response was, \"that is our marinade and it makes the chicken look like that\".  Now i am not an expert when it comes to chicken and will never claim to be, but there is one thing I know, chicken is either white throughout or not cooked.  And a marinade would never give a slimy gel look to a product that is fried.  I worked at Chick-fil-a for 3 years, so I know enough about chicken to know that at least.  A simple, I am sorry instead of blaming the marinade would have been fine.  I get it, restaurants screw up, it is bound to happen, but own the mistake, don't push the blame back onto the customer for not being used to chicken looking shiny and pink as being ready for consumption, which it isn't.  I did get a refund and took that money to Raising Cane's where the Chicken was white on the inside."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh chicken, we used the drive-thru, where a order person actually comes out to your car takes your order, which is kind of more personal I think.
Staff is friendly and we love the food, we are so glad that this chicken place moved into our neighborhood, yummy mac and cheese, jalapeno poppers and french fries were among our sides, they also have very good iced tea according to my husband, who loves his unsweetened tea. We will be regulars at this new hotspot."}
{"text":"Went today for the first time and it was alright... The place looked pretty clean! There was only about 4-5 employees working and it was awkwardly not busy.. They did have an in-store student deal for 3 chicken tenders, gravy, roll, side & a large drink for $5.99 so that was really nice! The gravy, roll & French fries were pretty yummy but I personally thought the chicken had no flavor. It was not wrongly cooked but it just seemed to have no seasoning or flavoring to me. I probably will give this place another try sometime in the future but it's definitely not a horrible place but not the greatest either!"}
{"text":"Good ordering experience.  

Friendly and efficient staff.

I ordered the family meal of fried chicken.  The chicken was very good.

The  greenbeans were very good.

The mac-n-cheese was flavorless."}
{"text":"I've had this before in another state and when I realized that it was coming here I got very excited! I told my girlfriend we had to go, and she usually only likes canes! So I took her here and it blew her away and she said that I was right and that it is way better! This place is one of my favorites, the chicken is fantastic and so is the country gravy! Everything is always good and staff is friendly"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place since it finally opened. The staff was great and nice. Place was kinda clean. The chicken looked good but once I tried it I found it to lack quite a bit of flavor and honestly would have just enjoyed going to KFC. Most likely won't be back again. Would rather spend 20$ at KFC and get flavor."}
{"text":"Feel/Look-  I'll be honest the inside of Bush's Chicken kind of bummed me out. The colors are all muted and bland. Everything from the tables to the \"rest home beige\" disposable plates seem right out of a TV sitcom mocking frumpy fast food restaurants. Its also worth mentioning that the staff although seemingly well intentioned was a little scattered and unmanaged.

Taste- the chicken is very generic. I would have a hard time picking it out of a lineup of fried chicken from the frozen food aisle. Meals do come with a side of grave and that excited a gravy fan like me but unfortunately it's nothing to write home about.

Pros- they serve fried chicken and gravy
Cons- they don't do it very well"}
{"text":"Not thrilled at all!  Cole slaw was good.  Chicken too chewy, in flavor.  Won't go back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place closed.
The staff was always so nice and professional and the food was always well prepared and at a decent price.

It's honestly very sad that this place didn't catch on in Scottsdale. I always enjoyed my experience here.

My family and I went on the first day they opened, and many times after that.

This place will be very missed."}
{"text":"This place just opened up so i thought I'd give it a try. I went through the drive thru and ordered the 4 piece tender meal with fried Okra. The service was spot on and quick, but the food not so much. Just tasted like typical fast food. Maybe I went in with too high of expectations."}
{"text":"Bush's Chicken is amazing! We've been here twice now and I can't say enough great things about this place. The food is great, best deals for family meals and the hospitality is great. We had the opportunity of meeting the actual owner and he greeted me and my family and had a full on conversation with us along with one of the managers. This place was packed the moment we walked that says something. I highly recommend this place if your looking for some great cooking, something different to try other than your typical chicken chains and if you're also looking for some great southern hospitality from Texas."}
{"text":"The place was so unorganized and the manager was full of excuses. Took 15 minutes to tak our order and there was only one person in front of us. The manager seemed so lost. Out of everyone waiting, only one person was helping anyone. I don't want to rate the good for this place because the service, management skills, and organization will kill this company. And I am writing this at the cash register, they just messed up my simple order."}
{"text":"The chicken strips are juice and perfectly fried. The dinner rolls are fluffy and warm. The coleslaw taste great!"}
{"text":"Chicken tenders were juicy.  The roll was sweet and yummy.  The gravy was delish.  I loved the fried okra.  I'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I am so mad. I never leave reviews on yelp but I just had to tonight. The general manager leaves a lot to be desired. I went through the drive through (no speaker they walk out and take your order.) then they bring the food then take your money and have to come back to bring your card to you. 

Tonight I ordered $30 worth of food. As I started to drive away I realized they didn't ask me about sauce for the strips. I park and go inside to see what sauces they have. The GM butts in and says \"had I known you wanted sauce I could have traded it for that large gravy\".  I said I just need a couple sauces. He said \"well I'll do it this time for free but..\" I was so frustrated by this time I said \"forget it. I just wanted a couple. I won't be back\". They lost a customer for life over the fact that for a 20 piece strip meal I asked for two sauces and you would have thought I was breaking the bank for their .10 sauce. I was willing to pay for them but he acted as though I asked for something out of the ordinary. Not everyone likes gravy, esp white gravy. It was fine for the potatoes. However I didn't know they gave you a large tub of it. We only used the small one that came with the potatoes. The poppers tasted dirty too. I won't be back. Next time I'll go through the light and get Raising Canes chicken. 

Poor customer service."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter if the chickens any good if you can't get it. I waited in line 10 minutes and no one ever came to the counter to take my order I finally gave up went outside got in my car drove around at the drive-thru and I waited eight minutes there before someone bothered to come out and ask me if I have been helped yet. I said I hadn't and then they went and helped the car next to me in the other lane. Really?  I drove background parks and went inside to try to complain to a manager he's too busy cooking chicken one girl's work in the counter I hear her tell the guy in front of me that it's going to be 10 minutes till chickens ready I gave up and went to Popeye's. Their customer service system is a joke. Their drive-thru system is ridiculous. A guy has to come out and take your order then go back in and put in the order then he comes back out to give you your order and you give him the money then he has to go back in and get your change and then he comes back outside to give you your change then he goes back inside instead of helping the guy next in line. Hello drive-thrus have Windows now. Point of sale systems have wireless tablets.You can go right to the customer and put in the order wirelessly then process the money at the same time... instead of going back and forth 3 times. I was at the store for 15 minutes waiting for someone to take my order and no one ever did.  You lose.. I lose. I never could get a manager to complain to."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait for this Bush's to open and ended up being very disappointed. Chicken tasted old, and the ordering system was a little odd. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"They have delicious and more than reasonably priced chicken. Great service too! They always say hi when you walk in (all of them). like their chicken tenders! The food portions are huge! I highly recommend. My friend and I like to joke and say that this is a fancier and better version of KFC. Good hot sauces too! Don't forget about tender Tuesdays!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst meal I have eaten in a long time. The chicken tastes as it had about a pound of salt, at first it tasted fine but after the first strip it was downhill. The mashed potatoes taste like ground cardboard and the Mac n cheese tastes like solidified vegetable oil on macaroni. I never review things but this was so beyond disgusting the I was compelled to do so.

Update: We gave the chicken to our dog and she wouldn't eat more after eating one chunk of the chicken. Just so you know this dog devours our Baby's poopy diapers when we accidentally leave then down."}
{"text":"When Bushs originally opened, we absolutely loved i and we weren't the only ones! The entire staff was super friendly and the food was amazing! There the only place around with good fried liver and gizzards, their chicken strip were amazing, the sides were spectacular, and the sauces were rocking! 
Now it seems like the employees don't care about their customers, let alone their jobs. The chicken is all breading and over cooked now, the sweet tea tastes like it's been sitting in there for days, they completely changed the sauces, and the liver is chewy. Honestly, we believe it all started going downhill when Franklin was no longer there on a permanent basis. 
Bring back Franklin and the good Bushs will come back, otherwise the future of this business doesn't look bright."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. Clean lobby, friendly staff. Fair prices. Good Chicken. I had the Manager's special, Chicken breast, a wing, roll, one side and a large drink - $ 5.50"}
{"text":"The staff is kind and helpful, the place is very clean and roomie. I'm giving it three stars because the food was \"eh\". The crunch was good, but I was waiting for something more in the flavor. It was bland and the chicken was toughish. The Mac and cheese needed more flavor as well, something that not just salt and pepper  could fix.  The Apple pie is fried (which I like) but same thing , bland, it also seemed stale. Overall, this place(as far as food) is kinda like a bad movie; you stick you around because you think it will get better,  but it doesn't  and then it's over and now you can't get your money back."}
{"text":"So this chicken and a few employees were imported from Texas. Just because chicken is from Texas doesn't make it better than chicken from Kentucky. In terms of tenders, Canes has got them beat by a country mile - no competition. In terms of chicken breast on the bone, it is nowhere near LOLOs quality and probably falls just below Popeyes. Decent crunchy exterior and meaty, but not greasy.
  Go with the mashed potatoes as your side. Rolls are unique, but nothing special, but the gravy dipping sauce is salty, but yet creamy.
Oh and all that gizzards crap should have stayed in Texas."}
{"text":"We went to Bush's Chicken to get some late night chicken after returning from an out of town trip. Although we had had some trouble with this Bush's restaurant in the past, we decided we would give them another try. We were glad to see that fresh chicken had been put out, as we had sometimes gotten chicken that was cold, hard, and not fresh in the past. There was no line, but there one man was there to order some condiments after receiving his food order. The worker at the counter paid solicitous attention to this customer while not even acknowledging our existence.  The woman behind the counter also was busy doing other things as well, perhaps working on drive through orders, but she ignored us completely also. After about 10 minutes we decided to walk out. A simple \"We will be with you in a little while, after we take care of these customers\" might have been sufficient to keep us in the restaurant, but it was not forthcoming. After we started to walk off, the woman told us she was ready to take our order, and seemed offended that we were leaving, claiming that she had to finish other orders before she got to us. We understood that, of course, but a restaurant with a shred of courtesy and professionalism will at least acknowledge customers even if those customers have to wait. Also we had to just stand at the counter all that time. A courteous restaurant worker would have told us that we could sit down while we waited, and they would inform us when they were ready to serve us. This rude staff didn't do that either. Instead, when we were about to leave, they then acted as if we were doing something wrong by walking out even though they said they were ready to serve us. One more polite female worker, who was sweeping the lobby, offered to put our order in, but we had experienced too much rudeness at that point to place our order by then. 
I don't know what training workers at this restaurant are given, but we got far better and more polite service from McDonald's drive-thru that morning than we got here, by an enormous margin. I strongly un-recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had heard about this new chicken joint from my brother in law, but wanted to let the newness wear off before giving it a try.  Was not disappointed.  Place was busy, but service was fast and accurate.  Ordered 4 tenders, 6 livers, mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans and coleslaw.  Chicken was crispy, tender and moist.  Batter was almost tempura like. Livers were melt in your mouth.  Found the sides to be superior to other chicken places and slightly larger portions.  The yeast rolls were tasty as well.  Only disappointment was they served a whipped margarine instead of butter, and packaged lemon juice instead of real lemon slices.  Didn't try the dipping sauces, due to the fact that if you have good gravy, and they do, you don't need anything else.  Bush's is now my go to choice for fired chicken."}
{"text":"Honestly, truly, the worst fried chicken I have had in my life. I would much rather have grocery store chicken than this any day, better and cheaper! So disappointed that I threw 30 dollars away. We ended up trashing most of the chicken. The mac and cheese was inedible, no salt, noodles falling apart, and had a faint chemical taste. The green beans tasted canned, but like the low sodium canned, no flavor at all and mushy. The ONLY, and I do mean ONLY good thing was the rolls, but they're pretty much just King's Hawaiian. Will never go here again. Take heed, don't waste your money like me!"}
{"text":"The chicken was delicious! I have never been a huge fan of Canes because I feel like it is very heavy. We ordered chicken tenders with Friend Okra. The tenders are very light and crispy honestly best tenders I have had. The Sweet tea reminds me of McDonald's sweet tea but it with a more natural taste. The rolls are nothing like I imagined whey would be but they are delicious. The service was speedy and courteous. 5 stars"}
{"text":"This place is at least 4 stars maybe 5. Chicken was hot and crispy  Gravy is delicious.  Staff was knowledgeable,  fast, and friendly. Rolls were fresh. Sides were great. I got mac and cheese and green beans. I will definitely make this my goto fried chicken plsce."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try Bush's a new chicken spot in town. I quickly regretted our decision. The chicken was unappealingly bland. Hands down the Mac and cheese were the worst. They reminded me of what I use to eat while visiting my grandparents in the senior home. Even after adding a ton of salt and pepper it still didn't get better. There was no hope for what they called Mac and cheese. While I forced the unpleasant food in my mouth I daydreamed about horrible mistake I made and all the other places I'd rather have dined at."}
{"text":"The service was speedy and the drive thru was convenient, but overall the food did not meet my expectations.  I enjoyed the chicken and the gravy, but the rolls were very dry and the sides were too bland."}
{"text":"I also such a picky chicken eater and I was afraid to try them due to the Yelp stars. But then I thought why not try once. Their food is awesome. I was so impressed with the chicken strips and being able to buy fried chicken breast separately because I can't stand the wing and thigh. Their rolls are awesome with the honey packets. Gravy is so good. Totally worth trying! Price were great too."}
{"text":"This was my and the misses first visit to this new establishment, and we were impressed with the quality and the quantity of our meals. The bone in chicken was moist and crispy. And get this you get to choose which pieces you want, with no up charge, I got a gigantic breast and a thigh. 

The fried okra, cheddar jalapeno poppers and chicken tenders were freshly fried, hot and crispy!  The gravy was hot and a good addition to the tenders; that was a new thing for us with chicken tenders, we liked it for another dipping sauce option it was good with the okra and our sweet roll too. 

The sweet tea was sweet and cold, just the way I like it. 

The only negatives, they don't sell their Bush's sauce in Az, bummer and our awesome looking sweet rolls came out of the heater and they were cold.   which I guess didn't end up mattering in the end because we were too full to eat them. 

The on duty manager was super friendly and explained the menu and concept to us as it is just a tad different then all of the other chicken joint options available in the Gilbert area. 

He even let us have a free sample of the gizzards and livers with a side of gravy. The gizzards will keep you alive if you have no other options, but they are more of a nostalgic option for those people that grew up eating them.   

The livers were crispy and livery.  I grew up eating liver and onion night once a month and these were 100 times better, but again these are more of a novelty item. 

We will be back and next time will will be bringing our boys and great grandma."}
{"text":"Ok, was not expecting a lot because it's another chicken place! Saying that I was ready for disappointment! Not as bad as I thought but not great either! The chicken was crispy, which I really like but so greasy! But the French fries were awful, not even brown! They did have lots of sides, hubby got fried okra, (kind of hard to mess that one up, as it the same most places) you have to ask for the ice tea, it's not out and available! My pluses were honey on the table, but our bear was empty, looking around most were! Probably won't be making a second visit, but was hopeful it would be a go to place! The rolls were good but do not come with butter! It was not busy at lunch time so I guess many have tried and came to the same conclusion as me!"}
{"text":"I don't like seeing these teenagers out in 115 degree weather... the employees were so sweet but nothing special about the food."}
{"text":"Place looked great and service was good. The chicken was a bit like rubber. Kind of chewy and had a snap to it when you chewed it. Chicken should not have a snap to it when you chew it in my opinion. It's hard to explain. It just had a bit of a calamari quality to it but much easier to chew.  I'm not sure if this is the norm at Bush's since this was my first time here, but nonetheless it wasn't my favorite. The sides were good but not good enough to bring me back. It's pretty pricey too. I would definitely go to Cane's instead next time for chicken strips because it tastes much better and although the prices are similar, they give you so much more food at Cane's."}
{"text":"Not at all impressive. Churches, KFC, Popeyes all have distinctive flavor and style. This tasted old, precooked and bland. What was good? The spice they put on the table and the rolls have a good flavor and seemed fresh. You don't really need to.try it. Stick to what's good for you. I should mention the staff was excellent and the place clean."}
{"text":"Can only rate the service since never actually got food. Wanted some friend chicken for dinner, so decided to try bushes. Pull into drivethrough, and it said 2 lanes so pulled into the 2nd lane. No ordering kiosk like most places, so just sat there, along with a lot of other people. After about 15 minutes, of the servers just passing us by and only serving the one lane, got annoyed and went inside to order. Got up to counter after it took ~5 minutes just for one person to order. Order a 10 piece chicken with 2 sides family pack, and then I'm told they don't have any chicken ready, it will be 15+ minutes to cook chicken. WTF? It is a chicken place, with no chicken. All they had was the strips, but we didn't want strips. Manager offered no solution, apologized that his drive through was not working as it should, and gave me no option but to drive one street down to popeyes and enjoy a quick easy drive through experience with no issues."}
{"text":"It was just ok....it wasn't great but it was not bad. We grabbed some chicken tender combo meals to go tonight to finally try this place out. The batter was heavy and the chicken was a little bit on the dry side but it wasn't bad. It reminded me a lot of the tenders at Church's. The mashed potatoes come with white gravy which isn't something I am a huge fan of but again, it wasn't bad. The roll was delicious. So light and fluffy...I could have had a couple of those and skipped the mashed potatoes. 

The service was good and prices are compared to the competing chains. When ordering inside at the counter you pay when the food is ready and not when you order it which is a bit odd but not really a problem."}
{"text":"Sat in and was ignored in the \"drive through\" for 15+ minutes before someone pulled up in the 3rd (labeled exit) lane and was immediately helped.

Beyond poor customer service and attention only made worse by the lack of organization and order kiosk in the drive through. 

Standing and taking orders works great if you implement a system like in and out has, not so much if you lack any order and drive up windows for your \"drive though\". 

Won't be back and won't be recommending."}
{"text":"We just moved to this area about 5 months ago. We found this amazing Chicken place and cannot be happier! KFC can have Jesus himself as a spokesperson and NEVER compare to Bush's Chicken. The size of the pieces, the flavour, the quality and the service cannot be beaten!! Look in your junk mail for their monthly sale flyer their prices are awesome!"}
{"text":"Never have I heard of this place and just did something spontaneous and just drove in. I'm surprised and loved the service Emily was a wonderful customer server, she was funny, adorable and love her company. She helped out with our menu and she recommended a couple of stuff and she didn't lie, It WAS SO GOOD!!! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"The employees were very friendly and helpful. We had a 4 piece chicken fingers meal that comes with a large sweet roll and gravy and a 2 chicken tenders, each on a bun with mashed potatoes and gravy. We also ordered a side of coleslaw. 

Before going into the review, we should note that intend to be a really healthy eater so I'm taking into account that I'm eating food outside my normal type of eating...

The buns were large, soft and sweet with the chicken tenders being too small for the bread, in our opinion. The buttered roll itself was tasty. My husband liked the gravy (it as only meh to me but I'm not a big gravy girl). The mashed potatoes were decent but not memorable. The coleslaw was sweet and a little too runny for my flavor but again, decent. The sauces were good (we tried them all) and it's really just up to personal preference. 

All in all it was a good meal and we left full. We would've preferred more chicken in the tenders and would try different sides."}
{"text":"Love the chicken and gravy! Always fresh and way better than most chicken places I have been to"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience in all areas. The staff was friendly and helpful. The food was outstanding!! Hot, fresh and great quality for the price. Excellent selection of delicious sides. The gravy is amazing! Blows Cane's away!! We will return soon."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this restaurant. When I finally had an opportunity to try it with some of my coworkers we were very disappointed with this place. The customer service was good but very chaotic. Our order was taken by one person then another served our drinks and yet another took payment for the orders. Once the food was brought out it was clear this place is an absolute joke. The server stated to us that \" we added some extra tenders on the plate for you, they are a bit small\". Small is an absolute understatement. These tenders were very thin and the coating had absolutely no flavoring whatsoever. The gravy that accompanies the tenders also lacked in flavor and tasted more like something that was in a can and reheated. The fries I had ordered as a side were pathetic, soggy and completely over salted. Perhaps the tenders lacked in flavor because they seemed to have used all the salt on the fries. After we had all managed to eat or food, one of the employees politely asked if we were done with our trays and offered to dispose of our trash, to which we said yes. Before the employee picked up our trays he asked if we knew the \" story\" of the restaurant. We replied no. He began to tell us the story. The short version is that they were voted #1 chicken place in Texas and had beat out rival Raising Canes. At the end of the employees story he said \" That's why we built this location across the street from Raising Canes, so we can put them out of business\". Well from my experience I am going to say that this place will undoubtedly be out of business long be for Raising Canes. I will likely never return to this restaurant due to the pathetic overpriced food and the even more pathetic mentality that they are the superior chicken restaurant."}
{"text":"Love, love,love Bush's... My wife and I go here quite a bit, she always gets there chicken tenders and roll. But for me ( being from the south) it's all about the Gizzards...  Come on there hard to find.

And then there's the sweet tea, if you're taking it home you might as well get a gallon jug. I love there sweet tea but I'm diabetic and get the unsweetened and add sweet and low, still very good.

I read some reviews that talked about the batter not being dark enough, that's intentional and has a great taste and it's not greasy at all...

If you eat inside there is honey and several hot sauces on the table.

So if your by a Bush's, and hungry just give it a try you'll be glad you did..."}
{"text":"We tried it out this afternoon. They had a good manager special. A couple nice guy's working there and the food was hot and fresh. Nothing crazy good but definitely worth a trip once in a while."}
{"text":"Very good food, very good prices.  We ate in and were treated by friendly employees.  We had the chicken tenders which come with a very generous side of dipping sauce.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Well after getting it confirmed today I got food poisoning from them... what makes it worse is the food that I ordered was horrible fries so limp it was as if it was microwaved. The chicken bland and paired with a horribly soggy breading. So"}
{"text":"We had a great experience on our first visit! The gentlemen at the register were extremely friendly and great representatives of their business. The food was good and the coupon was definitely worth coming in. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food--nice and hot! Wonderfully courteous and efficient employees. Very satisfied with purchase of a dinner. All fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"My large family use to come here every Tuesday for the chicken strip special. This will no longer happen. They are now giving out golf ball size chicken pieces with their strips. I brought this to the managers attention and he gave me four more golf ball pieces to make up for it. That was insulting and you just lost eight customers in one transaction. We will also be telling everyone we know that the great deal turned into a rip-off. All you had to do was replace the four golf ball pieces for the regular strips and we would have been happy. By the way, your gravy sucks and the gizzards are too salty to eat."}
{"text":"This is our second time going to Busch's, first time was at the drive up and tonight we went in to eat. Not sure if it was the kids working tonight but everything was a bit off. Tables dirty, order off, extremely slow service. We realized we didn't pay for something we were given and went up to pay and was overcharged. Even the pieces of tenders were bizarrely small, i should have taken a picture...one was the size of maybe a quarter. Anyway we won't be back."}
{"text":"Our first and last time visit to this place, it was horrible!  We ordered the chicken strips and mashed potatoes. When got home, either got two sides of white gravy or the potatoes were just like the gravy. Either way, threw that away. The roll was just a glorified Hawaiian roll, nothing to speak off. Then on our way out from paying, we noticed raw chicken sitting behind the counter...wait until the health department finds out about this.. Lets hope we don't get sick. Chicken cannot be left out at room temperature!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok I come to Bush's quite a bit and let me tell you this. The food is incredible! They have the best chicken fingers. So crispy! Their sweet tea is off the charts! The jalape√±o ranch sauce I could seriously eat with everything! As mentioned in other posts the restaurant is not the most efficient but the employees are all very nice. It's just a small quirk to put up with to get the best dang food around! Worth the wait trust me!"}
{"text":"We finally decided to try this place and it was soooo delicious! I think a lot of people are trying to compare it to Raising Canes because it is right across the street, but it is COMPLETELY different. Its very southern style food and I liked that they had so many sides to choose from. The chicken tenders were super juicy and I liked that they served it with gravy on the side. The ordering is a little confusing, especially if you had never been here before. But we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really don't see the attraction. It was bland chicken but they give you a spice packet to sprinkle on it if you ask. Go to Canes or Popeyes if you enjoy a little flavor."}
{"text":"Tastes like Sugar Honey Iced Tea... If you know what I mean. Mac and cheese was runny and chicken tenders had an off taste to them needless to say we all had sour stomachs afterwards. Won't be back."}
{"text":"First time in, and we will be back. Juicy and crispy bone-in chicken, but the boneless was a little dry. Coming from the Midwest we miss chicken places like this. So glad to have found it."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first visit to Bush's Chicken, and it will definitely not be our last!  My husband has been searching for GOOD fried chicken, like the kind you can find in the south or back east, for decades.  We have tried a couple of southern cooking places, a chicken and waffles place, grocery store fried chicken, a few other chicken only semi-fast places, but none rated a second visit, with the possible exception of grocery store chicken if you time it right. Bush's Chicken is fresh, juicy, NOT GREASY, tasty and has the perfect blend of spices!  The sides are pretty good also, as is the iced tea.  The restaurant is clean, the staff is VERY friendly and helpful and tonight one owner walked around and spent time talking to all the guests.  They are new and I cannot expect an owner to always be there, but tonight it was a nice touch.  We will go back often to the Bush's at 73rd Ave and W Bell Rd.  I am happy that my husband will finally stop dragging me to place after place on his quest for good fried chicken!!  Thanks Bush's!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice, the chicken strips are a little on the bland side but some salt fixes that. The rolls are very good and so is the mac and cheese.  It is still way better than Church's chicken or KFC.  The chicken breast was very good and juicy.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had never been there but heard it was good. Well, for some reason we couldn't get anyone to wait on us. The cashier was either friends or family with the person in front of us and decided she needed to leave her register and personally wait on her.  Three other people were manning the drive through and also ignored us. After waiting for 10 minutes we left. It may be great chicken but their customer services leaves much to be desired!"}
{"text":"I don't get how I was informed that they are cooking more chicken and would take about 10 mins to cook the moment I walked in. I figured they just got busy and so I let it go. Fast forward to 30 mins I'm still sitting with my family waiting for our chicken. I've seen many other customers receive their food right away because they ordered smaller meals. Then when my sides came out it was totally the wrong order. Thought I'd give this place a chance but it seems like this will be my last visit here. The other comments mention the friendliness but I didn't see that whatsoever on my visit. I actually enjoyed the food but the service was just really bad."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and the price is NOT over inflated like some of the other new chicken places."}
{"text":"Throughly enjoyed their food. The guy who took our order was very friendly and nice. The mac and cheese was just a stereotypical \"mac and cheese\" from any place like McAlester's or any \"quick\" place that has mac a cheese but i love mac and cheese regardless of where it comes from. The chicken and gravy was pretty fantastic but mild. Me and my wife love spicy things and we thought it could use a kick. Sweet tea is super super sweet but just as cheap as circle K and far better. Jalape√±o poppers are deep fried jalape√±os with cheddar cheese in them and they are cooked to order, but sadly you only get 2 for $2. Overall I loved the food and anything I pick about I'm being really picky on. So I recommend trying it for sure!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Great experience. Chicken tenders were good, moist and not dry. I got the 4 piece meal which was actually reasonably priced. Came with a bunch, fries, gravy, 4chicken tenders and a drink under $10. I would give it over all 3.5"}
{"text":"It was a very interesting place. Prices wise I rather go to Popeyes or Canes. What got me was the hair in my over priced chicken tenders. The fries were eh and the roll wasn't really rolling with me. Save sometime and just go to Chick-fil-a or McDonalds."}
{"text":"I was craving chicken livers of all things and decided to finally give this place a try. It was a very busy Friday night as someone in drivethru had ordered like 40 chicken tenders and it threw everyone off.  After I walked in , I did notice that there was a ton of chicken that was already cooked and like a few other people stated, I too wondered how long it had been sitting there. However I will say that after being there for awhile, it appeared the chicken was not sitting there very long as it was disappearing very quickly. 

My order was taken by the general manager and he greeted me with a huge smile, even though they were scrambling because they were so busy. I ordered the 8 piece chicken liver meal with a roll and he apologized as it was going to be at least 2 mins before I would get my food as the livers still had a minute left to cook. All I could think was, yes I am getting hot, fresh chicken livers lol.  I will say they were pretty good, however I would have loved if they were fried maybe a minute longer. I am not a fan of the gravy that came with my order but the roll was also really good. I will eventually venture back and try their chicken one day, but at least I know I have a spot to go to if I am ever craving chicken livers."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday.  It was great!  The chicken pieces were tasty, juicy and a nice crunchy coating.  The side I had was fried okra which was tasty, moist and a good crunchy coating.  The help there was very accomodating......even giving us a taste of their mashed potatoes before ordering.  Those were delicious too, well spiced and not too salty."}
{"text":"OMG this place was so yummy  
The chicken is hot and fresh, the rolls were light and fluffy, the gravy is to die for!!! Reminds me of Oklahoma The staff was friendly and charming. The sit down was clean and well kept... Will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"Service was unique, friendly and fast.  Meeting you at car and taking order.  Chicken was good and hot.  Ice tea was cold and refreshing.  Will definitely return for some of their other offerings like the livers or Tuesday meal deal."}
{"text":"First time I ate there it was great. Now it's just so-so and they don't have corn on the cob anymore which was really good. Time to return to KFC"}
{"text":"Fried chicken livers.  I  remember seeing these when I have traveled through the South in the past, but I have never eaten them.  My first try of them was on a recent trip to AZ when I met up with buds who live in Peoria who wanted to introduce me to Bush's Chicken.  This fast food chicken chain, which is based out of Waco, TX, recently opened their first store in AZ in March, which is this store in Glendale. 

In CA,  we have Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers opening all over Southern CA and I have tried them back home in South Orange County .  There was one very close to this Bush's just right down the street, too. Both places have chicken strips. I would say the comparisons stop there. I  ordered a chicken strips combo at Bush's. I was excited to learn here you have FOUR Dipping sauce options as opposed to the other place's lame one.  I was so thrilled with this option, I purchased all four said sauces as they were just one buck for the four. I enjoyed my fried chicken strips here. I liked the jalape√±o ranch the best of the four dipping sauces to also include regular ranch, BBQ and honey mustard. The chicken was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. I liked the fact that there are many side options on your combo like green beans, okra, baked beans, pepper poppers, corn on the cob, mashed potatoes and so on. I chose the mac and cheese. This was standard mac. Not bad, not fantastic.  I really liked the roll and country gravy though that came with the combo. Not only did I dunk my roll in this tasty gravy but I dunked my chicken in it, too.  My friends ordered the chicken livers and gave me some to try. I liked these even better than my chicken tenders.  These probably aren't for everyone,  but I do enjoy foie gras, pate, liverwurst, so I knew in the deep fried form, I would probably enjoy the chicken livers here, and I did.  I would  order these next time, for sure. In my opinion, they are more flavorful than the tenders and a really excellent source of iron, too ;) I am an iced tea and sweet tea fan. They have both at Bush's.  You can even do half and half here which was cool and I went for that.  This is great, to get some sweet but not too much in your tea.

Workers were still in opening mode kind of newness while we were here, but were really super friendly and very earnest. Every staff member we came into contact with when dining inside were very nice. All in all, I enjoyed our meal here. I hope Bush's decides to expand even further West in the future and come out to Southern CA, hint, hint :)"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place since I have been watching them build it for months. Went through the drive through to place my order and I should have know from the chaos that the trip was going to be a disaster. Took close to 10 minutes until sometime can to my car, at that point the employee had to excuse herself because the person in front of me was never helped. It was 115 degrees out and the employees were literally running around, like chickens with their heads cut off. The employees were friendly and were apologizing every time they came to my window. 

I was very disappointed that the only thing that was not fried was the baked chicken salad. I decided to try that and my boyfriend got the chicken breast combo. I emphasized to the lady multiple times that I wanted the chicken baked and not fried. 

When she brought the food there was fried chicken in the salad. She explained that there was also baked chicken on the side. The baked and fried chicken for the salad was ice cold and soggy. It tasted like it had been made days before and was sitting in a cooler. The lettuce was pathetic, with no green leaves only iceberg. There was a cup of croutons and cheese on the side as well. The amount of crouton or cheese was larger than the portion or baked chicken? Also the salad itself was extremely small. It was the size of a side salad at most Drive through restaurants. I paid close to $7 for this disgusting salad. I've had better quality salads from gas stations. 

Won't be visiting here again."}
{"text":"I love the chicken gizzards from this  place when they are fresh and hot. You have to make sure you watch them as they will try to cheat you on your order... The sweet rolls are good will they are not over cooked. The mashed potatoes are my favorite as well I don't like county gravy, wish they offered brown gravy... but I can't ask for everything."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant a \"0\" but their rolls are very good. The chicken is very, very bland, the sweet tea is too strong, the gizzards were overcooked and they were out of the chicken livers.  There is also this very bland, weird white gravy that was tasteless  that comes with the combos. The chicken is extremely greasy as well. This place needs to get its act together or close. It puts southern food to shame."}
{"text":"We were their Aug. 1.  The chicken tenders the French fried roll and creamy gravy was the best we ever tasted.  Even though its a little further away, well be back for more. Tasty,tasty food."}
{"text":"I waited in line on Sunday.  They are out of chicken, out of cole slaw, the kid behind the counter took my money then wiped the side of my mashed potatoes with his bare finger..... this place needs a little management intervention."}
{"text":"These people do it RIGHT. Not only is the chicken  Absolutley fantastic, The people greet you immediately they are beyond friendly, And are extremely helpful with the menu. 

The gravy that comes with the meal  Is completely a delectable delight. I don't think I could even make a better gravy then what they serve. 

I believe I have found my new most favorite placed to dine here in The Valley."}
{"text":"Stopped by the new Gilbert location of Bush's Chicken to try some good ol' Texas Fried Chicken.

I was greeted by the friendly staff the moment I walked in which made a good first impression. I had a great conversation with the manager, who hails from San Antonio, (Hook 'em Babee!) is up here to help launch the two locations (the other is up in Glendale) of Bush's Chicken outside of the Great State of Texas.

I ordered a two piece (breast & drumstick) chicken and roll and an ice water w/ lemon. I'll tell you what, that chicken was fresh, hot (burned my dang tongue!) and juicy! The roll was fresh and had good flavor.  I took a nice chunk of the breast portion and made an impromptu chicken sandwich which was very tasty.

As I was enjoying my meal, I gazed around the restaurant and was impressed by the cleanliness and well lit interior. I even enjoyed watching a portion of a Kentucky (too bad it wasn't my Longhorns)  college football spring game on the flat screen TV they had installed up on the south wall. Fried chicken and football really compliment each other oh so well! Lol! Anyway...

My takeaway of my first visit to a Bush's Fried Chicken? They're spot on representing true Texas Fried Chicken (although not as good as my Mom's from Kerville, TX! Lol!). My only regret is that I should have tried out some of the sides and some of the iced tea. I'll be sure to do that on my next visit as l definitely plan coming back for some more great Texas Fried Chicken! Hook 'em Babee!"}
{"text":"How can you mess up fried chicken this badly?! The one star is solely for the kind and courteous staff who tried their best, despite the awful food. 

Everything about the meal was gross. Sweet tea was sickeningly sweet - had a syrupy consistency. Mac and Cheese was mushy and flavourless. Fries were obviously from a freezer bag. And the chicken? Inedible. Tough to bite through; they're as bland as the photos look. We literally had to throw out our entire meal. 

Never returning. Don't see this chain lasting more than a year.

Edit/Update: Was I right, or was I right?"}
{"text":"Bush's Chicken is a Fast Food Restaurant Chain based from Texas. They specialize in Southern Style Fried Chicken and also serve Chicken Tenders. They also offer some items you don't usually come by like Chicken Livers, Gizzards, Fried Okra. 

I don't usually do fast food but the independent restaurant I planned to do take out from wasn't serving food that day so we were curious about Bush's Chicken and thought we'd give Bush's a try since it was near by. 

Our order was taken quickly by someone at the register and we were off with our family pack of assorted parts of chicken, 5 extra soft rolls, a side of macaroni and cheese and a side of mashed potatoes.

I go to take a bite of chicken and it was almost good. It was fried nice and seemed oil free. It had a nice crisp exterior. The meaty chicken was nice and flavorful. Unfortunately it was coated with a LETHAL amount of salt. It was impossible to eat unless you peeled the coating off.....Shame because it almost was good. Even my husband that likes over salted foods couldn't eat it either as the chicken was also too salty for him TOO!....The chicken was inedible unless the skin and coating were peeled off.

I go to taste a roll....It was very soft and sweet and seemed like processed white bread but softer and sweeter. 

Then I taste the florescent orange macaroni and cheese. It has a similar taste to the blue box kind but seemed less cheesy and less buttery.

Lastly I taste the mashed potatoes. The potatoes are very dense and have a lot of pepper in them and another weird taste I can't identify......the weird taste didn't taste food related.....It bothered me so much that I contacted Bush's in Texas and asked them about what is suppose to be in those potatoes. I was told that they are just suppose to be buttermilk mashed potatoes. The taste I tasted wasn't buttermilk and I don't know what it was.....but I couldn't eat the potatoes and neither could my husband. The potatoes didn't taste good to either of us and my husband tried to eat them with the gravy and he still couldn't get them down.

#1-Chicken coated in a lethal amount of salt
#2-Rolls taste like processed
#3-Macaroni and Cheese taste less cheesy than blue box kind
#4-Mashed Potatoes were very dense and had an unknown unpleasant taste in them

I do note that they had an all kid crew working when I was there and I do note that they can't be this horrible all the time or they wouldn't be in business.

Good Luck!"}
{"text":"Okay, we only go here when there's a coupon.  It is right by our home, and the MMA LAB.  Basically, we think their chicken and sides are way overpriced.  Without a coupon we never go.

The chicken is pretty good - crispy crunch and golden color - no brown.  Monster white meat sizes - both, breasts and wings.  They brine the chicken as you can taste the salt in the breast meat.  This helps it stay more tender.    Sides are okay.  The real winner here is their yeast rolls which are extremely good.  The tea sucks in my opinion.

If you like gizzards, then this is probably your heaven in AZ!  

They always have tons of chicken cooked up, and it was surprisingly busy when we went for lunch this last Saturday after my son's 3 hour workout at the LAB -wrestling, boxing and BJJ. Maybe everyone had coupons like us.

Their chicken tenders I felt are disappointing when compared to Canes (just down the street) whom I crown the chicken tender rock stars!

If you have a coupon, maybe give it a try.  Otherwise, you better have a wallet like the state of Texas cause you'll spend some big bucks here feeding a family with their big chicken and not so big sides."}
{"text":"Not very impressed with there chicken fingers at all maybe I need to try there chicken instead 
Mashed potatoes where okay, nothing special 
There bread was amazing 
Friendly staff 
I'm really not sure I would go back to this place. 
If you must try it, go on Tuesday when they have the Tuesday special.. they do have happy hour 2 to 5 and there sweet tea is pretty good, watch out raising Caine's."}
{"text":"Not so good. Extremely slow service.  Chicken not very tasty. Instant mashed potatoes. Gravy no flavor.  As we were eating there were 15 people waiting in line for service.  Pretty expensive for what you get.  We wont be back."}
{"text":"Wow, it's only been about a month since Bush's opened and the quality has slipped to the point where I'll never bother eating here again. Fresh?? I had chicken livers, more like chicken liver jerky... My daughter had some cold chicken tenders over wilted lettuce. Not to mention the car person forgot part of the order and packed no napkins or utensils with the meal... another fast food chain on bell soon to be boarded up. Or maybe you can turn back the clock to your grand opening level of quality and service."}
{"text":"Sitting here eating the 4 piece tenders. Not a fan of pink chicken. 1st time the food was ok. Definetely down hill since. The service is terrible. Placebos almost empty and you wait for ever. Gonna mark this off the list as a return."}
{"text":"Crappy service.  They don't offer a salad here like they do at their other location on Bell.  His response was \"huh?  What?\" with a disgruntled face, like me asking for a salad with chicken here was like asking for a hot dog."}
{"text":"This place is pretty brand new.  It's close to my salon, so I thought I'd check it out and see what it's all about.  The staff were very welcoming.  Seemed as their were lots of questions amongst each other about everything from the computers to how many pieces of chicken went in my salad.  Every time I drive by, they seem to be extremely packed, so I can only hope that they can get the little mishaps under control before they truly get their feet in the ground.  Salad is pretty tasty Abby fresh with Jalape√±o Ranch dressing.  I'll be back soon to try other items."}
{"text":"Very bland chicken and sides. I've had better chicken from the frozen food isle. This tasted like something I'd get served at a retirement home. Save your time, money and drive to Raising Canes. I will give them a 1 star for the freshness but that's me being generous."}
{"text":"I'm going to split the difference with all of the polarizing reviews and say that it is actually a pretty solid fast-food chicken experience.  Good sides and everything had a unique seasoning that I found pleasing.  I don't do fried chicken often but this is a solid place when that itch needs to be scratched."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The side dishes were great. Price is very affordable, portions are large. Staff was friendly and very attentive. Definitely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"its ok for fast food white gravy on mashed  potatoes not my fav but ok  chicken ok odd ordering style but over all fast food ok"}
{"text":"Cynthia gave us the best service we had anywhere in months!  Thank you!

Chicken was good, gravy amazing, we will back."}
{"text":"Disappointed

This was my first visit to Bush's Chicken, and the food just isn't very good in my opinion. On this visit I ordered the 2 strip chicken combo with gravy and fries. 

As you walk into Bush's Chicken, you can't help but notice a large amount or chicken already made and ready to be served. My only thought was, how long has that chicken been sitting there.  I received my meal as I was paying the cashier. Probably, 30 seconds after I placed my order, I received my meal.

This chicken strips were awful. My chicken strips were cold, had very little chicken, however, had lots of coating, which to be honest was flavorless. The fries were luke warm at best, and did not taste fresh and the rolls had an overwhelming taste of yeast. The entire meal with the exception of the gravy which was good, was poor at best. 

The services was good that's why I feel terrible for calling out their food as being poor. However, I'm in no rush to go back."}
{"text":"Checked out the tenders and chicken awesome !! Fast service on drive Thur was surprised since they just opened and we're very busy no wait love the spiced salt wanted to try poppers but they were sold out ?"}
{"text":"Gross!  I ordered the chicken tender meal with macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes and gravy! The chicken tenders were ok. Nothing I would rave about. The macaroni and cheese was awful ! The worse I have ever had.  Disgusting is an understatement. Mashed potatoes and gravy were also gross! I ended up throwing both sides away. No one in the family could stomach them after the first bite. The rolls tasted like the ones you buy prepackaged from the grocery store. You can eat at some great restaurants for the same price they charge. I will never go back. If this business wants to survive they will need to evaluate the food they are serving and make some major adjustments. Yuck"}
{"text":"Best chicken strips I've ever had! I don't even like chicken strips but I find myself coming here 2x a week. Sydney is the best, she has served me almost every time and she always remembers me even though this place is super busy. She's always super quick and really polite so I love coming to see her. My favorite thing here is the gravy it's amazing I eat it on everything."}
{"text":"Very quick and very nice customer service. Very unique drive they but way better food order and helpful employees. Chicken is delish and biscuits are very yummy. Way way better then KFC!!! Will be going back."}
{"text":"I ordered a 12pc gizzard and wanted to add on a drink and mashed potatoes with gravy.  The guy who took my order  (I believe his name was Aaron) was super cool and hooked me up with an 8pc meal with several extra pcs  that was the same price as the 12pc alone. The gizzards were awesome!! My wife got the chicken tenders and said that she liked them better than cains. We'll go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Decent fried chicken. Very similar to churches however there breading is a little shell like and there's a bit too much of it. It slides ride of instead of sticking to the chicken. Popeyes is still king in the chain category, and if I want churches type chicken I'll just get churches. It's better. One thing I might try if I go back is the gizzards, I don't see those often but I like them when done right."}
{"text":"Not the best fried chicken for sure. There is more of the coating than chicken. Also had the chicken livers,which were pretty good. One side was fried okra,but they forgot the dipping sauce. Other was cole slaw which is very much like KFC,but better. I'm really not impressed,and will most likely not be going back."}
{"text":"First time eating at this chicken joint- Kiandra was great. She immediately made some recommendations and they were perfect! I think we just replace KFC cravings in our house"}
{"text":"I was not impressed. I was excited to try a new fried chicken joint, but left disappointed. The chicken was bland, had no flavor. The coleslaw was soggy, kinda like Kentucky Fried Chicken's gross coleslaw. My wife ordered a chicken salad. All they did was cut up a few chicken strips and slapped them on top of what seemed like a grocery store bought salad pack. I gave them 2 stars only because they had great biscuits and tea.....but that's it!"}
{"text":"I ate here last night...i wasn't too shocked about the chicken tenders..the roll was pretty good and the mash potatoes...the gravy was ok...the tenders taste just like popeye's only with more salt...trust me i worked at popeye's"}
{"text":"My wife and I were hopeful that this new chicken place would be worth the wait. Sadly...it was not! Service was subpar on almost every level. Look, I get that it's a fast-food restaurant, so we weren't expecting a five-star experience; however, knowledgeable and speedy service, accompanied by a smile would have been nice. My wife is MSG intolerant, and asked the young woman who took her order if there was any in the seasonings. The young lady was unsure, so to her credit she checked a label. She read out loud the ingredients, but skipped over the mono sodium glutamate part. We later noticed (after having already eaten) on the bottle of seasoning that was on our table that it contained MSG. My wife is now experiencing headaches from the seasoned-with-MSG seasoning that was in the chicken in the chicken salad. No excuses for that!!! 

The chicken was average, at best: not great, but not bad. I'd have to say that the meal was an overall bland and less than satisfying experience.The roll, however, was really good and extremely tasty!!! The tea was good, as well!

Despite this unflattering review I would be willing to maybe try Bush's one more time. I doubt very much that my wife will be returning, though."}
{"text":"My son and I went for an early lunch and had the place to ourselves.  When we walked in, there was a strange smell.  At first I thought it might be an employee's musk cologne or perfume.  I had a hard time getting past the strong smell throughout the whole restaurant.  Maybe it was a room deodorizer?  If it was an employee, hopefully the manager can discuss maintaining a scent free environment.  The only thing I want to smell is the food.  It was also strange that I didn't pay at the register.  The cashier came to my table to take the payment.  The food was great, my son loved the rolls.  Maybe we'll try the drive through next time!"}
{"text":"I like the sweet tea and the food. I didn't think we'd get a place to sit as the place was packed, but the flow was just right for food ordering, food getting, and going right to a seat which was vacated just a minute before. It's like magic!"}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place existed until my wife and I drove by and decided to try it. What a mistake!

The chicken tenders taste like someone dumped a bucket of salt on them. Just nasty. The service is slow, slow, slow, slow. We ate an entire meal (took about 20 minutes) and the order we had to go was still not ready. There was no dark meat chicken and, as you know, chicken takes a while to cook. So our two piece meal to go had one piece of dark meat from 20 minutes earlier, sitting in a box, until the lava-hot chicken came out of the fryer and was placed next to it.

The employees do everything, which is incredibly inefficient. For example, there is a fountain machine for customers, and one behind the counter for staff (for the drive thru). However, no customers were ever given empty cups to fill themselves. Instead, customers are just standing around, waiting and waiting and waiting, staring blankly while waiting, waiting, waiting, while staff fills the drinks. Since the staff can't fill the drinks and fill your order at the same time, it means the customer gets to wait even longer. Too much ice in your drink? Just wait until they give it to you, then you can dump it out and fill it yourself! This is a ridiculous process.

Furthermore, the single employee set about to gather our order brought out my fries and chicken tenders and left them on the counter. After about 5 minutes, I took it to the table to start eating and it was already cold. The other meal we ordered? No where in sight!

I had just about finished my chicken tenders meal when the other meal we ordered finally was ready for us. What a terrible process!

The chicken tenders are tiny. About 1/2 to 1/3 the size of the chicken tenders offered at Cane's (and Cane's charges less). You get white gravy with your chicken tenders, whether you want it or not. Just a waste of food for someone like me who doesn't eat gravy.

There are just two trash cans in the entire dining area, and they are side by side. So if you're eating at the opposite end, you have to walk your tray of trash across the entire restaurant, weaving in-between all the people who are waiting, waiting and waiting. Then, once I arrived at the trash cans, I couldn't use either one because they were both over-flowing with trash and could hold no more!

The salad we ordered wasn't good, either. Lot's of end pieces and clumps that no one could be bothered to separate.

No one was cleaning the dining area. Before we sat down to eat, I had to use a paper towel and bus my own table.

The only good part of the meal was the dinner roll. This is odd, since at most chicken restaurants, in our experience, the roll is the worst part.

So, that's the only positive thing I can say about this place - good dinner rolls. Avoid everything else unless you love salt!

Enjoy your salty chicken. We'll eat somewhere that is more aggressively priced, has faster service and serves food without burying it in salt. (popeyes, churches, canes, chick-fil-a, etc...)"}
{"text":"OK, to be honest, I'd give most fast food one or two stars. There are a couple semi-fast Mexican and pizza dives that rate higher but for the run of the mill boring a** \"food\" nothing more than a star or two. We got a family dinner w/ coleslaw and a side of mac & cheese. The coleslaw was supposed to be cold but the rest of it should have at least been warm. What part of the chicken is \"tenders\"? Is this some new part they're growing now with all the additives they're being fed? That $26.19 could have bought a couple amazing steaks from the market and all the trimmings. With that in mind, I'll be adding this to my list of \"never again\" eateries."}
{"text":"This Texas family was so excited that a piece of home had come to Gilbert that we were in line for tenders within days of this location's opening. Our first dinner here was disappointing, but we allowed the restaurant time to work out the kinks. I S topped in for lunch today, and am disappointed again. The chicken tenders and bread are not to the same quality of the many Bush's Chicken restaurants I frequented at home in central Texas. I wish the best for my hometown goodness, but unfortunately don't expect to return anytime soon myself."}
{"text":"The ordering process was much better today. I ordered, she filled it, I paid. Clean and I got what I wanted. 

The gravy is just ok. I expected more. I added the overly salty spice thing off the table and some hot sauce. It was better. 

The chicken was good the fries were good, the roll was great. Lol"}
{"text":"I was hoping to finally try this place and then I see people outside taking orders in over 110 degree weather not ok. I refuse to support I business seeing people having to be outside like that."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Highly recommend. Every time we have gone there it has been quick and wonderful service. We have been greeted by managers and cashiers. They are all so kind and welcoming. They also give you an overview of the menu and kind of what you have to expect from the food and sauces. Thank you all for making the best experience. We live right in between raising canes and bush's and we choose bushs every time."}
{"text":"Tried for first time and nothing really special. Had the mixed chicken (regular pieces) which were crunchy outside and moist chicken inside, but no flavor on skin. Instead the flavor was actually in the meat, but subtle nothing great nor spicy. They do provide seasoned salt packets. Also, got an order of fried gizzards which were real good, according to one person in my household that loves gizzards. They came with a small container of white gravy or chicken gravy that tasted pretty good like seasoned sausage gravy. The best thing was the sweet, yeast rolls that came with everything. Those were freaking good, soft, moist and sweet goodness.

I prefer spicy chicken or really seasoned strong fried chicken, so this may not be a place I would go for fried chicken too often. I will try them again to see how their tenders are and for those rolls. Little pricey like some other chicken places, but at least it wasn't dry and hard like those other places."}
{"text":"Brand new fried chicken joint at Bell Rd and 73rd Ave. Apparently, this is a beloved chicken chain from Texas, though I'd never heard of it before seeing the signs for this store. Menu has fried chicken, chicken tenders, a livers and gizzards option, and a good variety of sides. Meals come with sweet yeast rolls and gravy.

Had a good experience our first time. Went through the drive-thru. It was different. Three lanes. No speaker system or window. Instead someone comes out, takes your order, gets the food, takes payment, then you're on your way. Tried the 12 tender family meal. 12 tenders, a family side (we got fries), 4 rolls, and a large gravy, all for $19.99! That's got to be one of the best dinner deals around. Everything was good. Nothing mind blowing, but just a decent chicken meal. Chicken was fresh with thin crispy coating. Fries were crinkle fries. My husband wasn't keen on the creamy gravy (he's from the NE and just doesn't get gravy. lol.), but I liked it. We all loved those pillowy soft sweet yeast rolls. I'm curious to see how the indoor eating area is and to try their fried chicken and other sides. Will certainly be back again.

Overall, 3.5 stars. People were nice. Food was fresh. Prices are very reasonable. Worth trying if you like fried chicken."}
{"text":"First time trying it out, was so excited because a new chicken joint was in town! They didn't have Mac n cheese as a side, cause they were out of it. It was 50% off when I went, but even then not worth it! The chicken tenders were soooo small and lacking flavor, & too much breading. The fries were so soggy I couldn't eat them. I suggest going to Cane's or even Chick Fil A!"}
{"text":"I've had Bush's when we were staying in San Antonio and I've been eager to have it in Phoenix. The chicken pieces were quite large, fresh, moist, and delicious. The breading is similar to Church's but still unique. The mashed and white gravy was unspectacular. I think I'll try orka next time. The roll was soft, fresh, and delicious.

This location has three drive-thru lanes where someone comes out to take your order. Staff was welcoming and friendly. I wish them well and look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The chicken is very fresh and tasty. The staff was very friendly. The only reason I gave it a four was for the price. I felt it was expensive for what I received."}
{"text":"It was my first time ordering food here, my cousins like this place, but they always tell me they forget stuff all the time. Well, that's exactly what happened to me earlier this week as well. We ordered the mix and match family combo with a drink and they forgot our okra. I called they said they'll cover it the next time we are in, unfortunately we will no longer go back.
Our large soda was literally ALL ice, it was ridiculous, my bf ended up finishing it in the mile and a half it took us to get home.
Once we got home, like stated above we realize our okra was missing, then while I was eating my chicken I noticed a piece of chicken was missing too.
But I didn't even bother to call about it because we ended up not even eating it because of how INCREDIBLY SALTY it was, which is unfortunate because I LOVED how crispy their skin was.
Later on that night all of us who had chicken were literally taking turns on the porcelain throne, probably due to high sodium in our system or food poisoning.

Only gave two stars because the staff was nice, bread was good, and loved how crispy everything was. But with 2 missing items, incredibly salty batter and meat, along with a wrecked stomach for all of us, not worth it.

Oh and I am the Queen of Salt, but even this tasted like I was drinking salt, mouth dried up and everything."}
{"text":"What can I say? Fast food is fast food. I must admit the food is so so considering I've only had the chicken tenders. The service is outstanding beginning with the store manager and his staff. Here's where my \"pardon the pun\"beef begins; The restaurant is simply sterile! the esthetics are horrible. The walls are white with red. the lights are too bright and to make it it worst they have so many windows that the sunlight overtakes the dining area. Its like having lunch in the ER of a major hospital. I realize it's a franchise restaurant but please bring down the lights create a warm welcome feeling not a cold and sterile environment. You guys should be creating an environment
 that says \"welcome, sit and enjoy your meal\" Instead it feels like here's your food now eat and get out.  The big wigs in Tx should consider hiring a phycologist or a marketing expert  to explain how different colors affect people."}
{"text":"Went to the one on 7th Ave & Bell today for the first time. This place has the weirdest drive thru I have ever seen. It is kind of a Sonic-type set up. You pull up in one of three lanes, after running over an old fashioned signal hose (ding, ding) - like those at gas stations of yesteryear. Someone comes out and takes your order. They then go inside and package your order. You pay when they come out with your food (ala Sonic). They do not have change belts, so they need to go back in to process your payment. In the meantime, if the person ahead of you has a large order (and yours comes out first), you cannot pull out if there is someone in the other lanes. Employees surely get their 10,000 steps in each day. Don't know how they operate in the rain. Beyond strange....

Beside that, my waiter/car hop, Ty, was awesome!! He took the time to explain the different menu options to me (I was the only car initially). I wanted a combination not on the menu (livers and chicken pieces), and he helped me order the most cost effective way. The chicken is similar to Church's batter, but much better quality and not as greasy. The pieces were surprisingly large! It's marinated, so it's juicy. The chicken livers are great - right amount of batter, and not dried out. The country gravy is quite good, and so are the mashed potatoes. The corn fritters are addictive. I will definitely go back, but will go inside next time."}
{"text":"What a surprisingly good chicken place!  The best we've had since living in Texas and Atlanta!

*  At the drive-in lane, smiling, happy staff members walk out to your car to take your order and then deliver it.  How unusual!  But we liked the personal touch and the ability to easily ask questions.  
*  We ordered a family meal, chicken strips, fried okra, mashed potatoes and gravy, dinner rolls.  
*  Chicken strips are delicious!  The meat is tender and tastes like it was marinated.  The covering is light and crisp--almost like panko crust, but a little more solid.  Also, it's not greasy at all.
*  Mashed potatoes are just what you'd expect, and the white gravy is truly how it's made in the south.  Delicious!  Just the right amount of salt and pepper---not too much--and wonderfully thick.  The gravy is worth going back for!
*  Fried Okra--YUM!!!!  I've really missed fried okra!  One restaurant in Phoenix used to offer it (but theirs was too greasy, and they had terrible service, so they closed).  This okra is exactly how it's supposed to be!  The coating is light and not greasy.  The okra is fresh and flavorful and not stringy or dried out.  My only slight complaint is that they forgot to put ketchup in the box for us, but even without ketchup, these were wonderful.  
*  Dinner Rolls--FANTASTIC!  These are really good, Southern dinner rolls--soft, doughy, a little bit sweet.  Sort of like what you get at Texas Roadhouse, but even better!  
*  Packaging--I have to mention that the food was all packaged in nice boxes and tightly closed styrofoam containers.  Even though most of what we ordered was fried, no grease came through the bottoms of the boxes.  Everything was nice and neat and clean!

We will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"One word. NASTY!! Food was horrible both times and the employees are clueless. Tried a couple times and not once did I finish the meal! Will never return. Makes KFC taste and look like gourmet! ZERO STARS!"}
{"text":"This place is dangerous. It's very good and in no way healthy. Chicken strips, fries, mac and cheese, and jalape√±o poppers were amazing. The sweet tea was perfect as well. My absolute favorite was the ghost sauce and jalape√±o ranch. Some of the best Sauce I have ever had. We will be back, but only on cheat days."}
{"text":"More and more this seems to be the ideal Sunday spot to grab n go.  Located down the street I simply love how they have the curbside ordering concept. Today went with ordering chicken tenders, gizzard and liver mixed with gravy and mash potatoes ! Yes I said gizzard and liver that is lightly batter on light flakes. What made this recent worthwhile visit was the outstanding patience that my server Walter had, since I had my two dogs in the car. Walter happen to have two milkbones to feed my rabid jack Russell and miniature pinscher..lol. Thanks again Walter for your stellar customer service !"}
{"text":"First time we went there it was amazingly delicious. Perfect food. But each time we've gone back since, it's gotten increasingly worse. Today, my four piece meal contained basically three sticks of breading and one small tender. Just really unfortunate :/ the only saving grace is their rolls. I think we are done trying and will move on to another quick chicken place."}
{"text":"I'm giving Bush's 4 star cause their fried chicken was great a little grease but what great fried chicken isn't. The fries wasn't as crispy as I like but I did get it to go so that could've been the reason, I really like the seasoned salt packets and the roll. I'll give other items (sides) a try but I'll be back for the chicken."}
{"text":"Skip it!  The tenders were rubbery and super salty!  The mashed potatoes tasted like instant!  Canes is way tastier down the street!"}
{"text":"I had two chicken breast meal with a side of fried okra and also a chicken finger meal with a side of coleslaw. Employees were very friendly and the place was clean.  Chicken had good flavor and was hot and fresh and tasty"}
{"text":"Worst drive through chicken ever! Had to grab a quick bite between appointments and stopped here. I could barely bite into it, it was so tough and stringy.  Needless to say, I didn't eat it. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Chicken as another reviewer said, \"could have been good\", overkill on the salt, inedible. I'm glad I only got the 3 piece to try it out first, don't know what I would've done with a ton of chicken we couldn't eat. Good tea, good rolls, probably the best was the mashed potatoes. Still a Popeyes fan, also love, love LoLo's. Gave this place 3 stars only because it's new and i'm not sure if the chickens always gonna be this salty, not willing to try again though. Also very strange that way they do the , \"drive through\", you just park under this big porch and there is only a menu on the building and we could see other people trying to look over and we were in their way, weird, the should put a board up in the middle and other side there must be like room for three or four lanes, the people come out and get your order and that's cool but I can't imagine why they would keep that tradition in Phoenix, it being 110 to 120 lately. God Bless them, the girl was super sweet and still managed to smile"}
{"text":"This is our first time visiting bushes chicken, and let me start off with friendly staff, especially the asst manager Shikura.  The chicken looks tender and crispy, I'm about to dig in...will continue. The two chicken breast I had was delicious..."}
{"text":"To say it simple it's like canes on steroids.A mix between canes and kfc for the amount of southern sides,always comes with gravy. The chicken is a golden yellow color very crispy. For me a little salty but a side of ranch fixed it right away. If your a sweet tea fan it's pretty good and drink sizes are huge. staff is very friendly,patient and polite."}
{"text":"I've only tried the chicken and rolls and fries.  They were exceptional and the customer service is great too.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Mediocre! Me, and my partner were excited for the grand opening. While passing along Bell Rd. We saw it was opened! We decided to stop in (which it was 50% off certain combos) everyone greeted us! Okay, we placed our order which was the 20 tenders, fries, gravy, 4 dinner rolls. My partner likes ranch with her tenders so I went back up to ask for some.. they sell them .39 each or 4 for $1. Moving on we started eating our chicken tenders, and right away I didn't like them... the batter was too flaky crispy for me. The crinkle fries were good, gravy was decent, rolls were good. Just their main product chicken was ehhhh!! It's a no for us! It just sucks because we had high hopes for this place! Something new... I guess the competitors win over this place."}
{"text":"Been going to the 7th Ave/Bell Rd place since it opened up a few months ago.  Food was a little pricey, but it was good, so I didn't mind paying a little more.  However over the past 3/4 months ths quality has really gone downhill. Chicken is still good, but the mashed potatoes have gotten a little spicy to hot.  You can see big flakes of pepper in the potatoes. The dinner rolls when we first got them were big and golden brown with great flavor...now they are over baked, hard, flat and no flavor.  My wife and I have mentioned this to the Management in the resturant and nothing gets done about it...I will NOT be going back to Bushes Chicken.  My opinion...if you want chicken go to KFC."}
{"text":"Haven't even tried the food yet. Been waiting in the most inefficient drive-thru of all time for at least 15 minutes. I'll update when I finally get my food. If you don't see anything below this, it's safe to assume I died while waiting."}
{"text":"The chicken here seems fattier than some?  This was my second visit and My daughter only noticed the fatty layer on the thighs.  It does not seem to be much of a step up from Church's. I think for some reason it is more acceptable in the burbs than Church's which seem to only be located in lower income areas in our community.  
Livers - good
Gizzards- good
Mac -- very good
Green beans- good but could use more seasoning
Coleslaw- very good
Corn on the Cobb- daughter ordered a second one - very good
Rolls -- very good

Service always energetic and extremely courteous and accommodating. Leaders are very engaged. Team is enthusiastic.
General feeling is that the quality of they chicken they buy is middle of the road to lower."}
{"text":"I came here because of a post I saw on a Facebook page and I'm super happy I did. I don't eat fried chicken  to often but this place may change that. The chicken isn't greasy, it has plenty of actual meat and the skin is so crispy that it was hard to not eat it all. The dinner roll was buttery, soft and delicious! The mashed potatoes were creamy and the perfect amount to accompany my meal.

The drive through isn't your typical drive through. You are face to face with a person and the girl who took my order was incredibly friendly. I ordered and within a couple of minutes she was back with our food.

Bottom line is this is an awesome place, friendly staff, quick service with amazing chicken!  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We are here yesterday for lunch. First time customers. The food was really good. Prices were good as well. My daughter and I ate for $12. The chicken tenders were cooked just right. I really liked the mashed potatoes and gravy too. I ordered a family size fries. We had a bunch left over, you get a ton. The staff was super friendly too. We will be back for sure. Oh, we tried a bunch of sauces and they were all good."}
{"text":"The chicken here tastes so fresh! The skin is lightly-flavored but very crispy and flaky. The options in side dishes are a-plenty and equally as delicious! I also had their sweet tea, very good! 

The dining room was clean and presentable. The front counter staff was friendly and patient. 

I will definitely be going back here."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.....got liver and gizzards (I know weird) but usually are delish. The were very dry and tasteless.....Popeyes used to make them and they were great. Also ordered a 2 piece dark combo.... They told me they were out of thighs .......WHAT!!!! I was hoping they would be good but I'm going back to Popeyes or Churchs"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time really hoping to enjoy the place. Employees were friendly, building clean and the food looked great. I don't normally write bad reviews but I will never return to Bush's, Canes is a little further down the road and is far better. 

The chicken was very salty, the mashed potatoes were gross, the gravy was the blandest I've ever had and the small side salad was old (brown on many leaves, slimy on others YUCK)."}
{"text":"We are from Texas and LOVE Bush's Chicken. This location is now open and did not disappoint! Check out the Tuesday family meal. Juicy chicken, soft rolls and amazing tea....Yummy!!"}
{"text":"We did an order of chicken livers they were made fresh and still hot when we got home lightly breaded and not over seasoned best we have had even better than Filly's in Aj when they made them I will update post when we try the chicken so far so good."}
{"text":"Bush's Chicken is like a KFC but also a competitor to Cane's. 

Pros: The best sweet tea I've ever tasted! 

Besides the sweet tea, there isn't too much I can say about this place. I ordered a 2 piece chicken meal on my first visit but I thought the chicken was pretty bland and nothing spectacular. No sauce was given or offered and no seasoning packets like I see in other posts. I have yet to try their liver or gizzards. 

I've only been to Bush's twice now and the second time was only for their sweet tea. 

Not sure if I will be back just for their chicken anytime soon."}
{"text":"Even though the customer service was solid, I'm rating it at a 2 because the chicken was that bad.

5 stars for customer service
-friendly
-attentive
-welcoming

1 star for chicken
Not sure if I had a bad batch but it was the worst fried chicken I've had. It was flavorless and uninspired. The gravy was lacking seasoning as well."}
{"text":"Bump from one star to two because of fantastic service, but the food was disgusting.  Greasy, flavorless, and gross. The Mac n cheese was worse than kraft in a box. The corn was mush... the bread was tasty.... better options are everywhere."}
{"text":"Nothing special here...this was my first visit and possibly my last. My visit started by walking in  three people standing at the counter or walking around ,  who then argued about who was taking my order .  That is a great way to start ... Ordered baked chicken, okra, and macaroni and cheese. About 10 minutes after I put in my order young lady came and told me that it would be 10 more minutes for the baked chicken, yay I'm on my lunch half hour... she tells me I can get something else so I went with a fried chicken. She returns with my food and must have served the okra and macaroni and cheese when I first place the order because they were both cold, not a little cold but flat-out cold. Tell you that the chicken wasn't bad but everything else was just marginal. The staff an older lady an older gentleman and a young lady we're not very friendly or very helpful. This is not recommended"}
{"text":"Horrible service, disgusting food, they even charge extra for ranch with kids meals. Give me a breat. 
GO TO RAISING CANES."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying Bush's for the first time as a new place and for it apparently being the first one outside of Texas. I do not know how you dry out chicken thighs but they did, not juicy at all. The flavor is average at best, does not seem as if there is any spices and is quite bland for a \"special marinade\". They do give you seasoned salt (with a spicy option) that does improve it but why not serve it that way? I also ordered the gizzards which is why I went with a 3 and not a 2 rating. I have not come across them here in town. Again very average flavor and nothing special. The gravy that they are served with is the same. All in all the first experience does not make we want to return and I would recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've had Bush's twice before and it was very good . Today it was super breaded and the bread I g was so thick it was like concrete ? What's going on ? KFC would have been better . I also ordered 2 breasts and a leg , got home and only 2 breasts but the breeding to meat ratio was ridiculous . Too bad it was good at first ."}
{"text":"Lack of salt and complete FLAVOR in everything 110%. Nice employees but just not good. AT ALL. Nothing good about this place. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place since since it's new.

A bit like Canes, chicken with no flavor, I guess that's what the sauce is for. It was just okay.

Roll was really good, and I ordered mac n cheese as a side which was good.

I don't drink soda very often, I almost always get unsweetened iced tea which I did here and it was okay, nothing special.

Overall it was Good, I might come back if I'm the area, but wouldn't make a trip just to come here."}
{"text":"Bush's is new to Gilbert, and Gilbert is ready for a fried chicken place (I'm a fan of Church's as well, but the nearest one is in Chandler). They opened recently, so they were a bit busy, but the staff were friendly and helpful. The fried chicken is good, some of the better fried chicken I've had since moving to AZ a couple years ago. The gravy on the mashed potatoes was a little plain for my taste. Good prices on food as well. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Today we tried Bush's Chicken as I have been told the chicken isn't that good but they have some of the best sweet tea! I could not agree more with this random stranger! 
The Chicken: chicken has not a lick of seasoning, the skin on this chicken was so hard it had to be thrown out and the meat itself must be eaten while hot or warm otherwise it is like one big piece of lard! Yes they give you packets of the special seasoning but good cooks know you season food while hot (sidebar: this was a togo meal) 
The Dinner Roll: rolls soft, warm with a hint of butter. I could live in those dinner rolls they were so delicious
Mac and Cheese: it was horrible, like the chicken if lacks serious flavor! It was noodle with an orange color to it 
French Fries: although the fries had no salt on them (just the way I like them) they were quite delicious not to soft but also not too crispy. 
Sweet Tea: yes the random stranger was correct, they do have some pretty good tea. 
I can honestly say I/we will more than likely only come back for the dinner rolls and tea!"}
{"text":"I don't get this place. Not quite Cane's not quite Popeye's. They were out of Liver's which I really wanted to try so I had the tenders. The were alright. The gravy that comes with is bland and so is the okra. The Bush's table hot sauce is pretty good! Something tasted weird about the honey when I tried to put it on the roll which was also alright. The poppers, alright. The chicken, alright. What's really weird is they didn't want us to pay till they brought us out food. Then forgot to bring us out change. It's a new place but basic. Price is reasonable but service is non-caring. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent!! Customer Service, fresh crispy hot chicken, awesome Fried Okra! My husband loved the gizzards too, we will definitely be back to enjoy more! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Bush's Chicken is apparently relatively new to the valley. There's not that many locations yet but I will tell you this it's worth the drive. I deliver for ubereats and picked up several orders and got curious, how would Bush's Chicken stack up against the competitors KFC, Popeyes, Church's, and I got to tell you I was very very pleased with the results. They have your standard chicken fare but on top of that they have deep fried chicken livers and gizzards the livers are just melt in your mouth, the regular chicken moist and succulent you got to go try Bush's Chicken you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Just tried these guys through UberEats, and we were pleasantly surprised! Their chicken is nice and crunchy, and while their mashed potatoes were clearly fake, their country gravy is great! It is a white pepper gravy, not brown, and was really good on the potatoes and the chicken.  Skip the Mac and cheese, it's mediocre at best, and the rolls weren't amazing either. But the chicken and the gravy will need to be ordered again."}
{"text":"So disappointed. With the various other chicken options in the area, I was expecting more from this place. The chicken tenders were dry and rubbery, the gravy tasted like plastic, and the fries were soggy. Couldn't finish my meal. The only redeeming part of the experience was the sweet roll and the car side customer service. Better off going somewhere else."}
{"text":"The stars are for the chicken only. Not the sides. I will go buy my sides elsewhere and get a huge box of chicken from here. Best fried chicken I have had, except Lo Los of course."}
{"text":"we went here and paid $41 for a 10 pc and we came home and it only had 7 chicken and when we went back try to fix it they said sorry we can't help you and we can't give the 3 extra chicken haha what a fucking joke."}
{"text":"The building is very clean and staff is very friendly, but the food left a LOT to be desired. I ordered the chicken tenders with mac n cheese. Chicken is very blonde and not very crunchy or flavorful, and pieces are so thin the chicken was kind of dry and a little chewier than I would have liked. Edible, but tenders need to be thicker, crisper, juicier, and seasoned please. Mac and cheese wasn't bad, but would have liked it to be creamier rather than look like noodles covered in American cheese. Roll and gravy are pretty good though."}
{"text":"Good food, great price! Better than KFC for sure  if you want fried food. Their portions are big so order wisely. I don't like that the employees have to stand outside and take your order. Intercom systems prevent this so I don't understand the purpose of having an employee stand in 115 degree weather in Arizona. Other than that, decent food!"}
{"text":"Do not go here. I order here today 3 piece meal with fries and roll of bread. The chicken and roll of bread were good but after I ate fries I had hair in my mouth. They should be reported to health department and check the restaurant compliance. I would not eat another chicken here..."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying they have the best Sweet Tea I've had out here so far. I just moved from Atlanta out here so I know my sweet tea. I had the 2 chicken strip combo. The chicken has good flavor, not as greasy as Cane's but the sauce options set it apart from Canes, not to mention other choices on the menu and the rolls are baked in store. I had the Mac n cheese as my side, not the worst, but not the best either. Overall my first Bush's experience was good, I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We got some great coupons from my kids' school!  Didn't expect to like this place so much....but we really did!  

They really took care of us. Very pleasant staff, lots of food for the price. I couldn't even finish my meal!

My kids actually ate the food and enjoyed it (they normally don't like chicken tenders). They gobbled up their corn and chicken. 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband remembers this place from when he was stationed in Texas, and was super excited that they opened up a place in Peoria. They have the BEST sweet tea on the planet! We both ordered tenders, fries, cole slaw and he had an order of gizzards (I'm not a fan). The chicken was super hot, fresh and crispy. The cole slaw was really tasty, and I wished that I had ordered a bigger container of it. My husband said the gizzards were good, but I will have to take his word for it. The fries were wangy, but I was more interested in the chicken and gravy :) The person who took our order leaned in the car window and was all up in my husbands face lol. It was interesting  as far as the service goes, but the food was as good as it was in Texas."}
{"text":"First time ever coming here today and would definitely recommend it! The young man who waited on us was very friendly and helpful giving my husband what the best deal was for what he wanted! The chicken was very moist and fresh, good sized pieces! I had the 4 piece tenders and my husband had the 3 piece meal and I can't say one negative thing as it was all delicious. I went up to the counter to ask for a take home box and to ask the guy who waited on us for his name and to let him know how awesome he was and that we were very impressed. When he told me his name was Ty and I said oh that's my husbands name too, he shook my hand and went right over to where my husband was sitting and shook his hand. 
To his manager -  you have got an amazing nice and helpful employee and we will definitely be back. Please let Ty know we appreciate how friendly he was and the food was delicious! Thank you"}
{"text":"Really good gizzards. Enjoyed the corn nuggets as well. Service was great and everyone was very friendly. Only reason for not giving 5 stars is that the dipping sauces are just generic Kens dressing."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out after getting some coupons this week. I was excited to see fried okra on the menu. Being a Southern girl from Oklahoma, I was raised eating okra and love it. They didn't disappoint. It was good. The mashed potatoes were great!  Lots of pepper, which is the way I make them.  The gravy had tons of flavor too. The rolls reminded me of school lunches and melted in your mouth.  The iced tea was nice & strong!  

The chicken strips were a bit disappointing.  While nice & crispy, they lacked seasoning. More salt & pepper! But they are great dipped in the gravy. We will go back and try the bone in chicken, because that tends to have more flavor.  Overall good food & good customer service."}
{"text":"I was hanging with my mom and she was in the mood for chicken, so we decided to try out this newer fast food spot. 

It was dead inside on a Saturday afternoon, which I attributed to it being so new. I don't know why. I shouldn't have. I should have taken it as a warning. Sigh.

The chicken tenders were meaty, but flavorless. Pepper poppers use that gross fake cheese.  

The kids meals don't have a healthy drink option. The best I could get was blue Powerade. 

The employee taking our order was nice as hell though."}
{"text":"Love their chicken with gravy and buns. I can't get enough. We have never been inside and the service is fast and efficient in the drive through."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to finally have good fried chicken from home here in AZ!  Would easily be five stars, but for some reason, corn nuggets aren't on the menu here.  (Boooooo!)"}
{"text":"I was on a hunt for gizzards today. I have yet to find any as good as I can get in many places in Louisiana. A good fried gizzard to me has the sinew from the rock pouch removed (that tough gristle part you are eating which ruins the experience) it has been parboiled, then lightly breaded and fried. It should be soft to the point you can pull the meat apart with your fingers easily, moist, and have a medium offal flavor to it. When or if you ever find a person or restaurant like that befriend that person or bookmark that restaurant.

Now, here is my experience with Bushs gizzards and livers.
The livers were over fried. Not to the point they were dust, but about 25% over fried. The batter on both the liver and gizzards was nice and just enough crisp, had a decent flavor to it but was extremely salty. The livers had a light to medium offal flavor, sadly as stated they were over fried so not very good. Had they been cooked properly that would have actually been fabulous, minus the extreme saltiness.

The gizzards did not have the rock pouch lining removed. Yes, that is the hard gristle texture you are eating in the middle of the gizzard when not removed. The gizzards were actually fried to exact perfection for the ones I had, they had a light to very low medium offal flavor. Salty as well. But the gristle center ruined the experience. Now frying to perfection doesn't mean they weren't chewy. They indeed were lightly chewy but not horrible at all. Had the center portion been removed I would have given them a 6 out of 10. They may have been parboiled, but if so certainly not long enough.

Decent in a pinch especially if you cut the center part out.

This review is based solely on the food itself and nothing else."}
{"text":"We have know been to this location twice. Once when it first opened and now. The first time we tried this place out it was super late and they were open :) The chicken tasted super fresh and crispy. Very bland but they give you Cajun seasoning salt which makes it really, really good. Crinkle fries and other sides to choose from.They sell small cubed ice in the bag. Apple pies are pretty awesome. 

The second time we went we got not so fresh chicken and no salt. This made a huge difference! I am on the fence and am willing to give it one more chance. I think you just need to make sure you get super fresh food.

The drive through process is a little confusing and needs more structure."}
{"text":"Excellent quality chicken. Not greasy. Rolls are good. Cheddar poppers are delicious. Drive thru forgot the coleslaw."}
{"text":"The great- baked chicken! Need to place an order for 45 minutes prior but certainly worth the wait! The sweet rolls are to die for. 
The good- all the sides are very tasty.
The bad- chicken tenders were very disappointing. Mostly bread than meat. 

Overall- Service was outstanding will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My family has yet to be disappointed. Their chicken strips are delicious and taste a lot like home made fried chicken. Mashed potatoes and gravy are an excellent addition to the chicken and biscuits. I have a large order of chicken gizzards and livers as well and they were excellent. Will definitely go back. One star dock is for drive through process. I sat to long and looked at the menu and they came out and stared me for a bit then told me to pull forward. Oops, my bad. 

They actually run out to your car, hand you a menu and then take your order. They actually make about 3-4 trips back and forth. Just a heads up.


Recent visit had is ordering a large meal to go. When we got home we noticed we were missing a lot of our sides. My fault for not checking, but they need to verify order is complete before handing it off."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time, I got the 2 tenders with fries, came by fast. You dont order through a soeaker, someone comes out and takes your order. The girl who took my order was extremely nice. Everything was great! i will add, the tenders were a bit salty, but still good!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Bush's chicken. I generally love fried chicken. So initially, I was excited to give them a shot. My first visit was OK,  just ok... I ordered a 2 piece combo of fried chicken, comes with a roll, a drink and a side. Chicken was good, but very greasy. Fries, and roll were ok. 2nd visit(months later) not any better. 3 piece tender combo, also comes with a roll, a drink, and a side. Tenders were crispy, cooked well, but lacked flavor. Mashed potatoes were ok, tasted instant.  Gravy was good, had a peppery flavor. Both of my experiences were lack luster. The service is fast and friendly, price is reasonable. With so many other choices in the area, I doubt I'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Everything good. Chicken good and large just wasn't a real fan of the batter, Potatoes gravy very good, rolls great, like Texas Roadhouse, mac and cheese good but little on dry side, liver and  gizzards very good, okra more slimy than expected for being fried, fast friendly service. Probably would go back,."}
{"text":"We love Bush's chicken! Their always friendly courteous and ready to help us order especially because were not used to the menu yet. I took my Mom after her doctor's appointment, she was starved and ordered the chicken gizzards, liver and two pieces of thighs for the both of us. Unfortunately, the thighs were a little under cooked but we loved everything else. We let the manager know and immediately they replaced our whole order fresh! Hat's off to Bush's chicken in AZ!"}
{"text":"I didn't have high hopes to begin with but Bushes was still a disappointment. Canes is a much better choice."}
{"text":"This was an emotional eating night and the food made my night better. Comfort food :) I personally can now say that I do enjoy Bush's chicken over Cane's chicken. I have tried both, I enjoy both, however, the crisp, the batter,the meat quality and the seasoning packets do this place well. I pull up to a drive thru, which is odd because there is no window but a very nice girl walked up to my car, provided excellent customer service as she explained the menu and placed my order. It was cheap, I ordered a six piece not realizing these strips are huge (and great). I also got gravy and smashed potatoes. All was excellent (had leftovers). The gravy was of great texture although slightly bland (this is why these tasty packets of salty greatness are provided, to season your meal as needed). The smashed potatoes had texture and flavor, I enjoyed them. The chicken, oh it was so good, hot, all white meat, super moist and crispy. Thank you, great food, great price, outstanding customer service :)"}
{"text":"Just got called \"boss\" twice, and was told to pull into the second lane. I then proceeded to wait in the drive through for 15 minutes.  My food order was never even taken so I decided to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times. The service is ush decent. Today was eh. I prefer if they load my family meal up with all the seasonings and hot sauce without asking. Napkins as well. Sometimes they do, sometimes not. I love their recipe. The gravy, ghost sauce and honey mustard. Buns r always wonderful.  My ush side is the okra. The staff varies, some r more effective than others. For super fast food, its good. I refuse to eat nasty kfc. I will b back when I need chicken tenders and I am in this part of town. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Their rolls are good.  Chicken meh.. so so.  The mash potatoes are horrible.  Its like they threw the box itself that the potatoes come in."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place today. I ordered the #3 which is the Liver/Gizzards meal. I chose just gizzards. Overall I enjoyed my meal. I'd prefer a biscuit over the roll and the food could've been a bit warmer. I'd go back"}
{"text":"This place is OK. I like the choice of dipping sauces and sides over a simple menu at other chicken places. Customer service could improve. Also, the decor inside makes me look over my shoulder waiting for Tammy to walk in."}
{"text":"The place is very clean and the staff is very friendly! Their chicken is very tasty, and there's a variety of besides to chose from! Best of all, the price is very cheap!"}
{"text":"Best friend chicken in the East Valley.
The fact that they have great fried okra seals the deal for me."}
{"text":"When this franchise first opened at 7th Ave and Bell my wife and I had their white meat meal which was two breasts. The meet was very dry and the batter was so crispy it was a tooth cracker. We figured it was first week training and settling in. Tonight (11/01/2017) I thought I'd give it another try. There was one cashier working at the dinner hour and I had to wait at least 8 minutes until I could place my order!  I ordered the 2 piece white meat mix and the cashier was kind enough to volunteer that would be a breast and a wing. Since when is a wing considered white meat?  My surprise earned me 2 breasts which was better by far. Standing to the side for my order after a couple minutes the clerk advised me they only had one breast left and it would take 7-8 minutes for more breasts. Dinner time, maybe 3 diners inside and 2 cars in drive-thru and they are out of breasts!  I cancelled the order and walked out. There must have been 5 workers in food prep, 2 workers tending to drive-thru and ONE cashier for waiting customers and she also had to assemble the orders for the inside diners. A lousy run store, lousy customer service and for all I know the chicken would have been equally poor. Obviously  the dinner time is not the time to be there and KFC need not worry about the competition."}
{"text":"During a visit to the Phoenix area we had an opportunity to try \"Bush's\" fried chicken at their new location in Gilbert. Their chicken is supposed to be famous in Texas, and I can say we enjoyed their juicy, crispy and flavorful fried chicken. This location has just been open a couple of weeks and is still a bit shaky on the service end, but not for want of trying from the friendly staff. If you are in the area and have a craving for good fried chicken, I recommend you try Bush's."}
{"text":"Did drive thru. Service was fast and good that's why the third star. Food is ehh. Chicken is super greasy and the taste is ok. I ordered the 8 piece family meal with 2 sides and 4 rolls. I also pictured the different side seasoning they give you. Will I go there again...drum roll...No."}
{"text":"2 visits to this location...first and last. 

We waited about 15 mins in line to order inside...15 mins of life we'll never get back! True it was 7P, but simply not enough staff on hand. 

Never got to taste the food, probably a good thing. They are understaffed...1 girl at inside counter, 1 to run food outside and a guy who doubles as inside counter order taker and chicken fryer.

2 others in back of store, one was likely manager, unloading a stock truck (really, at 7P when you are trying to serve?) but had 4 folks ahead of us and it took 15 mins to get up to counter to order. Like other reviews, understaff causing longer than normal wait times. 

When ordering was told they are out of several side dishes...like mac & chese, cole slaw, okra, green beans....we just looked at each other and grinned...then left after we were told that...with about 12 folks standing behind us. Went elsewhere. 

We won't return for several reasons: very poor customer service,  woefully understaffed, prices are higher than say a Popeye's and other similar places; from menu it appears all single sides are 1.99...but gravy for mashed potatoes is an extra .69. Huh? Side menu doesn't say mashed potatoes AND gravy...just mashed potatoes; gravy is listed separately and at additional cost. 

Really?"}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for a quick great tasting meal. The employees create a great family environment and make you feel at home. The Sweet tea, to die for!! They're fast with their service and always make things right."}
{"text":"I don't eat fast food so I'm super surprised that I am giving this 4 stars but for fast food when you are Drive thru eating this was good. It's real chicken breast and it was hot. I ordered the two piece chicken strips. The bbq sauce and dips are really good. Fries are the crinkly fries and a sweet roll. The sweet tea was very sweet and service was good. For fast food I can't complain and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the reviews are so poor overall. Sure, it's fast food. Sure, the drive-thru is weird. And I guess the flavor isn't bold. However, I've gone to this new location several times now and generally the chicken and sides were hot, fresh, and delicious. If you're expecting strong new flavors or a eat-in restaurant experience, you won't find it here. But if you're looking for something homey and satisfying on your way home, this is the place. Personally, I found the decidedly odd drive thru NOT confusing. If you actually pay attention, there are arrows and signs everywhere indicating where to wait. Additionally, you're free to leave when you get your food instead of waiting on a family of 6 ordering. The wait while paying after you get your food creates an opportunity to check your order (and perhaps buckle up, stick your straws in, and put your phone down before you get back on the road). I have not been held up once by any of this.

All that said, Bush's Chicken is definitely fast food and the sides range from amazing to mediocre on any given day. People seem to like the rolls but I find them kind of plastic-y and dry. Of all the times I've visited, one day seemed \"off\" and the freshness wasn't there in a big way. The crust is generally a perfect thickness and quite crispy, but isn't bursting with flavor. I appreciate that Bush's doesn't seem to be packing their meals with salt and grease, even if I need to go home and add a pinch of salt to the gravy. 

Overall, Bush's is good, but not great, but certainly not \"omg negative stars!!!\".Time will tell if Scottsdale is a marketable place for simple and decent fast food where you're not pressured to blast out of the drive-thru the moment you get your order."}
{"text":"I tried Bush's chicken for the first time last week. I ordered a breast, fries and okra and it came with bread. The fries were so so, the okra was so so, I didn't like the bread but really liked the fried chicken breast. It was very large, freshly cooked and tasted good.

The service was good and I was able to park right in front. I'll give 'em one more chance and see how they do."}
{"text":"So today was my second time there. First time was the week they opened I went through the drive through, its a really poor set up several lanes and car hops running out to see what you want. I got the chicken strips very bland. So now I decided to go again and get a family meal of tenders, still no taste no seasoning they give you packets, it was very crunchy with little grease
the green beans are horrible and there is no flavor in the gravy. Once again disappointed, so back to chick fa la for fast food chicken"}
{"text":"This new chicken finger trend found a fan...not for the chicken strips and gravy but for the gizzards... chicken gizzards or if you prefer livers a homestyle roll and gravy!!!
This is NOT health food... this is a splurge worthy crispety crunchety tasty treat... gravy as a dipping sauce??? Gravy trumps ranch style dressing!
Homestyle rolls are a fun change up to the biscuit
Get a huge drink, take an extra blood pressure pill because everything is adequately salted and enjoy this crispy nugget!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times I felt like the chicken wasn't browned properly. The coating was a light yellow color, not golden brown as one expects with fried chicken. 

I especially dislike the drive thru system. It is a discombobulated mess if I've ever seen one. Whomever was tasked with this should have to be repeatedly subjected to their own nightmare of a drive thru. It does not work and is enough to keep me going to Raising Cane's just past this about a mile on the north side of Bell Rd. 

I would be willing to offer 2 stars, but when I called to find out about baked or grilled chicken, the manager was honest in telling us it had to be ordered in advance because it took so long. Too bad he forgot to tell the kitchen to bake it so we still had to wait much longer than necessary. 1 star seems generous considering nothing was prepared as expected and our overall experience was one let down after another."}
{"text":"My husband and I walked in there for lunch and stood at the counter for 10 minutes. We were the only people in line. There were three young men working in there and only one acknowledged us. He kept saying be right with you. He never took our order so we just walked out. I guess we will give our business to a restaurant that wants it."}
{"text":"My first first visit was 3/23/17. Had too much crust, or over cooked. Forgot our rolls 10...must give another try.. \"Canes\" blows them away ... Then I'll yelp again."}
{"text":"The Good - They serve chicken gizzards and livers, customer service
The Bad - They need help with cooking Gizzards and Livers from places like Harold's in Chicago

My wife and I decided to give this place a whirl as it recently opened.  Before committing to an order, we decided to sample the items we wanted first.  Our first impression was that they overcooked the gizzards......big time.  I am a person who can eat some tougher items but these gizzards actually gave my jaws a workout.  It should NEVER take me more than 2 minutes to chew a chicken gizzard.  My wife tried the livers and they were overcooked as well.  When we ordered, we reminded them not to overcook the gizzards and livers.  They responded well but there was still quite a bit missing.  

As for the customer service, it was good but there needs to be some way to make it more efficient.  I could imagine waiting in a long line with the staff we had on our visit and it would seriously take a very long time.  The staff was friendly and accommodating but they need to take a page from Harold's in Chicago on how to cook chicken gizzards and livers."}
{"text":"Great bone-in fried chicken!  Love the fried chicken breasts and thighs, best I have had and way better than any other fast food chicken.  Tenders are good too, gravy is like home style creamy gravy you would get at a diner with fried chicken (not brown gravy), love the fried okra, and the sweet rolls top it all off perfectly.  Definitely the spot for fried chicken, and you can feed the whole family for about $25 or less!  Glad Bush's Chicken came to AZ!"}
{"text":"Now that's some good fried chicken!  I've been waiting a while for Bush's to open up here since I found out they were coming to Arizona, and they did not disappoint.  Best boned fried chicken I can remember ever having!  I also had to try the fried chicken livers and they were pretty good!  Really rich though.  That yeast roll was also delicious, I liked that much better than your traditional biscuit.  I can definitely see some tender rolls in my future!  I had the mashed potatoes and gravy, it's a white creamy gravy in the southern style and it was nice and flavorful.  I will be back to try the corn nuggets and fried okra for sure!  Everyone was extremely friendly, and the prices were great.  Really reasonable pricing especially on the family meals.  Meal quality for fast food was outstanding, Bush's Chicken has definitely earned my business!"}
{"text":"The food is OK. Sometimes it's good, some times it's really gross and not fresh what so ever. The employees answers to everything is \"I don't know\" so it's kinda hard to get any knowledge or good customer service out of any of them. They also take a long time to get your your food and cash you out. Very poor customer service- alright food. Pretty disappointed"}
{"text":"I hate to leave a bad review but i truly like their food however after waiting 30 minutes for our order the cashier tells us its going to be another 10 minutes for chicken to be cooked. I had to ask for a refund my kids were starving and i had family at home waiting on dinner. The assistant manager on duty did not even apologize or offer to make it up she gave me back the money ans said have a good night and walked away from the counter. I truly hope the upper management sees this and will try to correct the issue in their store."}
{"text":"I've never heard of this place but apparently, it's a big chain in Texas.  I live in the area and would pass by here often while it was under construction.  Last night was my first time trying it out.  I figured now was a good time as any.  I had coupons and quite a bit of time had passed since they first opened so hopefully all the kinks would be worked out.  The service was good and we were able to get our fairly big meal pretty fast.  We spent more time waiting at stop lights than having our food prepared for real.

We ordered the family tenders meal to take back to the house.  The tenders had a great crunchy texture but was really underwhelming in flavor.  It was pretty bland except for a hint of salt.  Hubby got the mac n cheese side and said it was too soupy for his liking and was disappointed.  The fries were fine but was nothing special.  I do like the rolls and gravy though.  The rolls were sweet like the King's Hawaiian bread but were much bigger.

This is a good place to go if you're looking for a cheap meal.  As far as chicken places go, there are better places within the same area... Raising Cane's for sure and Dairy Queen's chicken tenders are one of my favorites ever.  Sadly, I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I thoroughly have enjoyed this place every time I've visited. The staff is not as enthusiastic as you would think but that's ok. As long as you're not cussing or purposefully mishandling food unsafely I'm good. Everyone has bad days. I haven't brought myself to try many of the different items they offer as I always have a good meal with what I usually order. Chicken is good. Although last time I went it was just a tad bit pink. I didn't get sick and am still alive to write the review so it was fine. If you think the gravy or potatoes are bland then why not try some of the salt seasoning they give you mixed in with it. It's actually REALLY good! I would literally go out of my way now to go to Bush's and avoid raising canes at all costs. Much more calm experience and it doesn't feel like you're standing in the New York stock exchange like the other place."}
{"text":"The lower rating is for service not the food. The line has been steady since we walked in. 10 minutes in line behind 1 customer. Only one person on the register who was working her butt off while 7 or so employees were taking up 2 tables for the entire 30 plus minutes we were here.  None of them lifted a finger. The line is now 10 customers deep and they're still sitting there."}
{"text":"Finally it's open! When I heard Bush's Chicken was coming on the east side and close to my house, I couldn't wait. So today the wife and I tried this place out. First impression was nice and clean the how my employees they had  (that is to be expected, who wants to be short staffed for the new opening)! There were so many of them the kept running into each other. Anyway to the food. Service was fast, and served with a friendly smile. Food was hot which is really important, chicken was crispy and juicey, mashed potatoes were okay. The wife had the chicken tenders and cole slaw, she said the tenders were crispy which she liked and the cole slaw was go as well. Everyone won't like something in a new business, I hope they have success. Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Gravy dipping sauce and sweet tea is fantastic. Place is clean, general manager is very friendly. Everyone should try this place. Plus 3 drive thrus"}
{"text":"I had been anticipating wanting to eat here for quite awhile since the old Filiberto's building was demolished and the Bush's Chicken being built.  It's very close to work so I was looking forward to another good work option.

The second day it opened, I went there for lunch.  I was very disappointed.

1. The chicken has no seasoning, unless you consider salt to be a seasoning.  It's bland and does nothing for the taste buds.  But on the positive, the chicken isn't greasy and is cooked right.

2. I got the mashed potatoes and gravy.  The gravy they use is the white, salty flour gravy that is typically used in the south on biscuits for breakfast.  For mashed potatoes, I want meat gravy.  Very disappointed.

3. After ordering and getting my food, 4 people who work the same place as me come in to eat.  The manager greets them and tells them that everyone who works where I work gets 10% off their meal.  I then approached the manager and showed him my receipt and my work id badge.  He refused to give me my retroactive 10% discount from my order 5 minutes earlier.

Several other coworkers have also eaten there and have also agreed that the chicken is very bland.

I likely won't be eating there again as there are many better lunch options in the area."}
{"text":"I thought the chicken was tasty and wonderful. True southern fried chicken with fries and a roll about six bucks. This is the first store in Arizona really the first store outside of Texas. There are 80 of these restaurants in Texas. So if you're from Texas you know the amazing chicken they serve. If you like liver and gizzards, they have it."}
{"text":"Not bad its pretty much like churches , chicken is good, mac and cheese tastes pretty much the same as any other chicken place so its pretty much meh. The roll is good. Plus this place has RANCH!. Unlike the communist Canes around the corner. So pretty much would rather come to Bush's than Canes."}
{"text":"We stopped in to check it out. Got a 2 piece and a 3piece, both with biscuits. Can't speak for any sides. The biscuits were hot and fluffy, honey's on the table but no butter that we saw. The sodas are pre-made so they might be a bit watery at times, but mine was okay. GF had the half and half iced tea (half regular half sweet) which she really liked. 
The chicken is totally underseasoned. The 2 types of hot sauces on the table will be required as will the seasoning salt! I noticed they offer a bunch of dipping sauces which I figured were for the chicken strips - but I think they're necessary for the chicken too! The chicken was HOT temp wise even though they have mounds of it pre made under a heat lamp. Skin is super crispy but doesn't adhere to the meat at all. I peeled mine off and ate it separately. For what we paid there we could have walked over to Winco and bought 16 pieces of fried chicken and drinks that would have been just as good."}
{"text":"Only things that's worth it: the chicken Tuesday deal. I would not reccomend going any other day."}
{"text":"lots of chicken sitting ready, seem to take a long time to get my order, fries were cold, skimpy and just tiny little pieces, ordered livers and tenders, got gizzards and 2 drumsticks? place was empty, it wasn't like they were busy filling other orders so why the confusion? Guess I could also be petty and say I got a cup full of ice and very little soda. Not impressed at all. not sure how people can give this place more than 2 stars, the mcnuggets ad Mcdonalds are a better bet than this place. People please set your standers a little higher so we can all eat better food!"}
{"text":"Have been a few times just to grab a sweet tea for under $1.  This time I decided I would try the chicken.  Got the 4 piece tenders with roll and gravy.  The line took forever because of being short staffed and someone ordered enough chicken to feed a small army in front of me.  The tenders are big, the chicken was juicy and the breading was good and crispy. I think they just came out if the fryer!  The gravy is great for dipping and the little season packs are tasty on the tender.  The roll was nice and soft. I will definitely go back to try some sides and actual pieces of chicken."}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place the prices seemed good. I had heard about it from some Texas friends and they liked the ones back home.

I wasn't ready to completely commit so I got a tender sandwich. The roll was ok but the chicken was so cheery I couldn't bite through it. I threw it out and drove around the corner to canes. I won't go back to bushes."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place since it just opened up. We were very disappointed. The chicken was bland and forgettable. We got mashed potatoes as the side and they were not good. I have had better instant potatoes from the store. We threw them away. Only reason for two stars was the service was friendly. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"As they regularly mail coupons and they have some daily specials \"Tender Tuesday\", \"Wing Wednesday\" etc. I opt for Bush's when I need to feed a lot of people like the kids and their friends while everyone is out by the pool or if I'm doing a picnic type of thing. I can feed the whole damn fam for $20 if I opt out of drinks.

As for the chicken itself, it's always crispy and hot and because it's not over-seasoned it's perfect to drench in some hot sauce or whatever your specific jam is. They provide Texas Pete and it's pretty good on their chicken and their okra side. I always have a big bottle of Crystal at home and I love it on the mixed chicken or their tenders.

The gravy is also not over-seasoned but they give you their house season salt and you can make it as spicy as you like w some of that. 

Everyone loves the yeasty rolls from Bush's and on a recent Wing Wednesday stop (wings are $1 each and they're the three piece style, not just drumettes) the guy at the drive thru threw in a couple extra rolls for me after I told him my fam dig those so much. 

The side orders are about $4 for the family size sides but they are large portion sizes and I think priced right.  

I don't stop in very often but when I do everyone is nice, they answer all my questions, I get my food fast and there's usually some sort of discount or coupon available."}
{"text":"Had Bush's for the 1st time tonight and it will not be the last . The chicken was perfect juicy not greasy like the other 2 places we normally try . White gravy with hot dinner rolls excellent. So glad Glendale has finally got a descent Fried chicken place . Gonna try the Gizards next time"}
{"text":"Let's start with the negatives because sometimes there is a reasonable explanation for such things. Let's say you've never heard of this place (raises hand) but you spotted it driving by one day. It's not close-by but you think you'll try it out so you do the thing 99.3% of people would do before driving 10 miles to get there ... you log on to their website to look at the menu and check their hours.

But their menu doesn't really tell you what they sell. Sure it's chicken but there is no description of what it's like ... crispy, seasoned, baked, white/dark meat, etc. AND NO PRICES!!!!!

And no business hours either, only a heavy-handed pitch to sell franchises. And an offer to contact them if you want to know what they sell, how much they sell it for and what their hours are. Do you know how they want you to contact them? By E-MAIL!!!!!!

Okay right there I had a pretty bad impression of Bush's Chicken and almost ruled out going there. But I did go and almost immediately after I placed my order the General Manager came over to tell me that they had run out of white meat chicken and were cooking a new batch. Would I mind waiting?  I didn't mind so he and I chatted for a minute. I told him about the \"terrible\" website and he explained that since his store was so new the corporate office was still using a generic template website until they were able to customize one for his store. Oh!  So what appeared to be a serious negative was in fact no big problem at all. Moral? If you don't like their website, don't let that keep you away.

The rest comes down to how good is their service and how good is their food.

It's been so many years since I've stepped foot in a KFC I can't compare them and I've only been to Popeye's and Church's once. And neither Raising Cain nor Chick-fil-A sells on-the-bone fried chicken (and Pollo Loco is a Mexican specialty place). So my fried chicken \"standard\" lately unfortunately is either Albertsons deli or Banquet frozen fried chicken.

That being said you may have noticed that I rated this place 5-stars. Why? Several reasons. The chicken really is good. Unlike those other places that are pushing their \"flaked and formed\" nuggets or tenders, Bush's still sells real on-the-bone fried chicken, which is the #1 reason I came here. The pieces are tender, tasty, non-greasy and HUGE.  I like that it doesn't taste over-spiced like KFC or \"too\" crispy like so many other places. They seem to have the knack of making fried chicken down just right.

Other than that the place is clean, there are enough employees that it runs efficiently and they were all friendly and helpful. The GM apologized for our 12-minute wait and offered us a sweet tea while we were waiting (remember when McDonald's and Burger King used to do stuff like that if there would be a long wait?  These days they just shove you to the side and forget about you).

While for now this is my favorite fast food chicken place I caution that my 5-star rating is based on one experience only and that was for fried chicken and rolls only. I have not tried any of their sides nor other varieties of chicken. So I may have an updated opinion later on.  But for right now, I don't think you can go wrong if you are after a simple meal of old-fashioned fried chicken."}
{"text":"We went the first week it was opened. While most places have excuses during a grand opening, none needed for this place. The service was excellent and so was the food. I went in to eat but I did notice the drive up was moving fast as the servers went back and forth. The staff worked like a team to provide customers a no wait visit. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I'd never heard of this place until I drove past it earlier today. I decided to check it out because I love the idea of getting chicken at a fast food place for convenience but most chains suck if you want anything other than tenders. I walked in and checked out the menu for a bit before ordering a couple of tenders, chicken breast, mac n cheese and sweet tea. The tea was ok, nothing particularly great about it. The tenders were also pretty good but not much different than anywhere else. The mac n cheese was bad, took one bite and ditched it. The chicken breast and rolls on the other hand were amazing. I'd honestly say both were better than anything I've had at any fast food restaurant, ever. I'd make a trip back just to get the breasts and rolls, they're that good. 

They do have the new business awkwardness with the employees, but I'm sure that will work out with time. They had probably 3 employees for every customer when I was there and it seemed like they were almost tripping over each other. Give this place a shot but expect it to get better when they have the kinks worked out."}
{"text":"Drove by and looked like it was open.. Went back later. Looked at the menu seemed  pricey.. I'll take Cane's or Popeye's.. The place looked deserted both times.  We went for Chinese instead. Scottsdale Location"}
{"text":"The chicken is good but what set it apart was the ghost pepper sauce. Corporate got rid of it and now they dont serve it. I went out of my way to come here for that. The chicken in and of itself isnt enough to make me go oht of my way. Truley disappointing."}
{"text":"The customer service is great! The food not so much. Its very disgusting and bland. KFC's chicken and Popeye's chicken are better than this place. The chicken is hard,soft, and chewy all at the same time and it is extremely bland. It is not very moist either ans No seasonings at all. The gravy literally tastes like flour and milk. The fried okra is bland and slimy. If you have a sensitive stomach and cannot handle seasonings hey this is your place but not me. I figured I would give it a chance and I regret it. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Tried to give this place a try, but the chicken had absolutely NO flavor to it. it was rubbery and did not taste good at all.  I tried the mac and cheese and I am pretty sure it was made the week before... again, no taste at all. Didn't even taste like cheese.. not sure what the heck it was.  Probably the worst chicken / meal I have had in a LONG time :(  sorry. I really wanted to try them. it was so bad that I don't think there a chance of my second meal being any better."}
{"text":"Good chicken. Better than Church's and not greasy. The liver and gizzards are really tasty."}
{"text":"Had a great first time experience at Bush's chicken..the chicken was very fresh and delicious! Plenty of seating and the tables were kept clean..the staff was friendly and accommodating.  Fresh baked rolls were delectable and fried okra was very tasty however The side of mac and cheese was not worth mentioning..I will very likely be back at some point in the near future.."}
{"text":"Super solid chicken option!

I was craving some chicken and bread, so I decided to drive down to this Bush's and get some lunch.  I had been to the other Bush's on Bell (Glendale/Arrowhead) a handful of times, but this was my first time at this one.  Same shit for the most part.

I went through the drive thru (old school drive thru...you drive over a hose that alerts the works inside to come out, they take your order, put it in, get your money, bring your change, then bring your food.  Is it the most efficient way of doing this?  Probably not, but, it works for them and is somewhat unique.) and placed my order for 2 tender rolls and an order of fries.  My order was barely over $5.00.  I pulled into a parking spot to grub.  Here is how it was..................

Tender Roll-  This is pretty straight forward.  It is one of their yeast rolls, sliced open with a chicken strip inside.  Simple, cheap ($1.50) and delicious.  I doctored mine up with some honey, and went to town.  These things are great!  The rolls is nice and soft and has a great yeast flavor to it.  The chicken is seasoned properly, crunchy and moist in the inside.  I have had some inconsistent sized tenders from Bush's before, but today, both of mine were rather large tenders.  2 is the perfect serving size if you get another side, or if you are just eating tender rolls, I would get 3 of them.  

Fries-  I got an order of fries as my side.  Bush's uses crinkle cut fries.  The fries today were just ok.  They could have been fried a bit longer and a bit more crispy.  They were still alright though, and served their purpose. 

Service at the drive thru was friendly.  I will definitely be back to Bush's.  This particular one is close to work (closer than the other one on Bell), and it's easy to get to.  3 tender rolls, or 2 tender rolls and a side are just around $5.00. Filling enough, and cheap! Can't beat that!  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars!

I had seen this place a few weeks back while driving home down Bell Rd.  Bush's?  What the hell is Bush's Chicken?  Never heard of it!  Well.....  One of my coworkers tried it within a few days after opening, and a couple of other coworkers tried it, too.  The first one was not impressed, but the other 2 thought it was great.  I had to check it out for myself.  I'm down with chicken spots like Popeye's, Church's etc. and choose those over other fast food options, often.

We were going to be in the neighborhood (Had to go to Costco) on Sunday, so we decided to stop by.  We parked, walked in and were immediately greeted.  My wife and kids grabbed a table, and I placed the order for our food.  We went with a 6 piece strip meal with mashed potatoes and gravy, a 2 piece chicken meal (both breasts) with mashed potatoes and gravy, and a cinnamon apple pie for dessert.  Total was just under $20.00.  They gather your order right then and there, fill your first cup of soda for you, and you take your tray back to your table.  Everything looked delicious.  Here is how everything was............

6 Piece Strip Meal ($8.99)-  This was a fat plate of food!  It came with 6 chicken strips, a nice huge scoop of mashed potatoes and gravy, a roll, and a side container of gravy.  I also ordered 2 dipping sauces (Bbq and honey mustard $.25 and $.29 cents each.  The only sort of chincy thing about this visit.  They should give you 1 or 2 sauces for free, then charge for additional ones...not just charge you for sauce.  Anyways...kind of like Ted's Hot Dogs $.25 cent soda refill.  They don't really need to charge and I guarantee they are making enough money to not have to do it.  Anyways........just a side rant.  The sauces were tasty, at least).  The chicken tenders have a nice light batter on them.  Crunchy, and crispy, moist inside and very easy to bite through.  The chicken was seasoned perfectly!  I liked these strips better than Popeye's and Church's strips.  Very, very similar in look, but Bush's were seasoned just a bit better.  Sometimes Popeye's and Church's strips are kind of bland. Anyways.... the scoop of mashed potatoes was piping hot and tasty.  They may be powdered potatoes, but they were damn tasty. I prefer Popeye's gravy over Bush's, but it was still a damn fine mashed potato side and I would get them again.  The roll was large, nice and soft, and I dipped it in the side of gravy.  This combo also came with a large drink (Coke products).  

2 Piece Breast Meal ($7.19)-  Once again, a fat plate of food!  This plate came with 2 huge chicken breasts, a fat scoop of mashed potatoes, and a roll (no side of gravy).  The breasts were coated perfectly in a light but crispy coating.  Same as the strips, the chicken was seasoned perfectly and the chicken was cooked perfectly in the middle.  I may have preferred the breasts over the strips.  Hell of a deal for around $7.00 including a large drink!  They use crushed ice, too.  Makes your drink ice cold, really fast, and is fun to chew on once you are done.  Not a lot of places use crushed ice anymore! (It might seem stupid to point that out, but I noticed it right away and was happy to see it!)

Cinnamon Apple Pie ($.99)- Well....about this one.  My son had a few bites and kept trying to grab it from the table.  I wanted to have some of it so I placed it in the corner of my tray for later.  Turns out that we got busy and distracted (2 kids will do that to you!), and I took my tray to throw away some trash.....Yup, the rest of the apple pie went in the trash.  Realized it 2 seconds after I dumped the tray.  Lame!  I can say that the pie at least looked good (like a McDonalds apple pie) and my son seemed to enjoy his 3 bites of it.  I'll have to get another one next time I come back.

Overall, I was impressed!  My wife LOVES chicken strips/breasts, so this was right up her alley.  She had the same feelings about the meal as I did...it was pretty damn tasty!  Service was incredibly friendly and fast and the price was decent for the amount of food you get.  I know 100% sure we will be back sooner than later.  Glad to have Bush's in Arizona.  I went from never hearing of the joint, to instantly falling in love with it.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I was hyped about trying bush's but their chicken is like very battered fried skin. Overall I feel like they're a knock off of KFC."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Bush's Chicken. I was hoping it would be a better version of Raising Cane's but instead it was a lesser version of KFC. 

We walked in and were welcomed with a pungent oily greasy smell that was off-putting. We were the only ones in line and were not greeted by anyone for the 5+ minutes we were looking at the menu. 

The prices weren't bad but the gizzard meals on the menu mixed with the awful smell made us walk out and not eat here. I have no desire to go back."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! I was greeted by Shikura as soon as I walked in. She was very courteous and helpful. 

Once their rush was done, I heard the manager say to his staff, \"good job everyone!\" That really made my day. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Very disappointing! We were excited to try this new place in Gilbert. But sorry to say the coating on the chicken breast was bland and had no flavor. It was very moist..just no flavor.....we expected something similar to Raising Canes....but no such luck.....it was also poorly run and unorganized as they had a long line and it seemed understaffed for lunch time......

My wife did give a 'two thumbs' up on the coleslaw.....very tasty!

Sorry Bush's...we won't be back!"}
{"text":"Place is clean staff is friendly. Food blah no taste chicken. The rolls are good. Went in at lunch time got chicken tenders the 6pc seems like chicken was sitting under the heat lamp for a while. Dried out. I ate half threw the rest away. Cole slaw wasn't bad. Just because of the rolls and friendly staff I'll probably give another shoot but went be craving anytime soon."}
{"text":"It's your typical fried chicken. I got the two piece meal and it was super greasy. I could taste the fried gizzards they make in the oil. The biscuit was Delish and tasted homemade. The mashed potatoes tasted like box potatoes and the gravy was peppery and just plain white gravy. The sweet tea was good. The kids got fries and tenders but they said they rather go to canes . Overall it's a fried chicken place. Staff were nice."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!    Customer service is non existing. ..the so called mgr...just wants to argue...HOW CAN A CHICKEN REST. BE OUT OF THEIGHS???...GAVE US wrong pieces....bad food"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time today because we wanted to try the chicken liver and guizzards.  The liver was very dry and the gizzards were so tough we couldn't even bite thru them. We had to throw them away.  The cup of gravy that was served with them looked like wall paper paste and i would bet wall paper paste would have more taste.  We will not waste our time and money to go back."}
{"text":"Chicken crusts all over the floor in the dining area. The chicken was so salty it wasn't edible. I had high hopes for this place but the dead parking lot says a lot. My tongue is still burning from all the salt.  Staff stands around doing nothing when the place is dead. Even for fast food... sometimes managers will walk around and ask how everything was. Not this place. Sooo salty. Blah."}
{"text":"We were so excited to see that there was a Bush's here after we were spoiled to it living in Texas. They were super busy and it was evident that the manager was trying his hardest to please everyone! Contrary to the negative post about wait time, I will still rate them a 5 as they were very friendly, apologetic and accommodating! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service is quick, the price is fair, and the chicken is juicy and crispy and hot! The gravy is peppery and savory and the biscuits are more of a butter roll, but equally delicious. Great family meals or late night munchies, we just got back from the DBacks game and devoured our food, it really hit the spot!!! So good!"}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to checking this place out. Unfortunately I was rather disappointed. I had no issues with service, and the prices are good....but the food was seriously lacking in my opinion. We got the family meal with rolls and 2 sides. We chose corn on the cob, and mac-n-cheese.
The chicken itself wasn't bad, but wasn't great. Didn't really stand out, but was edible. The corn was completely water-logged and flavorless, and the mac-n-cheese I am sad to say was rather blah. The rolls on the other hand were pretty decent. Probably everyone's favorite part!
I don't think we will be back, at least not for a while. Next time I'm craving fried chicken, I'll drive a couple miles in the other direction for KFC. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time!
 Would give negative stars. Food is awful. Not sure how this chain keeps opening locations. The food is really bad! Tastes like a frozen dinner. Looks like old grey rotting meat. The chicken at Albertsons across the street is 10times better. Gravy has no flavor. Fries are basic. Literally every other chicken place & grocery store chicken is better. Bush's won't last long. There's many other option around. LoLo's is walking distance from Bush's and they have gizzards, just sayin'.
 The food isn't even the worst part! The only fast food place I've ever seen where you pay when YOU PICK UP the food. Yes, you order and don't pay. You pay when pick up your tray. This causes so much confusion and makes the whole process take a lot longer than it needs to. You don't have access to the teas. You have to take your cup to the person working drive thru to get tea.  
 The rolls are good."}
{"text":"Worst Chicken I have ever had
Should have picked up frozen Banquet 
The livers we supposed to be eight
Instead on large gross old clump
And I should have ran out when it took
Three times to get the order fight
I ordered 8 livers
And 8 pieces of chicken
How could you mess that up?
The biscuit old and stale 

Stay a way and they will go away"}
{"text":"I have only been to the new location in Scottsdale- happily it's just down the street from me and they will be seeing me often - great fried chicken, reminds me of Browns chicken that used to be popular in Chicago - friendly order takers that come out to your car and quick service - I was kind of disappointed with the macaroni and cheese, but will just stick to fries as my side - definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Update as of 10.9.17, 5.30PM (Dinner rush)

When this place opened, the lines were out the door, until the employees started treating customers poorly. Update today:  As of 6.20pm, the drive thru has 2 cars, compared to 4 lanes of 5-6 cars deep per line.

Inside is worse:
Every table used to be taken, with a line out the door. Every night.

Tonight: 2 Tables. Cold, burnt rolls. Old Sweet tea the consistency of syrup. And chicken size cut in half to KFC size.

I asked the employee if they cut the size of their chicken, and he said \"oh yes - and we've had nothing but customer complaints\".

Such potential here, but this lackluster company appears to attract lackluster franchisees. Here's our receipt:"}
{"text":"This was our very first time here. GREAT customer service from the owner FRANK. He greeted us with a trainee. We got a mom and pop restaurant service at a drive through. Can't beat That! Food is delicious!!! We ordered just about everything. I have to say that besides the chicken our favorites are the rolls, gravy,  gizzards and pie. Thank you Frank for the awesome customer service and delicious food. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"While on our way to Raising Canes one day,  we made a split decision to try this new place that opened. 

The food is delicious,  the best fried chicken out there. Their southern homestyle sides are incredible and their portions are excellent. Don't even get me started on the rolls (sooooo good) 

The staff are very friendly and enjoyable to talk to. 

We've been back a number of times since and plan to often."}
{"text":"Yum!  The chicken and gravy is really good.  And the mashed potatoes are even better.  My husband is in love with their sweet tea.  As far as chicken fast food, this place is the tops!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try a new chicken place in town, but was really disappointed.  The quality of all the food here is just not there, it's nothing special.  Just about any other place is better than this."}
{"text":"Giving a 2 Star only because the customer service is decent. I love friend chicken but I'd rather go to Popeyes and at least get some flavor. The batter they use for the chicken is also odd... Rolls were good and so were the fries but that was it."}
{"text":"I love Bush's chicken, I am from Texas and when I found out they had a location near me, I had to go! One thing I did not lie was, I pulled up and the server, took someone  the order of someone who go there after me. After I mentioned it to him, he got my order correct and the food was hot! It was so good, reminds me of the Bush's in Waco, TX and Missouri City! 

Also, the location is great and they seem to keep it clean!"}
{"text":"Went once b/c of promo & was bland & tasteless. Heard good things about the concept & was gonna try again but closed--guess I know why..."}
{"text":"Greasy, mediocre fried chicken. White gravy lacks favor. Chicken strips were a tad better than the bone-in chicken but had too much breading. Rolls were soft, warm and tasty, sadly the best part of the meal. Mac and cheese was meh...
My first visit here and it's doubtful I'll return."}
{"text":"It was good... Reminds me of the other chicken place without the special sauce.   I had the chicken tenders which are really crispy and I love that... Had mash potatoes and gravy with the roll. The roll was very good and soft. The gravy is a typical white gravy.. Which I like. I'll have to try the actual chicken next time. Service was good, place was clean... Staff friendly... I'd go back."}
{"text":"Like the chicken and omg the bread is amazing. Would have given more stars except I went there today (2nd time ever) and went through drive through. Ordered almost $40 worth of food and tried my best to check the accuracy but a bag and the packaging are not easy to check. After my 30 minute drive home I found I was shorted food. Tried to call the number on the receipt but it just rings and rings and rings. Nobody picks up. Website has no way to context them outside of Facebook and twitter and mailing something to Texas. Disappointed. Won't do drive through there again."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, about two weeks ago, I got here as they were closing. They were overloaded with customers, and focused on taking care of everyone. The manager Frank, and one of his employees Jesus, were outstanding despite all the customers that they were dealing with. Even though it took a while to get my order, it was well worth the wait. Five stars and two thumbs up for customer service and delicious food. Back again today for another order."}
{"text":"Did the \"drive-thru\" ordered a #2 (2 piece w/ a side, roll & large drink) I upgraded to get a breast piece for .70, which was a huge piece. The entire meal was just blah. No seasoning on the fried chicken; however it was crispy. Didn't get any plastic ware to eat the mashed potatoes, gravy was just okay. People raved about the sweet, yeast roll, there was nothing sweet about it & no butter. The tea was the best part, but I've had better.  I prefer Popeye's over here, but I might go back to try the chicken strips and another side."}
{"text":"Going to start out with 3 stars and maybe 4 the next time. 
The place is clean and everyone is friendly. 
Hey it's chicken. I do like the coating or breading as it is not so thick it hides the taste of the chicken. I do wish they did a grilled variety. If they had grilled I would be there much more often as I try to cut as many carbs from my food as possible."}
