{"text":"Stella's is cute and small, with a hidden side seating area that reminds me of a cross between your grandma's and some hipster's living room.  We went in today for the first time since didn't have time to make coffee before leaving the house.  Their Americanos were reasonability priced ($4.20 all in for 2) and GOOOOOOOD!  If you're in the neighbourhood and want a coffee, go to Stella's."}
{"text":"you toronto poseurs are such a joke!

especially the reviewer comparing this place to a Parisienne cafe. I guess this little girl watches a lot of pretentious movies. I live there half the year. trust me, it's nowhere near the same, especially the pastries!! what a joke...

The food is ok, not really fresh

The \"croissants\" ar frozen things they buy offsite and heat up, often poorly

the \"bacon\" in the chicken sandwich comes from a pre made batch, like the kind you reheat, from a store.

i give it 2 stars for being better than McDonalds at least, but you trendy idiots make me sick. 

every weekend it's full of bloody parents and strollers.

ugh!

Paris awaits, and beckons! I can't wait to leave this wannabe city"}
{"text":"Stella's lunchbox is the \"little kid sister\" to Desotos (same owner).  Highlights include a relaxed vibe, great music (either jazz or indie rock depending on who is working), amazing breakfast pastries (my current favorite is the apple galette), tasty panini sandwiches, and solid expresso drinks.  I have always found the service to be top notch and friendly. Whether you need a place to hide and work on your laptop (they have free wifi, just ask for the password) or grab a quick lunch and/or coffee with friends, Stella's is perfect.  The only thing I have found lacking at Stella's is a lack of power outlets...but upon my last visit I discovered they installed a new power bar with six sockets, upping my rating from a 4 to a 5 star!"}
{"text":"I go there pretty much at least once a month! that is enough to know that I like it. it is kind of eclectic type of crowd. I like thier crumbled egg with cheese (just remind them to take the bacon out if you are vegetarian) . in summer it is even quieter outside than inside.

Pro: food is good and fresh. service is good, staff is friendly, prices are reasonable.
Con: Parking ! street parking just in front of it is free, but you would be really lucky to find a spot. other wise you have to park on St Claire which is also not easy and the two machines are defect for over 2 months now. but that has nothing to do with the cafe."}
{"text":"I don't know who Stella is, but I feel like I've sat in her living room and had coffee on her patio. Stella's is an ABSOLUTE gem right off of St. Clair W. The inside looks like a comfy, but hip living room with a fabulous coffee bar staffed by the friendliest of people. There's long worn wooden table for larger groups or getting to know your neighbours. The patio is tiny, but quaint. I feel like I'm sitting at a quiet Parisienne cafe. 

The boy and I shared a delicious grilled veggie panini and had a coffee each. The eggplant, zucchini and red pepper had a nice char, and still has good bite to it. The coffees were delicious and smooth. Our sweet tooth wasn't  aching that day, but if it was, there were delicious raspberry scones and mini chocolates to remedy that at anytime. 

I have a feeling this will become my local coffee haunt. So if you're in the area, come visit Stella and I'll probably be there too!"}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to hang out here.  Terrific food, lovely staff, a nice layout with room for everyone.  Very cozy.  A good menu as their kitchen is shared with the restaurant next door.  Nice wide windows which will be very nice in the summer, a patio outside.  Just around the corner from St. Clair St."}
{"text":"This place looks really lovely and is unique to the Oakwood side of St clair west. The decor is inviting and warm. The food and service however, are a hit and miss. Ive had one really great crispy buttery delicious sandwich, and one soggy undercooked sandwich.. The server (tall guy with redish hair) doesn't seem to give a flying rats ass about you. If you ask him how hes doing, he'll answer you with \" good.\" and then look away... He's very aloof and slightly aggressive. He practically threw my tiny soggy sandwich at my after waiting 15 minutes.. The prices are a bit high as well. If my sandwich was crispy and buttery and delicious and hot, I wouldn't mind paying 12 dollars for it with a tiny americano. But Soggy, cold, and small served by an grown up toddler aint my thing.  Maybe the quality of the sandwich depends on his mood. If thats what they're going for then there should be a mood scale on the wall.  Or maybe they should hire someone who cares because this place has a lot of potential that is right now being chewed up and spat out by some dink. I hope Stella eventually rethinks who is representing her sweet cozy brand."}

{"text":"My go to for a quiet cafe to work at. Americano's are great. Panini's (especially the vegetarian) are delicious though a bit pricey. Their pastries are fresh from the kitchen - which is shared with the great DeSotos restaurant next door. You must try the cheesecake. This cafe is named after the owners daughter, she is delightful and whenever she is around really makes the space feel special."}
