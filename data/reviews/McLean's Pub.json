{"text":"Love this place, 

I come by a lot after work with my friends. Incredible staff always friendly. Good food and good drink selection. Happy Hour rocks!"}
{"text":"Great environment. First time in Montreal. Had Judy as my bartender and she was super nice. I wanted something to munch on and would've gotten the poutine but had it somewhere else earlier today. I got the drunkin mushrooms instead (which Judy suggested) and they were awesome.  First time ever having Alexander Keith's red amber ale and had to have seconds. If I happen to visit Montreal again definitely stopping for a drink."}
{"text":"Hopped off the hoho bus today to have a bite of lunch and ordered the open face Rueben. Sorry, was really unimpressed!  The fries looked and tasted as if they had been cooked yesterday and just now warmed up, and the Rueben the same. Ok, it was the special and maybe they made up a couple dozen before they opened to beat the rush. Anyway, if you eat here, don't order the special."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of poutine in Canada, but that was the best. Get it with smoked meat. Good food, good beer and great service."}
{"text":"It was all basic downtown dog s*** . They advertised as a place to watch soccer games but the most important game of the weekend was on and they were playing preseason American football that no one was watching. The waiter was lazy didn't bring any napkins, or utensils or salt and pepper,  then charged my friend for a drink that he didn't get. I'd say never again don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Nice place for a burger and quaff.  Good food and service just off Rue St. Catherine.  OK for lunch or dinner.  We have kids and were only allowed to sit outside, which turned out just fine.  Very pricey for what you get though.  2 burgers, 2 chicken tender baskets and 4 beers set us back $100 + tip."}
{"text":"I went with my boyfriend for a beer and we had to wait almost 20 minutes for the bartender to take the order when she was not busy at all (She was taking about how amazing was her halloween custom and showing to the other bartender how she had a tail in her custom). Very rude bartenders not paying attention to customers."}
{"text":"Oh McLeans is the place, 
where the Jameson we chase 
with a pint of cold Guiness Beer

Where Kenny Mac is the the star, 
standing behind the bar
he's the best booze slinger by far

Oh and on Sunday at noon,
I'll be there to lick last night's wounds,

With a Bacon Cesear in hand 
(once you've had one you'll understand)
McLeans Pub will have you doing a headstand....

or an Irish jig, or the moonwalk, maybe a riverdance.

Either way, you should go.  The staff is great and uber friendly and the food is tasty.  But above all go for the laughs...and the beer of course don't forget the beer.  

Does Whiskey count as Beer?

{"text":"I've never posted a review on these kinds of sites before, but after last night's service I kind of felt compelled. Decided to grab a quick pint with a group of four, and McLean's was closest and the least busy in the area.

I should preface this by saying that I'm partial to older/dirtier/cheaper bars, so the atmosphere, grimy tables, and televisions that were set to a volume that made the chair next to me bleed didn't bother me in the slightest. I had been there once before; I knew what I was getting in to.

My issue was being made to wait for half an hour for less than an ounce of whiskey. I would have gladly gone up to the bar and ordered it myself if it weren't for the fact that the waitress promptly disappeared after taking our order (she could sometimes be seen behind the bar or chatting with regulars before once again slipping into the back).

When our drinks finally came, they were watered down and lukewarm. Even with the ice melted into my drink, it was barely two sips until the glass was empty. Then came the bill: A whopping $9.50 for a child sized whiskey, despite the fact the menu stated that premium liquor was $6.04. Before I could ask the waitress about it, she curtly said 'thanks guys' and disappeared again.   

Tl;dr: Terrible service, watered-down drinks, and exorbitant prices= A bad time."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere are better than the average pub. Service is less than friendly. Prices are slightly high."}
{"text":"Do you speak English (only)? Like to drink? In Montreal? GO HERE. 

Bar staff is EXTREMELY friendly. Locals are good. as well. You WILL get into a conversation if you sit at the bar. 

Good happy hour as well. As an anglo - this was my favorite bar in the city."}
{"text":"Started out well, but our server ignored us the entire night because she had a group of men come in that apparently were more important. Food was not that great either."}
{"text":"Generic downtown Irish Pub. Decent food and beer selection. Beer is also available by the \"tower,\" so that's fun. Perfectly fine place for a pint and a bite, or to watch the game, if you're into that kind of thing."}
{"text":"I was also in the group of four from the below review. The service was beyond absurd. Ordering four drinks in a pub that is moderately busy shouldn't take over half an hour. Our 'waitress' took 15 minutes of that to even come and greet the table. 

After ordering we sat and watched new customers come in and sit at the bar, promptly receiving service and drinks. All the while, our waitress would stand at the bar and drink her own drink, watch the football game or just completely disappear into the back. At first, I thought she was waiting on the bar, but the bartender wasn't busy, as he spent most of his time standing and talking. 

Finally our drinks came. The whiskey was an issue, plus the cider was flat and tasted horrible. Alas, the waitress was nowhere to be seen for over 10 minutes and by the time she re-appeared, we were ready for our bill and wanted to leave.

The staff here seems to be lacking training and some sort of management. I can't believe a table of four, who would have stayed for more drinks, can't get more than one round in 45 minutes. The entire staff seemed more interested in socializing with each other and watching tv than any kind of service.

If I'm going to spend 8.50 on a beer, I'll be going somewhere that I can at least get more than one, and won't taste like the keg isn't cold and a couple months past it's expiry."}
{"text":"Pub vraiment très sympa : le cadre est superbe, tout en bois avec lumières tamisées comme dans un bon pub; la musique rétro colle parfaitement sans être trop basse ni trop forte; les serveurs sont très aimables et au petits soins même s'il y a du monde ! Je le recommande vivement !
La carte est variée et surprenante pour des prix très abordables, on reviendra c'est sûr !"}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for work and I was introduced to McLean's by a friend. It was worth every dollar spent. Good food, great service and good atmosphere. I look forward to stopping by on my next trip."}
{"text":"Pub irlandais correct, qui a un peu perdu de son charme depuis quelques années. Le fish & chips est bien, il y a de la Guinness, bref, on peut passer un bon moment à cet endroit. J'aime bien aussi les serveuses, qui, la dernière fois que j'y suis allé, avaient toutes l'air d'approcher l'âge de la retraite et même davantage, malgré leur probable trentaine réelle. Ça apporte un petit cachet supplémentaire quelque peu cocasse."}
{"text":"The service was quick when we ordered our first drinks. Then after that things went south. The blonde bar maid ignored us the whole time. We tried multiple times to reorder drinks then tried to wave and get her attention 3+ times to pay our tab.  She seemed more interested in talking to 3 other patrons or her friends idk. Every time she took an order she would head their direction and have some kind of convo. She attended to the walk ins next to us quickly and ignored that our glasses were empty. It was then we left cash and walked out the door. Then SHE GOT LEGS and accused us of not paying our tabs. We proceeded to go back in and pay whatever she said we owed her. I admire the kindness the Montreal but I guess there's a bad egg in every bar. Cool bar , great atmosphere but the service was so unsatisfactory. I realize people leave reviews if 1 service was bad or really good. Spend your money elsewhere.

Review update - the manager messaged me and agreed with my review. He offered to make it right and invited me back to his business. Thanks for taking the time and respecting my opinion. I will give it another try when I return to Montreal."}
{"text":"We literally lived here yesterday as it was the first bar on NYE that didn't have a line or crowd. We watched the U.S. Vs Canada game (Canada won) and had some Labatt towers and poutine. We even got 4 free tickets to Germany vs Finland game! Really cool place with great service. The food was just ok. 

We also rang in the new year here. You get free Jameson shot at midnight!"}
{"text":"Came here to meet a very old friend. Their beer was on special and tasted alright.

I had the 007 burger, and it was really delicious. The service was great, and the food was alright. We came in an afternoon so the place was not very crowded and was very clean. A typical Irish bar one can enjoy in a Friday night."}
{"text":"Classically good Irish pub with very good poutine.  Come here after a long day walking the city for some good 20oz pints and lovely poutine and sports."}
{"text":"Went up to Montreal for the weekend with a group of friends recently, and we wound up at McLean's. Here we were, a group of Bruins fans wearing Bruins Stanley Cup Championship gear, rolling up in a Montreal pub looking to have a few beers. Jacqueline was fast, friendly and made sure we were having a great time.The rest of the staff were equally so, which surprised me a bit. We traded barbs over the Bruins/Habs rivalry with the owner/manager and a bouncer, ended up staying there for a few hours and got a free beer tower (score!!). Next night, a smaller group went back after dinner and Jacqueline was the bartender. She and the owner/manager remembered us from the night before and chatted with us for the few hours we were there. There was a steady stream of people. Despite this, everyone's drinks remained full and all of the staff took time to chat with all the customers, including our group of out-of-towners.

Overall, the staff was extremely friendly, the drinks were priced very well and the atmosphere was exactly what you'd want in a traditional Irish pub. They even had a bunch of suggestions on where to go for breakfast the next morning and what else we should do while in Montreal. The fact that a group of guys wearing Bruins gear could roll up in this place and get such a warm reception is indicative of the kind of atmosphere here. Forget Cheers, McLean's is REALLY the place where everybody knows your name. This is my #1 stop next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"We headed here for the Habs-Leafs game on Feb 11, 2012. Joel is a hardcore Habs fan and I'm a Leafs-lover.

The atmosphere at this place is pretty awesome. Very down to earth. They had a hockey pub quiz thing going on during the hockey game intermissions and gave away little prizes (hats, t-shirts, $15 gift certificates). The emcee was part comedian, part announcer -- very entertaining (even for me, the ONLY Leafs fan in the room). The waittress was super-friendly and fast.

They have several very large TV's and there really isn't a bad seat in the house. I did find it a little loud for my taste, but after a few drinks you don't notice it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, the place is nice and well kept.
The major issue is their limited beer options. It seems that the place is sponsored by the Budweiser group (Anhauser-Bush) and it only serves their crappy beers. So beer lovers look elsewhere you won't find good beer here. So disappointing! !!!"}
{"text":"Open late on weeknights and at a convenient location. Had a few beers (which were a great value, might I add), an order of poutine, and an order of fried mushrooms. I wouldn't really come here for food because it was super greasy and overpriced for pub snacks, but for a weeknight pint this place is fine. They have huge beer tubes that you can order for the table, which looked like a lot of fun."}
{"text":"This is my kind of place - a good old fashioned pub. Lot's of TV's for sports. Great atmosphere for a Habs game (even if your not a Habs fan). Broad mix of people including students, suits, retirees - both male and female. People are friendly, you will likely make some new friends. No worries if your out of town, the staff speak English and many of the patrons here do as well. I would say the food is above average for a beer pub - fries, burgers, sandwiches etc... I started going here as a student so it brings back many fond memories from15-20 years ago. They did some renovations but the place feels the same. It's located in the heart of downtown Montreal. If you in town, this is a great place to hang out and have some fun."}
{"text":"Dropped in at McLean's pub on new year's eve to grab a bite before getting ready to go out for the night. 

I can't comment on the menu as they had a special menu on NYE. We all had poutine and beer and it was fantastic. Even though they didn't use the right kind of cheese, it was stringy when melted but not the the type of \"squeaky\" cheese you're supposed to use in a real poutine, the sauce and the fries made up for it. It hit the spot just like I wanted.

They have a lot of beers on tap, including my favourite, Kilkenny and you can order beer towers (a.k.a. giraffe). The coolest part is probably the new electronic self tap tables upstairs. They only have 3 I believe but it's a cool concept that I haven't seen elsewhere.

Definitely stop by if you're in the Peel & Ste-Cat area."}
{"text":"Great place to go with a group of friends! Seems to be much more spacious than the average bar in the Montreal!"}
{"text":"I checked the google reviews and decided to try this place after a movie at the Bank of Scotia theater.  It's just half block away.  
Whoever says Le Vieux Dublin Club is super noisy, should have checked this place first.  Very noisy with very bad music with very bad speakers, that's make it worse than anything.  How much bad music?  Iri-shy kind music first, shakeshakeshake second, bagpipe third and Thriller the last after the 4 combination-, we left.  
We tried Guinness - It was perfectly poured! yummy- lukewarm wings with soggy fries and no smiling grumpy server.  2 star for the location and Guinness..."}
{"text":"McLean's has been the group \"watering hole\" for my friends and I for the past several years.
From the casual nights of them playing quarters or celebrating birthdays or foolishly ordering a second 10L tower or getting some freestyle rap from our waitress (shoutout to Adrienne she can drop some serious fire) it's always a good time.

The only thing holding me back from giving it that 5/5 is that some of the food is a miss while others are quite good.

The alldressed pizza offered on on Hockey nights during habs games is my go to at this point. The wings are a good alternative - I've had the honey garlic though. 

The big point of contention has to be the nachos. It's gotten to the point where even La Cage does em better. :(

That being said that won't stop me from going to McLeans, but I would certainly like to give them that last star."}
{"text":"J'aime bien cet endroit. Moins bondé de monde que le Peel pub juste à côté, le service est courtois et les prix sont corrects. La bouffe est pas mal non plus. C'est de la bouffe de pub, on s'entend, mais ça fait la job. Bonne sélection de bières et de scotchs. J'aime l'ambiance et le look général de la place. Ils gagnent des points pour la fois où j'ai oublié mon sac avec mon Ipod dedans (l'histoire de ma vie) et que j'ai pu aller récupérer le tout le matin à l'ouverture et constater que tout étant encore à l'intérieur... merci madame la serveuse!"}
{"text":"Location: On Peel below Ste. Catherine. The closest subway is Peel and street parking [metered] is limited. 

The place: One big, brown space. They also have a nicely sized terrace, which is the place to be when the weather is good. 

The goods: I only stopped by for a quick drink, and went for the white Sangria. It was tasty and refreshing on a rather hot, summer day. No complaints. You can order by the glass, or order a pitcher. 

Service: Good.

Price point: One Sangria was $7.50."}
{"text":"Un vrai pub comme on aime, avec beaucoup de charme et de caractère, très bien situé à 2 pas du métro Peel!
Excellent service, excellent menu, happy hour de 4 à 8 sur un large choix de bières, avec des pintes à 5$ et des pichets à 12! Que demander de plus!!
Les nachos tex mex sont bonnes, assez épicées quand même!
A essayer!! :)"}
{"text":"Came by for a quick 5-7 drink. It's a cool place, very spacious, quick service, giant beer bucks. 

I ordered the onion rings to share with my boyfriend and although the portion was generous, the onion rings weren't good. Very soft and tasteless.

It could be a cool place to meet up with friends and have a drink. Might come back and try some other food."}
{"text":"For anyone who hasn't been here you need to stop by. Great staff, good vibe. Try the butter chicken pizza! Its a flavor explosion. There is Typical Irish and French favorites with all the Poutines you'll ever need. Bar tender Kenny will take good care of you! 
Whoever gave this place less than 4 stars must be a grumpy person."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were not bad. Not much options for cocktails. Ambiance and music was good."}
{"text":"'Twas the morning on the 20th of January 2018, I was here for the Bruins vs Canadians game and I said to myself I fancy a libation and so it happened that I stumbled into this gallant establishment. Ye and verily I met Kenny, the future best man at my wedding for he not only makes the best tasting drinks but also can spin a fine yarn of tales that will regale the most boring of men into a talkative connoisseur of many tastes. In conclusion this place is the feckin balls kehd."}
{"text":"Came here all the way from New Jersey on St. Patrick's day and had a great time. The wait time was decent (though felt like 4 hours because it was freezing). There was a live band that played well and the service was good for a crowded pub. We ordered the largest beer they had which cost us around $115usd but was completely worth it. Not only did we look completely badass but it was enough for four guests and more. Overall, great night."}
{"text":"Had an alright time. Loud/rowdy dudes. Nice servers. Made picklebacks."}
{"text":"Not a clean place, at least my table top wasn't. I also received an unrequested bowel cleansing later that evening if you know what I mean. Maybe for drinks but I wouldn't eat there again. Great server!"}
{"text":"A good place to go for a cold beer and to watch hockey. They have home cut fries and handmade samosas which are both very good. Manager Jay ALWAYS makes you feel welcome and makes it a point of saying hi. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Great pub! Went on a Thursday; great food and drink! Judith, our bartender, was kind and a great server. Awesome to talk with and made the evening and all around great time!
Came back on Friday and was taken care of by Kiki. Great personality who made our night out memorable. If this comment is read by staff, please know Kiki was a great representative of McLean's! She was attentive and fun to talk with. Overall, the experience at McLean's was excellent; highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place was great!  The staff is super friendly and most of them speak English very well.  I must have stayed for about four hours.  I really wanted to see more of the city, but I was having such a great time with the bartender Kenny and many other locals, that I didn't want to leave.  Not to mention, they have my favourite beer on tap, Alexander Keith's IPA.  I had a few of those, as well as the Italian Poutine, which is fries, tomato sauce, and cheese curds.  It was awesome.  And yhey have quite a few TV's, so if you want to watch a big sporting event, this is a great place to do it.  I can't think of one bad thing to say about it.  It is definitely on my list for places to go again, next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick late night bite on a Saturday. Our server was busy but did her best to make sure we never needed anything. I had a triple decker grilled cheese - with only American cheese. I think they should have stepped it up and had more than one kind in a triple decker. It was just white bread and yellow cheese. Meh!

The fries were good, but otherwise I was unimpressed."}
{"text":"I've already posted a similar review over on Urbanspoon (not sure if I'm allowed to say that) but I'll do so since I've just joined Yelp. 

As a non-native Montrealer (but former frequent visitor), I don't think you can do much better than McLean's if you want a great sports bar with a super location, helpful staff, a nice beer selection and awesome pub food. 

I hadn't been to Montreal for several years and feeling nostalgic I decided to make McLean's my first stop. My more refined girlfriend probably would rather have gone someplace else but thankfully this place is much more than great memories. She's someone with a far more discerning palate than my own and even she was impressed. She called her potato skins the best she's ever tasted (I agreed, not far off) and my pesto pizza was absolutely incredible.

We went in after a long train ride just wanting some decent grub and a cold beer at a familiar spot and were really impressed. Maybe I was partying a little too hard when I visited Montreal semi-regularly in my younger days because I don't remember it being as good as it was.

Do yourself a favour next time you're in the city and make this your first stop after you check in at your hotel. You won't be disappointed. 

As a final aside, I noticed that Stuart, the manager of McLean's, commented on my review on the other site and does the same for reviews here, whether they're positive or  negative. If it's a good review (as I believe they all should be!) he thanks customers for their kind words. If the experience wasn't so great, he tries to fix it. If that doesn't deserve an extra star, I don't know what does."}
{"text":"This bar always has a great atmosphere during the hockey season and the summer months. Foosball, good menu, decent assortment of beer, great staff...not much else you can ask for from a bar that doesn't damage the wallet. Also the ideal bar for tourists that want to stay in the downtown core."}
{"text":"Hit this place up after working all day in Boston and then driving the 5 hours to Montreal. It was a lot of fun. We arrived and while the bar was crowded, we got a table right away. We ordered the beer tower that was a perfect way to start off the night. They had a great juke box and the crowd was really diverse and having fun. I threatened my group to drop a $20 in and put Justin Beiber on again and again. Needless to say, that did not go over to well with the table. 

Our server Jackieline was friendly and efficient. As soon as the drinks started running low, she was on top of it. We were certainly not her only table, so she managed it well. The part that I liked best about this place was that it stayed open until 3am. We did not get to Montreal until about 1130p. Headed out around 1215a, so it was nice to have a place that was still going strong until 3a. We had a great time here! Stop by if you are there."}
{"text":"Great place to relax and grab a drink and some food. Take advantage of Touch Tunes and play any music you want!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I randomly walked in to McLean's on a recent trip to Montreal. The food is great but the service is better. Tim was behind the bar and not only does he make a mean Caesar he was spot on at figuring out what my (sometimes hard to please wife) would like. We met a ton of the regulars and had a great time. The GM Stuart is a great guy as well and really goes out of his way to make sure your having a good time. 

If you are in Montreal stop by you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went last Friday night, this place is a regular spot for me and muh friends, great service, great atmosphere, great staff! This was the first time i ate sumthin here tho and it was verrrrry good! I was blown away in specific last Friday tho: we walked in to the Canadian's game playing on every one of the many well-placed big screen tv's and a home-ran trivia game going on betweeen periods (our trivia team name was something i won't post here but i made sure with the trivia host it was ok to say on mic lol - in fact he encouraged it lol), they played music during the commercials and our waitress Adrian was the most delightful upbeat friendly awesomest waitress i have ever encountered! I ordered the Supreme Hamburger Steak which was perfect: mushrooms cooked to perfection, onions, delicious beef and a fantastic thick brown pepper gravy (make sure to specify u want extra pepper gravy for two reasons: 1- it's so good you'll wana drown ur whole plate in it and 2- if u don't specify they'll bring u nasty bbq sauce type gravy which is boo-ey), and their french fries are also crispy perfection. There was also a charity event going on with a shooter girl with Jameson where half the proceeds went to underprivilged kids' sports programs and equipment- it was held by the family (who were so sweet and lovely) of some poor young man who was murdered (i was drunk by the end of the night so i can't remember the name and i lost the card i was given... ) to help kids be able to play hockey and other sports so that was pretty kool too. Oh and i forgot to mention Bob the most awesome doorman ever- but don't f@$k with him ...you'd regret that...  Overall great night as per usual!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, lazy rude staff. Me and my fiancé sat for 15 minutes while people around us received service. Ended up walking out."}
{"text":"This is a pub with heart. There's a magic thing that happens when a regular bar takes the time to truly care about the lives of their customers and their community. Without being a particularly beautiful room, though it is cosy, a bar like this can channel kinds of fun that only happen when you feel a little extra comfortable in a space. McLean's is one of those places. You can drink giant beers, gorgeous Ceasars, eat tasty pub food, but also get lost in a conversation with the manager or bartenders here for hours and have a hilarious time watching sports (or pretending to care about sports, you know, whatever works for you.) Ask about the name plate on the downstairs bar, you'll get an idea of what I mean."}
{"text":"I just love McLeans! I started going with a friend for a good burger at lunch about 3-4 yrs ago. You got a seat at the bar, burger in almost minutes and after a few visits - Tim had the Crown Royal ready to pour when I walked in the door. 
McLeans to me, must be what Cheers felt like for Norm. 
There's always a game on their multiple tv's, huge towers of beer, staff that get to know you and what you drink and surprisingly amazing samosas! 
Ya there's that the one guy at the bar with the repetitive stories no one cares to hear, but Cheers wouldn't have been the same without Cliff ;)

Not too long ago the legend of Hurley's (otherwise known as Kenny's bar to most) joined McLeans and most of us have changed our weekend watering hold to McLeans as well. In your first 5mins of being served by Kenny at McLeans - you'll know why.

What can I say? The selection of whiskey, great company and even former staff constantly frequenting- McLeans found the niche of not only being a great place for tourists, but the locals as well."}
{"text":"I am always disappointed with the beer selection in Canada  come on people get with the program ! From the looks of this place it should have been awesome, it's billed as an \"Irish pub\" type of bar the atmosphere was great lots of TV's a loud pre-game crowd but the food was just unimpressive. I had a Ruben - which should have been a very safe bet in an Irish  pub but it wasn't good at all! American cheese, What??? The waitress was rude when I was paying with my CC she noticed I didn't have a chip in my card and I was having some issue with the machine they bring to the table so you can pay and she said \"Your American it doesn't like you\" well then thanks lady...smh"}
{"text":"Great place. Go see Kenny at the bar. Be sure to ask him about how he lost his bet on the patriots...

Very friendly place, they make you feel welcome from the moment you walk in. Shots of Jamo all around. Will be back for sure!


Update 2/5/16 Kenny not only did they make the playoffs , they won the whole dam thing.......but I think we all lose seeing you in a Patriots Cheerleader outfit!!!!"}
{"text":"This was may first stop after arriving in Montreal and it was a great indicator of what a wonderful weekend lay ahead.

We snagged an open table for three as we arrived and ordered one of their 3 liter beer towers. I can't remember what kind of beer we ordered, but we asked the server for a local recommendation and it was really good. I love the concept.

The clientele was a mix of college-age kids and folks a little bit older like us. The main difference here between a Canadian bar and a US bar is that everyone here was having a great time. No pushing, no shoving, no angry interactions, just everyone enjoying themselves. There really is something to be said about the drinking age being 18.

What makes this a five star review was our server. She was both friendly and super efficient. As my friend and I drank beer from the tower, girly (who doesn't drink beer) drank bacardi & diet. As soon as her drink was almost done, the server would be at our table asking if we wanted more. This was no mean feat as the place was packed and she was busy!

**I have her name on the receipt, but I don't have it with me. I will update this review with it as she deserves the recognition.

As for the other review mentioning the music choice, dude, it's a jukebox! If you don't like the music, use the power of the dollar and make your voice heard!

UPDATE: Server's name was Jacqueline! Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I stumble into Mclean's this morning after a long night of drinks and debauchery.  We're greeted by a jovial bartender by the name of Kenny, he greets us with a warm welcome and more importantly some witty banter!!   

The \"Kehd\" is quite the character, this bar is quite the place.  It's the first time I wanted to befriend a bartender but won't be the last time I come to this place!!

{"text":"I  enjoyed the chicken tikka poutine . It's a must try along with the other new poutine Flavors they now feature on their menu. Ask the super friendly staff , they'll describe these new awesome poutine Flavors . Don't forget to wash down these excellent meals with a nice cold pint of beer"}
{"text":"It is unfortunate I'm downgrading my review about McLeans, one of my favourite Montreal pubs. We came with friends last Saturday to watch the Canadiens match as this has been always one of the best places for hockey night. We were surprised at first McLeans kept showing NFL instead of switching to the pre game. So far so good, there were American football fans sitting at the bar, let them enjoy, but the NFL game remained on even after the hockey one started. The most frustrating part was the fact that all the customers in the pub kept complaining to the personnel to put the hockey game on and we heard one pretty arrogant statement, what do you want, we are showing the game. We were ten minutes into the hockey match when they finally put the sound on, but still didn't show hockey on the main screen. By then we paid our check and left. So did most of the clients who haven't ordered food. 

Conslusion, McLeans is not a place I will choose for hockey night from now on. If McLeans wants to be known as the best place in town for NFL games, please announce it and stop distributing to the customers your hockey menu. By the way the beer battered pickles are horrible, they should be removed from the menu or if McLeans plans to show NFL games, they'd better learn how to prepare a typical for the Southern States speciality."}
{"text":"Go here! I used to frequent Montreal and never had a bad time at McLeans. Right off St. Catherine but not filled with Canadian college kids or Boston frat guys. Its normally a bunch of locals trying to catch a hockey game...or 10 of them from 5 different leagues at 1 time. Food is good and drinks are priced fair. Craig used to be the bartender and he was the man. DRINK ALEXANDER KEITHS and an Upper Cut. I seriously have a place in my heart for McLeans."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, Chicken Tikka (plate or burger) is hands down the best bet on the menu.  

Beer towers (giraffe) available, but new electronic self tap tables upstairs are amazing!  Self pour Keith's ($4.50/pint) and Bud Light ($3/pint) at 3 tables, put your card at the bard and pour away!"}
{"text":"Good pub food, lots of food for the price. Got the fried trio, mushrooms are excellent, the would have been even better with ranch dressing. Service was outstanding, I love that everyone speaks French and English universally."}
{"text":"Well, I have to redo my review since it was flagged offensive to our waitress (It proves how bad was my experience) who served herself for the tip and got away. I think the least we can say is that it is shady and dishonest. I would add that it is insulting the customers.

Still stand, far not impressed by this pub in Montreal. Food is not good even for a pub and I do not need to comment further about the poor service which was very slow and unpleasant.

I suggest the to go to Cafe Republic or walk 4 blocks West to Old Yer Orchard."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Friendly, great food and great drinks for a fair price.  We come up from New York every year and even though it's unsuspecting, this is our go to lunch spot"}
{"text":"Being a tourist from the US it was nice to find a place in Montreal that felt a little like home. Typical Irish bar but with cheap beer towers, pool tables, good \"pick your own\" music and above average bar food. Good for the group of travelers that are more into laid back lounge atmosphere. And they have Guinness!"}
{"text":"Solid bar service, French onion soup is ok, fish & chips were ok. No beer selection beyond mass produced and larger breweries (what can I say, I'm a beer snob).

Beer prices were good, whiskey not so much."}
{"text":"I was only in Montreal for 2 nights and spent the first one working. Needless to say, for my last night in Montreal, I wanted to get out there, have a beer and meet some locals so i looked on my trusty yelp app and out of all the bars that came up, McLean's sounded like the one I would like the most. From the moment I sat down until the moment I left, I had good beer and good conversation. The reviews mentioning Kenny are all true- awesome bartender who even took a minute after his shift to sit down with his baby (oops....I mean LADY) pint...and showed me some cool pics from his awesome travels.  The locals just sitting around the bar made me feel welcome as well and it's nice to know that Americans and Canadians can bond over football and hockey. If you're looking for an unpretentious place to have a beer and meet some down to earth local folks, do yourself a favor and head here."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the American NFL playoffs... Food was not that great. Was not that cheap. However the beers cold and delicious. The waitresses were very friendly and so were the locals. Again... Perfect place to see NFL, big TVs and Live Sound!"}
{"text":"Visited twice over St Patricks weekend the first time we had to leave as we had the kids with us and we're told kids we're not allowed ! Which was surprising and annoying. The second time just my wife and I went for a few drinks to start our night. They have an extensive beer menu but no Molson Canadian. The music was load but really good. Their food menu also looked good but we didn't hang around to try it. Overall this is a decent bar but nothing special."}
{"text":"Great place with a friendly and helpful staff. A large selection of beers on tap and lots more in bottles. I started with a Mill Street IPA and finished with a Guinness. I had the tikka chicken sandwich with poutine for a late lunch and it was terrific. Overall a great experience. I'm in Montreal for a meeting and will be here all week. I'll definitely be back to McLean's Pub!"}
{"text":"While on our trip to Montreal, Candace and I accidentally stumbled into the world's worst place. We promptly left and headed next door and found McLean's. To be fair, anything would have looked great in comparison, but McLean's was cool regardless.

It happened to be Comedy Open Mic night, which we were a bit trepidacious about, but it ended up being really fun. We saw some good acts and also some other acts. The last act of the night was the bartender. I'll use that as a smooth transition into discussing the service.

The bartender was great. I've always considered tending bar to be an art, and Peter was clearly very skilled technically. Watching him perform brought about pure pleasure. It's always a toss up whether or not your drink is going to be satisfyingly strong, but Peter was definitely generous. He also remembered my name throughout the night, which is always appreciated. If I had one complaint, it's that he could have been tidier, but I'm probably just being up tight."}
{"text":"Good basic tavern food, actually a little better than usual. Good broad selection of droughts. Lots of large TVs with lots of sports packages."}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice place to grab some lunch and brews and we came across McLeans on our travels. Got seated immediately, and although it began to rain we were taken inside and upstairs. It was a bit noisy due to a couple large groups, but that didn't take away from our experience. 

They were out of shocktop-the waitress recommended a house draft beer (the name escapes me right now because I've had a bit much of it) and we got a pitcher since it was happy hour. They did have a very large selection of draft and imported beers as well as any other type alcohol you're craving. The atmosphere was very chill; pool table, jukebox, fooseball table. 

The food: DELICIOUS. My boyfriend and I decided on some mozzarella sticks but the waitress informed us that there was cheddar cheese instead of the traditional. From the seasoned breaded coating to the oozing cheddar cheese, even down to the spicy dipping sauce; we inhaled them. I went with the pizza as my entree which was seemingly hand/house prepped and made, and my boyfriend went with a bacon cheddar burger. Everything was delicious and fresh. 

Definitely stop here if you're looking for some good food, brews, and a good time."}
{"text":"Un bon pub à l'irlandaise, ça fait toujours du bien le vendredi après une dure semaine de travail. C'est dans cette humeur là que je m'y suis retrouvée la première fois. C'est une place parfaite pour s'y retrouver avec une gang d'amis pour une soirée pas compliquée à regarder \"la game\" et boire une bière, ou deux, ou un mètre en entier. Au lieu d'un pichet traditionnel, ils offrent des espèces de tubes de bière d'environ un mètre. Ils ont l'air vraiment cool et vous en voudrez un si vous penser y prendre plus d'une pinte. Je n'y suis pas restée très longtemps, mais une des choses que j'ai bien aimée de l'endroit est l'énergie qui s'y dégageait. Peut-être que c'était à cause du soleil, mais peut-être aussi, que c'est simplement parce que c'est un pub où l'ambiance est toujours bonne. J'aime bien penser que c'est la deuxième raison."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for dinner.  We were looking for an Irish pub, and ended up here.  As we walked in we saw a group of guys in suits drinking from a gigantic tube of beer. The thing was easily ten feet tall, and apparently held 22 liters of beer. The guys in suits had about a foot of beer left in the tube, and they were all signing to the classic rock that was playing.
     We sat by their great big open window, enjoyed the breeze that would pass through, and watched the people walking along the sidewalk, as well as the cars that infrequently drove past.  
     The cute waitress came over and asked what we would like to drink, I went with my usual cheap American beer. Bud Light.  My friends ordered significantly more fancy beers.  After perusing the menu a bit, I was intrigued by cream cheese on a burger, so I ordered the McLean Burger.  I also ordered a plate of poutine for the table. My friends then ordered significantly healthier items. (Screw healthy, I'm on vacation damnit.) 
     Cute waitress took our orders and delivered them to the kitchen, and before too long our food was out.   Beers came out, then the first food out was the poutine.  Cheese curds and gravy was smoothed over french fries. Decadently unhealthy.  We all attacked the plate, and shortly after our first few fork-fulls of french fry, cheese curd and gravy, our meals arrived. Not sure if a fork is the correct method to eat poutine, but...we're stupid tourists.
     The burger with cream cheese was great! I secretly wondered where they got sliced cream cheese to put on the burger, as it was less of a smear of the stuff, but more a cleanly cut slice. Canada, what will you surprise me with next?  I ate the fries and burger on my plate, and then attempted further damage to the plate of poutine (and probably also to my arteries.)

    The dinner was great.  The total bill was $110(ish) The drunk guys in suits continued to (poorly) belt out the classics, and the ambiance of the place was just great.  Whenever I'm next in this crazy burg I'll definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Stuart, the manager, met with me after my negative review to hear me out. His resolution was not only fair, but it was generous and has restored my faith in McLean's. The owner overreacted and it turns out that the dog is fine tied up to the outside of the terrasse as I had hoped all along, so I will definitely pop by here often this summer to have a pint, people watch and see my friends. Thanks for hearing customers out and for being such a rad place. Many types of cold beer and butter chicken is now on the official menu, not just as a special!"}
{"text":"Getting towards the end of my day of visiting Montréal, my FitBit had measured 15000 steps as I walked in to McLean's. That calls for a beer!

Well served by Kenny the bartender, who helpfully poured said beer and in a friendly manner helped me find a very fancy restaurant for dinner. And not just for me. The Bruins fans who came in later also got a recommendation. Absolutely awesome.

Sure, I could have stayed at McLean's, but I can have a great burger and some sports fans anywhere. I wanted something a bit fancier."}
{"text":"While flying from California to Montreal, I found McLean's on yelp.  I sent a message asking if they could hold a table for my group so we can watch the Ducks v Sens game.  I got an immediate response from the owner it was no problem, but no sound as the Habs game would trump our game. No problem!

When we got there, bad news. Rogers TV blocked our game. No worries we still had to eat.

We were led to the back, past the slot machines, and up the stairs to a cozy nook all of our own.  There were tvs surrounding us, just too bad it wasn't our game. 

Our server was excellent.  She first asked each of us our name, wrote it down, and then wrote our order based on our names.  By the middle of the evening she actually called to us by name.  How personal!  She was sassy and she was organized.  We did have 1 or 2 orders mixed up, but it was corrected.  She even divided our cheque based on party rather than giving us one big bill.  Maybe they do that in Montreal but we don't get that luxury in California!

I can't find anything bad about the place.. .well except our game was blacked out, but that's Rogers TV, not the bars.

Food was good, but I after visting other places in Montreal, it wasn't the greatest. I'd definitely patronize them again if I am in town."}
{"text":"Nothing special here AT ALL. Skip it a go to Peel Pub or anywhere else.

Only two beers on tap due to a shortage was a first let down.  No kids menu, which is fine, but the pizza was gooping with cheese so thick it was hard to cut it, and with barely any sauce it just fell apart. The chicken fingers and fries were OK, but the fries were dark as if the oil hasn't been changed in a while or they were left in too long.

The grown ups ordered wings and sweet potato fries, nothing too challenging. Except that our order went to the wrong table, they made no attempt to apologize or even acknowledge their error, and when the wings did arrive they were literally drowning in sauce so thick is was like a BBQ soup.

On the plus side the server was super nice, and liked our kids... it's always a plus when the kids make a good impression."}
{"text":"5 of us stopped in last Sunday to kill some time before catching a flight back to Indianapolis after my brother's bachelor party weekend. Great poutines, great drinks. And the best part -- Kenny the bartender. We all agreed that we've had few, if any, service professionals to better take care of and entertain us. (Waiting in the airport later...\"Where's Kenny when we need him??) You're the sh** Kenny!"}
{"text":"Came in here for drinks. Extremely weak -- obviously trying to rip off tourists.  My husband had a Jameson and ginger I tried a sip because I hate Jameson and I didn't even cringe. I had a long island iced tea which was in a pretty small glass (for almost $10) and didn't even feel a darn thing. When he went up to ask for a shot or something he got into some kind of weird altercation and we left. Tourists beware"}
{"text":"I was looking for a new place to go and McLean's fit the bill. The jalapeno poppers were the best I've ever had, and I have had a few. The burger is also better than the average burger. They have a good selection of beer, but nothing fancy. BTW, they have 3l and 10l pitchers. Yes, that is 10 or 30 beers. I should have taken a picture. A great place to watch the game."}
{"text":"This place is a definite 5 star pub. 

The food was top notch. I recommend the sausage dinner. It comes with rice, fries and a salad. The fries alone make it worth the trip. 

The beer select was very good with about 15 on tap.

The wait staff was friendly and a bunch of hockey fans....go figure.  

The thing that makes this so is the atmosphere. Just a great place to be. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty cool, although a bit cramped. You will wind up brushing up against someone else trying to get through to the other side of the pub. The bartenders are nice and very attentive. They also have lots of tables and chairs, hence the lack of space. However, it is a cool place to come with friends, grab a tube of beer, and play some fuseball."}
