{"text":"Excellent Food ! Excellent Service! A very unique Trendy but Authentic Japanese Sushi Restaurant !!! I went with my younger brother who is in University and my friend who is Connoisseur in Japanese Sushi and Premium Sake on a Sunday night. The staff was super friendly, especially Tomoko, she is very professional and make us feel welcome right away, take time to introduce whats their house special dishes to us ... And the Food Was Amazing ! I WISH MORE PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THIS HIDDEN Authentic Japanese Sushi and Premium Sake Restaurant. I DEFINITELY HIGHLY RECOMMEND ... It's one of The Best Sushi Restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Check in during winterlicious and Toronto light fest, hit two birds in one stone. We didn't make the reservation but the super cute waiter find us a seat although it's fully booking. Whats more , he introduced us a secret drink menu and  send us one free shot. We order the sashimi and it's supper fresh and tastes. We have cheeses cake and cream brûlée for dessert. The cream brûlée is awesome."}
{"text":"My family and I were hungry, but all of the American restaurants and pubs in the area were very crowded. We walked up Gristmill Lane and saw Boku. We were seated promptly and were given the menus. Everything on the menu sounded good. We ordered: boku maki, soba salad, deep fried chicken pieces(don't know what it's called), spring rolls, and another sushi dish. Everything was excellent! We were served our food very fast which is good because we were starving. We sat outside which was very pleasant...I'm giving Boku 4 stars only because the service towards the end was bad, but the food was excellent and earlier the service was good."}
{"text":"If you're a bit sensitive to smell, I would skip out on the distillery rolls because the smell is a tiny bit pungent. Taste however, is quite good. It's crispy, decadent with the oil, and flavorful. 

Definitely get the Boku rolls because they both taste good, mild scent, and are pretty plentiful for the price. It tasted mildly sweet, a small tinge of the mackerel's taste and very satisfying to eat.

The seared salmon sashimi was very well done, seared sushi is always more well done than regular sashimi and sushi places that offer it, can't go wrong with that one. The in house soy sauces are fantastic with this. 

The seared wagyu beef was handed to us by the chef (which I was unsure as to whether the waitress was busy) making the experience of taking it feel special. Eat it in one bite and chew throughly, the rice falls apart easy. The texture was a bit tough, so i'm unsure if i'd get this one again. But definitely get some seared sushi.

Restaurant is small but the staff is very accommodating, the sushi chefs work close to the bar where you can observe their handiwork. A great experience."}
{"text":"Dinner service was pretty slow with only 1 server working on a busy Saturday night. They advised that this was their normal number of servers and that we would be taken care of. Sadly, it took nearly 20 mins from the time we sat down to even get our drink orders. Food service was also relatively slow waiting nearly 15 mins in between dishes. 

Food quality was good and fish was fresh. House Sake was also very good. 

Based on the cost of the dinner per person ($90), not being entirely full from my meal, coupled with the slow service... a 3 star rating is all I can give. I'd expect higher attention to detail and service when paying this much for dinner."}
{"text":"We were first lured in by the Japanese cheesecake they were selling at their cake shop (spoiler: it was gorgeous!). The place has a charming rustic décor. It was during Winter Market, there was no table for walk-in, so we asked to be seated at the bar.
Tea comes in individual pots with fresh loose leaves and wide range of teas to choose from. We were being greedy and lazy at the same time, so we ordered the Omakase sushi set. It is a platter of the chef's pick sushi of the day. I can say it was the most authentic Japanese cuisine experience we have had ever since we moved here from Asia couple years ago. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"A wonderful lunch experience. We had the salmon and saba torched boxed nigiri and it was worth the money. Also got some spicy maki which is pretty tough to mess up, but was definitely top tier spicy maki. It's a bit more expensive than other sushi places, but the service and presentation beats Japango in my opinion."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. We went there twice in one week because we had such a delicious dinner the first time. It seems a bit pricy but it is worth it. And the edamamé with wasabi are really good."}
{"text":"Authentic foods, super friendly and helpful staff, great dècor and patio. A must go restaurant in Distillery District."}
{"text":"After going to the Touhenboku Ramen on Queen Street many times, I was very looking forward to trying the Touhenboku Sushi in the Distillery District. 

Visit: April 2015

Venue: Beautiful! modern and minimal design. Beautiful bar with stunning display of Sake bottles. $$$$$

Food: We had various Pressed Sushi and also Boku Maki. We also tried a couple of sake. Sushi tasted great. Salmon Pressed Sushi was my favourite. Sake was really fun to try although I really didn't know much about it. We also had dessert after sushi. Green tea creme brûlée was full of green tea taste and that's good. Japanese cheese cake was very good too, nice soft texture. In addition, presentation of food was all beautiful. I do wish there would be more varieties. $$$$

Service: Very friendly staff. Very knowledgeable. Whenever we need recommendation or explanation whether it's the menu or the sake, staff was very detailed in letting us know the different types of sake and what sushi were the popular dishes there. Food did take a long time to be brought to the table. I am not sure if that's supposed to be the way it is with the sushi making. It's not a big deal as we were enjoying the ambience of the restaurant. $$$$$

Conclusion: I would say if you want a little fancy and trendy night out japanese style, this place is a good choice. It's an upscale restaurant based on the pricing in my opinion. For me, best is to enjoy different sake and pair them with some sushi. On the other hand, if you are really hungry and want a lot of food, your bill will add up very quickly. It's not a criticism; just an observation."}
{"text":"Came here to try their Winterlicious dinner menu with 3 friends. 

My overall impression of this restaurant was just okay, nothing special. It was nice that the waiter described everything we were eating to us, but other than that, the service was less than impressive. We were not presented with menus when we sat down and it took us too long to flag someone down. Also, the food came slower than expected - there was a table of 2 beside us who ordered just before us and they were already eating their main course when our appetizers arrived. 

The food itself tasted average. I had the sashimi to start and it tasted standard. One of my friends ordered the shrimp and chicken skewers for her appetizer and said it was served cold, like came out of the fridge cold, which was not expected. All 4 of us ordered the aburi as our main and we all agreed it was just alright. You could get definitely get better elsewhere in Toronto. Dessert was good, once again nothing too special. 

Not sure if I would come again to try the aburi from their regular menu. Wouldn't be impressed if the quality is the same as what was served during Winterlicious."}
{"text":"Excellent and fresh dishes! Highly recommend the Distillery Roll.  The Asahi beer was also very good- nice and light to pair with the sushi.  Attentive staff and nice relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"We just had a lovely night at Boku in Distillery.  This modern looking beautiful decored restaurant served very fresh sushi and tasty tapas.  My favourite was avocado/scallop tempura. Boy that was good!  I could have eaten more if my family would have let me :).  As for sushi, we had Aburi nigiri (torched sushiI), a few kinds of makis.  I had a craving for sushi last a few days and Boku satisfied my stomach.  Everything we had was excellent.  I am sure we will be back soon."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite restaurant in the distillery district. 

I went with a group of friends during the Christmas market and everything we tried was delicious! The box pressed sushi, especially the Saba one, was great! 

Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We were in Toronto on vacation and found Boku while walking around the distillery.  We we going to go to the brewery, but ended up at sushi - mostly due to its great patio and the enthusiastic and welcoming staff.  The sushi was wonderful and the tempura some of the best I've tasted.  Lovely lunch, accommodating staff, well worth the price."}
{"text":"Had a very nice meal of creative, interesting sushi. Their selection of maki rolls is limited, but the all the sushi is quite good. They also have a full menu of Japanese dishes.

I had a Spider Roll, which I hesitated to order because I've had those so many places, but this one was especially tasty. I had a Boku Maki, which is wrapped in seared albacore tuna. They have a selection of nigiri prepared as Aburi, which means hand torched. I got the Aburi Sampler; the pieces were warm and smokey from the torch. See the pictures I've posted.

They weren't busy on a Tuesday night. The service was quick and attentive. The location is a little difficult to find--tucked away on an alley in the Distillery District between Mill St and Distillery Ln--but worth the effort to find. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"My daughter's godmother recommended Boku but I had never heard of it. Came here after taking in Luzia. 

I was a little surprised how empty the restaurant was on a Friday night in the summer and I remember thinking if we had a made a mistake. I was so wrong! The sushi was some of the freshest I've had in a while and my daughter loved her miso cod. We even got a little adventurous towards the end and decided to try the grilled horse meat. Tasted like beef but gamier. 

All in all a good experience, my only complaint was that the service could've been more attentive considering the staff outnumbered the patrons that night."}
{"text":"Best sushi my husband and I have ever tasted.  Compliments to the master chef that created all of our dishes to order.  We got two sake flights, shrimp and vegetable tempura, small sashimi dinner, distillery roll and a surprise dish at the end!!
Service was amazing, if I could give more than five stars I would.  Hidden gem of Toronto Christmas Market for sure."}
{"text":"Went with a party of 8 recently and was underwhelmed by the food however the service was friendly and attentive.
The good: Soba salad
The disappointing: Aburi (tasted and looked more grilled than blow torched), scallop and avocado tasted and looked beige, sweet potato fries were raw/undercooked.
With all of her choices for good sushi in TO I won't plan to be back."}
{"text":"The selection was minimal and the taste wasn't anything out of the ordinary. The decor was great though."}
{"text":"The best Japanese restaurant in Toronto!!! Servers are very friendly and helpful. The food is super fresh and decorated in its unique design. All the food is made with chef's secret source and designated with his passion. If you are looking for authentic Japanese food with Japanese fishes, this restaurant should be your first choice."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious at a price of $38 for dinner. 

Service - Very good throughout the evening. Friendly and attentive waiter. 

Food - The food was good. The quality was good as well, for the price I think it was fair. The portion size was a bit small in my opinion. Although my friend got the dragon roll which looked HUGE. The torched sushi is their specialty and I would recommend it. The sashimi appetizer and dessert were really quite average. 

Drinks - Beer is well priced. The cocktails were so so, I wouldn't have cocktails here again. 

Overall, I would come here again if I'm in the area, but I wouldn't purposely go out of my way to make it here."}
{"text":"Hmm... I'd say food quality is 4/5 but overall it's not a very good value which makes me not want to give it 4 stars. 

I came here for Summerlicious and even beforehand I could tell I won't be full from it. I had oysters (appetizer), sushi board (main), matcha creme brulee (dessert). 

Oysters: were fresh but there were only three
Sushi board: compared to a lot of other higher end places, the selection wasn't as interesting and overall portion was small (7 pieces). It really just feels like an appetizer
Dessert: was pretty good

I know ala-carte places are not for pigging out and Summerlicious is more like a sample menu.. but still.. I've had more filling Summerlicious dinners in the past. That being said, some other menu options were dis-proportionally larger portions compared to my tiny sushi board. My suggestion would be to make the sushi board a little less sad and add at least 2 more pieces? 3 if they feel generous. To compare, you could get a sushi board + maki at Saku for under $30. This meal was almost $50 after tax and tip. They also charged us steep 18% even though I didn't even have as many people as my original reservation. True, that was my fault, however they could've been nicer since they didn't have to serve as many people.

I considered ordering from the menu but looking at their prices, it didn't seem worth it. The prices are on par with Ja Bistro or Miku but I feel like this place is just not on the same level. The service was pretty slow too."}
{"text":"We ordered the spicy maki and vegetable maki plates. Decent food overall. A bit pricier for the quality you get, but it was a nice meal. Plus the waiter didn't know how to pronounce 'maki.' Call me a bouge, but I feel like it's a basic need for a Japanese restaurant server."}
{"text":"Wow what a fantastic patio! It even lights up beautifully! 

The salmon sashimi and scallop sashimi we ordered were fantastically fresh! So delicious. Also highly recommend their aburi sushi (there's an assorted torched sushi dish). Very fresh, very flavourful with the smoke from the torch. 

We also ordered the beef tataki which we enjoyed - recommend that you mix the beef into the sauce throughly and let it penetrate for a minute before enjoying! 

Overall a great spot and would return!"}
{"text":"Authentic sushi in a swanky spot right across from a sake distillery. Good selection of fish, well-priced lunch specials. I recommend getting some sushi and pairing it up with Blanche De Chambly, which they have on draft. It really accentuates the smoky savoury flavour of the soy sauce. 

Had a chirashi along with some a la carte -- the aburi saba is a winner as well. If I'm ever in the area, I'll definitely go again and try more of their stuff!"}
{"text":"We have a group event tonight. The service was great! The manager is so knowledgeable with sake. All the foods are super tasty. I highly recommend you  to try it. Price wise is okay, is not cheap but compare with the Miku, it's way more cheaper."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent staff! Manager dropped by our table to welcome us, nice touch. Miso ramen was a deliciously rich broth and the poke bowl was the perfect size and seasoned well. We will be back."}
{"text":"ordered katsu combo($16) for lunch and the pork cutlet was a bit too dry to me.
side dishes were better than the katsu itself
the miso soup was delicious-not too salty
my mom ordered grilled mackerel fish combo and the fish was tasty($16)
service was very friendly"}
{"text":"This place was a fantastic find, in The Distillery. As much as I enjoy El Catrin this is my new fav.

The service was very attentive. The server was genuinely interested in the food and beverage and took time to describe and get feedback on each item ordered. He also had extensive knowledge of the sake list and made great recommendations.

The food itself was great. The sashimi was so fresh. It was definitely one of the best Japanese restaurants I have been to in Toronto. We also ordered the scorched sushi which was phenomenal. 

Everything about this dining experience was outstanding and I'm glad it's in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I am sad to say that our experience was just not up to par.  Although the staff was friendly, the overall meal fell short on different levels.  

We were greeted in a courteous way.  I felt comfortable and had a good first impression.  This spiralled downwards very quickly.  

Service was extremely slow.  Everyone at our table received their food at different times.  Even the people who ordered the same thing had significant delays compared to one another.  This restaurant needs to improve on timing.  Are two sushi chefs enough?  It sure didn't seem like it.  

The sushi was okay, but I've certainly had better.  The rice didn't hold together very well.  Nor did some of the fish on the rice. 

The worst part was chewing one of my favourites (hamachi aka yellowtail) and discovering a fish bone at approximately one centimetre in length.  I felt something hard and poke the inside of my mouth.  This was completely unacceptable.  I brought it to the attention of one of the staff and even showed the bone on my plate.  I was given a reasonable apology and I was told the chef would be informed.  

It's really unfortunate things went from good to bad to worse.  This place had potential and it just didn't deliver."}
{"text":"Host was very rude, put us in a bad mood all night. Did not care about whether or not we got a table. No matter how good the food could be it is not worth being talked to disrespectfully. Definitely needs some change in staff."}
{"text":"I was in the area, and saw the good reviews for boku sushi, and the nice photos, so i decided to give it a try. O god, i don't know what happened, but what i got was a total surprise, and not the good kind. 

We ordered yakitori, chef's choice sushi platter, tuna carpaccio, botan shrimp sashimi, aburi yellowtail sushi

The tuna carpaccio, botan shrimp and aburi were ok, but the sushi and yakitori were bad!

The sushi were not cut properly nor was it formed properly, it looked like a chunk of overly large fish squished on top of a piece of rice by a child.  The maki was deformed and appeared not to have been cut properly. Looked like it was cut with a butter knife.

The yakitori had no taste, did not look like it was grilled at all.  It was boiled in water and soya sauce was poured over it.  The chicken and leek were all soggy and fell apart when you bite into it! 

I will not be back, the photos on yelp look nothing like what we got!!

Not sure how to link photos to review, but i will try to link photos to this review"}
{"text":"Service is amazing.  The winterlicious menu is great.  First time here and their tea ocha is sooooo good! Definitely will come back=)"}
{"text":"Boku Sushi is a chic Japanese restaurant located in the heart of Distillery District. It serves many of the Japanese classics ranging from sushi to tempura in a sophisticated atmosphere.

The sushi here features a Kansai flair - torched and box pressed. The torched and pressed flavours enhances the buttery smoothness of the fresh tasting sushi. The taste and textures are a standout.

Leave room for dessert. The matcha creme brulee is delightful. It's a great way to end a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Fresh no MSG broth with choice of thick or thin ramen and flavourings such as salt, miso or soy sauce, and fillings like pork or chicken. 

I like the diversity of the menu, that you can choose between vegetarian, chicken or pork broth (not just the latter). And you're not just stuck with pork as a protein either. The broth was tasty and wasn't overly salty. I wouldn't go with the garlic broth + salt though. 

They also had appetizers like dumplings and takoyaki, if noodles aren't enough. 

The portions are not as big as some of the other competitors, but it was enough. Noticeably was the amount of 'stuff' in the soup that seemed missing, but you can add for an extra cost. It only comes with 1 egg, some seaweed and one slice of the protein you chose."}
{"text":"Unbelievably poor experience being a restaurant in the distillery district.

First off, for a surprisingly not so busy night (3 tables were currently seated when walking in), nobody was there to greet us as the host was busy behind the bar on his phone texting up a storm. When he finally decided to look up from his millennial ways, he asked if we had a reservation and asked for our name over the bar to which he proceeded to say, \"okay, wait there\". After picking up what I assume to be a reservation book and walking over to my friend and I, he asked for our name again.

Little did we know he would be our server for the night since he had not introduced himself but quietly dropped the menus on the table and walked away.

Fast forward 15 minutes before deciding to ask if we would like a drink or help with the menu, we simply ordered from the winterlicious menu with ease since he seemed to be in a rush. 

The food itself was decent at best. Seemed like very little time and preparation was decidingly put into this. To be honest, for the winterlicious menu, the food could've been presented better and tasted better for that menu. As a comparison, mi-ne would have been a significantly better choice as the quality is superb. 

For apps: the lobster tempura and oysters were really enlightening however was quickly let down with the follow up mains of anago and ikayaki. The amount vinegar in the anago nigri was substantial and ikayaki was a cheaper version than that of don buri (Markham). 

Past the apps and main, I realized we haven't seen our server, where was he you ask? Oh on his personal cell phone walking into the bathroom talking about going out sometime this week. Fantastic...

Well who cares about that guy right? Because a waitress (the only other server available) was available for us to come to our aid and take our dessert order (three times). Yes, you heard it right, she had to come back three times before we could simply get a red bean and green tea ice cream... that was scooped out of a prebought tub.

Anyways, never saw the original server again till after we left... where you might ask? Behind the bar. Horrible experience. 

Understandably this is probably a one off experience but damn. It sucked."}
{"text":"This one was a little hard for me to rate. 
Can I say 3.75? Well that's the average after a debate with my lunch mates. 

The ambiance was very lovely and service was awesome. 

Tea cost ranges from 3-5 dollars however you have a good selection of green teas. We ordered the Genmai Matcha and the Gyokuro teas. 
The Genmai ($4) was mild and carried a light fragrance of roasted green tea. 
The Gyokuro ($5) was stronger and had a slightly stronger matcha taste, which gave it a little more bitter taste. 
By far one of the nicest tea experiences in a restaurant. 

For food, (this is the part that made the rating difficult) your standard sushi and sashimi wasn't something that I would rave about. Don't get me wrong, it was still very fresh, but not something to oooohhhh ahhhh over. It was the non standard aburi sushi (torched sushi) that was amazing. Fresh with a slight char made it something to write about (and ooooooohhhhh ahhhhh it was!)
The best part is it didn't carry a huge clump of rice, so one can definitely taste the freshness of the fish. 
When trying any Japanese restaurant that I haven't been to before, I always order a tempura and an order of their agedashi tofu (fried tofu). It will show you how the chef does in the cooked food category. 
Boku's tempura and agedashi tofu was amazing. Not too much batter. The sauces were also very flavourful and not too salty. 

Overall it was an awesome experience and I would definitely come again. Maybe for dinner ?"}
{"text":"This place deserve more reviews and stars =)
It's miso soup is seasoned very well and service is good. I had Chirashi and it was really good!! Quality of sashimi was far better than the Y***n*h*** where I had a dinner later. Price is very reasonable. Washroom is clean. Can't complain anything =)"}
{"text":"We were here for a business meeting, although the location, the patio and the food  quality was not bad. We were all not impressed with the waiter! His 'witty' and smart ass personality, his fingers inside my cup, destroying our orders, (messing them up) giving us confusing answers to our questions regarding the food names, and gluten free option. The food was absolutely nothing out of the ordinary! If anything if was boring! And a very minimal selection! I would not recommend this place or would we return! 
Although on the bright side,  I was very happy to learn about the next door Segway!"}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out while visiting the Distillery District.

It's a nice space that's catering to the hip.  It wasn't busy the day we went and so we were seated without a reservation on a Friday.

We started off with Miso Soup and Inari Sushi.  The Miso Soup was good but the Inari Sushi was excellent.  The latter is something that's easily split as an appetizer.

We ordered the Omakase sushi option featuring a pretty incredible selection of really fresh nigiri sushi for $50.  There were around 12 pieces or so.

For drinks, we ordered some Fukushima Sake.  The name escapes me at the moment but it was really smooth and the two of us downed a large bottle quite easily.

Finally for dessert, we had the Japanese cheesecake which was incredibly tasty.  It's not as light and fluffy as what you would get, at say, Tetsu's Cheesecake, but it's not as dense as a New York Cheesecake either.  It's the perfect in-between.

Overall, I enjoyed the experience.  The food and drinks were great. The server was very friendly and attentive as well.  The only downside is the cost - it ended up being slightly more on the costlier side of the cost:taste ratio (CTR)."}
{"text":"Hating my Saturday afternoon at the Toronto Christmas Market until we walked into this place for a late lunch. Most of the lunch crowd already left when we arrived to an empty restaurant. Not knowing anything about this place we gave it a try. Japanese Manager/Server was taking care of us. The restaurant decor cleverly designed to fit into the locale of the Distrillery District but still felt Japanese. The open kitchen with Sushi bar added to the charm. We ordered a tofu appetizer and shared a premium sushi set. Excellent  miso soup and salad came first followed by the tasty tofu appetizer, wish I could remember what it was called. But the treat was the nigiri sushi. Room temperature rice with excellent fish. The Japanese owner and chefs adds to the authentic experience. We got to know a little more the manager / Server after our meal. She said that they were the first restaurant in Toronto that served the Aburi style sushi with the torching. The owner also owns a Ramen shop in Toronto. I have eaten alot of sushi all over the world and in Tokyo. Very happy that the standards and the quality of the restaurants like this one in our little big city is becoming  just as good...world class..where are you Michelin?"}
{"text":"Came here on Valentine's Day w/ my companion and it was \"A-OK\".

My companion and I tried the Tai Aburi Hako, Aburi Flight, the Boku Maki, and the Green Tea Creme Brule. Everything was okay from what I remember.

I'd much rather go to Miku next time."}
{"text":"The location here is prime. It closes after the district so that very much encouraged us to check it out since we wanted to stay a little longer.

The food was great, we really liked the lobster tempura. 

The distillery roll was okay! It felt a little heavy with the roll being a little fried with the cheese. 

Overall, I recommend!"}
{"text":"Sushi is on point and the service is wonderful. A little pricey, but to be expected in the distillery. I have brought many visitors to Boku and they were blown away by the quality and end value. Yes, the rolls may be a bit expensive but this isn't all you can eat. Take your time, savour and enjoy and I guarantee you will be filled to the brim by the end. My favourites are the Boku roll and torched mackerel."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! They had flying fish sashimi on special, they sashimi the entire fish and present it beautifully! It was so fresh. Their torikara fried chicken and veg tempura were also fantastic.

I noticed they have a wonderful lunch menu as well which I love because a quick easy lunch is hard to come by in the distillery. 

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is over-priced. Our assorted sashimi platter was fresh. Sushi and nigiris were not surprising. Their Distillery rolls and Boku maki were nothing more than ordinary. Service was good, she was nice and efficient. The place was really empty for a Saturday night, it's still pretty new maybe that's why. JaBistro IS SO MUCH BETTER!"}
{"text":"We arrived on time and the table wasn't available so we had a bit of a wait, however the waiter handled the situation well and provided exceptional customer service. Excellent sushi, would come close to some of the best I've had. The restaurant has limited seating and it's a very cozy atmosphere. We really enjoyed our time here. Will come again!"}
{"text":"Stunning food and service . Must have in Toronto downtown .Amazing service and thank you for the great suggestion from Anthony ."}
{"text":"Came here for cocktail hour with some friends, the place is busy so we waited 30 mins to be seated. We ordered sake and beer to start while we perused their menu. After coordinating with my party of 7, we decided on Distillery rolls, Boku maki, Unashiso maki, Agedashi tofu and Haramuki. 

The food were tasty and different (definitely of higher quality than some places) but the waitstaff was horrible! I felt he needed to take an etiquette for waitstaff, he didn't recite what's on specials, was impatient about taking our food orders and was not friendly! 

Food is important, but so is experience and if waitstaff aren't up to par with food, it makes going back almost non-existent."}
{"text":"I guess I should have looked over the menu a bit more before selecting this restaurant.  For a sushi place they don't offer a huge variety of sushi, especially the maki rolls.  I guess this is my personal preference but I enjoy the maki rolls full of crazy and unexpected ingredients.  Also, the rolls are a bit on the smaller side.  Most maki rolls I've had come with 8 pieces not 6.  The smaller portions made it harder to share as well as we thought we ordered enough food but did not.  That being said, what we did have was pretty good but I just hate leaving a restaurant hungry and underwhelmed."}
{"text":"We were here during the rush of a Christmas Market night. Everywhere else was packed and we wanted to sit down to a meal, so we thought we'd try Boku. We were greeted and seated promptly, however it took at least 15 minutes for the server to come back and to fill our water glasses. This would be the ONLY time we had our water glasses filled. The food was good, but I wasn't floored by any of the flavours, especially given the heftier price tag than you'd pay elsewhere. We had the tempura seafood and veg udon, spicy scallop and salmon canapé and box pressed saba sushi. The shrimp tempura was definitely better than you'd get an your local run of the mill sushi joint, but the rest of the was meh. I've had better mackerel box pressed sushi at Guu, there wasn't enough of the char to it. Also, the food did not come out at a good pace and we had finished the udon and canapé, and waited 10 mins before the box sushi came out. There were only two servers working that night, one of which was also the hostess, which meant that we could never get anyone's attention to get our bill. After waiting 20 minutes trying to make eye contact with anyone, I finally went up to the server as I was going to the bathroom to ask for the bill. There definitely should have been more servers working that night, especially when you know that the whole Distillery District is going to be teeming with people. Or if you are really busy, maybe leave the carafe of water at each table so you don't have to pay as much attention to that. From the great reviews that this restaurant I really expected better. This experience has really tainted my view and I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out with friends. Sashimi is so fresh! Great service! Will absolutely come back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is new but a gem! We came across this place while we were walking the distillery district on Saturday evening. It was pretty late, think they were about to close but the server was nice enough to let us grab a seat on the patio and order food. I asked the server what was their famous dish and he stated that they opened not too long ago but their miso ramen was popular, it comes with pork but I don't eat pork and the server was kind enough to recommend the miso ramen without pork and replace it with mushroom. 
It was pretty damn good! I inhaled mine, although it needed some sriracha sauce, the mushroom flavor mixed with the miso was amazing. 
Will definitely come back here to try out the rest of there menu!"}
{"text":"I came here for the regular menu on a Friday night. Made reservations ahead of time but when we arrived, the place was only half occupied. 

We ordered Uni sashimi and I got the Boku Maki. Food arrived fairly quickly. Uni was delicious and fresh. The Boku Maki was honestly pretty average - the rice was slightly too hard and the maki as a whole didn't taste like anything special. The pieces were also on the smaller side.

The \"deal breaker\" was the guy serving us. We would constantly hear him raise his voice - the restaurant does not give off the \"loud izakaya\" vibe, nor did other servers talk loudly. I honestly thought he was drunk. We asked for the bill and waited for a good 15-20 minutes. When we checked up on our server, he was chilling by the sushi bar talking loudly again. We reached out to a girl who worked there for the bill and it came right away."}
{"text":"This place was so overpriced for what we ordered. We received a sashimi plate of 12 pieces and and 16 piece basic sushi tray for $80.   Never again.  The sushi was ok not even great."}
{"text":"Came here after dinner and dessert for drinks. This place has the right lighting and mood for a night cap.

I got the mango cocktail and takowasa (raw octopus with wasabi). The cocktail wasn't my favorite, it was more sugary than I wanted, but then again, I should've known since they use flavored sake. The takowasa was excellent! This was the first time I had it and it was an entirely new window of flavors for me. The brininess of the octopus contrast with the mild spice of real wasabi was an umami treat. Warning: the octopus was chewy (don't worry, I'm sure it was fresh); however, I still enjoyed the mouthfeel. 

My friend got hot sake, which I had a sip of. It came in a hot water bath and handmade clay bottle. SO good! I will get the hot sake next time.

I will stop by Boku to try other items off their menu if I ever go back to Toronto again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening for an anniversary dinner. The place was at 75% capacity, and there were only two waitresses. As a result, it took 20 minutes for someone to even come to our table. Another 20 minutes to get our beverages, and an additional 20 minutes after that to get even one plate. We kept a menu in hopes that we could order more as we went since we were really hungry, but after the wait times we stuck to only a few dishes. As a result, we didn't really get to try as much as we had hoped. The miso soup and agedashi tofu really stood out. The wakame salad, squid and uni were good, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Been here twice because my friends know the owner and wanted to support him.

The sushi was good but really pricy. Interesting menu. Lunch items are cheaper so if you work in distillery give it a try.

I wish they offer the tohenboku ramen (owned by Zuimei as well) items and deserts here."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was terrible. Staff is not friendly and we were rushed during the whole dinner. Bad experience!"}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating.

Came here on Valentine's day for dinner, Apparently you can't order their normal omakase on the menu on Valentine's day, either you order the Valentine's day omakase or a la carte. My boyfriend and I went for the a la carte choice.

Aburi Flight ($36)
Aburi Sushi, aka hand torched nigiri. The set comes with Saba, Beef, botan Ebi, Salmon, and Hamachi, 2 pieces of each fish. This place is supposed to be well known for their aburi set (torched sushi), but i found this slightly disappointing, Usually sushi places marinate their fish slightly when it comes to aburi, but here there wasn't any additional flavor other than the raw fish being torched. The fish was fresh, but i suppose I was expecting a bit more flavor.

Tried 2 of their daily special menu items:
Black cod - this was really good. This was grilled nicely, loved the skin. The meat was so soft and tender, it almost melts in your mouth.
Braised pork - I thought this would be served like pork short ribs, but instead it was a giant piece of pork belly. Lots of fat along with the meat, not too much of my liking.

Ordered a la carte sushi:
Toro sushi, my favorite (market price)
Unagi sushi ($6 for 2 pieces)
Hamachi, yellow tail ($8 for 2 pieces)
Tai, sea bream ($7 for 2 pieces)
All the fish was really fresh - definitely enjoyed the nigri sushi.
They said they ran out of Ameabi (sweet shrimp), so instead they offered us to try the fresh live scallop sashimi. This was nice - you can taste the freshness. It came plated with the shell as well so the presentation was nice.

Unashiso Maki (8 pieces for $15)
This was a disappointment. Prior to coming I was hesitant about this place considering it is located in the Distillery District, I had a feeling the restaurant might not be as authentic. I thought otherwise while trying everything else until came this roll. I suppose the other explanation could be they don't specialize in rolls? The roll just had a lot of rice, with a small piece of unagi (bbq eel), and for $15 I would expect a better presentation on the roll itself.

Overall the food was great. Don't think I would come back as there are other better sushi options at this price."}
{"text":"Great lunch menu, amazing service, make sure you save room for dessert, their cheesecake is the best I have had in TO.  We ordered tempura don, chirashi and spicy maki set for lunch, all the lunch came promptly and tasted great.  All of the staff was helpful and courteous.  Check this place house if you are visiting the distillery next time!"}
{"text":"Boku is short for ??? (Touhenboku; \"idiot\"; if related to the ramen franchise, is a whimsical reference to the owner's mixed heritage). My girlfriend and some friends came here on Valentine's Day for the first time. The dining space reminds me of a cross between an izakaya/sake bar and a beer hall with raised wooden communal tables.

Two of us ordered set dinners while my girlfriend and I split a boku maki, aburi flight, and wagyu aburi nigiri. It's clear that Boku places stock in aesthetics, with all orders arriving attractively plated. However ultimately, we agreed that the quality/taste fell short of their presentation, as well as the expectations set by the price tag.

Of note from my friend's set dinners, the tuna tataki was a pleasant little salad and a good opener. The lobster tempura felt rubbery and bland, relying heavily on the batter. The anago oshizushi was not bad, but we felt that the rice was too densely pressed and way too firm in the mouth.

Of the aburi flight, I felt the shrimp was the best in exhibiting the freshness of the protein. The salmon, mackerel, and hamachi were borderline above average, and the beef, unremarkable. Where we were truly disappointed was the wagyu aburi. It tasted like a well-executed medium rare steak with a good sear. However, for something marketed and priced as \"wagyu\" (whether true wagyu or otherwise) we expected an extremely tender chew bordering on melt-in-your-mouth experience, for which it fell sharply short. The Boku maki (for which carries the restaurant's namesake) was okay. Lightly seared, a bit too much rice, and too much sauce, but still enjoyable and well put together.

It's difficult for me to comment on whether I'd come back, as I hadn't tried the sake or any of the sashimi/raw nigiri. Overall for this particular experience, I can only say that there are many alternatives that come to mind, whose corresponding offerings at the same price point are of a noticeably higher quality."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant from the creators of Touhenboku Ramen! It's so underrated and a lot better than Miku in my opinion. 

Food: 4.5/5
Service: 5/5
Atmosphere: 6/5 
Would come back? Yes

What I ordered:

1. Kitsune Udon ($13) - The best udon in the city and also the best udon I've ever had! The broth was so fresh, tasty, hearty and did not have a single hint of processed taste. The dish is very simple - noodles, broth, seaweed, mushrooms and fried bean curd. The fried bean curds were thinly sliced fried tofu with a hint of sweetness - amazing!! I was worried that the dish would feel incomplete without meat, but the tofu made up for everything. 

2. Aburi Flight ($40) - 2 x 5 varieties (10 pieces total) of blowtorched nigiri. Very impressed with this - the ratio of fish to rice was good and they blowtorched it just right. Many sushi restaurants now have blowtorched sushi but not many get it right. 

3. Salmon Aburi Hako Sushi ($18) - Excellent blowtorched salmon on rice. I actually prefer Boku's aburi over JaBistro's because the flavour is less in-your-face. Thumbs up to Boku doing a great job at box pressed blowtorched sushi!

4. Pork Katsu ($14) - Flavour was mild but hearty. 

The restaurant's decor was absolutely beautiful and they have a gorgeous sake collection on the wall. This is definitely a date-worthy spot!"}
{"text":"Best, most authentic and creative sushi in Toronto. Also made by a real sushi master from Japan."}
{"text":"Great sushi but at a price. Nice atmosphere though. My partner and I enjoyed the mackerel sashmi the best - unique fishy taste. Fresh sashimi."}
{"text":"Sashimi is very fresh with many choices and excellent cuts. Sushi is rich in flavors and full of textures. Service and environment are great. Very nice experience."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place while walking around on Valentines day while enjoying the light displays around the distillery district. At first impression the staff was very professional; he quickly offered us seating at the long tall tables, and offered water. I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant; soft dim lighting but still bright enough to see, displays of katana and huge sake bottles line the back wall behind the bar counter. 

Unfortunately, the impressiveness stops there. As a table of 4, 2 of us ordered the set dinner menu, and my boyfriend and I ordered boku maki, aburi flight, and wagyu aburi. The dishes came priced, decorated, and plated like a high class restaurant, but the taste was quite lacking. The boku maki was heavy on sauce, I couldn't even taste the scallop or tuna. The slate of nigiri aburi we received was meh; boring and expensive. Lastly, the biggest disappointment was the wagyu aburi nigiri. The slice of wagyu that came on top was fully cooked and seasoned with some bbq sauce. It tasted like a piece of tender beef short rib, not the usual melt in your mouth wagyu. At $11 for 2 pieces, it was heart-wrenching. I expected more. 

All in all, the price tag that came with this experience was not worth your money. There are plenty of other restaurants in GTA that will offer better food for the same price point."}
{"text":"Apparently just opened, sort of...more like rebranding change from sushi to noodles...normally not how I like to roll into a restaurant....I prefer places that have already worked out their kinks...well, sometimes I'm wrong...and Boku is where I went wrong...between the most comfortable bar stools on this planet and my cups of house sake (get the cold, it's pear bites are perfect on a hot summer day) is a glorious plate of Takoyaki and a steaming bowl of mushroom ramen....whatever this place feels they need to work out with the menu I hope they keep both these items!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to check this place out during Winterlicious but it was all booked up so quickly! So I was surprised to see the restaurant half empty on Valentine's Day..

Anyway, it's conveniently located inside the Distillery which makes this a huge bonus year round - whether you're checking out the Christmas Market, Light Fest, or just going for a stroll in the summer (pretty big patio outside btw), you can now be able to grab really decent sushi right away!

So my lovely companion and I tried the Tai Aburi Hako, Aburi Flight, and the Boku Maki. Skip the Boku Maki - it tasted like your regular ayce sushi roll with the exception of having a nice piece of Albacore Tuna at the top. For $15, this was quite pricey for what you're getting. The Aburi Flight was ok - the rice was not up to par as your other similar sushi joints and the piece of wasabi inside was a little too overpowering for some of the pieces. The fish however, was quite fresh, but the beef was not a good cut. Overall the Aburi Flight was ok - although double the price, definitely prefer Miku's! The dish I liked the most was the Tai Aburi Hako - box pressed and torched sea bream with pickled cherry blossom, quite delicious!

To end it off we got the matcha creme brulee and it was sooooo much better than what Jabistro made for Kinkalicious. Their matcha creme brulee was nicely paired with a sesame snap and a strawberry. Definitely would recommend this to end off your meal!

Overall, pretty great sushi joint at a great location! However if you're just looking for good quality sushi, I would prefer Miku. Would probably come back if they're going to offer a Summerlicious menu and if I can grab a table!"}
{"text":"Craved sushi & sake again on this vacation to Toronto.

I love the Distillery District--modern, upscale shops and restaurants.  My speed!  Decided to return to the DD for lunch.  This was a great decision!

Much better experience with the sushi at this spot.  

Loved the decor--tableware had a hand-made look.

Loved the service.  Server was softspoken and helpful.  Conscientious.

Liked the sake list -- name brands (Hakkaisan, Kubota Manjyu) mixed in with others I am not familiar with.

Loved the torched nigiri!  Soo much that I ordered another it again.  Then again!  Great char flavor takes the nigiri to another level!

Sushi rice in Canada still not up to my par (compared to Japan or even home at Hawaii).

It's been a month since I returned from my vacation and I am craving their torched nigiri!"}
