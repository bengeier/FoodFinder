{"text":"One of the best fish places! Its not the fanciest place to go to! But Amazing prices compared to others! The menu selection is limited but u get what u pay for! Best for calamari, fries and shrimps too!!!"}
{"text":"amazing food! went there with my mom, sister and boyfriend we ordered fried fish, fried calamaris,shrimps and salad and rice as sides dishes. 
The rice was okay, but the salad was incredibly delicious!! we finished it in .5seconds ahhah. For the main courses, the fried fish was dry and somehow tasteless even with the lemon they provided. However, calamaris were fresh and tasty (on Marven's level) and we liked the shrimp sauté with garlic. 
I have to say that the customer service was poor and the staff not really helpful. thank god my boyfriend knows about fish, because when i asked about their selections, the clients' fav, best way to eat each fish etc they didnt seem to know about it and/or care. Also at the table, water was served once, had to ask for more and even had to grab fork for an other table cause we were missing 2.. on a table for 4....."}
{"text":"Restaurant Rayan is definitely a spot I'll be returning to in the near future. The service was a bit shaky - I attribute it to their ordering and serving system, but it's not anything that can't be easily fixed, no points deducted. The garnish (Za'atar) that found its way stop of all our dishes was undoubtedly Mediterranean/middle eastern, the distinct taste of parsley, nutmeg, oregano and other aromatic spices highlighted all the flavors nicely. A lot of people are weary of seafood, and that's only because of the associated smell. When seafood is fresh, it doesn't smell fishy, and Restaurant Rayan's catch is so fresh that when they went to sleep the night before, it didn't know it was going to meet me the next day."}
{"text":"absolutely love this place.

I didnt pay for it so i'm not sure how much it costs but the food is amazing.

amazing calamarie, shrimp, potatoes and skate fish

definitely recommend! the best food ever. so fresh and yummy!"}
{"text":"The food is really good but the service sucks. The waiters lack respect. Always in a hurry and barely greet any customers. They are not friendly at all and makes you feel uncomfortable and unwelcome."}
{"text":"I like the concept but the food is limited. The only option on how to cook the seafood is fried and grilled. What happen to steam or adding soup? Also, everything was too salty for me. We ordered salad, yellow rice ( they don't have plain white rice) , fried calamari, fried stingray and grilled fish. Everything has this green powder. So basically, everything tasted the same."}
{"text":"Went there early with the family on a Ramadan Saturday evening (this restaurant is obviously Arabic and possibly Muslim owned). Hence it was very busy.

It was our first time there and simply waited next to the entrance to be seated.  We were told by a passing waitress to go to the back of the restaurant and order our food there.  We obediently did so and stood in line next to the fresh fish and seafood counter.  There are no menu or prices anywhere in sight.  Hence when you get to the counter they ask you what fish or seafood you want,  how much of it and how you want it cooked (grilled or fried are the only options).  

There were 4 of us ordering and every single time the guy tried to put more than what we ordered or give us a larger fish than we pointed to. We were then given a choice of steamed vegetables, rice, potato wedges or salad as side dishes.   They gave us a number on a plastic card and told us to go get a table. We headed back to the seating area not knowing whether to just grab a free table or wait for someone to seat us. A waitress saw us and showed us to a free table.  Within less than a minute another waiter/manager came and told us we couldn't sit there as we had no reservations and to go stand in line across from the ordering counter to get a table. There were 5 or 6 persons already waiting.  It turned out they were all waiting for take out (this may have been a hint).  Approximately 5 irritating minutes later the waiter/manager signaled us to come and sit at the exact same damn table we were moved away from.  
When I told him their process didn't make much sense and was rather irritating he didn't seem to give a rats ass.

Thankfully the food started to arrive quickly. Unfortunately it probably took about 25-30 min. to get all of the plates. Hence some of us were almost finished eating and others just starting.  The tables are quite small and we had to juggle the food from plate to plate so that it would all fit.  When we asked for more lemon or water it took 10 to 15 minutes to get them.  It was obvious they were severely understaffed when the restaurant was about 90% full.

Now the good part.

Every dish was delicious.  The 2 fish were very fresh and grilled to perfection. The fried calamari was amazing and the sautéed shrimps nicely seasoned, cooked to perfection and very tasty.  As for the side dishes, as noted by other reviewers the potato wedges are heavenly.  We actually considered ordering some to go despite the huge quantity they had served us already. The salad was crisp and fresh and came with a wonderful dressing on the side. The steamed veggies, that also came in a very generous portion, were cooked perfectly.

When we apprehensively asked for the bill we were relieved and very pleasantly surprised.  The prices were not only fair they were actually on the cheap side.  With all the food and beverages we consumed it came out to about 20$ per person. I don't know of any other places to get such large portions of fresh and tasty seafood in Montreal for that kind of money.

In summary if you enjoy fresh fish and seafood, and don't mind the process being a bit annoying, this is definitely a good place to eat.  

I, do mind the process. Hence I may only go back when I get a craving for these potato wedges...cause I just know I will eventually get one."}
{"text":"Unclean establishment and rude service. You will however get ripped off at the weighing counter when ordering fish to which they are only too happy to overcharge you by over piling on the balance. 
I'm a fairly young individual and found the seating difficult and uncomfortable. Stay away."}
{"text":"The place loses 2 stars for outdated furniture and service. 

We had interaction with three people.
The gentleman was pleasant. 
The lady at the cashier wasn't. 
The second lady wearing a Hijab was excellent and courteous. 

We ordered fried fish and grilled fish.
Stick to the fried fish. 

The salad was superb"}
{"text":"It is a 4/5 for the actual food. The food is well seasoned and generally fresh but the visual aspect is a little low. I mean if youre a foodie and want to eat a good seafood meal, heres the perfect place for you but not the case if youll want to take  a picture to put in any social media (why not but still). 
It is a little expensive but its seafood what do you expect ? 

Oh and the service is okay. It is in the unorganized side, it is awkward when you first enter because theres a restaurent and a fish market (?) in the back and i still dont know if im ordering the food correctly still today.  And yes you should study your seafood game before going there."}
{"text":"The way of ordering is super weird. There is no menu. You choose your fish. They charge you by the weight and add $4 cooking charge per fish. Then you buy sides of salad, rice or fries $6 each for a small, $8 for the large ones. At Least, that's what I understood from what they explained. We were three people. We ordered one baked tilapia filet, half pound grilled salmon, half pound garlic shrimp, half a pound fried calamari. One small rice, salad and potatoes. We were relieved to know that the total bill was $62, including tips. So, not bad. Now the food. The calamari was really good, even though fried, but it was not drenched in oil. The fishes were perfect. The garlic shrimp was too vinegary. The sides were pretty average. If you enjoy eating fresh fish and don't mind the ordering system, this is a good place. However their drinking glasses were pretty dirty, all of them! If you prefer cleaner utensils and glasses, better decor and service, \"La sirene de la mere\" is probably a better choice."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place but I was terribly let down. The octopus cost $24 (before tax) and it tasted off. My husband had a couple of bites and then felt nauseous. Also, the shrimp was not worth $20. The fries were good though, and the servers were nice. Overall, I would not come back and will never recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant. You get to pick the fresh sea food you want. Their food is good. I would recommend getting deep fried calamari."}
{"text":"Cet établissement offre un vaste choix en terme de type de poissons et fruits de mer - normal pour une poissonnerie non ?! Même moi qui ne suis pas à premiers abords la plus grande fan de poisson, j'ai eu l'eau a la bouche dès mon entrée dans le restaurant ! Mais autant que le goût et les odeurs peuvent être accueillant,  le coût quant à lui vous laissera peut-être amer !

Le concept est simple, en fait théoriquement :  Dès qu'on arrive, on se dirige au fond de l'établissement, là ou la portion poissonnerie se trouve ! On choisit les types de poisson ( Tilapia, Saumon, Hareng, Maquereau, vivaneau ...ect ) et/ou Fruits de mer ( crevettes, calamars, moule..ect) que l'on veut consommer. Ensuite , on sélectionne les plats d'accompagnements tel que une salade, des pommes de terres, du riz ou des légumes ! 
la personne au comptoir, calcule ensuite le coût de chaque sélection et condiments par rapport à la quantité que vous avez choisit auparavant et vous remet un ticket à présenter à la caisse pour payer !

La dernière étape s'agit du paiement et de l'attente! Vous pouvez choisir de manger sur place ou d'emporter le tout. Attention, comme il sagit de poisson et de fruits de mer, l'addition peut vite devenir coûteuse ! En exemple, j'y suis aller avec un ami et à deux on a chacun choisit un poisson + des crevettes et des pommes de terre et  enfin riz, notre facture a ainsi facilement atteint une cinquantaine de dollars  pour des portions moyennes et raisonnables .

La dégustation fut agréable et j'ai particulièrement apprécié les crevettes sautés à l'ail mmhhh (flashback ) ! En général tout était bon et convenable, je ne peut pas me plaindre pour le goût !

Petites mentions:
- Mon ami et moi avons préféré prendre à emporter car l'endroit débordait de gens et il y avait beaucoup trop de bruit !
- Mention spéciale pour la personne au comptoir poissonnier qui a pris le temps et a eu la patience pour nous expliquer le concept car c'était notre première fois !
- Le service était rapide!

En général , disons que j'y retournerais une fois a chaque 2 ou 3  mois car mon budget ne pourra certainement pas supporter cette dépense de façon régulière ! Par ailleurs, mon indifférence pour le poisson s'est maintenant transformé, grâce à ce restaurant en une petite curiosité et même une envie de poisson de temps en temps ! Gros plus !!!

Je recommande fortement !!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start with this place.

Never have I thought fried fish could taste so good. I was never a fan of calamari but oh boy their deep-fried calamari were delicious! Their seafood chowder were delicious and the fries were nicely seasoned with cajun spices. I never tried the grilled fish, but it doesn't seem as appetizing as the fried ones.

The service was mediocre, nothing too much or less. I like how they give a jar of water per table so you can refill your water as often as you'd like.

The reason why I am taking out two stars is because of the hygiene. The second time I went there the utensils weren't properly washed, and the water looked cloudy. The fish aren't really that fresh and are not kept on ice.

Nevertheless, the food is still very tasty, and I will return again and again to satisfy my needs for more fried seafood."}
{"text":"I strongly recommend this restaurant/fish market for those who are fanatics of freshly prepared seafood or fish dish, or for those who would like to taste the good mix of oriental spices prepared in their dish!
You have a variety of fish and seafood that you can choose to get on served on your table.
The seafood was very fresh tasting and perfectly prepared, delicately fried calamari and shrimp, sweet grilled oysters that you can accompany with rice, potatoes or salad.

Not the place for a relaxing or romantic experience.
On busy evenings, the atmosphere of the place can be very noisy and hectic but if you go on day times there is less noise and you hear the Arabic background music.

Overall, excellent food, prices are just right for the quality and freshness of the dishes, was served up quickly, and our waiter would assure that we enjoy our food."}
{"text":"Je n'ai pas tellement eu une bonne expérience! Certes, c'est du poisson frais. Certes, on choisit son poisson sur place, ainsi que sa cuisson. Mais c'était bondé de monde, les chaises et les tables basiques, pas très chaleureuse place, aliments d'accompagnements (légumes, riz....) pas très savoureux... Pour un prix assez cher: 30$!"}
{"text":"mmmm if you want a nice seafood meal, go here! But, keep in mind that (a) the seated area of the restaurant isn't very nice, (b) it can get really REALLY expensive, and (c) you pay more for the better non-pita bread. The service has never been amazing, but has never been terrible either..... mediocre might be the best word to describe it. 

How it works is that you basically walk in, pick your fish from a fridge/freezer type thing, tell them how you want it cooked, and then take a number and sit down. Everything is very fresh, but the ambiance isn't really nice...

So basically, fresh and yummy with mediocre service and a not-very-nice seating area. Try it out; if you like seafood I'm sure you'll be pleased with the food!"}
{"text":"Good food. Pricey. So busy. Fast service. Only cash.
If you care about some decent sea food with yummy fries snd a salad with a secret sauce (making it taste just right for the setting) then come by. You may end up sitting squeezed at some small tables with chair set back to back to maximize customer service (quantity) as we did on a Sunday evening. But the service is rather quick. I dis not expect a bill in 60s though but did not feel guilty! The price tags are a bit misleading and you need to discern based on your sense of how much a fish weighs!!
Probably visit more but I have some equally good or even better alternatives too."}
{"text":"Un peu cher, très salé! Leur salade en accompagnement est délicieuse:) le service pas toujours courtois..."}
{"text":"I really wanted to eat here, but we were never greeted when we walked through the door.  They also don't take debit/credit cards according to a sign on the wall.  We walked out and stopped in cafe Basilica next door and had a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Totally weird!! I have never been to a restaurant that has no menus, no prices, no descriptions for anything. You have no idea what is going on. Everyone else seemed to know what was going on except me and my wife.

We saw all sorts of interesting things being delivered to tables, sweet potatoes, seafood soup, green salads. I have no idea how much any of it costs or how other patrons knew about these items.

For example the seafood soup, is it red? White? Creamy? Full of vegetables? Plain fish broth? Is it $300 a bowl?!? This place is very very strange.

I would not recommend this place I would not come back.

I have never left a bad review for a place with OK food before. This place is weird and very difficult to try something new or chef inspired"}
{"text":"Undoubtedly the best seafood I have had in Montreal ! We were a group of ten and ordered various dishes and shared....simply awesome. Definite 5 star resto !"}
{"text":"What a marvelous experience.  Our party of four was the only non-local
in the restaurant. A fresh fish market with gleaming fish of every kind.
You pick your fish out over the market counter.  Note, you need to have someone who speaks a modicum of French. Our friends went ballistic not having a little French at their command. Everything turned out well. The fish are glistening fresh and are prepared to your order.  You also choose vegetables at the counter.  The owners are Egyptian and my Salmon was prepared with traditional Dukkah spice. Just perfect. I spoke to  the owner and he explained the spice was Dukkah a traditional Middle Eastern spice  You purchase your fish by the pound and then they present your choice family style.  Most women customers wear traditional Moslem headwear.
The owner was courteous and at first said they did not accept credit cards but then relented  For a uniques dining experience visit Poissonnerie and Restaurant Rayan.  A must if you want a unique dining experience."}
{"text":"This is a spot for seafood lovers who don't care about decor or service beyond the basics. Food is mostly what I care about so I was pleasantly surprised after passing this restaurant probably over 100 times. 
We ordered grilled octopus, garlic grilled giant shrimp, a fried whole snapper, rice, and salad. Each preparation was well done and I loved the herbaceous notes: parsley, za'atar, and in the olive oil (you can find pictures by others, I was too hungry to think of it). The process seems maybe a little odd to a first-time client but it's easy: go to the counter in the back to pick your seafood and sides, take your number and find a table, wait for your food! The sauces on the grilled items is also good for dipping using the complementary bread. Service is basic but courteous, so don't be intimidated by something new - give it a shot!"}
{"text":"PROS:
1. The food's SO good. The salad had a really nice dressing with a crunchy bite to it. The potato wedges were probably the best fries I think I've EVER had. No joke. The fish was cooked perfectly, not overdone or undercooked. 

2. I enjoyed that you get to go in, pick the fish you want to eat and choose whether it be fried or grilled. The employee there knew which ones were better fried/grilled. 

3. The restaurant is family friendly, bright, clean, and doesn't smell like fish as you'd expect.

OVERALL:
-I'll definitely go back and recommend it
-Worth every penny!

ps. They only accept debit/cash."}
{"text":"Hands down, the only place in town (that I know of) offering a typical Alexandrian fish store experience, and sublimely so!

Very interesting selection of fresh fish and sea food, cooked however you choose. The place has no menu: you go in, pick out which fish and/ or seafood your heart desires, then give cooking instructions, and have a seat.

The fried calamari are a must have, although a more authentic marinara sauce would have been greatly appreciated (whatever was there felt like ketchup). Never have I ever been served under- or over-cookd rubbery calamari - always perfectly cooked, with amazing breading.

On our last visit yesterday, we kept it simple with a serving of grilled jumbo shrimps, the fried calamari, and garlic mussels.

Outstanding experience all round, as always.

As unpretentious as an Egyptian fish restaurant gets, Rayan has been offering consistently amazing food (gotta try the potato wedges with sesame and herbs and the fried calamari) in a truly authentic and sober setting.

Don't expect anything fancy though: Alexandrian fish restaurants are generally very austere in the décor department, but what Rayan lacks in aesthetics is more than made up for in food quality and customer service."}
{"text":"A ridiculously expensive restaurant for no good reason. It's a loud,  garish place with lacklustre decor and dirty tables. We had the shrimp, the fried calimari and one other fish dish. The bill was upwards of 150$ which was ridiculous for that restaurant. I will never go back."}
{"text":"I love when a restaurant redeems itself! After the whole ridiculous experience last year where I showed up with my family with a reservation and the restaurant was suddenly closed, they offered me dinner on them this year. So I took them up on the offer since I really do love and miss their food (I've been anywhere between 10-15 times over the years).

As explained by a few reviewers below, the way the restaurant works is that after you have your table, you choose your fresh seafood by the pound at the back of the restaurant at the \"fish market\" like area. You can also choose sides and soft drinks (there is no alcohol at this resto). You sit back down with a number and await your food, and you pay at the end (cash is better here).

My go-to's are the fried fish (tilapia), the garlic sauteed shrimp, the deep fried shrimp, the yellow rice, the salad, the potato wedges with the red and white sauces, and the grilled salmon with lemon. Another yummy option is their fried calamari. The food arrives family style and is meant for sharing in large groups. It's affordable, delicious and fresh. 

The restaurant isn't much to look at but hands down, they serve the most delicious and well priced seafood in Montreal. We love it and I will go back."}
{"text":"Best calamaris and the shrimps are very delicious too. The red snappers were also good! Potatoes and rice are also very tasty. The waiters are not polite at all and try to squeeze as many people in a table. Food is great, service is terrible."}
{"text":"This is a busy, crazy place on a Saturday night! If you don't mind crowds and the search for a parking space, Rayan is a good place for some delicious fresh seafood. Recommend to make reservations in advance because it is a popular place for families.

There's a reception table where you first check in, then head to the back to pick your seafood: no menus just point, say how much you want and how you want it cooked (fried, grilled, steamed, sauteed in butter). Order your sides (http://restaurantrayan.com/en/menu/). Take your number put it on the stand on your table and they'll bring it out to you. 

WE HAD:
- Grilled Octopus - tender with a nice char
- Battered and Deep Fried Calamari - tender inside and crisp on the outside.
- Breaded and Deep Fried Scallops - HUGE tender scallops with a delicious breading.
- Grilled Salmon - Thick filets that were cooked perfectly.
- Jumbo Shrimp sauteed in butter - always my favorite. Make sure to ask for the complementary bread to soak up the delicious sauce.
- Yellow rice - nice, fluffy and tasty.
- Salad - fresh and delicious.

Make sure to eat the scallops and calamari while they're warm or else they'll get chewy;  the octopus stayed tender throughout our meal. You don't have a designated waiter so you can ask for help from anyone. Leftovers are packed in aluminum containers."}
{"text":"Its a must for anyone with a large family , filled with traditional middle eastern spices such as dill and parsley.The calamari is very good and the grilled octopus is to die for.A straight forward restaurant that allows you to buy food based on the quantities you need."}
{"text":"Very bad treatment and bad attitude we were two and wanna try everything they have he was pushing like old bazar thirsty to sell maximum normally our bill go more than 120$ but he think that we take one or two item 

The way they treat it was awful and it was so hungry 

Just politely we said thank you and left !!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best seafood place I've been to in Montreal, Especially if you love freshly prepared seafood.  Think of this place as a seafood market. You order the Fish / lobster / calamari etc by the pound, and you tell them how you want it to be cooked. You have an option of getting it fried , grilled or pan seared. The Calamari is amazing, fried of course. So is the shrimp in garlic butter sauce. Also ask for their hot sauce. It has a nice zing to it. For sides they have two kinds of rice, steamed veggies, dinner rolls, Potato wedges and salad. Did I mention its not too expensive? No alcohol here. Also they accept cash / debit, but no credit.


Food : Great
Service :Fast
Ambiance : Casual
Worth the price : Yes"}
{"text":"This place has the freshest seafood at very reasonable price. This is a family place and very casual.  Not fancy."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Especially the Cajun shrimp and the fries. Service is good or bad depending on the day ."}
{"text":"We visited the restaurant with our family on a Saturday night while on a visit from Toronto.  We were seated within 10 minutes after tables had been rearranged to accommodate our party of 8. The  entire main dining area was packed. 

As we seated, I asked the manager (could've been the owner) on how we order. Been to the restaurant years ago (2008) I remember that you have to pick your fresh seafood. There are no menus. We picked calamari  ( fried), tiger shrimp  ( sauteed in garlic) and seasoned fillet ( fried) from the back fish market. You buy in weight and prices are listed like at a butcher's. We also ordered salad, rice and fries as our sides. 

As soon as we came back to our tables, our salad arrived. Salad was simple but well seasoned with lots of salty olives. We finished the first plate so quickly, had to order a second one. Soon after the rice and potatoes came. Fries are really seasoned potatoes wedges fried to perfection. Next was shrimp in garlic sauce. Its a bit of work to take the tails off but was worth it. They were succulent and cooked perfectly. Calamari was lightly battered and fried. My kids couldn't stop eating it. 

The prices are a bit steep but you are a paying for fresh seafood cooked as per your order. We would definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Montreal is full of eating places, but when I wanted to find a nice place for me and my kids for some seafood, I found this particularly one. For a seafood lover it's the perfect place. Imagine if you would walk trough a seafood market, where you can choose between fresh fish, shrimps, calmars, whatever you like. Well it's quite the same here. You come, you go to the fridge and you can choose you preferred seafood, the quantity and the way to be cooked: with garlic or tomato sauce.  They cook it right in front of you and they serve it with rice or potatoes. One of most delicious dishes I suggest you to order with your seafood is the vegetable salad. It was fresh, juicy and very delicious. The shrimps were extraordinary, also the mussels. I missed a beer(they don't serve alchool, actually they don't serve anything else, just seafood). They could have at least a desserts' menu, but even without it I suggest you this place with all my heart."}
{"text":"This place is pretty casual and especially unique if you like seafood. I walk in with a friend and am immediately directed to the back where i am instructed to pick fish and seafood from the display. There is a pretty large selection of fish on offer. We ended up choosing and entire sea bass which they grilled for us with vegetables, calamari, tiger shrimp and a small bowl of rice. There was a bit of a discrepancy with the cost advertised and the actual cost $/lb but i thought u would let it slide. Chef in the back was not very helpful if you have a question which leaves you a bit clueless. He also seemed to be rushing for no particular reason, there was no line behind us? 

The food came and it was great the fish was fresh and the calamari was crunchy with just the right amount of batter. Our waitress was ok but overall i was more impressed with the food than the service. For a bill over 75$ for 2 i would expect both."}
{"text":"There is no instructions here and no menu, so here's the low-down: walk to the back of the restaurant where the fresh fish is behind a glass window, choose a type of fish you want (which can then be baked with spices or deep fried in batter). You can add veges to the fish as you like. You can also get shrimp in garlic sauce or deep fried, and you can get calamari and lobster as well. Then you order side dishes like rice or potato wedges (which are amazing!) and then take a number and get seated. All of the seafood is charged by weight and cooked without an extra fee. 

We tried the turbot fried, the basa baked, the garlic shrimp, the calamari, the rice, and the potato wedges. Everything was really really delicious (except the rice was quite plain, but worked with the baked fish). Definitely would go back the next time I go to Montreal!!"}
{"text":"Great place for the best seafood in town! 

I love the fried/grilled calamari and the shrimp is to die for.

Be careful however when ordering a pound of something and having half of it cooked one way, the other half another. They don't advertise this, but there is a $3.50 cooking fee for every technique you order. That REALLY adds up! Best to go with a big group of people! Other than that, the decor is 'arabic' family style, but the food definitely makes up for that!"}
{"text":"I was wondering why the rating was so low but I get it. There were a few reviewers that came into the restaurant and didn't know what was going on and decided to go to another resto. That's a bit unfair to rate a resto poorly just because of that imo.

So here's how this concept works:
1) Make a table rezo by phone (it may be busy on weekends) OR if you get there early and there are free tables, just grab a table. 
2) Go to the back of the resto to order
3) Menu: order by the pound anything you see at the counter and then the cook method for each item. a) Deep fried b) Grilled c) Sauteed

Recommendations: 
- Pick a fresh fish of your choice and the cook. TBH, I've not found THE fish to choice yet...so if anyone's got recommendations, I'm open to hearing it!
- Calamari deep fried--this is a staple
- Garlic shrimp sauteed (this makes the garlic sauce get into the shrimp meat)
- Grilled octopus--so tender and delicious grilled flavor. You absolutely must try this!!!
- Potato wedges (small or large) these are so good, you won't regret getting them!
- Salad (small or large) very fresh with cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, lettuce
- Seasoned Rice (small or large)
- Free bread
- Ask for extra lemons cause that goes with everything

Take a plastic number card associated with your order and head to your table and display the card on the holder. The waiter will bring your food to you. 

The seasoning that they sprinkle generously on everything is so good!!!

Pay at the cash by stating your table number. Be careful not to mix up numbers otherwise you might end up paying someone else's table, which is what happened to us! Happily, the cashier recognized the error and corrected the isssue. Always good to double check the bill for the food items you actually ordered!"}
{"text":"All the great reviews really are true about this place. The fish is amazing, the calamari is a must, the shrimp is good (but peeling it is kind of annoying) and the salad is great. The waitresses are helpful and smile a lot. The gentleman at the fish station are on a mission to know what you want however, if you are friendly with them and crack a joke they tend to enjoy that. The food really tasty and cooked well. I was so full after my meal and I really enjoyed the experience. I can't wait to go back and try new fish."}
{"text":"Amazing and very reasonably priced seafood. $100 for 5 people and we were stuffed ! We ordered a bit too much calamari, salad, potato wedges and lots of fish. The fish was fresh and delicious and well seasoned ! Careful, the white sauce that they give you has lots of garlic ! I would come back again !"}
{"text":"Minimal decor, bright lights and utilitarian tables - don't let this dissuade you. Or do! Then the secret won't get out...ha ha! The back of this restaurant is basically a fresh fish market. My eyes widened at the selection of fish, crustaceans etc. I am a fan of all things seafood so this was a little paradise...plus you can order in a number of ways depending on your taste or craving - fried, grilled, breaded with their special herbs, poached etc. 

I read through the reviews and can only surmise that they've come a ways in terms of service and quality as everyone who greeted us at the door, seated us and helped us select our fish were warm and professional. Then again, we did go around 9:30pm on a Tuesday (not exactly a busy night of the week - I imagine weekends are bananas) and there were only a few other customers left.

Everything we had was delicious - the fish, herbed potato wedges...and other tables had beautiful steamed veggies, butterfly-ed fish...I recommend it on an off-night and with a group of 4+ so that you can sample a bunch of dishes and keep it on the affordable side.

UPDATE: Went with a group of 20 and tried multiple dishes. The grilled octopus was to DIE FOR! Highly recommend. Succulent, grilled to perfection. The deep fried breaded calamari also delicious. Grilled shrimp = YES! And the steamed, buttery veggies and crispy herbed potato wedges rounded out the meal nicely."}
{"text":"Probably the best seafood I've ever had. The calamari, the mussels, the fish...everything was so delicious. The restaurant is very noisy, the concept is a little out of the ordinary and the service is... interesting. But man, the food is just amazing and makes it totally worth it."}
{"text":"Loved the sea food here. Fish is quite good too. The must try in this place are the fried Calamari. Please do try Fried Calamari with fried Tiger Shrimp fries too. 

The sides fries are a quite delicious as well, however Not too big of a fan of the rice though."}
{"text":"Its the best seafood place.  You choose the fresh seafood and let them know how you want it to be cooked- grilled, fried, baked etc.  They use a same spices (Mediterranean) to all the dishes, its a little salty but I enjoyed it. My favorite was the buttered shrimp and their salad.  I highly recommend this place but they dont serve alcohol."}

Friendly and accommodating service, and the food deserve 6 stars out of 5.
The fries are out of this world
You select the fish and ask them for method of cooking.

Grilled tiger shrimps 
Fried calamari 

Wide selection of seafood 
Whenever I'm in Montreal, I have to make this stop. 

I wish they'd open a branch on TORONTO

{"text":"Good place for seafood restaurant. You go there and choose what are you like and then they cook for you with some spices.

Place look good, I went there with my girlfriend. They give good portion of side dishes too like potato or rice.

I ordered a grilled fish, and I liked it pretty good. My girlfriend ordered grilled salmon and also not bad.

If you are a seafood lover, you should try this place. 

Their seafood look fresh ok when you order."}
{"text":"well seasoned fish, a bit overcooked, well go back again, the octopus was great, good for family meal to share everything, it is a bit out of the way but worth the detour."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food, the recipes are basic but seasoned to perfection and very delicious.  We ordered the calamari, salmon, shrimp and some kind of white fish.. all of it was FABULOUS!  My only complaint was I ran out of room (was totally stuffed) and could not eat what was leftover because we were on vacation.  We will definitely come here again, the food is spectacular if you want a simple fresh seafood meal.  Oh, CASH ONLY... and you better change your currency (to Canadian)  because you won't get a break on your price.  We loved our meal."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in, we weren't sure whether it's a fish market or a restaurant. No one greeted us, I asked if there's a menu and was told that they don't have a menu. I'm guessing that we were supposed to choose something from the fish counter, but we had no idea what were the options of dishes or what were the prices. People who were seated and eating had a variety of plates on their tables which I'm not sure how they knew of to begin with... Very confusing, unfriendly and feels like a members-only club. If you just walk in for the first time you have a feeling like you just landed on Mars and you're not sure what you're supposed to do. We walked out and had our lunch at a normal restaurant."}
