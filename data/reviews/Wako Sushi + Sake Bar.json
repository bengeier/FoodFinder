{"text":"Came here for dinner with a hungry teenager.
The bento  boxes offers a a good variety of sushi, sashimi, gyoza, tempura, kalbi.   Everyone enjoyed the sushi and sashimi.  
Overall:  good quality for the price that you pay.
I would come back again!"}
{"text":"Wako Sushi received a conditional pass from Toronto Public Health DineSafe on August 1, 2013.

I have been eating there once a week since it opened as Hiro Sushi so I am truly disgusted.

I hope this info proves useful. :)"}
{"text":"Go here for pure unadulterated sashimi experience. If your idea of Sushi is westernized \"rolls\" this is not the place for you. Funny how some below rates Ichiban higher up than this place. Ichiban is as good Japanese resto like East Side Mario is good Italian. Ok, that was a bit harsh but you get the idea."}
{"text":"Been here two times for early dinner, like 6pm. Barely any other customers were there.  

I ordered rolls and sashimi both times.
 
Rolls are decent, sashimi is quite fresh. Sometimes, I don't wanna try the Dynamite or Lobster roll, I want to try simple rolls, like the smoked salmon rolls. I tried two of their simpler rolls, and they were too overdosed with mayo. I like their more \"premium\" rolls, like the Dynamite or Lobster. I guess they worked on those a lot. 
  
Service isn't amazing; waiters are not rude, but not great. 

I would say it's reasonably priced, for reasonable quality.

I don't think I ever felt even traces of \"Omg this place is so bad\" or \"Omg this place is great\". I just feel indifferent lol Like I said, reasonable and ok."}
{"text":"The rolls are pretty good compared to the similarly priced places in the area and the sashimi was fresh the few times we went, but their udon is horrible. The soup base just tastes like water and MSG, order other stuff :("}
{"text":"Stay Away.  Fish is not fresh at all, rolls were hard like they had been sitting around for a couple days, Miso and Spicy seafood Udon soup were overly salty and the Udon was overly spicy (and I like salty and spicy foods very much).  While I was eating, I even caught one of the chefs sniffing some of the sushi fish, as if he thought it were going bad.  We both had upset stomachs for the rest of the night, but we didn't get sick.  On a good note, the service was good, although the food came out at different times as described by other reviewers.

Bottom line: There are plenty of good Sushi places in this area for the same or similar prices, and they are ALL much better.  Moto, Sapporro, and the Izakaya right across the street all put this place to shame.  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch around noon. I ordered the udon and roll combo for 11.95 and the food was pretty decent. The nabe udon soup base was very flavourful and the parkview roll was fresh. Couldn't give it 5 stars because the service was pretty slow after ordering and they didn't refill our tea at all. 

The restaurant is pretty busy during peak lunch hours but I would come again as they have a wide variety of lunch combos! Lots of options to choose from -- bento boxes, sushi combos and many more!"}
{"text":"This has become my go to sushi place since I moved into the area. Consistent quality food is always served, and it's delicious."}

{"text":"I ordered a Salmon roll today, but the salmon inside is not fresh.... It tasted bad, really disappointment!!?"}
{"text":"Chirashi wad just OK, rice doesn't have the right balance of vinegar and sweetness.  we also ordered the orange dragon roll, Just average again. There are way more better Japanese/korean  restaurant choices nearby Yonge and Finch. This is our first time trying out Wako and it is going to be the last time."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and ordered the Chirashi which is assorted sashimi on a bed of rice for $12.95. I have never experienced lower level of fish quality. I was shocked when my plate came out. The fish was thinner than an average AYCE sushi. One of my fish had a hole in it and I was concerned. I asked the waitress what was wrong and she replied back saying that while the chef was cutting the fish it just accidentally cut that way. Its impossible to cut a perfect hole in the middle of a sashimi \"accidentally\". I would probably never go here again for sushi."}
{"text":"Clean, nice music, well-mannered staff. I had donkatsu donburi, it was very delicious and also came with one of the best miss soup that I've had in Canada. I am really happy that I stumbled into this place."}
{"text":"As a Korean/Japanese fusion restaurant, Wako offers the typical menu and nothing out of the ordinary.

I ordered the udon and sushi combo for just under $12. The spicy seafood udon is actually extremely spicy! If you like drinking soup with your noodles, I don't suggest getting the spicy soup base. I was tearing half the time, and I can usually eat very spicy dishes. 

The chicken terriyaki bento was also A-OK. They are generous on the chicken, which I found to be a little tough to chew and the California roll was a bit bland. 

Though I found most dishes to be A-OK, their ingredients seem fresh. Service is also quick, but unfortunately, the menu is a tad boring."}
{"text":"Not bad! There are quite a lot of Sushi places from Yonge and Sheppard to Finch; I normally go to the one on Spring Garden but decided to venture here as it was close to where my friends live.

Modern d√©cor; love the booth seating (which is where we sat). The menu is extensive and really caters to any appetite. They also have some Korean dishes. Because I wasn't too hungry, I ordered some combo set that comes with the signature sushi/sashimi, garden salad, miso soup, tempura. You can also order the Dragon/Spider Rolls etc.../noodles/teriyaki...

Overall, this wouldn't be a top of mind place, but good food and efficient service. Glad to have this in the area (which I will be moving into next year)."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi if you want clean, fast service. Unfortunately this is the highlight. The lowlight: hardened rice on so-so tasting fillers. Avoid this place if you can. There are many better sushi places within walking distance."}
{"text":"The prices are decent- not too expensive. However, you get what you pay for. The quality is not the best. I'd rather spend a little more and get sushi that is much better quality. There are way better other options in the area."}
{"text":"Gonna keep it very brief - cheap and delicious!! Seriously, only drawback is the annoyingly repetitive and loud generic music playing"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite sushi restaurant. The waitresses are all very friendly and accommodating and the food has always been consistent. I usually order one the bento boxes since there's so much variety. The spicy salmon and tuna rolls are really good and the sashimi is always fresh and cut in thick slices. I don't really care for the teriyaki dishes but for the price of the bento box, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"now every place you see would call themselves sake bar or izakaya, but this place, I don't see anything making it a bar, don't really see an extensive list of sake or soju or any thing make you think it's a bar.

me and friends decided to try this out as I saw the post by Jen K., after a quick look at the menu post at the door, it seems to be the same thing from Hiro.
we walked in and ask if there is any place we can park for free, the waiter pointed out  that I can park on the side of the building even with the \"No Parking\" sign there.

we sat down at one of the booths, and closer look at the menu, it's your regular Korean Sushi place, you get some Korean dishes, and some of the sushi/sashimi choices.

seeing that my friend got a Korean dish (tang su yuk), and another got a Udon, so I decided to go with a Chirashi.

mine came up first, nice plate of sashimi on top of rice. (refer to picture)
the very little piece of BBQ eel, I rather they don't put it there. (or it's their way to get you order a full size BBQ eel?) two different types of seaweed on the side, and some pickled daikon and ginger. These are all a bit weird showing up on the plate.

Tang su yuk (sweet and sour pork, you can sub with chicken) comes, and it's a huge plate that obviously can't be finish by one person. it came with a small bowl of rice.
the sauce wasn't in a good balance, and the batter is a bit hard on the meat, meat doesn't have much flavor to it.

by the time I am half way done with the Chirashi and we are all well into sharing the Tang su yuk, with my friend worried about her Udon is not going to come, the waiter finally brings out the Chicken Udon.

Chicken Udon has few piece of chicken, possibly grilled, and some green onion and parsley, and very little green veg (so little that we can't tell what type), some mushroom.
as my friend is a little bit under the weather, so she uses a separate bowl to eat it. after serve herself two small bowl of the Udon, she gives up the rest, which isn't much because it has very little meat and real veg, and doesn't taste good.
she isn't full but the Udon was so bad that she really don't want to eat it. (not much left anyway)

Service was ok, but I guess the 2 wait-staff was hiding when the Udon wasn't ready. we couldn't find anyone to ask about it from the time the Tang su yuk arrived to the point they brings out the Udon. which was like almost 10 minutes.

because we were so used to being in a Korean run restaurant that we would have banchan, this place doesn't. (unless you count the miso soup and salad)
and then there isn't any dessert or fruit at the end, and we weren't asked if we would like to have any drinks with our meal (as a \"bar\" don't you think you should sell drinks?), or any dessert after meal...

the udon was 6.95, tang su yuk and chirashi are both $12.95, so it's a $30+ meal with everyone wanting a bit more after the meal."}
{"text":"Great place to go with friends. Donburi rice bowls and large selection of sushi boats are worth getting."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi restaurant in the area of yonge and finch / sheppard. The price is good and the food is consistently  good.  It has a pretty relaxed atmosphere.  The scallop rolls are the best.  And the chirashi !"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week for lunch or take out, the lunch specials are really nice from all the sushi places I've been to. Large amount of food for less than 10 dollars. Mostly there are just a few people inside, but when a large group of people come, the service would be really slow."}
{"text":"This review is only for lunch, as I've never been here for dinner.
They have bento boxes starting at 6.99 (chicken teriyaki), and most of the others are 7.99 or 8.99.
I had the bulgogi bento box @ 7.99
It was quite good coming with a miso soup and a bento box, containing a salad, 2 gyoza, a huge portion of bulgogi which was marinated quite well, and some deep fried chicken with rice.

I would definitely come back to try the other lunch specials!"}
{"text":"I usually order the Supreme Bento combo from here whicb consists of 6 salmon rolls, tempura, salad, miso soup, and choice of terriyaki salmon or chicken.  All of this for the super low price of $12.95 plus tax.  It is pretty decent combo for that price and you definitely will be full.  As for the quality of the food...well that is 3 stars for sure.  However...what do you really expect for $12.95 for all that food?

The restaurant has a decent set up with 2 tv's where you can enjoy a meal and watch the Jays game.  The service here is okay and not too bad at all.

If you are looking for cheap sushi or korean dishes, wako is the place go."}
{"text":"\"We have been aWAKOed for some Wako....but it was jus A-OK\" - Let me have some \"pun\"

I have been wanting to try this place for a while and now that Izakaya and Asian Legend have closed down, and forever having a craving for Asian food, I came here. 
And of course, I go during Happy Hour (happy prices for a happy tummy!!!). 
I ordered a Don Katsu while my friend ordered Chicken Teriyaki. They both came in bento boxes that came with a salad, chap chae (if I did not spell this correctly, I apologize), one gyoza, two sushi pieces, miso soup, and rice. 
I liked how the sushi rolls weren't just cucumber or california rolls. My friend ordered the larger set I believe since it came with a sushi roll and tempura.
My friend said the miso soup wasn't as good as other places however, I don't think you should expecting too much from the side dishes during Happy Hour. Then again, the soup is probably loaded with salt and MSG anyways....

I was also surprised at how the restaurant was predominantly non-Asians, despite the Asian population in the area. Most people seemed to have come during their lunch break from nearby offices. 

Pros: service was very good. The waitresses greeted us immediately and were friendly. Although they would talk to each other, they would quickly leave their conversations to serve customers. This is no surprise but I have been to restaurants where waitresses would continue with their conversations although they see that you are calling for them.

Cons: Food was mediocre. I am referring to my don katsu (pork) in particular since that was the main dish. It tasted soggy and not fresh. The meat was also very thin and sliced. I would've preferred if it was sliced/cut but not disassembled into the box. Unfortunately, I do not remember the price but I assume it was worth the price...

P.S. They have two TVs here. When I was here, one was playing a sports channel and the other was playing TVO kids...but there were no kids inside the restaurant lol. I personally didn't mind and found it rather hilarious. 

Since I visit the area often, I am hoping to their their special sushi rolls and go for dinner."}
{"text":"Always fresh! Right around the corner from my house, I visit this place frequently. A young sushi master runs this place. Prices are decent and not as crowded as Sushi Moto down the street. You should definitely try it! Also they deliver through Foordash."}
{"text":"3.5/5 
Price is cheap to decent for the quality.
Ordered salmon salad $8 - good number of salmon and salad size. 
Spicy seafood udon & Parkview roll combo $14 - roll was good, udon was average.  
Service was good."}
{"text":"This place has been here for years, and it's not exactly legendary. I had never heard of it even though I have lived in the neighborhood for over a decade. A solid place to go for sushi. 

Pros
Shrimp and veggie tempura $8.95
Deluxe bento $14.95
Parkview roll $7.95
Spicy tuna crunch roll $7.95

Cons
No brown rice for sushi available which is my preferred choice for rice. 
No storm door to keep out the cold. 

Damage - $44 before tip"}
{"text":"I come here if im ever craving a good bowl of udon noodle soup but other than that i wouldnt order anything else. The quality of their sushi is poor. Usually the rolls are different sizes and stuff is falling apart. The sashimi is usually hit or miss as its not always fresh and cut evenly. The restaurant is never usually busy so service is fairly decent. 
One other plus, they have lunch combos between $10.00-$12.00 including a udon soup and roll combo for $11.95.

However, the last time I came here and ordered the beef udon, I was pretty disappointed, the soup was not steaming hot like usual lacking flavour and there was barely any beef. Don't think i'll be returning again."}
{"text":"Was hiro sushi before. After it change to wako. I don't want to go back anymore. Tho they offer pretty much the same menu but the food quality decreased!! And the food just sucks!! since I had always been a regular customer to hiro sushi this is a big disappointment !!"}
{"text":"The lobster sushi roll was very tasty. The sauce went well. The salmon sushi can use some improvement, it wasn't bad not not that good compared to other ones down the street.

The spicy salmon roll was good. Hot sake comes in small, medium and large. Good ambiance and not too busy on a Monday night. Will come back for the lobster sushi."}
{"text":"The food here was not bad, and the lunch specials were well-priced with lots of selection. However, we waited a long time for our food, and when we asked our server about it, she laughed it off. It was a bit off-putting, and she didn't seem very apologetic. Overall, I wouldn't recommend going here if you are in a rush. Otherwise, it isn't a bad option."}
{"text":"Sushi here is always very fresh and they have an extensive menu.  The bento boxes are a great value with lots of options.  The salmon dome is a personal favourite of mine since I always get a salmon chirashi elsewhere and have to pay to upgrade to all salmon.  The service is excellent and it's very reasonably priced.  The Korean ribs (Kalbi) is excellent with the bento boxes."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings - love the food there, so good, but service 80% of the time is wako. Go there from work for lunch/birthdays/etc - they barely can handle large groups. Last time even two of us were waiting for some simple rolls for 30 mins! 
But again, for food taste/price balance - something had to go and that is service :))"}
{"text":"Came here after a Blue Jays game as we were looking to grab a bite to eat and stumbled here on the recommendation of a friend who's been to this restaurant before. It was nearly closing time so it was basically just us dining in on late¬†Tuesday evening in Koreatown.

We weren't too hungry so we decided to order a small sushi boat to share. You get about 46 pieces or so for about $40 shared amongst 4 people which is about $10-$12 per person which hisn't too bad. Sushi was made and rolled fresh. Pretty¬†good sushi place. The boat also came with salad and miso soup which is nice. Service was good. Nothing spectacular about this place but the quality is decent. Nothing bad to really say about this place.

Overall, pretty decent place for sushi! Would love to come back if I'm in the area to try their sushi dishes!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a tuesday night around 7.30pm. It is a short walk away from the North York subway station. There were plenty of tables available, a table of 2 was no wait at all. The tables were spacious, clean and the place was quiet enough for conversation. Service was nice and attentive. 

I got the Take Bento box with salmon teriyaki, for $15 you get quite the variety of food it comes with tempura veggies and a shrimp, salmon sashimi, gyoza, few pieces of sushi, miso soup, salad and white rice. The portions were good and I was very full after. The food itself was ok, nothing amazing. The salmon teriyaki was the run of mill in the bottled sauce but the sashimi fish did feel fresh. It's not a bad place but I just probably wouldn't choose here again with the other options in the area."}
{"text":"I'm going to bump this up to 4 stars. 1) Sushi is pretty decent and you get a lot if you order a set meal. 2) They have san nakji. What's san nakji? Sal da means \"to live\" in Korean. Nakji means \"octopus\". The adjective form of sal da is san. So San nakji means \"live octopus\". I think they only have this available on weekends. And it's not for the faint of heart. Imagine a living octopus quickly chopped up, while alive, and then thrown on a plate. And served. Pronto. We're talking legs still wozzling and meezling around on the plate. 

Dip in some sauce, toss it in your mouth, and chew the shit out of it. Seriously. You don't want those legs fighting as they're going down your throat.

Service was quite friendly when me and the beautiful Ms Brooks Brothers went."}
{"text":"Really good sushi here! I walked in around 6:30pm on a Monday and the restaurant was quite busy. I was seated right away and took some time to look over the menu. I ordered the agedashi tofu, red dragon roll and spicy tuna crunchy roll. All three dishes were full of flavour, and very nicely presented. My favourite was the red dragon roll - I will definitely return to have this again and try some other dishes, too."}
{"text":"One of the most underrated sushi spots around. The lobster sushi was out of this world. Will definitely come back, they put an emphasis on quality!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my family. We ordered the sushi and sashimi small combo, and some a la carte rolls.

The server was very friendly and made sure we all had soup and salad. The rolls are quite decent in size and definitely tasted fresh! Surprisingly all the food was quite filling for the small amount we ordered.

I would recommend coming here for sushi and their sashimi is of the higher end as opposed to AYCE restaurants."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be Hiro Sushi but they changed over the names but the menu is pretty much the same. 

As Jennifer K mentioned there is a lot of selection in terms of rolls but my favourite there is the Udon Combo which includes a selection of udon (5 choices) and a choice of rolls (also 5 choices). It's a good deal for $10.95 and the rolls come with 8 pieces. It's my go to choice whenever I dine here. I usually get the Spicy Seafood udon with Willowdale Roll or Parkview Roll (I forgot what exactly is in it though). 

The sushi is fresh and I am never disappointed whenever I go here and this place cannot begin to compare to Ichiban. The service isn't bad but could improve, the place is run by Koreans but they are friendly and the wait on food wasn't unbearably long. I frequently dine here with friends and would recommend to others. 

Give a try it can't be bad considering the prices are pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"I came here multiple times over the summer for a quick sushi fix during lunch. The service is quick and if you order ahead, the food is always ready when you arrive. 

I always got either the veggie roll or the veggie dragon roll and both were delicious. The dragon roll has avocado and spicy mayo on top which is absolutely delicious. And when you get it to go, they pack it really nicely with all the essentials."}
{"text":"I was surprisingly pleased with my bento box here at Wako. It tasted fresh and the portions were good! The thing that surprised me the most was the quality of the fish. They had some good cuts and the fatty salmon was like butter. 

It wasn't the best there is, but it was a great find since I am not a fan of most sushi places in the northern part of the city. 

The prices are not cheap but they are reasonable. The staff is stylish and prompt. The booths are pleasant. 

In the \"north of sheppard\" category I place this restaurant near the top of the pack. 

The reason I don't give it a 5 star is simply because there are better sushi places, although they are generally more expensive and downtown. 

Definitely give it a try guys! I recommend starting with the sushi bento to get a good feel of the place or one of the rice/fish bowls"}
{"text":"Downgrading the rating one star. We came here for lunch again and asked for the salmon sushi pizza. Tons of sauce was on the top even though we didn't ask for it. Hubby ordered one dish which he hated the taste of so they took it off the bill. I don't think we'll come here for lunch again. The food was underwhelming this time."}
{"text":"I don't like leaving bad reviews, but this place is nothing to write home about. If I were craving Japanese, I'd much rather go to Ichiban Fish House located at 15 Spring Garden Ave, which is about 850m south of Wako. Rolls and Wako were ok at best. I didn't like the rice and the salmon was not A grade. This place is probably ok for lunch if you work in the area, but then you have Ajisen, 2 Ichibans, Sakura, Pho88 and some other Asian restaurants. A note to the owners of Wako: pay a visit to Japango or Yuzu No Hana and see what quality food at a Japanese restaurant tastes like. As to myself, you won't be seeing me back, I'm afraid."}
{"text":"Simply put..
A decent place for a decent quality of food at a decent price. 

Nothing spectacular, but nothing bad to mention either. 
I would come back if I'm craving a bento box or rolls when I'm in the area.

Service was good!"}
{"text":"i went here yesterday with my family. ordered a wako bento (~$24) and sashimi boat(i forgot the name, the combo price is around $44). the wako bento contains sashimi, tempura, kalbi, sushi rolls and matcha ice cream. they were all freshly made and taste really good. the staffs were attentive and nice, i will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Wako used to be Hiro... Hiro used to be.......?

Now a sushi sake bar with a Korean only menu for people that read Korean...secret live Halibut menu!

You will be happy if you are into rolls... rolls of rolls.. I found menu a little boring.....

- Miso soup ($1.50) 
- KaKitama Soup ($3.00)

- Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll ($6.95)
- Rainbow Roll ($9.95)
- Spider Roll ($9.95)
- Shrimp Tempura ($7.95)
- Ika Yaki ($7.95)

Food is decent.. service is efficient..

I found the rolls on the smallish side... and I think I need to eat a lot of those to be full... Maybe those friends I was with ate all the rolls while I was busy taking photos."}
{"text":"Nice sushi, polite service. They have Sapporo by the pitcher, which my husband loved. Pretty standard offering for the price range. One thing that kinda irked me was that every Asian person who came in got a huge chorus of Korean greetings from the staff, whereas when we walked in it was silent. Eventually the hostess put down her iPhone long enough to seat us but it still annoyed me just a tad."}
{"text":"Love this place! Ate there two evenings on a business trip. It's cozy with excellent fast, friendly service--and great food! Really enjoyed the Green Dragon Roll.   :)"}
{"text":"I got some take-out lunch from here.

The sashimi lunch which included:
12 pieces of sashimi, spicy salmon roll, miso soup, salad and rice for $12.  It was a very good deal.

Lemme break it down:

QUALITY
Fresh sashimi and good variety.  My combo had my favourite fish, butterfish!
Rolls were well made, not loose and mushy.
Miso soup was good not too salty.
Salad was pleasant with a ginger vinegrette.

SERVICE
Good service even though I was only takeout.  The waitress offered a seat and some tea.

LOCATION
Convenient with street parking and a parking pad at the back of the building.

I am yet to have dinner here, but the prices are good and the quality is so far good.

Looking forward to return."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to update my review on this for a while.  Rating wise it's still the same because there's still some *slight* inconsistency on the cooking quality of their dishes.  The price you pay for and the service you get matches well and isn't too expensive at least for lunch.

In addition, for those who have a low-carb diet they are open to changing your dish to remove the rice and put in place salad.  I've had their Kal-bi lunch plate with the rice changed to an extra salad and their chirashi/salmon don changed to be on a bed of lettuce instead of rice.

As far as inconsistency goes, it is very prominent on the kalbi, which on occasion can be very tough.

For lunch this feels less heavy due to the lack of carbs wanting to put me to sleep in the afternoon.

Their miso soup still has some MSG though so I try to avoid that."}
