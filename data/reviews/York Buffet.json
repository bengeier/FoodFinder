{"text":"Their sushi was better than average and hibachi grill was fast. My favorite roll there was the one resembling a dynamite roll. Loved it. Shrimp cocktail was good. And really liked the salt and pepper squid. Fruit was fresh. Chicken skewers were tasty. Thought the crab legs could've been a little more fresh and there were a couple dishes with imitation crab I didn't care for.  I'll definitely come back for the sushi and seafood."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! Food is plain, hard and utter shit. The food doesn't even look decent. I felt sick to my stomach and got food poisoning. Workers don't pay attention to the guests. This place doesn't deserve a single star, but I can't post this without at least one star. If you want to eat at a buffet, go to any other buffet besides this hellhole. ANYWHERE ELSE IS BETTER!"}
{"text":"one word. UGGGG!  Food was barely warm at best, and taste was mediocre to bad.  $25 voucher for $15 is only good for dinner only, although web does not say anything about that."}
{"text":"The York buffet is my lunch destination when I have a clear schedule in the afternoon, because I tend to gluttonously eat myself into a food coma.  Who can exercise self-restraint when there's all you can eat sushi?  Ok, so the food is not the best Asian cuisine you can find out there, but it's available to you in unlimited quantities!!  The lunch price is definitely worth it, and they have all the same options that they have during dinner.  The staff is always very attentive and great at clearing plates and refilling drinks.  Definitely try the hibachi!"}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant another try and I'm glad I did. I got there around 3pm. I ate sushi and broiled fish.  It was excellent .  I will be back ."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed to have watched York Buffet slip. They started off well, immaculately clean and a nice variety of food. They never really figured out sushi though, they had a poor selection and didn't refresh it very often so even those who love sushi tended to avoid it. I tried crawfish there one day and they had put them out all frozen inside. They have several kinds of dim sum but the wrappers are all too thick and heavy. Similar issues with several other dishes including the soups which were \"gloppy.\" Add this to complaints voiced by quite a few that they were overcharged, as I was, with claims that we ordered drinks that we didn't. Now that Misaki buffet has opened on Rt 51,  York has more competition to deal with and they need to improve overall by perhaps 30% to be competitive with both Misaki and Tokyo buffet in the north hills which are presently better choices for an Asian buffet."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I paid 15$ per person for dinner on a weekend night. Food wasn't  bad... Just not worth it. Not a huge selection too for the price. Also, there was no background music in the dining area so it felt kinda awkward eating in silence... Especially for 15$ a person. I'll be going elsewhere for Chinese food. -Justin"}
{"text":"I visited York Buffet on two separate occasions, once for lunch and the following day for dinner. There was a wide selection of food choices for both lunch and dinner. On the dinner menu, the prime rib was well made and tasty. There was also a \"creat-your-own\" stir fry with a wide selection of options for choices. The bacon-wrapped shrimp were excellent as were the soups and noodles. The sushi choices were tasty (there are more \"high-end\" choices for dinner sushi than lunch, including shrimp-wrapped sushi). On the negative side, you must dissect the peel-and-eat shrimp... heads and all. For someone not used to having to tear apart a shrimp, it can be an off-putting dining experience. The evening I was there, the crab legs were utterly unappetizing, bland and flavorless.The crab rangoon was hard, giving the appearance and texture of having sat on the buffet line for a long time. For dessert, the \"apple pie\" was tasty as was the pineapple cake. Overall, I will venture there again for dinner, but with a selective palate of their dinner choices.  Positives: selection, sushi, bacon-wrapped shrimp, create-your-own stir fry, prime rib and meat cut to order, large dining area with lots of space  Negatives: peel-and-eat shrimp (must be dissected, heads and all), crab legs, food left for too long in warmers, prices for \"special occasions\" does not equate to better food or food choices"}
{"text":"I made my first visit to this buffet on March 30, 2012. The building is very nice with great decor. It was also very clean. The buffet had great variety. If only the food quality matched it. First the good news. Oysters on the half shell are pretty rare at chinese buffets, and these were cold and plentiful. The sushi was fresh and very good. On the main buffet tables, many items were not so successful. The deep fried items were all terrible. Vegetable egg roll had a decent taste, but the roll was very greasy. Other fried items were simply inedible. It seemed to me like the fryer was not hot enough, so the cook left everything in a long time to compensate. Other items were a mixed bag. Cakes on the desert table were to dry to enjoy, but the macaroon cookies were good. Ice cream was very good and there were plenty of toppings. However, one of the toppings was faux JellyBellys. They were simply too hard to eat. I won't be back."}
{"text":"1/7/2017 stopped and ate with my family (2 kids and hubby).  Total bill was under 40.00.  Food was fresh and very good. I'll come back when on this side of town."}
{"text":"Ehh. The food here is so so. Not too appealing. Would like to see more salad options. Crab legs are always out. Sushi isn't too bad for a buffet."}
{"text":"The most unfriendly service I've experienced.  I tried it here twice and both times experienced the same cold & disdainful attitude from both the hostess and servers.  Sorry but this one is a thumbs down."}
{"text":"Completely mediocre. Went there for dinner on a Saturday night, so you'd think they'd be stocked to the max. Sushi options were very few and most were not very exciting. (I saw nothing with tempura, one of my favorites.) They seemed to have a lot of buffet options, but nothing was amazing. Pizza and mozzarella sticks seemed out of place, but I guess they're aiming to have something for everyone. The price is nearly $10 cheaper than some other buffets I've been to, but I still won't go back. Oh, and the kicker was receiving a wrapper full of air as one of our fortune cookies."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Nothing was fresh, replenished, or even the right temperature! Husband and I left after multiple failed attempts at finding  something edible.  $50 down the drain."}
{"text":"This is basically an upgraded version of a Chinese Buffet plus some seafood and American food. For 14.99 dinner price I'm not very satisfied with the food they offer. They did have some tasty dishes (like fried shrimps and crap meat) but the majority of the others were just so-so. The restaurant had the word \"sushi and grill\" displayed outside, but they didn't look attractive at all. For just a few dollars more you can get much better sushi at Hokkaido. Their salmon tasted so awful that almost made me vomit. The desert was also bad. The only thing I really like about this restaurant was their staff, much more friendlier than any Chinese Buffet I have visited. But their food wasn't that impressive."}
{"text":"This place is a dump. $17.99? The food was so so. The AC was broken. The chairs had paint? peeling from them even if you just pulled it out. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We found ourselves in the area on Father's Day and hadn't intended to anywhere for dinner. It's usually cheaper, but they jacked the prices to $17.99 for their special of \"buttered lobster\"... mostly shell and overcooked meat, that's what it was. Lol ripoff.   This is probably the worst Asian buffet in Pittsburgh, though they don't really explicitly advertise as an Asian buffet, I suppose. There is indeed 1/3 American stuff, lots of fried stuff, pizza, wings, chicken skewers, chicken nuggets, etc. And sushi, a hibachi grill, and the rest are Asian buffet stuff.  The overall selection is pretty limited, even for dinner. And it's not exactly quality over quantity vs the other buffets, either.  I was able to try a bite of pretty much everything, and 90% was off in some way. Most of the dishes were very bland. If not, then weird texture. The fried stuff tastes kind of frozen.   And how do you screw up kimchi? It looked over-fermented, which I usually love, yet has zero flavor. And the soapy-tasting beets - that's how you tell a salad bar is mediocre. The sushi is pretty awful, too - stringy fish with awful texture. The sashimi doesn't seem to be freshly sliced - and why are they those tiny thin pieces instead of the big square chunks? Meh. The rolls were okay, but completely unmemorable.   The upside is that the restaurant is clean and brightly lit, and while nothing tasted GOOD, it was pretty fresh. Lunch seems really cheap - it's probably worth a cheap lunch, but not a $20+ dinner."}
{"text":"The good:   It's clean and new looking. The service is good (it's a buffet).   The bad:   The food.   I have never been to a Chinese buffet where every item I tried tasted bland and horrible. Well, that's what you will find here at York. I must have tried 15 different items.  Oysters to salads to soups to crab legs. You name it, I tried it in search of trying to find something, anything, that tasted good. How do you mess up snow crab legs!?!?!  I suppose by sitting in the hot water the whole time, rather than being warmed by steam. I never met a crab leg I didn't like, until this place. Absolutely zero taste. Like eating mushy tofu. Hot & Sour soup....no flavor. Oysters....fishy with no flavor. Fresh fruit....dried out and flavorless. Chicken teriyaki...you guessed it, tasted like eating paper.   I wish that I had listened to the earlier reviews. However I felt that it's a Chinese buffet, surly I could find something edible. I went in with low expectations and still left hungry and disappointed.   This place really stinks."}
{"text":"A friend and I recently had lunch at the buffet and while some things seemed okay initially - the pork dumplings weren't the worst and the chicken with broccoli was serviceable. The general tso's chicken tasted old and like it had been sitting out for ages. And there's a bunch of Americana fried crap. But that was not the biggest problem we faced.  My friend got the coconut chicken. She ate one piece and didn't like it. When she more closely examined what she was eating, we were repelled to find that there were several little black hairs in the chicken.   We notified management, obviously, and the young man who came over said \"that not hair\" immediately without even looking. And then when he looked closer, he walked away. So a decent place would comp your meal and profusely apologize right? Wrong. He came back, threw a Pennysaver magazine on our table, and said \"here you take coupon for your lunch\"  We were disgusted. We did separate checks and my friend gave me one coupon for my lunch, which was also the worst. Our old friend rushed back and yells that it's one coupon per table. Nowhere on the coupon does it say one coupon per table. This is a repellant act and this place should be shut down. Who behaves that way after knowingly serving their customers pube chicken?? We paid our bill, even though I was this close to just walking out, and left this awful place a distant memory. Do yourself a favor and stay the hell out of here."}
{"text":"Atrociously bad.   This should get a 1 star for taste quality and flavor.   The freshness is bad even by buffet standards.  They shouldn't be able to call this shit sushi. The lunch buffet sushi is awful. Terrible rice.   The seafood table had oysters that tasted rotten. I put it in my mouth and immediately spit it out. The shrimp cocktail was not cleaned.   I've only been one time and it was cheap. Less than ten dollars for the lunch buffet.   I will never come back.   The decor looks like it used to be nice, but it's run down, dirty, and torn."}
{"text":"Dried up hot food....questionable seafood laying on piles of ice...about the best I can offer from my visit here is the waitress was great & the wonton soup broth was tasty..."}
{"text":"I am not normally one to post a negative rating, but I will make an exception for this place. First allow me to explain that I have visited this restaurant MANY times in 2013 in their first year open; back then, they were my favorite Chinese buffet! It used to be beautiful, the food was excellent, and I would haven given it 5 stars.   The restaurant has aged 10 years since 2013 and none of us enjoyed ANY of the food we tried. It was off to a bad start before we walked in the door and were assaulted by a vile odor coming from the trash bins near the entrance; then there was all of the worn-out furnishings and poor food presentation. None of the food had much flavor, there was not steak-to-order on the hibachi grill, and there was no premium sushi on the sushi bar.   The food was not worth 1/2 of what I paid for it. We will not return... You would be well advised to pick a different restaurant..."}
{"text":"Subpar, mediocre at best.  Floor is very sticky answer slippery.  No egg or spring rolls.  Really second rate experience.  Won't  be returning."}
{"text":"Im new to the area so I just stopped here for a bite and it was the best sushi buffet i've ever been to. Will surely be going back"}
{"text":"The place is way too expensive for the selection.  They don't have buttered potatoes nor fried fish.  The salad bar is pretty minimal as is the hibachi bar.  The fried sushi was cold.  Just not that good of a Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"We stopped here for some dinner and we were quite pleased with the selection of food that was available. We paid $14.99/adults for all you can eat New York steak, steamed snow crab legs, baked seafood, prime rib(more like roast beef) BBQ ribs, fried chicken, potatoes, salad bar, dessert bar (which included scoop ice cream and toppings).   The food was good. Unfortunately the sweet sour chicken was spoiled! The carpet in the room to the far left looked filthy and full of stains. The service was slow and the waitress was a little unfriendly.   I gave this place 2 stars for the selection of food they have and for the price we paid."}
{"text":"Have you ever gone shopping on Black Friday and seen the people who are so caught up in the excitement that they start speed walking or running through the store?  I swear my bf did that when he was walking toward the buffet.  I judged.  hard.  The York Buffet has EVERYTHING!  You can do it as healthy or unhealthy as you want it.  Having a random craving for octopus salad?  You can satisfy it here.  I have this issue where I'm curious about all foods and have to try everything once.  So I actually did try the octopus salad.  It might have been an awesome octopus salad, I wouldn't know.  I was just freaked out that the texture of it was exactly what I feared it would be.  It was...not for me.  ANYWAY...    This is NOT some sad, dingy, filthy buffet where people go to eat their pain away.  It's really nice inside and honestly, without the buffet it COULD stand alone as a chinese restaurant.   ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI ALL YOU CAN EAT HIBACHI ALL YOU CAN EAT CHINESE FOOD ALL YOU CAN EAT SALAD BAR.  YES.  I limited myself to two plates, but I'll admit when I got to the sushi I FILLED my plate.  I had General Tso's chicken, whichw as very good, a crab wonton, which was EXCELLENT, a bowl of Hot & Sour soup which was great, and then plate of every kind of sushi.  The sushi is good.  It's not great but you are at a freaking buffet.  I'd say it is a notch up from the sushi you get at Giant Eagle, and it was very fresh.  They also have crab legs there and bc I love crab legs I tried one.  Avoid the crab legs, when they bring them out the have them in the buffet in a vat of warm water.  Unfortunately this over cooks the crab and the crab is not as good as it could be.  I'll def be back, and I highly recommend this place, especially for lunch!  Good service, too."}
{"text":"Good Food but Rude Employees! The three star I gave is for the food since it looked fresh and there were plenty of varieties all the way from general tso to sticky rice to fresh sushi rolls.  We (group of 15+) went here on a weekday for Lunch around 11AM. We already made a reservation - so we could all be seated together. We were seated in a semi enclosed room divided by a wall that was somewhat used for group dinner. Few tables were joined together in groups of 2 to accommodate our group. The tables were very wobbly so we asked one of the server if we could get another table but she simply said \"the food won't fall\" so needless to stay we took our time to get another table (which was wobbly too) and ended up fixing ourselves. When filling our water - one of us asked for a chopstick and all she said was \"it's out there\"  Would love to give another shot at this place just because of the variety they offer."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of these types of Chinese buffets over the years.  Usually they're very mediocre because it's really built upon a specific financial model of quantity, not exquisite quality.  It's not one of those super large Japanese buffets that cost in the mid to upper $20s, so you have to have a different expectation.  Here are some elements that separate it from some of the buffet factories.  First, the decor is a lot more modern, hip, and spacious than most.  Second, there were some premium meats, like an actual leg of lamb and prime rib.  There were some very nice parts that were tender, and some that were dried out.  The sushi was basic, without a lot of exceptional fish.  Nice large Shu Mai (pork dumplings dim sum).  Potstickers were OK too.  Enjoyed typical deserts of fruits, puddings, small cakes and ice creams.  Basically geared toward Western tastes, but those with more specific Asian tastes can find a few good things like sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf.  So not amazing, but surprisingly better than most such Chinese large buffets.  It appears to be in a mall area that may have seen better days.  I hope it can pick up to help this restaurant a bit more."}
{"text":"After reading these Yelp's reviews, I was a little hesitant in coming here.  But after my friend's positive comments, I decided to try it out.  I was happily surprised!  FOOD: For a $15.99(wknd price) all you can eat buffet, it was actually good!  Their nigiri sushi wasn't tasty but their rolls were delicious!  Their cold foods - small salad bar, seafood salad, shrimp cocktail, etc. were good except a few of their seafood was a bit rubbery.  The soups - wonton, egg drop, hot & sour are just like Chinese restaurants.  The dim sums and wontons are tasty too.  The hot foods - chicken & broccoli, chicken & mushroom, crab bake in half shells, lo mein, pizza, french fries, and much more.  Talk about variety for everyone!  This place used to be a lighting store, so the lights are very decorative.  Clean space and good food for a decent price, can't go wrong there!"}
{"text":"Went to York Buffet on Friday night. This place is huge and I doubt there will ever be a wait for seating. They are located across from the Robinson mall near PNC Bank. Price wise, this is a great steal. They are also BYOB with no corkage fee.  They have a bunch of different stations and the food items change as people eat. So I definitely suggest that you go back for more. We sat for 2 hours and chatted and I never felt rushed. The food was mediocre but the location is good and the place is extremely clean. The restaurant itself is bright and you don't feel like it's dirty.  If you like buffets, I suggest you try it out. They do have crab legs and a station with just seafood. They also had two carving stations with lamb and prime rib. Their sushi is not great as the rice was thick and gummy."}
{"text":"Place is decent. Great selection. Not a fan of the price. A few more dollars knocked off a plate and i would come here again. Sushi was mediocre...but what caught my eye...BACON WRAPPED SHRIMP. haha aside from the price its not bad"}
{"text":"I love a good Chinese buffet.   York Buffet just doesn't happen to be good.   The food was cold and chewy, sad and bland. The only redeeming thing in the whole spread was the Banana Cookie dessert. It's kinda hard to screw that up.   I was super excited to go here, but as soon as we walked in, it was like one bad thing after another. The table was broken and wobbled everywhere. The chairs torn and stained, looked like they were pulled from the dumpster earlier that day. The waitress quickly brought water, but it tasted gross. When I went to get my plate, I had to move three of them to get to a clean plate. Not a good sign. Tried all of the staples, rice, hot and sour soup, honey chicken, and they were all cold and overcooked.   Guess I'll just deal with the mall and hit up one of the places in the food court next time.   Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Compared to other sushi buffets in the area, York Buffet is our least favorite. Save your money and order take out!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family last night. It was their first time there and they enjoyed their meals. The food here is better quality. My favorite dish was the bacon wrapped shrimp. I was disappointed that there was no cheesy spinach though."}
{"text":"i love this place everything fresh service good nice place i will return i love fish and broccoli with chicken it is my favorite one"}
{"text":"It is great to finally see a Chinese buffet open in Robinson. This restaurant opened in January 2012, and its located right across from Sears at Robinson Town Center. Pretty traditional chinese buffet food, with sushi and a small hibachi grill as well. The decor is modern and somewhat trendy with an upscale feel. I often go for lunch, which is just $8 + drink. Selection, on the otherhand, is pretty light....not a huge variety of choices. This place has potential...but they need better selection."}
{"text":"Not really feeling this place much. It looks amazing but the food doesn't compare to the scenery. They have beautiful decorations and the salad bar is served on what appears to be a sushi boat. The carpentry and high ceilings is amazing and the patterns give it an authentic Asian feel.  Once we were seated it's buffet style of course so the waitress only brought us our waters. After that I didn't see her until I had to flag her down. The food was just sub par to me. The only items I actually enjoyed was the sushi and salad bar because of the ginger dressing. I tried food from every station and was not impressed.   The sushi was good but did not taste as fresh as some i've had at other buffets. The crab legs were completely bland, didn't even taste like crab. I love raw seafood but the oysters and mussels didn't even taste fishy but like metallic water. They had a bar with all fried foods and they all tasted like they were cooked in the same oil to the point of saturation. The chinese bar had good noodles but mostly everything else lacked good flavor.   What made this place worse is that they had two waitresses working our table. The one who brought our drinks and then one who took our plates away. When our bill came it was $3 after we used our groupon. I gave the waitress a $10 bill which i expected to receive $7 back. The waitress returned but kept the money and said thank you. I was like hold on where is our change? She simply expected to keep the money and when I questioned her she said in broken english that because the tip was for her and the other waitress that she assumed it was theirs to keep.  i think it's very rude to keep the change and not even ask the customer if they want change. Not only that their cleanup service wasn't worth the $7 tip that she basically stole. I won't be returning to this place after the poor service and even poorer food!! Save your self the $18 they charge and got to Hookaida by the waterfront!!"}
{"text":"We went here, thought it was a little pricey. Then we realized we ate a lot of sushi and the hibachi steak was great. Everything we tried was good solid buffet food, I mean you can't go to a buffet expecting gourmet."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and the food is decent. The hibaci grill is your best bet. They are not too big on vegetables. The last trip this past Sunday was very dissapointing...the selection was pcked over, most of the items were all dried out. The prime rib was overdone and the crab legs overcooked. The price was $17.00. I think that was too much for what was available. I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst dining experience I've ever had. With so much to choose from...you'd think they'd get something right...but you'd be wrong. Cheap fake fish in the sushi, waterlogged fried dumplings, super-greasy wonton soup, the brownies tasted of mint, and who puts cream cheese in a California roll? We will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Not the best.  But not that bad.  Sushi was better.  No crab legs.  Food was slightly better.  No longer York.  It's now Cho Buffet."}
{"text":"There is 'different' and there is 'the same'. Some buffets do some things differently, but the bulk of them are pretty much 'the same'. There are cheap ones and pricier ones within both categories. But the bottom line is that they're either different, or 'the same'. And I have to say that York Buffet is pretty much 'the same' as any other Asian buffet.  The only real difference is atmosphere and location.   The atmosphere is kind of sterile.   I was the first to arrive at 11 am on a Saturday, and it wasn't until I walked in the door that the guy walked over and started flipping light switches. There was no music, and aside from very minimal chatter amongst the staff, there was no sound at all. Then people started coming in, and they came in twos or fours, were seated, and more or less remained silent. Eventually, the music did come on, but it was so incredibly low, it could have been the sound coming from an Ipod earplug at the next table.  The decor is a kind of corporate-chain-Asian-pagoda-leaning-toward-trendy-but not-quite-achieving.   It's a buffet. The food is decent, nothing outstanding, but nothing bad. It's kind of a Hokkaido or Misaki 'Lite'.  They have the same sushi samplings, the same coconut shrimp, the same raw bar, the same salads, the same desserts that are still sweating from being unfrozen, the same eight ice cream flavors, the same noodles, soups, stir fries, hibachi choices, crab rangoon, french fries, and pizza...as any other 'the same' Asian buffet.  For lunch, the price was $8.99 (even though their business card I'd brought home says $7.99) or something near that, so it wasn't pricey. The dinner seemed to be  priced a bit higher, nearer to $20 on their signage, but the card reads $14.99 Monday through Thursday (with the '4' hand written in) and $15.99 Friday and Saturday after 3:30 pm, and Sunday all day (again, with the '5' written in by hand).  The staff was attentive and pleasant, but not overly friendly.   The saving grace was that they do serve Coke products, so I got my Diet Coke.  All in all, there was absolutely nothing special about this trip. It was 'fine'. It was edible, reasonable, and sterile, in a mini-strip mall in strip mall hell. Much like the general atmosphere of the entire Robinson Mall area anyway. So hey...if you're going to spend $8.99 for a buffet, and within a block your two choices are Golden Corral or York...well...flip a coin."}
{"text":"I agree with the reviewers who say this place is mediocre. We stopped here for lunch on a weekday & it was pretty empty. We checked out the buffet before we sat down and there was a pretty big variety of food, however the food didn't have very much flavor. On a positive note, we found it very clean. Just not sure we would ever go back."}
