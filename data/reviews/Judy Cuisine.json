{"text":"i am first time to go out to have dinner with my wife in Toronto city,this restaurant provide good food.but service would be do better ,And I wold be more satisfied when I pay the bill?"}
{"text":"I came in for dinner on a friday night with my grandparents. The food was good but the service was horrible. It was my grandparents who paid, and they were a bit confused about the tips. When the waitress saw that they left less than 10%. She said that 'in Canada we have 10% tips, its different from China. And that servers survive on the tips.' I know that we are suppose to pay 10% tips, and servers need tips. But that remark was uncessary and very rude. I am not coming back again."}
{"text":"Both Food and Service are  truly awful.   I agree with other reviewer. Waitress always try to sell you the most expensive stuff. She even tap my shoulder to make that recommendation... I am not used to that..   When i did not order the pricey stuff recommended by her, she walked away before i finished ordering...   There are much better restaurant in the area. Any self-respecting person should stay clear of this place."}
{"text":"Food is good but there is discrimation in this restaurant. We asked how much their abalone is. The lady server said \"very expensive\". We asked what the next table's soup is. She said it's \"Softy Soup very expensive !\" We also asked what kind of steamed fish they have. She said some name and again it is EXPENSIVE ! We were not even asking how much it costs !  We are not dumb not too understand that she thinks that we can not afford to pay for their EXPENSIVE food ! With this attitude this resto is a pass pass. Go elsewhere for courteous service with no discrimination !"}
{"text":"I've never been to a Chinese restaurant outside of Asia this authentic. It feels like I'm in Hong Kong again. The food came really quickly, probably within 10 minutes. Every dish i ordered had its unique taste to it, and you can taste the wok work in some dishes (it's kinda hard to explain but if you know it you can tell.)   What I didn't like was the waitress pressuring us to try the \"award winning\" sticky rice. Although it was a really well-prepared dish, the saltiness of the cured meats inside wasn't necessary with the other flavour-packed dishes. White rice would have been better."}
{"text":"If you are looking for fine chinese cuisine, this is the place! My family and I are always on the look-out for authentic Chinese food in the GTA and we stumbled upon this place after it was recommended by a friend. We always order their specialty dishes which include: steamed black grouper, bowl of shark fin soup, squash curry bowl with beef, sticky rice, oysters with fried milk and their walnut soup with sesame balls for dessert! Their sweet and sour chicken and general tao chicken is also delicious! Would recommend this especially since they open until late; for quality, upper-end, and FRESH Chinese food, this is the only place where you'll be able to enjoy something like a fresh fish at 11:00pm. You'll notice the difference immediately - for example the restaurant uses fresh cut fruit in their stir fry. The service is spot on, and the owner Judy and her staff always make sure customers are completely satisfied with their meals."}
{"text":"Food is great, though I found overpriced.  Service was extremely slow.  We had a table for 2, and it seemed like the staff was deliberately avoiding us.  Space is quite cramped."}
{"text":"This place has very delicious seafood and Chinese dishes. Nice surroundings, not too big of a place but not too small either, tidy and clean. Their services are okay, the guy owner is very nice but his wife is probably one of the reason to not come here. Everytime you order something, she would always force you to order something expensive although the u rejected her million times."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my girlfriend. It took a half hour to decide, but we chose to pay Judy a visit to satisfy my yelp bookmarking!   Looking at the menu outside was a misleading trove of information as we failed to notice the difference between the takeout menu and the dine in menu. Major bummer as congee was a definite craving at the time.   We ordered 3 dishes:  Golden mushroom and shredded chicken soup (serves 2)  Beef and bean sprout noodles (lunch menu)  Beef and string bean hot pot (gourmet dish menu)  Total bill with tip came out to $26  Fairly good price point given that the meal had a generous amount of leftovers and the quality of the hot pot was superb!  Our host was polite and patient given that neither myself nor my girlfriend speak any dialect of Chinese.   Score breakdown (3.5):  +ves - food(1), service(1), price point(1), and setting(1).    -ves - menu (0.5)"}
{"text":"Came up this way for a family vacation and ate our way through Richmond HIll and Markham. And what an eating fest it was!! Judy Cuisine ended up being one of my favorite places. I liked it even more than the meal at O-mei with the Live Alaskan Crab!!   It's definitely a little more home-style, but it's no dive either. We sat comfortably and were treated really well by the owner's son (owner was on vacation) and staff. The menu is pretty overwhelming, but we got through it. For the most part, everything was a winner. They have a tofu dish that has chopped abalone and mushrooms (I think) on top, that was great hit. They also have fried milk, something I haven't had in a long time. That was done well also.   But my favorite dish was their pork neck meat saut√©ed with mushrooms in XO sauce. Neck meat is actually a favorite cut for me. Just fatty enough to not be dried, and it's got a good texture to it. The mushrooms were your usual white mushroom variety. Their XO sauce is house-made. Delicious stuff. And lucky for us, they bottle and sell it ( we left with 4 bottles ). So it's a pretty simple dish. Cheap cut of meat, cheap mushrooms, already-made sauce. But the wok-hei in this dish was so masterful that the mushrooms popped in my mouth.. The meat was almost caramelized. Somehow, it wasnt too greasy either. It was a dish I savored. I will definitely go back for it. YUM!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, the service could be better.  With what they charge, I am expecting a little more.  Will I go back?  Probably not."}
{"text":"Home style. That's the word that comes to mind when thinking of this place. Means no real culinary technique, huge food portions, and personable staff.  Ok I'm coming from china,  I'm a bit picky on the food. The taste cannot match an average restaurant. Just so so taste that I can imagine my friend's mom to cook. Even the staff is commenting how beautiful the dish is and you should eat this and that. Feels like my mom was there.  Ultimately forgettable of the six dishes we ordered. But again, I'm coming straight from shanghai.  The patrons are all Chinese which makes me think it's authentic. Actually it's not. It's pretty subpar compared to any Chinese city I have been to. The staff seems nice though."}
{"text":"The food is good. It's in a good location. So if you are a person there only for the food than this place will get a passing grade in your books.   However if you want a little more out of ur dining experience, I suggest  u stay away. First off the waitress there is the most persistent one ive seen, consistently trying to sell me the most expensive dishes that I don't want. Secondly, it's one of the many few places where they change their prices everytime I go. A dish can be one price today and twice as much the next day  If it wasn't for the food this place is a total 1 star IMO"}
{"text":"Food here is alright. Nothing that stands out but they do have lobsters and the restaurant is on the cleaner side so nice to bring your families. I like their rice noodles with beef and vegetables."}
{"text":"Now this is actually a Chinese restaurant I don't mind going to! Lol. With good food and even open late, this place is definitely doing well.   I've been here for dinner once or twice, but mostly come by for lunch! That is probably what I recommend the most as their lunch menu is inexpensive and very tasty! With a variety of items, from congee to rice, and noodles to veggies, you can definitely try a lot of different things!  The place is very well lit, as it is a corner space with tons of windows. Very high class vibe as the dishes and bowls are beautiful, with table clothes. I find the bowls a bit hard to eat out of though, as hey are square shaped, and ends up being hard to eat with a spoon (rice, for example).   My favourites are the Beef Fried Rice and the XO Stir-Fried Rice Noodles. The fried rice is flavourful with a mix of beef, egg, and veggies that bring out each others flavour without being too salty. The XO Rice Noodles are great, with minimal oil, not saucy, and heavy on XO flavour, it really pairs well with any congee they would have too!  Not overly busy during lunch that you'd have to wait for a table, and the service is really great! The manager there is awesome, knows Mandarin, Cantonese, and English, and can easily help you with any questions or provide recommendations about dishes! She highly recommended a tofu for us, and it was absolutely delicious! Definitely recommend trying this place out for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place has really good food...traditional as well as innovative Cantonese dishes that are made with quality and fresh ingredients.  Food rich in flavours, light on salt and grease.    There is a regular menu and colourful posts on the wall of additional / seasonal dishes.  If you see a curry-beef-in-pumkin dish, order it as it is fabulously yummy and fun to scrap off the sauce-soaked pumpkin flesh without breaking pumpkin skin which is your serving dish.    Things to watch out for: some waiters can be a bit pushy about \"recommending\" you dishes, just smile and order what you feel like eating.  This hasn't been a problem for me, and I will continue to enjoy Judy's good food."}
{"text":"There are a few excellent dishes here. Not everything is perfect. Most of the choices are good but not outstanding.   The black bean chicken was my favorite. The fish maw scrambled eggs were very good.     Decor is simple and classic Chinese with lots of redwood but not over the top.    A little pricy but it's still one of a dwindling number of older restaurants in Richmond hill that still serves reliably good dishes."}
{"text":"Very poor services. The waitress are rude and forced you to pay them tips. No one deserves such uncivil treatments."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner at this restaurant. My family and I showed up pretty late (one of the last customers for the night), and we received excellent service and great food despite that. All of the food we ordered tasted very fresh, and we had no trouble finishing everything. In general, I got the impression that this restaurant goes for a very simple yet refined taste in their dishes. I wouldn't be surprised if some people actually found it underwhelming.. I was definitely a little surprised at how some of the dishes tasted, but I did learn to appreciate it throughout the dinner. The dish that really stood out to me was the fried sticky rice. This dish was recommended to us by the waitress, and I'm glad she convinced us to try it. I felt like each ingredient used in the fried sticky rice was balanced perfectly..not too much or too little of any one ingredient. The flavors were far from overpowering, and it all came together very nicely. I'm definitely going to try to come here again the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Don't go here unless you are Chinese. I honestly felt racially discriminated by the staff/servers. The restaurant was empty when I arrived and they completely ignored me and my family most of the time we were there. They insisted we sit in the back corner of the restaurant and every time I needed something I had to get up and ask and even then, they did not bring me what I asked for. I had to ask 3 times to get water, each time, having to get out of my seat to ask. I had to ask multiple times for spoons for the soup they served us for 4 and only had 2 spoons at the table. They also forgot to bring our rice and we waited 20 mins while our other dishes got cold before we received our rice. I have to say this was the absolute worst dining experience I have ever had. I hate to use the racial card but I honestly have no other explanation for the poor service. I watched quietly as they attended to other tables and blatantly ignored my requests for water, spoons etc."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin with this review. I have so many mixed emotions after completing my meal here.  The place is quite small for a Chinese restaurant and is shaped like an L for the table/seating layout. Even though it was small I found it decorated very well and had a nice cozy feel to it. (Plus +1)  The waitress was very nice and recognized all the regular customers. (Plus +1)  The waitress was also a good sales person and encouraged us to purchase more and recommended this and that to us. I thought most of her recommendations were good but you can tell she is just wanting us to buy more and especially the expensive items on the menu. (Minus -1)  Most Chinese restaurants for dinner will give you complementary soup and dessert but none was offered here. In fact the waitress encouraged us to order soup as appetizer. (Minus -1)  $2 is charged for tea. I have had this happened to me before at a Chinese restaurant but very, very rarely. (Minus -1)  The quality of the food and indigence is above average. Everything we ordered was exceptionally better than what we have had in other Chinese restaurants. (Plus +1)  The size of the dishes are much smaller so you have to order many more dishes to be satisfied. (Minus -1)  The price is on the higher end here but I find it acceptable because like I said earlier the quality is definitely above average.     Basil beef tenderloin $16.95 - the beef was super soft and tender and tasted amazing.   Half a chicken with sliced jellyfish $15.95 - it may look like a plain chicken but it had a nice flavour to it and went well with the jellyfish.  Scallops and broccoli $13.95 - scallops were large and fresh and once again tasted great.  Sweet and sour pork $7.95 - loved the crispiness and nice chunks of meat. I say this because most other places you will just get a small piece of pork and a mouthful of batter. Another excellent dish. (I forgot to get a picture of this....darn)  Tofu and eggplant served in hotpot $10.95 - a simple dish but also done well. I liked how the skin of the eggplant was removed.  Sticky rice $11.95 - this was one of the dishes that we were encouraged to buy. She sweet talked us into it. Normally we would have just eaten our meal with white rice but she said eating it with their specialty sticky rice would be so much better. It did taste great but for $11.95 I would not order again. There is not even enough rice for 4 people so we still ended up ordering another two bowls of white rice for $1.80 each.  Overall, very impressed with the food but to fill the stomach you must order more than normal since the dishes are so small here and this is how our bill ended up being over $100 after tax and tips for a party of four. Sorry for the long review but it had to be done."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for a long time now, although it's been a long time since I've been here for a full out formalized Chinese style dinner.    Full credit goes to Wayne C. and Jennifer K. for going ahead and organizing the Chinese New Year Feast for 2013 Year of the Snake and a *psst* nod and a wink to GTA CM, Kris.   On the menu, were specialty items - Poon Choi and Sai Gung (aka Snake soup) (Pardon my poor Anglo-Pinyin); some of the more usual suspects like honey fried oysters with deep fried milk, Pepper Salt fried ribs, and E-fu Mein and Fried rice wrappd in Lotus Leaf.  Poon Choi and the sai Gung - pricey, but over all they weren't too bad. I'm a pretty white-washed Chinese girl, so even this was considered to be exotic for me. It's worth at least trying once in a life time, even if I am not such a fan of goose feet. We had also the option to eat abalone too; which I had passed on.   Honey fried oysters were pretty good with the deep fried milk, the fried milk being beautifully melt in your mouth with just enough jiggle like jello.   The chilli salt fried ribs were excellent - salty with that chilli kick with a whisper of the grease - a standard dish but done quite well.   Next was the lotus wrapped fried rice which was pretty good am wonderfully fragrant, but I found that I enjoyed the e-fu mien a bit better."}
{"text":"Hot and sour soup is some of the BEST I've ever had!!  I liked both the XO sauce with pork neck and spicy fried chicken   There was no plastic-wear, chop sticks or napkins in my to-go order and I didn't realize there were no rice or noodles with the dishes. Little bit of a disappointment when I got back to my hotel.   Also a bit on the pricey side for the amount you get (to go anyway...). Still very good!!"}
{"text":"Wow, the food here is great!  Judy was actually our hostess and our waitress.  She's definitely great at her job, the food is delicious.  We had the Huge crab with noodles, and I'm usually a lazy crab eater and just go for some meat and throw the rest away.  I actually spent a good amount of time picking out all the meat in this one because it was just full of flavor.  I even licked up the shell because it tasted so good!.  There was a pumpkin dish that had curry beef inside of it.  Sounds kind of weird, but tasted amazing!  The beef was just so tender and juicy with just the perfect amount of curry, and it complimented great with the pumpkin."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Ate here for dim sum lunch. Small, low-profile restaurant but nicer decor. Service was had that day was very engaging (treated you like a friend). That day they offered a special: home-made \"joong\"  (sticky rice in bamboo leaf) made by the owner, $6 each, but delicious. In a Chinese shopping plaza with a parking lot."}
{"text":"Using several resources including Yelp, I've had a nearly perfect set of meals in Toronto. Today my luck ran out. I sat down for lunch at 12:40 and was one of 2 customers - bad sign. I was given some menus, but none with the $5 lunch deals I read about here. I asked about the lunch specials specifically and was pointed again to the one page I posted, with items over $10. I looked around for the Chinese menu and couldn't see it on the walls. I tried to find the photo on Yelp to refer to, but had technical difficulties. I settled on a huge pile of the fried rice they are most known for. It was fine, nothing special at all.    As I shoveled it down I noticed the ad on the table for \"shark fin\" soup and lost my appetite - I cannot believe that a place as progressive and environmental as Toronto hasn't banned shark fin menu items, which is really disgraceful (sharks are hauled out of ocean, their fins are hacked off, and they are dumped to die slowly. Multiply this by hundreds of thousands of sharks per year and you begin to understand how people are ruining the ocean ecosystem).   On my way out 25 minutes later, I saw the $5 lunch menu does in fact still exist. Just not for \"shark fin-hating whitey\", I guess."}
{"text":"Came by for some late-night eats after a long flight into YYZ.  Beef Brisket Wonton Noodle Soup - Wontons had plenty of shrimp that were fresh and tasty - Beef Brisket was okay, relatively tender - Noodles and Soup were okay too.  The ambiance of the restaurant was slightly better than average which made the dining experience that much more enjoyable! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food here. Service even better. Main waitress is able to speak in different languages. Think this place might have the best sweet and sour pork. Their seafood dishes are all good too. Super good and quick service. I'm usually here with my family and get the waitress to recommend dishes of the day. Never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great service, Authentic HK style food.  I haven't visited this place in years, but coming back, no changes, still tasted the same, AMAZING!  They give you appetizers to munch on, food is prepared in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Some excellent and very good items!!! fried oyster and fried milk are fabulous for example. Food is fresh, service is OK like in every basic Chinese restaurant.  Price can be a big surprise... fresh fish, or seafood can be good but also very very expensive and you'll have the surprise when the bill come only... entire 2 lbs fish was billed 88 CAD! thus a dinner for 4 ended up 250 CAD total. Be careful of what you order here, otherwise it is a good spot."}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant if I'm in Markham. I love that this is family run, and you can taste the difference in the food- it's made with love and care. They have some awesome hot and sour soup, so I order it every time I'm there."}
{"text":"There used be 2 locations for Judy Cuisine. One at Scarborough Midland just north of Finch and other one at Time Square (Leslie/Hwy 7) at Richmond Hill.The one at Scarborough has been closed for business for over 1 year.   I have to say this place has the best XO stired fried rice noodle roll! Much better than Congee Wong or Keung Kee any other places I been too..There used XO sauce that they made themselves and they put tons of dried scallops in!   Their congees are really good too... I love the big bowel seafood congee the best. They but salmon, white fish, scallops, abalone, shrimps, squids..  For lunch they have $4.50 special everyday has choice of different kind of stir fried noodles and fried rice. (The specials are in Chinese, so you might have to ask for translation)  All patrons that comes for lunch all served with a free glass of Soy Bean Milk.  Another good thing is it is open till 2 AM every night!!   They accepts Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"Judy Cuisine is a small restaurant that serves quality family dinner.  For our dinner, we ordered Half a Chicken with Jelly Fish ($16), Pork Neck Stir Fry with XO Sauce ($13) and a Green Bean with Minced Pork ($9).  The chicken was so expensive, and it was very good.  The chicken meat was tender and not overcooked (there was hint of red blood still).  The meat was flavoured well.  The jelly fish was more crunchy that I liked.  The Pork Neck Stir Fry was A-OK.  The XO sauce had distinct dry scallop taste.   It was not spicy.  The Green Bean dish tasted decent.  The minced pork was fresh.  It was a well made dish.  Judy heavily promotes many expensive seafood dishes, such as abalone, sea cucumber, etc..  We didn't usually have expensive family dinner, so we didn't order any.  We did order three types of sweet soup as dessert.  Let's say we would not order them again.  My overall impression is that this place is a not your everyday Congee Queen level of restaurants.  It still caters to family dinners, but the chef cooks very well and uses higher quality ingredients.  As long as you watch out for the price tags of some of the seafood dishes, you will get your money worth here.  Overall 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Hmm. The quality of my last visit had significantly diminished.   Their oyster pancake is expensive and nothing significantly special compared to going Richmond Court next door.  The flavour itself was wrong I had to use their salty fish sauce to at least make it palatable.   Their rendition of hainan chicken. Loosely translated as secret sauce white chicken is pretty much meh. The only thing that made it better was their special XO sauce.   The beef tenderloin wasn't too bad. I actually enjoyed it.  That was the only dish I enjoyed and didn't really gawk at the price too much.  The one I was hoping would be good but is the worst of the bunch is the deep fried soft shell crab. The crab itself was watery and had barely any taste. It's also pretty expensive at $22. It even needs the salty fish sauce that I got with the oyster pancake to make me even force feed it down.   They also lost the order for our yang chow fried rice. Thankfully they didn't charge us for it.   The space is really cramped. I feel like it's a fire code violation in the making.  Overall I feel like it had gone down in quality and likely won't come here again for a while. I say a while because it isn't normally like this."}
