{"text":"Good place to get real Chicago items. Beef combo is good. They have fanny may candy. Direct from chitown"}
{"text":"Looking for a tasty Chicago Italian Beef sandwich? How about a Chicago dog? Scotti's has it! They even sell Dad's Root Beer and Jays potato chips! It's a nice piece of Chicago right here in the desert. Great place for lunch and/or dinner!!"}
{"text":"Scotti's Market & Eatery was recommended by a Chicago native who was excited to have a place like this in Tempe. I stopped over for lunch to check the place out and was impressed with the overall look and many different menu items.  

Cleanliness - 5 out of 5 stars - The eatery was clean and in order, both the dining and prep areas were on point

Friendliness - 5 out of 5 stars for the hostess
The line cook gets 1 star.  He was observed eating while on the prep line and was argumentative with the customer when the order he prepared was questioned.  Yes Scotti, he was argumentative.

Food Quality - My order was not prepared correctly and I didn't have another 10 minutes to kill for them to correct it.  To the cooks defense, he did offer to remake it, but their current hot dog prep process take too much time - 2 stars"}
{"text":"When I picked up my Rosati's pizza (my favorite) a few weeks ago I was pleasantly surprised to see the owner had expanded into the suite next door. The menu there includes real Vienna beef dogs (perfectly prepared), Italian beef (tasty and juicey), Italian sausage (loved it with onions and peppers) and the Italian Grinder hot sandwich (so good it is my first repeat item). As you can see from the list I have already tried, I am a regular customer and took friends there last night. One more thing...try the brownie...it will be THE BEST you ever had...so moist..laced with caramel and topped with nuts."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere never disappoints! Steak salad and German sausage is a MUST HAVE!! Along with the Jays potato chips of course."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with delicious authentic Chicago food.  My mouth is still watering from the delicious Chicago dog and Italian Sausage. Gotta love those sport peppers.  Can't wait to return and try the other foods out on the menu.  Highly recommend to anyone looking for that Chicago style flavor in the valley."}
{"text":"I pulled in at 8:01. Doors are open. 2 people inside finishing their meal. Ask if they are closed or can I grab some takeout 

Answer No. 

Just wanted their already cold premade salad. 

Thanks. So at 7:59. I would have been welcomed."}
{"text":"So I came here based on a previous review. This place is not better than Al's or Portillo's. The beef was not the worse I have ever had but the they do use the incorrect bread/roll. I requested my sandwich be dipped but only received a side cup of Au Jus. If you are looking for something closer to a Chicago Beef just go to Portillo's.  These guys could be equally as good if they used the correct bread and actually dipped the sandwich. Also the cheese sauce should be on top of the beef not spread on the bun."}
{"text":"this is what this neighborhood has been waiting for, for a long time! excellent food and excellent service. we need more restaurants like this."}
{"text":"Delicious grinders...and love Jay's chip!!
A must for any Chicagoan. The inside looks amazing. Love the mural."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the neighborhood. Not only do they have a made to order menu, they have an excellent Chicago deli with all of your Chicago area favorites. Stop in and give them a try, the very friendly staff will take excellent care of you."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the meat salad and went back a week later trying it again.  The second time, I found the meat to taste very salty and not near as tender as the first time.  Upon reading the reviews, I thought we'd take the suggestion & try the better than most\" Mexican Food Restaurants\"  Tamale. What a joke!  They are tamales in a plastic wrapped sleeve and the taste is terrible.  It says right on the wrapper to microwave at $2.50 each.  Very disappointed in that but loved the turkey bacon grinder."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic, the Italian Grinder is amazing, love this place and the service and people extremely friendly! Two Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Cool new \"Chicago Style\" market and deli. Italian beef, grilled cheese sandwiches, Chicago dogs, salads, desserts and more. Right next to Rosati's (same owner) so you can get slices of pizza during the day until 3pm. Good for lunch or dinner..."}
{"text":"I had the Capicolla and Ham, it was delicious. The bread was fresh and the meat was plentiful. I also had the turkey bacon and havarti, it was also delicious.  Thick slices of bacon, turkey and havarti. I'm getting hungry again...."}
{"text":"Have gone there twice and both times just awesome there roast beef the best chicago dog the same topped it of with my favorite jays chips and the finished it with green river pop i liked everything i have had strong recommendation to eat here"}
{"text":"Yooooooo.... southwest grill cheese  AMAZING

Marinated beef salad AMAZING

Italian sausage AMAZING


Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Love having this new local place. The sandwiches are good. Do not miss the curry salad."}
{"text":"Third time since recent opening. Love their hot dogs and today wife and I split an Italian grinder. More than enough for both of us.  Fresh meats, cheeses and roll was so fresh and soft. Side of hot gardinara made it El Supremo. Would and do recommend."}
{"text":"The hot dogs are pretty good. I was disappointed in the Italian beef. The quantity of beef wasn't enough, the bread wasn't soft enough and the au jus was awful. I think I'll stick to going to Portillo's  for my Chicago dogs and Italian beef. Oh, and they didn't have French fries."}
{"text":"The beef sandwich is excellent. The cold noodle salads are not that great and you can't get a side of them. It has to be a entree of it which is like $8. Rip off. The lady at the counter was rushing me to order at 7pm. Then when people came up behind me(in line) she was even more noticibly rushing me. Its like me and those 2 are the only people in here, chill.. She rubbed me the wrong way. The younger lady making the food was super friendly. About 50 of their potato chip bags were expired at least 2 weeks so that probably carried over to their other food. They probably keep things past the date they should. But that beef sandwich with au jus... Soooo goood"}
{"text":"We have the Italian beef sandwiches. Service was very nice, restaurant was clean. The sandwiches had no taste, I mean if I didn't know what I was eating and I wouldn't have known. It's really too bad because I wanted to like this place, but never again. Subway has better sandwiches."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Cool market, they had Jays Chips!
Nice sit down outside as well. 
Owner was super friendly."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and figured I really should write something.

Overall the food is great.  While I haven't sampled everything I can say the polish, chili and Italian beef are all tasty.

Not much to say about the polish so I'll go into the chili.  For me it's great for lunch.  It has a decent taste and there is enough to warmly fill you up on a cold day.  Now if you are looking for something that tastes like lava then you may be disappointed.  It doesn't have a lot of heat but for me it's perfect.  I don't want to curse my existence for eating it while at work.

The Italian beef - first time I ate it in have to admit it was a little disappointing.  The couple times since have been better.  While it's not the best in town it's a good back up.

Overall the employees have been super nice.  I did see some guy get chewed our because he could not make a hot dog fast enough.  Ar least i know their heart is in the right place.

They do have several tempting deserts in the back of the store. One day I will try one.  Scotti's is now on my regular lunch rotation places."}
{"text":"I love Mom & Pop run places. Scotti's is a place where you get friendly service and they try hard to remember your name. Very classy!

I came here for a quick lunch yesterday. And, I was struck by the warm welcome and all the Chicago type vibes here - like the huge mural on the wall (photo). 

Scotti's reminds me of all those small Mom & Pop places in Chicago. They dot the landscape throughout the city. All offering their own interpretation of the Chicago Red Hot or Italian Beef. 

I ordered a Chicago style Brat Combo for $7.90. It was moist, flavorful, grilled perfectly and came with a Pop and bag of Jay's potato chips. 

Yes they have Jay's Potato Chips, but also an entire refrigerator case full of Vienna Beef goodies, including hot or mild Giardiniera, buns and genuine bright day-glow green relish. Nice!  Oh btw, don't forget to pick up a Fannie Mae Cubbies Chocolate bar on your way out.

A shout out to both Karen W & Joyce W for their Reviews and for bird-dogging of this place. Great find!"}
{"text":"Driving up McClintock out of the corner of my eye I swore I saw a Jay's potato chip sign. So what does a Chicago transplant do? An abrupt u-turn brings me to Scotti's Market on Warner & McClintock, next to the first and original Rosati's Pizza from Chicago. 

The place is authentic, products from Chitown that are hard to find in the valley. A traditional menu, my only regret was I wasn't really hungry. But, that has never held me back before. I ordered the Chicago dog, it was right on the money! The Vienna all beef kosher dog has that snap when you bite in, steamed poppy seed bun, pickle spear, tomato wedges, onion, neon green relish and mustard. Damn good dog. 

I will make a point to stop in again soon and try the other Chicago staples and update. For now, I give it two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"If you're from Chicago or not, you will enjoy their hot dogs, beef sandwiches and other sandwiches plus their desserts.  Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and love it every time I come in. They make some great sandwiches and the cannolis are pretty good too. This shop has a real neighborhood sandswich shop feel, that reminds you of the  East coast. Very friendly staff! I highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for another place to grab some great food."}
{"text":"A nice quaint little place. Good food, good service. A good variety of hot and cold sandwiches and desserts. The selection of Chicago items are likely to a plus for people who miss some of the local favorites from there that are usually available here. I wish it were closer to my house."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere with delicious food! 
Steak and pepper salad is absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"The Italian beef was delicious, not greasy. He enjoyed his chili cheese dogs. As a Chicago region native, I enjoyed the Jays potato chips and seeing the Fannie Mae chocolates. 

The desserts on display looked decadent. I wanted to try them. Maybe next time.

The register at the front is more welcoming than the rosati's side. It would be convenient to combine ordering from the two restaurants at one register for your dine in customers."}
{"text":"I was sorely missing Chicago food when I moved to this side of town. It's just not convenient to drive all the way to Portillos. This place is even better. The Chicago dogs are fantastic and the buns don't get soggy. The beef sandwich is the best I ever had. Puts Al's and Portillos to shame. Plus they sell Jays chips and Okie Dokie and ingredients to make your own Chicago dogs."}
{"text":"Transported me back to Chicago where I met and was courted by my husband to be!  Totally authentic Italian beef sandwiches.  Trust me, they do it right!"}
{"text":"Italian beef is spot-on delicious! I ordered it dry to-go with a side of au-jus and added the onions and peppers. Devoured it before I could give you a pic. 

We also ordered the turkey havarti sandwich and a bowl of chili. Love the bread they use on their sandwiches!  The thick beef and bean chili is delicious as well. Not a lot of heat, but packed with flavor. This would make a chili dog top dog!"}
{"text":"I have been on a italian beef kick lately and here is a place not to be missed. Service was great although they were not busy but very friendly. I ordered my sandwich and then walked to the back . Wow they have so much there along with the deli they have some freezers with   scrumptious looking treats. I had to order a slice of cheese cake and the brownie . I got my food to go and the sandwich was great they put the au jus on the side so it didn't get over mushy before I arrived home. The beef was plentiful although the sandwich was not as big as some other spots. and The flavor was good. The brownie was awesome it was ohhie and gooey  and very rich. I only had a couple of bites and I will have to let the sugar rush subside before I can finish. I will report back on the cheese cake as the few bits of brownie have filled my sweet tooth up. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other items that they have,"}
{"text":"What a great new find in Tempe. Was browsing yelp for a spot for lunch for the girlfriend and I and came across this place. Looked good so we went.

I went with the italian grinder and a bag of chips (the hot ones). The sub was awesome the bread was good, the meat was high quality and the Italian dressing was spot on. The Jay's chips were good loved the spicy flavor on them, they must be a brand from the midwest that Scotti brings in.

Girlfriend got one of the grilled cheeses either the bacon or the ham and gouda I don't remember which but I'm not a big grilled cheese guy thought it was good. Bread wasn't over grilled and taste was good.

Price was also really reasonable for the portions. Staff was friendly. I want to come back and check out some of the pasta salads and stuff they have in the back as a coworker says they are great."}
{"text":"Scott has added another gem to downtown 85284. Italian grinders and a host of hot food. Conveniently located and attached to Rosatis pizza. This is a must stop"}
{"text":"I am not from Chicago nor do I claim to be. However I have had my fair share of Chicago style food. Scotti's Eatery is spot on when it comes to Chicago food that I have had through my life. My wife ordered their the Italian Grinder. I ordered the Chicago Dog and Italian beef. Everything was fantastic. The Chicago Dog was a Vienna Beef Dog prepared perfectly. A poppy seed bun stuffed with all the correct accoutrements: Chicago style relish, celery salt, two hot peppers, tomatoes, onions, and a pickle. The Italian Beef was thin sliced and delicious. The giardiniera was fantastic. My only regret was that I forgot to order it wet with a side of gravy. 
The restaurant is owned by the same owner as Rosati's pizza. As a matter of fact they expanded into the next building which is where Scotti's is. They also have a mini Chicago market with deli meats, fresh pasta, and Usinger sausage. Pretty amazing. Little bit of the mid west here in AZ. I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for some Chicago style comfort food. Bonus, Rosati's pizza is next door for additional variety."}
{"text":"I am not sure where they get there bread for the grinders and hogies but it is very good.   I got the hot Italian grider with some Jays potato chips.  Definitely Chicago all the way!!"}
{"text":"went yesterday 12-22-17 around 6pm to try this place. 

the food is fantastic, ordered a couple of combo Italian beef and sausage sandwiches with the hot peppers and the sweet and with mozz on top very very good especially the bread so dam tasty. 

one thing I did notice (and I hope the owners really address this) is that in neither the pizza side of the store nor the sandwich/hot dog area did I notice anyone who was preparing food, wearing gloves. in this day and age that should be a must for anyone preparing food and during the winter months when illness is spread around that would help stop the spread but also more importantly it's just more sanitary. I am surprised this is not done, I hope it just a one time thing where they didn't have them on when really they should along with anyone preparing food for the public. just my 2 cents I imagine I can't be in the minority thinking this shouldn't be remedied.

but we will be back, the food was really good and the salads looked fantastic as did the desserts."}
{"text":"Love this place. True Chicago style Italian beef. Ordered mine with sweet peppers and hot 
Giardiniera. Asked for it wet. Simply put reminder me of home. Great au jus. Beefy but not too salty. Beef paper thin, juicy and tender. Great service. And Jay's chips!!!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome grinder! I drug my kids to Scotti's Market & Eatery to try something new. They whined about it until they tasted their sandwiches! This place was worth it and we will be back. Next time there will be no dragging and whining."}
{"text":"Called in an order on Sunday morning around 11:30... We decided on the Italian & Turkey Bacon Havarti grinders, salad duo with angel hair pasta and the Greek vegetables. Really wanted to try their Giardiniera peppers so I ordered a pint of those as well. 

The gentleman who took my order repeated it back to me and was super friendly and helpful! I sent my boyfriend over to pick it up about 15 minutes later... He came back with the sandwiches, salads but sadly, no peppers. I did get a random bonus tamale instead. I have no idea what kind of tamale it was... beef of some sort. I did try it just for fun and it was actually pretty tasty! Still didn't take the bad taste of disappointment out of my mouth though. The Italian was really good! We had asked for no bacon on the other but got surprise bacon which was melted into the cheese making it hard to pick out so that was a bummer... 

I'm going to chalk it up to still working out the kinks and try again later. I'm super excited about all the new restaurants in the area and refuse to give up the dream of an awesome sandwich place so close to home! Check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. I had the beef with sweet peppers. It was not even close to a Chicago flavor or quality. Last time I'll have that and will see if I want to spend a high price to try another one on the menu. Prices are very high here. Although the place has a nice place to sit. I'm not sure if it's worth it."}
{"text":"Everything down to the delicious rolls was just absolutely perfect. One of two places I have found in the 3 years living here that knows how to make an actual Italian Hoagie!!! Thanks for the amazing food!! Can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"My wife was hungry for a hot dog.  We had looked at this place but had never been.  We tried it, and my wife, who visits Chicago often said the hot dog was perfect, the Chicago hot dog, was perfect.  I had pastrami that was excellent.  Service was prompt and professional.  We will be back.  My wife travels once month so this is my new spot.  Well done, and most of the menu is gluten free if you give up the buns.  It is a tad difficult to find, but it is at the intersection of Warner and McClintock, northwest side, worth it."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were craving sandwiches so we decided to check this place out.  We both ordered the Italian subs and he also got a Chicago dog.  He really liked his Chicago dog because it was loaded with all the expected Chicago fixings like tomato and pickles.   We took the sandwiches to go.  I was so thrilled that they didn't pour the Italian dressing all over the sandwiches before packing them.  They poured the dressing into a to go cup so we could add it while we were eating them.  This helped me so much because I was planning to take the other half of my sandwich to work the next day.   Because of their smart packing, I was able to eat a non-soggy sandwich the next day.  Thank you for the foresight, Scotti's!"}
{"text":"Walked in there and waited for about 15 minutes while three people are in front of me in line and then the lady told me that she'll be with me in a minute and then some guy came walking up behind me and rudely she helped him before she helped me after I've been waiting all that time in line so I just walked out I will never step foot in that restaurant again that was at most rudest thing I've ever seen"}
{"text":"The best things here are the Italian sandwich, Italian beef, and the fact you can buy jays chips, even though they are over priced.  All the other sandwiches we tried seem to be an after thought.  Grilled cheese was trying to be too gourmet and the club has under cooked bacon which renders chunky pieces of fat in your mouth.  Service is great though, everyone is super friendly."}
{"text":"Prices great, food very good, homemade ranch dressing. This place will be big on Yelp."}
{"text":"This was the best Chicago dog in a of Arizona. I have tried them all. Perfect in every way!!!! My only request is that you please stick better made chips too."}
{"text":"The Chicago dogs are here! Try the one on pretzel bun. The place was really cute. Nice people."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here today really hungry for some hot dogs. The interior was cute. She ordered the Scotti's dog while I ordered two Chicago dogs to go. Each hot dog cost $4.50. We ate them at a picnic spot about a mile away 5 minutes later. Unfortunately the hot dogs were cold and the buns were soggy. It's too bad because I live in the neighborhood and would have liked to make this my regular spot."}
{"text":"Enjoy some Windy City wonders at Scotti's! They serve up lots of Chicago style favorites such as Chicago dogs, Italian beef, and Chicago style tamales. There's also a section at the counter where Fannie May chocolates are for sale.

The interior is warm and inviting and looks like a Second City deli. The tables are small and have checked tablecloths and remind me of a table Lady and The Tramp would share a spaghetti dinner at (I didn't see anyone recreate the meatball scene here though).

We ate here for dinner. There was so much I wanted to try but after browsing through the menu I felt like having something a little lighter so I had the vegetarian grinder. The vegetables in this include eggplant, zucchini, onion and tomato. The vegetables were soft, the flavors harmonious and was an excellent textural contrast to the lightly toasted roll. The roll itself was so good. When I finished it I felt sad because there was no more sandwich to eat, it was that delicious lol. If sandwich sadness wasn't an issue before, it is now for me at least! 

Service was very friendly and attentive. 

I'll definitely be back to try more off the menu. In the meantime, please help us raise sandwich sadness awareness by eating at Scotti's!"}
{"text":"Calling all Chicagoans!!! This is the real deal! The beef was on point. The Chicago and chili dogs were the BOMB! And the service was so friendly!! A new favorite!"}
{"text":"Well...yelp didn't disappoint when it came to this little gem! It hits all the positive marks! It's a happy place with friendly people to greet you upon entering. Those people are helpful and will answer whatever questions you may have about their menu. They will accurately take your order and soon enough you'll be enjoying some delicious food. Deeeee-liiish, I tell you! If you choose to dine in, you'll sit in a darling space that is well maintained and comfortable. And when you have dined sufficiently, you'll write a review thanking Yelp for another great find!"}
{"text":"I've had: pastrami Rueben sandwich, polish dog, Italian grinder and the ham and cheese Gouda. All were phenomenal. Great food and very friendly service"}
{"text":"This place is just down the street from my parents house so we decided to all go and check it out. I got the Italian beef sandwich combo. The sandwich was juicy and stacked with meat. The rolls they use had a nice distinct flavor as well which I enjoyed it combined well with the au jois sauce. 

The service was good and the waitress was accommodating to us as it was our first time, she helpfully gave us tips on fan favorite cuisines.

I also like how well decorated the place was, the mural on the wall was painted quite nice, which is something you sadly don't see everytime. Overall this place gave off a warm inviting feel."}
{"text":"Cheap and fast deli style sandwiches.. staff is friendly and the menu is basic.. we ordered the Italian beef with peppers along with bacon grilled cheese.. I still like portillos Italian beef sandwich a little better but this place wasn't bad.. I'll probably back to try something else from here .. the only negative review I give this place is that when my boyfriend went to use the men's bathroom the lights weren't working.. so he had to wait when we go the theaters to use the bathroom"}
{"text":"Tried this place on the recommendation of my dad. We placed a to go order for the Ham and Gouda, the Grinder, and the Italian Beef. The Ham and Gouda was great and just how you would expect. Cheese was melty and delicious. The grinder was a disappointment because there was only one slice of each type of meat and one slice of cheese on the sandwich. Not much flavor at all there. Italian beef was very standard. 

We came in on a Wednesday evening at 7pm and were the only people there. From ordering to our food being ready it was 25 minutes. Not exactly a quick stop for dinner. I can only imagine how bad the wait is when it's busy."}
{"text":"Stopped in today 10/13/17 with a coworker for lunch. We could not have asked for a more delicious and fresh meal. This spot is right on with a chi-town vibe! We both tried one of their grinders, a ham capocollo and a customized grinder with fresh seasoned grilled chicken, ham, gouda and veggies! Ohh and not to forget some Jays chips! All in all.. Yuuum! I would recommend Scottis to everyone and anyone."}
{"text":"So excited to have this place just a few blocks from my house! Moved here from Chicago two years ago and couldn't find a good hot dog place, back home I could throw a rock and hit 5 different hot dog stands without a problem. Portillos is overrated and never even went there when I lived in Chicago and higly hot dog is decent, but found it odd they diced their tomatoes, which is not done on a Chicago dog. Scotti's did it right! I got a hot dog and a beef. Hot dog was prepared perfectly. The beef I had one issue with, I ordered it wet, now typically when you order it wet they would take the whole beef with tongs and dip the whole sandwich in the juice, like Johny's beef and Als beef, but besides that it was spot on. Will be spending a lot of time and calories there in the future."}
{"text":"Came in here at the suggestion of some coworkers because they had gone earlier in the day and it looked very good. Myself and another coworker dropped in about an hour before they closed and there was only maybe one other person in so we had the place to ourselves. 

We both ordered hot sandwiches, we both ordered an Italian beef and sausage sandwich. Both the sandwiches were delicious aside from the fact that they forgot the sausage on his. My coworker actually ended up ordering a Chicago dog and a cannoli to go. Somehow he ended up with an extra sandwich that he didn't order.

Bottom line, great food. Quiet spot. Knocked off a star for getting two orders wrong when the place was literally empty."}
{"text":"Just WOW. I heard about this place from friends and Facebook, and being born and raised in Schaumburg, IL, I just had to try. First off, the people who work there are EXCELLENT. They make you feel so much at home, and they are just simply genuine. I got to meet Scotti himself. We chatted about about Illinois and was happy to answer any of my questions about the menu.

I ended up ordering the Italian beef with hot and sweet peppers. SO GOOD. The beef was flavorful with just the right amount of moisture, and the peppers completed it. What I was really excited about was having a bag of Jays on the side!!! I didn't even know it was possible to get this in AZ. Their market side has all of your favorites: green river soda, fanny maes, etc. They do a catering thing; so, you can get as many sausages as you want to take home.

Scotti, I am so glad you created this shop. It's so great having all of these Chicago restaurants in the valley, but this is the only place you can get Jays and Gonnella bread.

I will definitely be back, and highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Unexpected great experience... I was across the street dropping off my vehicle to get tires changed and I was handed a menu/flyer by the owner who said to stop by... so I decided to take him up on the offer an hour later. 

A newly opened eatery located at the corner of McClintock & Warner with a Chicago feel offering different types of grinder sandwiches ranging from Roast beef, Italian, Ham and other goodies along with Vienna hotdogs and a small market offering lots of items. 

Looking at the menu I noticed the gourmet grilled cheese, in particular the bacon one but decided to go with the turkey bacon & havarti cheese sandwich which is a hot oven grinder along with chips & drink. All sandwiches are made to order and they are working out the kinks so I didn't mind waiting a few extra minutes. All in all the sandwich was on point. Meal included Jay's Chips (I went with BBQ) and a fountain drink with some carbonation to ensure I got the full experience followed by a good burp! 

I've been to Chicago quite a few times and had family & friends take me out for a \"chi-town\" food experience. I'd say I found a good place for them to try out here in the valley. Looking forward to coming back for a hot dog with all the toppings and that grilled bacon & cheese sandwich. I will definitely try some of the fresh sides they offer in the Market fridge window."}
{"text":"Born and raised in the midwest, I miss the foodie treats there.
I discovered Scotti's on Facebook. 
I was craving a vienna frank and took a lil road trip to Tempe. 

I ordered two...a chili dog and a frank with sauerkraut and mustard; both were good. The toppings were fresh and the poppy seed buns were soft and delicious.
I also bought a big bag of Jay's potato chips, which were a tasty trip back to my childhood when I used to buy .25 bags from the neighborhood ice cream trucks.

I spent a bit more than I thought I would. 2 franks, the chips and a rootbeer totaled  $17."}
{"text":"Stopped by to try it out. The Italian grinder was good tasting and nicely portioned. Chili dogs were good but needs more chili. Don't be fooled by the hot dog atmosphere --order the tamales!! Delicious! Amazing light texture for the masa! Would love to see potato salad or Cole slaw as side alternatives. Can't wait to see what sweet treats they roll out! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Chicago and grew up on Chicago dogs. I was excited to learn that a new place for dogs was right in my neighborhood.  Scotti's has been open about a week. My husband and I stopped in today for lunch. Fast friendly service. But most of all - great Chicago dogs!  Vienna hot dogs. Vienna buns and all the standard trimmings including the celery salt.  They even have ketchup available for those of us that violate the Chicago dog rules and add ketchup!  A couple next to us had the Italian Beef and said it was the best they had in years.  The place also has a small deli.  Grilled cheese is also on the menu - I may just have to try that some day.  We recommend!"}
{"text":"I received a flyer in the mail and the menu looked good so we stopped for dinner.  It's tucked into a strip mall (and behind another building) and I would never notice it if it weren't for the flyer.  Everything looked good and based on their suggestion I went with the hot Rueben on a pretzel bun.  I was skeptical - why would you put a Rueben on a thick pretzel bun??  It was steamed, fresh, moist and not thick.  One word - YUM.  The sandwich was made to order and it was steaming hot.  My husband had the plain grilled cheese.  Yes, YUM again.  Steaming hot, bread was crispy grilled and delicious.  After our meal, we did not feel stuffed, but comfortably fed; in other words, it was not greasy, fatty, nor heavy.  We both took menus for our offices and will definitely be ordering again to try other favorites on the menu."}
{"text":"I just had my first visit to Scotti's and it did not disappoint.  I ordered the hot pastrami and Chicago dog.  Both were amazing.  The pastrami came on a fresh pretzel bun and the pastrami was tender and flavorful.  Scotti and Maria were both very welcoming and definitely make you feel at home.  I would highly recommend to anyone and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The world record for eating grilled cheese is 47 sandwiches in 10 minutes. 

I think I can eat like 50 grilled cheese sandwiches in 10 minutes. Okay maybe not. 

I got the Ham & Gouda and it was excellent. I know I should have gotten something off the \"Chicago Favorites\" part of the menu since it's a Chicago eatery but I eat like a child. I saw grilled cheese on the menu and I wanted it. I don't regret it either.

The Ham and Gouda blew my socks off AND made my skirt flip. It came super fresh and hot and my picture was even distorted by the steam.  I must admit that I'm not usually a fan of ham but this place had me drooling in between each bite.  It was the most perfectly-toasted buttery bread with a slice of Gouda, some ham, a tomato slice, and another slice of Gouda. As I type this, I'm eating my leftovers cold from the fridge and it's still just as delicious. I also tried their German Style Polish dog and it was great --- firm sausage, the right kind of mustard, sauerkraut, and a sharp bite from the onions on a Bavarian pretzel bun. Mmm!

The service here is excellent --- So good that they really do need a bigger tip jar. The guy at the register was friendly, charismatic, and had great recommendations. He even tried to stop me from over-ordering when I said I also wanted a slice of pizza from Rosati's! If I'm not mistaken, when asked if they were owned by the same owner as Rosati's, I think he confirmed it. Please correct me if I'm wrong! Regardless, Scotti's, you won me over.  I'll be back for those Chicago Favorites!"}

They even sell jars of relish and peppers as well as the Rosen buns so I can make my own at home, bonus points.  Saw Okedoke popcorn and had to pick up a bag."}
