{"text":"CLOSED! Liked them for a second, but last time I ate there about a month ago I was almost positive the salad bar gave me food poisining. I had to leave work and became violently ill. No mystery, walked by yesterday and they are shut down. Maybe it was the health department, who knows."}
{"text":"I headed out of Cleveland State University and walked 1.4 miles to C'mon Let's Eat since I had heard of their unique concept of serving home cooked food.
The salad bar was as every other salad bar in the world is, nothing unique there.  After perusing the foods available, such as salmon patties, stuffed peppers, meatballs...I decided to go with a rotisserie chicken $5.99 and a baked potato (which you can load up at the salad bar, then they weigh it and charge you by weight) I had a plain potato with butter only and it was $4.42!!! 
I figured since I had beaten the lunch crowd the food would be fresh!  WRONG!  The chicken was terribly over cooked and dry.  The potato you can't really go wrong with but the butter had a funky taste!  I will not go back since there are so many more new restaurants to try in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"C'mon Let's Eat (CLE - how creative!) just opened a few months back in the space that used to be Quizno's outside 5th street arcade (The last storefront on the Euclid side next to Yum Yums).. It's basically a pre made food shop where you can buy various entrees, side dishes, etc - take it home, heat it, and eat it! They also have a salad bar, which is awesome. 

I've literally had random nights where I've gotten home and have wanted a salad, but haven't had stuff in the apartment to make one and have wandered over, but it's been usually around their closing time - so things have been put away. I FINALLY made it in on my off day yesterday. They had a variety of dishes in the display case - turkey, stuffed peppers, roasted sweet potatoes, seasoned potatoes, turkey loaf, mushroom ravioli, risotto, eggplant parm, deviled eggs, etc. etc. ETC. I talked to the owner and there are different dishes that are prepared fresh throughout the day (When I got there, his wife and just got done making pork loin and hash brown potato pancakes). I decided to get 1/2 lb of the mushroom rav and 1/2 lb of the broccoli and cheese risotto to cover a few meals this week. I also made a huge salad from the salad bar and got some fresh berries which I'll take to work today! I had some of the mushroom rav and risotto last night for dinner and it was DELISH. The mushroom rav was PERFECT... I had to add some hot sauce to the risotto, but it was def tasty on it's own too. I'm glad I discovered this place so close to my apt. 

There are so many nights I want a \"home cooked meal\" - don't want to go get restaurant food- but am too lazy to cook. The things here feel like home cooked dishes, so will definitely do the deed on those nights! They have a dessert case- yesterday they just had a bunch of brownies, but when i've browsed in the past, i've seen pieces of pies as well. They have whole and half rotisserie chickens as well and baked potatoes that you can load up with items at the salad bar.

Speaking of the salad bar- a few items did look like they were drying out (I went around 5pm, so if they didn't get much business yesterday, it probably meant the items just sat there). They said it's been rough opening in the middle of this winter- but are hoping once it gets warm, they will get more business (i hope they do too) - and they plan on being open later than 6pm once it gets warmer!

My ravioli, risotto, salad, fruit, and 2 24 oz bottles of water came out to 14 dollars and some change - I'd say that is TOTALLY reasonable for the amount of food I got!! I anticipate making at least 3-4 meals out of it all so that's amazing :) 

This place is family owned (LOVE!!) and the husband and wife are just SO sweet!! I spent a good amount of time just talking to them when I was in there and they were so friendly. I really hope this business thrives - I love family owned places and am so glad they decided to open this place by my apt (EASY home cooked dinners!)"}
