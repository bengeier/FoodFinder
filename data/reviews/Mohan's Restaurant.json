{"text":"We moved to Plum in 1971.  Went to Mohan's on a regular basis.  Each time we had a baby the staff just doted on our kids and made sure that our baby carrier was put right on the table!  We moved to Ohio in 1975 and never had the chance to go back to the Restaurant... Our loss The food was ALWAYS good, and we miss the friendliness of our hometown.  So glad to see that the restaurant still exists. So many good memories?? Arleen & George Papula, VA"}
{"text":"Great wings. Awesome sandwiches. Friendly staff. Could use some updates to bar for better tv viewing."}
{"text":"1st time here... won't be our last, really good! The fried chicken is way better than any other place I've had on this side of town. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Good, wholesome homemade food. Never let's me down.

BBQ chicken, mashed potatoes w/ gravy, salad, and rolls. The Rueben and the Meatloaf dinner are also solid choices.

I have love for Mohan's food, but your experience really depends on the waitstaff. Some are great, some...well...not so much."}
{"text":"The wings are great, their other food is alright.  Service is consistently atrocious.  There will always be 3-5 people, including your server, sitting around rolling silverware and talking loudly.  It's always a guessing game when they're going to come take your order.  I don't even bother waiting for the check anymore, I just head up to the register to pay and have the hostess get it.  Some of the staff are friendly but most of them make it clear that they don't want to be there.  I only go back because I love the wings but prefer to do take-out now."}
{"text":"Love this place the food is amazing the people awesome prices are great I would.reccomend this to anyone"}
{"text":"Mohan's is a Penn Hills institution!

So it was a Saturday night and I hadn't had a good wing in a while so we decided to try Mohan's again as they have been voted best wings in Penn Hills every year for as long as I can remember. Their menu has all of the usual suspects, burgers, salads, sandwiches, wraps and much more but the undisputed star of the menu has to be the wings! They are whole wings and they are HUGE!

It had been years since we visited so much to our surprise we saw that they have expanded and more than double their space. We were quickly seated and had our drink orders taken.

For our meals my wife went with the four piece fried chicken dinner which came with two sides. She choose a salad and cole slaw. The dinner also comes with a small basket of bread and butter. Our daughter got a burger and fries. No surprise there. 

I of course got the 6 piece wings with spicy ranch dressing on the side. I also got the potato wedges with cheddar and bacon on them. The wedges were delicious and cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. Now when I tell you that the wings were old the chain, they were of the chain. Nice and big with a nice crispy skin and hot and juicy inside. These are by far the best wings in Penn Hills and dare I say the entire eastern suburbs of Pittsburgh! I could only eat two wings and about three wedges as I was stuffed. I was happy to have leftover to enjoy while watching football the next day. 

We will be back often!"}
{"text":"I think this place is been around a long time could use a little updating but the chicken is very good.  I ordered the chicken for a party it was very good but a little on the dry side.  Seems that it is a staple and everybody loves Mohan's chicken for this reason I do give them three stars I would go back"}
{"text":"If you like wings, you must go to Mohan's.  There is no shame in just get 6 becaus ethey are mammoth.  You can get different syles of wings, but the their specialty are the hot wings that are salted, not sauced.  It doesn;t sound great, but believe me it is.  Try these hot mouth watering wings.

Edit:  I had to edit my rating.  The wings have been a little soggy and not as crisp as they use to be."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good here.  Wife had the chicken Tuscan and I had chicken Romano.  Both dishes were very good .Italian dressing for salad  is not the best but side of green beans were excellent.  Beer always cold . Service is pretty lackluster though depending on the waitress you get. Overall a decent experience."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I grew up in Penn Hills and have been going for 30+ years. The last 4 times the service has been horrific. And this hasn't been at busy times. Plus they screwed up running my debit card through charging the wrong amounts causing banking issues and never even apologized. The manager could care less. It's too bad. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Just ate here after a trip to the zoo. I actually want to give it a 3.5 but I always round up. I had the Cajun ranch wings and my wife had the Cajun Chicken Salad. My kids split the chicken planks. I had the New Belgium Citradelic draft beer. Everything was great. Service was good. Wings could have been a little more well done. For me that's the KEY to great wings. If we're ever in the area we will entertain the notion of going back."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and usually a good time. Staff always seems nice and knows what they are doing, always seems busy also...they have cheap drinks and usually specials. I recommend the wings or the provolone(fried).!"}
{"text":"Been there several times, off 'n on.

Good cross section of food... lots to drink... reasonable prices.

Service was good. Extensive beer list... but a fair amount of items are out of stock.

Chicken was very good... even my leftover piece I ate the next day. Potato salad was excellent. Home Fried Potato Chips? That's another story. Basic chips with seasoned salt were extremely salty. (you did see \"extremely salty\" didn't you?)  My wife did not eat her pasta side dish: uneven temperature and overly sweet sauce.

In the past we have enjoyed various sandwiches too.

Worth a visit."}
{"text":"I honestly never heard of Mohan's before and I certainly didn't know what  Universal Chicken meant when I saw it listed on the menu. But after reading the very entertaining background story of its proprietor, Charles A Mohan (Moe) purchasing a former lounge in the Universal Shopping Plaza in 1963 it all came together. 
I am sorry I didn't know about this place sooner because based on my entry into the plaza to park it became apparent that this must be the place to go on a Friday night.  Perhaps even more so during high school football season.
The restaurant was buzzing with patrons left and right and our large party of 20 were escorted to our seating area.
Once seated, we had prompt and friendly service.  Their menu is quite extensive and offers homemade soups, a wide variety of dinner salads, wings, pizza, Italian dishes, seafood and steak entrees, hoagies, wraps, smoked spare ribs and of course various chicken choices.  The pressure-fried is their specialty.  I noticed they even offer a group meal of 1 medium pizza, 10 pieces of chicken, 1 shrimp basket and a pitcher of beer or soda for $32.95.
We were VERY impressed with the speed and accuracy of our orders and service considering the place was quite busy.
The dining room is broken into different sections and there is seating near and at the bar.  The bar features 20 drafts on tap."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Husband and i went last friday for the fish sandwich and it was great!!!! Good beer selection. Best wings in town"}
{"text":"I had a few bad experiences and the Manager was nice enough to reach out to me, so after 6 months, I gave Mohans another shot.  The meals I had on my previous three visits were very good.  

I don't know what the infatuation is with the front booth.  The staff loves to seat me there and it's freezing cold every time the door opens.  The table also has a lean to it.  Not just a small lean, but enough to where I was worried my drink would spill.  

The service has been slow, but o.k.  On my last visit I felt bad asking the older server to get me a refill, so I just went without.  

Today was my last visit, I just can't go here anymore.  Stopped in today and sat at the bar.  Bartender seemed friendly enough and served me immediately.  I was cashing in a few lottery tickets and had an issue with the automated machine.  A very nice woman assisted me and cashed my lottery tickets for me.  I ordered some wings and they took an abnormal amount if time, maybe 25-30 minutes.  Wings take about 12-16 depending on the size.  The bartender checked on me several times, each time calling me \"babe.\"  Ok, this was not a 65 year old woman, but a middle age man.  Maybe gay??  I don't know nor do I care.  But I just don't want to be called babe by anyone other than my girlfriend.  

My wings looked appetizing when they came out.  I pulled the first one apart and I could already tell there was a problem.  I ate one and it was cold and rubbery.  More than likely cooked too long at a low temperature, or in a fryer where the grease was not yet hot enough.  

I cashed out and the bartender asked if something was wrong.  I told him the wings were very gummy.  He still just charged me the full amount and didn't bother to attempt to resolve the issue.  Then as I left he said, \"sorry about that babe.\"  

Sometimes good, sometimes bad.  I will never return."}
{"text":"Good wings, good food. Nice bar for a few relaxing drinks. Not loud or obnoxious. Friendly staff. Sometimes the service is a bit slow."}
{"text":"Good service.  Great selection of beers

The chicken and ribs are definitely recommended

When you come, ask Maryann.  She's the best."}
{"text":"This little place is a Penn Hills gem. They're well known in the community for their fried chicken. I visited recently with my grandma and my daughter, in between lunch and dinner. The waitress (I believe her name was Crystal?) was amazing and had suggestions ready when asked. The food came out quickly and was really good- their barbecue sauce is pretttttttty good.  All of our meals were hot and tasted good, my only gripe- and it's silly and minor- is that the portions are freaking huge. The kids meal had a big adult potion of fries. It's up to you if that's good or bad, just something I noticed. I welcomed the large portions for my green beans though- they really know how to cook 'em. I also really like that this place gives good service without charging an arm and a leg. Or a thigh. Get it? Because their specialty is chicken? And that's a cut of chicken? Oh forget it. I'm a yelper, I'm not funny. 

Anyway, the bottom line is that this is a good family restaurant at a reasonable price. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"4.5 stars here! I would have never known about this place if that Clipper magazine hadn't featured this place on the cover with a free appetizer coupon. I saw the words FRIED CHICKEN and I dragged the hubs here right away. 

Value: A+ You get 2 sides with every entree! It's not clear on the menu what is a premium side so they might want to clarify. Prices are pretty low and portions are big! We left very satisfied.

Taste: Yum! Tried croquettes for the first time and they were so darn delish! It's shaped like a oblong doughnut and stuffed with chicken pot pie filling and dipped in a white gravy that tasted just like KFC's version! I got the famous chicken dinner and it came with 4 pieces of chicken! The batter is very salty but still good. I wish it were crispier though. 

Service: A+ Loved my server, Rachel. She was very genuine and super friendly. Could tell she was a local and enjoyed working here. 

They accept credit cards and there was plenty of parking. The dining area could use some updating and some modern decor but it didn't bother me too much. Will come back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Good wings. We typically order their cajun and garlic parmesan wings."}
