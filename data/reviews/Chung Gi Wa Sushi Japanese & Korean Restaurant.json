{"text":"Outstanding! Freshest sashimi I've ever tasted, great tasting menu and unpretentious quick friendly atmosphere!! This is definitely my fav sushi place right now! My family and I are frequent visitors of this restaurant since the time it's opened and love it very very much. We loved watching their business grow busier over the years, their business is absolutely booming with happy customers on a hourly basis now!"}
{"text":"Sushi here is delicious!
I love coming here as it has perfect characteristics of a restaurant you would find in heaven!  (Especially after getting your hair done at the Spa in the same plaza; the hunger just creeps up on you!!! brrr) 
The staff here are especially friendly, fast.  The food is delicious, fresh.  The decor is clean and elegant.  What else could you ask for?
The tea here is also absolutely amazing! I always ask for extra! :)
Sashimi and Sushi combos are my favourites! I usually come here for celebrations, and special occasions but I think it's about time I come here more often!

EDIT: Their Spicy Salmon Roll was much of a disappointment, basically it's just a salmon roll with bread crumbs spread on top.  I advise you to save the money for this certain dish! :P 
Momiji down at Lakeshore is where it's at if you're an avid fan of Spicy Salmon Roll (like me)! Otherwise everything else should be up to par! :)"}
{"text":"Went to this little place for lunch and the nice lady suggested lunch specials from the menu.
What is not clear from the menu is that the food comes with a bunch of extras that was a nice surprise. We thought it would not be enough but when you add the soup and other appetizers, it was plenty and we didn't even finish it. Loved the service and will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Now this sushi place blew me off of my feet. I used the Yelp app wanting a great sushi place and it was so right on! This place is 4.5 stars and I didn't think twice, I rushed over there with a friend. We got there and found parking with ease. When we walked in, the place seemed small and really quiet. I went to find the washroom which was located at the very back of the restaurant. Man oh man, it looked like a circuit was set up. I had to move around these carts, jump over boxes, squeeze through crates like come on! The funny part was that they were watching me go through all of that and didn't even care to move things around when I came back from the washroom.. Grrr. After all of that, at least the washroom was clean ha! So now we were seated in those secluded booth things, sorry don't know if there's a name for it, but the great thing is that there is a buzzer on the table to get your servers attention. Ok on to the best part! To start I had two miso soup which came with complimentary salad, just delicious! We also were waiting on the missing appetizer of sashimi, that they obviously forgot. Anyway, we ended up getting our ocean, dynamite, and spider roll and it was probably one of best tasting sushi I ever had. The sushi was so good, I did less talking and more eating :) We happened to buzz her and tell her we didn't get the sashimi and since we already have our rolls, she should forget it. We thought she understood but she ended up bringing the sashimi and I was already full and thinking why man!? This is what bugs me with these sushi places and I hate feeling this way but the ones I have gone to so far can't just get it right. It's always the unexpected service that ruins it for me. Let us not forget I had to ninja my way to the bathroom too lol I will still go back for that sushi though :)"}
{"text":"Really good, fresh sushi. Normally we try a few fusion rolls and gam ja tang. The fact we can get both in one place and it's *good* is the reason we go back. The servers will get to know you and how you like your order if you go once or twice a month. I eat here frequently because of how fresh their fish is. Really worth checking out if you like variety and freshness."}
{"text":"My wife and I discovered this place on Tuesday while we were looking for a decent sushi restaurant in the area to satiate our cravings. We were pleasantly surprised to find a Korean run sushi place in Mississauga - I personally love the Korean side dishes that accompany every meal. It was later in the evening and we were the only ones in the restaurant but the server was friendly and seated us in one of the private booths. She sounded like she had lost her voice but she still had a smile on her face and frequently checking on us. Anyways, on to the food...the sushi was great and fish was fresh even though it was late. The glass noodles were nice and warm and the kimchi was really good as well. It was my first time seeing spicy eggplant as a side dish and as a fan of both eggplants and spicy food, I was sold! :) My wife and I were impressed and will definitely be back when we are in Mississauga next time."}
{"text":"So one day when I worked from home, i decided to try this place as its only a 10 minute drive from me.  In short:It's alright, but nothing super special.

-Chirashi lunch special - seemed small compared to other places. Sashimi tasted okay, but it's not as much as I was expecting.  Maybe because it was $10.99, but if I go somewhere else, and pay around $12-$13, there's usually 25% more.  Sashimi wasn't super fresh, but it wasn't terrible either. 

-Banchan - loved the glass noodles and the pickled cucumbers (I think), but no kimchi.  

Service: very friendly

Ambiance - very nice. Loved the little booths.  However the little pillows they use as cushions scare me as they could be filled with germs.

Verdict: not sure if this is the best place for sashimi, but may visit again soon considering it's so close to home. May try some of their Korean dishes and rolls next time."}
{"text":"Really good. Friendly service and fresh food. I'm not a sushi gourmand but everything I've had has been impeccable."}
{"text":"Best sushi/Japanese/Korean restaurant in the area. Have visited numerous times, and always leave stuffed and very satisfied!

Sushi is always fresh and delicious. Sushi chef is friendly, experienced and talented. Every roll I've tried I've loved. 

Many authentic Korean and Japanese dishes on the menu. Salmon teriyaki is a personal fave, and the sushi pizza is the best I've ever had. 

Wait staff are always extremely speedy, helpful, and friendly!

Very reasonably priced - excellent value."}
{"text":"Decent place to eat. I voted 4 stars mainly because the service was great and the waitress was extremely friendly. Side dishes came fast and tasted good. Sushi was not the best I have every had but decent. They also added a scoop of ice cream which I thoroughly enjoyed. 5 stars if they had better quality sushi. The tempura was made well and looked extremely attractive. The place itself was nicely decorated but it was hard to talk because the walls were so thin in the booths that you can hear every word the people next to you were saying."}
{"text":"I went in for some take out, and was instantly welcomed by the unique and delicious scent. The workers are SO polite, and make you wanna come back before you've even gotten your food. I had the pork-bone and potato soup...and even though I'm not Korean, it reminded me of a home cooked meal my mom used to make. Mildly spiced, a calming aura, and a nice comfy taste, instantly making this one of my favorite local Korean spots. Their Korean Pancake is also golden!!"}
{"text":"***NOTE:  This review is for TAKEOUT ONLY and apparently they're under new management as recently as a week ago!***

I recently started coming here, dining in, and decided to do a takeout on Valentine's Day.  I did not want to deal with the restaurant crowds.

I called just before 7pm to give them the order.  A young, Asian male told me that it would take 30-60mins, longer than usual, but seeing how it was VDay, that was fine.  Then he proceeded to ask for my NAME + PHONE #.  I kill the 1/2 an hour, the drive all the way out there - which btw, is not close by any means.

I get to the restaurant, the same guy who took my order starts looking panicked, going through all these Post-Its that are stuck all around the counter.  Not organised.  He then apologises and said that he never took my order.

WHA??  \"Never took my order\"??!!  But you specifically asked me for my NAME + #.  What was that all about? 

Before I left, I ask him to go and ask the chefs to make sure they weren't working on our order.  He comes back and apologises insistently, but fails to do anything about it.  No offer of putting in a new, RUSHED order, no discount on our current, nada.

I left hungry and furious and decided to call to speak to the manager as soon as I got home!  (I could've made a scene at the restaurant, but there were VDay diners enjoying their evening.)  I got the young, Asian guy again who asks me WHY I want to speak to the manager.  I told him he KNOWS why.  He said that neither the manager NOR any of the staff speak English except for him.

I proceeded to tell him that he mishandled the situation, he shouldn't send paying customers away due to his OWN incompetence, what was he going to do for me, etc. and he starts SOBBING.  I told him I didn't want him to keep apologising, I just wanted him to do SOMETHING about his mistake.

Apparently, he's going to leave a note for the manager to comp my meal.  I'm not holding my breath, but I will happily delete this review if they follow through."}
{"text":"A nice Japanese and Korean place located close to Mississauga Chinese Centre. The service was very attentive and friendly. Their sashimi, sushi, Pork Katsu, Soon Tofu stew and Korean side dishes were quite tasty. When I came here just this evening, the previous owners supposedly have left. Although the outside display signs have not been altered yet, the menu now reads as \"Sushi KOKO Asian Fusion Restaurant.\" As you can guess from the name, the business model has changed. Although the new approach seems promising, Chung Gi Wa will be missed!"}
{"text":"This place was a HUGE disappointment. First of all, the waitress taking my order also made my rolls.. There was NO sushi chef????? And the lunch special only included two small rolls - all the other places gave 3 for the same price - and they didn't even include miso soup OR salad. When asked, they simply said \"It's not included in the lunch. You have to pay extra\". The rolls had WAY too much rice and the rice was so soggy!!!!Couldn't taste anything else.. All in all, expensive and horrible service. Will never go back"}
