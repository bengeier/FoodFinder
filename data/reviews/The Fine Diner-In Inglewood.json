{"text":"Food was ok, service was terrible. How about bringing my coffee refill before I'm actually ready to leave. I wonder if the fact that gratuity is automatically included inspires less than average service? The bathroom was quite dirty."}
{"text":"Blueberry pancakes were great but too much for one person. The bacon cheese burger was tasty and fresh. My only comment would be that the server had a bit of an attitude, gave us the bill without asking if we wanted anything else. And it was the wrong bill! Might go back."}
{"text":"Excellent! Eggs bennie was the best with fruit AND hashbrowns. Used open table for reservations and they had a table ready both times which is pretty nice for breakfast meet ups."}
{"text":"I love breakfast, and my gf and perennial brunch mate J. decided we needed somewhere new to eat after our Saturday morning yoga and brunch dates. This is where The Fine Diner came in. I rarely ever trek to Inglewood on a weekend,and solely go there weekdays sometimes at lunch to run. Inglewood is great because it's not as busy as say, Edmonton Trail, and because The Fine Diner a bit further down 9th Avenue it may not be as known to people, hence our wait was 30 seconds before being seated. That's not to say it wasn't busy, it was, but not overly crowded.
It has a simple decor, that won't go out of style in a year, and is bright inside.
We received a lunch menu and a breakfast menu, because The Fine Diner serves breakfast all day.
The menu had enough options, but not too many as to overwhelm and delay my decision making or shut down - too many options, and I just start to stare into my menu and forget where I am.
Anyways, I decided on the Inferno Eggs Benny, and my gf the Duck Eggs benny.
My eggs were paoched and had a light sauce that was spicy, and came on cornbread. It was served with fruit - realy fruit:grapefruit, kiwi, orange - and a side of fresh hasbrowns that weren't too salty. My gf's duck eggs benny were served on a slightly sweet bread, which we couldn't identify and the duck was cooked perfectly.
What we both appreciated was the size of the portions, which is small.
This isn't a plce that would cater to people with large appetites in my opinion, or who like to stuff themslves full, unless they want to spend a lot. Sides come at an extra cost. e paid $14 and $15 each for our benny's, which for the portion size I'm used to is expensive, however it's quality food, and I was happy with it all.
They serve Phil & Sebastian coffee, which was great as usual.
The server was excellent, attentive, and very kind. Maybe an owner? He always refilled our water, asked if we had questions, and even made some great suggestions. He asked if we could thank the kitchen because I mentioned how much I liked the food, and I thought that this was thoughtful of him, as he said they never get enough compliments in the kitchen directly themselves.
I'll be going back each time I find myself in Inglewood to try the rest of their menu items."}
{"text":"The food was really good. The ambiance is very nice.  The kitchen certainly knows what they're doing, and they do it with obvious love. The eggs benny florentine were cooked to perfection, and the orange yolked eggs were really delicious (I've never seen those before!).  The pancakes were enormous and so good.  The meatball sandwich, not spicy at all, although that's how it was labeled, is tasty.  The reason I've taken one star off is because of our server.  He was anything but friendly, and actually detracted from our experience (significantly).  We kept wishing one of the others would take over our table, because they were a lot friendlier, far more animated and seemed to care that they had guests. If we return we'll be certain to make sure we request another server so that we can truly enjoy every element of our meal.  Not just the food."}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent. I got the eggs Florentine Benedict ... I couldn't really taste the Hollandaise sauce Cause there was barely any on there. 

Service was pretty slow due to there only being 1 server. Only was asked for a refill on coffee near the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Service isn't that great. Server seemed to be the owner and didn't seem happy or friendly when asked about the menu."}
{"text":"The Fine Diner was featured on the Food Network's \"You Gotta Eat Here!\" - Season 3, Episode 16 that was aired on July 4th, 2014.

The Fine Diner is a refreshing new school diner that is located in old school Inglewood.

After reading great reviews and seeing it on You Gotta Eat Here! My girlfriend and I decided to check the place out. Getting to The Fine Diner was really simple and parking was easy to find but then things started to go down hill from there. 

We went at 6:45pm on a beautiful sunny Saturday afternoon. We were greeted right away and was seated, our hostess/server gave us the menu and ask if we wanted to drink. After coming back with water we told her we just need a few minutes since it was our first time. We figured out what we wanted but the hostess/server was no where to be found so we waited, 15 minutes later the hostess/server came back and took our order then took other customers orders as well. We were patiently waiting and talking then to our surprise we saw a group of unhappy customers walked out and thought \"wow is it going to be slow?\" 15 minutes gone by and we didn't receive our food. We looked at each other and said that we'll give them a chance. 10 minutes went by and still nothing not even an update from the hostess/server on the delay. At 7:28pm we decided to walk out if the food didn't come at 7:30 but then the food starting coming out, first our table then the next two and surprisingly the other group also waited nearly half an hour for their order. The hostess/server didn't apologize for the delay, she just placed our food then left the dining floor. 

My girlfriend ordered the Bistro Chicken and I ordered the Pomegranate Duck. The plating was great so we dug in to try the first few bites. We both agreed that our dish was really salty. Her chicken wasn't marinated or sauced and was completely dry, the fries on the other hand was really salty. My duck was seasoned to perfection but the Brussel Sprouts were kind of burnt and too crispy, even my roasted potatoes was really salty. It was really hard to finish our dish without constantly asking for water to wash down the salt. From the looks of it they didn't use the basic standard salt but sea salt instead and there was lots of it. We would send it back but we're not going to wait another 30 minutes just for them to fix the mistake.

When the hostess/server collected our plates she asked if we either want dessert or the bill. Talk about being pushy. We already had a bad experience we don't need a pushy server to make it worst. We paid the bill but didn't tip and went on our way. Sorry I'm not tipping if my experience was bad.

We were really disappointed with our experience. Even though The Fine Diner was featured on national television I believe they should offer the same service even if they're not on camera. 

Unfortunately this review lost 3 stars because of lack of efficient service, not updating about the delay, and the food was very salty. This review would have lost another star if we walked out but we did end up getting our food after nearly half an hour.

Would I recommend The Fine Diner? No. Would I visit the restaurant in the near future? No, not unless we don't have to wait 15 minutes to get our order and another 30 minutes to get our food."}
{"text":"my first visit here was for Canada day brunch. i was expecting to wait to be seated. I did not expect free coffee while I waited. It just got better from there. Every bit of my salmon Benny was delicious. The tea was wonderful. I loved the personality of my waitress. When I mistook my knife for a trebuchet I had a replacement at my side before I'd finished retrieving it. And this was mid-morning on a sunny holiday Sunday. All brunches henceforth have to face the fine diner as my new benchmark."}
{"text":"We were excited about breakfast this morning and going, the Fine Diner was my choice after seeing it on TV.  I think customer service is paramount and the Fine Diner Waitress had none.  The restaurant was empty except for two other customers it was around 11 am. 
We asked  for  a table for three and she wants us to sit right next to the customer already seated.  I asked if we could sit at another location and she said no.  The only table we could sit at was the one for three.  Really think she should rethink her career.

The food was good."}
{"text":"I heard so much about this place from various friends that I ventured down to Inglewood at lunchtime today to give it a try.   Normally I don't right reviews but felt compelled as I felt the server really did an injustice to my visit.  I ordered the 3 egg breakfast and my friend order the steak and eggs meal.  Food was so so and I would be willing to give something else on the menu another try but Dear God I want another waitress.  We signed several times to have coffee refilled and to get a glass of water she  ignored us.  Not once did she come along and ask if there was anything we needed.  She didn't ask if we wanted dessert.  My friend was set on the regular spot of going to Phil's and I raved about this nice spot in Inglewood and now I regret it.   What a shame!!"}
{"text":"Drove past many times, finally decided to try it. The atmosphere is great, the food is amazing! Seriously, try the breakfast burger!Just undecided on the service"}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes for bland macaroni and cheese, and my coffee wasn't refilled once.  I've heard from others that the problem with this place is the food and service are so hit and miss.  I don't know if we'll go back."}
{"text":"Overpriced and portions are small especially relative to other places in the city that will give you a full breakfast. Almost cost $25 for a basic eggs Benedict . I was hungry when I left. Do not recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place and its usually our breakfast choice on the weekend. We get there early before the crowd so never have had to wait but if you do there's chairs and coffee while you wait.
The quality of the food is excellent and at a very reasonable price. Dh loves their homemade bacon, says its the best he's tasted and we travel a lot.  Have not tried their lunch or dinner menus yet but it's on our to do list.
Love their main waitress she's fabulous, attentive and chatty just like it should be in a diner. Overall this is a great addition to Inglewood."}
{"text":"I was walking through Inglewood looking for a place to eat lunch and randomly chose The Fine Diner-In Inglewood, and I am glad I did.  The restaurant is a quaint place.  I ordered the Roasted Squash Duck Confit Salad which was superb.  The waiter said it had just recently been added to the menu.  The rest of the menu appeared to have some other fine choices.  A chalkboard indicated that they served modern comfort food which based on my lone experience I would agree."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of most breakfast foods, so it takes a lot for me to really love breakfast at a restaurant. My sister suggested Fine Diner and I was excited to try it out because they have a large selection of lunch type foods on the menu. Unfortunately, we went at 9 am and our server told us the lunch menu isn't available until 11 am. (I couldn't find this mentioned on the menu or online...)

The cons: coffee was bitter, hollandaise sauce on my benny was too thick, my sister's benny had barely any hollandaise sauce, potatoes were bland, I had to peel the skin off of my kiwis, and the server wouldn't let us move to a booth that had opened up. (Wow, now that I type all of that out, I'm kind of a complainer!)

The pros: the bacon is great, and the caramelized bananas that come with the banana bread french toast are yummy. 

Considering the other breakfast options in the city, I probably won't go back to Fine Diner for breakfast. I would still like to try out some of the lunch options."}
{"text":"I had my first and last experience here today. The wait staff were awful. We showed up 10 minutes early for our reservation and as such, the hostess actually kicked out another table. It was appalling. Our waiter snapped and one our guests when she asked if her bacon could be crispy, She was told there is only one way to cook it and to deal with it. We were not asked if we wanted any beverages until we were ready to order our meals. They \"will not serve you until you close your menu\". The same waiter was serving the table next to us and told told the gentleman who was still deciding what to have \"last chance, what do you want\". 

The food is overly priced and mediocre at best. The wait staff have a superiority complex and think they are on a Seinfeld Soup Nazi episode. I will never return to this establishment nor recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a Saturday brunch.  A good atmosphere and friendly staff, including the owner taking orders.  We had a vegetarian benny and frittata, Both were very good.  Highlights include the excellent medley of veggies used in the home fries (beets, etc) and the generous side of fruit.  Like most brunch places in Calgary, the non-meat options could be improved (we used to live in Vancouver - much more interesting options).  Also, the hollandaise sauce on the benny could be more piquant- it was quite creamy and should have a sharper edge.  We'll definitely come back when we are in Inglewood again."}
{"text":"I love a good brunch and had been looking forward to trying this new(ish) restaurant in Inglewood.  We arrived around 1:15 and saw they closed at two.  We were informed that the wait would be about an hour but they would still be happy to seat us.  I appreciate their willingness to do so after their posted hours.  While we waited I filled up on complimentary coffee and browsed some nearby shops.  I wasn't too impressed with their selection of savoury vegetarian breakfasts (some kind of vegetable scramble or huevos rancheros-esque dish would be good) so I just had the classic breakfast with scrambled eggs, hash browns and extra fruit in place of bacon.  Everything was okay.  I opted to indulge in a smore milkshake to drink, and sadly I found it quite lacking in flavor.  Service was a bit oddly-paced, sometimes rushed and sometimes slow, and at the time we happened to visit the sun was hitting the windowside tables in a really uncomfortable manner.  I might consider returning to the Fine Diner, but there are much better brunch spots out there in YYC."}
{"text":"I live in the area and want to love this place.  But it is hard with such over-priced food.  The quality is usually okay (usually), but for the price I will go elsewhere.  My most recent disappointment was their wild mushroom frittata for $16.  Generous with the mushrooms although I suspect they were rehydrated as they were quite chewy.   I assumed it came with toast or potatoes.  It did not.  I also assumed it would be big enough to feel full after.  It was not.  So add on another $2 for toast and we are up to $18.  Top it off with the $3 soda and I was paying $21 for breakfast.  Plus tax.  Plus tip.  Perhaps others think that is a reasonable price to pay, but I don't."}
{"text":"The guy who greeted us was nice but the waiting room (oddly the same size as the dining room) the coffee was cold and when another waiting guest asked the waitress she totally brushed him off. She seemed rather rude. We elected to leave."}
{"text":"What an excellent meal. Have tried the frittata and bennies and both are wonderful. Great local ingredients, house cured bacon, fresh fruit, duck fat hash etc...

One of my favourite breakfast spots in town now!"}
{"text":"Overall, our experience here was very good. The service was not as unpleasant as we had feared, given the other reviews. We ordered the pineapple chicken burger, the banana bread French toast, and the Alberta eggs Benedict. The chicken burger was quite good, as was the banana bread, but the banana bread was gluten-free which made for a slightly off-putting texture, but the taste was good. This restaurant is very clean, which is always quite welcome."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here for a later lunch on a Friday.  I was really happy with our selections - I had the brie/pear grilled sandwich which came with a wonderful fresh salad.  He had the eggs benny and scarfed it down really fast so I know he loved his choice too.  Definitely we'll go back.  And we had no problem finding parking in the area."}
{"text":"Food here is ok. The pancakes are more like a cake instead of a regular pancakes. Not particulary terrible just not what I had expected. Also the service is very hit and miss. The older gentleman who is assume is the owner was very uninterested in awnsering our questions about the menu and was blaitantly rude. Even the table beside us commented how rude he was to us."}
{"text":"These guys have some seriously delicious breakfasts. The croque madame and pulled duck hash are excellent. If Super Seth makes a recommendation, listen to him - he knows what he's talking about."}
{"text":"The Fine Diner is a delightful bistro in Inglewood with an upscale breakfast/brunch dining experience. I haven't been there for dinner yet. The bacon is truly to die for, which just melts in your mouth and has the most amazing flavor. Eating gluten free is often a challenge, but not here. I'm in love with the gluten free blueberry pancakes.  The potato hash is cooked to perfection with just the right amount of seasoning, the best I've tasted. The new owner Stephen, has done a wonderful job on the menu. It's difficult to choose what to try next. I'm obsessed with coming here at least once a week for breakfast!  You'll be sure to make it your \"regular\" place as well."}
{"text":"I was planning to go to another place in Inglewood, but it was gone, so went into the Fine Diner because it was open and I liked the name. We both went for the DLT (duck, lettuce, tomato) sandwich mainly because the number of duck dishes indicated that must be a specialty there. I chose the grilled veggies and my friend went for the salad as a side. The duck was tender and delicious (even cold the next day) and comes on a very nice baguette with the lettuce and tomato and a light dressing. It's served rare, which my friend didn't care for, but the kitchen obliged her by cooking it a bit longer. Sides were both good, fresh. I was a little cautious ordering the grilled veggies as these sometimes consist mainly of charred bell peppers. However these were a nice assortment of broccoli, carrots and just a few peppers, all nicely done.
The service was quite slow, but that may have been due to a very large party at one of the tables. They were pretty quick about dealing with the rare duck though. All in all a nice meal. I would like to go back and try their breakfasts."}
{"text":"Last Friday I decided to give my cousin a call to see if he wanted to grab lunch since we both have Fridays off. He lives right by Inglewood so I thought I could use that as an excuse to finally give this place a try! Luckily his fiance decided to take the day off and she liked the idea too. So off we went. 

The decor of the place is fantastic. I'd say it's retro but with a nice modern feel to it. The giant mirror on one side almost tricked me into thinking the place was bigger than it actually is! We sat down and our waitress was a very friendly woman who made us laugh several times over the course of our stay.  Later on the bill it said we were served by Mama Bear, which gave us another chuckle. 

The food was presented really well, and the fries(delicious!) came in their own little deep fry basket. I had the California Chicken sandwich, which was really good except the guacamole was coming through the bread a bit. :(   My cousin had the stuffed french toast, which looked like Angel food cake to me. I was expecting something a little heavier and less fluffy. The Salmon eggs benedict ordered by his fiance may have been the best out of the three meals. 

I think I'll give this place one more go to see if they can wow me."}
{"text":"Well the food was good but here is the problem: I ordered a beef burger and my husband ordered a lamb burger. They put his lamb burger in my bun and vice versa. When I pointed it out to the chef (who by the way had stopped by our table to ask about the food, I was not going to complain), I was told that because the fixins' on my husband's burger were congruent with the lamb burger, that his burger was indeed the lamb burger and that there had been no mistake. Well I don't like lamb and I do like beef and I know that I was given a lamb burger with the fixins of the beef burger. I did not eat the lamb burger. Why didn't I just switch patties with my husband's burger, you might ask? Well his fixins included goat cheese and I don't like goat cheese. When the staff asked about my uneaten burger, I mentioned that it was indeed lamb and I invited the chef to smell the burger. Alas! No chef appeared. I guess it was more important for him to believe he was right than to satisfy a customer."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed everything about this place. The food was excellent. At first glance, it seems a bit pricey, but they use lots of local ingredients, and pay they staff a living wage, so all tips go to charity. Staff were lovely. I really appreciate their progressive approach."}
{"text":"Fine diner...you live up to your name.

We had a family brunch here on a Sunday for our resident' child's 11th birthday. Even though it was horrible weather out and we arrived at 9:30, the place was packed. We all managed to cram around a 4 person table (5 adults and the kid).

The server told us from the get go they were short staffed. Hey, it happens, especially in weird weather. I appreciate they tried to manage our expectations from the start that service might be a bit slow. She was on her own as a server and wow -  was she hustling!! We did have periods where the wait was a little longer than normal but she was friendly and attentive when she could be and was clearly going at max speed. I've had worse service in over staffed restaurants. Props to her.

I had the Bacon Bennie. It was SO good. The house cured bacon was cooked perfectly. The eggs were great too, although they weren't exactly poached to medium as promised. But whatever, they tasted great. The hollandaise was tangy and had a pretty spicy kick to it which I loved. However if you are a \"purest\" it might take you off guard. The benny was served with a huge portion of fresh fruit and tasty homefries. I ate every bite!

The man had steak and eggs and he enjoyed it. The steak was a decent size and thickness, unlike the thin little steaks you sometimes get at breakfast places. The child had pancakes....I swear they were an inch thick and there were three of them! He made it through about half. He also had a cookies and cream milkshake on the advice/insistence of the server who told him that on your birthday, you need to indulge.

My sister in law had the banana bread french toast. I'm not a huge fan of either but it smelled so good I wanted to steal hers. Grandpa had traditional bacon and eggs and he liked everything as well.

Six of us ate for about $100 (not including tip) which is on par if not better than most breakfast places in the city, with much better quality than most. The service was great despite their challenges and they managed to keep our coffees full. What more could you want on a snowy Sunday morning?"}
{"text":"The restaurant is in a great neighbourhood with good parking and has a modern feel.  Their menu is average with the classic breakfast choices. Services was okay.  The down side was the prices. I am loving the Diner trend in Calgary but not all diner food is created equal.  The Fine Diner charges upscale prices but serves low quality food.  I paid $18 for a lobster frittata that had 5 small pieces of lobster in it (I counted) and was dry and overcooked.  I am more than happy to pay these prices when the food is local &/or organic and well prepared but this Diner seemed to want to charge the high price without serving the high quality."}
{"text":"It's Fine. That's about it. There are so many diner choices in Calgary now that I can't rate this above 2 stars. Wait is long, but I guess that's par for the course. Service was ok. The burger was disappointingly full of filler - ended up mushy in texture. The bacon mac&cheese uses their house cured, somewhat glazed? bacon, so it was sweet. Weird taste combo in a mac & cheese."}
{"text":"Very cozy and small, The hash browns and eggs were very delicious except the bacon was cloyingly sweet with a maple syrup aftertaste that's way too strong."}
{"text":"I just want to start off by saying the food is always good, but wow is the service terrible. I've been here many times but continue to get repeated bad service. Hadn't been here in about 3 months because the service was so bad last time I was in. Thought we'd give it another chance because I was craving the banana bread French toast. This will unfortunately be the last time we come. I'm not going to summarize every part of how bad it was but this should sum it up. We both ordered coffee and water, comes back to refill coffee after we'd been out for 10 min. Asked for water again. Ate all our food and ready to pay. They clear our plates and we finally get water.... so disappointed..."}
{"text":"Had been to the Fine Diner before and had a great experience. This time (a few months later)the complete opposite. The waitress was very rude, food was not as ordered and not very tasty. I was really looking forward to a nice lunch and came away thinking that I won't be back. Not sure if they have new management but they seem to be less than adequate."}
{"text":"This is a shaky three stars as my food went back but my partner had a great experience food wise.  He ordered the breakfast burger, fries and a chocolate shake and he loved it.  I ordered a bacon benny after hearing the waiter rave about their in house cured bacon.  Yah - gross.  The bacon was 3/4 fat and the 1/4 of bacon meat was funny tasting.  One egg was hard poached, the other soft and potatoes were cold.  The teaspoon of hollandaise on each egg was tasty but was woefully skimpy.  The waiter offered to re-make the plate or order something else but by that time my partner was almost done so I passed on trying something else.  It is a definite hit and miss and even our waiter commented that at least 50% of the table worked.  

Also...just starting to notice this Calgary...how about a little breaky/brunch space at my table?  This isn't Paris.  Once again we were almost sitting on top of the couple next to us and being forced to listen to their conversation.  One less deuce means a better experience - even if I do have to wait."}
{"text":"The Diner is quite cute inside. Fairly spacious but quaint. 

Whoever hired Mardi, the sassy waitress had a stroke of pure genius as she made everyone laugh and feel welcome. I don't know who she was or where she came from...or...if she even works there?...LOL....Her personality is what made our visit a plus. 

It was a fun visit even if there were a few mistakes with our order but we'll probably revisit soon and try more menu items."}
{"text":"Good food! Second time here. Pulled Pork Hash is not your typical hash, but It's delicious anyways; purple potatoes are always welcome! Also, the Vanilla Custard French Toast is absolutely delicious. The coffee is very nice too. The restaurant is small, with no waiting area, and can be awkward to check in. But once you're in, it's very comfortable. I recommend this Inglewood gem."}
{"text":"Ugh. I'm so sad to write this, because I really wanted to love this restaurant. My cousin and I stopped in for breakfast on a Sunday morning, and it's beautiful inside. It's set up very nicely with lots of natural light and everything feels very new. We were seated promptly and the staff was very attentive. When we received our breakfasts, they looked GREAT... and then all the good ended. I cut into one of my eggs and pale yellow yolk spilled out. For the non-foodies that may be reading (ha! who am I kidding? Yelp is only foodies!), the color of an egg yolk is the main indicator of quality of the egg and the health of the hen. Healthy hens will lay eggs with dark orange yolks, where as less well cared for hens lay eggs with pale yellow yolks. Dark yolk eggs are both more flavorful and more nutritious, thus my disappointment that Fine Diner was serving low quality eggs. The bacon at Fine Diner is house made, but I wasn't a fan. I normally love thick bacon, but this was sweet not savory and more like ribs. I like ribs, just not when I'm expecting bacon. Finally, the hashbrows were also lacking flavour, just not enough seasoning. Overall my meal was so bland, it was practically tasteless. This was so sad because presentation was beautiful, but the only part with any flavour was the fruit =("}
{"text":"I like Fine Diner, I do, but I have to give them a not great rating. I've been there 3 times. My food has been really good twice but my husband's has been wrong twice. Twice he has ordered eggs benny with the eggs cooked medium (which means runny yolk) and they've come out hard. He is an egg stickler so not good. Also, they cure there own bacon (I think) and it is cut quite thick. Yay on thick cut but that means you have to cook it longer. Often when you get bacon at Fine Diner, it is barely warm. That's not bacon, people!

Overall, I like the place and I will return but I don't think it quite lives up to the hype or to the waiter's assertion that they have the \"best chef in Calgary\". If you are going to say that you better make darn sure you cook eggs properly!

Just to clarify...I hate the doneness words for eggs b/c they are so subjective. We told the waiter that we were looking for cooked white but yolk with a runny center. He said \"Oh, okay...medium\". One came out perfectly & one was hard (like hard boiled)."}
{"text":"Staff are very friendly, food was excellent and coffee is probably the best in Calgary. I have dined at this restaurant three times in four weeks, on each occasion the food and service were splendid. Especially enjoy the creative way they are able to give an old staple a new twist. Oh and don't miss one of their in house dessert creations!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to The Fine Diner I was blown away by their blueberry pancakes! They were fluffy and sweet and tasted like cake! I was so in love with them that I was excited to go back but was very disappointed when I did. The pancakes were flat and had no flavor to them. It tasted as if someone had forgotten to add the sugar and vanilla. My boyfriend order the Salmon Eggs Benedict and said they were soggy, salty and an egg was broken before it arrived at our table. We were also seated in the back room which looked more like a storage area than anything. The large bill at the end for two breakfasts was very high for the quality that we received. We were very disappointed overall with The Fine Diner and will not go back."}
{"text":"We have anxiously been awaiting the opening of The Fine Diner. Always having a new place to wander to in Inglewood.

We went for a Friday lunch, arriving right at noon. The place was hopping, with tables half full, a few reserved and just a couple left to fill. We managed to scoop one of the last ones. The place is not terribly big, so if you WANT to go, call ahead & make a reservation. It was packed by the time our drinks arrived.

The menu is varied. Lots of diner standards, with modern twists plus some less typical diner fare. We opted to start with fried pickles - YUM! Coating was good and crispy, but not greasy. If you like pickles, definitely give it a try. We also had a Diner burger. Tasty! Just the right size too. Lots of garlic aioli & the pancetta was a nice touch. Bonus points for having a flavourful burger that does not drip all over you - important when having to return to work. Someone at the table next to us got the fish tacos. They looked fantastic and fresh. Definitely want to give them a try sometime.

Service was friendly! Funny even. :) The one downside is that we waited a looooooong time for our bill. However it was crowded with lots of people calling for attention. I imagine it's difficult to know how to staff a restaurant in the first few weeks, so will cut them a break on this one.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my family. Order what the waitress recommend. (Chicken an the surf n turf Mac n cheese) can't say I ate anything great but it wasn't bad. To top off it seems that they where sold out of half there stuff. But at 6:49 there was only 4 tables in there. I do want to come back for breakfast cuz it seemed to me more of a breakfast place then for dinner. Will try again but at this point I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"So what do you do when you can't find the restaurant you were looking for? Well, if you're in Inglewood just drive another couple of blocks and you'll surely run across the Fine Diner like we did! 

My BFF and I wanted an awesome breakfast with some gluten-free options and...WOW, the choices were amazing. I ordered the Pulled Duck Hash, and she ordered the Gluten-Free Banana Bread French Toast. We couldn't pass up the in-house smoked bacon, and I suggest that you don't either because it was stellar! 

The Duck Hash was...well, it left me speechless for about five minutes. My poached eggs were absolutely perfect and the hollandaise wasn't too heavy. The pulled duck was soooo dreamy.......sorry, drifted off into Pulled Duck Hash land there! 

The Banana Bread French Toast did not disappoint either. The portion was huge, and the fresh bananas, strawberries and whipped cream were a nice touch as the banana bread was very dense and rich. So delicious! 

The. Bacon. THE BACON. I don't think any other bacon will ever do in comparison now. Thick-cut, caramelized, cooked to perfection. I can say that this is some of the best bacon on the planet.

I have to give some extra thumbs-up for the service as well. They were busy, but we were well cared for the whole time we were there. Don't pass up an opportunity to eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The second time my daughter was served an undercooked burger. She ended up getting sick from it. I checked their inspection reports... ewwwww. I will never go back here. I wouldn't recommend anyone go. It's too bad, the restaurant is cute and the staff were amazing."}
{"text":"Four of us went to the Fine Diner yesterday ( Good Friday ) and waited one hour to get in. The waitress we had was anything but friendly. She was curt about not having decaf coffee, splitting the bill for the two couples and taking our orders. Usually they take the women first, but she said, \" I will go this way,\" and took the men first.
As far as the bacon, eggs, hash browns and toast goes for $ 12. 00, you get better value at Ricky's for the same thing and the bacon and toast aren't hard. They also have decaf coffee too. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. The staff are fun and personable. The food is delicious and the ambience is great. Cozy on a winter's day. Gourmet!"}
{"text":"Food:  Good but nothing special.  My cured salmon was a bit fishy.

Quality:  OK.

# diners:  2

Prices:  A bit high compared to other breakfast places like Dairy Lane, Red's or Blue Star

Service:  AWFUL & UNPROFESSIONAL.  Felt like a truck stop instead of a \"FINE\" diner.

The waitress was inattentive and unfriendly.  In fact, right after we finished our meal and asked for more coffee, she told us we should leave soon because there was a line up....I found this very unprofessional even though I understand their need for faster turnover.  However, this is their business and they need to foster much better customer loyalty.

So we put our money on the table with the bill and she NEVER came back to get it.  Nobody asked if we needed any change.  Instead, the hostess came by and actually asked us to leave because of their wait list.  

In total we were there for less than 2 hours. They made us feel like we were a nuisance and not valued at all.   

With so many great diners such as Diner Deluxe (Aspen and Edmonton Tr), Red's (Beltline and Ramsay), Dairy Lane, Blue Star, Monki, Holy Grail and The Loop, I won't be going back here soon.  And if I did, I would first check to see if the same waitress was working!"}
{"text":"This breaks my heart but I have to let Fine Diner go.  Went there a few months ago and had a great lunch.  Went there yesterday and it was a total disaster.  I ordered the fried chicken poutine and it was awful.  For $18 I got burnt chicken (like black) and the fries were cold.  Not cool, but actually COLD.  So cold the cheese curds didn't even melt.  When I raised the problems with the server she half-heartedly asked me what I wanted her to do.  Seriously?  Shouldn't the response be \"I'm so sorry.  I will get you a new order up immediately.\"  So I say, \"I would like hot fries, I really cannot eat this\".  In the end I get hot fries but my lunch date is now finished eating.  Gee that was a great experience. When the bill comes the server says she took 10% off.  Wow.  What a gesture.  Why even bother.  Sorry Fine Diner but you can't charge top notch prices and provide hit and miss food and lousy service to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I have had two excellent experiences.. Once during burger week (amazing!), and once for a lunchtime salad (top notch!).  Last weekend 3 of us stopped at around 11am.  Smarmy waiter, long, long wait due to a forgotten order and mediocre food.  I'll probably try it again, but my expectations are not great."}
{"text":"The first time I had been here, over a year ago, I thought it was okay. But now I've really gotten to like it.

The menu is comfort food, comfort food, comfort food! All in a super cute, cozy, modern-looking diner. The waiters and waitresses are all super cute, friendly and give off the \"I am 30 years older than you, honey, so trust me I've seen life\" vibe.

Their chef Rob Greco is just an awesome dude. Those are the only words to describe him. Funny, quirky, bearded, and genuine - and as much as this man tries to stay low-key, he ends up on Shaw TV, Food Network, etc etc - because well, his food is that good.

Their Texan Diner burger for YYC Burger Week was excellent. Huge patty, thick cut bacon, avocado, nacho slivers, and jalapenos galore! Grab a napkin and a glass of water because your nose will be running, while eating this flavourbomb!

Their drinks are reasonably priced too, and their desserts are homey, cozy and tasty. And VERY generously portioned!

Nothing flashy or show-offy about this place. Just a great modern-style cozy diner with tasty comfort food. Yum."}
{"text":"Traditional eggs Bennie 4/5 yelps they were good. 
Service 4/5 yelps we were the only table at 7:30am but it took a bit of time for the food to be served.
Value 2/5 yelps +$20 for eggs Bennie is not worth it.
I thought Reds in Ramsey the day before was expensive($17). 
I don't understand how eggs and toast is so expensive."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant overall - it definitely seems to have improved over the past couple months with a change in ownership. The food is fantastic as always (definitely a place for foodies), and the prices are quite reasonable."}
{"text":"YuM! I just had the Duck Benny for lunch and it was TASTY! The egg was perfectly cooked and simpy delicious (I think they use organic/free range eggs...). The bread was like freshly baked biscuit and the duck was perfectly cooked. A+ on the benny. The side of potatoes was ok... I ended up leaving them and eating my friend's crispy potatoey seasoned fries.

I didn't try a milkshake but i've heard from two other people they're to die for! Flavours like blueberry vanilla, s'mores, and Kahlua (for adults only)"}
{"text":"Went for lunch last week and love the fact that I should still get breakfast! That really is something that is hard to find. Cute space , and there were a couple of other tables in there, can see how it would be a little crowded when they are full. I had the lobster eggs benny, which had a small tempura fried lobster piece on the top which was delicious and not quite the way I was expecting. Sauce was good and not too rich, nor did it taste out a packet, muffin was crisp toasted which meant it didn't get too soggy by the time I was finished eating and that was a nice change. Would have liked there to be more lobster though. This dish is $18 and could use some a bunch more lobster to justify the price point. My mom had their special which was maple pancakes with pork. When the dish arrived we both commented that 2 waffles was too much food - but they are done lovely and thin so are crisp and delicious, with me helping her we almost finished it all. Her pork was delicious and soft with great flavour. Between the 2 hers was best for sure. 
All in all would give the diner a second try and go for the croque madam, as saw another table having it and just love some melted cheese! Little over priced for what it is and hope that over time their prices average out with over restaurants. 

Like that they have half price wine on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"I wish I could've liked The Fine Diner better, I really do. Service is friendly here. 

But that's really all I can rate them for, because there wasn't much for me to eat. 

And what was there, I almost couldn't eat, because the ingredient I asked to be left out of the salad, was piled on top of it. I took one look at it, and saw grapefruit all over my salad.

\"No, there's no grapefruit on there.\"

Strike. I know I asked you to ask the kitchen not to put grapefruit on there, and you took their word for it rather than checking for me before you brought it out. But, I can see it plain as day, and you're arguing with me. You won't even take it back until two other people at the table tell you, yes it is in fact, all over the top of the salad.

And as I discovered later, midway through the salad; GRAPEFRUIT ALL UP ONS.

Thankfully, I only asked for it to be without the grapefruit because it conflicts with my medication and could exacerbate the side effects. Because that already sounds like a barrel of fun.

What if I had a grapefruit allergy? It took 30 minutes for the salad to come out, and less than 2 minutes after I sent it back, it was in front of me again. I initially assumed that it had taken so long before, because they wanted to serve me with everyone else (because seriously, how long does it take to put together a new salad, unless you are harvesting it from the Earth) - but nope, someone just spooned it off the top. 

So yeah, she was friendly otherwise, and I know the arguing was more absentminded than intentional - but I have zero faith in the kitchen. The two stars is more for how well everyone else was treated. And the inexpensive drinks. Yay."}
{"text":"i was recommended to come here, but I was very disappointed by the service, food, and the environment. The 4 of us each ordered something different, the burger was decent, the mushroom frittata was not bad either, but my steak hash was problematic. I ordered the steak medium rare, but it came out very well done, and it was very hard to cut without a steak knife. The waiter didn't offer an apology but just said that he asked for a medium rare and would get me another one. The poached egg covered in hollandaise sauce and home fries on the plate were pretty good, but the flavor was too heavy without the steak, as the steak was sandwiched in between them. 

We waited for about 20 minutes before the waiter came back and took away all of our plates, including mine, and instead of the whole entree, he just gave me a steak on a small plate without any sauce or anything. The steak was done right and tasted great, but the service was mediocre at best, especially when I couldn't finish the egg and fries in the original plate without the steak to offset the flavors. Meanwhile, we had some very loud neighbors who were talking at the top of their lungs, and the waiter didn't do much about it after we mentioned this to him. 

When the bill came, we couldn't get separate bills because \"the system isn't set up that way\", and I was charged full price for the entree that came out wrong the first time and was only offered partial entree in the second attempt. These small things really added up for me and I simply would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. The veggie burger is a pile of slop, cannot eat it without it falling apart. The fries were cold. Staff aloof and incompetent. We ordered a side of roasted vegetables. It was roasted potatoes. They said \"potatoes are a vegetable\" and were satisfied with keeping the extra $1.50 charge on our bill. I asked to speak to the manager or owner. No one was on site to listen. The waitress was not apologetic nor did she even attempt to try her hand at customer service. Save yourself the disappointment and avoid this crappy diner."}
{"text":"Food was delish but they could do with more staff.  The three that were there were run off their feet."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here. Ordered 2 eggs Benedict's, 1 with sausage. Ended up getting 5 thick slices of ham on everything. The ham was flavorless and tough. The dessert went straight into the garbage bin, it was so messy and inedible. It was our first and last time trying this restaurant. I should have checked reviews before we ordered."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a friend, as they have gluten free banana bread french toast. So my husband offered to take me for a breaky on Sunday and I picked here. 

Finding out the eggs benny are also GF made my meal decision more challenging. Thankful my husband went the french toast so I could have some and I got the bacon benny. 

The french toast was sooo good, but definitely too much for me to have a whole meal, was great I could just have a couple pieces. The eggs benny was delish! Thick hand-cut bacon, gf biscuits and hashbrowns. 

And reasonable bill. We each had an orange juice and a coffee & baileys, plus the meal for $40. The wait thing sucks, but as long as you're there before the 10:30 rush you're good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been going to the fine diner for years. When we first started dating he took me there on several occasions. Hands down they had the best eggs Benedict I have ever had in my life. This past summer we went after not going for awhile, and apparently in that time new management took over. Unfortunately, the eggs Benedict is no longer the best I've ever had. It went from being amazing to just edible. The hollandaise sauce was chunky and tasted like vinegar and mayonnaise. We are both truly heartbroken and are now in search of Calgary's best Benedict."}
{"text":"Shut up... you had me at bacon.

Instead of a classic diner, Fine Diner is a \"classy diner\", who partners with local producers to serve up some delicious brekky, and they've got some of the best bacon going.

I've been around the bacon bend, sampling all this city has to offer, and there's something about Fine Diner's bacon that is a real standout - very rich in flavour, and not overly salty or fatty tasting. Just.. the perfect bacon.  If I knew how they  cured it, there is no doubt I would go mad with power.

Bacon aside, the Eggs Florentine was delicious, and very colourful. In a breakfast word dominated by beiges and browns, Fine Diner really spruces up their food with fresh green onions, and a colourful fruit selection. See my picture of this one because there's no way doing it justice.

If you're into Calgary breakfast spots, this should definitely be on your list of places to try."}
{"text":"Wow what excellent food and presentation of it! This is a welcome new addition to Inglewood. 

Both my wife and I had the nutella banana stuffed french toast, it was perfectly cooked, not too sweet, but just right. They even caramelized the bananas. 

The service was great and worth the wait. Friendly staff with personality. 

My only wish was that the prices were a little more affordable; you can go down the road to Blue Star in Bridgeland and get as tasty a meal for $3-4 less with a larger portion. Never the less I will be back."}
{"text":"I adore the Jalapeño Cheddar Burgers from Fine Diner! The cheese is insanely delightful & the fresh sliced Jalapeños add fantastic spice!"}
{"text":"I live in Inglewood and have been here a few times and I just can't get into it. I'll start by letting you know the main reason for the 2 stars is price.  The menus list price including tax and gratuities and still I feel the prices are unfair.  5 bucks for a cup of rosso coffee, which I could walk 10 feet and get for 2.50 at the rosso cafe. 20 bucks for a Benny with hasbrowns. I just can't.  The food is always tasty but the portions are too small and I leave hungry. The service is always changing but usually friendly.  I'd skip it, sorry to say. Inglewood has a few cute and affordable diners from the truckstop to the Vietnamese cafe when you enter the hood from downtown."}
{"text":"It's YYC Burger week so I selected the place based on the burger that was presented being offered by The Fine Diner on the yycburgerweek.com site. The Surf n Turf burger proved to be a disappointment. The burger is described as 5 oz beef patty topped with lobster warmed in garlic butter, cheddar cheese, housemade garlic aioli, red onion, lettuce, tomato on a butter brioche bun with a pickle spear on top and served with a side of house cut duck fat fries. I opted for salad instead of fries. The presentation was pleasing, my salad served in a wide mouth mason jar but the burger didn't look like the photo, for one thing I wasn't sure that was anything in between the bread except for a very flat patty and cheese, the only seasoning I could detect was salt and had to take a quite sniff to make sure that there was indeed some lobster in there. Upon tasting, there was really no flavour other than salt. I couldn't tell there was garlic aioli on it, the patty was home made but the beef used flavourless and the lobster looked and tasted like cardboard. I have never been to The Fine Diner before so based on this experience I would not be in a hurry to return. The salad was dressed with a balsamic vinegar dressing and the overall flavour was vinegar, not a good balsamic vinegar taste, the cranberries were supposed to balance the flavour but because of being served in a jar they had all sunk to the bottom and hard to get to. For those of you on YYC Burger trips I would give this place a miss unless you were on the hunt for the taste all 30 burgers prize."}
{"text":"The Fine Diner serves their full breakfast menu all day long. Hooray!

Today, I tried the banana bread french toast that is listed on the menu as Awesomeness. Meh. It is gluten free, that is a plus. They do a beautiful job of presentation, sliced bananas around the plate, sprinkled with vanilla bean sugar (I think) and torched (bruleed?). I thought that that was a great touch, sometimes it is the little things. I wouldn't order it again or recommend it necessarily but that is based on personal taste. My husband's Pacific eggs looked fantastic and tasted great too.

This was the second time we have been to the fine diner. The first time, we ordered off of the lunch menu. Everything was fantastic, truly. We both had burgers, in house seasoned, hand pressed patties with creative topping choices. Fantastic.  I had the honey-rosemary potatoes for my side ... oh my yum. Highly recommended!  My husband had the fries and to this day swears that they have the best fries in all of Calgary.

I really appreciate that Fine Diner has made it a priority to source their ingredients locally. The room is lovely, service good, menu creative and food generally great. They serve  diner-type food and add the 'fine' in the details."}
{"text":"As a pre-fathers day brunch (1 day early), decided to take the parents to the Fine Diner in Inglewood other than their usual spot in the SE at the Bow Valley Ranche. We were not overly impressed with the service that we had at the Fine Diner. Upon walking in, the hostess was just waiting for us to say something to her rather than greeting us. Our waiter was not very attentive either. Took us a while to get our food and never got our glasses of water. Small details, I know, but we definitely felt the lack of service. 

The only redeeming factor for the Fine Diner in our eyes - making this an A-OK sort of place - was the food was really good. I ordered the Maple Duck Eggs Benedict and that duck was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  I also liked the various mixed potatoes (Red, Golden, Sweet, dark) in the potato hash mixture. Was a nice touch. Hats off to the chef! Well done. He/she just needs a better front of room staff to really get this place noticed in my eyes.Had the food been average this place would've gotten just a 2/5 stars, but that duck! Well worth the extra star."}
{"text":"Breakfast food here lived up to the good reviews.  I got the breakfast Sammy with ham- the side was hash browns with multicolour potatoes that were crispy, not greasy, and totally to my taste- they were super delicious.  
The breakfast Sammy itself was quite large and pretty tasty with farm fresh egg and a dense, sweet, nicely toasted brioche bun. 
Coffee mugs are small- I had to get frequent refills because of the small mug size.  
2 hour free street parking right in front- what a bonus!  
I was here enjoying brunch with friends who I hadn't seen in a while- so I admit we were chatting a while after eating, but with all the times I have eaten out at a variety of places, I don't think I've ever been requested to leave like we were today.  I guess we ate and paid, so they were ready to make more money.  I am not taking a star off because I get it- just be prepared that this place is small and not a place for visiting, as other just as delicious brunch places are."}
{"text":"I've lived near Inglewood for 9 years when I noticed this place on my commute to work. I love eggs Benedict and my SO and I decided to make our way over on a Sunday morning. 

Upon Arrival: 
There were two other tables eating. The diner was empty otherwise. They told us there would be a short wait wait as they prepared our table.  

Wait time: 
20 minutes for the table - off to a bad start.
They put us in a corner where the booth leather had been ripped apart, mattress exposed from being picked apart. It was cold and we were beside a window. They gave us some water and menus.

The Menu: 
Great selection! Eggs Benedict is my favourite, so I was ecstatic to see so many variations. Comes with very colourful potatoes!

Ordering: 
This was awful. A semi-empty restaurant and no waitress for 25 minutes. She came around and did not ask us if we wanted drinks but I ordered a tea with my eggs Benny. 

Food and drinks:
Food was cold and potatoes dry. I think it would have been great warmer though.
My drink had lipstick on the side of the cup and I was not given any milk or sugar although the table beside me was given without asking.. I was upset and told her about it. I didn't get a new cup for 15 minutes.

Service:
 well.. I'm typically a quiet customer and so is my SO. I told her about my drink, finished my food. I left before she came back as I saw so upset. She asked my SO how things were and he said: \"quite frankly they were terrible.\" She replied pretty rudely
\"That's too bad.\"

This is the only time we have never given a tip, she was very mean about it."}
{"text":"We stumbled onto this place by accident and were very happy we did. Sandwiches were excellent and the special touches were amusing -- salad in a sealed jar and fries in a mini fry basket. Knocked off one star for somewhat soggy fries. The chicken bacon club was outstanding!"}
{"text":"I am not a bacon girl.  In fact, I don't eat it very often.  But when I ordered a three egg breakfast at Fine Diner, there were 3 fat pieces of bacon on my plate along with the three eggs (of course), hash browns, 4 fluffy slices of multi-grain sour dough bread perfectly toasted with just the right amount of butter, and a fruit garnish (a handful of blueberries, an orange slice, a strawberry and a slice of melon).  

I'm hoping that Wendy P or Jennie M, my dining companions, will be posting a pic of my meal since I happened to go here the day after my iPhone took a little plunge into a bucket of ice water.  But I digress...

Back to the bacon... Wow.  The bacon at Fine Diner is the perhaps the best I've ever had.  In fact, if I lived in Calgary, I'd likely become a bacon girl just because of the bacon at Fine Diner!  Everything else was also delicious and our service was attentive.  Prices are moderate and the neighborhood of Inglewood where this restaurant resides is super cute.  I just wish I had more time to explore.  Thank you Wendy P for suggesting Fine Diner - that was some damn fine bacon.  So fine, in fact, that it blows my mind! (Hey Mickey, Hey Mickey!) ---- Sorry, had to go there!"}
{"text":"Nice diner for breakfast and brunch. Good menu, nice interior. The service was a bit slow and the items on the menu could not be modified. Overall, worth a try if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Insane prices for mediocre food. $27 burger that was extremely dry. Slow service and very hot room. Bacon covered in some sort of syrup."}
{"text":"Grossly overpriced brunch spot and eggs benny were brutal!  They don't do single Benny for smaller appetites, fine, but don't even \"allow\" you to choose two different kinds. Should have been our cue to exit this place. Hash is so so dry but did like the multi-colour potato approach. My friend got the classic with ham and that pig slice was GROSS! Grisly AF and no flavour, took it home and fed it to my dogs. Will NEVER be back to this place."}
{"text":"Hit and miss:

Love the quaint retro decor. Love the gluten free availability. Service was meh, and food also meh.

Eggs Benny for me, of course. Thought I'd try the 'Diner Benny' with prosciutto. The English muffin was cakey, and I swear it barely saw a toaster, making it limp, and therefore soggy with the eggs. Maybe it's a gluten free thing? Does the bread not toast properly?!! My bf's eggs were way overcooked. I can seriously poach a beautiful egg with my eyes closed and one arm tied behind my back, and I have no culinary training. Kinda ruined his 'bacon Benny.' 

The roasted potatoes were completely doused in pepper. Kinda off-putting. The fruit was lovely, except for my moldy grapes, and off blueberry.

Service was über attentive to start, then dropped off to a near ignore. We had ordered mimosas, though, so happy to sip and chat, to a point...

I'd have to try it again to be sure, but I think you are taking your chances."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. We love the location. Good cuisine and super friendly crew! Honestly don't understand the bad reviews.
They made a small mistake on my order so they provide a 50% discount on the bill (without asking or complaining).
Also tips are included in the prices (i still gave then a good tip, totally deserved it)
We will definitively come back!"}
{"text":"We used to come here a lot. I think today is the last time though. Got in line using the no wait app and it said 5-15 minutes. So not bad. 35 minutes later we were sat after I had to bother the hostess. She had no idea how to use no wait. Our server was kind but forgot the water we asked for 3 times. When we got our food my toast was cold.. butter hadn't melted so just cold butter on toast. Bacon was all fat. Eggs cold too :( she never came by to ask how everything was. Only giving 2 stars because I love their potatoes. Very unfortunate experience. Won't be back again."}
{"text":"For such a nice setting and beautifully decorated place, there seems to be an atmosphere of bravado. The middle age lady who greeted us was ok but not accommodating. Her face was flat the entire time we were there. One server for the entire diner. The coffee we had wasn't at par with the other diners we've been to. The blueberry pancakes weren't fluffy, they were also under seasoned and slightly burnt. Tasted like paper unless you closed your eyes and soaked them with real maple syrup, then yeah, you won't know you're eating crap. With the price you're paying, they couldn't even provide you real maple syrup, seriously?...Aunt Jemima!!! You would expect something very good considering their price command with all their menus. Honestly we came here to check the place due to it being covered in a TV cooking show. We were wrong. Not much to say with the rest of the food we ordered, they all tasted the same like the ones you find at the corner of each busy thoroughfare. Totally dissatisfied and disappointed."}
{"text":"First of all let me start by saying, I wanted to love this place. I have wanted to go FOREVER and I was so excited to get the chance.

But I could not WOULD NOT love this place... it failed to put food in my face... :(

#1. we were put in the waiting room to wait for the last person to arrive.... I understand if its a large group... but if 90% are there to wait for one? ... hmmmmmm ok...
#2. Service. Our server didn't seem to happy to be there, nor did he seem to care to explain the daily special to us.. i had to ask, and also ask what the difference between the special and the menu item with the same name was.
#3. After ordering, everyone else's food came out... except mine. I had asked for my eggs poached medium-hard. he said my eggs broke all over the plate so they had to re-do my order. I asked how they would have broken if they were cooked as I asked, he said when eggs are poached they can break easily.... ummm usually only if they are soft but hey I like being argued with first thing in the morning....
so I waited... and waited. everyone else ate, my food came out... the eggs were barely poached with the whites still runny. I had to send it back AGAIN, by this point most of the table had finished eating... and sharing hashbrowns and toast with me so I wasn't left out... no apologies, nothing. I changed my order to one egg, ate it and left, and for the record it was cooked wrong too."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience here the first time I went, probably a couple years ago now. The server was rude and condescending, and nothing on the menu seemed special to me. I live super close now though so I decided to give it a try again. So first time- bad service and mediocre food. Second time-good service and food. Third time-good service and food. Fourth time-bad service and mediocre food. I think consistency is key in the service industry, and there is none of that here. After my last visit I don't think I'll be back for awhile. I ordered the Croque Madame today (same as my last 2 visits, I'm boring) and asked for avocado to be subbed for the meat (they offered to do this for me last week and it was great). The server told me they never have fresh avocado, they only had it for the avocado toast special today so it was all already mashed up. He said they haven't had fresh avocado for a year. I told him they did that for me last Sunday no problem. My order came out with the avocado (great) but without the sauce. When I asked about this the server said it had been put on the bottom of my dish but it wasn't there. So he brought me out a small side of it, which was great but he was acting condescending and not apologetic at all. I wasn't being rude but he was treating me like I had been a total jerk or something. 
I would love to support a local business like this but I can see why it's never that busy when I've gone in now. I don't care to be treated poorly at brunch. All the other servers I've come in contact with there have been lovely but unfortunately that doesn't make up for my 2 bad experiences. Maybe because the servers aren't motivated by tips they don't care about consistently offering good service?"}
{"text":"The Fine Diner has been one of our favourite restaurants since shortly after it opened but the last few visits have been less than satisfactory. Last visit I ordered the Duck Bennie and the husband had the salmon frittata which was a little on the dry side but other than that he enoyed it. I lke my eggs cooked but they always overcook the 'medium' eggs so I ask for soft which are always under-cooked - still looking for the 'perfect' poached egg there.  

The duck on my Bennie was overcooked and the maple 'glaze' was non-existent so I asked for a side of hollandaise which was a tasteless. The fried potatoes were over-cooked and dry and in general the food was a disappointment. Our server was a repeat of the previous visit; it must be hard to get friendly, accomodating people as she certainly wasn't. Unfortunately I don't think we will be going back again anytime soon. :("}
{"text":"I love that diners are all the rage right now....but don't love the line ups to get into said diners!  This diner is well worth a trip into Inglewood.  We came after the lunch rush on a Saturday and only waited 20 minutes for a table...this was doable with kids.  

Small inside as most are but enjoyable atmosphere with friendly staff.  While they are a kid friendly diner, I was not happy to see they do not have kids options or a kids menu.  Most kids (not all) are not big eaters, mine included and ordering them an adult meal doesn't make sense.  So we ended up ordering them a few sides to share.

The adults at the table went for burgers.  I had the Texas Burger feature for yyc burger week and the other guy had a burger off the menu.  House cured bacon, jalapenos, cheese, crispy nachos...my burger was dripping wet deliciousness.  The other guy devoured and loved his burger as well.  The fries were crispy and salty just as perfect fries should be.

It was a warm afternoon and the burgers went down even easier with a cold beer.  This diner is everything a diner should be and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Excellent food, fun service.  I tried the eggs (good), bacon (excellent) and banana bread french toast (spectacular).

We had a group of six, and while we had a reservation, it had been lost - so we ended up waiting for about 15 minutes.  However, the waitress/host was nice and welcoming.  There are about 20 tables in the space.

Biggest problem, though, was with the timing.  We placed our food orders and the food arrived about 20 minutes later.  However, one in our party, who has a very queasy stomach at the moment, order eggs benny with extra-hard eggs.  When the order arrived, the eggs were fairly soft.  The waitress was great about taking them back to the kitchen, but I'm guessing the entire order was placed at the bottom of the list to be remade - meaning she had to wait about 25 minutes (until the rest of us were finished) to eat.

Other than this part, great experience.  I would go again, but be very specific with specialty orders."}
{"text":"So delicious!!

I've been here once before for YYC Burger Week, so I was really excited to return for brunch last weekend. We walked in and immediately noticed 2 free tables, which was really surprising given that it was past 11AM on Saturday morning. We were then told there would be a wait (boo!) and taken to the big, bright waiting room in the back. I was glad to have somewhere to sit away from the bustle of the front door!

We were seated quickly but it was a tight squeeze - I don't really like being elbow-to-elbow with a stranger while I'm eating, but we were starving. We ordered Caesar's to start, while I had the Breakfast Burger and Raissa had the BLT Benny. Our food came out quickly but I found it a little awkward that our server just stared at us from the kitchen area while we started eating. My burger was INCREDIBLE. The thick cut bacon was complimented perfectly by the caramelized onions, and the egg was the perfect addition as it wasn't too runny or messy. The hashbrowns were fantastic and I practically licked my plate clean.

Although the space is cramped and the servers a little creepy, I really enjoyed this place and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went last week for lunch and had a great experience. The food was excellent, it came out in a reasonable time, and the server was hard-working and polite
The portions are generous, and interestingly served
We will be back, and I have to say in large part due to our excellent server!
Well done, great to see somebody taking pride and enjoying their job."}
{"text":"Oh Fine Diner you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind, hey Fine Diner! And a Fine Diner it is. Easy, tasty diner food with a little more effort put into the decor than your average diner, so far, it seems to match the name.

I was never in the space when it was Capo, but it's a pretty good lookin' spot now. A few tables in the middle and along one wall and one great big group table over on the other side. A single flower adorning each one, salt and pepper shakers shaped like eggs and coffee mugs that come with a stir spoon already attached. 

I was there for lunch on a rather cool day, a comfort food kind of day. You know what makes good comfort food? Diner food. In particular, mac & cheese. And Fine Diner's got four different kinds on the menu! I opted for prosciutto. Other options: veggie, bacon or jalapeno. It also came with a piece of garlic toast on top. That's a whole lot of carbs in one sitting, my garlic toast stayed on the plate.

The rest of the menu includes appys like tacos, sliders, and deep fried pickles and mains like sandwiches, burgers and a couple of home-style items like spaghetti and meatballs and meatloaf. See? Diner food. Go figure! :p

Anyway, I'm hopin' to pop back in for breakfast or brunch one of these days. The blueberry pancakes on the breakfast menu caught my eye! But as it is with pretty much every single breakfast spot in Calgary, I have a hunch this one's also busy on weekends, so it'll be a weekday breaky for me!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but not my favourite place for breakfast! My first visit over a year ago was fantastic, but now I'm just not crazy about this place! Only thing I still love is the bacon! My fave!! But I had pancakes this time and they were just okay!! Fluffy but dry,and I needed a whole jar of syrup! 
My hubby had egg Benedict with duck, not as good as last time just ok. Hash potatoes are good but that's it! 

Coffee is horrible, lukewarm and latte is no better! Sorry won't come back!
Service was good! But nothing special!"}
{"text":"After an intense workout at a new gym, brunch was much needed.  Renee mentioned the Fine Diner, I've heard about the Fine Diner, read reviews and looked at photos but I was hesitate because I thought it would be super busy before lunch time on a Saturday, Renee reassured it should be okay.

The Fine Diner is located in the heart of Inglewood, along 9th avenue.  It was a Saturday around 1145am when we arrived and to my surprise, we got a table right away!  We were seated near the main entrance next to another table which felt quite cozy. The dining area is super cute and seems small but apparently there's more dining space in the back!

Shortly after being seated, we were handed menus and poured waters.  I heard good things about the stuffed toast and it looked even better when the table next to us got two orders of it....super tempting but I was feelin' meat and eggs.  Renee and Julia both went with the spicy bacon frittata and I was torn between the duck benny and the sausage benny so I asked the server for his suggestion but he didn't help much \"both are good\" he says. :\ sometimes I just need someone to tell me what to order and I was hoping he would!!!... I decided to go with the sausage benny.  After we ordered, I noticed there was a board which the featured specials on one of the walls. I really wish the server would have inform of us the specials right off the hop because normally I would try the specials out! But that's okay....:(

We were chatting away when our orders came.  The frittatas looked like a nice size with a mix of jalapenos, cheddar and bacon, served with some tomatoes and fresh fruit!  My benny came with a mix of potatoes and fresh fruit as well. I cut the egg in half to see the nice bright orange yolk...mmmm!!!  The potatoes were great, regular potatoes, purple yam, orange yam - a great mix and they were crispy which made them even better. The sausage was house made beef and pork, really tasty and tender.  The hollandaise on top, made for a picture perfect benny.  Renee and Julia seemed to really enjoy every bite of their frittatas.

I'm definitely a fan of the Fine Diner and will be back! My only suggestion would be that they should introduce themselves as well as any specials that are featured!"}
{"text":"This is a classy looking, intimate diner and smaller than I expected.  I'm very grateful that there was no line-up for my first visit during the lunch hour today.  A group of six had a reservation which I think was a smart choice.  I will admit to feeling annoyed when restaurants don't have their own free parking but if you're willing to walk about 2 blocks from the East, you'll find some like I did.

I struggled to decide what to eat, as many of the menu items are very appealing.  Honestly, I would have opted just for an adult milkshake (Kahlua included) as advertised on the board if I didn't think I'd be judged by my lunch partner.  I ended up trying the Ahi Tacos and Deep Fried Pickles.  I'd never eaten Ahi before and not only that, I'm not a fan of raw fish.  The pan seared Ahi walks a fine line, I have come to realize and a few bites were a little too raw for my liking.  I retch a little thinking about it but overall, the tacos were very good.  I lathered them in the accompanying chili lime aioli.  I really liked the Deep Fried Pickles and was happy to share them because they are quite filling.  I sampled my friend's fries which were good and because I like cute and novel things, I'd order them for myself the next time just because of the adorable basket they sit in.  

I had asked our server if there were any menu items the Diner is known for and he said everything is amazing.  Oh, really?  I think I'll return and determine that for myself."}
{"text":"What happened???  This place used to be great and now it's marginal at best. Went for breakfast on a Saturday and there was only one other table, should have suspected something.  We were blown away at the pricing, eggs benny over $20, coffee $4, come on!!!   Well we stayed and ordered, hunger makes me weak. The food Arrived, meh At best.  My potatoes were cold and they forgot the bacon, they did bring 2 measly over cooked, warmish slices when I pointed it out.  The pancakes came with no butter, what kind of animal eats pancakes without butter.  
I will say the service was good.  
The bill arrives And its $42. for TWO PEOPLE. And for 2 of the cheapest breakfast items on the menu. 
We pay and leave but the value proposition remains a conversation.  We look up on TripAdvisor to find that pricing includes tip.  Well maybe that could have been mentioned!  Even with taking that into consideration, I just don't think it's within my perception of great food for value.  
So to get to the point, I'd skip this place."}
{"text":"I so wanted to give this place a better review but after eating here, they should just move on to something else. The first signs for me of a restaurant not paying attention to detail is the water closets were not up to snuff. One washroom (the one I first used) the paper towel machine didn't work and there was nothing to dry hands with. The other washroom the same but they did have a roll on the counter and they did not know where to find any more rolls in the restaurant. Second, I could see the wait staff were trying but they all came across as inexperienced. Third, the most important was the food. The presentation was ok but the food was barely edible. I left with a stomach ache cause the food was so bad. I had the kale and (I think it was supposed to be wild mushrooms) mushroom benny's but both the bread and the kale were soggy. The hollandaise sauce on the bennys was disgusting at best. The most important thing about that dish was the mushrooms and they were canned button mushrooms. My wife had a sandwich and the same thing the bread was soggy. I did like the variety of potatoes used for color and flavour. Fourth the prices were outrageously expensive, especially for this crap.

I will not be returning and caution that if you don't have a strong stomach for terrible food, then eating here may not be a good idea."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch during the week. 
Place was clean and bright. 
Food was pretty good and I liked the philosophy of giving back to the community and using local ingredients. 

Server was a bit strange - making off handed comments to everything u said or asked. I think he was trying to be funny - but jut wasn't. 

At the end, the server lifted up my napkin off my finished plate to make sure I wasn't hiding \"uneaten food.\" Good thing I ate it all as I'm not sure what he would have said."}
{"text":"I have eaten here once, and tried again today. My first experience was awkward, I am thinking or hoping it was the waiters first day as he seemed very unsure as to how to help us. The food was good though. Nothing amazing but good. I actually can't even remember what I ate. Today I went in and the girl at the door told me she had reservations that she had to keep tables for and would take my name as she thought it would a 20-30min wait after that. We just walked around for 1/2hrs and went back as there was no call. She told us again that it would be another 20-30 min wait. No problem, I only wish she hadn't wasted our time waiting if there wasn't going to be any tables and instead either told us it was going to be an 1hr wait or would I like to make a reservation for another day. 2 bad/awkward customer service experiences. I will have to be convinced to go back."}
{"text":"Omg. This is the best place for eggs and bacon and hash browns. So so good.  The quality of the eggs is by far the best I've ever had in the city.   Highly recommend and worth every penny!  
Also clean place with fantastic services 

Only issue I would prefer better quality chocolate milk but not that big of a deal."}
{"text":"Went for a group lunch.  We all really enjoyed our meals and had great service.  I enjoyed the alberta Benny that came with steak and soft poached eggs with a nice hollandaise.  The duck poutine looked awesome as did the mac and cheese.  Yummo! I liked the little details like the salad in the mason jar.  Our server was great too!"}
{"text":"Just ok.
It's super cute location and freakishly fast service can't seem to help it over come the fact that it was largely unremarkable.  The highlight seemed for me to be rainbow hasbrowns, which were surprisingly crispy. 

On a positive note this place totally embraces it's social conscience, supporting a number of non-profits including the Calgary food bank. Menu prices include tip so anything you leave beyond that is donated."}
{"text":"Usually when I attend breakfast establishments I am always disappointed by the selection of preserves to make friends with my toast. It's always the usual suspects of Smuckers marmalade and strawberry. I always swore if I found a restaurant that had a cherry selection, I would eat my own hat. 
Not only does Fine Diner not have Smuckers, they stock Hero jam and have black cherry. My mum always snags these from buffets in Europe and sends me samples of hagelslag and Hero wrapped in a precious saran bundle. I teared up a little. 

As I munched on my hat, I found our visit to Fine Diner the perfect addition to a sunny Saturday morning. I love the space with the high backed wall bench and the use of mirrors to open the room up more. Each table was adorned with its own brightly coloured flower in a coke bottle vase sitting next to the large supply of Hero jam choices.

We started off with 2 coffees and a smore milkshake to share. They serve 15 Kilo coffee and our server kept the java flowing.
The smore milkshake was amazing and it even came with its own freshly made smore on top! I ate it up and got chocolate all over my face and fingers and looked like I had momentarily swapped bodies with the 2 year old at the table next to us.

I really enjoyed the food, I had the stuffed french toast and the chef's stuffing selection that day was blueberries. I like how it was not drenched in syrup so you could still taste the brioche and there was plenty of whipped cream for spreading. The boyfriend went for the 3 egg breakfast. His bacon looked delicious, none of that dried out, thin, closer to beef jerky than bacon you see at some breakfast joints.

The one thing I was a little nervous about was while we were waiting for our food to come out, we noticed two different tables send back plates of food. I notice this was mentioned in other reviews because of egg orders. Of the plates we saw sent back one was an order of pancakes, the other was the stuffed french toast. Maybe the guy likes more syrup on his?

I had a great experience and will definitely be returning!"}
