{"text":"The food is typical Americanized Asian (love the crab rangoon), but the atmosphere is what really keeps me going back. Very small, cozy restaurant that's on the darker side and has a nice fireplace in the dining area. Service is personal, friendly and prompt. There's something about this place that draws you in on a cold, dark night. Bonus points if it's snowing."}
{"text":"Always a pleasant experience. The food wasn't that great last time. We haven't come back since."}
{"text":"The chicken fried is really good. I ordered extra spicy and it is exactly extra spicy. Loved it.!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is OK, but the atmosphere needs some serious updating!  I have had better food a the Mall type Chinese restaurants, and service could be better."}
{"text":"I'm very picky on where I go for Chinese food. I've had some bad experiences at some places but not here. The food is good. The service is friendly. Whenever I have a cold or am just not feeling well their wonton soup is a must. The broth is just what I need. The prices aren't bad either. Don't get me started on the fried rice. Plus it is easy to get to."}
{"text":"Picked up something for carryout, first time, just moved down the rd. I only order vegetarian when picking up Chinese food but I must say the presentation/food is solid! It came in a styrofoam container that had a plastic bag wrapped around it to retain the Heat, and came with a little bag of soy sauce  fortune cookies and tea, I declined sweet and sour or spicy mustard when I was asked. lomein noodles were thinner than the usual but very tasty. Egg rolls were very fresh, will go again for sure!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing meal.  My husband and I have been looking for a sit-down Chinese restaurant and were hoping that this would become a go-to for us.  The menu was disorganized and difficult to sift through.  The soups were the best part of the meal.  The egg rolls were lukewarm but tasted alright.  Our meals were bland. The ingredients - meat or veggies - were fine, but the sauces had no taste.  Even though only one other table was occupied, we were sat near a coffee/hot water urn. The server was draining water out of it during our whole meal which was distracting and annoying.  We took our meals home because of the disruptions at the coffee urn and the lack of flavor.  I would not go here again."}
{"text":"Average Chinese restaurant. Good prices. Quality is OK, but nothing to go out of your way for. I don't want this to appear as a negative review, I'm just saying that if you crave Chinese and you're nearby, this place is OK. If you want an extraordinary Chinese meal (and don't mind paying more),  you're better off going to Rocky River's Pearl of the Orient or North Olmsted's Wild Mango,"}
{"text":"I've been holding onto a restaurant.com certificate for Asian Wok for some time.  I bought it during a wave of nostalgia because my parents took my sister and I there all the time when we were kids.  But the reviews really scared me away.  We finally decided to stop last night on the way home from work.  I was too tired to cook and I didn't want to let the certificate go to waste.  If anything, at least it would be another notch on our \"tour de Cleveland Chinese joints\" belt.  I turned to my Asian-persuasion BF on the way in and uttered my disclaimer \"if this place sucks it isn't my fault\".
Andy you know what?  It honestly didn't suck.  I actually enjoyed my meal.  True the dishes are very Americanized and lack any type of complexity, but the vegetables and meat were very fresh and of good quality.  Any Chinese place that doesn't use sketchy chicken pieces in their dishes is all right with me!  The potstickers were homemade, according to my personal Asian food critic, and very tasty.  I enjoyed the eggroll, also homemade, and their spicy mustard was nasal-clearing good!  Of course the BF had to order the Mongolian beef.  The sauce didn't have the necessary sweetness to it, but he said it wasn't \"half bad\".  Sigh, he's such a Chinese food snob.
They restaurant was nearly empty, and yes we were the youngest couple in there by about 40 years. But the server was extremely nice and on the ball.  The decor is cheesy and old school, but I kinda dug it.  Its a place you can't expect too much out of or take too seriously.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  I had to laugh at one point when Deck the Halls came on the radio and I had a Christmas Story moment.  If only we had ordered the duck! Fra ra ra ra raaaa, ra ra ra ra ;-)"}
{"text":"Really nice restaurant.  Some have said the decor needs updating but it it kind of retro.  Friendly staff and service.  They still bring the dishes out in the metal dishes with the lids.  Food was wonderful and reasonable.  Location a little hard to find, not in a plaza."}
{"text":"A convenient place for Chinese food.  Have visited regularly and am usually satisfied. My favorite place for MuShu pork, never disappoints.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars was the crab Rangoon, another favorite dish.  Last night was served fried wontons, masquerading as Rangoon.  There was but a hint of cream cheese and no crabmeat, I questioned what I was served and was assured it was Rangoon, when I showed the lack of filling, I got a shrug and the conversation was over.  Will get pot stickers next time"}
{"text":"Try the LEMON CHICKEN! The best egg rolls around, too. Super friendly service. Since I've eaten there, I won't even try egg rolls elsewhere. Old school friendly and dine in food served on covered plates. While not a \"five star\" dining experience, the five stars in my review are well deserved for high quality food matched by top notch service."}
{"text":"This is the only place where I will get Chicken Chow Mein from.  I have been getting it here for years. 

The only problem is the food quality is not always consistent. Sometimes I find it to be overly salty."}
{"text":"I  lived in Bay Village for 30 years once we moved to North Carolina We can't find a Chinese restaurant that serves food that is edible compared to Asian Wok. I'm in town visiting and stopped by Asian Wok hoping for a delicious Chinese meal and they were closed down. Why?? Are they really going to reopen on 6/11/18.  say.. YES! BECAUSE I'LL STILL BE HERE FOR 2 MORE WEEKS! I NEED A GOOD CHINESE FOOD FIX!! Yum!! ** I haven't been there in 15 years. Does Nancie still run the restaurant? She was such a caring and devoted  manager!!"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss for me. I've enjoyed the Singapore noodles once and the next time not. I don't know if it was a different chef or what. The service is always very good and quite friendly.  Honestly I like the atmosphere of the place. You're gonna think I'm crazy. It's an old restaurant and it feels like it. It has a full bar but never sat at it. My kids like the sweet and sour chicken. Their fried rice is good. The portions are generous. But the food can be just ok. The place has a lot going for it but the food needs to be more consistently good for me. I'll give it a while before I try again. I'd definitely go back myself but probably won't recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's the atmosphere that makes it. It's great inside, with a cool retro vibe that you can see a lot on the coasts but for some reason not in Cleveland. The menu is decent, they have exotic drinks, a very cool old school bar that. A quiet Chinese dinner for two? This is it!

What I don't get is when some people take a historic place like this and say it needs \"updating.\" How sad of an outlook is that. Here they have real furniture, not the restaurant supply chain junk that every new mall restaurant has. It has feeling in here.  If you \"update\" it you'll ruin it, and turn it into just another generic cheap new place."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food and they are always supper quick when we do take out.  They make all their sauces in house, the spicy mustard is our favorite.  All the people who work there are really nice too.  It's nice to have quick, good food close to our hotel."}
{"text":"If you are looking for fancy-shmance, this is not the place. However, if you are looking for good food, friendly service and a quirky atmosphere; you've found it. 
We came here for Christmas dinner. I had been years ago, but it was my husband's first time. We usually go to a couple of other Chinese restaurants, but I wanted him to try Asian Wok. He was impressed! Yes, they have boxes piled up in the bar area and trinkets all around. It's a good \"dive\" feel. We were met with smiles and kindness. The food was delicious; he had the beef and broccoli. We also had fried rice; which he says usually needs to be doused in soy, but not here; perfectly seasoned. 
This was a wonderful Christmas meal and we will definitely be back, throughout the year!!"}
{"text":"I had not been here in a very long time but from what I recall (& do not think my memory is fading) the food in the past was wonderful as was the service.  I went there for the 1st time in a long time this past New Year's Eve (12-31-12) .. I will NEVER return.  Granted they were busy so I did not mind that my reservation for 7pm was pushed back to being seated at nearly 8pm.  I figured we would just be more hungry for good food.  The WonTon soup was TASTELESS .. no seasoning at all .. dishwater probably tasted better (in their defense they took it off the bill) .. we ordered dinner for 3 .. each item took longer than the one b/4 it to arrive at the table & by the time the final dish arrived we were simply no longer interested.  The service was slow & quite rude as well .  Thankfully we had not opted for take out .. several people waiting for take out were there an hour or more .. some walked out .. I wished we did the same .. 50 bucks down the drain!"}
{"text":"I think the last time I went to Asian Wok I was about 6.  Although the ambiance is a little strange, I was thoroughly satisfied with the food.  I judge pretty much all Chinese places on the crab rangoon, and it was pretty decent here.  They had specials too, some sounded great."}
{"text":"The WORST general tao's chicken I've ever had. It was a big mushy mess. No taste at all. The pork fried rice was also tasteless.  I haven't been there in a couple years. I read a couple recent reviews that said it was good. It was just awful."}
{"text":":/ Thought we'd try somewhere new... regretted it.  We ordered the \"Kung Bow\" Chicken and General's Chicken.  The Kung Bow sauce was okay, but there was hardly any chicken, and it was mostly just celery.  My boyfriend got the egg drop soup, too, and he did say that that was actually very good.  My General's chicken sauce was bland and not like any other General's sauce I've had, and the breading was kind of soggy."}
{"text":"Not good. I have now tried this place 3 times and that will be all.  The General Tso is so far off it's ridiculous - it tastes like hot and sour soup on their fried chicken. A few week ago I tried their lomein.....blah and flavorless.  I have not had anything here that I would ever want again or remotely thought was worth my money."}
{"text":"Do not go here! They treat customers horribly! 
Wanted to take my Grandmother to a local restaurant that my Grandfather used to like to take her to and bought a coupon from Restaurant.com to use.  The place smells foul when you walk in and the food was nothing exciting.. When I gave them the gift card they were mean and even angry with me saying they don't except these. I was very embarrassed since my grandmother was there with me and they made a bit of a scene in the middle of the restaurant.. I will never go here again and hope this story will make you choose to not visit this place either!"}
{"text":"Not good.  The egg roll was the best item.  Soup and garlic chicken were pretty bad.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This is your basic Chinese restaurant, sort of looks like a throw back to the 70's, could use some serious updating. That's about all I can say since my lack of competence in design is well known. On to the food, went with a co-worker, ordered wonton soup, a bit salty, steamed dumpling, pretty good, but small in size, compared to what you would typically get.  Egg roll typical which is good. I had the beef chow fun, which is a wide noodle, this was really good, I ate the entire plate, maybe because it really wasn't to large.we had an older Asian lady take our order, she was very nice, could have been the owner. All in all a solid 3 dining experience, just what you would expect.  I would go back because if they can produce it consistently I'm in."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! My family and I have been going here for years.
Very good food, kind and  friendly staff, cozy atmosphere."}
