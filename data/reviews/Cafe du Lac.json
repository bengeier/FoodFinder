{"text":"This place fails on its service (our visit was height of busy time on a Saturday night).  But excels on its food.  So how do you rate this?  Price Range (per person): $26-$60  Visit Again?: Maybe  Party Size: 2   It would be so easy for them to fix their service. Get a maitre d who can handle a drinks order and maybe get an entree going, or table bread or something but at \"fine dining prices\" service has to be there.  Here's my review:  We were new neighbours looking for the best place to eat nearby and targeted cafe du lac. We walked in, were brought to a table then totally ignored. And I do mean it took 20 minutes before we were asked for a drinks order. Which then proceeded to arrive a further 20 minutes later. I was angry by then. Starving and ignored. All this while we watched the proprietress (is that a word?) fraternize with a large table of guests as if they were the only people in there. Now I think that's a great thing, but with customers waiting for service, we simply felt like 2nd class, warty rejects, not worthy of attention. Then a table of 5 fellas walked out too, exclaiming loudly about the bad service... actually they said \"the worst service we've ever had\". They had been ignored too. My martini arrived without any garnishes, and my husband's apricot beer (which I ended up drinking) came without a glass. Table bread never did arrive. And we could not get the attention of anyone to discuss this. Now understand - these are fine dining downtown prices charged here. Paying those prices, I want the experience.  Finally someone took our food order. Trout on a bed of lentils, with rapini. Exquisite. Delicious. By then it had quietened down a bit and my martini & half husbands beer had kicked in. He was now the only one pissed off as he wasn't impressed with his poutine, but I was tipsy and having a good time.  If they could fix their service they're the only show in Mimico, other than Everest which is nearby and great Indian food."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this place zero out of 5, and I'm usually quite generous when it comes to ratings.  I have never, in my life seen a place that is run by an owner (Katheryn Ashby) who is so full of themselves and their restaurant that could leave a voice message on my machine where she yelled into the phone about how rude it was to not call and let them know we would not be attending dinner.    Not only that, she told us that we were BANNED from her restaurant for ever and that she would appreciate it that we never visit them again and how we would not be welcomed.  (Contact me if you want the mp3, it is UNBELIEVABLE) ... I've never been to her restaurant, and I never will be, and because of this, I recommend that you look at the other reviews being mentioned here and how Kathryn Ashby treats her customers.  Anyways the people we were going to dinner with (there was 4 of us), the other couple had gotten into a car accident and his wife was taken into the hospital.  SORRY Katheryn, you were NOT the first person on my mind!  (Don't restaurants give up tables 15-20 minutes in?  If not, I don't believe that you left a table open all night for hours...BS).  Unbelievable.  You know, unless you know what is going on in that's persons like, your are totally wrong in assuming that YOU should be their first priority.     All i can say is ... WOW...."}
{"text":"We visited Cafe du Lac while in town, and were pleasantly surprised by both the food and service.  The seafood was clearly extremely fresh and the sides tasty and well-prepared.  Service was attentive and helpful - he was able to guide us in wine selection and went the extra mile to make sure we enjoyed our visit."}
{"text":"We were going to use Cafe du Lac to cater our wedding.  We had shopped around and Kathryn (the owner) had given us a fantastic quote.  We decided to use them after tasting the food and we did enjoy the food to be fair. Kathryn's quote more than doubled after we added in 25 people and it came time for her to crunch the numbers. We were shocked and she basically admitted she screwed up the first quote big time.  She did not apologize or offer any sort of compensation. Needless to say, we found another caterer (Jayne's Gourmet Catering who was amazing!) I was not impressed with Cafe du Lac's attempt to run a catering business or Kathryn's ambivalent attitide at losing a customer."}
{"text":"Food was marginal, service wasn't bad, prices were high.  M'lady and I had an appointment for 5:30, which turned out to be when they opened. We got there at 5:15 and waited in front of the venue until 5:29 P.M. to have the door unlocked.  The appetizer included with the meal was 4 slices of white bread. M'lady and I shared a veggie poutine appetizer, which we rather enjoyed. I had a lamb meal that consisted of beans, beef, and a potato slices and stacked. I found the meat to be rather chewy and the sauce to be a tad sour. The potato was really nice. For desert, I had a blueberry crême brulée which was unevenly torched at the top so there was some untorched sugar in some parts. I did not find its taste very appetizing either.  The service all-in all was OK. No table checks, but I personally prefer having more time to spend with m'lady. The waitress did spill my water at one point on the table by knocking my glass to the side with a plate, and never came to clean it up.  I wouldn't mind trying the Sunday brunch at some point, although this venue is a bit above my usual spending range. I'd also likely come back for the poutine, however the rest of the meal I wasn't a huge fan of."}
{"text":"An amazing meal and a very friendly owner who gave us a tour of the menu.   The food was great.  I was told that the Duck was \"to die for\".   I had the steak frites, and wow!  The steak was cooked to perfection, and paired very well with the home made red pepper chutney. The frites were very good too, especially with the home made ketchup.   A few Quebec beers to wash it down, home made bread, and great coffee made it a total success.    Desert looked good too, but we were too full.   I will definitely be back.   Also note that they have a very active twitter feed, and that I asked a few questions over twitter before I went and they were all answered promptly."}
{"text":"I visited Café du Lac during Summerlicious and had an amazing dining experience. The service was wonderful and the food was fantastic. For starters, I had the foie gras poutine topped with pulled beef short ribs. They've received a lot of attention for their poutine, and deservedly so. For the main course, I had the duck magret. Both dishes were absolutely wonderful. The only downside is that they're all the way out in Etobicoke. But it's closer than Quebec, eh?"}
{"text":"I'd been so excited to eat here ever since we moved to Etobicoke, especially after some great reviews from friends. We finally went back in March for my birthday and I wasn't overly impressed.  The people were great - really helpful and laid back. The food however - was pretty middle of the road. I had pork ribs that were rubbery and covered in fat (not cooked nearly long enough). My wife had a great filet mignon (undercooked for her liking) but the sides were totally forgettable.  Over all I was a little disappointed - I'm willing to accept that it might have been the dish and not the establishment and I would go back - but I'm in no rush."}
{"text":"I stopped by for dinner last night after reading some good reviews.  I had the poutine, which was pretty good buy I'll try something else next time I visit.  My friend had the grilled salmon which was amazing.  It's definitely on my list of places for dinner, but not quite in the top 10."}
{"text":"Cafe du Lac lays claim to having the best poutine in Toronto and this is an honour well deserved!  Aside from the gloriously gooey and sinfully delicious foie gras poutine, Cafe du Lac serves good quality straight up French Canadian fare, simply but expertly prepared."}
{"text":"Cafe du Lac was an amazing experience.  I had found them on the list of Winterlicious restaurants on a whim and my girlfriend and I chose to go there as the menu seemed to have the most appealing food.  I was not disappointed.  I ordered the poutine, the duck confit, and the maple syrup tart. My girlfriend had the farmer's pate, the braised lamb, and the apple crumble. The food was delicious, the service was fantastic, and the environment was cozy and warm.  Kathryn Ashby, who owns the place, greeted me very warmly as soon as I entered, and showed me where our table was. We had a very nice chat after our meal and I will definitely be coming back during non #LiciousTO times, just to experience the duck in a jar when the place is not so jam packed.  Thanks for the great dinner!"}
{"text":"During summerlicious 2010 was when I first noticed Cafe Du Lac. I was intrigued... I checked out the website and loved the idea of the french canadian dining experience, my husband and I decided to give it a whirl. We enter into an empty restaurant and were promptly greeted by the hostess. She's super friendly and explains the overall experience we will be looking forward to ... \"a Hearty French Canadian Meal\" *insert hand gestures to indicate MONSTROUS HERE*. We order a couple of beers, the Assiette charcutiere (sm), Poutine cremeuse and pain de viande. First the Assiette, it came with foie gras, venison salami, a pate and thinly sliced duck. The plate itself isn't what I would describe as hearty at all, It was more dainty than anything. The foie gras was beautifully done melt in your mouth good, the ice cider glaze paired perfectly with the silky texture of the foie. The venison had a very intense wonderful red colour, but in your mouth it resembled salt lick. Due to the overwhelming taste of salt, you can't appreciate the venison. The pate was smooth, and came with a fruit chutney however it was so forgettable that I can't even remember what it tastes like. The Duck was... interesting. The duck breast is dried and thinly sliced. These slices are about 1/2 duck fat and 1/2 meat. A blueberry drizzle is poured over it. When you pop a slice into your mouth, the duck fat automatically starts to react with the heat in your mouth and slowly melt away providing you with the unmistakeable flavour of duck. As you chew, the fat and warmth starts to interact and I can't help but think, this is like eating a very decadent piece of duck jerky. If you are wondering what happens to the blueberry drizzle, so was I. Unfortunately the duck flavour over powers the blueberry hands down, not even a hint of sweetness can combat the duck fat, meat mixture. Next the Pain de viande, so this is essentially a meat loaf. I expect a few slices of meatloaf over top a pillow of potato gratin. What I get is ...different. At first glance you can't help but notice a GIGANTIC BRICK of meat, yes that's right a BRICK topped with bacon and fois gras. The brick is surrounded by roasted beets, roasted baby carrots, what seemed like swiss Chard and MASHED potatoes. Not what I was expecting, however i'm still excited about tucking into my plate. I first attacked some of the roasted veggies, the beets had a good colour to them (a nice deep burgundy red and bright canary yellow) tender enough that you can cut them with a butter knife (yes the butter knife was the only cutting implement provided) but not over cooked. Next was trying these mashed potatoes that I wasn't expecting, now picture this, a little pile of white fluffiness on your fork making its way to your mouth. You clamp your mouth down and slowly remove the fork, you start to chew, you get the distinct lumps of potato from rustic hand mashed potatoes, next you focus on the texture now that you notice that it isn't boxed potato flakes that are dancing on your tongue. The texture is smooth, almost buttery but done just right. Now, to the main. THE BRICK. I attempted to cut it with my trusty butter knife but its a bit too dense and when I attempted to exert more force on the knife it ended up crumbling into an unattractive mess on the plate. I take one of the crumbles examine it, it looks safe to eat (due to the size of the brick, I worry about food born illness). I have a taste, its luke warm, dry, lacking of flavour other than salt, I am underwhelmed. Next I try a bit of the chard, its hot and it reveals the way its been cooked, either with the same pan as bacon or cooked with bacon fat, I personally love the smokey taste of bacon so I clean the greens off the plate. Now back to the brick,  I look at the piece of fois gras, with grand memories of the fois from the appetizer I had earlier, I cut into it, Its undercooked.  The waitress walks by and I ask if my husbands Poutine is coming, she explains that she forgot to put in the order, I'm thinking to myself please bring it out, I'm hoping the poutine can redeem some aspect of my original excitement to coming to this restaurant in the first place. I continue to pick off the clumps of demolished cold, salty brick pieces when the poutine comes to the table. Instantly I'm excited again, but oh no another piece of fois. At this point I must admit I'm Fois'ed out! But my love of poutine begs me to continue. The beef short rib is butchered, it resembles brown confetti, there doesn't appear to be a gravy just some cream sauce that just reminded me of the dreaded american processed cheese. *sigh* I had high hopes, and even looked for ANY redeeming quality but it never came. If you like a nice waitstaff and underwhelming over priced food make your way over to Cafe du Lac."}
