{"text":"Good food the protein portion is pretty big for all of them, souvlaki pita and shawarma plate  with garlic sauce and baba ganoush my favourites, recommended for people working in the area"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat in the area. Good prices and always delicious food. For lunch today we ha lentil soup and falafel pita pockets. So good!"}
{"text":"Here at night. Not too busy but not deserted. Mostly takeout customers. Got the greek salad and a pita. Very tasty and a good value. Gotta ding them on only giving 2 olives on the salad though. See photo pic. I will be back here."}
{"text":"Very fresh well priced. Veggie plate is grilled, lots of extras, and friendly professional staff. Love this place."}
{"text":"I've said it before, this area and this plaza are not the greatest for non-asian food. If it wasn't for the lunchtime office crowd this place would be out of business. Value for money is not good when you compare to other restaurants (outside this area) offering similar choices. Meat portions are small for the price you pay. The manager is all smiles because he's making enough profit on ripping you off. He tried to charge me a higher price for a similar menu item but he wasn't gonna fool me. Prices are just too high for people who are just trying to eat their daily lunch. Eating healthy is good, but at this place you are paying a premium for it"}
{"text":"I go here about 2-3 times a week for lunch, and I love shawarma so let me break it down...  Food is good!  This place is mainly an office lunch place and the place gets pretty busy at lunch time.  I only went once after work hours so cannot speak for it.  Why I give this place 5 stars?  Reason, you get the taste, fresh food, and its healthy....What else could you ask for?   Go in and try it for yourself.  Take a look at the freshness of the vegetables and toppings and you will know why I go so often.  Typical meal for me is the chicken shawarma pita (the sandwich), or the chicken shawarma plate (rice, potato, salad).  I would start there your first try.  If you like that, then check out the menu for more your next time.  If you are an office worker in the area, I recommend checking it out.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This joint gets a big pass. Food is tasty and always fresh. Love the Sharma platter and the fresh veggies. Usually take my lunch after 1:30pm (if you come beforehand be prepared to wait in line) The owner is a nice guy and always remembers your preferences. You won't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"\"Your healthy alternative to fast food restaurants\"  Melodie's is a great restaurant that provides nutritious Mediterranean cuisine. The business is owned and operated by a good friend of mine and his family. They are all great people and this shines through with their excellent customer service.   Melodie's has a very large menu and they specialize in catering. Standard Mediterranean appetizers are available like houmos, taboule, and baba ghanouj along with grilled vegetables and fresh salads. The rest of the massive menu is comprised of shawarmas, kebabs, pastas, rices, meat platters, sandwiches and pita pockets.   I typically order the chicken shawarma plate and I am never disappointed. The portion is sizeable but the food is very light because of the way they cook it. The food is not greasy, heavy or overpowering in flavour, it is just right. Accompanying the shawarma meat is a nice bed of white rice, salad, and my favourite grilled vegetables like the eggplant which are marinated in olive oil, vinegar, salt and pepper and then charred on the grill then re-submerged in the prior marinade...!. Aside from the shawarma plat I have also tried the chicken souvlaki, again very tender, juicy and by no means greasy.    In addition to the wonderful shawarmas and souvlaki are the falafels and kebabs. I have yet to try either and they are on my to do list for the near future as I have heard they're great. Recommended to me are the beef shish kebabs made from tenderloin, supposedly to die for and on the to do list as well.     If you are looking for a healthy alternative or simply to switch it up, give Melodie's a shot."}
{"text":"Will pinch a penny over satisfying a customer.  The food is good, unfortunately I had a bad experience with the service. They mixed up an order with the guy in front of me, and instead of offering to create my meal (that I already paid for) with the toppings of my choice, they tried to pass it off as if the guy ahead of me had already chosen what I wanted - he didn't - which I found out later. And the guy behind the counter saying it was the same toppings was not even the one who put together the meal.   Really disappointing and will not be returning again for this reason."}
{"text":"Not bad..not great..first time here.  I got the felafel supreme (~$8).  The felafel was a patty instead of the typical balls.  He basically warmed it up on the griddle and then put it on the grill to warm it up.  The toppings were good and made up for the OK tasting patty.  The guy was friendly and service was good.  It was a good portion, as I was full after just that."}
{"text":"We decided to try to place because the place next door was closed. Opted for the special that was posted on the door, it's a kebob and rice for $6.25 or something like that. It took about 15 mins to make the meal. It didn't taste like anything special, in fact, it didn't have much of any taste at all. We didn't enjoy this meal, it was bland and there are other restaurants that make a better kebob nearby that we would rather eat at."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Melodie's, which serves Mediterranean cuisine.  I ordered the chicken fillet dinner with rice and potatoes.  The chicken was freshly grilled for me.  The rice was good and the tzatziki was tasty.  The potatoes were the only weak point ... they were a bit cold and overspiced.  I'd get this again but without the potatoes.  The fella who served me and cooked my chicken was pleasant."}
{"text":"I have to drag my friend away from Hero Burger next door so I can try some of the Healthy selections at Melodie's...   Specials of the Day are written on the chalk broad right by the cashier...   Beef Kebob (Kafta) and Greek Salad to share was a perfect lunch. The lemonade was a disappointment though as it didn't take fresh at all.   Services was friendly.   If you in the area, and you want something different than just Asian food... I definitely suggest to give Melodie's a try!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Melodie's for a little while now and I've had a few mixed experiences. I've always been satisfied with the food- it tastes great and doesn't leave you feeling regretful for overindulging since their portions are quite generous. I tend to get the chicken shawarma or the chicken kebob dinner with potatoes which is light but quite filling.   My issues have been with the service and presentation. On a few occasions, I've left only to find sauces oozing out of the container (and all over my car). First lesson learned- always ask for sauces on the side (including dressing for the salad)  My second issue is that I've received different levels of service that cause me to react differently each visit. There's one male that works there that will always ask what toppings I'd like for my salad, which sauces I'd like on everything, etc. The level of service he provides is what I'd expect- I always leave satisfied when he serves me. The last few visits I haven't been asked what I'd like and have found ingredients I don't like/are allergic to being put on my food unexpectedly. I also have had 3-4 different people serving me at the same time so I had to keep repeating what I ordered and how I wanted it prepared.  Overall, I will continue to return to Melodie's since they offer great quality food in comparison to their local competitors (which is mostly fried/fast food). I would have rated them higher if I didn't get frustrated from spilled sauces, mixed up orders, and long wait times (during non-busy hours)."}
