{"text":"My coffee was good. I really love the seating arrangement, very practical and comfortable. They feature works from local artists on their walls which is really cool! Their prices are decent, you really are getting what you pay for. The cinnamon rolls are fantastic, you can tell they make them fresh by hand, and they're gigantic. They offer dairy alternatives, and their lunch menu is solid. The staff is a funny mix, I was there during the lunch rush so they were kind of rude at first, but they were way nicer and pretty cool after it slowed down."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for 9 years! It's not even the closest coffee shop to my house yet I still go out of my way to stop in a few days a week. The staff is SO friendly, it's nice to see the same faces over all these years. I can see why they keep their people around because they are always so accommodating and so friendly, it's obvious they all enjoy working there :-) It makes my day to stop in :-)"}
{"text":"WOW!  The Misty Valley Coffee is absolutely exquisite.  Hints of blueberry flavor to finish.  Just out of this world incredible!!!  How do they do it!!????"}
{"text":"Comfy, groovy, easy-going coffee house that invites all the neighbors over for great tasting coffee & some mellow live music. I wish I lived closer because this is the type of coffee house I could spend lazy hours people watching, unwinding & sipping some of God's nector. Love the mix of contemporary art & old fashion lounge chairs. The location is as important to me as the taste and the taste is on point. Creamy, sweet, mild iced Americano was a perfect compliment. Food is also served here but I can't speak to that...yet! I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee place! The coffee is great, and the food is really good. I like it even better than Cartel (and Cartel is pretty good). I stop in here anytime I'm headed in their direction."}
{"text":"We came here on a morning we were desperate for breakfast before our spring training game.  Everywhere in the near several miles was packed for breakfast and we were in a bit of a hurry.  Didn't want typical fast food.  We wandered by this coffee shop.  Line was not terribly long but they were also quite efficient.  I was hoping for a breakfast burrito but the ones I wanted were not able to be done because they were out of sausage.  My wife and I rarely get the same thing but we went with what I think was a special.  It was a BBLLT, basically a BLT but with lox.  I wasn't so sure...but I was hungry.  It was a good choice.  The salty bacon with the tomato and the increased smokiness of the lox was fantastic.  The latte I had wasn't so bad either.  Ambiance was nice and service was good to.  If we were in the neighborhood, I would hit it up again"}
{"text":"Rude! I work nearby and come ever so often and each and every time that staff has been extremely rude to me.   It could have easily been my favorite coffee shop in the area (I rather support a local business than a national chain) but at least when I go to a national chain I know i'm usually getting excellent service."}
{"text":"This is the best coffee in town, some of the best coffee anywhere.   The quality starts with the roast, done in-house to perfection. If you've grown up on the bitter, burnt beans of the ubiquitous chains, this coffee will come as a revelation to you. And just as much attention and care is given to the brewing and pulling of shots (of course with filtered water) as to the roasting. The result is smooth, complex ambrosia where the individual characteristics of different beans can shine through.  While the coffee is sublime, there's little snobbery about it at Village. No one will look askance at you if you order an americano, a mocha, or a latte with more flavors than a Baskin-Robbins. But I do recommend trying the espresso straight at least once. You shouldn't miss out on that.  There's a limited food menu - sandwiches, soups, salads, pastries - and they're all fine. But, if you can come in on a Thursday or Friday, you might be able to snag some of the short rib before it's all gobbled by the regulars. That's a whole other level of delicious, rubbed with spices and braised in the shop's delicious espresso.  With some major remodeling just complete, the Roastery is more cosy than ever with an ample patio area and some very cool new architectural details inside.  Good coffee, good food, a comfortable atmosphere, and a cool owner. What more could anyone want?"}
{"text":"This cozy little coffee house is always a must before I head to work. Serving up lattes and specialty drinks, the Village Coffee Roastery is never one to disappoint.   With all coffee professionally roasted in-house and a friendly and effecient staff, you're never waiting too long for an americano before going back to the grind stone. Tastefully decorated with a vibrent atmosphere makes it perfect to post up with a nice book or to meet with friends. You'll be leaving the Village with a smile on your face every time, I know I always do."}
{"text":"Great cafe. While in town for conference chased down Village Coffee Roastery on Yelp and was not disappointed.  Came back three times with fam for starting out the day.  Excellent coffee and espressos.  Loved the patio."}
{"text":"The coffee beans here really are the best and I'm never jittery after drinking 4 cups (I'm looking at you, Starbucks). As someone who has also ordered  from Stumptown and Big Bend coffee roasters, I can say that I'm always happiest when I have bags of Village Coffee Roastery in my cabinet. The beans make for a very smooth drip coffee, especially the sidamo and peaberry (my favorites!).  Definitely worth a stop if you're passing through Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop in town.  People are great, coffee even better!  Be sure to buy some whole beans, they roast them there!"}
{"text":"Scottsdales best coffe shop in my opinion. I love the coffee, the atmosphere and the friendly service! I feel inspired creatively when I am here. Definitely a must if you are a coffee lover or if you just want a place to relax and read or write."}
{"text":"I've been stopping here for my morning cup of coffee for a few months as I work nearby, and I love it here. The coffee is amazing and the people are always cheerful and friendly. Not in a fake way, but like they enjoy their job and enjoy working with each other. The coffee is self serve once you pay for your cup, they have a couple different roasts out with descriptions of the flavors so you can choose what appeals to you, and refills are only $0.50. Last night before bed I was thinking how I couldn't wait to go back to work just so I could stop and get a cup of coffee...I figured that made it worth making a Yelp account and writing my first review."}
{"text":"By far the best coffee I have ever had. Love the atmosphere and staff. The coffee is always perfect every single time I go in there (which is around 5 times a week, oops) and the food is amazing. It is always fresh and I always feel very welcomed when I walk in. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I love the down to earth vibe at the Village.  They are really friendly and  I love all the changes to the decor they recently made.  The patio is nice - a really great place to sit and read.    I also really adore how there is a lot of fun (local) art up on the walls.  Oh - and the coffee is super good, too!!  :)  I love my Americano with Steamed Soy .  Best Americano in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Coming from across the pond, the wife and I had some trouble adjusting to American tastes, but ended up going to Village Coffee almost every day. On the down side, the mocha uses chocolate syrup and not chocolate powder, so we gave that a miss. A small Americano equates to an Australian long black, and a latte corresponds to our cappuccino - milk well-textured without excessive froth- though the Village Coffee's soy milk is flavored with vanilla for no apparent reason. The friendly staff got to know our tastes so there was no need to explain our specific requirements each time.   We didn't try the food apart from a muffin, which was nice and chewy. Would have liked to see more choice of cakes, muffins etc, since we didn't want a cooked meal.   It's a great place to hang out and read the paper, though seating is sometimes tight. If ever we return to Scottsdale we shall choose to stay within easy range of this place."}
{"text":"This place has the best coffee I've ever tasted.  We've been addicted for 4 years.  They roast their coffee on premises using scientific instruments to ensure the beans are roasted to perfection.  The coffee here just tastes so much better than other places.  They also have really good sandwiches, pastries, etc.  They have recently repainted, added lighting and put new artwork up, the atmosphere is really laid back, the staff is friendly.  Highly Recommended."}
{"text":"I met my friend Sam here. I read Gabi's review and I thought I should try this out. The place was neat and the people were friendly which put a smile on my face :)  I wish they had more selection on their menu, but all in all, it was a good experience.   Wouldn't mind coming here again and just relax with a cup of java.   They have free Wifi for those people who can't part with their laptops. Lots and lots of comfy chair to lounge around which is absent in most of the independent coffee shops, YAY for that!"}
{"text":"The hubs & I LOVE the Village Coffee Roastery. We typically ride our bikes up the greenbelt on the weekends to grab a coffee and a bite for breakfast.  The place is BUSY on weekends, but the food was served quickly, and hot. Here is a recap of this past weekend's visit:  The hub's mocha was good - better than he usually gets from Starbucks. I had a large coffee, which  I take black, and this coffee was strong, but smooth.  For breakfast we ordered a breakfast burrito w/ sausage, and a croissant sandwich with ham. Both were DELICIOUS, and the portion sizes are larger than we expected, but the quality is what we had come to expect.  It's a great little spot, locally owned, and full of friendly people. Very much worth the ride to get here :)."}
{"text":"Probably the best coffee shop you will find in North Scottsdale.  The coffee has a distinct taste that is much more smooth than your typical chain coffee.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place and love it!! Delicious coffee (I got a latte) of the perfect intensity and with even more perfect steamed milk.  Extremely friendly staff, cool decor.  As an added plus, this is an easy stop off of the Scottsdale Greenbelt bike path! What more could anyone want?"}
{"text":"great place...cool atmospehere...recommend"}
{"text":"I always buy freshly roasted beans from here. Always nicely roasted and fresh.  Can be a bit expensive, but not too bad for the quality."}
{"text":"I wish there was a zero star option...considering there was a long dark hair baked into my scone. My drink was sickeningly sweet, possibly to mask the taste of the awful burnt espresso. Smug regulars hoarding around the bar, and an all around arrogant attitude coming from the owner, Lisa.   I'll pass."}
{"text":"Finally found a good coffee place for these scottsdale visits.  Place is very nice and clean, and the coffee is quality.  Barista was friendly."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for the past 10 years. It is like Cheers, everyone knows your name! You DO have to be a regular for that to happen. The baristas see me coming and make my coffee before I can order it! The coffee is the best.  They roast their own beans. It is so good we have it shipped to our home every other week. The food is very good as well, everything is fresh. I recommend the tuna salad for lunch. You will not regret trying this place out and return again and again"}
{"text":"Great place. It was steady enough to keep the staff busy, and most of the customers seemed to be regulars. They (the staff) were pleasant and not at all fake, and they seemed knowledgeable about their coffee (it doesn't hurt that they roast).  My latte was great and the foam was amazing. Very velvety-sweet and creamy.  It's not huge, but it's a cute little set-up, and they have a good choice of tables (including two high tops) and a few comfy chairs. Definitely a comfortable place to come and hang out, type away, and pretty much be left alone.  The guys playing Risk are cracking me up."}
{"text":"I went to the Village Coffee Roastery on a busy Saturday morning and was pleasantly surprised. The coffee shop was busy, yet welcoming. On the front patio they had live music playing while when I walked in the doors there were local artists artwork hung on the walls. Although there was quite the line, everyone in the small shop seemed to know one another, which made me feel right at home.       While I stood in line to place my order, I browsed over the menu and realized how great their food looked. I was pleasantly surprised that while in line, one of the employees came up to me, asking if there was anything they could get started for me. This was refreshing considering most places where you are required to stand in line seem to take forever until any attention is paid to you.  I asked about their coffee and was hooked as soon as they told me they roast their own coffee. I quickly asked for a white chocolate latte and a Rooster Breakfast Burrito while my sister ordered their iced coffee. A couple minutes later I paid. The pricing of the coffee and the cinnamon roll was very affordable in comparison to brand coffee shops.       When I went to sit down when I realized the barista had already made our drinks and it was sitting up at the bar waiting for us. It was extremely well made and topped with a design of a flower drawn into the foam. It wasn't bitter, not too much milk nor foam; it was perfect. The iced coffee on the other hand was the best I had ever had. You could tell the espresso they used to make the coffee was roasted in shop because it was nothing like the bitter stuff you get from Starbucks. The breakfast burrito was out of this world. It was made with eggs, short rib, pepper jack cheese and a chipotle aoli all wrapped into a delicious flour tortilla. The short rib was tender and savory without being too heavy (but yet filling). It was the perfect combination of spicy and savory without being too overpowering. My sister and I spit it and could not help but want another one (although we resisted).      Although everything was very good, the service was exceptional. From the moment I stood in line to ordering to picking up our drinks the people behind the counter treated us as though they had known us our whole lives. They made us feel like it was our own personal coffee shop from start to finish. When we were through enjoying they came and picked up our plates and asked how everything was, it could not be better.      If you are ever in the area and are looking for a great place to grab a quick cup of coffee, hangout for a bit, or grab a bite to eat, this local coffee shop is it. You will not be disappointed with the food, coffee or service."}
{"text":"Delicious. Quick and friendly. Did I mention delicious.  Salsa verde eggs, protein cakes and a Lox scramble."}
{"text":"Great stop after a breakfast at Butters.  On a Saturday morning there was a live musician singing singer/songwriter tunes.  Great great atmosphere to relax and take a breath for a sec."}
{"text":"Wow,  the people are very nice and the Coffee (mocha) was awesome. Ordered a sandwich and it was so good I was tempted to order another even though I doubt I could eat it (I was full)."}
{"text":"GREAT place and GREAT coffee. Feels like a coffee house in San Francisco. The coffee is excellent and the people who work there are always wonderful !"}
{"text":"The place has a homely kind of atmosphere , which is nice. So I tried the cappuccino and a bagel. The bagel was good, the cappuccino was pretty rough. Ok tore lax but disappointing coffee."}
{"text":"Excellent iced mocha. Friendly staff and fast service. I was on the run so didn't stay to check out the snacks, though I will be back."}
{"text":"Their black iced coffee is my #2 choice, thus far. It verges on smooth and delicate. Their food choice is great and everything is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We ordered black eye iced coffees and they were wonderful. Flavorful, robust - will definitely return when we are in the area."}
{"text":"I found this place just by plugging \"coffee\" into my GPS. It was fairly easy to find. I ordered an iced chai with a shot of espresso. Pretty tasty. I also ordered the lunch special:  short rib sammie with a side salad. I thought the prices were a tidge steep. $3.50 for a small iced chai? $9.75 for  a sandwich? While the sandwhich was tasty, I'm nearly certain it wasn't worth what I paid for it. I may be willing to test this place again and just skip the food."}
{"text":"This is the best coffee house in AZ; they have the best red velvet cupcakes."}
{"text":"Beans are over roasted (because I feel mean saying \"burnt\", but it appears I still said it..) and their espresso machine and grinders were dirty. It sounds trivial and silly but trust me: clean coffee is (more often than not) good coffee. If the grinders and machines are well cared for, then you know, more likely than not, the baristas are also taking care of the coffee. The shots being pulled seemed inconsistent and under or over extracted. It definitely tasted over extracted in my mocha, and even the chocolate couldn't salvage the drink's dignity.   Customer service was relatively sweet--at least one employee's attitude compensated for the others'. But for specialty coffee, it only seemed like they had all the right equipments for the show, but no one knew how to use them properly."}
{"text":"Being from the Northwest, I'm always on the look out for a good coffee place.  No, not the wild exotic mixed coffee concoctions, but just your basic strong coffee that tastes like it was brewed in an old enamel pot on a camp stove.  Although most of the corporate coffee shops have their \"bold\" coffees, they just don't do it.  And throw in some bagels, muffins, pastries and reading material, and I'm good. So I stopped by here with some friends the other day, and was pleasantly surprised.  They do their own roasting and grindings, and have really good flavorful coffee.  They also have pastries, muffins, and minimal  sandwiches.  It is nicely decorated with a few really comfortable chairs on the inside with counter seating and tables.  There is also outside seating that is really pleasant on those warm Arizona mornings.  A plus is that they have free WiFi, and newspapers and magazines for comfortably relaxing over that morning cup of coffee.  Surprisingly, although  I have been back several times, I haven't tried any of their food or pastries. To me, it is all about the coffee, and great doses of caffeine.  For that, they get four stars.  They have the best tasting coffee I have found in the Phoenix area, and although they don't always have their strongest available, I can always find one that I like.  It has now become my morning hangout."}
{"text":"The coffee here is oh so good and can't hurt that the coffee is roasted on site. Some comfy chairs and a couch.. who wants to go back to work after sitting down in a big comfy chair with the aroma of fresh coffee?! haha.   Some new paint on the walls and more art work, not to mention guy playing guitar and singing on Fridays (only day i see him there...) makes it a can't miss. Free WIFI too.   The breakfast sandwhichs and burrito's aren't the best but the pastries are damn good."}
{"text":"Nice spot tucked in Scottsdale, offering good ol' Joe. There's a mixture of old coffee instruments and new decor, adding a unique flavor to the cafe.  Drinks were alright, nothing special. The Hot Chocolate was nothing spectacular, and the music gets pretty loud at times drowning out any conversation. Studying or holding good convo might be a challenge here."}
{"text":"Been wanting to check this place out as my hubby and I are always on the hunt for a cool place to just chill and enjoy a cup of coffee or tea, but Garmin always leads us to the wrong corner of the intersection. Finally found it, with a little bit more patience.  It really wasn't that hard to find, our Garmin was just a bit directionally challenged ;)  THE PLACE: It is quite smaller than I had expected. It was just really a long rectangular area, with the barista station of equipments, kitchen, counter and food display case monopolizing the right side of the space. Directly to the right of the door as you enter, is a nice comfy space for customers to lounge, mingle, and access the network. And that they did. The place was semi-packed at 12:30 pm today. The left wall was lined with different size tables of different heights. And those too were filled with customers enjoying a sip of java or tea. Noise level wasn't really that bad, just people talking. I think there might have been music, but I can't recall now.  THE SERVICE: Was just okay. I played the first timer and asked what offerings they had that were iced that she would recommend. The gal behind the register looking quite bemused by my ignorance simply said \"weellll\" they really only had 1 iced coffee they offer, and if I was looking for a latte. Saying yes, she suggested vanilla to always be good. So I got a large iced one with soy. She didn't ask for a name to put on the cup (okay, I admit, I'm coffee chain trained, but if the system worked, why not?!) and was a bit worried I will not get my coffee. I did not wait very long though, and barista looks at me and says this is your bevy. Okay, cool. Where may I get a cover? Points me cooly to the condiment station conveniently located by the entrance/exit.  THE COFFEE: Was good. Not something overly exceptional, but good otherwise. Love that they use eco-friendly cups. That's a win.    I'll be honest, 5.2 miles for a cup of joe and the so-so experience, I'll stick to my conveniently located faves. Hey, but now I know."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place after having went to Butters, which is in the same complex. Now I'll admit, my coffee tastes aren't sublime- I tend towards more Starbucks than not. Horribly mainstream, sad to say. And you'll find going in that the menu is quite spartan, without complicated descriptions, which leave you... having to ask the counter staff, gasp!   No fear. They're super nice. I actually did ask for a macchiato the first time I was there, and when the guy made sure it was what I wanted the clueless, blank look on my face prompted him to ask me a couple more questions. To which I ashamedly admitted that when I think macchiato it means I just want something like my skinny caramel one at Starbucks. But he just smiled, said no problem, and jumped right into it! And man it was delicious. He did say something about vanilla and caramel and whatnot, but really, it was just delicious, and that is that.  He also mentioned that they add 2 espresso shots in there, not just one. So voila! More bang for your buck.  The place is a really neat little joint. The decor is great, I love the art for sale on the walls and the teal velvet armchair by the front door. The outside is also dog friendly, which is very, very nice. Now I don't live anywhere south Scottsdale, unfortunately, but I do like this place enough that it warrants a stop in anytime I'm in the locale."}
{"text":"The coffee is outstanding.  Roasted fresh, on site.  But what is even more amazing is that the staff and baristas know most or at least many of the customers, by name and drink.  Customer service here is off the charts.  One other observation: unlike some other nearby shops, you can go here if you are employed or over 35 (or both) and not feel out of place.  Highly recommended.  Just don't go when I do. I am attached to my regular chair."}
{"text":"Best. Place. Ever...for coffee, well, south of Macy's in Flagstaff.  This place has been a stand-by for years.    They do all coffees from house to Americano to mocha's all very well - and their pastries are fresh and tasty, too.   Fun, busy atmosphere on a weekend morning.  Great place to grab a morning Jo."}
{"text":"Villager the coffee Pillager. Yes this is a great cup of coffee, the barista was well versed in his craft, and the coffee was delis'. Village Coffee roast the coffee on the premise and they have some very exotic single origin beans.  Also add free wifi and you have one of the best spots in Scottsdale to drink a great cup of Joe.  If it was sooo good why not 5 stars? Mostly I give out 5 stars for the most perfect place of all time, and that is hard to come by. The main reason for only 4 stars is that I was unable to try the brewed coffee as they had already dumped it out.  The cons are basically some pretty odd art on the wall, and the whole bean coffee is a bit overprices. They also do not have tee shirts, or any logos on the bag of beans, so you don't know what is in the bag or were it came from. The seating is a little limiting also for groups bigger then four."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing atmosphere. The food and the coffee was spectacular, the only reason Im giving them 3 stars is because of how extremely slow they are. It took almost an hour just to get me a sandwich and an Americano. Non the less they were very friendly. Just need to speak up!"}
{"text":"Awsome coffee, neat atmosphere. I would recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Stopped by here while visiting my son. He took me to this coffee shop. Great coffee and food. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Been going here for about 16 years now! Love this place so much. They've got great coffee, amazing pastries (the pistachio muffin is the best!), and quiches. The staff is always super friendly and knows a lot of their regulars by name. Be cautious if you go in the morning as they can get crowded, but that's because of how good they are. They still bust out all the orders very fast!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Good coffee, food and people. Music weekend mornings is a bonus. Get a rewards card if you come often."}
{"text":"Best coffee around. These people know what they are doing. Great neighborhood coffee bar."}
{"text":"Ordered a black coffee and a kale salad to enjoy while studying. The baristas give you a huge mug to fill from a thermos at the self serve station. It was some good joe so I dropped 50 cents in the refill jar for a 2nd fill.   The kale had a mango dressing, feta, dried cranberries and a sprinkling of pistachios.  Small for the price (Maybe they gave me the small size by mistake) as I later learned you can have any of their menu salads as a side to a sandwich order. Now that's a deal! Next time...   For midday, midweek reading it's not ideal unless you can deal with the noise. Each table was packed with small business meetings.  Friendly attentive, service from all staff.   I would definitely go back for a sandwich/salad combo or for a causal meeting spot!"}
{"text":"Great local coffee roaster in the Scottsdale area.  Conveniently located towards old town Scottsdale we went here in search of our morning coffee.  The place was packed on a Saturday morning but the waitstaff were getting people through quickly.  Coffee was flavorful and just like we ordered.  While it's not the best local roasted coffee I've ever had it was good, fast and well presented.    Ambiance of the roastery was what one would expect and indicative to the coffee culture.  Plenty of parking available in the area and easily accessible.  If you're looking for a good cup of fresh roasted coffee this would be a good stop instead of the chain coffee shops that appear to be on every corner these days."}
{"text":"First time here!! Service and taste were incredible!! Uses Ghirardelli dark chocolate syrup- the BEST! Don't usually drink iced coffee but I sure am a fan of it here. I Shall Return!! I view some of the food plates and I would order them in a heartbeat. Excellent value and service for a superb coffee outlet that truly cares about its customers.  Recommend: VERY HIGH"}
{"text":"Since arriving in Arizona, I've made a promise to myself to visit a new coffee shop every week I'm search of the best coffee shop experience that Arizona has to offer. This week's stop was Village Coffee Roastery.   The moment I walked in, I felt an indescribable feeling of joy. I don't know what it was exactly that struck me about this place, perhaps it was the roasting contraption right in the front with a handful of comfy chairs around it. Perhaps it was the blue tile half wall surrounding the bar area or the chalk board menu. I'm not sure what it was but I felt at home right away. The barista behind the counter greeted me as if I was a friend, we chatted a bit about the menu, I made a joke about their \"Why Bother\" drink. That's a non fat sugar free vanilla latte to those not in the know. I asked about their For Here mugs and he took the time to go over the sizes of the mugs. I ordered cappuccino and he asked if I like it dry or wet and I was blown away that he asked. THANK YOU! As a matter of fact, I like mine on the drier side. I stood by while he started it and he told me to go have a seat and he'd bring it out to me. What service!     When he presented my drink I geeked out over the foam and he asked if I needed a wifi code. So thoughtful! I sat back and enjoyed. I actually found myself sitting there, smiling to myself. Purely and utterly happy. Here's the kicker. Usually, at a coffee shop, I stick my earbuds in and ignore the world for a while. Not today. Their music selection was so perfect, so wonderful that I didn't bother. I could live at Village Coffee. I was one of 4 customers there and it really felt as if I was sitting in my own private, wonderful piece of heaven.   My experience at Village was so great, I want to take a star away from every other coffee shop I've been to because none if them have compared to this place."}
{"text":"This place great!  Amazing coffee, great environment and friendly staff!  Why would anyone go to Starbucks when this place is within 5 square miles??? I wish that they would open a location in north Scottsdale so that I could start everyday here!"}
{"text":"Dare I write yet another review for a coffee house? But of course I do! I love coffee and nice people, so this place is pure bliss. The coffee itself is great quality, the staff is most friendly and kind, and I can't keep my hands off that scrumptious banana bread the owner's mom makes from scratch! Whoa, slow down... I had the healthier side burrito today &... What the?!?! That tortilla was so dang good, she must a' picked that up fresh off the skillet of a humble Mexico abode. Yum"}
{"text":"Great coffee and breakfast! Thank the long wait at Butters for this find. Cute shop and food was very surprisingly good for a little coffee shop. Staff was great and has a nice little outdoor seating area to boot. I am from the NW and am a complete coffee snob by default. This place won me over."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop in Scottsdale. I usually just get regular drip coffee (self served) which you have at least 2 to choose from (usually one is organic) and a breakfast sandwich served on a bagel. Expect a line any time of the day that you go."}
{"text":"I really need to spend more time in Scottsdale.  This local joint is friendly and unassuming.  My colleague and I just had coffee.  If this was just the daily blend, everyone who comes here is spoiled.  The coffee was rich and delicious.  I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The best coffee in Phoenix and the surrounding area period. Its the smoothest and most flavor full cup of coffee I've ever had. If you have the opportunity to go , do it."}
{"text":"The best local coffee in town! Check this place out and support local businesses and get an insane cup of joe."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm a total coffee snob! Baristas NEED to know what they are talking about so they can explain it to me- haha! This place has coffee down to an art form! They have their own top of the line roaster so everything- everything is done in house. The barista's are more than willing to answer any question you have about the coffee they serve or coffee in general. They are all very knowledgeable an excited about what they do! From the couple of times I went there during my stay in Scottsdale, it seemed like a community coffee shop where eveyone knew each other and took time to invest in their relatioships over a good cup of 'Joe'. If I lived in AZ, that would definitely be my spot!"}
{"text":"I'm seated inside Village Coffee Roastery, elbow to elbow with a big old blue coffee roaster with a sign on it that says, \"Please, don't bring in outside food or drink. (We're pretty sure you'll like ours better anyway.) Thank you!\"  I'm in a comfy armchair facing the front window as the sun is beginning its slow evening descent, casting deep yellow beams across the small steel coffee table at my feet. A fresh Americano curls wisps of steam through the fading light.  The Americano is my second drink. The first one I ordered would have likely been a challenge most other places, but not here. It was what some coffee \"hipsters\" refer to as a PoMo (Poor Man's Mocha). PoMo = two pumps of mocha, cold brew, a little cream, and ice.  Lucas took my order, but had never heard of a PoMo. He enlisted the help of the barista, Fadi. Fadi had never heard of the drink either, but was more than happy to give it a whirl. No argument from either of these guys. I really appreciated that.  The drink came out really tasty and, as you already know, I ordered up seconds, choosing my go-to coffee this time - an Americano, hot and black. (It is quite tasty as well.)  All storytelling aside, I couldn't be happier with my first visit to Village Coffee. Both Lucas and Fadi were polite, helpful, and attentive. Truly wonderful service from these two. The drinks were good, and fairly priced.  The ambiance is perfect for working with plenty of local art, plenty of space, and even good music (their radio has been playing bands like Foals and The Wombats - right up my alley!). Plenty of seating inside and out.  If you haven't been to visit Village Coffee yet, I would highly recommend it. Just look at their ratings! Tons of reviews and just BARELY shy of 5 stars!? Solid. Come alone or bring a group of friends - there's plenty of room.  I'll definitely be back. I really like this place. A pleasant surprise, to be sure. Thanks Village Coffee, Lucas, and Fadi for making this visit an enjoyable one! Very good work guys. Very well done.  :)"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee! I got an iced mocha and it was delicious. Plus they made the coffee fast and were very friendly!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, consistently good coffee.  The staff is nice whether they get slammed with clients on the weekends or more slow during the week. To me the people who make the coffee make or break the experience as with eating out. So that being said, this place gets 5 stars for the awesome staff. This is one of my go to spots when in the area because they don't over charge for a cup of coffee and refills are 50 cents. Other spots in the area don't offer this. Plus they have a special card where you get a free coffee if you put some money on that card (kind of like a Starbucks card, can't remember details). Much better coffee then the bitter coffee found at a spot in the area that over charges and is served with an attitude."}
{"text":"This is a great local coffee shop! Fresh roasted coffee, great service, and fresh food. Probably why it has been here for so long. They will make you anything you want and not have any attitude about it. What a refreshing change of pace to the hipster coffee shops all over town."}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop. The coffee is delicious, the staff are awesome and they have good food too. Thumbs up from me, especially for their cold brew"}
{"text":"Best cafe au lait in town! Love going here on weekends for delicious coffee."}
{"text":"My coworker and I go here often.  We know the staff and they are always helpful and nice.  One thing they do well is a good cold-brew coffee.  The other thing they do right is their bread and baguettes.  Go there to try any soup they have on special.  They also do a great short rib sandwich on occasion.  In this part of Scottsdale there really isn't any place that is close for indie coffeeshops.    Parking is the only complaint as the bank next door has RESERVED signs up on more than a few spots.  So does TCBY and some of the other businesses in the shopping center.  It has gotten a lot more bearable in the summer months, however."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, customer service and they serve the new cold brewed coffee. Will definitely be back often"}
{"text":"LIQUID CRACK.  The coffee here is *really* good and the owner was once an air traffic controller.  He reads books on quantum physics for fun! At some point he quit his job and came up with a patented roasting technique and voila - fanfriggingtastic coffee.  Last time I was there they had a FreeBSD machine as a kiosk and Internet connectivity.  Not sure if there is wi-fi or not."}
{"text":"Great coffee & lunch spot with amazing homemade baked goods, soups and sandwiches (and occasionally the best Mac & Cheese I've had). I'm not a coffee drinker so I can't comment on the coffee, but my coworker raves about it.  Lisa (owner) is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about coffee, and it shows in the care she takes with every aspect of the shop.  Lisa and her staff are friendly and make you feel at home. Local artists' work on display and free Wi-Fi available."}
{"text":"great little coffee shop. They have great options for take home coffee as well."}
{"text":"There is a semi-decent patio out front of this coffee shop in the strip mall, but it depends on who is sitting there during your brief window whether you enjoy that part of the shop. On this day, we had the old guy who every 8 minutes would make a strange vocal noise that sounded like he was a walrus in distress. The tables are real close, so expect to hear other conversations, run across plates from the last dude that sat there and the flies visiting you. I managed to drink a cup of coffee and have the standard breakfast burrito before the Walrus drove me way and so did the Canadian visitors reveling in my AZ sunshine. The almost 6 buck burrito wasn't really worth half that price, but the burro was good enough for a small meal and the coffee (mostly dark choices) were average. The coffee fixing area needs some adjustment and TLC as it looks out of place and the communal table in the front is pretty uncomfortable for all involved. Eggs were fluffy and bacon crunchy, so it wasn't that bad of a morning stop, but would have rather had a better patio crowd."}
{"text":"I stopped in here yesterday for the first time and not 24 hours later I'm back again! If I could give 10 stars to the Coffee Roastery, I would!   I came in yesterday looking for sandwiches or salads for lunch. I thought maybe they only served coffee, but I was happy to be completely wrong! Yesterday I had their \"hippie\" salad with tuna on top and it was delicious, homemade, and very fresh. This morning I ordered the \"breadless breakfast\" (they also have an amazing variety of must-try breakfast burritos) which includes eggs, cheese and your choice of a breakfast meat. I also added a side of fruit. Everything has been spectacular- cooked to order, timely, delicious.  The ambiance is perfect here; chill place with many customers coming and going or relaxing with friends. This places possesses a lovely community atmosphere which is so often lacking these days. They can now count me as one more member of the Coffee Roastery community!"}
{"text":"I got word that they made good burritos here. Therefore, I stopped by after a doctors appt. The place was very clean and organized. I ordered the Almost Paleo burrito which turned out to be pretty good.. wasn't the best but not the worst."}
{"text":"Great coffee is hard enough to find amongst the national brands that spring up around central and north Scottsdale. These local hangouts with great coffee are typical around Phoenix. There are even a couple that have sprung up around old town (D'lish, etc..). Despite how busy they always are, the service is fast with a genuine kindness.  In other words, it didn't feel forced like the over zealous and obnoxious teenagers that you find at Coffee Bean and Starbucks.  We need more independently owned spots like this up north!!"}
{"text":"Gimme coffee!!!    Love this place and love their coffee (they roast their own beans)!  Life doesn't get much better than this....from the friendly service to the delicious coffee & food, the Village Roastery is hard to beat.  No snobby baristas found here, just friendly service!  And if by chance you're in the mood for some interesting conversation, this is the place to be.  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Super friendly little place with excellent customer service. Very quaint, neatly decorated, some comfortable seating and even the tables are quite comfy themselves. The coffee is delicious and while I've never had the food that they make, the smell of it coming fresh from the oven is enough to make you jump the counter and devour it in a frenzy. I'm sure it's delicious. Scottsdale is a mecca for coffee shops and this one is probably my #1 favorite.   Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The space is left raw and undone. It has a few black and white and color photos lining the wall, yet it is nothing like tony-esque expectations of The Village Shopping Center that you find at Hayden and Via de Ventura, yet its perfect in and of itself.   I asked for a large coffee (24 oz., $2.46). Okay, so its a little pricey, but the coffee roaster is there, on the property, and right in front of you. The intoxicating aromas (from the roasting) that fill the room will convince you to pay any price for this coffee.  I had the Costa Rica blend today - there's a sign that says - \"if you're on the patio and would like a refill, its .50. If you leave and come back, please pay for another coffee.\" I totally understand because when I finished my 24 ounces, I almost drove back.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"The coffee is great the decor is nice! I love the artwork! It seems to be a regular friendly type place but there was zero attention and very much a rush through the non regular person, I almost didn't get to order my breakfast before she started telling me the total for my coffee! Zero answering questions. I apparently am supposed to have the entire menu memorized on my first time there.   I love the renewable product cups, unfortunately the same doesn't apply to to go food containers:/   It looks like there are other coffee places I that complex. I'll likely visit another one over this one. The staff was not friendly or helpful in the slightest."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating is because in wish the outdoor seating area were larger.  Great coffee and the breakfast sandwiches are large and delicious.  My husband and I love to walk the Greenbelt here."}
{"text":"Disappointed  in the tuna sandwich - not Wicked anymore - just average Too bad we have been coming there for years - my husband loves the coffee and I'm sure we will come again we just probably won't be taking that sandwich"}
{"text":"Wow!  I went there thinking I knew what an espresso tasted like, with a benchmark from only Starbucks as the norm.  Now I've had some great coffees around the country from places like these but one soon forgets how a great fresh roast tastes.  Had the Espresso Con Panna, which I have to say was blissful.  Freshness, balance of the espresso and the cream with a hint of sugar was perfect.  Roasting your own coffee and grinding it fresh does wonders for the taste.    My significant other had the Iced Chai which again was amazing.  Great flavors and you actually taste different spices vs. the norm of a glorified over sweet one note Chai.  Will definitely be back and glad there are still businesses that take the time and pride themselves on a delicious product.  Also other pluses...free wi-fi, great atmosphere with local artists and super friendly staff.  So next time, why Starbucks???"}
{"text":"I live in the Biltmore with plenty of trendy places to grab a cup of joe, but will often go way out of my way to get here for the best Americano in town.  The owner/staff are what you would expect from a local coffee shop, but way more personable.  I never camp out at coffee shop (aka - coffee-clutcher) but will spend 30 minutes or so here catching up on emails/texts.  Friendly environment and awesome coffee. This is my favorite coffeehouse in the valley."}
{"text":"Lisa Stroud and her enthusiastic team do an outstanding job of dealing with the morning pressures of serving up a wide variety of coffee and tea products, augmented by an impressive array of baked and home made goodies...and consistently served with professionalism, recognition, a smile, and genuine enthusiasm.  She has an uncanny knack for getting to know her customers, even those who are new to the scene...  I like the joint, the people, the libations and the croissants!"}
{"text":"Had a latte the second time around and it was also incredible! Four years later, and it's still my favorite coffee house in the valley! The coffee is extremely rich, magical, and perfect! I really wish I lived close by, I would go here everyday.  The roaster is in plain sight, and there's local art you can purchase lining the wall. I bought a beautiful piece for $50!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Friendly, homely and great/friendly staff.  They specialize in the most obscure coffee beans and roast on site.  You can't get any better than this.  Also great Wifi, seating, power outlets for laptops, etc."}
{"text":"Sitting at my favorite coffee house as I write this review. I'm not sure why I've waited so long to leave a review. They roast in house and have the most delicious coffee I've ever had. Lisa the owner is a gem, always smiling and happy to see you. I've been coming here since 2003 and even though I've moved across town, I will leave early just to come here for my soy latte. Trust me, it's worth the drive. It's a great atmosphere and also a great place to meet people."}
{"text":"Fantastic espresso drinks! The beans seem to be a little over roasted but this is still my favorite place to get an Americano. I'm also usually not a latte fan but theirs is awesome."}
{"text":"The coffee Roastery is a zoo weekend mornings. So many customers, not much seating, loud acoustics. Not an ideal coffee shop to chill or do work in. I ordered a medium cafe at lait and was told to pour myself drip coffee and they'll steam milk and put it on top. The coffee to steamed milk ratio was off. Only had about half of it. The breakfast burrito was pretty good though."}
{"text":"Perfect neighborhood coffee shop! The red eye coffee that I bought was made to perfection! What really topped the experience was the customer service. The barista's were so friendly and helpful without being overbearing. Five stars!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and very friendly staff. Lisa, the rest of her crew, and the coffee they serve are an essential part of my morning. I feel like Village is my second home!"}
{"text":"All time favorite coffee shop! My school is right in the parking lot of the coffee shop so being able to count on this place when I barely role out of bed to get breakfast is always a treat. The coffee is smooth, the sandwiches and pastries are fresh, and the owner always welcomes you with a smile. It is a very comfortable atmosphere but there is usually a little bit of a wait. Worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I had an iced coffee and the Phoenix breakfast burrito and both were absolutely delicious. They have a lot of patio space and a lil doggy bowl for fur babies. The staff is great!"}
{"text":"Best plain cold brew iced coffee in town! Leah always brightens my day! They all do, even when the line is out the door (it's worth the wait, trust me).   Everything about this coffee shop makes me adore it from the large blue roaster to the local artwork on the walls.   They have a great breakfast menu and snack options for all types of dietary palates. My favorite is their breakfast burrito with only eggs, potatoes, and cheese. It comes with a side of delicious salsa. We always stop here before a road trip to split the burrito.   Before I turned into a cold-brew feign, I used to get their white chocolate latte. It is so creamy and delicious without being overly sweet. My boyfriend's go-to is a small iced latte with a small hint of their vanilla syrup. My dad loves their espresso to sip. My best friend loves the plain hot coffee of the day.   This is also the place I come to when I want to try something new because I know they have such high quality coffee that I will get the full experience out of a new drink."}
{"text":"I like hanging out at this place.  I usually meet my friend Anita here and we can spend a few hours chatting over coffee.  The place has a relax vibe and the coffee was very good. Besides coffee, they also have several items for breakfast and sandwiches and salads for lunch.  I went there on a Saturday and they have live music.  What a neat treat."}
{"text":"I come to The Village whenever I need myself a good dirty chai or breakfast burrito. Hands down favorite coffee shop in Scottsdale. Their food is AMAZING, and they have the best coffee- gives Starbucks a run for their money. I'd suggest this cute place if you're grabbing a bite or wanna sit down and drink a cup of coffee with a friend. Love love love!"}
{"text":"Looking for a place to get some work done and enjoy a great cup of coffee... I found it!! Ordered a large latte and a blt with lox and cream cheese sandwich... Delish!!!"}
{"text":"4 for coffee and brunch food. Great coffee and expresso. Food is brunch and very good. Try quiche, potatoes, tuna sandwich awesome. Say a 4 for basic brunch food and drinks."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite place to grab coffee in Scottsdale. Great coffee and breakfast burritos. Stop by on the weekends and enjoy sitting outdoors while listening to live music. Patio is pet friendly!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't call this place friendly. As a matter of fact they were straight up snobs. Maybe because I had just finished riding my bike and I didn't come in fully made up!?  And the girl at the counter also had no idea what coffees were brewed. Disappointed...."}
{"text":"Village Coffee is a genuine neighborhood coffee shop. We've been coming for over a year and it always satisfies us. Their coffee selections are flavorful, off the beaten path and served plenty hot! The pastries are the perfect accompaniment and if I weren't a semi obsessive calorie counter, I'd probably get one of each! Live music outside on weekends is a very nice touch too. Drop in, you'll leave smiling."}
{"text":"Not only is it the best coffee in town, but the staff rocks. Awesome vibe, and will definitely be in my constant rotation."}
{"text":"This place may have the best espresso in town. It is a darker roast and is incredibly smooth. The espresso shot was pulled just right: no burnt after taste and a perfect creme. The toddy was also amazing. It's a dark toddy and is not so watered down like other places that attempt it.   Based on coffee alone this place easily gets 5 stars. I am not so sure about the food. I'll give it a whirl next time. Service was nothing special but when you are just ordering coffee you would have to go out of your way to give bad service.   I'll be sure to return soon to update y'all!"}
{"text":"I have finally found a place that puts Starbuck's to shame!  Let me tell you how long I have been looking for an alternative to a regular coffee shop that is in Scottsdale and serves better drinks than Starbucks.  I think the reason I love this place so much is the alternative drink options:  my personal favorite is the Almond Milk Chai Latte.  Yes that is right a latte not made from cows milk, but almonds instead.  It is creamy and delicious!  I get mine with a shot of espresso added.  The quiche is fantastic as well.  I am in love with the Asparagus cheese freshly baked in the morning."}
{"text":"Friendly, very good breakfast burrito, great WiFi, comfortable to work.  I'm a Starbucks fan, but, when in Scottsdale - Village Coffee is it!"}
{"text":"Pros:  - best smooth DECAF drip coffee I've ever tasted (included milk/milk substitute/sweetener).   - 3 sugar-free SAUCES (in addition to SF syrup choices) these sugar free choices are rare at coffee shops. - intimate, cozy, unique coffee-shop feel. no bright lights - pastries good & unique, has a crustless quiche.  Tasty eggs and bacon. Though coffee is main attraction.  Cons: - depending on the day and number of customers inside, it can get pretty loud. - animal allergy sufferers, like myself, have issues with the close proximity of dogs to your table or chair. Living in Scottsdale you know dogs in food places is getting more common unfortunately.   - Never know when there will be a wait of 5+ people standing in front of you.  Challenge to gauge if you are in a hurry, particularly in the morning. Even with wait coffee was quick, but eggs and bacon took about 20+ minutes. - Drip coffee is reasonably priced i.e. $2.45 + tax, medium cup.  But quickly gets expensive, i.e. $4 if you add steamed milk and syrup/sauce - husband didn't care for decaf with SF syrup (sauce is undoubtedly better). I tried twice for him, second time regular coffee with hazelnut shot.  Nope, he won't convert from Coffee Bean.   I've been here maybe 15 times over the last few months, I fell in love with it the first time I went. If you know and accept the pros and cons, you'll love it.  Staff are not overly friendly yet pleasant as they work quickly to serve you. That comment is neither positive nor negative, maybe good service is more accurate. FYI if you get almond milk it can't be too hot (previous poster) soy or cows milk can be heated above almond milk temperature.  Suggestion to owner - try using fettuccini for coffee stirs ( some Canadian and Costa Rican coffee shops have changed to this earth-friendly option)"}
{"text":"I moved to Scottsdale recently... This have been going everyday for my morning coffee.  The coffee is excellent and high quality.  Love it!!"}
{"text":"Just a neighborhood haunt for me.  They have wifi, but I'm never here long enough to use it so I haven't yet asked for the mot de passe.    I get the Breve a lot, however although the cream is different, if you're wondering about your macros it has the same as a normal latte.  I just enjoy the taste a little bit better.  There is a plethora of baked goods for purchase.  The folks who work here seem to be even more morning types than even I because they're open early.  Another I like is the red-eye which is a shot of espresso and then filled with your choice of roast, one I have yet to try is the black-eye which is two shots of espresso and then fill with your choice of roast.  What takes Village over the top are the choices of full, but light breakfast options."}
{"text":"Grown-up grilled cheese. That's all you need to know about for lunch.   This place makes delicious coffee and serves it out of huge cups! I feel like I've had it all. I love walking in to the aroma. On the weekends they have live music outside and you can sit down and read a paper."}
{"text":"My favorite morning spot.  Great coffee with good service.  Nice pastries in morning.  Outside seating too.  Kudos to Leanne she knows how to brighten a morning with a great hello"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My husband and I stopped here after a pretty blah dinner at Grassroots Kitchen and Tap.  My husband got a black eye (2 shots of espresso and drip coffee,) I got a hot chai tea.  I took a sip of his coffee and it was really good!  He enjoyed it as well.  I feel like a lot of the people that say the coffee is weak here are just used to the burnt bitter garbage they get at Starbucks and don't know what real coffee should taste like!    My chai tea was fantastic.  It's probably the best chai I've ever had.  Their menu is pretty limited but if you're looking to just get a really good cup of coffee/cappuccino/latte this is the place to go.  The girl behind the counter was also really nice.  My husband pretty much asked what every single drink on the menu was and she answered all of his questions with a smile, and was happy to give my husband 2% milk for his coffee since he doesn't like half and half or skim which is what they had out.  It's also really nice to support a local business instead of a huge corporation."}
{"text":"What's a working girl gotta do to get her morning Cup o' Joe? I'm talking about just a regular cup of drip coffee--I don't need anything fancy in the mornings (although, I do enjoy my espresso-based drinks as well, don't get me wrong here).  Well, this place has got it! From light-roasts, to dark-roasts, to decaf, to toddies.  Pros: Local, nice variety of coffees and drinks, upbeat environment, yummy pastries, pretty decent food, nice staff, and quick service  Cons: I'm not a huge fan of their espresso-based drinks (lattes, mochas, etc.), unfortunately. Coffees and pastries (most specifically the blueberry scones) are the highlight of this shop for me.  My recommendation: I usually get a regular drip coffee with a splash of almond milk and a shot of the caramel syrup in my cup. The combo always goes well with the medium-dark roast that they prepare for the day! On a particularly hot day (which is most days in AZ), I'll get the iced-toddy (espresso beans brewed in cold water). I think I might like Cartel Coffee Lab's iced toddy better, but this does the trick!  Also, I think they do make a good iced chai/dirty chai as well. I like them here, and I don't usually prefer chai lattes when I go to coffee shops.  Overall, I wouldn't drive out of my way JUST to try the food/coffee here. But, if you're in the area, Village Coffee Roastery is definitely a great place to stop by to grab a snack and re-fill your coffee cup for the day."}
{"text":"I'm upping this to a strong 4 stars.  Not cheap, but consistently Great coffee, expertly made espresso and americano drinks with the crema just right!  I don't know what happened but the chicks that work there are pleasant, effiicient, and a breath of fresh air.  I luv finding local businesses that I want to support and will be back on a more regular basis..."}
{"text":"I come here a lot. Like pretty much daily a lot. It's getting weird. Why you ask? I'm not a huge fan of chains. The espresso is great. They roast the beans in-house. They display local art. The people watching is fun. The patio is shaded and dog-friendly. The employees and owner are friendly, some might even say charming. No seriously, ask Lisa, the owner. She'll tell you she's charming.   Between my house and place of work there are at least 20 different options for coffee. The usual suspects: Starbucks, Coffee Bean, some local jobs, and even a strangely placed Dunkin Donuts. I go in the wrong direction every morning to go here though. They're fast. Even faster now that I have a pattern of ordering. The latte is usually waiting on the bar for me by the time my card gets processed.   And that, my friends, is why I have become the Duchess of this fine establishment and lived happily ever after in the Land of (soy) Milk and Honey.   (ok, that last part is a touch dramatic, but seriously, it's good here. Go.)"}
{"text":"Best coffee in AZ. Roasted perfectly for the most flavor and smooth taste. Craig did a great job here, I think the new owner learned from Craig. I have never had better coffee. Just fantastic."}
{"text":"Stopped by and realized I'd walked into a real coffee place. Not Starbucks or some place with a big machine, but actual real roaster with a Seattle/Portland, or even So Cal coffee-snob feel and atmosphere! There's unique art and photography for sale and on the walls of the Village Roastery.   My first trip I order a Large iced, non fat latte to test out their coffee. Perfectly done...no burning or over-roasting detected. I tried a shot of espresso, also the same day. Second trip was equally great. Third trip the guy's already asking, \"do you want your usual?\". I switched it up and went with a hot drink for a change of pace.   Every trip was consistent and excellent. I really like the ambiance and I LOVE their coffee!"}
{"text":"This place has become a pit stop for me on my way to work. Such a charming  little local coffee shop that also displays artwork from local artists. The quality of their coffee surpasses the coffee you get at Starbucks! They roast their bean in house and the flavor is outstanding. Seriously this coffee is like crack and my most productive side emerges once I drink this coffee. I have yet to try their food but couple of their regular customers have told me that it is delicious. Yeah, I talk to strangers at coffee shops but what can I say? This coffee also makes me super social!! Go try it!!!!"}
{"text":"I try to come here every morning since it's down the street and Brittany always takes care or me!! Love supporting local businesses. The vibe is nice and the coffee is excellent! I always try to tell people to come here because in my opinion it's better than starbucks especially price wise."}
{"text":"The espresso is SO smooth! I ordered the iced soy latte to give it a try and it didn't need anything added to it-it was perfect. I liked it so much I went back the next day, even though it's totally out of my way, just because it was that good! The baristas are also really friendly, which seems rare nowadays. They had live music playing when I was there on Sunday, which was cool. Prices are solid, I think it was either 4.25 or 4.75 for my soy latte, which is definitely fair for how deliciously amazing it was. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best lattes/caps in Scottsdale.   The staff is extremely friendly.   They remember my order and it is practically ready by the time I am at the register.  A fantastic place to relax in the mornings.  Love love love this place."}
{"text":"For what it's worth it's ok, good on them to display local art an they had someone singing outside for money which was nice too... So why not 5 stars ? The coffee was good but just not like lux or lola good. Sure in scottsdale its leagues above the tarbucks  or the like. I just did not think of it as exceptional.   If I'm in the area I'll def come back here I'm just not driving 20 miles for it like I've done for lux or Lola"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I stopped by here randomly to grab coffee while we waited for our turn at Butters Pancake & Cafe. We got a mocha with three shots and it was quite excellent- both the taste and the foam art. The cafe has abundant seating both inside and some out and local art for you to admire while you wait for your food/drink. Next time, I'm going to order some breakfast foods. Their bagels looked delicious!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the Blueberry Oat Bar - extremely delicious!!  4 stars for the customer service - despite a long line, it went very quick and staff was friendly. 3 stars for the chai latte - it was luke warm and I didn't really like the taste of it, despite the fact that I LOVE chai teas elsewhere.    Based on other reviews (and that delicious oat bar!) will be back to try other options."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee shops - delicious sandwiches, nice atmosphere, and even a tea drinker like me can tell that they take their coffee v seriously.  They use Dilmah tea, a really nice brand.  The open-faced salmon breakfast sandwich features really nice salmon, plenty of capers, fresh tomatoes, onions and the perfect amount of cream cheese. I've had it many times and the quality never flags. Whenever I get brave and order something different, it's tasty.  The service is always pleasant and they  have stevia."}
{"text":"Best coffee house in town!  I love coffee and I love this place!  Great service, excellent coffee, and a wonderful atmosphere.  Everybody knows me by my name and treat me like family.  Oh and they have excellent food as well!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, great bake goods and nice atmosphere. Very reasonably priced.  Home bake good taste. Great WiFi. Close access to green belt."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, hand tamp espresso machine, and friendly service what could be better ?"}
{"text":"Awesome coffee and breakfast. They have a great system for reoccurring costumers and the vibe is awesome. Some days you can listen to live music on the patio or just enjoy the awesome vibes and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hands down THE BEST coffee in town. Lisa, the owner, (the coolest chick in Scottsdale) is committed to putting out the best, and most diverse selection of coffee from around the world, and is truly passionate about her work. She can tell you about every coffee she has in her store, including the notes, flavors, nuances, etc. What more can you ask for?   I'll tell you. Free wi-fi? They have it. Comfy chairs? Got those too. Displays of local artists selling their photography, and art on the wall? Yep. And she picks legitimately talented artists to display in her shop.  Also, for those of us really addicted to her coffee, she'll mail you coffee to WHEREVER you may be, FPO/APO addresses included. Good coffee is a must even in inhospitable environments. ;)   Thanks Lisa for giving me the greatest cup of coffee ever!"}
{"text":"wow! waiting on a table for Butters, my buddy and i just peeked in here. in smelled so good, we had to order a coffee.   i ordered a red eye....a shot of espresso. then you take that shot, walk to the coffee stand near the door, and fill er up. holy cow...it was delicious. very strong, but not bitter strong. smooth and delicate, but not weak. i sucked that thing right on down.   it must be good....the place was packed in and out. the patio is shaded and dog friendly!"}
{"text":"This is like a hidden gem in scottsdale. Hip, cool coffee spot. Kind of small but there are spots to hang out. I enjoyed this place. Better coffee than starcrap, I mean Starbucks."}
{"text":"Purely on the espresso... not good.  I did not have anything else."}
{"text":"Average coffee at best. Refills are 50 cents for drip so a medium with refill around $3. Got a bagel with it but they charged another 75 cents for a few pats of butter. Really? Hate places that nickel and dime their customers."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite coffee spot. Glad I found it. Not only is the coffee cheaper than Starbucks and other chains, it's so much better tasting!! Also, the rooster breakfast burrito is killer! I want one now! Can't wait to wake up and hit this place up again. Really nice staff too and a cool little place to hangout. A large latte is under $4."}
{"text":"The place has a variety of food and coffees.  There is outdoor seating. Enjoyed a large cinnamon roll and good strong coffee."}
{"text":"\"Best.Latte.Ever\" , said Taylor Swift... well that's what she would've said if she had been to Village Coffee Roastery.   I've traveled the globe and have had my fair share of coffees. Weekday mornings, you might as well find me hooked up to a coffee IV at my desk! But in all seriousness, these baristas sure can make a great coffee... and better than your other big chains.   My go-to is a soy latte - plain and simple. My boyfriend has a more cumbersome order and without fail they always come out piping hot with velvety, delectable foam! Mmm! They have a pretty good selection of baked goods, breakfast burritos and sandwiches.  Customer service is awesome, pretty much like cheers - everyone knows your name (after you've been a patron a few times).   If you live or work in the area, definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"Loved this coffee shop! I used to never go to coffee shops but I've been into trying new ones lately, and I'm glad that I gave the village roastery a try! For starters, they are open from 6-6 which is awesome. Was later in the day when my latte craving hit, and I was happy to find that this place I wanted to try was open past 4!  It was pretty easy to find, right near Butters, one of my favorite breakfast joints. There weren't too many people there when I went, lots of parking and it was low key there which was awesome.  The guy working the counter was cool, didn't make me feel rushed or anything, which sometimes I get due to my indecisiveness and taking way too long to order haha.  I was happy to see all of the options and also the food menu looked good! Healthy stuff and some yummy sounding breakfast burritos. The snacks they had on display looked delish. Also I thought it was great they had options for soy, almond, or coconut milk. That's a wide variety in terms of dairy free milk substitutes! I went with an almond milk latte, and asked about the flavored syrups. Ended up getting pumpkin spice because despite triple digit weather, I want it to be fall. It tasted great, my PSL craving was certainly satisfied. I got mine iced and one thing that was great was that they didn't use too much ice. Always sucks when you get a drink like that and it's 90% ice haha. So the ice to latte ratio was perfect! Next time I come here I definitely have to try a baked good, and bring a coffee or tea lover along to show them this gem!"}
{"text":"I came here last weekend while waiting for a table at the breakfast place around the corner. The coffee was excellent and my wife enjoyed her iced tea drink. The atmosphere is intimate and it seems like it would be a great place for a date. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Easily the best coffee in the valley. This is one of the things my wife and I look forward to on the weekends. In fact our Friday nights end with the question of 'best coffee in the world tomorrow morning?'   They are artists at this shop with all things coffee including a little latte art as well. The only real negative about the place isn't even their fault, because no one has found a way to get some of those Scottsdale women from bathing in terrible perfume.   If you're going to spend $10 at Starbucks do yourself a favor and go here instead. Support a local business and have better coffee in the process."}
{"text":"Cozy and charming. Great coffee and good food with a limited menu. Seating is limited but they have a patio and when we were there on a Saturday they had a guitarist. Patio is dog friendly. The service was friendly even though it was busy."}
{"text":"stopped by with the husband, and he ordered a hazelnut latte....  basically, my standard with which i judge all coffee shops.   uhm. 5 stars. rich coffee taste, and none of that burnt acrid taste that many places tend to have with their espresso. definitely a fan of their lattes!   It's unfortunate that their patio can get crowded with smokers who choke up the breathing space at their entrance."}
{"text":"I love my coffee and know where to go in every part of town, this way I can avoid Starbucks. I much rather promote and give my money to a local establishment that takes pride in it's product. I can say without a doubt that Village Coffee Roastery is the best coffee in all of Phoenix, and possibly Arizona. Do yourself a favor and try their coffee. Their food is really great too."}
{"text":"When I am in the Gainey Ranch area this is my go to coffee spot.  I am a bit of an espresso snob and let me tell you there is no lack of creama here!  Amazing espresso!   They also have a reward program where you can earn a free drink!"}
{"text":"Perfect espresso, breadless breakfast, and ambience. Great way to start my Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"My test for coffee places is a cup of their drip and this place has you back track to the door to fill your own from a thermos. Yuck. The coffee was just ok. Hubby got a mocha that was better than starbucks, but thats not a big deal really. The breakfast burrito was gross. More than all of this the vibe was bad. The cashier was spacey and gave no receipt. The barista was loud and unfriendly. Some live \"music\" was going on out front at ear splitting levels. Probably wont be back."}
{"text":"My espresso was good but the Flat White was not really a Flat White. Generally if you order a Flat White and they say \"so a Latte?\", that's not a good sign. That held true today. Since I don't make Flat Whites, only drink them (excessively) I cannot say what they did wrong. It just wasn't the right texture for the foam and the coffee flavor wasn't pronounced enough. Almost like it needed more of an espresso type roast."}
{"text":"With 80+ check-ins here, it's safe to say I love this place.  It has all of the right ingredients of a great coffee house. Friendly staff, eclectic decor, comfy seating spaces, and a great menu.  My go-to here is the dirty chai (drinking one right meow).  They stir up all of the iced latte drinks before they pour them so the consistency is extra creamy.  Most of the food is made in-house, along with their muffins.  Seriously - no better way to be greeted in the morning than by a tray of muffins hot out of the oven.  If you live in the neighborhood, don't forget to sign up for their loyalty program.  For every 10 drinks, you get one free.  You'd be surprised how quickly they accumulate.  Love you guys, keep doing what you're doing!"}
{"text":"I met D.D. here for coffee this morning... what a treat!  Obviously, the company was what I went for, but I was really pleased with the entire experience... I entered to a warm and cozy atmosphere and D.D. (who arrived before me) was saving a seat for me in a ridiculously comfy chair.  Not only that, but she treated me to a perfectly concocted, just the right temperature, medium soy latte.  There was a good flow of people coming in and out while we sat and chatted, but it wasn't distracting at all.  I saw several people working on their laptops, and I noticed that the employees were smiling and that there was a variety of breakfast items to choose from as well.  It's a little bit out of my way, but a pleasant place to go to grab a cup of coffee and read, work, or do whatever it is that makes you happy... I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"As my husband and I walked in I had every excuse in the book why I didn't want to betray my coffee shop....but as I walked into this dark and friendly atmosphere I suddenly wanted to try everything!!!   I gave the waitress full control of my taste buds. Boy, did she hook us up.....!   The chicken soup was to die for and the village sandwich..... Let's just say I can eat that again for lunch tomorrow.   Ok, ok, ok let's talk coffee!!! It was( I hate to say it) it was very good.... No horrible after taste but a smooth like silk taste.  The smell was heavenly...No I'm not turning my back on my favorite coffee shop but I'm sure they wouldn't mind sharing the spot light."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everyone's so nice and everything is delicious :) Reasonably priced, especially for large lattes... why go to Starbucks when you can eat and drink local?"}
{"text":"Never again! I had a few minutes for lunch. My sandwich was BURNT from there mini press not even grilled! My Chai was awful and the girls forgot the shot. Maybe if I was a man in a suit I would have gotten better service. Starbucks smokes this place!"}
{"text":"I like the vibe here. Coffee shops are popping up all over the valley and it seems like Phoenicians are starting to use them as unofficial offices. I saw plenty of laptops set up looking like they are there for the long haul and people having meetings. There's definitely plenty of outlets to charge all the electronics.  This place is filled with the smell of good coffee, they also serve breakfast & lunch items.  Seems like there are quite a few regulars here too."}
{"text":"Quaint coffee joint, my iced latte' was fine, but the barista BANGING metal to metal to dislodge the grinds, gets old very quickly.  There is a better way to do that, and one more conducive to a relaxing environment."}
{"text":"On my days off, I like to take the time to grab a cup of coffee so I can run my errands extra efficiently.   I ordered the medium mocha, and while they had very friendly service and even created some pretty latte art, I'm never a big fan of coffee shops that sell drip coffee sitting in  large metallic canisters all day long.  The coffee itself was okay, but nothing that would push me towards making an 'out of the way' drive to get it.   If you know the difference between coffee that's made via chemex, cleaver, pour, etc. then make the drive over to Press Coffee...it's more expensive, but you'll taste the difference."}
{"text":"Love it! Such a great neighborhood place with great coffee and breakfast! The staff is so nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Waiting for a table at Butters we popped in here to grab a coffee.  The place was nice and clean, but small and packed so it felt very cramped and like you were running people over to get to the counter.  The coffee was okay - not bad, not exceptional.  The staff was very nice and the appearance of the coffee was excellent.    Likelihood of returning?  75%  Perhaps if there is another long wait for Butters (which is delicious) we'll pop in again and maybe next go round we will sit outside and enjoy the live musician if they are there again!    Give them a go if you like mom and pop feel coffee shops, but know going in that you may have to fight for a seat, and the place is small-ish."}
{"text":"The prices may have been rated differently than Starbucks, but they are pretty similar when you retrieve your item total.  I walk into the coffee shop and greeted quickly by the cashier.  It was my first time coming to the place because I was in need of coffee. I had a little trouble with the menu deciding on what to order. So I ask her what would be good or what she would recommend.   I ended up asking her what was similar to a caramel macchiato and she suggested a vanilla hazelnut macchiato. I ordered a large and the price was very related to the venti iced latte from Starbucks but the cup seemed to be smaller than Starbucks.   With all the comparison aside, my iced latte was very good.   Customer service was also very, very, good. I would come back but maybe if Starbucks isn't open. :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff have always been very friendly. I really appreciate that they have a bulletin board for local businesses to post their info. This is a great place to work, to promote my cleaning business, to have meetings, or to just catch up with a good friend. I often find myself driving 10 miles out if the way just to go here over a commercialized coffee place! Oh and the coffee is always made perfectly!"}
{"text":"These folks are sincere and friendly. I stop in when I have appointments in the area and upon each visit I'm impressed. For one, the coffee is delicious (Americano) and the food is good with a great selection. This place has everything you need; if you'd like  to relax on some comfortable furniture or if you're there to pull out your computer and get things done. I think the shelf, a few inches above the tables and just a few inches wide is ingenious, it's just great for getting things up and out of the way. I pulled out my Nikon D800 and took a few shots here that I'll post."}
{"text":"What a great place...in a great location...with truly one of the great (if not the greatest) coffee roasts in the valley.  While located in the fairly swanky Scottsdale Mercado complex, as soon as you open the door you feel like you're in one of those cosmopolitan/bohemian shops in San Francisco, Settle or New York.  I guess that can be an awful thing when the execution feels forced or fake, but the 'vibe' here is authentic, and the quality of the coffee (and diverse menu of espresso drinks) bears out the authenticity of this shop.  I'd also highly recommend the sandwiches, which can range from 3 stars to 4.5 stars (BLT), but lets face it, you're going there for the coffee.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Finally-  great coffee I'd repeat! A roaster in Phoenix that has taste. Coming from the NW the palette is particular.  I traveled 30 minutes to get here and try...I would repeat. Nice 'breadless' breakfast, super fast and cappuccino great flavor, could use a bit smoother foam... but it 'stuck' around in the cup! Getting online was easy too. Good people watching and energy.   Cheers"}
{"text":"Hard to believe but this is my first cup of coffee in 24 years, but it's true. And what a great experience. I was intoxicated by the smell as I went by and decided that I wanted one. I had a mocha made with chocolate hazelnut milk over ice, which is dairy free. I loved it.  The selection they had was amazing, like Vietnamese and Brazilian coffees. I obviously don't know much about the different kinds of coffees but it was worth every sip. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Adore this little hidden gem. It's a given while waiting in line got Butter's but after you experience you wonder, Butter's what? lol great knowledgeable staff. You can just get coffee or tea to go or order drinks and breakfast and enjoy acoustic tunes outdoors, on the weekend. Dog friendly outdoors as well. Great breakfast burritos and great green tea. Not Starbucks, but that's ok!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't overly impressed with my skinny latte. Espresso was on the weak side and the service was slower than I anticipate to receive from a coffee shop."}
{"text":"I've been going here at least once a week; typically on a weekend. I really love the laid-back, neighborhood atmosphere. It's a really great way for me to wake up on my lazy weekend and get out before it becomes frighteningly hot. My fave is the iced latte. I just love the roasted flavor and how refreshing it is; especially, during the summer desert heat. It tastes so much better than a few other places I've frequented. The cinnamon rolls are also a stand-out. I have no idea how fresh they are, but they seem to be baked fairly recently, probably from a bakery near by. The frosting appears to be cream cheese, which I greatly appreciate. It makes it rich and flavorful without being too sugary. One other thing: they do have free WiFi here. The other \"one other thing\" I'd like to mention is the mutant memory ability of the girl who works behind the counter. Holy *#?@!!! How the heck does she remember my name with my once a week visits???"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and this was one of my top 4 Coffee houses in Scottsdale  It has fallen from grace no difference between a latte and a cappuccino  Barista starts off with a quart of milk steams it up and dumps into several cups Quality is now comparable to Mc Donald's  To bad"}
{"text":"I rate the coffee at the Village Coffee Roastery as the best I have tasted in all my travels! The Owner and staff are very friendly, knowledgeable, and experts in the preparation of \"expresso\" coffee drinks.  I personally prefer their Latte's, which in my opinion, are second to none.  The only other coffee house that I have found that compares with the quality of the coffee at the Village Coffee Roastery is the Cherry Street Coffee House in Seattle, Washington. Unfortunately my primary residence is in California and I have not found anything to compare with the Village Coffee Roastery.  In addition to their coffee, their quiches, baked goods and \"special\" lunch sandwiches are excellent.....Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"I really liked their latte. I have not tried other than latte but I can tell that they use a good coffee bean. However I did not like the smell that was coming from the shop. Somehow it smelled funky. I will be back to try some more."}
{"text":"Absolutely adore this shop! The coffee is incredible and the staff are very friendly and answer any questions with enthusiasm. It is always a joy to pop in for a quick coffee or spend the afternoon reading here. Love their iced coffee, but really there is nothing less then amazing on their menu."}
{"text":"Take my general dislike of animals and add a little OCD to the mix.  Then ask me what happens when you walk into the local coffee shop and see three dogs.  One sitting in a chair that customers have to sit in, one on top of the coffee table that customers have to but their food on and the final 150-lbs Great Dane that I watched lick the shoulder of an unsuspecting women seated in a chair.  Well, its time to call some people out and ask the business owner what part of the AZ Health Code they don't understand.    Listen, I understand that we are living in a time in which everyone thinks they can do whatever they want, whenever they want because they are individuals and having general rules in society somehow take their civil rights away from them, but really, 150-lbs dog in a tiny coffee shop without one employee saying, \"hey, outside with the dog.\"    I remember the days growing up as a kid when I would pet the dog or two chained outside the doors of the grocery store or ice cream store.  Today, I can just reach over to the counter where the food is served and pet the them, while the employee behind the counter, having to wear a hair net, doesn't say a word.    The bonus to my morning was when the Great Dane's owner plopped down right in the middle of the outdoor patio, next to where I was sitting, and I got to watch a giant line of drool flap around the dog's mouth until it almost hit the ground.  But right before it did, the dog turned his head and it landed on the table next to where we were sitting.  Awesome!  Next time your food drops onto a table, think about this story before popping it in your mouth.    Oh buy the way, the coffee and assorted drinks are excellent, as are all of their food items.  So, if you can take a little doggy DNA in your food, try the place out, it's quite good.  I would normally give it 5 stars if not for the Wildlife Zoo theme they have doing on inside with all the canines."}
{"text":"They roast their own beans.  I like non acidic coffee and they have it...smooth medium roast and an acidic lighter roast for those who like it."}
{"text":"Best coffee shop in this area! Friendly staff, good food (even the PBJ sandwich is outstanding) and nice atmosphere. Whether you're just looking to relax with a cup of joe or get some work done it's a great spot!"}
{"text":"Great place to do work and enjoy a delicious drink! I am not a big coffee drinker, but I thoroughly enjoy the coffee and tea drinks served here. I got a cold brewed decaf drink and it was fabulous as-is, without sweetener or cream.  I also had a tea that was equally delicious. The employees are very friendly and it's a nice quiet spot in the afternoon to get work done. They also serve breakfast items and sandwiches."}
{"text":"I ordered a machiotto type deal like starbucks does and Village Coffee tasted way better than Starbucks. They serve food in there as well. It's a great little place to sit down and surf the web if you have the time. It wasn't a loud place at all like some Starbucks are. I only got a coffee drink, but it was fabulous. The only criticism I would give is that it did not have a drive thru which I'm pretty sure why most Starbucks do so well. Being in Scottsdale, this place I would see in downtown Phoenix if anything. Great Drink!"}
{"text":"What a lovely discovery. Had planned breakfast meeting at Butters next door, but a 20 minute wait changed those plans, ended up at Village Coffee Roastery instead. Never been and now a place I must return to. First and foremost, the people working the counter were super friendly and helpful, a nice change from the chain coffee places in my neighborhood. My cappuccino was better than what I normally get at the neighborhood chain coffee houses, and that alone is worth the return trip. Liked the somewhat eclectic vibe of the place with the mismatched chairs and artwork. Has a nice outdoor seating area, that is probably fabulous in our cooler months. Definitely will be back to try out the food and relax with a good cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Gulp, yum. Gulp yum. Can I leave it at that? Being from the NYC area, I miss solid coffee and this is it locally. We had espresso and a coffee. Both hot and perfectly rich. Nice, calm quiet coffeehouse feel. Right in the heart of Scottsdale! They serve a small menu, which we will get to but we checked out their breakfast plates and it seems just homemade fresh everything in this place!"}
{"text":"I love Village Coffee Roastery! I only wish it was closer to home so I could go more often! Despite this, I've been several times, usually in the morning. They roast their own beans, the employees are super friendly and everything from food to drinks is delicious! I've had their breakfast burrito (delicious!), some of their muffins (pumpkin was amazing) and their hot/iced lattes.   On the weekends they get really busy and have a live musician playing out front where you can sit and enjoy. Despite being super busy, they still get your food/drinks prepared quickly and with a smile. I've never had a bad experience here and this coffee spot is in my rotation. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am a coffee bean girl - anyone who knows me knows I have a serious addiction... But at the urging of a good girlfriends husband who is a fan of this coffee shop insisted I check it out!  Service was great and their lattes were as good if not better than some of their name brand competitors. They also have a good selection of baked good and sandwiches. It is def on my rotation for coffee stops! It's also super cool that they roast their own coffee beans daily!"}
{"text":"First time here, and I loved the interior as well as the friendly staff. I ordered a bagel and iced tea, and though I've had better of both, the price, service & staff stood out much more. I definitely will be returning now and again before work!"}
{"text":"My favorite coffee  spot! It's like cheers here everyone knows your name a drink order! The service it top notch and their coffee is the best in town. Kirk, Lisa and Brittany and so friendly and always make me feel like family when I come in! If you haven't been here and are looking for a great coffee, espresso or snack please check them out!!!"}
{"text":"Cool ambience, but my husband and I did not like our coffees.  He got a Mocha and I got a Cappuccino with a shot of caramel.  Mine was okay, but it lacked depth.  I felt a little rushed to order even though they weren't busy.  I wish we just got coffee at Butters."}
{"text":"Excellent espresso! I'm a fan of espresso on ice and this place is the place to go in Phoenix/Scottsdale for just that. I'm visiting from Texas and this keeps up with the great coffee in Austin."}
{"text":"What a great cup of coffee!  All I had was a medium black Americano, and two thoughts swirled through my head: 1.  This is good coffee. 2.  why do we put up with corporate chain coffee shops when there really are so many wonderful little places like this?  Village Coffee Roastery is a nice little place to hang out and enjoy a cup or two.  There's a huge variety of creative espresso drinks along with the standards on any coffee shop menu.  Village also offers up some breakfast and lunch eats if you're hungry.  Don't be scared off by the upscale vibe of the shopping plaza Village Coffee Roastery is located in.  There's no pretentiousness here.  It's simply a nice little coffee shop."}
{"text":"The best espresso drinks I have had in Arizona. Wifi, benches, a healthy menu, and friendly service make this place my favorite java destination. I offset my iced mocha with Greek salad. If you're a panini fan, try the Ciao Down. Although, I may ask them not to toast it in the future. Located in Scottsdale with indoor and outdoor seating; they cater to professionals getting together for the casual meeting while making my 4 year old feel just as welcome. He was entertained last week watching them roast their beans in house. Come in and check it out. Don't forget to take a look at the art on the wall done by local painters and photographers and find out while closing the bathroom door is optional."}
{"text":"Great espresso, not too bitter,  nice froth on the top. I had an Americano and a straight up double shot. The barista dude does an excellent job knocking them out. I sat at the bar and enjoyed my coffee and the show. I also tried the banana bread and a chocolate chip cookie. Both were good. This was my first visit. I'll be going back. I think if I can tweak my Americano a bit, it will be perfection. I also look forward to trying some of the other food on the menu."}
{"text":"I remember coming to this coffee shop every now and then when I was younger (I honestly don't know why because I didn't spend a lot of time in this area) and liking it quite a bit.   I randomly stopped in after a doctor's appt. and loved it more than I remember. In fact, it's only about a half a mile from a doctor's office I go to regularly (and have been for a while) & I'm a little annoyed I forgot about this place the whole time.  Anyway, I stopped in with my mom. I got a delicious caramel latte & some sort of blueberry oat bar, which was YUMMY! The right amount of blueberry to oats, and everything tasted so fresh! I also tasted a piece of my mom's banana bread, and it was great as well.   The staff here is very friendly and it's a really cut set-up. There's a small patio, and a a good amount of tables and chairs inside. In addition, there's a small bar area in the back by the espresso machine with seating. There's also an area up front with couches and cushy chairs around a large table. This is where I sat w/my mom and we randomly struck up a conversation with some friendly people.   I'm glad I rediscovered this place. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Unlike most nearby places the coffee was great and the prices were far from extortionist. Also sampled the hot chocolate which was great when paired with one of their delicious homemade cookies.   Service was quick on a busy Sunday not much else to say they do coffee quick and good."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite coffee shop at the moment, when visiting the Phoenix area. I spend a lot of time in this part of Scottsdale and I'm always looking for a good place to have coffee and get things done.  The coffee is decent and there are a lot of high-quality, somewhat novel, food choices. The wifi always seems to work and it's fine to sit for a while. There is plenty of free parking."}
{"text":"Best iced coffee and cranberry muffin in scottsdale. Enjoyed my iced coffee to the very last drop."}
{"text":"Only had a drip coffee but it was far better than most drip coffee you get elsewhere.   Nice outdoor space and good wi fi."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I use to go here in the mornings to get their ice chai's before work. The food here is terrific too, but a bit too pricey. Dogs are welcome in the shop and on the patio. This is a hub for business professionals! The staff is terrific as well!"}
{"text":"I do not live near Village but when I am in the area, I make sure I come in here for coffee. I love that they have different milk substitutes because i cannot have milk and everything is fresh!   They know what they are doing there and they are always attentive to what you are wanting. Even if you are not sure, they will make it a point to get you what you are in the mood for."}
{"text":"I love this place and go every morning.  I moved here two months ago and I was driving to the Starbuck's for a month before trying this place.  Within two days, they recognized me and knew what I wanted.  I love their crustless quiches, muffins, oatmeal.......My nonfat cappuccino is great."}
{"text":"I travel around the world and I am constantly searching for independent coffee houses. This is far and away the best place I have ever been. Especially if you are a regular, there is truly a family waiting to accept you here.      I judge a good coffee house by it's mocha and this place has the best ones out there, I prefer the hot to iced but either is a winner. My wife loves the chai latte here, every one of my friends that I have taken to the store now considers it the place for their coffee fix.    Most of the staff are friendly and welcoming. The owner Lisa is not only one of the smartest baristas out there. She has a science to her roasting process unlike most other places and has even said that her coffee receives some of the top awards in the world. I believe it.     If your dragging a little and want a one of a kind experience, ask for the John Wayne;)"}
{"text":"Best chai tea! If your looking for a place to relax and get some work done, I highly recommend visiting the village coffee roastery!!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday and the food was okay and they messed up my breakfast sandwich (wrong bagel and wrong meat). Gave it another chance today bc it's so close to my apartment and I REALLY wanted to like it. I definitely regret that decision. Put in an order to go this AM and was quoted with a 20 minute wait to pick it up. Got there a few minutes after the 20 minute mark and ended up waiting another *45* minutes after the 20 they quoted. So it took them over 1 hour to make 2 bfast burritos, a bfast sandwich and eggs/bacon/toast. Not only that - they screwed up all 4 of them. The rooster burritos we got were literally egg and cheese - nothing else. The egg sandwiches had the wrong bagel, wrong meat and no cheese. The other breakfast was missing toast and had ONE slice of soggy bacon. I am so sad bc I had such high hopes for this place. But it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had. Finally a customer had to say - if you can't make them don't serve them. So they stopped making food after that... I have no idea how this place has such good reviews."}
{"text":"The person who took my order was super pleasant and happy to be there! That's the type of attitude that can put anyone in the right kinda mood. Couple that with a great cup of coffee, pleasant surroundings; what's not to love?   I ordered a cappuccino, 6 ounce in a stay-here cup. Solid espresso taste. Easily a place to hang out, read a book, talk with friends or get some work done. The free wi-fi (you have to obtain the code) seemed to be relatively fast.   There are several tables and plenty of comfy chairs to enjoy your stay. Fascinating wall art for sale, and of course, the roastery equipment just hanging out makes it even more authentic."}
{"text":"It's easy to understand how this coffee roastery has stayed in business so long. It's all about quality. Quality coffee roast, quality service and quality food. The atmosphere is relaxing unless you find yourself being sized up by a neighborhood regular."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible! Came in for latte and decided to try a burrito. The rooster is hands down the best burrito EVER!!! Highly recommend. The coffee was perfect!! Perfect roast, no bitterness, no burnt taste. Just perfect morning made possible by these beautiful ladies!"}
{"text":"My Americano was way better than starbucks ........ and its next to TCBY yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool I can't say enough good things.  I don't come to Scottsdale as often as I used to, but I needed to sit down, fill out some paperwork and have a cup of coffee before I went into an interview at the crack of dawn this morning.  I stumbled upon this place completely by accident, and it was one of the better coffee shops I've been to in these parts.  For starters, even on a weekday at 7:30 in the morning, this place was packed! There was a group of bikers (pedal bikes not motor bikes) that had just come in from an early ride all sitting outside drinking coffee and hanging out.  The inside was full of people doing what they needed to do, all professional looking. Clearly, this is the place to be!  I went with an iced coffee and a slice of banana bread to hold my stomach down while I quickly filled out some paperwork.  The staff was friendly and courteous. Despite being busy, my drink and food were ready in a jiffy.  I didn't hear them call my drink order, but the girl realized when I poked my head up from the table that I must have been looking for the coffee she just poured.    Place is nicely decorated, and has a full menu of items.  Pricing is decent, and there's plenty of places to sit, indoors and out.  Bathrooms were clean and ready to use, and overall a positive experience. I think they also have free wifi! Check this place out if your in the area...."}
{"text":"My gf drags me in here. I don't drink coffee often. Seems like a nice place. She likes their lattes. The barista is cute. Not much else to say."}
{"text":"Love local coffee shops. Especially when they have great atmosphere, breakfast options and various fresh blends. Village Coffee Roasters met my expectations."}
{"text":"Nice place for coffee.  Apart from their quality (which would be enough to draw people anyway), they are also next to Butters.  This enables them to sell coffee to folks waiting on Saturday and Sunday morning for a seat at one of the best breakfast joints in the Valley.  Although the Roastery would no doubt prefer that people eat their food (and they do appear to have a substantial menu of items beyond the requisite pastries), I'm sure they in no way resent the spillover.    If you do decide to eat here on Sunday morning, at least you won't get the 30 minute wait for a seat.  Meal or coffee, either way, you're probably going to be pleased with your choice.  The live music is another plus."}
{"text":"OK, I didn't want to have to do this, but there are some idiots who don't have brains to blow out, though they should try (was that too harsh?)  I lived the last 4 years in Seattle. I *KNOW* what good coffee is. In Seattle, I lived across the street from Cafe Vivace and worked a block from Cafe Vita, and walked my poodle past Stumptown. I probably drank enough coffee to kill a herd of hipster buffalo during that time, and I don't remember sleeping much. My point: I'VE GOT COFFEE CRED.  I've tried some other indie coffee joints around, but the Village Coffee Roastery makes THE BEST in AZ. in my not-so-humble opinion.   The service is GREAT, the place is clean. I haven't eaten any of the baked stuff or sandwiches, so I can't vouch for that. Seems other people I observed like it well enough. But, that's all just window-dressing to the main attraction : COFFEE.   So if you are expecting Mc.Crappy coffee or StarCrap's coffee, you may be disappointed because your tastebuds are on ass-backwards.   But, if your mouth is not paralyzed and you know what good coffee actually is and tastes like, then you will love this place.   Just tell Kent I sent you, and he'll serve you up just right."}
{"text":"Never noticed this place before, but walked in there the other morning for a quick coffee, while in the neighborhood.  The place was so cute and quaint.  I was hoping to like it.  Service was friendly.  Now, on the down side.  They toasted my bagel without asking, and I prefer plain.  Assumed it would be that way, unless I requested otherwise.  Besides, isn't it their job to ask which we want?  I ordered it with cream cheese in hopes, that since they serve full breakfast, they would have spread it on for me. I dislike getting the cheap little packet of cream cheese and having to spread it on myself on a take out order for the car.  They also used some lousy, cheap no name cream cheese which was tasteless.  Then they throw the bagel lose into the brown paper bag without a styrofoam container or plastic wrap.  Then I tasted the coffee, with great anticipation since they are a \"world famous\" coffee house, and couldn't have been more disappointed.  I am not even a big coffee drinker and don't necessarily want it strong, but this one was like drinking water.  Totally flavorless.  And my personal pet peeve is when there is no Sweet'n Low option.  I do not like the other sweeteners, but that's just me.  Oh yes, one more dislike, they charge .75 cents to add butter to your bagel.  I know they are not alone, but is that not the biggest rip off of all time?  And I would suspect, like the cream cheese packet, that they would have tossed in one little gold foiled butter pat that costs them .3 cents, if that.  I am adding 1 star more than I should, because the place was cute and the server was friendly."}
{"text":"Great little coffee place! The drinks are always spot-on and you can tell by the way they taste that they: A(use high quality beans, and B(Know how to pull a shot correctly. They also have tasty sandwiches-my personal favorite is the Caprese because the pesto sauce is awesome and you can't go wrong with mozzarella cheese. However, I did give 4 and not 5 stars because they used to serve their sandwiches on a baguette which I was always down for, but have recently switched to panini style. This would be fine (I mean, who am I to resist a great panini?) but the temperature of the mozzarella comes out in limbo between warm and cold and the contrast is a little...unpleasant. The ingredients are still of great quality though.  Also, I would not recommend Village Roastery for studying as they keep the lights pretty dim inside and there are not many outlets available to use a laptop. I've read other reviewers remark that it is too noisy, but honestly that has never been an issue for me, even while studying. If you are looking for a quick, gourmet lunch paired with a velvety, luxurious mocha, definitely stop by Village Coffee Roastery!"}
{"text":"Worst dump and pour Cap I've had in along time do yourself a favor and drive to Cartel or Press if you want it done right every time. Left it on the counter and drove to Press coffee"}
{"text":"After putting our name down at Butters for an hour and a half wait, we spotted Village Coffee next door.  We opted for a couple of breakfast specials: ham, eggs and toast, along with a latte.  I have to say it was the best coffee I have had, ever!  Unfortunately, I live in California and the morning commute for coffee just might be a little too much!  I'd be at Village Coffee every day if I lived in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've been hearing great things about the Village Roastery for years and decided to finally come in today!  Love the atmosphere, music, and ambiance. It's all very homey and comfortable. I didn't know exactly what I wanted, and the barista was kind enough to work with my mom and me in making out decision. We got 2 small lattes and opted for mugs instead of cups. Because the mugs were smaller, they only charged us for Americanos, which are over $1 cheaper. Customer service for the win!  Our lattes were INCREDIBLE! The espresso was perfectly bold, but not bitter. Definitely one of the best lattes I've ever had.   I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a cool little coffee joint! Now, I was a little hesitant to go in here with all the bicycle guys wearing tights like they're riding in the Tour de France. It was like one of those Harley bars (In that they were a group of guys hanging out with 2 wheeled vehicles), but these guys pack themselves into tight marketing gear. Once I got beyond the Lance Armstrong wannabees you enter a cool atmosphere with acoustic guitar, local art, and the aromas of fresh roasted coffee beans and baked goods. Staff was point on and very attentive. Added to my list of top coffee shops in greater Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The thing I dig most about this place is the atmosphere. There was someone playing acoustic guitar up front that added to the vibe. I had a chai tea which was delicious. Definitely a find."}
{"text":"I have to say, I'm pretty surprised that this place isn't rated a little better. I thoroughly expected it to be a 4 - 5 star place with a ton of reviews. (of course, it is in a fairly sleepy shopping center)  While my experience here has been limited to scattered mornings in which i'm playing hooky from work, I really wish it was closer to home and I could be more of a regular. Their drip coffee is good, and the iced americano i got this morning was great. I can't speak to the rest of their drinks.   Food-wise, I've only ever had the quiche and the occasional cookie... both amazing. I would try a breakfast sandwich, but honestly, I never get past the quiche. It's just always so good. They always have a good selection of flavors (cherry tomatoes and basil, red peppers & feta, spinach, etc.) and they're always delish. The one thing i will say is I wish their menu was a little better explained. Maybe they have printed take-out menus that I haven't seen that offer more explanation, but there's a fair number of \"named\" sandwiches that give you absolutely no clue as to what's on them. And for a guy that's both a) adverse to asking questions, and b) wants to avoid being the guy that holds up the entire line.... this is a hurdle. (also, while everyone I've dealt with is perfectly nice,  for some reason I do always get the feeling that everyone in there is part of one big in-the-know \"clique\" and i'm the visiting outsider. Maybe they just get a super high number of regulars?)  All in all, i'm still perfectly content to jump off the 101 a few stops early every now and again, enjoy a great cup of coffee and a fantastic breakfast, and get a nice start to the day."}
{"text":"I had the \"Hammy\" sandwich and an iced Breve (a latte, but with half and half instead of milk!) with caramel. The sandwich was very good and made fresh to order. It came with a little side salad, but it wasn't really noteworthy. The Breve was very good and creamer tasting than a regular latte without being too heavy. My boyfriend got a mocha Breve, which I preferred to the caramel one I got. If I'm in the area for brunch, I'll stop by again!"}
{"text":"I come for the Incredible Peaberry Brewed Coffee and Cranberry Scones! Unique coffee blends daily to break up the monotony and a relaxing patio to start a relaxing morning right. I recommend becoming a regular here to find a new coffee you like!  McCormick Ranch Favorite -4.95"}
{"text":"Quaint little eclectic place. Furnished kinda like the \"Friends\" TV show.   Friendly service in the name of Sam. Also has outdoor seating. Serving breakfast and lunch. My hubby and I split the Wicked Tuna sandwich with a side salad. Excellent!!! What flavor! Next time we're up this way, we will definitely stop again."}
{"text":"This is my go-to local coffee shop. Their coffee is unbelievable, they roast it in-house. Their baked goods should not be passed up and are made fresh daily. On top of that, the staff is so friendly! They often remember my name and my order. Check out this local gem!"}
{"text":"Great location! Nice staff. Great coffee! Clean and fresh decor.  I like the nearby coffee shop for breakfast burritos, but never was impressed with the coffee:( hope they do ok:/"}
{"text":"Although this coffee shop is in an outdoor mall with minimal parking close by, it is worth walking a short distance to enjoy this spot. Maybe you'll get lucky and find a parking space right outside but expect a short walk.  Inside the ambience is laid-back hipster. Or maybe work meets casual with a hint of allure. There are two large blue coffee roasters that dominate one side of the coffeehouse. The walls are well covered with interesting artwork.  The coffee is flavorful and the taste of my latte is one of coffee beans then milk so one can experience the rich smooth elixir as it glides down your throat.  People watching here is a pastime you could easily engage in as there are people coming and going all the time."}
{"text":"Love this place! The coffee is great, the baristas are all friendly and they all know my drink. Even when busy, they still make drinks very fast. Great service! I frequent many coffee shops and while some May view this place as pricey, to me it's cheaper than many other shops I've been to and definitely cheaper than Starbucks."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local coffe shops , been coming here for years.   Always smells intoxicatingly of roasted coffee and bacon.  Friendly staff, quick service and absolutely great coffee!  Plus a great quite location"}
{"text":"Get the quiche! It's to die for! Really, everything I've tried there is great. Cute atmosphere and the employees are friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"This place is cute!  I've come here a few times on the weekends, and have never had a bad experience.  I will say, it's nothing out of the ordinary.  No magic coffee or special food that puts it above and beyond the competition...but no complaints either!  I DID try their BLTA (bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado) sandwich, and it was heavenly. Would definitely order it again.  They have a nice patio are where you can bring your dogs and sit and read the paper, or chat with friends.  Pretty cool place!"}
{"text":"This place was easy to work in, friendly staff, with good food and coffee. Parking was easy and there was plenty of seating and outlets. Very comfy. The wifi was good and the music wasn't too loud. It did get pretty loud during the lunch rush, but nothing too bad. I was really impressed with the staff."}
{"text":"Not a coffee drinker but hubby is. They had a wide variety of different exotic coffees. Service was great. People were really nice. A cool hipster vibe. Their lox bagel was amazing. They pile on the ingredients so it was hard to eat but I enjoyed every bite of it. I liked the tomatoes and cucumbers it was a nice touch."}
{"text":"What can I say but this place knows coffee very very well... I frequent at many coffee shops in the  valley and I'm a coffee connoisseur. This place has a very good espresso machine. Most of the time my lattes are made perfect. Sometime if they have a new employee making my drink I can tell they need a little more practice. It does take practice perfecting the art of making perfect lattes."}
{"text":"The almond milk latte is the best I ever had, best I ever had, best I ever had, I said it's the f**king best.  Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make up on, that's when it's the tastiest, I hope it don't take that wrong.  But in all seriousness, it's fantastic - strong without being bitter, creamy without inducing a weight gain epidemic (I'm glaring at you, Starbucks), and it sure as hell wakes me up enough to put on real clothes instead of wearing sweat pants all day."}
{"text":"I'm literally still sitting in Village Coffee writing this because this is the best hot chai I've ever had."}
{"text":"Let's just start here.  Hello, they actually offer decaf ICED coffee.  You have any idea how much of a struggle this is for me?  Everywhere I go, I get \"well, no, but we can make a decaf iced Americano\" and it NEVER EVER works out, it just never tastes very good.  So I called ahead since my wife and I are traveling to Phoenix/Scottsdale for vacation to ask about iced decaf and got a YES answer.  So when I got here they were true to their word.  Had one iced decaf and one iced regular and both tasted GREAT.  And the staff were great and I loved the ambiance and the big roaster.  They offer lots of options for beans and styles.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I thought my mocha was very good.  However, I used the bathroom and there was no toliet paper with the dispenser hanging on the wall by a thread.  Also, whoever the worker was that came in last Sunday to roast beans, he did not wash his hands but started handling everything behind the counter.  A little updating to the decor would not hurt either."}
{"text":"I too along with others have been delightfully surprised at how great this coffee shop is.  Let me just say this, I don't think it is a coincidence that today I parked next to a car from Seattle.  I usually get the Americano which is great, and I too agree it blows Starbucks away.  This shop is located near my work so I always find time to stop in."}
{"text":"I went here this morning after mehkfast at Butters to fulfill my coffee needs and as part of the Coffee Tour of PHX!!! It was a bit busy, but we didn't have to wait long for our lattes. I like the atmosphere in the coffee house but found the lady singing outside was a bit annoying... and their pastries looked pretty good....but I didn't eat one (self control FTW!). The coffee reminded me of Cartel a bit, it was strong without being too strong. The latte was well made. I would come here again if I were in the neighborhood, but there are equally good or better coffee houses that are more convenient for me."}
{"text":"There is one sandwich I go here for, and it's one I crave when it's been awhile: The Cuban. It's loaded with ham, cheese, and pickles. One time they didn't have ham and made it with bacon for me. Do you understand how delicious that was? Do you?  I also get my beans here. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and the bean selection is awesome. I get the espresso. This place is always busy, but there's never a long wait for the food. I love the staff, too!"}
{"text":"This place has by far the best eclectic coffee. Love coming here with friends or by myself to just chill. Today with Brittany."}
{"text":"Okay, so at first I loved this place. me and my husband would ride our bikes here just for coffee and to sit outdoors.  I forget the barista's name, but he wears glasses, and sports the 5 o'clock shadow, he works days only. He makes the best latte's, mocha's etc. Good creamy foam. This place reminds me of a place in Seattle called Espresso Vivace.   So onto why I give 1 star. Well my use to be favorite barista I just described picked his nose then got my bagel with his bare hands ready to spread cream cheese on it.  OH HELL NAW, I DON'T PLAY THAT SHIT.  First of all, wash those hands and put some plastic gloves on. Sicko... I'd rather pass on eating boogers."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have only been there twice but their lox bagel is AMAZING and the best price around, their espresso is super good as well and their staff is very friendly although I haven't actually eaten there or been there for a long time, I for sure plan on coming back more often!"}
{"text":"Just love this coffee shop. It was unexpected since we were in the area and needed a quick caffeine fix. Hubby ordered croissant breakfast sandwich and it was big enough to share. Nothing special but we did enjoy it very much. He also enjoyed their drip coffee while I had my regular latte. When I took my first sip, I didn't expect anything, but I couldn't believe how good it was. It was perfect sweetness with no bitter coffee taste nor had any after taste. I am not picky by all means, but they know how to do coffee. I will stop by every time I'm in this area."}
{"text":"Best drip coffee on tap in the Valley that I've had.  They roast their own beans right there in the tiny location and keep it simple - ususally just 3 or 4 varietals available.  Bagels are above average and hit the spot with the large soup-bowl sized coffee when dining here.   Limited seating though, irregular roasting schedule and irregular availability of beans.  Barrista drinks aren't anything to write home about, and they have very limited hours and parking is often bad.  So it's a hate/love situation for me.  Beans to go, and maybe a drip coffee to go - fine."}
{"text":"Quaint and quiet location and delicious coffee!  Great local coffee lounge or \"pick up and go.\"  Owner is amazing"}
{"text":"Best place to get coffee and eats in Scottsdale -- they have a very friendly staff and a great menu of healthy options and fresh baked goods.  The wifi is always great and the environment is very relaxing."}
{"text":"REALLY good coffee..... one of the better almond milk lattes I've had (outside of Portland, Or ;)   ) Really cute coffee shop inside, there is some nice seating areas for lounging.    They also have quite a few menu choices, I had the breakfast burrito. It wasn't too bad, I do wish it had a bit more green chili as I could not taste it at all. They were very accommodating for my dairy allergy. Service was good, Tho I feel they could have been a little bit more peppy or friendly, but considering the area.....it was decent.   I can't say I'd come back for the food or service exactly, but I would definitely stop in for more coffee.....and that's a good thing if you are a coffee shop! (btw, they also had an excellent selection of teas for you non-coffee drinkers)"}
