{"text":"Loved this place for breakfast! Really delicious. Good size portions and flavorful!
The staff was so kind. They even brought out the pancakes for our toddler first, since they could see he was becoming antsy."}
{"text":"Our go to breakfast joint every Saturday and Sunday! Sometimes a Monday too! Amazing food and lovely family run independent cafe"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Staff is super friendly and helpful. I had an Iced Green Ginger Tea. It was delicious. Comfortable booths, it's a great place to get some writing done. Food looked and smelled amazing. Will definitely come back to try the food!"}
{"text":"If you are in the dufferin groove area and looking for a place for brunch this is the place to go! It is a nice sized cafe with lots of booths. The service was wonderful! They asked me three times if I would like more coffee in my already massive cup. The food was delicious with very large servings and very reasonably priced! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The eggs Benedict were flawless and every ingredient could be tasted, even the strawberries served on the side.

The avocado, goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes and eggplant were a breath of fresh air from eating meat all the time.

Nice atmosphere. Had to wait for our food a little bit, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Great all day brunch/ breakfast! The presentation is lovely with fresh fruits and yummy salads served with their omelettes. The staff and owner are friendly and attentive and the space is open and warm (without the lines ups :)

Great value - would definitely recommend if you haven't been."}
{"text":"This is the perfect breakfast place. It's relaxed, and totally unpretentious. The service was prompt and friendly, and the food delicious. Everything was very fresh and flavourful, they obviously care about the quality of their food. Great fresh bread and home-made hot sauce. Good size portions at a fair price. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  I had the Canadian omelette.  Serving sizes were big and great prices.  Loved the house made bread.  Healthy and fresh!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Don't get where the good reviews are coming from. But I have long learned most people cannot tell good breakfast from bad. I had a very disappointing experience. Although the staff was pleasant and the atmosphere was nice, the food was underwhelming. The taste of my Eggs Medaline (smoked salmon Bennie) was bland, my homefries were cold, not even a bit warm. My friend's beans came way after she was done with her eggs, what was the point of bringing them at all? We also ordered french toast to split for dessert and they brought it at the same time as the eggs. Why in the world would you do that without asking? The french toast was obviously too cold to enjoy it by the time we got to it and the home made bread they used for it was way too dense - this restaurant clearly does not know what french toast is supposed to taste and feel like. I really wanted to like this place, but I just can't. How do you mess up something so simple and basic as breakfast?! I wont be back that's for sure."}
{"text":"Loved it. Stopped in for lupper on a Saturday afternoon around 4pm. They had a brunch menu and a regular menu going.

We had the smoked salmon salad (salmon, oranges, avocado...), eggs Canadiana (benny-inspired thing with mushrooms, ch√®vre, sun-dried tomatoes), yam frites (baked instead of fried?), and some mixed juices.

What really impressed me was how consistent everything was despite the fact that the place has only been open for 4 days. I couldn't point to a single dish or side that wasn't really solid, from the mixed juice to the tiny and perfectly crispy homefries. The attention to detail is apparent, everything was plated really nicely and the food was bang on. Really fair prices too, I wasn't expecting this level of polish and quality from $10ish brunch mains.

It's a bit of a curious place - I can't put my finger on what they're aiming for with the menu; their current hours are 6am-6pm in spite of some pretty dinner-y menu items; and they've inherited Kubata's unfortunate small, dark, front windows which fail to show off the inviting shabby chic interior, and which sometimes make it hard to tell if the place is open.

But when a 4-day-old restaurant can deliver an experience like this, something's working."}
{"text":"My go-to cafe, both for a tasty americano and a delicious all-day breakfast (the Full Aziza) or lunch. The sandwich is amazing on its own but if you want even more, the house-made hot sauce adds another layer of flavour and a nice kick (not too much kick, just the right amount).

The baked goods are always yummy and they often have a healthy twist."}
{"text":"Honestly one of my favourite places. The food is just so good every single time. ORDER THE HOT SAUCE IF YOU GO!!
I ordered eggs benny after a really cute younger waitress took my order. It took a little bit but oh my god it was worth it. Their coffee is definitly on the same level as starbucks. Not surprised as to why it was busy, yet as it was busy they still kept bringing me water and checking up on me. The owner even cracked up a few jokes here and there  and the food tasted so fresh. Theres very few restaurants you can go to now a days where you get incredibly tasty fresh food and a welcoming environment. Shoutouts to their decour too. 

Last time i went i wanted to bring home some hot sauce and the owner told me they sell it in a large container for like 5 bucks and i thought he was joking but they arent and you know where my next $5 are going lol"}
{"text":"A friend of mine first brought me to Aziza saying it was really fairly priced for really delicious food. I've been back many times since and the food is always great. Friendly service, good price, and their homemade hot sauce is crazy delish.

I'm pretty sick of brunch spots that are all atmosphere with so-so food that's pricey, and my friends and I have been looking for a spot like Aziza for a while. It's great that they do breakfast all week, too. Everyone I've brought has loved it.

Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"my favourite place for brunch! SUCH nice servers, great owners and very talented chef! huge portions, fresh ingredients, they even make this beautiful pink chili hot sauce in house. eggs portuguese are to die for! delicious elevated home cooking."}
{"text":"Attention to every detail!
Even the jam is homemade and scrumptious.
I had the coconut tea and a BLT, which had a bit of spice in the mayo- my mouth is alive!
Kind servers with smiles.
Loved this cafe, we'll be back."}
{"text":"We go here for breakfast all the time!  All the breakfast sandwiches are amazing and for lunch  you have to try the chicken, avocado and brie sandwich.  The home made hot sauce is out of this world!! You'll want to eat it with a spoon."}
{"text":"We popped into this place because we could not find another place that we were looking for, the service was SLOW as molasses and the soup was less than average however the sandwich was fresh and as yummy as it gets.   
What a pleasant surprise.  Will defiantly go back if I am in the area."}
{"text":"What a find.

In the midst of Toronto's wallet-draining tapas craze (\"Here's one cracker! Share it amongst yourselves!\"), Aziza is the kind of restaurant that I wish would duplicate all over the city. Great value, nourishing food, amazing juices, friendly service, and-- what a relief!-- ample portion sizes.

Recommended for anyone who likes a leisurely meal that feels like you're in someone's home."}
{"text":"Always delicious and freshly made food . Healthy and homely . Would highly recommend it . Everyone is very friendly and they appreciate your business which a lot a places in Toronto don't !! Looking forward to my next visit . ."}
{"text":"I decided to try this Cafe because I live close by. I am so disappointed. It took a half an hour before someone came to take our order, we waited over an hour for our breakfast which was not even what we ordered and generic and in the time span of all of this our server didn't even come over to apologize for the wait or to even fill up our water glasses. I will not be returning to this Cafe, what a terrible experience."}
{"text":"The food here tastes great. I've only visited twice since moving down the street, but both times have been exceptional. The service is not super fast, but that's ok. I enjoyed my downtime from a busy day while waiting for my food.

I ordered the chicken brie avocado sandwich with mushroom soup. It was pretty amazing. I love supporting the little guys, and Aziza has made the list for me to return in the future."}
{"text":"I checked out this place for lunch with my brother a few days ago. We had both worked out at the Y nearby and were STARVING so we decided to try it and I was really pleased !

The choices were super healthy which was great considering that we had just spent the morning working out at the gym. We both tried the avocado, brie and chicken sandwiches with spinach and mandarin side salad. The food was great and the family that owns this place was really personable and friendly.

We were a little hesitant right off the bat as the first waitress waited quite awhile to come by with menus but it was definitely worth the wait and the prices were definitely reasonable for what what we got.

Check this place out if you get a chance! Try the juice bar if you get a chance as well. I decided against it at the time but my brother tried it and said it was great.

Very impressed with the service overall despite the little shaky start, will go back again!"}
{"text":"We had salads for lunch.  Mine was with eggplant, bermuda onions and goat's cheese - so beautifully presented,  it was hard to take the first bite. It was delicious

My husband had the spinach salad which had strawberries, orange and pecans. He loved it.

The service was wonderful and friendly.  The atmosphere sublime.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Wholesome, nourishing food. Highly recommend for travelers looking for a quality meal."}
{"text":"Great space to hang out in. Food was stellar. Service was relaxed. They let me stick around longer to work on a Saturday afternoon without a hint of concern. Fantastic addition to the neighbourhood. Try the BLT and ask for roasted potatoes. Great value at $8.95. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"We came here for weekend Brunch - we waited outside for 20 Minutes for our table, waited for another 15 minutes for the waiter to take our order and we waited for another hour for our omelette and egg Benedict.  I did not get the omelette that I ordered, and my husband's egg Benedict has no hollandaise sauce, so what is the point?  To be fair, they apologized and gave us a big discount.  But no money is going to buy the time we spent waiting.. their kitchen is not equipped to serve a full room of customers.  So go there during weekday non rush orders,  but stay away from weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"This place is a new favourite for me and my boyfriend. I've been here twice now and each time, the food and service have been outstanding. The staff seems to really appreciate the business and it is evident by how kind and courteous they are to their patrons. I hope to see this place flourish."}
{"text":"All the places in my favorite neighbourhood were closed so while doing the laundry I wanted a bite for lunch, I try to eat mindfully, organic with health in mind.  I am a very good cook who values quality food and quality ingredients. The menu was not enticing and the selections were not creative and left me lamenting that I sat down but I thought I might order a veggie sandwich, I asked the waiter about the bread and the said \"a loaf of homemade whole wheat\". When the order arrived it was so gross, it was cream cheese and underripe tomatoes and thick red onion on a crudely made pita. I said to the server \"You said it was a homemade loaf of bread\" and they said, \"yup this is it\"I nicely let them know I did not want to eat this as the quality was sub-par and not what I was told I was getting. They then charged me for something I did not eat and I threw it away and left.
This place is good for college kids with no cooking skills, or food quality knowledge."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of being introduced to Aziza earlier today by a friend who has been raving about this place all summer.

I have to say the experience was quite good. It is run by a couple who seems to be fairly passionate about their cute little breakfast/lunch place.

I was warned that the service can be a bit slow but as the place wasn't too busy today, we got our food in a decent time. I guess weekends get packed and at that point, you have to just deal with waiting for your fair turn. ;)

The menu has a breakfast side and a lunch side. Options seem to be fairly standard for a place like this but there are plenty of options and an ever so slight Portuguese touch to some options.

We all had different omelettes and everyone at the table was happy. What I particularly like was that on top of our eggs, we got a leafy/berry salad, homemade bread, perfectly done potatoes, and the highlight of sides in my option... Perfectly prepared lentils! 

Although I didn't have tea or coffee, they have a very very extensive Tea selection that the owner told me was developed by some master tea connoisseur.

I will definitely return to place again and am more than happy to recommend it to you all!"}
{"text":"The Canadian eggs benny were perfection. Beans, like I've never had them done, along with crispy potato, and pomegranate sprinkled spinach made my day. Had a sunny and relaxed brunch here, which I hope to relive again :)"}
{"text":"Cute little homey space close to my workplace. I stopped in here for a bite to eat after work and it was a nice experience. The owner served me and she is very lovely and pleasant. The sandwich and fruit smoothie hit the spot nicely - thanks again!"}
{"text":"Lord Jesus. I feel awful writing this but holy shit. I think the owner has her daughter waitressing. She's maybe 16? She's literally ruining their business. I was there with a friend, there were about 5 other tables. EVERY SINGLE table was frustrated. No water, no silverware, smoothies came after the food AND they're disgusting, huge thick undrinkable if you get coconut milk in it. Asked for hot sauce literally 6 times. Friend ordered bread w her food when we first placed the ordered, we had to ask 3 more times for it and when it did arrive it was garlic bread, very strange to assume someone wants garlic bread if they ask for toast. 

Waited 50 mins for food and 25 for cheque. Sandwich was coated in goat cheese which isn't a good cheese to overdo it with. Salmon salad is so good but they have to ditch the orange slices. I can tell the lady that owns this place is trying her best which is why I gave it two stars but it's unbearable in there and I'd only get that salad as take-out now."}
{"text":"Every time the food has been delicious and the staff have been extremely accommodating. They also have a homemade hot sauce that is out of this world."}
{"text":"Been here a few times on weekdays and it's been awesome, but the weekend service is super disappointing. Waiting upwards of 50 mins for eggs with little to no acknowledgment from wait staff is kind of brutal. 

Eventually we were informed that the kitchen was slammed due to being backed up on online orders, and to their credit they offered an apology and a 50% discount for waiting. The busyness is understandable but I feel it's kind of irresponsible on the restaurant's part to opt into online delivery if they can't maintain service for walk-in customers. 

4 stars strictly for the food - it's been consistently good, but I'm only ever coming back on weekdays/off peak times."}
{"text":"I went on a recommendation and it did not disappoint.
The good: they bake their bread for their sandwiches and I think it's made fresh daily. Homemade hot sauce in varying degrees of spiciness. Tea from the house of tea on Yonge street. So very good quality tea 

The bad: the veggie curry I had a lot of zucchini but not too many other vegetables.

We had a western sandwich spinach in lieu of ham, steak sandwich and vegetable curry. Plus 3 types of tea.
Everyone enjoyed the meal. I liked the blandness of the curry. It was quite mild but the hot sauces gave leeway to up the ante as much as you like. I can see my kid eating the curry cause it's not hot. And I liked it more spiced up. So all could be accommodated.
I think I'd have to try it again to give 4 stars cause I had the curry and I would of liked more variety of vegetables."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast today for the first time--found this place through a random internet search.

And WOW.

Fresh fruit, homemade bread, homemade hot sauce, lentils, great coffee and great service--I'm impressed. Everything was excellent, and a total surprise.


I'll be back--and will be highly recommending Aziza in the mean time. Good food, and really good vibes here."}
{"text":"Love it here. The owner/chef is super nice, her partner is a great guy too, the food is great. I love the raspberry dressing they have and the chicken avocado brie sandwich."}
{"text":"This place opened in the old Kubata spot and in the interest of trying new things in the neighbourhood, stopped in for brunch a couple weeks back.

The menu is made up of some classic egg/meat/potato plates, omelettes, lunch friendly sandwiches, and baked goods which sit on display at the front counter and appear to be baked in house.

To summarize based on my experience: 
-very fresh food! Everything seemed made fresh to order, but with that be prepared to wait for it (we waited at least a half hour for our breakfast although it seems like timing was not on our side as there were 2 tables ahead of us who were seated and ordered, and only 1 person in the kitchen)

-cool points for fair trade coffee, but failure points for the fact it wasn't actually very good tasting.

2 breakfasts, an orange juice and a coffee = around $26 after tax, before tip. Seems like a fair price and choice to make if you're not in a rush, might just have to ask for something other than the standard house coffee next time."}
{"text":"Completed my annual visit to Aziza and the food definitely? did not disappoint.? I ordered the cheese and bacon omelette, which came with potatoes, super tasty lentils, yummy bread and some greens. I ate the omelette with gusto, and really appreciated the lentils - I actually ventured out and mixed it in with my omelette - which all amounted to a great food experience.

The reason for the 1 less star, was the service. It was not as stellar as it was for my first visit. While the young lady was very sweet, she just seemed to be a bit all over the place, which may have been attributed to her either being new, or having a large number of tables to wait on, although it wasn't really busy. 

Still, the food was excellent - 5 stars. I will probably visit again next year!"}
{"text":"LOVED it! 
The food was so delicious! I ordered the aziza ultimate breakfast and...WOW! The service was good and super friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots! Cozy atmosphere and great food. Everything is made in house from scratch. Worth checking out"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to my favourite breakfast place :( 
Used to love it here but this time everything was so disappointing. I ordered fresh OJ but what I got had chunks of banana in it and made me wonder if they accidentally made me a smoothie or if they didn't clean the remnants of a banana smoothie out of the blender/juicer beforehand. When the food finally came after waiting just shy of 40 minutes, my omelette, usually a pretty fair size was, looked like it was made of a single egg, and was completely raw in the inside. The breakfasts usually come with baked beans, this time the beans must have been spooned out of their soup of the day because my home fries were sitting in a pool of broth with pieces of tomato skins. The home fries are usually spiced well and delicious but this time they were pretty burnt, and tasted like old fryer oil. My boyfriend loves the bread because they bake it there but this bread was more like stale rye bread, hard as a rock. We're both pretty bummed out because Aziza is our usual breakfast spot, the last time we tried to get breakfast, the restaurant was more full than usual and everyone was sitting with menus as the one waitress flailed about, we went unnoticed and decided we were better off elsewhere. I'm thinking that going elsewhere might unfortunately be a permanent solution."}
{"text":"We stopped here twice while in town on vacation. It was so good we had to come back. We had the mango tango and pink drink smoothies on the first trip. Both were fresh and tasty, the perfect amount of sweetness. My partner liked the mango tango so much that we came back the next day and he got it again! I got a grilled cheese that time - it had a nice mix of cheeses and was on good quality bread. The people who work here are also exceptionally kind and friendly. Great ambiance as well."}
{"text":"Had an amazing brunch with my boyfriend this morning. Great service, Perfect portions, the lentils were amazing. Everything tasted great 
It was our first time there and won't be our last."}
{"text":"Lovely place...food was scrumptious and generous portions.
Bathrooms were very clean, and the servers were excellent!

Will be back with my family members for sure!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I have been twice in one week!  We never tried this before but found the food delicious and the service great, especially the male server (sorry I don't know his name).   The eggs florentine were delicious. my daughter loved the eggs canadien.   Great tea selection."}
{"text":"We were in town for a long weekend and we were looking for a breakfast when we drove past this wonderful small restaurant. We were staying downtown and most of the other places were impossible to even get in without an hour wait or more. The food and service was great. Each breakfast plate had something we didn't expect. Both egg dishes had fresh fruit, a small salad with pomegranate seeds (yes, salad on breakfast plate), black beans and home fries. We had one order of pancakes for our daughter which came with fruit.These things were more than garnish and made each meal exceed our expectations. The Eggs Benedict came on home made toasted bread. One order was the Eggs Portuguese with Chorizo. We also one regular with ham and Hollandaise sauce. The eggs were perfectly cooked.

The service was attentive and polite. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is honestly the best breakfast spot of all time. The food is just perfect- it's fresh, light, made with love and full of flavour (generous portions too!). Most things are homemade, like the bread and the hot sauce.

THE HOT SAUCE... is out of this world- come just to try it. 

Anyways, I've put off this review because I'm selfish and like having this amazing spot all to myself, but the staff is so wonderful that this place really deserves to be packed all the time.

Yum, yum and yum!"}
{"text":"I will 100%  go back and try every single thing on their menu! I had the chorizo Benedict and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch for the first time. It's a very quaint and charming spot. I had the spinach eggs benny which comes with fruit, salad and curry lentils and homemade bread...delicious and very generous portion for the price. The server was wonderful and kept our water and coffee topped up. Great place for tea fiends too, over 60 varieties."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good breakfast place in Toronto. My girlfriend found Azisa. It was a pleasant experience from start to finish. The menu has a great selection. I highly recommend the Greek omelette it comes with an amazing home made bread. We also had pancakes which are home made as well. The majority of the menu items are home made as they should be. Not what I'm use to so that's a plus. Our server was really nice and familiar with the menu. The restroom/washroom was so clean and nice. I would most definitely come back to Azisa."}
{"text":"Fav spot for brunch in the west end. Perfectly seasoned lentils and potatoes and they make their own onion hot sauce!!"}
{"text":"Brunch on Sunday morning. Nice staff and owner, even when it got really busy around lunchtime. Excellent freshly prepared plate with eggs, lentils, potatoes, very nice salad and fruit. Good selection of teas. Nice atmosphere. Very reasonable prices. Tea got refilled several times. Personally i did leave however when some families with young children arrived because it got too busy and loud for me  so a good place to bring your family."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! The food is very delicious and the portions are generous. Staff comes around often to refill your coffee. All meals are served the homemade hot sauce. Free wifi! The staff seem to enjoy working there and extremely friendly. I would have definitely recommend. Order the Portuguese BENNY!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a hidden gem !! 

The owner is treats you to an immersive platter of goodness! Whether it is the savory plate my Love ordered (over sized with generous portions, even with the more expensive ingredients) , or if it was heaven's divine appointment manifesting as a plate of the most delicious plate of layered chocolate pancakes half layered , with raspberry syrup and topped with fresh sliced bananas. 

Treat and love yourself... take time to find Aziza!!"}
