{"text":"Excellent breakfast during our stay in Montreal. Food was excellent, and service was very friendly. Thank you."}
{"text":"The ambiance was great. It's close from my work near downtown. The food is healthy and the prices are average. The service was professional and very courteous. 
I had a quesadilla with a salad. Just the right amount of food.
Definitely going back again."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp we found this nice little gem near the Bell Centre. We just had breakfast and I have 2 daughters who are usually picky and fussy. They enjoyed the atmosphere, and really enjoyed the food as I did as well. This is going to be one of my preferred spots from now on.

{"text":"Service is very friendly and I really like the big spacious dinning area. But the food is very bland. Not much taste at all."}
{"text":"I hope I caught this place on an unusually bad day.  
We arrived for breakfast about 9:30 in the morning, and the place was only about 25 percent full.  We were struck by the fact that most of the unoccupied tables had not been cleared.  We should have heeded that warning sign and walked out right then.  After being seated for at least 15 minutes, we still had not been waited on so my boyfriend went up to the counter and placed our order with the waitress, who was apologetic and friendly.  Thirty minutes later, we still did not have our breakfast.  We did not even have our drinks.  At that point, we abandoned hope and left.
For the reasons I stated above, I originally gave this restaurant only one star.  Shortly after I posted however, I was contacted by the owner with an apology.  She clearly cares.  I will give this place another chance next time I visit."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this place. They made my simple eggs, sausage, and potatoes taste delicious. My husband had fruit crepes (which he says were awesome).  Service was friendly and fast. Great brunch!"}
{"text":"Best crepes Iv had so far. I been to all the other top rated crepe spots.  I just wondered in here because it was close to my hotel. I was very pleased and crepes were best yet."}
{"text":"Great service. The lady who greeted me was so kind and made sure I got my meal quickly. I was in a rush to make it to a concert near by."}
{"text":"I had breakfast there while staying at the holiday inn across the street. I thought the quality was great, service great and great price. I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Small little caf√© in the heart of the university downtown area. Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Had a good breakfast here and it was right next door to our hotel. One waitress, one cook and a pretty good crowd but service and food was surprisingly tasty and efficient. The potatoes were a real stand out."}
{"text":"Thought we should try a local spot instead of Starbucks or Cora's for a change.  This cafe was a short walk from our hotel. 

We ordered a coffee and a cappuccino.  Both were good.  Ham and cheese omelette and veggie and swiss cheese omelette.  Both were freshly made and the veggie omelette had a generous portion of grilled red peppers, zucchini, onions, and basil leaves.  They both came with hash brown potatoes, a slice of toast with jam, and a small fruit cup.

Service was friendly.  It took awhile for the food to arrive even though the place was quiet and that's the only area that could be improved upon.

Would come back the next time I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Stopped there for lunch during vacation. 

Place is nice and simple. Very extensive lunch menu, most of the selections are $6.99, plus cappuccino/espresso can be added for $2. All dishes are served with green salad. 

All food was good, with Chicken Quiche being the best. Cappuccino was very good, served in a beautiful coffee cup.

Definitely recommended for nice and simple lunch."}
{"text":"Their menu looked much better than what my hotel had to offer so I came in for breakfast. The yogurt, fruit and granola was good, lots of other options as well for crepes and baked goods."}
{"text":"Went in for some pastries on my way to work. They didn't have anything prepared yet, which was quite disappointing. Maybe it's just me, but I didn't get a comfortable video from the place."}
{"text":"Great place for a quiet and healthy lunch - very inexpensive with good service - try the Ciabatta  Toscane ."}
{"text":"Service was rather slow. Mango smoothie was fantastic, though. Crepe was pretty good. I would go back..maybe we just caught them on a slow service day (although there was only one other table occupied)."}
{"text":"Walking around Montreal and found a spot for some sweet and savory crapes! Reasonable price and quick service."}
{"text":"Nice cafe.  Good crepes.   Good service.  Relaxing location in downtown. We would definitely come back if we were in the area.  The problem is it is not a busy place and not close to the underground areas."}
{"text":"Good Place , beautiful aura .
Food is OK , don't go there for the food but just to absorb the aura of the place"}
{"text":"Highly recommend. Quiet unassuming place attached to to YWCA. We had the spinach goat cheese and tomato crepes and the smoked salmon Benedict. Service was with a smile."}
{"text":"I rarely go to the same place more than once when I am on vacation.  This was an exception. 

I was staying at the Sheraton a couple blocks away and ended up going to Cafe Imagination 3 times in my 3 day stay! 

I went twice for lunch and had their delicious chicken quesadilla (at a very very reasonable price), and all three times topped it off with chocolate croissants.  

I even bought one for the road and snuck it through customs back into NYC for my gf.  Unfortunately, I am still getting texts from my cousin about how delicious the chocolate croissant was that I left in his car!"}
{"text":"Best place to have brunch if you are staying in the area. We ate here twice during our 4 day stay in Montreal and we will eat here again when we visit Montreal. The service is excellent, food arrived at the table pretty quickly and the chef is super sweet and nice to talk to. The food is just delicious. In addition to ordering omelettes, we tried both sweet and savory crepes and they both were soooo delicious. The restaurant is pretty big in size, so it is great for not only small families but also big parties. Highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast. Stayed at the Novotel around the corner which was convenient.  First morning in Montreal but will come back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Walked over from my hotel to this spot for brunch. Warm, friendly cozy vibe with proper cafe music that's not the radio or annoying. Great sound system too! I really appreciate cafes with proper attention to music. 

Service was friendly despite a busy morning. I didn't mind it as I wasn't rushing plus there's great music. Its nice to have \"slow food\" than the usual fast food breakfast. 

Food was perfect, just the way I imagined it would be. Cafe latte smooth and served just right. 

A great Montreal brunch spot. The Cora's franchise operators back in Markham could learn something here..."}
{"text":"I am in love with this cute Cafe. I actually came here twice and both times I enjoyed my Cafe Latte. This is hands down the best coffee I have had. The presentation was superb, as it was was served in a glass cup with a glass plate. We started our New Year breakfast here and the staff was kind enough to let us order past the closing time of 1 PM. 

It is important to note that service here is quick for Montreal standards. It is customary to let patrons review the menu before asking them what they would like to eat. I ordered the breakfast croissant which came with a little bowl of friut and my friends ordered a desert crepe and a savory salmon crepe. The croissant had the right amount of buttery flavor and with the ham and Swiss cheese it hit the spot. The crepes were nice and light and the salmon had cream cheese and capers sprinkled in. 

The next day I ordered the chicken omelette and it was amazing. If you are nearby you should stop by, but note this isn't a quick in an out, it's an enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"Nice place.
Had breakfast here.  good service. Good eggs.
I was the only person there so I cant really say much about the service.  She was nice but not overly friendly.
It was sort of expensive for what you got. The portions are pretty small."}
{"text":"A very welcoming place. Quiet, calm atmosphere. Tasty food nicely presented. A great place for breakfast or lunch, reasonable prices."}
