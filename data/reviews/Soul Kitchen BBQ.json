{"text":"Soul Kitchen BBQ gave me my first taste of Collard Greens and I'm hooked. When ever they show up, that's the one thing, for sure, that I'm going order. I have nothing to compare this against since I haven't found Collards anywhere else in my gastronomic travels in Calgary.

The brisket and pork are tasty. They don't compare with what I've had in East Texas, but then nothing I've had in Calgary comes close to that.

Service is quick and prices are reasonable. My only quibble? This is a food truck, please post your prices INCLUDING the GST like most of the other trucks in Calgary."}
{"text":"I have been to Soul Kitchen BBQ food truck twice now. You guys make DELICIOUS food. I had the brisket sandwich and hush puppies. I highly recommend this fabulous food truck. Cheers!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a hearty meal with flavourful beef, tasty fixings, and fresh bun. The smoked brisket is delicious. You can tell the beef is locally raised and naturally aged. These guys care about what they cook, and you can taste the difference."}
{"text":"Fantastic smoked meat truck with the standard selections; beef brisket, pulled pork, smoked chicken. They have a few sides including mac and cheese, collard greens, coleslaw, and potato salad.

Had the brisket sandwich ($10) which included a massive portion of meat with pickles and onions. Four sauce options to choose from;  I had the Texas hot BBQ sauce and the spicy mustard and they were excellent. The meat was smoked perfectly and tender. Fresh poppyseed bun. Love the pickles on the sandwich.

Sides are $4. I had the mac and cheese and it was a pretty hefty portion. All in all a great southern style BBQ place that's easy on the wallet. 

Kudos to the guys at the truck for very fast service. Slow service speed seems to plague Calgary food trucks. Not this place!  Check it out. They take credit/debit."}
{"text":"Such yummy BBQ!!!  This truck is definitely worth a visit if you can find it downtown.  They have awesome, flavourful pulled pork, served with coleslaw on the side. So delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow what a find!
These guys had assembled a crowd on a beautiful day in Calgary this week, and I know why!
I went for lunch, but the portion size was so big I had dinner too!
I had the pulled pork sandwich, with a side of warm potato salad and coleslaw. Best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had.
Choice of five sauces for you to choose from which just adds to a great lunch. I chose the Memphis
What a cool truck, painted by a local artist apparently
I'll be watching for them again
