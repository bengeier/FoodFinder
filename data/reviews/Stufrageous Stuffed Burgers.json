{"text":"This is a new restaurant close to my home & the food is amazing!! The staff are friendly & helpful, knowledgeable about their menu. All their burgers come in beef or chicken option. They use fresh ingredients & make their sauces homemade, like the marinara. My husband & I have been there a couple times & we've tried different burgers every time and every thing has been delicious."}
{"text":"2nd visit here. Burgers are yummy. I have not tried the chicken yet.  Burgers are not huge, but shouldn't we be watching our weight anyway... friendly service, clean appearance. Definitely  worth going a little out of the way for."}
{"text":"It's very interesting!  I had the Mac N Cheese stuffed burger! It was very filling! Very Friendly Staff!!"}
{"text":"I saw this place in the Gilbert Review inside my Arizona Newspaper and I love Burgers so I drove from San Tan Valley their today! IT WAS OUTSTANDING I have been in Arizona for about 1 1/2 years from Chicago and this had to be the best burger that I have had out here!
Place was clean, staff was friendly, food came out fast and hot, and best of all was I LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Amazing burgers , awesome shakes, and the staff is always nice. Been here so many and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This was a fun, new concept for us. The interior was contemporary and very clean. Staff was very friendly and had us try different things since it was our first time. We enjoyed the food and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We really like this place. Good flavor and cool choices to stuff in your burger. I had the mushroom, onion and Swiss cheeses burger and added a over easy egg and bacon. Next time we are in town we will definitely hit this place again."}
{"text":"Ok so this place is not busy. There are 4 of us and 3 out of 4 orders completely wrong, not sure whats going on but 1 person had there food before us and we are together....."}
{"text":"The place is nice and food is great. But then when they stare at you it so akward it like I'm eating I'm fat don't look at me see all my rolls smh. Might come back if I'm to lazy to go to In and out."}
{"text":"Been here twice but I'm sold. Had the mac & cheese chicken burger the 1st time and the BC&B hamburger the 2nd time. Both were freaking amazing!! It takes a minute to get your food because they cook everything to order but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent stuffed burgers and fries. Can also get chicken burgers and lots of options. Very nice, modern setting. Fair price, and friendly staff. Really excellent place to get a burger fix. One of the many excellent new restaurants in the Fiesta District!"}
{"text":"Delicious Burger, Fries and Cookie Dessert, however the burger was a small portion and fell apart as I ate the burger. It is cut in half when you order and it basically could have been eaten with a fork instead of the bun. 

The fries were hot and crispy, great! Sauce to dip (outrageous sauce?) so so good! Must have!

Dessert cookie was the best part! White Chocolate Macadamia Nut freshly baked cookie with two scoops ice cream and toppings was awesome! Hit the spot!"}
{"text":"We live very close to this place. The first few times we went when it had opened were phenomenal.  We loved it.  We went about a month ago and it seems like it has taken a serious turn for the worse.  

Quality just not what it was when it opened.  Not sure if it was an off night or what.  

We will try it again someday but definitely not soon.  The last time we went we got the blue cheese and bacon burger and it arrived after a very long wait and we got a mozzarella and bacon burger.  Not good.  Anyway, we are Mesa residents and soooo want GREAT businesses in the Fiesta district.  That area needs great businesses badly!  Please return to greatness!   The BC'nB used to be my favorite burger anywhere.  The fries were perfect.   What has happened?"}
{"text":"Best burger in the area. I can see this bright future of this restaurant. For sure I'll come back again soon"}
{"text":"Had the Mac N Cheese burger. The burger was decent and the fries were ok. Was hoping for fresh cut fries, not out of a bag.  Don't come here and expect Hopdoddy quality.  

Restaurant was clean and organized.  The employees seemed happy and were friendly. 

In all it delivered what advertised and  since my kids enjoy this place I will be brining them back."}
{"text":"Loved the food and fresh.  Very friendly loving the pepper jack mac and cheese bites are amazing."}
{"text":"We went to Stuffrageous tonight and as always, had an amazing meal. Our family ordered two blue cheese bacon, one Reuben, one Caprese and one BBQ stuffed burger. All were excellent.  The sweet potato fries are some of the best I've had.  We tried Tempura green beans and loved them as well.  When I need an excellent burger fix, Stuffrageous is the place! Did I mention the prices are reasonable as well? Go. Eat. Be satisfied."}
{"text":"Great burgers, southwest burger with green chiles so good. Good fries, nice interior the pepper jack macaroni & cheese bites were the best"}
{"text":"This place is a MUST! I had the Mac n cheese stuffed burger and the combination couldn't have been better. The outrageous sauce is to die for! I was full after half of the burger but I am a light eater. You would think this burger would be $10+ but it was only $6.95 I highly, highly recommend this place. I literally just walked out the door and I'm already writing a review because it's that good! also, the fries were extra yummy! 

It was such a clean place and the workers were very nice and helpful :)"}
{"text":"The food and service or both exceptional. Lots of dinner options, as well as several dessert options. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Stufrageous Stuffed Burgers is a great place to get a good quality burger for a reasonable price. The burgers were fresh and juicy. The staff were friendly and extremely helpful. Extended Family Disability Services would like to thank Stufrageous for their generosity and this amazing dessert."}
{"text":"what a great burger, I got a simple cheeseburger with cheddar and bacon.  The meat was delicious and the toppings were cooked into the middle instead of just falling off the top like most burgers.  There was a convenient chart to choose the type of bread I wanted with pictures.  Flavor was excellent.  By the way, this place is absolutely immaculate, this has to be the cleanest burger place I've ever been in.  Great job guys and great burger.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Wow! Words can't even explain the OUTRAGEOUS juicy greatness that Stufrageous stuffed burgers create. Upon entering this very clean great establishment we instantly were greeted by their super friendly staff. It was so hard to chose which burgers we wanted or whether we wanted to try their in house grinded chicken which also comes  stuffed. We chose to order a jalapeño melt stuffed burger and the cheddar Mac and cheese and bacon stuffed burger both were absolutely amazing. We had to try the cheddar Mac and cheese bites and the fried tempura beans which were both excellent and we dipped everything in their house made Outrageous sauce hands down the best dipping sauce known to man. I would recommend this place to anyone they have something for everybody.

Ps. Top your meal off with their warm just right chocolate chip cookie topped with a scoop of delicious frozen yogurt Oreo cookie and fruity pebbles just talking about it makes your mouth water"}
{"text":"Never go within an hour of them closing, apparently all hygiene or cooking standards go out the window. I had the pepperoni pizza burger last night at about 8:25 and it was delicious don't get me wrong but after spending an hour on the toilet I'm super disappointed."}
{"text":"So I gave this restaurant a lousy review about 3 days ago...I ordered through grub hub. The food that arrives is disgusting. 
The manager has now been sending me insulting messages, ( real mature dipshit).
In any event, he tries to tell me now, that the food that arrived, wasn't their food!! He posed the scenario that the grub hub driver, ATE HIS HAMBURGER, and substituted BURGER KING for his burger!!!
Let me tell you dude, I wish he had brought me burger king. It would have been a gift.
Instead, he brought me your crappy, cold burger and your cold onion strings.
This manager is unbalanced and making up a scenario where the delivery guy ate his burger, is just making me shake my head. I'm almost speechless, but then again, not too speechless to tell you eaters about my continuing harassment from this Weasley nutcase."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.... the food is outstanding.  Fried green beans are amazing and the mac and cheese burger  and the Ruben burger is The real deal. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. 

It was worth the drive from central phx. 

Darnell"}
{"text":"This place has amazing choices (great well thought out flavor combos) the cheese is super delicious and their outrageous sauce is to die for!! Just saw this place on the side of the street I drive home  from work and thought I'd try it out! Definitely gonna come back and try the chicken instead of beef"}
{"text":"Saw the reviews for this place and thought I would give it a try. A coworker and I tried calling in our order, but the phone line was busy. No biggie, we went and ordered there to go. We were pleasantly surprised when we went and there wasn't a line. That being said, it took 30 minutes for us to get our food! We brought it back to work and ate. It was nothing special, but might go back just for the fact it is close to work. Got the create your own stuffed chicken with american cheese and Mac n cheese (they forgot the american) and coworker got caprese chicken (missing the vinegarette)."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers I tried the mac and cheese burger it was amazing. Nice atmosphere. Good service. I would recommend."}
{"text":"I had the jalapeño popper burger and it was beyond satisfying. I am definitely coming here more often the manager that assisted me was incredibly friendly professional and helpful. Very happy with the service and the food!!"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm SUPER surprised about all the negative reviews on here. Really, for nit-picky stuff. I've been to this place 4 times and EVERY time EVERYTHING was good. My fries have NEVER been soggy, always hot and fresh and their sauce is amazing. I think the snob who said the bun wasn't brioche. pfffttttt. Get over yourself. I order the brioche bun every time and I don't care WHAT they call it - it's delish!!! I checked out Yelp to see how they're doing since I visited last because my son and I are going there for burgers tonight. Give this place a break people! They are a small business and I think MUCH better than most places around here. I'd really hate to see them go away now that I've found a craveable burger joint. And no, I did NOT get paid to write this review, I do NOT know the owners and I do NOT have any connection to this place. Sheesh. People  need to chill OUT!!!"}
{"text":"These stars are subject to change. Love the burgers. Great tempura green beans! A couple super sweet girls were taking orders and serving up yummy baskets of juicy goodness.  I'll definitely eat here again BUT  I can only give three stars because it was SO hot indoors that i was miserable. I'm am usually cold everywhere I go.  Not sure how the employees weren't killing each other.  The A/C wasn't blowing or even on?. They had two fans pushing hot air around the room. It felt better outdoors in July than sitting in the restaurant.   There were lock boxes over the air conditioning controllers. It was 90 in the back of the dining room away from the kitchen. What??  Mgmt, please install ceiling fans & give the mgr the key to the a/c."}
{"text":"Really good Burger!  Don't forget the green beans they are out of this world.

The service was really good and the restaurant is spotless clean."}
{"text":"This is a place you must go to multiple times to really appreciate they have so much on there menu that you need to be culinary adventurous."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with my wife, it was our first visit. The burgers were mediocre I had the Ruben burger it had very little pastrami my wife had the 3 cheese burger her's looked good with the cheeses oozing out but they mixed up our buns. The tempura green beans we got were not tempura battered the Mac and cheese bites were the best part of the whole meal. We paid $31 for 2 burgers, 2 sides and a shake which seems a bit high for a meal that was just average at best."}
{"text":"This place is new, but is amazing. Have eaten here a dozen or so times In the last 3 weeks. Heavy on salt, so those with blood pressure and heart problems, eat at own risk, everyone else, ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"Super delicious burgers and fries. The front counter gal that help me was very friendly, helped me select and smiled a lot. This place is awesome. I just wish they had more locations around the valley.  I'm sure they'll get many more if their service and food stay at five star level."}
{"text":"We are vacationing here with a large family.  Food was great!!! Each of us had a different burger and different sides.  The service was excellent....... actually, Absolutely amazing service.  I highly recommend Stufrageous.  Great food,  great price,  amazing service!!!  Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Awesome food and truly great people. We came in and there was a homeless patron sitting in a booth. We inquired discreetly as to if we could buy the guy a burger and the server told us they already did. AWESOME! Not just a restaurant, the start of an awesome spot in our community. Give these guys your money! Their food is great!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome and best part is they offer everything either in traditional beef or they offer chicken which is SUPERSPECTACULAR !!!!! A must have for anyone looking for FRESH DELICIOUS with phenomenal service."}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent. Upon hearing it was our first time visiting she gave us a sample of fries with their outrageous sauce, delicous! Food was very fresh and exactly as described. We had a chicken burger, probably the best I've ever had. Usually, chicken burgers are pretty bland, not here! It was delicous. Also had the outrageous fries. I will definitely be recommending this place to anyone looking for something different in a good burger! Fantastic! Trust the sauce and get creative!"}
{"text":"Overall I would come again. A good different take on a burger. Lots of flavor. The tempura green beans are really good."}
{"text":"The best hamburger I have ever had! Has a ton of options about buns, and which meat you want and so much more! Wish they had this back home."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, went there because of the raving reviews. I wouldn't necessarily agree. The burgers were OK- family consensus gave this place a \"3\".  The burgers were small, not very flavorful. The stuffing portion is very small. They do have a chicken or beef patty option which was nice. The butter bun was ok. The best part was the fries. They were light and crunchy and had a good flavor. Their house sauce was OK. Mac 'n Cheese was bland. The location was clean, limited seating for parties of 5+ (unless you are pushing tables and chairs together). The cashier was very nice and helpful and explained to us how to order."}
{"text":"This place is legit! The owner is super cool and the food is extremely delicious!  Very fresh and tasty! I recommend it to anyone who wants to be satisfied ! Awesome concept and very well managed!"}
{"text":"Unique burgers and chicken sandwiches in a casual, upbeat environment. I had the Greek chicken sandwich with the lettuce \"bun\". It was flavorful and juicy without being overpowering. The French fries were perfectly crisp and the Outrageous sauce was a nice compliment. My boyfriend got a beef burger which had BBQ sauce, bacon, and onion straws stuffed in it. It was good, too.

This stuff is fresh. Not only do they wait to cook it until you order it, it looked like they wait to form/stuff the patty until you order it!

I'm not a huge burger or sandwich fan, but this is a good place when for when I'm in the mood. It will run about $8 for the sandwich, and $3 for a small fries and a drink. The service was super nice, courteous, and professional. I would have given it 5 stars, except the meat portion seems just a little small for a $12 meal at a casual, walk-up-to-the-counter restaurant."}
{"text":"Our 9 year old son has been begging us to check this spot out. At first I thought it was another Smashburger type place with a gimmicky spin...I was totally wrong. This is a locally owned and operated business and I'm all about supporting local growth. The customer service was on point. The food was great! Tempura green beans were phenomenal. I had the BC&B and it was one of the tastiest bleu cheese burgers I've had in a while. I was a little worried when I saw the size of the burger but I have to admit, I walked out of there stuffed!! I wanted to try the dessert but I was way too full...next time though! If there's one thing my family knows, it's good food and this place serves great food! For the people attempting to compare this to mainstream franchises like In-N-Out Burger, there is no comparison. This place is not overpriced by any means. If anything, it may be underpriced when you take into consideration that this has more of a gourmet/bistro spin to it. If you're looking for something cheap, stick with McDonalds, Wendy's, Burger King, In-N-Out Burger, etc. If you're looking for a quality dining experience and impeccable customer service, choose Stufrageous!"}
{"text":"This place was super amazing! Great staff, amazing music, and most importantly, great food! I loved it! Very clean as well. I love the unique concept of the burgers, and that you can customise or have something to pick from. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from Michigan and I had to stop in to see what the hype was about. A friend of mine and I split the jalapeño melt and the Mac & cheese stuffed burger....I have to say for someone who eats burgers all the time, these burgers were BY FAR the best burgers I have ever had in my entire life, no exaggeration. My only regret was leaving before trying other menu options! The staff was super friendly and professional, and the chef took the time to see how my first Stufrageous experience went. Pretty sure she could already tell by the look on my face that it was nothing short of excellent. My advice to future customers: COME HUNGRY!"}
{"text":"Such fun burgers!  You can choose as little or as many things to have stuffed inside your burger patty.  Great sweet potato fries.  Great change from plain old burgers (they have beef, chicken or veggie burgers)."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with my wife after reading about this place in my yelp, phoenix email ! Restaurant was clean and we were greeted immediately upon entering, we were also offered a sample of they're secret spicy dressing which was quite tasty. I ordered the bbq burger w/pepper jack and the wife got the jalapeño popper burger. We found them to be juicy and very tasty and not just thrown together. Overall it was a good experience and for sure will be back !"}
{"text":"By far the best food IV ever had in Arizona !! Best burgers ever seriously !!!!! Home made sauce was unreal ! You gotta try it"}
{"text":"Awesome service and amazing burgers and fries!! We got the jalopeno cheddar burger and the blue cheese bacon burger. Both were delicious and we devoured both burgers. We also got the outrageous fries and Mac n cheese bites and both were amazing as well!! Highly recommend this place for the great food and super awesome staff!"}
{"text":"I randomly read about this place opening and just had to try it after looking at the menu. I had the jalapeño popper stuffed burger and although it looked smaller than I thought it would be, it was very filling! Looking forward to the next burger I get from there!

Also to add that the staff were very nice and friendly which is always a plus!"}

{"text":"Got the black bean brger with feta cheese & onion strings topped with outrageous sauce - which is just that,  outrageous. My lunchmate got the BCNB - burger stuffed with blu cheese & bacon. Both were delicious. We will definately be repeat customers."}
{"text":"Great good, group of six no one was disappointed.  Even better it. Is an independent shop and not a franchise.  Lots of variety unique beyond just a good burger.  Will plan to come back if in area.  Very clean inside. Very pleasant staff.  Great job!"}
{"text":"Tasty burger for a good price! The fries are crispy and the outrageous sauce was flavorful with a little kick. My husband and I got the southwestern chicken and Mac and cheese burger. Both were juicy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Solid choice - clean, good service, tasty food. The sweet potato fries were yummy, and the tempera green beans were a fun treat but kind of oniony flavor. I had the Hawaiian with chicken, DH had the bacon bleu cheese. His was better, because bacon, but mine was satisfying. The only negative comment I had is that the burgers were not huge for the price, so with some sides it added up. Oh, and my kid's grilled cheese didn't look that great, though he ate it all with no complaint. Don't know that we'd make it a destination, but if we're in the area it's a good choice."}
{"text":"Ordered the jalapeño popper burger and it was really tasty! Wish it had been spicy but that's ok! I was worried that with the patties being stuffed the amount of meat would be dismal. I'm glad I was wrong!"}

Dry buns

Quick and Dirty Review (Full Review Follows)
Nice, brand new burger joint! (I love burgers!)
Stuffed burgers make it unique to the area.
Staff was courteous and responsive.
Place was nice and clean, including the bathroom.
Burger and fries were delicious!
Everything was done in a timely fashion.
Price to food ratio was reasonable and fair IMO.
I will go back again and I will tell others about this place!

Full Review

I walked in just a little before 2:00 on a Friday afternoon.  I was greeted when I walked in the door. Nice touch these days!
Person who helped me asked if I had ever been there before.  Upon saying it was my first time in, she offered a sample of their Outrageous Sauce on a fry for me to try.  It was tasty.
Their focus is stuffed burgers and they have a number of signature selections pre-built or you can make your own (see pictures).
The number of options are plentiful, another reason I'll be back.  I saw at least four others I want to try, not to mention some ideas of my own.  Thinking I'll go back with additional people next time, so we can sample different burgers!
As others have mentioned, they bring out your order as it's completed.  This didn't bother me, as the fries arrived a few minutes after I got my drink and sat down.  They were piping hot and needed some cooling time, again a good problem to have IMO.
The burger arrived about five minutes later, fresh off the grill.
The fries were quite good and ample, somewhere in thickness between a McDonald's french fry and a steak fry.  I think they may have been lightly battered or coated with something.  It made them nice and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.
The Jalapeno Popper burger was prepared nicely. They toasted the white (brioche) bun and the stuffed burger was cooked through, which melted the philly cheese nicely.  The Jalapenos were chopped fresh as well.  Another plus in my book!
My burger, fries and a drink came to $9.45 with a 10% off yelp first time visit discount on my phone.
I thought even without the discount this was reasonable, considering the extra time it takes to prepare a stuffed burger.
I noticed some people complained about the patty size.  The proprietors claim they use 6oz of beef in each burger and I believe that to be true.  You can't go too thick on the beef with a stuffed burger, otherwise the inside just doesn't get cooked through.
Regardless, I thought the portions were ample for the price.
If you are expecting In/Out or other fast food pricing, don't, while it feels like a fast food joint, I wouldn't call it one.
Everything is made fresh to order, which I don't mind waiting a little extra time for.
Hopefully the others who had long wait times were victims of the place being pretty much brand new.
They are locally owned and not some big national franchise (yet)!
I will definitely go back and will bring others with me!
Keep up the great service and food!"}
{"text":"This was a great twist on a hamburger. It was moist and flavorful, great job! The best part of the whole thing is that it is easy to eat and not messy! Really like this place"}
{"text":"Every time my family comes to town, we go to Stufrageous. It is consistently good and so unique!"}
{"text":"My cousin was in town last weekend and we both like burgers.  we decided to try this place,  Wow what a shocker,  excellent food.  The mayo based sauce they used was Fantastic.  I thought for the amount of food given and for what we paid,  I think the burgers could be a tad bit bigger.  Fries were cooked perfect."}
{"text":"Just made the trek over to the west side for the \"Best\" burger in the Valley yesterday....now is the time to expand over to the East side of Mesa...in my neighborhood....perfect place on the corner of Signal Butte and Guadalupe, in the plaza of the Frys Marketplace they are putting up....come on Stufrageous....make us happy over here...."}
{"text":"Well let's start off with the cashier, the young woman that greeted me at the register was very helpful and polite. When she found out it was my first time visiting she offered up their house sauce to try. Not being a mayo type of person I have to say this stuff was very flavorful and definitely worth a try. She then went on to suggest a few different items on the menu along with suggesting some \"build your own\" ideas. 
Now onto the food, first up was the fries. As some others have said before they are covered in oil. Wasn't the end of the world but they need to work on those desperately!!! Their house sauce went perfect with the fries!
Then came the burger, I ordered up the BBQ burger minus the mushrooms but add jalapeños. The burger was GREAT! Good flavor and very juicy! Not over cooked and dried out as other have experienced on Yelp. All and all this place could have been a 5 star (which I rarely handout) if they could correct the issues with the fries. 
As a person that travels a lot for work this is one of the places I will make sure to visit again when I'm in the area next time!"}
{"text":"Best. Burger. Ever. I designed my own burger and it was amazing. The fries and house sauce blew my mind. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place kind of broke my heart. I love a good cheeseburger especially when the cheese is stuffed inside the meat. Unfortunately for me they put onions in the meat. If it was posted somewhere that desecrate their meat by adding onions then I must of missed it. 

The fries were good and the place was clean and the girl who took my order was friendly. If you like onions then you gotta check this place out but if you don't, then this place might not be for you."}
{"text":"It's usually a great place to eat.  The burger I ordered comes with to  tomatoes.  I asked them to slice the tomatoes in the burger and they charged me 39 cents.  I noticed it after the transaction was complete so I never bothered to get a refund, but it's about the principle.  I wish the cashier would have told me and let me decide.  If it was cheese or bacon, then I understand the up charge but no one charges for tomatoes!!"}
{"text":"Have heard nothing but great things about this place so I decided to check it out myself.  The first thing that stood out to me was how clean and nice it was.  Within seconds of walking in I was greeted by multiply staff members who were extremely friendly and each and everyone of them had a huge smile on their face. Being my first time they explained to me the concept of how things work and made some great recommendations.  WOW is all I can say when I took a bite into my burger.  Cooked to perfection and stuffed with fresh ingredients.  What an amazing concept they have.  The whole inside of the burger was stuffed which means I didn't go one bite without tasting the ingredients.  When you think about what I just said you may think of a huge mess,  but just as nice as the restaurant and staff was the presentation of the food was just as exceptional.  I would highly recommend this place to all friends and family and even strangers.  Can't wait to go back and try another piece of heaven. Great Job!"}
{"text":"Interesting menu, from burgers stuffed with mushrooms to stuffed with pizza. I tried the pizza variation, and I was not disappointed. Staff is friendly, and the facility is very clean. Different spin on the traditional cheeseburger fast food chains."}
{"text":"Yes, I found this place from Groupon. 

The decor is simply amazing, it is very clean and the layout works with everything.

You can see them cook your food right in from of you.

The hamburgers are pretty good, the fries and their house suace(fry sauce).

Would I go here again? Sure, why not. But as a college student I am too poor to eat there without the Groupon haha."}
{"text":"Well seasoned meat. Fun experience and lots of choices. Good fries but not fresh cut. Outrageous sauce was decent. Dessert looks good but will need to try next time!"}
{"text":"Good service! Reasonable prices. Good food! Will return. Oh yeah I love the Edison light bulds they use throughout the restaurant."}
{"text":"If you like burgers and you like being creative, this is the place for you! Here you make your burger from start to finish, starting with 3 types of buns or a lettuce rap. From there you add the ingredients you want in your burger. You can even get Mac and cheese on top of your burger, that's how creative this place is! Would recomend to anyone looking for a an above average burger!!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting and delicious concept!!  The burgers were great!!  My only complaint is the mac and cheese wasn't that cheesy which made the burger a little dry.   Otherwise great.  If we lived closer we would be back!  Go try this!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. I had the BBQ MOS made with ground chicken. Amazing flavors. The regular salad is huge and the croutons are fresh. Wish I was going to be in town longer so I could eat there again."}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to yelp, and was glad to have tried it. 
The Ruben burger was so delicious! I never had anything quite like this burger and I got stuffed easily. Meat wrapped around meat is yummo.
I suggest going here only if your starving, because the burger is huge and you need stomach room."}
{"text":"Good burgers but a bit small for the price. Basket of fries are plenty for a family of five to share. Was expecting a bit more based on the great reviews."}
{"text":"Wow! is all I can say about this place.

I went in there mildly curious about what a stuffed hamburger was, and came out a rabid fan.

I had the Ruben Stuffed Hamburger. In all my life, I have never had a hamburger this delicious. First of all, the actual hamburger itself was scrumptiously prepared - juicy, not dry. Secondly, it had pastrami and swiss cheese along with it. Oh my!

I intend to go back and get everything on the list. Then, I will start trying to come up with my own concoctions (which you can do as well).

GO HERE! and do it NOW!
Seriously."}
{"text":"Short and simple, you must go there. The burgers are fantastic and well worth the price. The fries were so good. Seriously a whole meal (burger, fries and drink) is more than enough. I'm already planning on when I can go back so I can bring my boyfriend. Beats all the other places I've been to, so fresh!"}
{"text":"Great chicken burger and outrageous fries. All food came out separately which was weird, but it was delish! Barq's red creme.....to die for."}
{"text":"I made my own. It wasn't terrible but just a little bland. The frys were good but so soaked with grease they almost leaked through the bag. The toppings came in a bag which is fine but I'd rather they be on it"}
{"text":"Revolutionary! This is what a good burger should be. The fries are perfectly crispy. Make sure to get the outrageous sauce. Don't let yourself down, and order a loaded cookie. 

Not to mention you can make any burger a chicken burger. I don't know why that option doesn't exist at any other restaurant.

Get your life together, and go eat here."}
{"text":"Burgers were good. Just on the smaller side. Fries were fresh and hot."}
{"text":"OMG Amazing food. We tried the mac and cheese bites (REALLY GOOD), outrageous fries with outrageous sauce and grilled onions (DELICIOUS), the blue cheese burger, the mac and cheese burger, and the caprese. If we had to rate them 1. mac & cheese burger, 2. blue cheese, 3. caprese.  Go here. It is worth it. $50 for all that!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for my birthday and the food was great! Very neat concept and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Loved it!"}
{"text":"WORST PLACE EVER DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!!!! A few co-workers and I went for lunch and waited an hour for our food! We had to take it to go! They packed the food in a hurry and and was a mess in the containers. Looked like slop with cheese!! The manager gave us a coupon for \"free fries\"! What in the world?! Sorry but free fries aren't going to make up for the horrible service, extra long wait and disgusting food!!!!"}
{"text":"Is there anything better than a mac & cheese stuffed burger? I'll answer that for you: No there isn't. Especially when paired with their fried mac & cheese bites or outrageous fries, this place can quickly become a dieter's guilty pleasure.

The service is about what you'd expect from what is essentially a fast food place, not exceptionally amazing but I've never had any problems aside from a couple \"I'd rather be anywhere else\" attitudes from the young ladies behind the counter. 

If I don't feel like leaving the house they have lots of delivery options, though be warned - I'm fortunate enough to live just about a mile away from Stufrageous so all the food is still hot and good when it gets here, but I've read reviews complaining about cold and soggy food from those who probably live farther away. It's probably worth it just to take the drive over there

My only complaint is that I wish there was an option to have them not cut the burger in half before it's served - I understand the concept, showing the stuffing on the inside, but a lot of times that just makes it extra messy to eat when it starts falling out of the burger, especially if you order a fried egg inside your burger... I'd rather not have yolk all over my hands before I even start eating.

Also I've seen numerous reports that the owner gets REALLY hostile when it comes to complaints... like, to the point of insulting customers because they didn't like something. I've never had a problem personally, but that seems like a huge red flag, incredibly unprofessional and something to look out for.

But overall it's an innovative idea for a burger joint, and with the tasty food and convenient location this has definitely become my go-to place whenever I want a burger! Just hopefully I don't ever need to speak to the manager..."}
{"text":"Found this place while driving by and finally went in to try it out. 

Our fries and fried green beans came out first and they were really good. Both were very crunchy and fresh. The outrageous sauce that came with it was spicy but really good too. 

Next our burgers came and our first bites came with a huge smile. I ordered the bbq m.o.s burger and it was perfect -- very juicy. My girlfriend ordered the Mac n cheese burger and it was an awesome. Her mom ordered the Hawaii burger which was also very good. 

The staff was very friendly and we received a free order of fries. 

Definitely will come back here in the future."}
{"text":"Thought we would try this place because of the reviews. ... it looks similar to a chain restaurant but it's not.  Nicely decorated. ....great staff and very yummy buggers.  The Outrageous sauce is fantastic! !! 
You can order online and they now do an 8oz burger."}
{"text":"Their Ruben Stuffed Sandwich is killer.... I dare you to eat just one!! :-) Great concept and extremely affordable considering most everything is made from scratch! Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Stufrageous earned all 5 stars and then some. Can't say how impressed I am with the staff and food. 

First off, the staff - just incredibly nice and helpful. When I stopped by for the 1st time a week ago, the guy at the register made some solid recommendations (thank God no one was behind me in line lol) and even \"hooked me up\" with extra Mac N' Cheese Bites for the kiddos. When I went back for a second visit on Saturday he remembered me and asked how my wife liked the burger he suggested (spoiler alert - she loved it) and thanked me for coming back. Again, friendly and hospitable. 

The food - the burger patty itself is pretty large and is pretty good, but obviously the inside is what makes it so good. If it's your first visit, you have to try the Mac N' Cheese stuffed burger. Sounds weird, but the creamy, cheesy goodness in every bite is ridiculously good. The bacon and blue cheese stuffed was pretty good, just not on the same level as the mac n' cheese. The Hawaiian is going to be my next burger of choice. Oh, and they do a really good lettuce wrap. It can get a little messy, but they are right up there with In-N-Out with quality lettuce wrap burgers. 

Their outrageous sauce must be what Ed's secret sauce from Good Burger tasted like. Just ridiculously good. It has a nice little pop in it without being too spicy. I'm surprised they don't sell the sauce as a standalone product. 

Their fries are different from most fast food fries and I love em. They're more like seasoned fries you'd get at a sit down restaurant.

Also, thought it was pretty cool they have the Barq's red cream soda as a soft drink choice. Don't always see that as an option.

Cleanliness - the place is well maintained and clean, which shouldn't be too surprising because they've been around for only a few months. 

Word to the wise - it takes about 15 minutes for them to freshly prepare your grub, so if you'll be in a rush, call ahead and swing by to pick it up."}
{"text":"Food was Delish. Loved the stuffed burger and and fries. First time here and the customer service was even better than the food. Clean restaurant friendly workers and very accommodating. When my wife told them that she wanted her burger cooked more, whiteout hesitation, they not only cooked her a new one but also gave her free burger voucher with a smile. Sad to say, but you don't see that too often today. 

Definitely coming back here again. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"This place was great from the start. Excellent service, food was filling I got the double stacked Mac and cheese burger, (I like to test these places that say they got double burgers) this was it. The house sauce they got was great! A family of 9 ate for about 85$ totally worth it!"}
{"text":"If you want to make your own stuffed burger this is the place to try!  I don't have a single dislike about this place.  Everything from the fries, sides and burgers are amazing.  Oh and for dessert they use Thrifty ice cream.  What more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"I always get the mac n cheese burger and it's always excellent. Great selections available and I love that your u can build your own. I need to try the desserts soon."}
{"text":"I love a good birger and i would say this place is just ok.  The stffings and minimal and the flavor is lacking.  I ordered a capese styffes chicken burger.  Hardley any flavor.  I also got overstuffed fried but it only has cheese and jalapeño on it.  It was just ok but i know i would have gotten a better burger at Red Robin for the same price."}
{"text":"Great burger and fries. The staff was helpful and offered samples, now I'm hooked on the amazing sauce."}
{"text":"Very interesting place. First time here and employees make you feel welcomed and help you out, even gave us a sample of their house made sauce. Burgers are one of a kind and they have a huge variety! Would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good burger. Fries are amazing and definitely need to try their special sauce along with them! Got the 3 cheese stuffed burger and it left me drooling while my boyfriend got their infamous Mac n cheese and jalapeño burger which was much better then it sounds. Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Pros:
-Clean
-Good burgers 
-Best fries (ever!)

Cons:
-none"}
{"text":"The best thing here was the black raspberry tea....
The burgers..cheap meat...and not stuff...a patty on top of an another patty.... No flavor at all.  I had the Hawaiian burger.  I could not taste the teriyaki nor the pineapples.   I wouldn't recommend this place at all...and definitely not returning.....
I tried to give a half a star but couldn't."}
{"text":"We got the Mac and cheese burger... Amazing! On Wednesdays you get a free order of fries with the purchase of a stuffed burger... And they serve a selection of beers! Service was also incredible. The cashier explained the menu thoroughly and the food was done promptly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I happened on this unique burger joint while running errands. The up-beat staff gave great service and prepared great food. The menu, as the name suggests, is centered on stuffed burgers. The meat is ground beef, chicken, or veggie. You can order off the set menu or customise. I went with chicken, a Greek stuffing and lettuce wrap. Excellent."}
{"text":"While the sauce still lingers on my tongue I'll pen my review: soooo satisfying!! I tried the Hawaiian with ground chicken, my son (8 year old) had plain cheese burger and hubbie tried the mac-n-cheese burger. It was all very good and cooked to perfection! Mine was sweet, savory and a slight hint of spice (used the outrageous sauce). Fries are cooked to crisp glorious golden brown (melt in my mouth goodness!) I can't wait to return to try more menu items and Justin (the manager) was friendly and made the experience a 10+! Thank you stufrageous burger, we'll return!"}
{"text":"Very delicious... too far from my house but worth the 40 minute drive... It's like a burger with stuff in it.. hence the name of the place lol. Very fresh and delicious combinations... I get the greek stuffed  Get the sweet potato fries they are bomb.com!!!"}
{"text":"Found on groupon was in neighborhood. Fantastic food friendly staff and free fries on Wednesday! I will be a repeat customer"}
{"text":"Had the macaroni and cheese beef burger - it was surprisingly a great combination!! (I'm sure the bacon and jalapeno helped!)
The fries were great, and the sauce unique.  Definitely worth going back - can't wait to try more!!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time eating here. The first time I had a burger that was stuffed with mushrooms, Swiss, and topped with onion straws. It was pretty good. Today, I had the pepperoni pizza burger on a brioche bun. It was amazing. I love that the burgers aren't super greasy. Great place for a quick burger fix. The Mac and cheese bites are very good, and oddly enough tastes even better dunked in marinara sauce. The cheesy bacon fries were okay...i kind of thought the cheese was going to be like melty nacho cheese consistency and it was not. Cute little place and very clean."}
{"text":"We ordered from here delivery through door dash or grub hub, one of those... the food arrived still warm which was great! The burgers were tasty.  Nothing to special I found more a tad dry no major seasoning in the meat itself, but the toppings/filling were good. Min had bleu cheese a bc&b, and my hubby ordered something messy and full of yum a jalapeno or spicy something... the kids shared a hot dog.  Which I didn't try,  but kids love stuff like that. 
The fries were yum considering how fries get when they are take out or delivery.  I would like to try this place again,  in the actual location."}
{"text":"I won a free burger in a contest on Instagram and I could not have been more lucky! This place is so good. I love that they have the option of having a chicken burger (which is what I ordered). I got the Mac and cheese one and honestly hands down one of the best burgers I have eaten. At least in a really long time. I got sweet potato fries with it and ended up taking half home because I was full. I brought 2 friends with me that ordered different things than I did and both of them loved their burgers. I can't wait to go back! I also got a dessert with my win and we all shared the cookie with ice cream and Oreo's. My goodness. Definitely five stars."}
{"text":"Walking in, this looked like any other casual burger joint.  But the food and service were way beyond our expectations!  They offer the opportunity to select your own ingredients to be stuffed into the heart of a succulent burger patty (or chicken) and suggest some uber creative chefs ideas.  We ordered 4 burgers and shared them around to get a taste of each.  Each one had a unique taste that was a meal in itself. We'll be coming back for more!  Besides the food, the staff is extremely attentive and courteous.  Not in the cliche burger-hipster way, but genuinely."}
{"text":"Found this gem on Yelp. Best burger place ever! Great shakes and I love the jalapeño popper burger a must have. Their fries are outstanding! Love the sauce!"}
{"text":"Wife and I have made this our \"go to\" burger place. The burger patty is stuffed with your \"toppings\".

I've had 4 different burgers, and all have been excellent. Thick, fresh, moist, flavorful burgers. I think my favorite is the Mac n cheese.

The pepper jack Mac n cheese bites are so good with bits of jalapeño. The outrageous sauce is some sort of siratcha sauce mixed with mayo and maybe some relish. Really good but a little spicy. 

Overall, this place is awesome. 

Only thing I would change is the price. Knock off $1-2. I'd go way too much if the price was less.

Yummy!"}
{"text":"Such a great burger place! We walked in and the staff was ver friendly and she gave us a sample of their special sauce. I highly recommend this restaurant, it's cute and the food is Delicious, it great quality beef and ingredients and the fries are on point. The price point isn't too high it's a good mid range and it's worth it for the quantity and quality of this food. I will defiantly be coming back to eat here with my family."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends and have to admit I had a very wary approach to the idea of stuffed meat. Growing up as a kid I had a few of those Oscar Meyer cheese stuffed franks and that really put me off the idea. But Stufrageous is really different. Very juicy delicious hamburgers and the cheese is greatand the menu is packed full of gourmet options. They have 3 cheese burgers and its all done fresh on the premises. Their french fries are also very flavorful and any restaurant that stocks sriracha as a topping option gets a bonus in my book.

Plus they do have a non stuffed burger that's also awesome and delish if you arent ready for the stuffed burger concept.

In closing, the Oscar Meyer wiener mobile crashed the other day and I have to think its because they knew they couldnt pull off cheese stuffed food anymore. Truth."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and have tried a few variations!  Think I need to keep trying to get a burger I really really like because thus far this place doesn't exactly set the world on fire for me!  The Outrageous sauce as far I can tell is Sriacha, Mayo, and sesame oil.  Pretty positive that's exactly what it is, good on the fries, but it's geared more for a fish taco versus a burger, so next time I think I'll opt for Mustard-Mayo, maybe try a chicken burger next time!  The Mac&Cheese Burger, and Jalapeno Melt just weren't as great as I was hoping they would be.  Not ready to give up this place, just need to find a burger that will definitely get me excited about going!  Right now I could take it or leave it, and feel as though the In N Out a block away from this place is twice as good for half the price!"}
{"text":"You know what sucks? When you are psyched up to try something and then when you are ready to go, you start feeling down/ill. That is what happened with me and Stufrageous when I met a friend there. I just wasn't 100%. However, with that said, I still loved it!

I got the Mac & Cheese burger, sans tomato and jalapenos. It was delicious. I do admit though, I have a bit of a thing for M&C, so there is that too. I wish I was feeling better so I would have been more inclined to try the fries too. I did get a sample fry with their house sauce, which was delicious (also go it on my burger).

I felt like the place was kind of a build it as you want it kind of place. I don't know their limits, but I felt like if someone wanted a burger with M&C, a fried egg, and M&Ms... that they would try their best to make it happen. 

I would say that Stuf isn't my favorite burger place... but it surely beats everyone's pants off on novelty and uniqueness! I think that is their niche anyways!

The speed of service seemed to be somewhere between fast food and a sit down restaurant. Which is good. The people working the counter came over and asked if we needed anything a few times too, which was also nice for that \"blend\" of fast food and a sit-down formal restaurant.

I will be back, and hopefully feeling a little bit better next time so I can better sample the offerings."}
{"text":"From the name...thought their burger would be huge. But it is just like any burger joint. Their sauce is not that great. Plus their meat is kind of bland. Probably would not come back."}
{"text":"I wanted this to be amazing.  I wanted it to be oozing and fantastic and indulgent. Instead it was filling and not bad.  For a McDonalds, this would be fine, but for a place called Stufrageous I kind of wanted to come out hating myself.  I didn't, sadly.

The thin lifeless patties are necessary to form around the stuffing, I get that, but they're flavorless and essentially exist as a gummy-shell to surround whatever you chose to have your burger stuffed with.  I got one with pastrami on it (was it a reuben?) but the pastrami was thick and stringy and more like shitty ham steak.  The crispy onion straws might have been the best part, actually.  But it was ok, and it was filling, and the service was fine.  The fries were beer battered and I liked them, though others at my table didn't quite love the seasoning.

This is one of those places that should knock your socks off, so when you come out feeling \"ehhh\" it almost makes it worse.  Like I'd almost rather have a mediocre fast food burger just because A) it's cheaper and B) I already know I'll be disappointed.

It's JustOKrageous."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I had the mac and cheese burger, my husband had the Hawaiian burger and both were delicious. Also, they have red cream soda! The menu has fried green beans, I didn't try them but I will on the next visit."}
{"text":"Love this place. One in a million. Mac and cheese burger mhhhh. Oh and the pepper jack Mac n cheese bites. Wow. Can't seem to stay away!! Don't want to!"}
{"text":"So firstly,  I ordered to-go today,  and the girl on the phone who was working the front counter was INCREDIBLY nice, genuinely so,  so that was a nice first impression.  We ordered the Mac and cheese burger,  and Mac and cheese bites (I love cheese ok..).  The meal was absolutely delicious,  and I am already obsessed.  The food,  service and kind atmosphere will definitely be remembered and I will be telling others to go here to eat :) 
Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Awsome place! Can be stuffed with whatever you like! I had the mac and cheese and bacon"}
{"text":"Horribly weak execution of a simple item, the cheeseburger... 4oz burger meal at just about $12... white iceberg lettuce, mushy pickle, half slice of pink tomato (seriously???) Way overcooked extra well done tiny patty, frozen fries. Unreal. I hoped to see at least a little passion here but it is long gone if it was ever there..."}
{"text":"Burgers were amazing! I had the Hawaiian. 4 stars because of the long time to get the burgers while they were dead, and the mac n cheese bites weren't very good."}
{"text":"Food was delicious I went for Fathers Day to try something different and casual. I got the 3 cheese burger with sweet potato fries. My entire party enjoyed there meal I feel it was reasonably priced for what you get. I will definitely go back. You get a free soda for checking in on Yelp"}
{"text":"Very pricey. Went with my wife and 2 kids. Cost was $43  4 burgers 2 fries 1 mac and cheese bites 2 drinks. Would not go again. Meat was not very good."}
{"text":"I would definitely go here again. It's a really unique, nice staff, clean place and a fairly straightforward menu. I didn't like the bun very much, but the burger part was delicious. I got the mac'n'cheese with peppers. I would not recommend the milkshakes, they are just soft serve ice cream. I hope people try this place, it's a good price and new!

Update: management is very good, they responded to my concerns and have made me very happy!"}
{"text":"Amazing , best burgers I've ever had in my life. The Ruben and pizza burgers are my favorite ! And make sure you get the tempura greens beans and dip them in the outrageous sauce! You also have 2 options for fries : sweet potato or regular ( not to mention you can get these fries outrageous style), can't go wrong ! :D"}
{"text":"My husband and I just went here. The restaurant was nice and inviting. There was only one other table but we sat in the back because a lot of the tables were dirty.
Our burgers were ok. The meat really lacked flavor and needed a little seasoning in our opinion.
The fries were also really salty- and I love salty fried but it was too much.
We don't think we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is nice inside. Service was good. Food must be made fresh as it took a while to get our good. I got the mac n cheese burger. This place would be amazing if the meat had some flavor. It seems they try to cover up the bland burger by providing various toppings inside. The fries were very good. Overall it did not work for me. I would not be back."}
{"text":"The bugers are fantastic! You can stuff them with whatever you want. The outrageous sauce is sweet and spicy."}
{"text":"I just needed to do a quick update to my review because in my first review I did not mention the excellent price point. The cost is more than reasonable and i would pay significantly more for a comparable meal at lots of burger places.  

Also on my most recent visit they remembered my exact order that I wanted which made me feel pretty special."}
{"text":"I don't know why we didn't try this place sooner, but we'll be back soon. You can either build your own, choose one of their creations, or do what I did and build on one of their creations. Melissa had the Hawaiian, which was stuffed with pineapple, cheese, and ham. Mine was jalapeño, onions, cheese, and mushrooms. They were great! Great service too."}
{"text":"This place beyond awesome! Let's start with the manager asking us if it was our first time.
Since it was she explained the whole menu and even let us try sauces and sides to see what we wanted on the burger. I ended up getting the sliced jalapeño melt. SO SO SO SO BOMG! the meat was juicy and with the jalapeños and sun dried tomatoes I DID NOT want it to end. The staff was very attentive and it was a very clean restaurant. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Got a sweet Groupon($15 for $30) and finally went to try this meat and carb feast today. Customization of food is all the rage these days and Stufrageous did not disappoint. First impression is that the atmosphere was clean, modern and simple like 5 Guys. We arrived around 2:30 on a Thursday and there were only two tables occupied and all were ready to leave. Even though it wasn't busy, every booth and many tables were all sitting there dirty. 

The gals (yes, I know I sound like your granny ;-) ) at the counter were super sweet, patient and helpful when we asked for suggestions. I built my own burger and she highly recommended the brioche bun. I filled with mozzarella cheese, spinach and Mac n Cheese and topped with Stufrageous sauce, lettuce and tomato. Wish they had pickle chips to put on my burger instead of a spear on the side. Hubby and I split an order of fries and tempura green beans. He also built his own burger and we got two drinks. The total was about $25 but definitely worth it (especially with a Groupon). 

The food was friggin' awesome! Fresh, perfectly cooked and great meat to topping ratio. The fries were almost beer battered...like a crunchy tempura breading. The green beans were like TGI Friday's version and were great with the signature sauce.

Other than the dirty tables and lacking pickle chips, the only other negative was  the lame-o selection of drinks (a few coke products, pink lemonade, sports drink and a tea). There was something off about the drinks as though the syrup packs needed changing. The workers tasted it and said it was weird and gave us bottles of soda and water at no charge (thanks!). 

The service was friendly, food fresh, delicious and came out in reasonable time (within 10 min-brought to your table). We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"YES! This place was amazing. Great service, AMAZING burgers & dessert cookie! We got the Mac and cheese burger and the cream cheese jalapeño burger...wow! Plus loaded bacon cheese fries. The picture shows how epic it was"}
{"text":"This was my first time in AZ and all I kept hearing about was STUFRAGEOUS...I must say I am SO glad I gave it a try, not once, but twice--it was THAT good. After leaving, I literally had zero desire of trying In N Out.

First, let me start of by saying the staff is so warm, welcoming, professional, helpful and upbeat. The restaurant itself is very clean, stylish and the menu is very easy to read. This is also a perfect place to hold parties, because they have a spacious area in the back that can seat large parties/groups of people. 

I tried the tempura fried green beans, which were fresh, perfectly golden and crispy--not your usual soggy, bland fried vegetable that you'd typically get at a bar. I also tried one of their newer menu items: the French fries which are glazed in cheese, topped with bacon, and jalapeños (per my request!) I would literally fly back to AZ just for those. 

Now for the burgers: I tried the Southwest burger, Mac and Cheese Stuffed chicken burger, and the jalapeño melt burger...all were extremely juicy, thick, flavorful, unique, and most importantly, fresh! I see that some complained about the 10-15 minute wait for the burger to be ready, but the wait is WORTH it, especially with the finish product you receive. 

Dessert: we tried the fresh baked Macadamia nut and chocolate chip cookie topped with ice cream, crushed Oreos and fruity pebbles. This is self explanatory= perfection. Lastly, I tried the fruity pebbles milk shake (they also offer different kinds I.e. Reeces peanut butter cup milkshake, Oreo milk shake). This is the type of place I'd even come to just for dessert :-)

All in all--this is a MUST when in AZ. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesomeness!!!! The customer service was incredible. Very helpful and knowledgeable. Greeted us , checked on us and wished us a great holiday as we left. She made some suggestions to help us maximize our experience. She was great. The cook and the other lady who was cleaning was also very attentive. First time, but not the last."}
{"text":"Freaking awesome food... it! Green beans are the bomb.com
I had the chicken with jalapeños and cheese. Mt husband had the 3 cheese. Both were wonderful and the staff was soooo nice! I love that this place is walking distance from my house!"}
{"text":"This place is closed to my work and I'm always excited to make a trip over here to get stuffed. They have a swell menu of both Chicken and Beef Burgers and the toppings are actually cooked inside the burger.

Inside is very cool and a bit trendy with a several eating areas to enjoy your meal. Just place your order at the counter and bring the number that they give you to your table. The food magically appears once it is completed in their nifty open kitchen.

Ordered the Jalapeno Melt with Beef on my first visit with a side of Tempura Green Beans. The burger was stuffed with Sliced Jalapeños, American Cheese & Pepper Jack Cheese. Tried out the Chicken Caprese burger on my next visit which is stuffed with Fresh Mozzarella Cheese, Basil, a Tomato slice & drizzled with Balsamic Vinegar.

The burgers are really good and the Outrageous Sauce is very tasty as well. You can choose from a couple types of bun or go naked with some Lettuce around the outside.

Service is friendly and they are very helpful when it comes time to order. These are not inexpensive burgers but the quality of the product is very fresh and they are prepared with TLC.

Would like to see the option of getting a double patty version (NOW AVAILABLE) of what they offer but was told it is currently not in their system. I'm crossing my fingers and hoping they get it figured out soon. After all I'm a growing boy and need my protein. MEAT GROUP!

4.5 STARS"}
{"text":"Well worth the price and the food is phenomenal. The staff is friendly and they have my gluten free options! What more could a girl ask for? Shakes! And they have them too..."}
{"text":"Well. We went here today for lunch and the few reviews didnt dissapoint! We had the fries, fried mac &cheese YUM. Also had the stuffed Hawaiian  burger and the stuffed green chilies burger. Service was fast and friendly, the food was delish."}
{"text":"When I was ordering, the girl at the counter seemed like I was troubling her, especially anytime I had a question. She seemed either extremely bored, tired, or bothered by me. It was strange. 

The burger patty is stuffed with whatever you want, I chose mac n cheese, cream cheese and  sauteed onions, and then on the side are the usual toppings like tomatoes, onions, and lettuce which acts essentially as a side salad. 

I appreciate the creativity and idea of this place. Very unique. But they need to work on their service. Also, it is pretty pricey, for my one burger it was over $10."}
{"text":"This place stuffs their burgers with different ingredients. Their most popular burger is the Mac and cheese. I tried the Greek which has sun dried tomatoes, feta, and mushrooms. My biggest fear was that the meat would be soggy or not cooked well but it seems like they have the science down because the burger was perfect. They also give you choices of buns and have shakes and deserts that look delicious. They also have this outrageous sauce that at first taste really weird because it's not what I was expecting but it is very unique unlike any special sauce I've ever had, it was a mix of Asian with thousand island with a kick to it."}
{"text":"So, there is a reason by this place has such a great score with so many reviews. These Burgers are WONDERFUL!!!!! In all truth, I am not a big \"burger\" person, but these have so much flavor and are made so well that I would eat there again in a heart beat! I can't wait to bring my family and show them as well.
There is only one problem with them, they only have one location in Meas. Stufrageous, I hope you read this. Please, please, PLEASE bring another location to Central Phoenix!!!!! We would go there so often if it was closer and I know so many other people would too!"}
{"text":"My burger came out slower than I expected, and the staff wasn't overly friendly, however, the burger was AMAZING. I got the Greek burger on the brioche bun with 1000 island sauce and I could not have been happier with it."}
{"text":"Great place - fun menu - nice change for something different.  The manager and staff were really nice and helpful. Nice atmosphere.  Clean!  Dave has the Mac and cheese burger and I had the Hawaiian.  Both excellent.  We saw them delivering tempura green beans to s table so you tried them as a side.  There sauce was mummy. Way too much to eat... 
It was a  Tuesday night - 7:30 - and the place was steadily busy!

We'd definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place this past Friday.  Restaurant was clean when we came in and semi-busy.  This place fits in a different category of burger places for me.  Its definitely above a \"in and out burger\", but below a sit down place like Rehab burger in Scottsdale.  Our cashier was new and the manager had to come over and help her a couple of times.  Everyone was friendly.  The burger itself was ok.  That seemed to be the consensus around the table.  The burger meat seemed to be of a decent quality and the ingredients were ok, but I was not wowed.  I had the \"triple cheese\" stuff burger.  I would go back and give it another try if I was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Wow!!! I Have anticipated this opening for quite some time now..and it was well worth the wait.The Stuffed Mac N Cheese is just pure heaven . Filled with flavor ,cooked to perfection , pretty much melted in my mouth with every bite. Can I mention the fact that there's also an option for fried green beans besides fries??? Those with their outrageous sauce is life changing. The staff was very friendly and very servicing to their customers and can I say Very Very Clean! I look forward to coming back to your location for the tastiest stuffed burgers in Az . Thank you for this amazing new place for me to indulge in :)"}
{"text":"really good  food  diffently  will  be  back here great food fast service  my buger is really good the mac and cheese  thanks for  the  free drink for checking  in."}
{"text":"I visited tonight with my husband. He ordered a burger while I ordered the chicken; we both got the BBQ M&O.  I bought a combo so we also received fries and a drink. 

The order itself took about 20 to 25 minutes to arrive at our table. I wish it wasn't so long but it's worth the wait.  My husband liked his burger and I enjoyed my chicken.  Since we ordered the same thing I asked my husband if he wanted half of mine and I could take half of his.  I'm not a huge burger fan but I liked it.  I believe this is our third time at this restaurant and I would gladly come backf"}
{"text":"So delicious!!! I had a caprese stuffed chicken burger and couldn't put it down.. my sweet potato fries got cold because I ate my whole burger first! Thanks for being awesome Fabi! And don't forget to tell Jenna to open one up on the far west side lol.."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try the new Stufrageous Burger place off 54th and Ray Road last night.  Worst dining experience of my life.  There were two parties in the restaurant when we arrived. We had to wait about 10 minutes just to order, but there was no one in line in front of us.  After placing our order and waiting 36 minutes (time stamp on receipt at time of order-) we still did not have our food.  There were three people working, but it was very disorganized!  The party after us got food before us.  When we went to the counter to ask about our order, they didn't know where our food was.  We asked for a manager, we were told there was no manager on duty.  Our money was refunded, but we were in the restaurant for over 45 minutes--during that time there were only 4 parties in the place.  It shouldn't be that hard to get four orders correct in 45 minutes...Wondering if anyone has been to this location and had prompt service?"}
{"text":"I got the Ruben burger/beef. So much flavor! Very delicious and juicy burger. Did not disappoint for my first time being here, will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty great. We came on a Friday (while my husband was here in Mesa for business) for lunch and it was very quiet. The girl behind the counter was helpful and friendly and our food came up quickly.

We shared sweet potato fries which were really good and I got the Greek burger. You can customize your burger bun, meat and toppings. My husband ordered a milkshake that I sampled that was pretty good too, creamy and nice thick consistency. 

It's pretty casual, and they are kid friendly so bring the whole family! Really solid choice for a burger."}
{"text":"One of the BEST Burgers/Chicken  on the planet! Good thing this is not close to my house or I will be here everyday!"}
{"text":"First time there today, I had the burger stuffed with bacon and bleu cheese, it was perfect!! I've tried this burger stuffing at home with no luck, these guys have it dialed in to perfection!  I will definitely be bringing back friends and family!  Staff was very accommodating explains the menu to me! Great job guys!!"}
{"text":"Omg omg omg Ican't express my excitement about this place. The idea amazing, the food fabulous,the service awesome,the food (again) fanfreakinfabulous ...try it!! Share this place with your friends  @  can I get a whoop whoop"}
{"text":"This place has delicious burgers and the service is great! Love the idea of having stuff stuffed into a hamburger. I got the one with the mushrooms. Soooo good. 

Kinda expensive though. I also ordered a regular, unstuffed, no cheese, single hamburger with ketchup only and it was $7!!

Don't know if I will return even if the sticker shock wears off. :/"}
{"text":"Stuffed Burgers? Heck Yes!  had a buddy with me, so we split a chicken mac & cheese burger and a beef jalapeno melt. OMG! we got a side of tempura green beans and sweet potato fries.  Hands down, up there with the best burgers we ever had.  Don't leave without getting their in house baked cookie, one was enough for both of us.  It came out to us with a scoop of ice cream! I'll be back!! so glad i live 5 minutes from here!!!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight and this was the best decision I've made all day! I had the signature Mac N Cheese burger with fries and a drink. When I got the burger and bit into it, it was like I lost my burger virginity it was so good! And the fries are just as good! Definitely will be back for more!"}
{"text":"We met the owner, Jenna, in Mexico a few weeks ago and she was absolutely charming. So we decided to give Stufrageous a spin :). The appetizers alone were enough to leave you stuffed and happy, they had an array of dipping sauces (all of which were fantastic) and the burgers that followed were mouth watering. I got the macncheese burger, my mom got a BBQ burger that had mushrooms, cheesy goodness, and some onions (she loved it), and my dad ordered a chicken lettuce wrap that had southwestern seasoning and green peppers. There are an array of different dessert options available, our favorite was a cookie with ice cream and whipped cream on it, but their milkshakes were delightful as well! The staff was incredibly friendly, and we had an awesome experience, I would 12/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"This place may have became my favorite burger joint. Was looking up somewhere to get some lunch and came across this place. I got the Jalapeño melt burger. The most amazing burger I have had in some time and the sauce was something else."}
{"text":"The burgers were really good and juicy the french fries were all right the Mac bites very good with marinara sauce the chocolate malts were very delicious Service was excellent don't forget to try the outrageous sauce also when we were finish he asked if we would like to try a new menu item stuffed hot dog for free we got it stuffed with Ruben crazy good with outrageous sauce drizzled over it"}
{"text":"Stuffrageous Stuffed Burgers is a great sounding concept that compelled me to give it a try. While the execution did not fully live up to the promise of the idea, it still turned out to be a decent burger joint. 
The interior is pretty generic, but it was clean and welcoming enough for a dine-in order. The staff was all girls and they were friendly, but not the most outgoing or helpful. To be fair, we showed up 30 mins before closing, so they were probably pretty tuckered out from stuffing burgers all day.
The menu has some interesting pre-selected stuffed burgers, and also has a build-your-own option with each stuffing ingredient an extra $0.39. Not sure how many of those they can actually stuff into one patty, my guess is probably about 3 if you want the burger to stay together in your hands. 
And it doesn't seem like they actually \"stuff\" the burger patty, looks more like it's two layered patties with the stuffing just placed in the middle. 
For a burger joint, its a bit pricey - you are paying about $2-3 more for the \"stuff\" gimmick. We had 2 burgers, 1 order of fries and 1 drink and it was $20!  $7 for a burger and $6 for fries and a drink, keeps Stuffrageous as a \"once in a while\" burger joint, not a regular go-to. 
That being said, the burgers are good. Not great, and better than not-bad. Just right in the middle - again, making them a bit overpriced. We both chose a sesame bun which was exactly as expected. We got the Caprese and the Hawaiian. Both tasted exactly as expected - lots of basil flavour in the Caprese and the Hawaiian was all teriyaki and pineapple (the pineapple was not fresh). I was not blown away by either burger, but the fact that they satisfied base expectations keeps this place at 3 stars. Would try the burgers again, just not in any rush to do so.
As far as the fries - those were quite good. Nice and crisp with some seasoning on them for flavour. The Stuffrageous Sauce seems like ketchup, mayo and hot sauce, and was really more piquant than I would have preferred. We just stuck to dipping the seasoned fries in ketchup - the special sauce was too much. 
So in conclusion - good fries, decent burger, fun concept, but a little overpriced."}
{"text":"The best burger this guy has ever had. Cooked to perfection, melts in your melt, oozing with flavors. So many combos to choose from and if you don't see a combo you like you can create your own. I had the Jalapeño Melt which was divine but also sampled from family the pepperoni and mac and cheese burger. Also very good. And to top it off, $2.99 milkshakes!! My only complaint is that I am from CA and this is only location. Start branching out please."}
{"text":"I was in the area with the family and Yelp steered me toward Stufrageous. My 4 year old is as picky as they come and he loved the Mac and Cheese burger and it was no problem to customize and leave off the jalapeños. All of our burgers were great and the staff was very friendly. Give it a try if your in the area, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Burgers are just ok.  They serve the veggies(lettuce pickles tomatoes onions) on the side, to me that's a plus.  I picked the sesame seed bun and it was like a typical sesame seed bun.  Kinda dry and too thick.  Burger seemed to be steamed rather than cooked in a flat top as it really lacked that nice sear. The fries and the Asian style dipping sauce was the best part."}
{"text":"Truly a surprise gem in Mesa!  Upscale niche stuffed burger joint, all food made to order.  Choose your bun, your meat, your stuffing, and patty size and you will be mouth watering drooling in about 9 minutes.  Standard burger is 6oz, I upgraded to 8 oz, or you could double up two 6 ounces!  The bun choices are brioche, sesame, or wheat.  Their signature sauce has a mild kick, great for dipping your piping hot French fries!  Have to go back and try the other menu options and stuffings.  Some of the combos are a must try, Hawaiian, Asian, Caprese, Jalapeño popper and more. Don't miss out."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite burger joint, hands down. The jalapeño popper stuffed burger was phenomenal and the fries were done to perfection. The outrageous sauce is divine as well."}
{"text":"The burgers were amazing, both chicken and ground beef options are freshly prepared and so delicious! 
Definitely try the pepper jack mac n cheese balls!


The customer service was awesome! My boyfriend mentioned how much he loved the outrageous sauce and they gave us a few containers to go!"}
{"text":"There are many new burger concepts out there - this one should survive - very tasty, cool concept, spicy mac-n-cheese burger that you can eat like a burger (not with a fork) - what's not to love?  The Outrageous sauce was very good also - both on the burger and for the fries - think of it like Utah's ubiquitous 'fry sauce', but with a kick.  They need more locations!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing... I am here for a few days from Cleveland and we have nothing like this.  Great burger, great fries, and the outrageous sauce is very good.  Might go back before we fly back."}
{"text":"Customer service was poor, the gal that took our order gave the impression, she'd rather not be here, getting her to interact with us was like pulling teeth. 4 of us ordered food, 2 of us liked what we ordered, the other 2 said they would not want to return here."}
{"text":"First off, always props to a place that gives you options. You can get a regular burger.. Or a stuffed one crafted to your choice or one they already have on the menu. I got the stuffed Ruben which is 2 patties stuffed with pastrami, cheese and crispy onion strings, in a lettuce wrap. Grilled to perfection, and the fried green beans are bomb too.. I had to face a few. Also , they gave sriracha at the bar!!! Huge plus- but the best aside is their outrageous sauce. Don't forget to get some on the side!!"}
{"text":"Great Burger shop, very creative idea with infused burgers. I had the Mac N Cheese burger, nice juicy burger infused with bacon bits, fresh jalapeños and mac n cheese, also, on a brioche bun which had a special homemade spread. Great atmosphere, cool interior design, definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Come hungry caused you'll leave stuffed.  Very interesting rendition of a burger.   The staff are very friendly.   It's a great way to check out something different or just get full!"}
{"text":"The service was 10 stars!!! The staff all deserve kudos!

Cleanliness was 5 stars!!!

Quality of food... this is where they lost stars. Everything was incredibly greasy and truly lacked flavor. The stuffing in the burger is a good idea and was my favorite part... but there was something weird with the meat. It was an odd texture and flavor, definitely not my style. 

The sweet potato fries were greasy and bland. 

Everything was hot and freshly cooked, but not worth the price."}
{"text":"I was out partying in mesa last week and wanted to get some  gourmet burgers to go with  Ace of spades rosé champagne . What a great choice !!! This place has the best burgers !!!! The staff was great . The place was super clean  . We finished the food before the champagne . Crazy huh                      This is my new burger joint ! Thanks Yelp 
Thanks stufrageous !!"}
{"text":"The burger was excellent! I had the mac and cheese stuffed burger. Their sauce, which is on every burger and is great on the fries, is slightly spicy and OH YES. The fries were fantastic, especially with the sauce. The only issue was my chocolate shake, I always order a chocolate shake on my first trip to burger joints, which had a powdery taste and small pieces of ice in it. The first few sips were disappointing but from then on it was good. The service was also very good."}
{"text":"I ordered the jalapeño melt with bacon it was delicious and I got a vanilla milkshake with Oreos and strawberries.The workers we fantastic,the cashier was very nice she offered me a sample of their outrageous sauce with fries. I will for sure come back"}
{"text":"Discovered this place via UberEats app and a cool ASU promo that expired today. App was glitch and wouldn't allow us to check out. Called restaurant a s spoke with Manager on Duty who gave us a help number to call to remedy issue. UberEats told us to email our issue and they'd get back to us whenever. Not helpful. Tried calling MOD back but evidently she left at 7 pm. Guess we'll try this place some other time and hope they fix the app."}
{"text":"Outrageous sauce is amazing! Burgers are delicious and fries are seasoned perfectly! Give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We had a groupon for this location and the meal was not pricey as a result.  However, without the groupon I don't think I could afford this place for a family of 5.  That is the only thing holding this back from a 5 review.  Everyone really enjoyed their burger and the atmosphere is great too."}
{"text":"Wow. What a shock. Even with the positive reviews, you never really know. The food was ultra-yummy!  Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Best burger EVER!!  Everything is unique. The ground chicken burger stuffed with mushrooms, Swiss and basil was to die for!  Outrageous fries are a must!  You won't leave hungry that's for sure!!"}
{"text":"OMFG I \"accidentally\" found this place on here and man am I glad I did. Me and the wife split a jalapeño melt burger and a chicken greek burger both were amazing with the burger beating out the chicken slightly. Also had mac and cheese bites and the most amazing appetizer the tempura fries; These things are worth the drive from wherever you are to come and try the menu will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Just got done with my meal and it was great. The service here was excellent. They mistakenly gave us regular fries instead of sweet potato but before we finished our meal there were some extra sweet potato fries on our table. I had the Ruben burger and if you like Rubens you will really like this burger. My wife created her own and loved it. Tried the Mac and cheese bites as well, they were great. The prices are very reasonable and the service is fantastic. It is so rare to find good service at a burger joint. You can tell the the staff really does care and tries to make your experience enjoyable. They will even offer samples of you want to try something off the menu. Great place...we will be back."}
{"text":"Very good food. Perfectly cooked burger and the stuffings were amazing. The sweet potato fries are excellent and the dipping sauce is awesome. I wish there was one where I live in Colorado"}
{"text":"In a hurry to get dinner on our way to an event at MCC, we were trying to find something quick and close by the campus. Stufrageous sounded interesting, and to be honest we were mainly swayed by the ability to order online and have it ready quicker so we could make it on time for our event. We got there and the food was ready so fast that we ended up being able to eat there. It was a really clean and cool vibe with really neat looking exposed lightbulb fixtures with high tables and small booths. The food we ordered was really awesome! The burger was juicy, the fries were crispy and tastily seasoned, and the staff was very kind and helpful! Plus, the place is a Coke account which is a must for us! If we are ever looking for a bit nearby again, we will definitely come back! We are eager to build our own burger and try the different possibilities available!"}
{"text":"Really liked the flavor of the macaroni and cheese and the burger it was stuffed in.  Also liked the brioche bun from a nearby bakery.  The sauce has a good flavor and spice also.

Didn't like the chunks of jalapeno in the burger.  Thought they would be grilled or sauteed?!

Wasn't a huge fan of the green beans.  I like a lighter tempura batter.  It made me crave the ones from PF Changs.

Didn't like that they only iced tea was passion fruit flavor.  I like my tea just black.

Also, would have prefered root beer over the red cream soda in machine."}
{"text":"I met my niece, her mother, and family here for dinner since it was almost halfway between Midtown Phoenix and Chandler.  What a great place to have a fun dinner.  The burgers are well stuffed but not massive.  It would have been better if I hadn't eaten the whole thing but I was starving.  

My niece and I both had the three cheese stuffed burger.  Neither of us like cheeseburgers but having something between two layers of beef (or chicken) makes it taste very different.  

My sister - in -law had the Hawaiian and really enjoyed it.  My niece's husband enjoyed the mac and cheese stuffed burger.  

The fries were crisp and tasty.  The shakes are beautifully presented.  I didn't have dessert but everyone else enjoyed their ice cream in a variety of ways.  

It's definitely a place I'd return to.  If you live in or visit the Mesa area, add it to your list."}
{"text":"It's ok
We ordered 3 burgers
Marinara with pepperoni - was ok
The western with bacon and BBQ sauce was really good. 
The southwestern wasn't flavorful at all.

The loaded fries were excellent."}
{"text":"It's one of the best Burger I have ever eaten. I got Greek Burger stuffed with mushrooms, spinach, sundried tomatoes ( one of my favorite part) and of course feta cheese! My friend got the Hawaiian Burger with beef instead ham. Oh my gosh! It was phenomenal! We both liked and enjoyed our burgers. Probably each of us could eat another the second one. The burger was very juicy and the bread was very soft. I really like the way that they make different burgers then others. Thank you Jenna for the good burgers!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. I love the concept of stuffed burgers and was pleased with the results. I would have expected the burgers to have taken longer, but the food was very quick and HOT. I had the Jalapeño Melt with regular fries and a side of the Macaroni and Cheese Poppers. Everything was great! I tried the Outrageous sauce. It was very good for dipping my fries. A bit sweet and tangy and almost reminds me of a thousand island dressing with a bit more spice. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Love the stuffed burger concept, outrageous sauce is so delicious and service has been fantastic the 3 times I have been here so far."}
{"text":"Happy, positive staff and a cute, clean restaurant. A bit expensive at $10 per burger then there's sides. 
Save up your money and try it!
The fries and onion strings are perfectly cooked, seasoned and very delicious.
My husband got the BBQ stuffed and I built mine with jalapeños (very crispy and spicy), mushrooms and cheese. Burgers were small but fresh,  juicy and excellent flavor.
My biggest complaint is the condiments are on the side and they serve you the burger cut in half. You try to put half of a tomato slice and half of an onion piece and half of a piece of lettuce on a small, half of bun. Not easy and it slides off. Tough to eat.
Very tasty though!
We will be back but ask them not to pre-cut the burger."}
{"text":"Great concept, but it was a little complicated to try to figure out what I wanted.

Definitely delicious but it takes a few visits to find what you might like."}
{"text":"Stopped in last week...  The counter gal was friendly and helpful, rattled off the four burgers she'd had and what she thought of them.  My friend went with some italian burger....I forget what it was stuffed with but I know it came with some marianara...she said it was OK nothing too exciting.  She also had a side of sweet potato fries that she enjoyed.  I went all out....I had the mac & cheese stuffed burger.  For having that and bacon & jalapenos...I was disappointed it was....flavorless....I drown each bite in mayo...  Despite neither of us being impressed, we WILL go back.  They have an extensive menu so I'm sure we'll something to appeals to our palates.  Besides the food, friendly staff and cute comfy digs!!"}
{"text":"BETTER than SmashBurger!! I bought the Caprese  burger (stuffed with mozzarella cheese, basil, and tomato), hubby bought the three cheese burger (cheddar, mozzarella, and Swiss cheese), and we got a side order of the Mac and cheese bites for our little one. 

The fries come with a specialty sauce, I think it was their Outrageous sauce. We think it was a combo of Sriracha, ketchup, and mayo which is such a great idea... If it's not the ingredients, it was a great dipping sauce none-the-less. The Mac and Cheese bites come with marinara dipping sauce. I've never had these before, so it was an experience. I didn't really care too much about them by itself, but it was surprisingly better with the marinara. 

The burger was GREAT! That's all I can really say lol! So glad we found this joint, I'm sure we'll come back in the future whenever we're up in Mesa again."}
{"text":"All I can say is average.  Interesting concept, service was fine for fast casual fare but the burgers did not excite me.  My son had Mac and Cheese stuffed in his burger and I had the southwestern.  Basically the burger itself was flat.  I first look for flavor there and it was lacking.  My son liked his so it wasn't a total loss.  We also shared outrageous fries.  The order was huge but again, nothing special as all we had on it was cheese."}
{"text":"Okay so I was legitimately surprised by this place I wasn't sure what to expect especially after reading some of the reviews. But I decided to try it anyways and I'm
Definitely glad that I did. 

My experience 

I could tell from the outside that they were pretty busy so that was a good sign. 

Well The moment I walked in I was greeted by one of their employees which is always a plus and a nice gesture. I looked around and it was quite busy but even for them being busy the place was pretty clean. 
The area was quite big which you can't really tell from the outside. 

While I waited in line I began to look over the menu because I had no idea what I wanted to get and since you can pretty much customize everything I wasn't really sure what I wanted. When I finally got up to the register I explained to Jenna(the employee) that it was my 1st time stopping in and i was totally lost she was super friendly about it and broke it down, she also told me what was their best sellers and directed me to their signature burgers. 

I ended up getting the Greek burger and the fact that I could have it lettuces wrapped made it even better I also Ordered their sweet potato fries and took my number oh and I noticed if you check in you can get a regular drink as long as your purchase comes out to more then $8. I took my number and took a seat. the aroma of food was all over the place and made me super hungry.. haha 
It took about 10 minuets or so for my Order to come out.

Both the burgers and fries tasted amazing, the burger was a little messy looking but I have no actual complaints about either one. The Burger patty is pretty small but it's kinda expected due to the things you have to put in it.  

I'll definitely be returning to try out some more things on their menu."}
{"text":"Good quality burger and great service. I will come back. Hard to compete with In-N-Out prices tho. This place is a bit expensive, but fair prices."}
{"text":"I ordered from this business with Postmates. The order was 40 min late, and upon investigation it was discovered that they forgot to put in the order. When the Postmates driver got there, she was made to wait for the whole order to be made. I was late to work because of their error. Do not ever order from this business with a delivery service. 

Furthermore, even if the order has gone seamlessly, I would never order food from here ever again, simply because it was disgusting. Greasy, flavorless, carelessly put together. It reeks of of poor quality. The flavors just aren't there and none of these qualities justify the price point. Simply gross, we did not even eat it."}
{"text":"A great place to grab a burger. I particularly like the jalapeño popper or the southwest burger. The fried Mac and cheese bites are also great."}
{"text":"The burger was too mushy and tasted like the meat was out of a can. The fries were the only good thing of my meal. Sorry just disappointed."}
{"text":"Looking for different places to eat found a Groupon for this place, would've given 5 stars if the meat was better seasoned, but they have great combinations. We tried the burger with stuffed with Mac & cheese, the southern, I picked my own stuffings and it was cooked juicy and the stuffing tastes fresh. Service was very friendly as well. Will come back to try more combinations!"}
{"text":"Amazing stuffed burgers. I tried the Mac n cheese one and it was great. My boyfriend had a custom one with bacon and pepper jack and that was just as good. Really good fresh fries and friendly workers"}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss. Got the same burger on separate occasions and the first time was amazing, second was below average.  Fries come from a frozen bag. The staff is friendly. Just need to get consistency down."}
{"text":"Second visit.  My friend wanted to take me out to lunch and asked where I wanted to go. I said Stufrageous. The service was excellent and I had the Mac n cheese and my friend  had he Jalapeño popper with fries and onion strings. As before everything was delicious. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Don't order through Yelp because they will make it the time the order goes through not the time you schedule for pick up. I ordered at 3:30 and they made the food at that time, and they gave it to me at 5:20. Yes. They served me food that was sitting out for almost two hours. Beef sitting out for two hours. Luckily I have been burned by to go orders in the past and checked it in my car. The food was not warm at all. First impressions are everything and even though the manager had no hesitation to remake the order I still feel like this was extremely unsafe for a restaurant do."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here with the hubs. Had a great meal! Hubs got the caprese stuffed with mozarella, tomato, and basil. I had the ruban, not really a true ruban, but stuffed with pastrami and swiss. But on the brioche buns. It was awesome! The fries were great, crispy and tender inside. The restaurant itself was clean & not too busy on a Sunday afternoon. And the staff was super friendly and helpful. I look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"So if your debating on going to this place you need to go.  I ordered a burger stuffed with green chillies and Swiss , sweet potato fries and large drink and it was $10. 
It took a little bit to get my burger but when I did it was awesome. The burger was cook perfect. Not sure if they season the burgers or it's just really good meat. They have a secret sauce that is good too. If the owner wanted to put one of these in surprise I would be the first to invest."}
{"text":"This place has the option to use chicken instead of beef, which is awesome.  Most of their food is extremely over priced. It also takes an eternity to actually get your order also. Not my favorite, and probably will eat in-n-out or Johnny's over this place"}
{"text":"This is the BEST burger spot in Az. It's extremely delicious. The place is clean and has great customer service. I live 40 min away and it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"We came out to Stufrageous tonight.  I had the jalapeño popper chicken burger & my nine year old son had the Caprese beef burger.   The burgers are delicious!!  We didn't put any extra condiments on the burgers, they were great as is.  

The fries were good, and go great with the Homemade Outrageous Sauce!   

We were pretty stuffed from the burgers and sharing a fries.  We didn't have room for dessert, maybe next time?  

The guy(Cristian) at the front was very helpful and his service was great!  You gotta try them out!"}
{"text":"Best way to enjoy a bun less burger!! 

 My husband was craving a burger tonight so we decided to check this place out.  I had the Greek burger...uhmazeballs! So much flavor!  I don't eat the bun so it was nice to have all the yummy toppings in between the patties.

My husband had the three cheese burger with bacon added and French fries.  The fries came out fresh and hot!  He said burger was great and seasoned just right.

Cashier was friendly and place was clean.  Next time burgers call our name we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Thanks for the sarcastic and condescending response. I get it. You think I'm one of those who gave you a bad review for no reason. But if you read my other reviews, you'll see that I call it as I experience it. That's the only thing I can do and that can be expected of me.   We waited nearly 30 minutes for our order that day. And the \"stuff\" inside the burger tasted stale and awful. The ketchup tasted watered down. These are facts about my experience. You can argue back all you want but this IS what happened! There are some great restaurants that I have visited and your place just isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Since this was my first visit to Stufrageous, I decided to go with a basic single patty cheeseburger (cheddar cheese instead of American) for $4.99 and a plain chocolate shake for $2.99. I wanted to taste the quality of the beef, not just stuff stuffed inside of a burger. The beef patty was about the same quality as a Culver's butterburger, a little better than Smashburger, but not nearly as good as Johnny's (formerly Lobbys). You have your choice of buns--sesame seed, whole wheat, brioche, or a lettuce wrap. I went with whole wheat but would definitely chose the brioche if I went with a juicier stuffed burger. The chocolate shake was OK, but again not as good as the Bryer's ice cream shakes at Johnny's.

Service was odd. When I requested some napkins, I was presented with a wad of paper towels instead of pointing me to the drink station where the napkins are kept. You order at a counter and the food is brought to you--like Carl's Jr. except this place has a tip jar on the counter (I don't think I have seen that at Carl's Jr. type fast food places before). I was asked if I wanted whipped cream on my shake. I asked if it was real whipped cream or just the fake topping some places use. The counter person looked confused and didn't know. I said OK, but it was the yucky artificial topping, not real whipped cream.

Overall, I am giving this place 3.5 stars (I don't have that option, so rounded up to 4 stars). If I get a hankering for a burger in the future, I will probably just drive down the street to Johnny's."}
{"text":"Clean and neat restaurant with a friendly staff. Burgers have a unique stuffing combination with interesting flavors and textures. The Mac N Cheese side dish is a bit pricey at $5 and too large for one person.  This menu item is best suited when shared with another person or for a larger appetite. The wait time after I placed my order was more than 15 minutes. If you're alone and bored, be sure to ask for the Wi-Fi password before giving up your place in line. Going online will help to pass the time while they prepare your made to order burger.  There is also good background music if you happen to like EDM.  :)"}
{"text":"I visit Stufrageous as often as possible! The concept is fantastic and they execute it almost without flaw! I do wish the patties were a little bigger, as the stuffing often comes through the bottom. 

The stuffing options are fantastic and you are insane if you pass up the pepper jack mac and cheese bites!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Mac n Cheese burger and the fries with outrageous sauce when I visited on April 17, 2015. Customer service was outstanding! I shall return on my next visit to Phoenix"}
{"text":"The burgers are delicious!! I stopped in after driving by several times just to give it a try, and I am very impressed. I got the blue cheese and bacon burger, and it was overstuffed. The filing was spilling out as I ate. This will definitely be in my lunch rotation going forward."}
{"text":"i've only had the mac & cheese burger and that's probably what i'll be ordering for a very long time as it's delicious. i think the fries could be better but overall still good with their dipping sauce. faby is my fav worker, very friendly"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! The burger was hand crafted. I got the Mac and Cheese stuffed burger and couldn't be happier. I got it with the ground chicken this time and to be honest I didn't miss the beef too much. Their fries and in house sauce is also delicious. Next time I will try their Mac and cheese bites. This place is about 30 minutes drive from my house but I found it to be incredibly valuable and extremely filling. I left this place more satisfied than my last few times at Red Robin. I will definitely be back again sometime soon."}
{"text":"Tried Stufrageous for the first time today and I Loved It. I had the Southwestern Stuffed Burger on a Brioche Bun plus a side of Pepper Jack Mac and Cheese bites. The burger was delicious  but oh that Mac and Cheese. I will return, there are more burgers to try and many more orders of the Mac and Cheese to be consumed."}
{"text":"I am a big guy and enjoy a good burger. This place was not good. You couldn't taste the meat in the burger I didn't like the wait time. The staff seemed not to care. The restaurant was too small. Only thing my wife and I liked were the fries."}
{"text":"Priced right around $7-11 per person, depending on sides and drinks. Very friendly staff, clean and quick. Will come again! Gluten- free friendly :)"}
{"text":"This was our first time going here. Great experience. Restaurant was clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. French fries were fresh and yummy. Price was reasonable. We were a group of 4 adults and all of us liked our food. The only complaint from anyone was they wished the burger was a little bigger. Definitely a fun place to try that is a little out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Got to the listed location and they had already closed and moved out??  So I have No idea what their food is like??"}
{"text":"The food was better the 1st time around. This time was more stuff than rageous.   Wasnt satisfied at all with the mac n cheese burger sweet potato fries were burnt. 2nd order of fries werent cooked all the way."}
{"text":"Lunch with a coworker on a Saturday. He ordered mushroom stuffed burger and ultimate fries.  I ordered chicken stuffed with Greek and regular fries.  Both our fries were good.  He commented his burger was bland and not impressed within two bites and not very hot. I was less then enthralled by my chicken stuffed and covered with the zesty sauce stuff.  Chicken texture reminded me of frozen ground chicken and what I was served was not exactly hot either in temperature.  We did get good service and the place got busy just after we had ordered.. It won't make our Saturday lunch rotation and we both agreed upon that before finishing the first half burger we were each eating."}
{"text":"The cheddar mac n' cheese bites have blown my mind. If I had any part of my brain left, I would most certainly use it to let you know how much I enjoyed the food from Stufrageous Stuffed Burgers. The outrageous sauce is phenomenal. It is tangy, sweet, with a little spicy kick and goes smashingly with the tempura green beans, which are a nice alternative to typical fries. Don't worry, they have the staple French Fries too. Along with delicious Sweet Potato Fries as well! 

I had a chicken burger stuffed Capresse style. The flavor was on point between the tomato, basil and mozzarella. Next, I tired the Hawaiian. It has a whole pineapple slice stuffed inside that added a scrumptious juicy flavor to the burger. Also, I super appreciate the fact that they have a not forgotten to have a veggie burger and it is equally as tasty. 

Note: The Veggie Burger is not stuffed. I would suggest adding cheese on to it if you are not vegan. 

The customer service was wonderful. The staff was so friendly, help, informative, and delightful. The establishment is clean and inviting and the lighting is certainly fun. With an open kitchen you get to watch as your food is made right before you. Thus, giving your extra confidence in the the quality of the product you receive. 

I look forward to my next visit. Mac n' Cheese stuffed burger you are all mine!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing concept \"Stuffed Burgers\"...I had a Spinach & Red Onion stuffed Burger and it was phenomenal. I really enjoed the experience and it was truly an experience, there are no words to describe the Fries not Fried...but they were delicious.....I will return.... Give it a try."}
{"text":"Stood at the register for 10min while none of the employees acknowledged we were even there or said hello so we left. Was excited to try but won't be back.

Our Visit was April 2nd around 11:40."}
{"text":"This place is bomb, me and my wife love going here ever since it opened up, if you like trying new spots try this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Tasted like a good cheap nasty burger.  Fries were good too.

We felt gross afterward.  She crashed and I walked around like a zombie.

Update: I ate the other half of the burger the next day and had the runs again 4 hours later for the rest of the day.  This is bad stuff.  Unsanitary food.  So I am reducing rating from 4-stars to 1."}
{"text":"First time at Stufrageous and I must say the food was amazing! Everything served hot..the fries/tempura green beans and sauce are my new fav! MacNcheese in my burger, i never thought could mix so perfectly! Above all else the service was so friendly and very welcoming..my new fav burger spot thank you Stufrageous for a great lunch/experience."}
{"text":"It was ok. I didn't like the sauce. If I'm hungry and in the area I would eat here, but I wouldn't go out of my way"}
{"text":"This was good.  Fast food, good good good. I mean it, go check it out.  Clean, fast, terrific."}
{"text":"Great place and ambiance the outrageous fries were simply amazing !!!!! I would definitely come back just for those bad boys!!!!"}
{"text":"Was in town looking for a good burger and found on Yelp. It was a great burger. Placing the topping inside was awesome. I had the pastrami burger and it was fantastic. Takes a while to cook fresh, but that is what is best right?"}
{"text":"My first time eating here. I had the three cheese stuff burger. The stuffing was great, the cheese had that perfect pull to it like pizza made with quality mozzarella. The fries are good especially with the sauce. The only two down sides were the beef used for the burger isnt great. Not sure if they are using cheap beef or just not seasoning enough. The second issue was the time it took to get my food. Was one of only two guests at the time and other party already had food. Still took around 20 min to get my order. At this point I'm not sure if I will try them again or not."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim and was no disappointed.  Burgers were phenomenal, fries were perfect, and the staff were helpful and courteous.  Try their strawberry milkshake!  So tasty!"}
{"text":"As I sit at my desk devouring a mac and cheese stuffed hamburger that was brought to me by a co-worker who shall now be referred to as Hamburger Jesus, I am crying tear of burger salvation. Whoever decided to bless our area with this divine concept should be awarded the Nobel prize for culinary triumph. 

But really - if you think the idea of a stuffed burger is good - and getting that stuffed burger for an incredibly reasonable price is even better - this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Holy cow! I wasn't expecting good food, good price and a spotless place! Usually one is lacking but this place is on point! Try the Mac n cheese burger and an Oreo shake. There fries are great, likely due to the crystal clear grease. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I was searching for a place to go eat lunch. I am up here in the Mesa area for the annual AZ State Fire School. Well I came across this place as I was Yelping for places to eat... 

The food was great, the place was clean and the staff were nice and helpful guiding me to my lunch selection. My lunch.. Stuffed Chicken Greek burger.. Has mushrooms, spinach, sundried tomoatoes & feta cheese. The fries are outrageous fries.. Has cheddar, bacon and the outrageous sauce.! 

Lots of food, I had to get a to go box to take the left overs..! I think I may be back to this place before my training is over.!! The food is definitely worth the trip.

There wasn't many people when I went and I found out that they have delivery available or you can order your food on-line to have it ready when you arrive..! Boom.! That's a plus..!"}
{"text":"Really great lunch stop! Had the BBQ MOS and husband had Caprese. Super good stuffing. Great fries. Outrageous sauce was awesome. Everything was fresh. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is outrageously good! They just get everything right, from their burgers, to their sides, to their desserts and milkshakes. I've never had a stuffed burger before, and this restaurant exceeded my expectations! They can stuff your beef or chicken burger with cheese, veggies, or Mac and cheese (HEAVENLY)! The Mac and cheese bites and green bean tempura are fantastic and a must try when you stop in. And did I mention their signature Stufrageous sauce? I thought I would need ranch and ketchup to dip my fries, but after tasting their sauce, I didn't touch any other kind! Although it may seem impossible, try and save some room for their baked cookie with vanilla ice cream, or a unique milkshake!! The staff were very friendly and patient with my group who needed sometime to look at the epic menu.. the service is fast and the interior is trendy and clean. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting AZ!"}
{"text":"I tried this place on the fly...what a great choice definitely if your looking for something different"}
{"text":"Pretty not bad. Not great, though. Their fries were not good. The concept (kind of like the midwest's juicy Lucy) is good, but somehow the burgers seem dry, even with melting cheese in the middle of it. The burgers are well done, almost crispy. I'd try it again, but there are a million great burger places out there. Try it for yourself."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I didn't stop by here earlier, This place is Awesome! Me and my wife went for dinner about a week ago and we both ordered the MacNCheese Stuffed Burger. And it was one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life! Especially when my wife is not a big burger eater but she even insisted that we go back the very next day because she was craving it lol! The staff were welcoming and very patient due to us being first-timers :) thanks for giving us such amazing food and service!"}
{"text":"Upon my arrival at this new burger restaurant the staff seemed very friendly and happy. They greeted me within the first 3 seconds of me walking through the door, which I saw as a plus. Now let's talk about food, I ordered a jalepeño bacon Mac n' Cheese stuffed burger and I will tell you it was one of the best burgers I've ever had. It came out so juicy and oozing with the hot jalepeños bacon mac n' cheese on a freshly tasted bun. And for dessert DO NOT FORGET the soft warm chocolate chip or macadamia nut cookie topped with ice cream and your choice of sweet condiments. When I left this establishment I felt that I was very satisfied and you could say I was \"Stuffed.\" I will a sure you that this will NOT be the last time I eat here!"}
{"text":"Perfect little joint for your cheat day!  just waiting on a tasty Southwestern burger stuffed with green chilies and cheddar cheese on a brioche bun with a side of fries, tempura green bean fries and a strawberry shake! Ohh yah!"}
{"text":"the worst burger i've ever had... we asked if the jalapeños in the mac and cheese burger were spicy, and she said no not at all. We asked for low-heat jalapeños just to be safe. the first bite I had burned my mouth, and it was the spiciest thing I have ever had. so painful. and I actually love spicy food. BUT NOT TO THE POINT WHERE I CANT EAT IT. the meat was terrible, and the fries tasted like freezer food. don't go here.

the owner justin s. just messaged me and told me i was an idiot. great display of ownership. i will recommend this place for sure now! thanks justin!"}
{"text":"Great burger place in town, the only thing I have problem is that the portion is kinda big. But definitely one of the best burger in town."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Fergie - Fergalicious)

Four, tres, two, uno
Listen up you all, 'cause this is it
The place that I'm reviewing is delicious

Stufrageous definition make them boys go loco
They want my burgers so they get their pleasures from my menu
You could eat it, you can stuff it
It's so easy, it's not greasy
It's got reasons why I eat 'em
Orders come and go with stuffings

Stufrageous (so delicious)


Stufrageous is an adaptation of a Juicy Lucy; but aside from cheese you can stuff it with other ingredients like Basil, Jalapenos, etc....

For sides, my buddies ordered fries and fried greenbeans.  For entree, he went with the Hawaiian and I shot for the jalapeno melt.  I'd like to start with the fries; nice and crispy to the bite and fresh from the fryer so quite hot!  The greenbeans were done just right; totally dig the crisp and crunch of the breading and the beans.  Both items was served a mayo/siracha combo sauce; nicely done indeed!

My buddies Hawaiian was stuffed with pineapple, ham, mozzarella cheese and my Jalapeno Melt was stuffed with American & Pepperjack cheese, and jalapeno.  Both served with their Outrageous sauce.  You have options on the bun whether a Wheat or Brioche.  The burgers itself was pretty small compared to many burgers that I was used to, but I didn't fret about it much.  I picked the Brioche bun with mines.  Overall, I enjoyed the burger; the cheese was oozy and the crunch of the jalapeno brought the texture.

In the end, I thought it was a great idea; which makes me wonder, what took so long!?   The fries and fried greenbeans were definitely my favorite, but needless to say the burgers were darn good too.  For a fast food joint this place really makes burgers taste less fast food like and more Stufrageously good! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! We were at a local water park today and took a break to get some food. We looked up burger joints within a couple of miles from the park and this place came up. All I can say is WOW! They had four choices of buns, ground beef or chicken burgers STUFFED with your choice of cheeses and veggies and the most incredible \"outrageous\" fries you have ever had! The outrageous part is their special sauce they pour over the fries. To die for! The staff was incredibly pleasant, food came out fast and was made exactly how we requested. Even our beef, egg, and milk allergic 12 year old got exactly what he wanted!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Third time here and it has got me addicted. Of course when you let me get a fried egg on top of my burger  you're doing it right. The Mac and cheese bites are out of this world, and best of all it's right down the street for me."}
{"text":"For a fast food burger joint this place was awesome. First, we ordered online and completely customized not only our burgers but our fries as well.  The online ordering is SO EASY and I honestly think it's easier that calling or going in. 

We ordered two burgers, the Mac and cheese and the BBQ- both were awesome and both were huge.  We loved the outrageous sauce, not sure what it was but it was spicy and delicious I was dipping everything in it.  We also ordered a basket of regular fries and a basket of outrageous fries.  That was the only mistake we made- we had no idea how big the baskets were! We definitely could have shared a side order of one or the other, we didn't need both and we didn't eat all of either, so that's something to think about.  We had enough food in front of us to feed a family of 6.  

I would definitely go back and eat at the restaurant, but they make it so easy to order, pay online, and pick it up in 15 minutes, it was a perfect quick fix when we had nothing planned for dinner."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place every time I drive by. WOOHOO it was delicious!!  Came on a good day, every Wednesday its Free fries. Staff was friendly and helpful with the menu. I am boring and order a burger with bacon and pepper jack cheese along with their yummy sauce. Yummy sauce has a little heat and the burger was super juicy. Husband ordered the Hawaii burger and he loved it.  Next time I will try the stuffed mac N' cheese inside. Defiantly worth the $$."}
{"text":"The outrageous sauce is outrageously delicious. Cool concept. I mistakenly thought the chicken burger was a chicken breast when in fact its a ground chicken patty...delicious mistake I might add."}
{"text":"Omg this is amazing, just got my food and love it. What a great idea, I tried the caprese with chicken on whole wheat bun, real mozzarella!! The fries are delicious, and bonus they have bottled beer :)"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, burgers both chicken and beef were amazing! Great concept! Kid portions were huge. Juicy burgers, soft choice of bun (loved the brioche), and sides were plenty! We would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend around 11am. Place was pretty empty - only one other party there.

Got the Ruben which was good but it was very heavy. I didn't think it was that special."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, got a lot of smiles. Clean inside. the only drawback would be they only have a Pepsi machine with Pepsi products with some Lipton tea on the side. Very delicious burgers and awesome fries with a Chipotle mayo house-made sauce that is awesome! (Pictured). I got the pepperoni pizza burger (pictured) and was pretty tasty (4.5/5 rating on burger alone). 

Will come back and definitely spread the good word!i"}
{"text":"Amazing burger place love the house sauce and mac and cheese burger! Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"If you have not tried this place... Go! Now! You will be impressed!!! You guys... my husband dragged me here, and I was certain it would be a disappointment. Boy was I wrong. SO DELICIOUS! I've never been a huge fan of stuffed burgers, but I guess that's because I've never had one done RIGHT. They do it right! I seriously sound like they paid me to write this, but they didn't. I just really, really love this place. The Stufrageous sauce is amazing. I want to drink it. Their fries are perfect. Their burgers!! I have not tried one I didn't like. The Reuben burger is my favorite I think (sounds weird, but don't knock it till you've tried it!!!). The jalapeno popper burger is also excellent. So is the mac n' cheese burger. Seriously, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out because of all the good reviews, and I agree, this place is worth it! You start by choosing either beef or chicken and then you choose what you want stuffed into your Patty. They have some signature burgers or you can create your own. I went with the Greek my husband got the mac and cheese jalapeno burger. Then you get to choose a bun including a lettuce wrap. The fries are ridiculously tasty! And they give you a good portion. For 2 Burgers, two fries, and two drinks, it was $22.
The service is very friendly! The lady at the counter didn't mind answering any questions and making quite a few great suggestions. She was not at all frustrated that we were there for the first time and didn't have a clue about the menu. The food takes a bit to come out but it's obviously because they are freshly made to order, very worth it.
We will definitely be back! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I've read about this place several times and finally decided to indulge my burger cravings. What drew me was the creativity and variety of burger with \"stuffing\", and I was not disappointed. They have a call ahead option which I decided to take them up on because I brought along two of my little ones. The food was ready when I got there (which was nice) and we sat down to enjoy. If you enjoy a really good burger, this one is a little lacking in the meat department, unless you get an extra patty. But again, Macaroni and cheese, jalapeños all inside my burger...yep, sign me up! Some other good choices on the menu including their fantastic, made to order shakes. Even though not a full-service restaurant, the customer service was a little rocky. The tables weren't clean when we got there and I had to ask in order for them to clean them. They had forgotten to give me all of our drinks and they weren't very friendly. 4 stars only for the food."}
{"text":"Hamburgers being my very favorite, I am always in line for the next great Hamburger. Unfortunately, this is not it, at least for me, based on one experience and I will NOT have another here.

Specifically:

Sweet Potato Fries - unfortunately, soggy and greasy

Tempura Green Beans - AWFUL! Hard fried and cold when we got 
 them, definitely NOT Tempura batter

French Fries - Excellent, but far too much salt

Burger - The \"Stuffing\" was too little to be of any consequence and I 
had Blue Cheese, so with a proper amount should have been a 
taste treat. The quality of the meat was excellent although very small 
burger and the Brioche Bun was very good.

Service - excellent

Price - $35 for Burger and a side each (no drinks, just water) for three was way too much for the quality and size (lack of) of the burger

Freddy's doesn't have to worry."}
{"text":"Was vacationing in az this past weekend and was staying across the street from here. The front desk at the hotel recommended we have dinner here and boy was it amazing! Never have I heard of a place like this. I had the jalapeño melt chicken burger and the Mac n cheese bites. They were out of this world!! And their house sauce was so delicious! I can't wait to come back to Arizona just for this place! We need a Stufrageous in Michigan!"}
{"text":"Place had a lot of hype to it. Thought it was gonna be good, but it was okay. The fries however, were the best part. But the burgers was okay, it not my kind of burgers but that doesn't mean it's not good for someone else. I got the b.c. and c burger which was stuffed with blue cheese, and it was pretty overwhelming"}
{"text":"So disappointing. 

First, the bun. I lived in Paris for the winter of 2001 and as a former chef, became very familiar with French cuisine. Their Brioche bun is NOT a brioche bun, and this just plain gets my blood boiling. Don't tell me I'm getting brioche and then give me a regular bun with a touch more egg in it, if it even has egg in it at all. Brioche is special, the bun here is not Brioche. End of story. 

I wanted it to-go. They don't put salad on the burger, some asked them to put it on the burger. Instead, it was put into a plastic sandwich bag. I freaking kid you not, see photo. So I had a bun with a stuffed patty. What did they expect me to do with that salad, assemble my own burger in the car? 

For this alone you're getting a very deserved one star. 

The taste of the burger was good. Nothing to complain about, but remember, there's no salad on the burger to compete with the meat flavor. 

Then there's the fries. I ordered the stuffed sweet potato fries with mushrooms, bacon, cheddar and blue cheeses. WHERE'S THE CHEESE?? If I pay for two different cheeses, I'm expecting a half-decent amount of cheese. The cheddar was basically missing, and the blue cheese quality was awful. The fries themselves are a soggy mess. Not cooked nearly enough. I asked for sauce in the fries, nope, no sauce. It's included in little containers in the bag. 

Ack, this is such a bad review and I know it. I can only play with the hand I was dealt though. 

It gets worse. The to-go bag was stapled shut so I could not see what was in it before leaving. That's a clue!! I opened it and there were no napkins, and no fork for eating the loaded fries. Do they expect people to eat soggy sweet potato fries with their fingers? 

It baffles me how they have a single 5 star review."}
{"text":"Great stuffed burgers.  Ground chicken option is great for a red meat alternative!  Fries are crispy and seasoned perfectly.  The outrageous sauce is spicy, but you can get it on the side."}
{"text":"This burger joint is amazing! Went here for lunch not knowing what to expect. Left wanting to go back for dinner. Best burger and frys I've had in a long time. The frys were so good!! If you are looking for somewhere new this is certainly the place to go!"}
{"text":"Average prices for below average food. Patronize if you have some money that should go to charity and if you aren't too hungry."}
{"text":"Such a great experience! Tonight was our first time and it was delicious. The best part of our visit was by far the employees. The guy working tonight was so nice I wish I would have caught his name. He entertained my daughter and asked if she wanted to watch him make her milkshake. The shakes are so good!! Will definitely return. Prices are cheap for the huge flavorful burgers!"}
{"text":"I was intrigued by the \"stuffed\" burger so decided to give it a shot. I wish I hadn't. I got the crowd favorite, Mac n cheese stuffed burger. There was virtually no flavor from the Mac n cheese. It's like watered down cheese sauce and soggy pasta shells. Maybe I ordered the wrong burger but I was greatly underwhelmed. You're better off going to Shake Shack."}
{"text":"Favorite burger place in town hands down! I was greeted with great service. I had the Mac N Cheese burger by far the best burger I've ever had along with there French fries. I would definitely give it a try. Overall it was outrageously delicious!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place.  Service was good and friendly and helpful.  Burger was not my type.  Great that they have so many stuffable options but love the crusty carmelization that can happen on the outside of a burger.  This burger lacked that plus just didn't taste really meaty."}
{"text":"SOOO GOOOOD!! Found this on yelp and had to come try it. I had the reuben stuffed burger, while the boyfriend had the BBQ one with mushrooms, onion, & swiss (I think it was called the MOS). We both loved them! The fries are amazing. I can't even imagine what anyone is talking about with limp fries unless they got them to go or delivered and sat in a steamy container for a while. These fries are completely legit! Crispy - almost like they have a light batter on them. Definitely give their outrageous sauce a try - spicy sweet! I loved it, but the boyfriend didn't - mostly because he doesn't do much spicy at all. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy  

Positives:
Two words.. \"outrageous sauce\".  Yes.  I'm a sauce kinda gal and this one hits the spot. I'm not sure what's in it but it has a slight kick to it with a wonderful flavor.  You can order it with your fries or also on your burger.  I will take both please. Now for the burger... when I think of a stuffed burger so many things come to mind.  Mostly just a big fat burger with yumminess stuffed inside.  Well my friends, I do believe you can find that here!  I ordered the BBQ burger, my daughter the pastrami burger and the hubby got the 3 cheese.  I thought he was kinda crazy for just getting cheese stuffed? Why do just cheese when they offer so much more right?  Wrongggggggg!!!   Although the other burgers were great with what they used.. the 3 cheese was the only one that was oozing with what I would think of as the perfect stuffed burger. 

So as you can see, I suggest the 3 cheese burger with the bigger sized patty. If you want to try one of the others.. I would consider asking if they could add extra cheese! 

The restaurant was clean and decorated nicely. The staff were very helpful and kind. It was overall a great dinner. Thumbs up 

Negatives:
I don't so much have any negative comments but I do suggest the bigger meat patty as well as the 3 cheese."}
{"text":"Had to see what all the hype was about this place. They have a Groupon offer so I bought it and today was the day to give this place a try. They have really friendly employees and some cool options for stuffing burgers. The girl who took our order was very friendly and she offered the special sauce right out of the gate so that we can try it. We ordered a mac & cheese burger as well as a jalapeño popper burger. Of course we upgraded our burgers to meals. They had red cream soda in the place of what is normally root beer so that was kind of cool. The order didn't take very long to complete. Our fries came out first and they brought us a side of their special sauce to dip it in. There's also ketchup, mayonnaise and mustard available. Fries were good but they weren't good on their own. The burgers came out next and I ordered mine protein style. The burger is a bit smaller in comparison to other burger joints. The flavor was OK but nothing really stood out and grabbed you. 

If you're looking for a phenomenal tasting beef burger then keep searching. If you want the experience of a stuffed burger then give this place a try."}
{"text":"The staff here was great! Came on a Friday afternoon with 12 people. None of us have been here, they offered us a sample of their sause with fries. After we all ordered the food came out within 15 min. The staff also offered us the cookie icecream stuff to try. Highly suggest trying it!!"}
{"text":"Been here almost half a dozen times and I love it. Had one bad experience, but they repaid me with the exact same meal on the house! Customer service is always phenomenal and the food is even better! I've recommended this place to everyone I know and I suggest you do the same!!"}
{"text":"The only slightly negative thing I have to say is the wait time for our food was a tad bit long, especially with only a single family in front of us waiting on their food. With that out of the way, I really liked Stufrageous. The outrageous fries were definitely a hit. They weren't overpriced, and the sauce was tangy with a sweet side to it. I ordered the bacon blue cheese burger which had the perfect amount of blue cheese, although I could have done with a little more bacon. For dessert we tried the macadamia nut cook with ice cream and strawberries. The cookie was doughy and warm. I split everything in half with my boyfriend and it still filled us up for a little under 15 dollars. Will be going back."}
{"text":"I went here on a glowing review from another patron who was ecstatic about the burger. When I walked in I was expecting a surprise in quality from what on the surface looks like a novelty. And I did get a surprise

I got the Mac and cheese stuffed burger, cheese and beef. What's not to like?  But while the fries were definitely great and the service was good too, the burger left me much to be desired. It had a poor texture and an almost total lack of taste. I couldn't taste anything but milky weak cheese and jalapeño after my first bite. It was a bitter disappointment. I was expecting an experience like Smashburger at least, instead it was more like Red Robin (another mediocre \"gourmet burger\")

If you want mac and cheese or pepperoni pizza stuffed in your burger, go ahead, but not if you are expecting anything above average."}
{"text":"Maybe the Brioche isn't a true Brioche, but the mac & cheese burger that I had was awesome. The service was friendly and very good. They gave me some of their special dipping sauce for my burger or fries without me even asking for it.  The girl that helped me came out and packed up the condiments that I had taken out while waiting for my order and put them in the bag.  They have real brewed China mist Iced tea.  The place was clean during lunch time.  For me the burger was great, the service was great, they get five stars."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero stars I would. After my wife wrote a bad review for this place he told her that she was an idiot and dumb. The Reuben burger was gross and the fries were gross as well. The lady at the front was snappy and obviously the owner has some issues going after people on a Saturday night while he should be working on how to make his Reuben taste better. 
I can see how people like this place and I was going to give it another try but after the owner cyber bullied my wife I will never go back."}
{"text":"Could be the best burger in town! Like nothing else! It is not a convenient location, but it is well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I do have to say that the burgers here are amazingly good! The service was awesome, they were very inviting! MUST GO BACK"}
{"text":"The cashier came off as impatient, maybe she didn't realize not everyone comes in knowing exactly what they want. Fries were alright, I personally found their outrageous sauce disgusting but rest of family seemed to like it. Was a little disappointed at first by burger size  (had fantasies of a burger big as my head) but the taste is amazing. Great seasoning on the burger. Had the southwestern which was tasty. Wife had the Greek which had a nice flavor. My kid had a Hawaiian which also had a nice unique flavor. Overall good stuff, I'll be back for the variety alone"}
{"text":"Really good! Portion size was perfect! Great different combos of hamburgers! Staff super friendly. We were the only ones in there and it took awhile for them to make 3 burgers. What if there were more people.  A definite referral.  Will go again for sure!"}
{"text":"YUM!  Definitely worth the few extra minutes to cook the stuffed burgers.  There are many \"stuffed\" options as well as sides to choose from.  I think you can pre-order for pick up which may be a good option if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"A good hamburger with a funky twist: instead of toppings, you get stuffings. Yes, that's right. The stuff that usually goes on top is stuffed in the middle.
There's only a downside if you're OCD and want each bite to have evenly distributed toppings :-(
I had a mushroom onion swiss burger."}
{"text":"YES! SO MUCH YES!

My inner (and outer) fat kid is so excited at the idea of anything stuffed. I did a stuff your own with three kinds of cheese. So worth the calories. My husband had the Hawaiian and loved it, too! Their fries and mac and cheese were also delicious. Next time we are in the area we will definitely be back. AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I came in one day when the restaurant was just opening for the day. The employees welcomed us in even though they weren't quite open yet and let us have a seat and look over the menu until they were ready for us. All of us were BEYOND satisfied with our food, the service,  the whole experience from beginning to the end. The place was spotless (granted they just opened) but it was very comfortable and welcoming. We were greeted and helped by the manager Jenna. She was awesome. She made sure we were all taken care of and happy. She answered every question we had and delivered the most fresh food I've ever tasted at a \"fast food\" restaurant.  I HIGHLY recommend this place to any and everyone looking for fresh well made food that is not your ordinary burger and fries. Thank you stufragous for your wonderful hospitality and awesome food! Will DEFINITELY be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! The food is delicious and it's actually not bad pricing. My total bill was about 15 dollars but that includes fries, drink, and dessert. That's a great deal!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with a co-worker. Walked up to order and let the cashier know that it would be a moment because it was our first time. They were super friendly and offered us some of the outrageous sauce and some fries to try it out. I found the outrageous sauce to be a little too spicy but it had a nice taste. Burgers were delicious, I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"We've ordered these little numbers a couple of times from Uber Eats, and they're delicious.   These guys are definitely not mailing it in and flipping average burgers.   I got the Jalapeno Melt both times and they were delicious.   

Give em a try!   Careful, you might like em."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to try something different for lunch on the way home from church. Yelp brought up this place and we decided to try it out. 

Really delicious! It's a very different take on the burger- so be prepared for a place that serves them completely differently than normal. 

They stuff their burgers. This means exactly what you think it does. And yes it works! They cut their burgers in half and serve them almost like hotdogs, serving the fixings on the side so you can assemble them to whatever style you'd prefer. 

Their signature outrageous sauce is pretty good. 

They bring out the fries to your table before the burger, treating them like appies which is kinda fun. However, it is a very salty meal, whichever option you go with, so be prepared for a very fast food tribute!

Would go again!"}
{"text":"This is the best jalapeno Jack stuffed burger I have had to date! I have now eaten at this restaurant 20 times since they opened... and must I mention the Ice cream shakes and fried macaroni wedges!   The place always has great service and is kept clean!"}
{"text":"Good not great.  Don't know what else to say.  I would not avoid going there with someone that is a fan, just not my first choice."}
{"text":"The burgers are pretty good and their fries are awesome BUT IT IS SO HOT IN HERE!! The thermostat was set to 90 degrees and with the heat from the kitchen it was easily 95+. Couldn't even finish eating my meal because it was so uncomfortably hot in there. Hopefully it was a problem with the AC because I can't imagine that they always have it set to this on purpose."}
{"text":"This place gets one star because of the good burgers. Customer service is cringey and being a customer feels almost like an inconvenience to these guys/their team members. So many dirty looks when picking up my order, when politely asking for a side of their stuffrageous sauce (by the way this was before I even said which type of sauce) the team member literally walks away in the middle of my question almost annoyed and instinctively grabs the sauce. Nothing energetic or friendly about how she did it. Painful, buyer beware that you don't ask the wrong questions, you'll feel the cringe"}
{"text":"Sweet potato chips are so good! Very fresh!  We got a Hawaii burger and a Greek burger, pretty good! Staff are nice and friendly! Place is simple and clean."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an amazing Burger whether it be chicken or beef, with almost anything you can imagine in or on it... This is the place. Food is always fresh, it's family-friendly, and you get free fries on Wednesday with any stuffed burger purchase... Not to mention, the staff here are absolutely amazing. From the cooks all the way up to the owner... you will always get great customer service, smiles, and a \"have a nice day\" when leaving."}
{"text":"OMG! To die for!!!!!! The best damn burger I have ever eaten! I brought my kids here. I had the lettuce wrapped burger stuffed with pepper jack, bacon, and mushroom! Even without the bun, I was in complete heaven!!! 

Wednesday is free fries day and I didn't have the fries but my kids loved them and loved the fry sauce.  
Prices were reasonable.  What I would normally pay.  
The staff was quick, friendly and the place was cute. My only complaint, toooooop far from my house ! I'll be back!!  ,"}
{"text":"This place is REALLY unique. I've never seen anything like it. The place itself looks small from the outside, but it's got quite the dining area. My buddies and I each enjoyed our sandwiches, and the server in the front was extremely polite and patient with us since we had never gone. Would absolutely come again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by and tried to mac and cheese burger we really liked it! We want to come by again when we want more food to try more things. Great alternative if you're tired of all the typical burger joints. Service was nice and quick. Solid atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The best burgers in town! Forget the chains and go here if you are in the area. The burgers are moist, tender and tasty; the French fries are crunchy good. And if hot and spicy doesn't bother you, be sure to enjoy their outrageous sauce -- on your burgers and fries. After eating here, you'll never want your cheese on top of your burger but rather stuffed inside!"}
{"text":"Keep it simple - this is what I call a \"better burger\" how do you beat a burger stuffed with pastrami and Swiss?
The fries are delicious as well. Service is great and the lady at the counter took the time to explain this innovative delight."}
{"text":"The Reuben was one of the best I've ever had and their fry sauce changed my life. Loved it! Will be back weekly."}
{"text":"Being from Minnesota, I'm no stranger to a stuffed burger. Up there they call 'em Juicy Lucys but the idea is the same - cheese on the inside of the burger equals ooey gooey burger goodness.

My boyfriend and I went to Stufrageous on a Friday night. The place wasn't very busy, only a handful of customers.  We got two burgers and two orders of fries - the mac and cheese burger, the 3 cheese burger and both regular and sweet potato fries.

The burgers come out cut in half which does cut down on the cheese exploding out the back when you take the first bite so that was smart of them. We started with the 3 cheese. Honestly for 3 cheeses it wasn't very cheesy! It just kinda seemed like a normal amount of cheese and I was hoping for cheese overload. Plus, the burger was very well done, I like mine a little more medium. The mac and cheese burger was better. The mac and cheese and bacon gives the burger a fun texture and made it more flavorful (and actually seemed cheesier) than the 3 cheese. This burger was also more done than I prefer but it was the winner for sure.

Fries come out in big portions, we could have split one for sure. Both were good with their special sauce.

So would I say Stufrageous was good? Yes. Better than the Juicy Lucys back home? No way. The gimmick is good enough to get people in once but it will be interesting to see if the burgers keep them coming back."}
{"text":"My husband wanted to stop here for his Father's day lunch. This place lives up to its name! The stuffed burgers ate huge and you will NOT leave hungry. After reviewing the menu, I chose one of their signature burgers. I chose the Hawaiian burger. You get your choice of bun, I chose the regular bun, my burger was stuffed with provolone cheese, a pineapple slice, and Canadian bacon. The burger was topped with teriyaki sauce.  The lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle come on the side free of charge. The burger was cooked perfectly, medium well. My husband and I also ordered a side of fries. The fries came with a side of outrageous sauce. I felt the fries were too salty, but they were cooked perfectly and the sauce was good. I will be back to stuff my face with a stuferageous burger. FYI- you will need a ton of napkins eating this burger, they are yummy but super messy!"}
{"text":"My husband took me to this place and I was blown away. Everything is freshly made and you can make some pretty crazy concoctions. 
I get the veggie burger and it is amazing! Going to a burger place can be iffy when you are a vegetarian, but this place is great for that. 
Their fries are also freshly made and extremely delicious. They have a special fry sauce that seems to be a big hit. Great drink choices and they have China mist iced tea. It's the best!
The only downside is how long it takes to get your food. I think this comes from everything being freshly made so I can't complain about that. Highly recommend giving them a try!!"}
{"text":"Heard about this new burger joint that serves stuffed burgers are you kidding me.  Being from the Midwest we know about the  juicy Lucy. Needless to say the food is amazing and better value than the chains. Brought the family and all the kids ate.  Great spot will definitely come back.  Check out these photos."}
{"text":"I feel a little like Goldilocks - one member of my party loved their burger, one did not like it and mine was okay. 

Jen loved her Blue-cheese and bacon burger.  Patrick did not care for the Hawaiian burger, and my custom jalapeño popper burger was pretty decent. 

In all fairness, you get to customize everything about your burger.  So if you choose right, then it's good. Everything is fresh.  The fries are nicely done. Lots of choices!  

The burger meat itself is interesting - to me it was a soft texture - which I usually experience at home when I put fillers in.  I understand the meat has to form around all the stuffing. Not bad, but just good to know.  

I might try them again.  After all there are a lot of choices! Save room for dessert."}
{"text":"This place was decent. Kinda small but enough room for what they serve. The burgers are REALLY good, surprisingly so. The french fries are decent as well. Make sure to try their outrageous sauce. I ordered the stuffed jalapeno burger. I got pickled jalapenos and added green chiles. IT WAS SO GOOD! My roomie ordered their mac and cheese burger, which he has gone back 3 times for since lol.

Needless to say, we have come back."}
{"text":"So this place reminds me of 5 guys, but way better in my opinion. It's a little overpriced like 5 guys, so if you plan on getting a burger, fries and drink plan on 10-12 bones. 

With that being said, it's definitely worth it every once in a while. And if you know me, you know I'm frugal so it means quite a bit coming from me. 

The fries were bomb, their house sauce is amazing, and the burger was phenomenal. Oh, and that pickle spear tho!"}
{"text":"Boiled burgers? I had the beef Ruben on brioche  $7.49 and my wife had the Beef Greek on brioche. We shared a $1.50 drink and a $1.49 fries. With tax, $19.42 for two burgers, fries and a drink.  I went back and ordered the deep fried Mac & Cheese bites as an after though. Over all, the burgers and fries were disappointing. Take a look at the middle picture in the \"Are these photos helpful?\". Doesn't that burger look like it has been boiled. Both of ours looked and tasted like they had been boiled. I got up and walked around so I could see how they are cooked. I saw that they do really do use a grill. Both the burgers and fries had very little or no seasoning. Now I understand why they push their special sauce, it adds some spice and a shot of heat to the burgers and fries. My wife really liked the Mac & Cheese bites. The ice tea was very good. Bottom line, the signature burgers need something more than the ones we were served."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I've given this place a chance - I'm just not impressed!  The stuffed burgers are a novelty (I had the Reuben - burger stuffed with pastrami with fried onions) but it just didn't have much flavor.  My wife had the caprese burger and described it as fair & my son had the southwest burger and described it as mediocre.  Too many other good burger places in the valley which precludes me from giving this place a 3rd try."}
{"text":"OMG in town from San Diego and stopped at this little gem. Got the 3 cheese stuffed burger combo. And my daughter got the build your own stuffed with pepperoni and mozzarella cheese!! The burgers were amazing and presented well. The fries were crispy and fresh and the whole restaurant was very clean and tidy. Definitely would go here if they had one out my way but if I'm back in AZ I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"That's a yummy burger!  Never had a stuffed burger before, was driving past and thought I would give it a try.  Got the jalapeño melt and it had a great flavor.  Fries have a good crunch on the outside and are soft in the middle.  Overall a solid local joint."}
{"text":"This place was great. BBQ M.O.S. was great. Jalapenos popper was great. Outrageous sauce was great. Staff was great (really appreciated the customer service here; tall guy (Julius?) took time to explain everything to us and gave us great recommendations). Great experience. It was just...great."}
{"text":"It was ok, the fries came out 5 minutes before the burger did. The burger was good but nothing great, the lettuce and onion were on the side but the burger and bun were so small and it was cut in half that they were impossible to put on. $9.49 and I left hungry. Too many other places in town. I won't go back"}
{"text":"The food was good.  It wasn't great.  I would likely not go back.  I think this place is owned by the same company as The Habit which I actually liked better.  Don't get me wrong- you can definitely get a satisfying meal here, it's just nothing to rave about.  My fiance got the Reuben and liked it, but said it wasn't amazing or anything.  I got the one with mushrooms, swiss, crispy onions, and BBQ sauce.  Honestly, I don't think having the patty stuffed is better than having toppings on a burger.  The fries were good and I liked the seasoned salt on top of them."}
{"text":"I eat Ketogenically and went here hoping to find something for a quick dinner during a conference out of town.  This was great as they offer all their burgers/chicken lettuce-wrapped as well as a regular or whole-wheat bun!!  The friendly staff asked if this was my first time there.  When I said it was, she immediately brought me a French fry with the stufrageous sauce on it for me to try.  I didn't eat the fry, but tasted the sauce and it was delicious!  They couldn't tell me what it was sweetened with, so I skipped it for my meal.  I ordered the jalapeño popper stuffed burger and a side of ranch.  Their didn't appear to be any appropriate side for my needs, but the burger turned out to be plenty!  My order was completed quickly.  It came cut in half with each half of the burger in it's own lettuce cup like two lettuce tacos-very easy to eat with my hands (although utensils were available).  The jalapeños were fresh and crunchy and the cream cheese helped tame the heat on the tongue for a wonderful balance of heat and cream. And they completely held their own - no sauce needed!"}
{"text":"Pretty dang good. Milkshake was kind of just straight up milk but I think it was the persons first week or something so no worries. I'd love to give it 5 stars but the burger was just a bit over cooked. I'm a medium rare type of person and with the fact that all the toppings go on the inside the natural juices of the meat need to be there so the outside of the patty isn't dry......which it was. Like I said though....pretty dang good."}
{"text":"You need to find the combination you like...but once you get the right mix of the meat, the sauce and the toppings you're going to enjoy it
The chicken is juicy and soft.Their outrageous sauce is pretty decent with the right mix of spice and kick.
Overall worth getting your burger appetite fulfilled"}
{"text":"You take a burger and stuff it with all sorts of stuff, you get 5 stars from me. Why? Well for one, it's delicious duh! And two, I have never been able to successfully make one of these without the contents spilling all over my grill. My hubby and I pulled in here on a whim tonight and we're happy. He had the southwestern which was ooey gooey with cheese and green chilis. I had the jalapeño popper which had my fave combo of cool cream cheese and spicy fresh jalapeños. Yum! We had a side of the green chili Mac and cheese bites--nuff said. The kids working there were so nice and welcoming, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love burgers. Cheap burgers, greasy burgers, gourmet burgers, elk burgers, and all the burgers in between.

Stufrageous is just about as good as it gets for burgers, especially for the price. I've had $25+ burgers that I enjoyed less. This place is in the range of your slightly upscale casual California-style burger joint, like Smashburger or The Habit. Frankly, though, it's way way better.

Picture this: fresh jalapeños, crunchy bacon, and super decadent mac-and-cheese stuffed in a burger. Honestly, I don't know why someone hasn't come up with mac-and-cheese and burgers together before, because this was one of the best things I've ever eaten. The jalapeños were actually green and fresh, not that pickled stuff that's more vinegary than spicy. The bacon was generous and crispy, not limp. And the mac-and-cheese was out-of-this-world cheesy and rich. Stuffed in about 6oz of beef (it was pretty good beef, too), and you've got a cheesy masterpiece.

Also, I'm a picky fry connoisseur. The fries here are perfectly spiced, and not too salty. They came delivered to us crispy and firm on the outside, and piping hot on the inside. I love their house sauce too. I'm pretty sure it's some sort of conglomeration of mayo, Frank's Red Hot, and BBQ sauce, and it's really tasty. It was perfect on the fries, and on the burger.

Portion sizes are really generous. I went with my fiancee, and we both ordered a regular-sized burger, lettuce-wrapped, and a small thing of fries to share. It was extremely filling, and came to under $20 for the two of us. Beware though. If you're not a heavy eater, it's a total gut bomb. I couldn't have eaten here for lunch without really aching for a nap afterwards.

The decor is really clean and classy, and I liked the ambiance. I know it's weird to notice the ambiance of a burger joint, but I liked the uncovered industrial bulb fixtures and open-kitchen style of the restaurant. The cashier was super helpful, explained how the menu worked and what was popular, and gave us samples of fries and sauce. I've had worse service at way more expensive places, so I was deeply impressed.

I'm actually kind of mad that I know this place exists. I'm already craving another mac-and-cheese burger. Every time I chow down on a regular burger with cheese, I'm going to be aware of how much cheesier and more delicious it could be if it was mac-and-cheese."}
{"text":"Found this place and glad we did. The burgers, fries and shakes were awesome . And with Great customer service it was an overall great lunch. I had the Greek burger wrapped in lettuce and my husband and son both had the 3 cheese burger. If you've never been I highly recommend. We will definitely be coming back and it will be worth our drive from the west valley"}
{"text":"Burger and fries were ok.  Nothing that great.  I'd rather go next door to Boulders and get their Chuck Norris pizza and waffle fries."}
{"text":"Jalapeño melt is the way to go. Add bacon because why wouldn't you? Friendly and super helpful staff. I will be back."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious!!! Seriously I don't think you can go wrong, love this place."}
{"text":"I ordered the Jalapeno Melt burger and the Outrageous fries with pepperjack cheese, bacon bits, and outrageous sauce.   The burger meat was dry, and the lettuce was soggy.  The stuffing inside the burger was unique, but didn't offset the lack of flavor of the burger meat.  The buns were served plain with no toasting or other preparation evident.  It seems like they are banking on the novelty of having stuffing inside a burger and not putting much effort into the rest of the burger.

The Outrageous fries were just ok. They were cooked slightly more well done than I would have liked, yet still had a soggy texture to them.  There was not enough of the topping to justify the amount of fries that they served.  

I ordered for pick up, showed up 20 minutes later, and waited another 5-10 minutes for my order.  The restaurant did not seem to be busy at that time.  The staff members were nice and professional.

For the price and taste, I'd prefer In-N-Out to this restaurant, but I'll give it another try someday."}
{"text":"I tried Stufrageous tonight and thought it was really good. I got a Jalapeno Melt, and my husband got the three cheese. The staff was extremely friendly and talkative and we got a sample of the outrageous sauce before buying. 

The burger itself was tasty. Something about a bunch of cheese melted directly inside of a meat pile was magically delicious. I also LOVE the outrageous sauce. I think they put crack in it. Or sriracha, which may as well be crack to me. I wish I was one of those people who could taste something and guess the ingredients because I would churn a batch of this and eat it at home.

The only real negative I had -- I actually think I'd prefer a whole burger and not one cut in half. I felt like it was awkward to add the lettuce/tomato/onion onto two burger halves. They did very helpfully cut the accouterments in half to make this easier. I get it, though. It's the presentation -- you can see the oozing, gooey cheese and pile of jalapenos bursting from the burger when it's cut. Still, I wonder if I can choose to leave it whole, I'd definitely take that option.

I really liked the fries too -- they were nice and crispy and salty. 

I also wish we brought some cash because we didn't spend enough money to require a signature, and we couldn't leave a tip on our card. 

As for price -- I feel like this place is similarly priced to Five Guys which do I think is too expensive. However, I'd rather pay that money here, because it's a unique sort of burger, and not a chain fast food place. They weren't cheap at all on the ingredients -- my burger had a ton of jalapenos and cheese, and the one serving of fries was generous enough for two people to share. 

Much like the titular burger, I was completely stuffed upon leaving. I wish someone was around with a wheelbarrow to get me to my car.

I have a feeling I'll go back and try the chicken Greek burger and revise my rating to five stars. As of now I really enjoyed this place and do recommend it to anyone who wants to try something different."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food was fantastic but what stood out the most was the excellent customer service Jenna was so courteous and helpful . She explains how everything works and really went out of her way to make you feel special we'll most definitely be back because of her and the service my family received."}
{"text":"I like this place more than I thought I was going to. Initially it sounded like an over indulgent glutenous circus of food.
 Ok and maybe it is but it's so good. 

We shared the Ruben Burger that is stuffed with pastromi and cheese and special sauce. Damn that was good!

For the sides we ordered green beans, Mac n' cheese bites and stuffed fries that had cheese and bacon. 

My favorite were the green beans and my daughter loved the Mac n' cheese bites. They were very cheesy. Everything cooked to perfection. 

We don't get many unique and good places to eat in Mesa so go give it a try. ;)"}
{"text":"Companion and I arrived with 8 friends to sample this establishment.

Because of a group on the back porch which took a lot of the chairs outside, our seating was limited to 2 small tables and a high top. Not the worst thing in the world, but not totally comfortable either.

The first thing we noticed was the self serve fountain area. They had a selection that was a bit unique of flavors that everyone seem to like a lot. In particular, they had red cream soda which seemed to be a big hit with everyone.

Ordering is done at the counter. Most burgers are made of two patties sandwiched together with a filling inside of them. They were also fairly large and made a full meal.

I noticed that all the stuffed burgers were cut in half when served. I assume this is so that they can make sure they cheese or whatever stuffing is selected is properly cooked. Not a bad idea, but a bit different than I have seen before. 

The assortment of fillings is large, ranging from sauteed onions to jalapeno's to assorted cheeses and more.

My burger, stuffed with onions and cheese was excellent. While I prefer my burgers rare of medium rare, because of the fillings, cooking it this way is not possible; however, the burger was tasty and was not lacking in the juicy department.

Companion had the only burger in the group that wasn't loved. The jalapeno's in the burger were raw and included the seeds and membranes making for a very hot and spicy burger. Companion was not able to eat the burger, and to the credit of the owner, it was immediately taken off the bill and companion was offered something different at no cost.

There is no lack of customer service here. The owner checked on each table multiple times to make sure everyone was happy, not only in our group, but in the entire restaurant. Everyone in our party agreed that the burgers were great and the service was excellent.

The restaurant was spotless as were the rest rooms even though the place was quite crowded.

4 stars for outstanding service, good food, and good cleanliness."}
{"text":"We love this place. We live in west phoenix but still go into Mesa once a month or so and always make sure we take advantage of the chance to eat here. The build your own options are great and the staff is ALWAYS friendly.  
Our one and only complaint is that they only have one location. 

Eat there and be happy."}
{"text":"So I gave it 4 stars for the following reasons.
1) The taste - it was a good burger, I got the Reuben.
2) The dude at the counter - he was a nice and asked me if I was a first time customer. He ran me through the menu and let me sample the special sauce they use before they put it in my burger
3) Despite customer service and taste I felt like it was a pretty little burger for about 9 bucks... I didn't get a meal or anything simply a burger.

Moral of the story if you're not as gluttonous as me you'll probably be cool with the portion size and rate it higher.
I personally feel like it should be closer to the 5 guys price range since it's more of a specialty but smaller."}
{"text":"Great price, great burgers and fries. Sweet potato fries are tough to get right but these people made some delicious ones!"}
{"text":"Awesome place.  We split a ground chicken and beef burger.  I think the ground chicken won.   The secret sauce is the bomb.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Holy moly! We accidentally stumbled upon this place and boy are we glad we did! Great customer service, amazzzzzing fries and stuffed burgers. They only have one vegetarian option so if you're picky I'd steer clear. As for us, we had the beef burgers and were very satisfied! Their milkshakes are dirt cheap, too!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the fries are to die for. It's an excellent idea and I'd give it \"4\" stars if the burger patties were bigger. I love the stuffing. I've done it myself. 
     My wife tried the Southwestern and I had the Jalapeno Popper. They come cut in half, so it's easy to share and try more then one if you're with someone.
     The taste was very good. I loved the cream cheese and jalapenos. 
     We will be back because there are some many other interesting items on the menu. And they have milk shakes which will make my wife happy on our next trip. I'm not happy, because they don't have Strawberry.
     To be honest, you can spend the same amount at any close brewery or pub and get twice the meat.
      I think Sheldon from \"The Big Bang Theory\", would tell you that the \"Bun to Condiment to Meat Ratio\" is not optimal. As I ate, I could taste lots of bun, condiments and not nearly enough meat.
      Maybe next time I'll just pay for an extra patty. This place is very accommodating, so I think I'll find the perfect meat ratio if I give it a few more tries."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came here last night when we passed by and we were pleasantly surprised on the service and food. I definitely recommend this burger joint. The meals are very filling, we couldn't even finish our fries! I would say to get the Hawaiian chicken burger or the Jalapeño Melt burger. They were deeeelish! We will be returning soon"}
{"text":"First time at Stuffrageous and it was the bomb.com the staff, and service were great we had a big order and it was out quick the fried green beans and the outrageous sauce are killer definitely coming back"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and it can be a bit hit or miss. The cashier is usually pretty nice, but at least twice now they have messed up my order.  You can make your own burger  with a variety of toppings or order one of their signature burgers.  The regular fries are great, but their sweet potato fries tend to be soggy."}
{"text":"Went with a group of people and shared 5 different burgers and each one was delicious! Highly recommend for an amazing piece of meat."}
{"text":"it was pretty good i did a make my own with green chilies and cream cheese with outrageous sauce spicy good the green beans were great i really like the sauce kinda spicy and sweet im sure i will stop in again"}
{"text":"Went the other day food was good service was good I wish there was one closer to my house but that's ok it's worth the drive"}
{"text":"Food was great, restaurant was clean. The food fresher than most places.  I would rate this a 4 easy, maybe a 5, if it weren't for the 45minute wait. I almost left, which would have been a shame because mac and cheese in a burger just seems meant to be."}
{"text":"Decided to come here on a whim cause we were close and it had good Yelp reviews... so glad we did! I got the caprese burger and fries.... and they were both delicious! The burger was moist and flavorful! I don't live anywhere close to this, but I will go out of my way to come again in the future!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place! The food was great, the owner/manager was super helpful, and the drink station was clean! 

My boyfriend and I walked in and were immediately greater with a, hello! From Justin. He asked if it was our first time in and we said it was. He gave us a few fries to sample with their outrageous sauce (more on that lovely concoction later), and told us about the menu and answered all of our questions. 

We decided on two signature burgers with double patties, when in Rome, right? For him the BC&B, for me the Mac and cheese burger. I really appreciate that they offer all the veg on the side, and I advise to snag the pickle, so good! And super added bonus, if you ask for it they will make your bacon extra crispy! 
We also added an order of outrageous fries with bacon and blue cheese. 

About 5 min after we ordered our fries came out first, and they were amazing! I could make a meal of just those alone. Their signature outrageous sauce is so yummy, it's a little sweet, a little heat, a little savory all melded in creamy goodness. If they bottled it I would absolutely buy it. 

Next were the burgers. Holy cow. Huge!!!!! We looked at what each other ordered and decided to split and share our burgers just to taste it all. The meat was perfectly seasoned with salt and pepper, super fresh tasting and so incredibly juicy. Normally I wouldn't have been able to finish a whole burger that size being it was a double patty, but I ate it all, and it was so worth it! 

All in all we had a great meal and will be back often, I'm sure. This just replaced my enthusiasm for the in and out I found out is near by when we moved in."}
{"text":"Everything looked amazing and there are SO MANY OPTIONS on how you can have your burger and fries. Just happened to stumble across this on Foursquare and glad we did!"}
{"text":"When I heard a stuffed burger restaurant opened up I knew I had to try it! In addition to the various preset options they also have a create your own burger option. Base proteins include beef and chicken. 

The interior of the restaurant is nicely designed with a contemporary casual feel. Ordering is done at the counter and your meal is served to you at your table.

I ordered the Southwest burger and tried some of the caprese. The Southwest burger had good flavor and just a little spicy kick from the chiles. I wasn't as impressed with the caprese. I would have liked more basil in the burger since I could barely taste it.

The question I had when I was eating this burger was, do I really need this stuffed? What is the benefit to having a stuffed burger other than for the sheer novelty? Generally, I think the stuffed idea works to keep the filling ingredients juicy and keeps everything from squeezing out the sides. 

This is definitely a place I'd like to try again for more tasty burgers."}
{"text":"I had the mac n cheese stuffed burger. It was bomb! Great place, local, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is s fun place. You get a burger stuffed with your favorite toppings. Got the burger with mushrooms, onions, and cheese. Tasted great. My wife got the jalapeño popper that had cream cheese and peppers. Very tasty! Prices are good and the French fries are some of the best I've had. Great sauce for dipping them as well. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing burger!! This place would make a killing in oregon. Very tasty burger and fry combo. The fries are just right and the chef is awesome and friendly."}
{"text":"What a treat it was going here. We hadn't heard of it but we were in the neighborhood and it came up on our search. Amazingly good food. The fries were fantastic! Service was quick and friendly. Good prices, clean."}
{"text":"If you want AMAZING burgers, this joint is worth every minute of your drive. The first thing I realized upon entering is how freaking clean and spotless this place is. The burgers are absolutely delicious, juicy and served RIGHT off the stove. There are a ton of different burgers to choose from OR you can choose what you want in it. The prices are so ridiculously reasonable, you wouldn't believe. So I built my own burger, and then after, I also ordered a cookie..... Just outright amazing. And even that is such an understatement. The owners make you feel like family, and are so genuine. Everyone needs to try this place. I will DEFF be returning."}
{"text":"We've been here two or three times and have had a positive experience each time.  The food is very good and the restaurant itself is well maintained and comfortable.  There are a variety of table sizes so any party size can be accommodated.  The team working here is friendly, patient, and knowledgeable about their products.  With the vast number of options, one is bound to have questions, particularly if it's their first visit.  No need to worry - they don't make you feel bad about that at all and don't rush you to figure it out."}
{"text":"Excellent Burgers!! I had the Southwestern and highly recommend it. I would definitely be coming back if I lived in the area. Need one in Indiana."}
{"text":"It's a pretty good burger, I feel like it was just a little overpriced but not too much so it's not bad, the pastrami I had had a strange texture but a good flavor! The burger overall was better than average, the combo was enough to fill me up, it's a good place, and has a neat feel, it didn't blow my mind but it was pretty dang good!"}
{"text":"We found this place via Yelp during a recent trip out to Mesa CC for a festival. What a great find! While I will say that it wasn't a perfect experience, I had a blast here and got a great meal.
They stuff your burger with whatever you want! It's a messy, tasty, calorie-filled food excursion - I would be happy to go back soon. I had mine stuffed with cheese and bacon and macaroni and spinach and topped with all the fixins. I also got some sweet potato fries and a milkshake - the full splurge experience. And I regret nothing.
We came during a non-busy time in between a couple of my work commitments. There were maybe two other parties in the place. We went up to the counter, ordered, and got our food quickly. The fries (basket) were a great portion - worth it to pay a little extra. I wish my burger was a bit bigger - but it was really delicious. The milkshake was yummy - but I wanted it to be thicker.
All in all, I'll definitely stop in again when I'm back in Mesa... not sure when that will be..."}
{"text":"First time here, came in on a whim, picked up grandson from school, we were hungry. Really nice place seems fresh and inviting from the simple but clean decor, staff is very friendly. I had the southwestern, i could only eat half, wow, i was full, my grandson had 3 cheese, he was full. Definitely will come back, recommend for those burger connoisseurs, delicious."}
{"text":"What a great concept. A delicious burger, great fries, tasty special sauce, friendly staff, clean restaurant, and great value. I tried the Mac and cheese burger, and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Dog friendly patio!

Found this place on Groupon. I totally love the idea behind this place, stuffing a burger patty full of green chili mac and cheese just feels right to me!

What your get for what you pay is pretty close in value - especially with the Groupon.

Everything is order separate so you can customize your meal as you like with ease.

The problem I had with this place is that other than the stuffed patty the food is forgettable. Once you get past the stuffing idea it's just kind of \"meh\" on the taste. Not something I would crave but also not something I would turn down if offered it."}
{"text":"I wish these burgers were bigger.  6 oz of meat is not enough. That said that was some delicious 6 oz of meat.  The patties are stuffed with deliciousness such as a reuben, which I had and was the burger of the month, or a BBQ MOS, which the boyfriend had.  You choose your own bun (brioche, whole wheat, or protein-style - I didn't care for my overly fluffy brioche bun), and choose your stuffing.

The reuben was exactly what you'd expect, erupting in deliciousness, but a little dry cause I had asked for my ourageous sauce on the side - you have been warned, don't make this mistake.  I traded half of my reuben for half of my boyfriend's BBQ MOS (I wonder how much he appreciates of me stealing his food...) and oh the gloriousness of the barbecue burger!  Juicy, amazing, and of course, the barbecue sauce!  I wolfed it down and stared at my hands, which were now, newly burger-free.  Oh the disappointment. 

We shared a small side of outrageous fries, which is fries with a choice of one cheese and a stuffing.  And of course, outrageous sauce, which reminds me of the in-n-out sauce but with a little more tanginess to it.

So in a nutshell, deliciousness, EVERYWHERE.  But my little grievances would have to be: small burgers and pretty long wait times since they start your burger after you place the order and I think there was only one guy making burgers that night; I ended up waiting 25 minutes for my order, which is fine but it would've been good to know beforehand.  Anywho, definitely worth a shot and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"So yes, I am one of THOSE people that searches Groupon for new restaurants to try.  And I found one for Stufrageous.  We walked in, and I was immediately  impressed with the cleanliness, the atmosphere and the smile from the cook.  When the girl at the counter realized it was our first time here, she gave us a couple of fries with their special sauce to taste.  Delish!  My husband got the mac & cheese burger (stuffed with m&c, bacon and jalapeño), fries and a shake.  I built my own burger:  stuffed with spinach, bacon, swiss, mushrooms and onions.  We both upgraded to the 8oz patties, too.   We got tempura green beans and mac & cheese bites (my fave!) as an appetizer.  The food came out quickly, it was hot and fresh.

WOW!  Just.  WOW. 

 Great burgers, great service.  The manager stopped by and checked on our food quality.  We ended up taking half our food home, which will make an awesome lunch tomorrow!  

We will definitely be back, whether we have a groupon or not!   Ten stars!  Seven thumbs up!  Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Good burger for fast food. Very interesting concept and nice staff. Fires could of been cooked a little longer"}
{"text":"This place is a slightly hidden gem in Mesa Northeast of the Fiesta Mall. 

So when I got there, there were only two other people eating. No problem, faster lines. The cashier who greeted us was very kind and offered to let us try some of their house sauce, which was very delicious. Reminded me faintly of the In N Out spread. 

Anyways, I ordered the Greek stuffed burger, which had feta cheese, spinach and tomatoes inside and some fries. I watched them carefully stuff the beef patties with the ingredients and grilling them and put the bread in this ferris wheel toaster thing. It was good to see that live.

The burger tasted really good. This was my first time eating a stuffed burger... and it was a delightful experience in my mouth. Fries were good too, not too salty. If I come back here, I will definitely try their other things. They all sound so good."}
{"text":"Brand new place, very clean service was awesome and the food was good! Pretty big space as well, have to a and light music for entertainment. I'd recommend this to anyone in the area or passing through. Great concept for a burger place!"}
{"text":"Super amazing food! Definitely a lot of value for your money and the food quality is very high. All of the staff were very friendly too! I would highly recommend this restaurant if you're in the mood for a delicious burger!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers!  I had 3 different types of cheese stuffed in my burger and it was amazing.  Real beef flavor for the burger.  My wife and I shared an order of fries covered with bacon and cheese.  We went with the smaller size and it was plenty to share.  We finished lunch with a Loaded Cookie.  Definitely a good spot and worth the try."}
{"text":"Whoever came up with this idea is a genius! So good. I got a Stuff Your Own Burger and it was really delicious. My table also got fries, sweet potato fries, and green bean fries and all of it was great! All I can say is noms."}
{"text":"I'm seriously contemplating driving from Southern California just to get the Jalapeño Popper Burger again!"}
{"text":"This is a great place with friendly staff, cleanliness, and so many good food choices! Their shakes are amazing and the fries are bomb AF. I definitely recommend you come here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I had the Ruben stuffed burger and it was great. I loved the sweet potato fries as well with the outrageous fries and it was fantastic. The only problem was I finished it in like 1 minute. Personal problem I guess. Great place!"}
{"text":"By far the best burger I've ever had! I got the mac n cheese burger (recommended by the very friendly and attentive cashier). It comes with mac n cheese, bacon and fresh sliced jalapeños. Everything about it was perfect! You get your choice of ground beef or ground chicken for your burger, I chose chicken. It was great! The chicken was juicy and tender and seasoned perfectly! And the outrageous sauce is a MUST!!! The fries came out first and they were hot and crispy just like I like them. The restaurant was clean and inviting and the staff was very friendly. I was greeted immediately and Everyone was smiling, I loved that. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow just amazing food I never believed someone can make a burger stuffed taste so good perfect amount stuffed what I love about it that it's family owned and you can tell they put tlc in that burger and magic fries"}
{"text":"oh my goodness. I pity those on diets and the health nuts for not experiencing this place. Mac and cheese stuffed burger? Pepperoni pizza stuffed burger? You kidding me bruh?! So freaking good. The staff was extremely friendly an patient with me also as I tried to decipher the menu and decide what I wanted. I only wish I lived closer. Way to go guys, this place is fantastic."}
{"text":"Really delicious build your own stuffed burgers! Choose your cheese and other \"toppings \" choose your bun and and also can choose between ground beef or chicken. The fries are great too."}
{"text":"Definitely worth a try!  There are lots of stuffed burger options, but if you're feeling creative, you can certainly create your own.  The workers were helpful and answered any questions for us first-timers.  Everything is reasonably priced, and the portions are generous.  While we enjoyed our food, I would say this place is more of a novelty.  I will definitely come back, but I'd have to be in the right mood for this."}
{"text":"Came to try this new place out and could not have been more satisfied. I'm completely stuffed after Stufrageous - no pun intended- no really I couldn't decide on which burger to get so I ended up with the Greek Burger with chicken (melted in my mouth-literally) and the Mac and Cheese burger with beef (sooo yummy). For my side I got the tempura green beans---my favorite things and these too melted in my mouth. (If you don't believe me then try for yourself and get back to me) Dip everything in the outrageous sauce!! Ended the night with their chocolate chip baked cookie topped with ice cream, Oreos, whipped cream and fruity pebbles --- say what??--- yes I said fruity pebbles!!! I heart fruity pebbles!!! 

I will definitely be back again!!! --Caprese burger I got my eye on you--"}
{"text":"A stuffed hamburger isn't a new thing. Heck I've seen infomercials for products to help you make them. But a restaurant specializing in them, well that's new. 
I've been here 3 times now and will continue to come in the future: plenty of selection -  from meat, bun, cheese, and stuffing - on the burgers is well done and taste great. Tempura green beans were not my first choice in sides but are now my go to - tight, crisp taste. They even go well with the Stufrageous Sauce, a spicy and creamy dressing.
Overall, worth the trek and I hope they are successful enough to open more of them."}
{"text":"Outstanding.

Burgers joints have been popping up on every corner throughout the valley for years. Some are great most suck. Stuffrageous is great. I love a good Juicy Lucy and this place has their shit together.
Great food, unique concept, affordable and excellent service.
Highly recommended and will return again and again....."}
{"text":"Service was good. The guy behind the counter was very friendly even gave us a sample and told us their sauce was a little spicy. The burgers were good sized and moist  and I liked the stufrageous fries. The sauce was a tad spicy almost with a buffalo flavor and that was really good. My one complaint is my mac and cheese burger was not as cheesy as I would have hoped it was more macaroni and the jalapeños in the burger had a lot of bite which I feel would have been better mixed with more cheese. And I went for a creme soda in the fountain and the soda was flat and not working. But besides that keep doing what you are doing. The business works well in my book."}
{"text":"The burgers are so good! I love the option for chicken or beef. You can even make your own stuffings. The bbq, the jalapeño popper and the Greek are so good! The tempura green berms are also very good! Also the loaded cookie is soooo good! The service was so good! The owner Jenna was very help with picking And patient with our indecisive order. Thanks Jenna! We will be recommending this place to everyone we know."}
{"text":"Great burgers! I got the Mac and cheese one and it was so good! The outrageous sauce is to die for! Hopefully they start bottling it for sale soon. The fries were real fries with seasoning and they came out fast. Great we will return!"}
{"text":"First time here customer services was and have to say...\"VERRRYYYYY AMAZING\" I ordered the Jalapeño Melt have to say...\"WOOOW AMAZING\" good burger love it...I will come back to this place for sure. It's close to where I live and if your in a rush you could order on line and it will be ready by the time you get here. the secret sauce is the bomb!."}
{"text":"This may have been the best burger I have ever had, and I make a point to try to go to all the local joints that I can. I was just blown away by the Jalapeno Popper burger. Sweet Potato fries were good and the price wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"Opened today. Excellent burger. My husband had his burger stuffed with mac and cheese. I had mine stuffed with green chili's and cheese. They also have chicken burgers and veggie burgers. Sweet potato and regular fries as well as green bean fries. Very good!  Staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"I really like the idea of this restaurant. I love hamburgers and I love that they have a bunless option with no question. I ordered the stuffed jalapeno popper Burger with an added egg on top. I also ordered bacon cheese fries. On their own they were each pretty good. The single serving of the cheese fries was way too much for any one person. I think I ate maybe half. Portion size is obviously not an issue. Unfortunately in my online order I did specify I wanted condiments on my burger and there was supposed to be house sauce on my fries. I didn't get any of those and of course didn't notice until I got home. I had also forgotten that I had purchased a bottle of water until I got home and realized it was not in my bag. So I am still leaving a 4-star rating because the flavor of the burger as well as the flavor of the french fries themselves were really really good. This did not lacking flavor at all. I'm just disappointed in the lack of checking to make sure that my order was correct before handing it to me. I would definitely try again but would double check my order before walking out."}
{"text":"Nice clean establishment with decent food. The sweet potato fries were especially good. Reasons for low score... The staff was not very inviting and lacked basic food knowledge. Example: my wife has allergies and asked if she could tell us what's in the sauce. Answer given was, \"I'm not sure. I don't know. She won't tell us. There's 6 ingredients. It's mayo based.\" You could kill someone! Learn your menu people. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"The new place to go to ! I had the Jalapeño Melt stuffed burger, and the Hawaiian burger as well. They were both delicious and will definitely be coming back again soon ! They did offer the burgers in either beef or chicken patty, I got them both in beef but will be heading back to sample out the chicken patties next."}
{"text":"Literally love at first bite. OMG. I loved that the burgers sticked together and wasn't flimsy. 

I ordered the mac n cheese burger and my boyfriend had the jalapeño melt. Both burgers were delicious. However, I liked his jalapeño melt better because I'm a sucker for cream cheese. I liked the mac n cheese burger because there is mac n cheese inside the beef patty but the jalapeño melt felt like it was more meatier/beefier. I was really surprised how freakin' good this place was. 

The young ladies behind the counter were so nice and they welcomed us with fries and a sample of the outrageous sauce. The way I would compare the taste is similar to miso-mayo sauce from sushi restaurants. 

Grab a milkshake before you go. It's only $2.99. I got vanilla, with Reese's cups and Oreos. So creamy!

I have to come back and try their outrageous fries!"}
{"text":"Great burgers. I got the macaroni & cheese with jalapeños & bacon. This is a really neat concept. They stuff the burgers with a tipping of your choice and then cook them. Very clean restaurant. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Our new find! These burgers were yummy!! Most of the ingredients are cooked in between 2 patties. I can't wait to try another!"}
{"text":"I can't believe we haven't ate at this place sooner. The main problem with it is that is has lousy curbside viewing.  It on Southern near Alma School near Boulders on Southern.  The burgers are great, juicy and loaded with whatever fixings you can think of, they also have great tasting shakes made with Thrifty Ice Cream. They also have a couple of local beers available, Papago and Huss. The only thing average was the fries. Everything else was delish."}
{"text":"What a great concept....stuffed burgers as a fast food kind of deal....been here twice now and tried two different version...both were excellent....clean and fast and friendly...my only suggestion is ask to not have the burger cut in half....I dont like mine cut in half"}
{"text":"Absolutely tasty! The outrageous sauce is a must! Simply trendy location and super chill. Great food for great price!"}
{"text":"I can see this place doing well if they branch out. Of course if they came to Cali, they'd have to have grass fed beef options, but aside from that we all liked this novel spin on a classic burger.

Lots of stuffed burger options and toppings - and you can create your own.

The hubs got a stuffed chicken sandwich that was surprisingly tasty. Seasoned well and very tender. My kids and I tried the Mac 'n cheese w/bacon burger...mmm, healthy LOL! It was tasty though.

The only critique I'd have is to improve the beef quality, and make sure they are piping hot when served. They lost a full star for that."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in we were greeted and the lady behind the counter was super friendly.. We ordered the blue cheese,bacon and jalepeno burger with side of mac and cheese bites and \"pizza\" stuffed chicken sandwich with side of onion rings.. I loved my burger and the Mac and cheese bites were pretty good.. My boyfriend said that he liked his chicken stuffed pizza but stated that the bites that didn't have the stuffed pizza with it, the chicken really didn't have any flavor.. Other then that he said he enjoyed his food.. One thing I do have to say negative about this place is that when they didn't have any customers coming in all the employees disappeared to the back even though they had customers still eating .. And when my boyfriend went to go get a to go box he was waiting by the counter for couple of minutes until one of the employees realiZed there was someone waiting.. But other than that this place was pretty good.. If u check in here you can get a free regular drink"}
{"text":"Stufrageous Burgers are awesome!  I ate here for the first time tonight, had the beef jalapeño melt burger and tempura green beans (per the owners suggestion) and they did not disappoint!  Delicious cheese melted inside the burger with a nice kick from jalapeños, I'm not sure how they do it but I am sold.  Can't wait to come back and try a stuffed chicken burger and Mac 'N Cheese bites or the sweet potato fries looked amazing.  They also have half baked pizza cookies with ice cream, will have to try that in white chocolate macadamia nut as well.  Great new place, service was too notch and price is right.  Definitely recommend giving Stufrageous a try!"}
{"text":"Yet another excellent meal here. Its so nice that you can customize anything on the menu and the staff actually encourages you to do so and are more than happy to help giving you hints and tips of what they like best. And speaking of the staff they are absolutely outstanding and friendly more than willing to go above and beyond.  
The manager I believe her name is Jenna but I may be wrong is one of the best in the business so friendly and so helpful, I can't wait for our next meal here!
It's so refreshing to see a restaurant that actually cares about Customer Service."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm out of town and time permits, I have to try a local burger joint. This is where I ended up during my 4 day trip to Chandler, AZ (work training). I walked in around 6pm on a Monday night and the place was pretty empty. The gal working the register asked me and my buddy if it was our first time to which we replied \"Yes\". She then grabbed a couple of fries and drizzled their special sauce on them and gave them to us to sample. Two thumbs up for the sauce!

I ordered the (beef) BBQ M.O.S. with grilled onions on a brioche bun and some fries. The burger is served pre-sliced in two halves. This helps with the presentation of their \"stuffed burgers\". I can dig it. After taking my first bite I was convinced that this place has a good concept going with these stuffed burgers. My buddy ordered the (beef) caprese and he was thoroughly satisfied as well.

I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone craving a reasonably priced, fresh & juicy burger. I will definitely come back and try something else on their menu when I'm in town again. 

My only gripe: the fries are whatever. They aren't horrible -- I just wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"The Good: the lettuce wrap burgers are excellent!
Friendly staff 
Clean

The Okay: Fries are good

The Weird:  Food comes out as its ready, no particular order , fries came first, burgers 7 minutes later , green beans 5 minutes after that then salad another 5 minutes later . 

The Bad: Slooooow!  Waited in line almost 10 minutes then from order to delivery of last item 31 minutes!
Green beans were burnt to a crisp tasted like charcoal.
Got order wrong but didn't have time to have them fix it"}
{"text":"This place is out of this world! I have been there 3 times and have never been dissatisfied. Also, I never leave hungry. The variety and options leaves you wondering what you're going to devour next. I stuff burgers at home with go at cheese and some basil but it can never compare to their burgers! Will be coming back more often."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The Mac N Cheese bites were out of this world yummy!!
My husband and I ordered the Jalepeno melt & the Greek burger, both were amazing!  I will definitely be coming back for more! Excellent service and atmosphere along with yummy food."}
{"text":"Guys, the food and staff are fantastic, but you need to handle this AC issue!  It's always warm in the restaurant, but today (7/26) is ridiculous!  I'm going to assume the AC is broken since there are a few fans around the store.  No joke its 90 degrees in here!"}
{"text":"I'm really glad I decided to check this place out!! To start with the restaurant is spotless, the decor is fun and inviting! The menu is very easy to navigate. I'll admit I was a little intimidated by all the choices being this is my first stuffed burger! The young lady with black framed glasses and her hair in a bun so so accommodating. She walked us trough the menu and explained the process and even made recommendations. The 5 star service came when I asked what the \"outrageous\" sauce was like and she excitedly offered me a sample with a few fries! It was delicious!! Spicy and sweat! 

Lots of menu items makes this place great for for everyone! The brioche bun was super soft and buttery and my burger was great! It was large so I could only finish half! The same lady checked up on ask a few times which was nice. Overall this is a 5 Star place! Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I love Stuffrageous. First time there I ordered a BC&B with beef. The bleu cheese and bacon was the perfect mix. I've also had the jalapeño popper on a beef patty which was tasty but a bit spicy for my spice sensitive self. Most recent try was a caprese with sundried tomatoes instead of the fresh ones on a chicken patty and that was delicious. I also was order their Mac n cheese bites and love the marinara and the Outrageous sauce they serve them with. The  service is always friendly and prompt and they aren't badly priced."}
{"text":"Burgers where OK and I really like the fries. There was just nothing special about the burger other than being able to choose the stuffing."}
{"text":"I was impressed by the options available on the menu, and the ability to \"build your own\" stuffed burger. I think it's a great place to go! Facilities are clean and look nice. Staff are very nice. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the presentation of cutting the burger in half and presenting the \"stuffed\" burger sideways makes it really messy to eat; and side note: the fries got soggy really quickly, so I think next time I have to ask for burger whole not sliced in half, and extra crispy fries."}
{"text":"Decided to come here on a whim, and wow it was great! The burgers are stuffed and you can even customize your own burger. The prices are also amazing- got a huge chocolate milkshake with Oreos for $2.45. I only wish they had a location in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, the food is incredible and the portions are huge!! I ordered my food online and they are very accurate with the wait time. I definitely would not order the double burger unless you are 1. EXTREMELY HUNGRY or 2. You are looking for an eating challenge haha. Stufrageous has definitely gained a new customer for life!"}
{"text":"Esrablishment was super clean and staff was eagar and friendly.  I ordered the chicken buger (ground chicken) 3 cheese, with basil and outrageous so use with shoestring fried onions.  TOTAL KICK ASS!! The cheese was dripping off the sandwhich... OMG!!  The tempura green beans topped off my meal.  To die for!!  First time here, won't be my last!"}
{"text":"Tried Stufrageous last night, 8/11. I ordered burgers and fries to-go for myself and my boyfriend. The woman taking the order on the phone was polite. I figured we could try it out because the star rating was high. When I went to pick up and pay for the order, instead of thanking me (even after I said thank you), the cashier said \"you're all set\". After spending many years in sales and retail/management, regardless of what someone purchased from me be it $5 or $50K, I said \"thank you\". 

I had the stuffed Reuben burger. The flavors were good but I could tell it was a frozen pre-made beef patty and everything was extremely greasy. One of the toppings I ordered was missed. The pastrami was better than the burger. My boyfriend had the plain unstuffed cheeseburger, they neglected to add the sauces I had asked for when I placed the order. The order of fries we shared were greasy and floppy, should have been in the fryer a little longer. We both, unfortunately, ended up sick after the meal.

Conceptually, it's a really fun idea for a quick and inexpensive dinner...but poorly executed, sad to say. We wanted to love it, but just couldn't."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying! The name says it all! I am a picky eater when eating out. When I do eat out I usually go to in n out burgers for something quick! My family and I were shopping Monday and noticed this place was new. It actually had just opened the week before. As soon as we walked into the restaurant we were greeted by 2 different employees. The menu offerings were amazing! They even offered chicken patty options if your not into red meat! I couldn't decide what to get so I ordered the Greek burger, my husband got the green chili  burger and the kids ordered the Mac n cheese burger. These gourmet burgers were delicious! Everything from the buns to the meat and stuffing to the outrageous sauce! It was truly outrageous! We don't live near the restaurant so we are hoping for more locations to come, but in the meantime we will always be stopping by when in the area! Great food, nice atmosphere, clean and great service!!!!"}
{"text":"Really good burger and fries.  Hubby and I shared the jalapeño poppers burger, fries and a drink for around $10. We actually took some home (he will eat the leftovers for lunch this week. :))."}
{"text":"Great idea for something different and delicious!  They even have healthier options like chicken and veggies burgers!  You MUST try the mac and cheese burger..save up the calories, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Stufrageous has this amazing sauce that I wish I could recreate. The burgers, are stuffed with the perfect amount of your choosing and if burgers aren't your thing, they also have fully loaded hotdogs. The desserts look insane. I haven't personally tried one but, their sauce, Is outstanding."}
{"text":"This was truly a unique find. The concept is take a hamburger patty or chicken and stuff it with some awesome ingredients and out it on a bun or lettuce wrap. I had the southwestern stuffed burger which had green chilies and pepper jack cheese oozing out of it. It was very good and we also had the tempura green beans. All this was drizzled in their secret sauce which was amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing take on burgers. Do yourself a favor and give this place a try and pass on all the cookie cutter burger joints."}
{"text":"My boy friend and I stopped by here because it's close to our houses and looked good. Staff was friendly. It took FOREVER for our food to be ready. They brought out our fries fist. We finished them befor our burgers got to use. Then they made my bfs  burger  wrong. Took another 10min for it to come out on top of the 25min we waited for our  food original. I finished me meal befor he got his. For as long as we waited we could have gone some were nice.  Was  a nice experiment  but we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Had a Three Cheese Burger on a brioche bun, so yummy!! Tried the Mac n cheese bites, Taisted like tempura batter. They do have tempure green beans so maybe...

Will be back to try the Jalapeno Popper burger!"}
{"text":"This place was great. Don't live on this side of town. So we just kinda stumbled across it. Got the mac cheese burger. Add green chilies it was fantastic. The fries are delecious with the special sauce!!! and the customer service was a huge plus in every way. Side note my wife wasn't a stuffed burger person. Now she is.. haha"}
{"text":"Best burger ever! And fries are to die for! Been there twice and will be going back lot more! Fast service and the staff is vary friendly! Make your own is the best. Great selection of stuffens!"}
{"text":"Some of my co-workers told me about this place and I thought I would check it out. ,There are a ton of options on the menu so I was a bit overwhelmed on what to get but ended up with a bacon and onion stuffed burger. Overall it was very good and maybe next time I should study the menu a bit more so I can be a bit more adventurous."}
{"text":"Okay first off, when I got to Stufrageous there was only a family and me and 4 ppl working. I ordered three things, jalapeño melt burger, outrageous fries and an outrageous hot dog. I got my meal in a half an hour of waiting, Idk if 4 ppl is under staffed or not? But yeah a half an hour I finally got my food. I got myself some Orange Fanta and it was not an orange Fanta.... like it tasted flat and felt like like it was bad. I asked one of the guys from the family that was there to taste it too and he said the same thing. Back to the food, the burger was really good but the fries and hot dog  just wasn't on point at all, fries taste old and the bun from the hot dog tastes old as well plus the meat \"dog\" was burnt . I had high hopes before stepping into this place but was disappointed . I gave it three stars cause at least one thing was good and the place was trendy. Hope this review helps"}
{"text":"I've dined with all the greats.  Pavaratti, Giovanni, Lipschitz... and none of them had the sense they were born with.  That's why I now dine with J-WoW.  Less than 32.5 seconds after walking into this establishment, she recommends that we each order something different, so we can double our exposure.  Yes!  I just know Bocelli would have ordered the same mac-n-cheese burger that I would have ordered... the blind fool!

J orders the stuffed mac&cheese and fries, while I go with the stuffed reuben and tempura green beans.  Sometimes you realize you lose.  While the tempura veggie is a \"must-try\", the reuben burger is a \"must-miss\"!  I just know Andrea is somewhere, singing to me, right now \"Who's the fool now, you bald headed pelican?\"

I'll be back to try the other creations.

I shall also give props to J-WoW's m&c stuffed burger (get it... no, I didnt drop an inside joke... I'm telling you to order it!), and I thought the outrageous fries were good... until they cooled down... then they were just embarrassing themselves.  Next time, a tin of dignity might be in order... hmmm?  I dont even know what that means.  You should have stopped reading a paragraph ago"}
{"text":"Fatty burger has a new all time new!

I ordered the stuffed mac and cheese burger on brioche combo. Two thin beef patties molded around soft, gooy, cheesy, mac and cheese with jalapeños and bacon. To my surprise the burger did not fall apart at all. It was well packed and stuffed. It was very heavy,definitely filled me up. The fries were fresh and crispy. Since it was my first time, the girls behind the counter offered to sample their outrageous sauce. It was almost like a spice in-n-out sauce. I could understand why people would want to put it all over their burgers and fries, but I kept mine on the side this time to try to original taste. 

This could easily be a $10+ burger at a sit-down restaurant but they were able to make these fast and affordable. I love that Wednesdays you are able to get free fries! I'll have to come back again on my \"cheat day\". 

Environment: 5/5

{"text":"Pretty good for a burger joint.
I got a mushroom burger with grilled onions and Monterey Jack cheese.
On a brioche roll.
The roll was heavenly- not too big, not too thick, soft as butter and tasty.
Best hamburger bun ever!
Meat nice and thick- perfectly sized to bun.
Coked medium exactly- perfect for me.
Good flavor too- I don't eat beef dry often and am really picky.
The vanilla malt was good- but not as good as Johnny Rockets.
I didn't get fries. Too much food and it's not cheap!
$10.00 for burger and malt.
But worth it.
Just.
Would come Back here for sure!"}
{"text":"We lived across the street from this restaurant and didn't know. We had it delivered after finding them on GH and it was amazing. Sad to say we are moving. Hopefully they have multiple locations."}
{"text":"They provide a tasty burger, can't fault them on that. The employees were all happy to be there, and seemed interested in my dining experience. The price was on par with what you get. There are a 2 reasons I won't be back, the first is that the fries came out 8 mins before the burger and were stone cold by then and the second is that the whole stuffed burger thing seemed wasted. Take a bite or two and its all spilling out. I loved the house sauce though."}
{"text":"That sauce though...

The fried green beans are unbelievably good. I enjoyed them 1,000,000 times more than the fries. I am tempted to try some of the other side offerings, but... what's the point when I've already experienced the taste of perfection?

I've had both the beef and chicken versions of the jalapeno popper burger. Both were very good, but I've gotta say I was surprised by how much I liked the chicken. I expected it would be drier than the beef, but it was very, very juicy! I will probably stick with the chicken from now on. Might as well choose the healthier option if it tastes just as good, right?"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in on a whim and I am happy we did. The person that took our order took her time to explain everything to us and offered us a taste of their outrageous sauce on some warm, fresh fries.

We ordered two beef stuffed burgers - the Ruben and the BBQ. Both were delicious. We also got an order of outrageous fries with cheddar, bacon, and sauce...these were my favorite part of the meal, but we did need to use the outrageous sauce my husband requested on the side towards the end. The fries on the bottom didn't have cheese or sauce.

From a price perspective it is close to what we would pay for dinner at Firehouse or Jimmy Johns and this was a much hardier meal.

I am interested in trying a chicken stuffed burger next time and my husband wants to try the mac n cheese bites.

Only wish is for nutritional information. I understand this could be difficult given the nature of customization, but info on their chef created stuffed burgers in beef and chicken would be helpful."}
{"text":"We ordered

Veggie burger (3/5): Average, not bad, not great.

Sweet potato fries (2/5): I was craving them but didn't like these. Something was missing. Maybe a spice or herb because we added salt but it didn't help. It felt like the outside was crispy but the inside was soft.

Mac and cheese bowl (4/5): Was good.

Prices were good, portions were good, service was good, but flavor didn't satisfy. Would need a recipe change to veggie burger and sweet potato fries to return."}
{"text":"This was an awesome meal.  Very unique in their approach.  I will be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"Good quality stuffed burgers. I tried the mac and cheese burger with jalepenos. It was cooked well and their special sauce is also good. I was kind of let down when they asked if I wanted lettuce and tomatoes and was provided with a small piece of lettuce and half a tomato on the side of the burger (Kind of defeats the purpose of having someone else make my burger.) The wait was also a little long but overall worth it."}
{"text":"These burgers are so great, and they have amazing customer service. 
The burgers take some time to cook but are worth it. I highly recommend the spicy Mac and cheese bites."}
{"text":"Ordered tonight thru Uber Eats. I'm thinking this is just another burger place. Burgers are my favorite food, but haven't found anything in the valley that matches back home in Boston.

I order the Caprese  burger on a brioche bun... man it was like biting into heaven. Floored.. absolutely floored. Melts in your mouth, and full of flavor. Wow.. just wow. You've got a new customer for life!!

{"text":"Best food ever. Took stuffed burgers to the next generation. I had to add this establishment to yelp there great. Staff , food, and service is hands down the best. Steve Lucas a customer for life. Thanks guys see yeah tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Wow this place far exceeded my expectations for a fast food burger joint. The patties themselves were so tasty they don't need to be stuffed but I won't complain! I got the Reuben burger and it was to die for messy and juicy just the way I like a good burger. We also got the Mac and cheese bites and some of the onion straws. The Mac and cheese bites are to die for onion straws I could do without. Got the pizza cookie for desert and while it tasted good it was incredibly small especially for a couple to share maybe a shake is the better way to go next time all in all very happy and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was great! I am not much of a burger person but loved this place. When we got there the first thing we were asked was if we had been there before. And when we said no, the girl was kind enough to explain everything. Which I love when places do that. 
She explained everything is stuffed to order. Had us taste their signature outrageous sauce. Which my guess is siracha, ketchup, and mayo? It was pretty good too. 
We split and order of the fries added bacon and cheese. I had the jalapeño and bacon Mac n cheese burger and husband had the three cheese. 
Very good. Will be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time in; the BBQ MOB chicken burger was delicious, the veggie burger is also amazing!! The service was spectacular, Chase was very helpful, friendly, polite and very through at his job! Will be back again soon and hope to see Chase there again!"}
{"text":"Had my son's 18th bday here by his choice. They did a GREAT job. Highly recommended!  We had a large party and they were completely set up and ready for us when we got there and they attended to everyone incredibly well"}
{"text":"Great burger with tons of options, I got a burger stuffed with cheese and pineapple with a fried egg on top and the sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"In Mesa, AZ for my niece's wedding!  I had the Reuben and my wife had the southwest!  My cousin had the mac n cheese and my brother had bacon blue cheese stuffed burger.  We are all from MI and have had stuffed burgers from Detroit and Saugatuck areas.  These were cooked perfectly and were well stuffed compared to others we've tried.  The cheese inside was perfectly gooey.  I would come back if I didn't have other restaurants on my food bucket list, while here.  Food came out in reasonably expected speed.  We then decided to order milkshakes, they were good but nothing special on those but did take longer than expected.  Overall the food flavor was great and we all would come back when we visit AZ again!  Regretfully I didn't try the green beans nor a chicken stuffed burger which were highly suggested to us by family we visited later.  Oh yeah the fries were battered style fries which we all liked!"}
{"text":"WOW!!!! If you haven't been here you need to come! Awesome burgers, nice clean modern style burger joint. They have there special sauce that I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Date night with the hubby.  We wanted something quick and not too expensive. We were expecting a decent burger... Instead we got EXCEPTIONAL!!!  The staff was very friendly. The food was hot and delicious!!!  I had to take half my burger home!! We will definitely be back to try other stuffed combinations."}
{"text":"Nice store. Good menu selection. The fries and green beans were excellent. The burgers, however, were disappointing. From the menu descriptions and price, I expected a large, gourmet burger. I ordered a cheese burger which was well presented, but taste and quality wasn't with the cost. My daughter ordered one of the stuffed burgers and she was also disappointed. I see that they are getting good reviews, so maybe we were there on an off day. It's still probably worth a try, but don't pass on the yummy sides."}
{"text":"Been meaning to stop in and check this place out since it appeared while waiting for the light to turn green. Avid burger consumer and an appreciation for food done right.  I make stuffed burgers myself but Stufrageous opens up the floodgates when it comes to their signature creations. Granted I've only had the one burger today.... I can assure you that your taste buds will be screaming something happy. Mac & Cheese stuffed with bacon and jollies was what was recommended so thats what I did with a side of fries. They knocked that burger and fries out of the park like Mark McGwire on the juice. Did I roll out of my seat when I was done comatose from portions the size of Texas and food that tasted like it was ground up gym shorts? Not even. I appreciated the love they put into the food, felt it was appropriately priced for the top notch meal I fell in love with this afternoon. We'll be back and +1 for awesome informative nice upbeat staff =)"}
{"text":"Decent burger not as great as I was thinking it was gonna be. Sort of a novelty having stuff inside the burger, the beef was maybe McD quality. Not sure how to pinpoint it but was very fine ground? Not your typical burger ground beef. Bottom bun had soaked up a lot of grease (You can see it in the pics) and we ate there so not like it was sitting for a while. All in all decent but not good enough for a second visit.  I had the Capris my wife and daughter had the Mac n cheese stuffed."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the music is so damn loud you can't hear yourself think. Asking the staff to turn it down a notch does nothing. With the open ceilings, the noise just reverberates and ruins the ambience. Have been there several times but this will be the last time. I heard others complain about the loud music too. If I wanted to hang out at a club, I would have gone to one. Sad because it's hard to find a good burger made the way I like it. Maybe the owners will read the Yelp review and address the issue."}
{"text":"The special sauce is pretty good. It's like fry sauce with a slight kick. I usually go with the 3 cheese burger made with chicken on a brioche bun. The fries are actually my favorite thing in the menu and a desert cookie is a great way to end it all. I went one time where they took a long time (my bad for going during my lunch break) and when they realize they made a mistake by making me wait they gave me a coupon for a free cookie on my next visit. Another time they got my order wrong and fixed it without question."}
{"text":"This place is okay. Overall, I was a little disappointed given the high rating and good Yelp reviews. My mistake was ordering things other than their featured items. I had a veggie burger and the sweet potato fries. I would not order either again. The veggie burger patty was pretty boring. They aren't able to stuff the veggie patty, but that's understandable in my opinion. 

What I really lost them stars was the fact that the sesame seed bun was dry and did not withstand my buger or my boyfriend's jalapeño popper burger. There's really no excuse for having crappy buns. 

Their regular fries were delicious though. And my boyfriend liked his jalapeño popper burger, despite the bun. It also was very clean and had a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Grab plenty of napkins! An afternoon Father Day's lunch turned into a delicious stuffed burger endeavor which resulted in a full stomach and a pile of napkins the size of a small brush pile. I love the concept of building your own stuffed burger. Look out Burger King, at Stufrageous I can totally have it my way. I chose the brioche bun for my base. The burger is of course big enough to stuff with all the goodies you want. I chose one of the signature burgers which was the jalapeño melt. This is a burger stuffed with jalapeños pepper jack cheese and American cheese. I chose to have the lettuce, tomato, and onions on the side free of charge. I did not choose a topping, but got the outrageous sauce on the side. I also got fries. I got a free regular soda because I checked in and spent $8.00 or more.

     The burger was medium well, just the way I like it. The burger was cut in half and laying in the basket cut side up. I think this was a subliminal suggestion as how to eat this thing. The cheese was ooey gooey and oozed out the sides. I tucked the lettuce, tomato, and onion neatly into each half drizzled the outrageous sauce on the burger and for good measures a couple shots of sriracha sauce. Now perplexed as to how to pick this monster up and manage a bite without loosing everything, it came to me. *Pay attention now* Don't try to eat it vertically or it all slides out. Pick it up as it lies in the basket and eat it more like you would a taco. As it is your fingers will be coated in juice, cheese, and sauce. Or you can be proper about it and just use a fork and knife.

    The burger was truly an adventure through burgertopia. It was very tasty, it was very messy, and it was very satisfying. The fact that I can customize the burger, makes my best burger list. Oh and the fries, too salty. I'll have to remember to ask for lightly salted next time."}
{"text":"The burgers are on the small side but the option for an extra patty or a larger one is available. Their crazy sauce is where it's at....definitely try it out if your'e here. There's so many options as to what you can put in your burger that it can be kind of overwhelming. Deliciously overwhelming."}
{"text":"Good food .. nice atmosphere .. great customer service .. well worth the wait .. delicious shakes!"}
{"text":"Made my own stuffed burger and loved the bun it came on.  Ingredients tasted fresh and the burger was delicious.  I really liked the outrageous sauce which was good both on the urged and the fries.  The service at the counter was helpful and patient when I didn't know what I wanted, and helped my kids get some Dum-Dum suckers.  Got the free soda for checking in on Yelp.  My only complaint was that I had to clean off a table for myself when I got there, when there were clearly plenty of workers around.  Otherwise, loved the place and the food and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite. Burger was awesome and I would recommend sharing a basket of fries between 3 people. Can't wait to try another burger"}
{"text":"Excellent burger.  Dont live in area and saw reviews so tried the Greek Burger.  Super fresh and tons of flavor...i liked it better without the spicy sauce i ordered on the side.  Would stop anytime I am in the area to try something else.  Fries really crispy and good too!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food for an over-the-counter burger joint.  Ordered a 8oz burger stuffed with grilled onions, bacon and cheddar.  Fries were seasoned well and crispy too.  Atmosphere was dead but that could be because I ate around 3pm.  Service was average.  

it was tasty and I would certainly try this place again."}
{"text":"dang good burgers!

found this place based on the other positive Yelp reviews and was quite satisfied!"}
{"text":"Tried this burger joint today with a few friends of mine. First things I noticed when walking in was the cleanliness of the restaurant, and the delicious smells coming from behind the counter, which was great watching cook up the goodness I was about to embark on. 

First friend got the caprese chicken burger on brioche, Mac and cheese bites, and a strawberry shake. She loved her meal, and couldn't stop raving about everything. I tried the Mac and cheese bites, and they were delicious, maybe not as good as Cheesecake Factory but I still enjoyed them. Almost forgot to talk about her shake, very good, and fresh strawberries in a shake and not a purée, gets my vote. 

My other two friends shared the rueben burger, and French fries. I do love a good rueben, so kind of jealous watching them eat haha. They didn't mention anything about the actual sandwich but the fries they got were so stinkin gooood! We all raved about the fries, they are like a mixture of rally's and Burger King, at least that's the best way I can describe them. Also, with the sauce they provide with them, oh my god, so bomb! 

On to me... I got the southwestern chicken burger on brioche. Pepper jack cheese, green chilies, and I added bacon and mayo. I will tell you this right now, the flavors were so there for this sandwich, I loved every bite! What I didn't know that kind of surprised me was that the chicken is ground meat, I was expecting a chicken breast sliced and stuffed with the stuffings. Listen, I wasn't  disappointed, just really confused hahaha. My fault, so I'm not gonna fault this burger joint for me not asking about the chicken.

I will be back again!

Oh yea! They also serve beer and wine, Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to eat! Friendly staff that was very helpful! If you like chicken or hamburgers try this place in Mesa. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"I love it here!  I have been twice and can't resist getting the Outrageous Fries with Bacon, Blue Cheese and Outrageous Sauce (which is amazing and should be eaten on everything).  They also serve China Mist Iced tea the flavor varies but it's always fantastic and very clean tasting.  The staff has been very friendly and helpful with any questions!"}
{"text":"Q:  How do you insult a hamburger patty? 
A:  Call it a meatball!

I ordered tasty Mac N Cheese with beef on the brioche bun, a basket of Outrageous Fries, and a side of Tempura Fried Green Beans.  Hey, I wasn't wearing skinny jeans today so I was ready to eat!

And boy did we eat.  That Mac N Cheese... lawdy, it was love at first bite.  It was cheesy, it had good seasoning, and the jalapenos were spice bombs littered throughout a juicy burger.  I also tried The Ruben.  Not bad.  It was kind of dry and I wasn't feeling it.  And so I devoured the MnC, took a few polite bites from the Ruben, and worked on eating all the green beans.  Those things are crack.  They might not even need the Outrageous sauce.  Aw yis!  The Outrageous Fries with cheddar and bacon were pretty delicious when they were hot but as soon as they got cold, it was a congealed mess.  Although cold, I did enjoy ripping out the giant chunks of cheddar and eating it.  #DontJudgeMe

All in all, I had a great lunch.  The wait time can test your patience and boy are they busy during lunch.  I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"About a week ago my kids and I tried this place since I had been reading the great reviews they had. It was soo good. I had the build your own burger which was with Mac and cheese American cheese with mushrooms. My girls both had build your own with pepperoni bacon and motz. They thought it was great too. We were so full we couldn't even eat the basket of fries we ordered but we managed to eat a few which were very yummy as well. Definitely a place we will come back to for sure."}
{"text":"Great find. We stopped in on a Tuesday, 2 pmish. You  order at the counter/cashier, they give you a number for your order, then sit wherever you like. The options include ground chicken rather than just ground beef. The Tempura green beans were crunchy, fresh, not overly breaded. i posted a pic of the lettuce wrapped Capri ground chicken burger. It had amazing
flavors, spices. The staff was nice, they bring your order to your table, and they come back to ask how everything is, and they smile. Make this a must try on your list of up and coming restaurants."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot. It's an interesting concept to put the toppings in between two patties. I ordered the Greek, subbed onions for the feta, and got it wrapped in lettuce. It was pretty darn good. My kids shared a hot dog and ate it all up. It was a good size. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff
 burgers  were greasy french fries were frozen watch Robert Irvine restaurant impossible
STOP mashing burger on the grill takes all the juice out
Do hand cut fries 
Wine burgers"}
{"text":"I had seen this place a couple times and finally decided to pull up yelp and read some reviews. After seeing all the positive reviews I made sure to make a go for it and I am glad I did. For this trip I decided to try the pastrami stuffed burger and it was superb. Cooked to perfection and they even threw in some fries since it was my first visit. What great customer service I received along with great food. Can't wait until my next visit."}
{"text":"Was my favorite for awhile. Switching to Lipton garbage tea was a mistake.  Can't come here anymore."}
{"text":"Burgers are literally stuffed with deliciousness mmmm I crave them makes my mouth water thinking about them! Yummy I've tried bc&b, southwestern and bbq and they are all great gatta get sweet pot fries with blue chz crumbles ranch and stufrageous sauce!!! Do it try it you'll love it!!"}
{"text":"To the Owner replying to my review, at least I didn't leave a negative review. Your response was quite unprofessional and rude.  Maybe I didn't choose the right one but next time I plan to try something else.  I enjoyed my meal even though the noodles was slightly overcooked. I did say I was coming back again in the future to try another burger, didn't I?  Hopefully this clears your confusion :]

So I found this joint on Yelp, not from Arizona but I wanted to try places that people were raving about. So decided to make this place my first place to eat after just driving for 6 hours from California. I may have expected more then what I encountered. So as we walked in we got greeted right away. You can choose your type of bun; brioche, sesame , lettuce and .. I forget. But you can either order from their signature menu or build your own stuffed burger. It could be what I ordered it sadly wasn't a \"wow\" factor. I have made the stuffed Mac n cheese burger from a recipe off buzzfeed at home so I guess I was too hopeful? I ordered the Mac n cheese stuffed burger. I feel like it would have been better if the Mac n cheese wasn't so mushy. (mushy as in over cooked) 
I upgraded the fries, to bacon and choice of cheese. It's really nothing to rave about that I haven't had yet. Especially their outrageous sauce is literally I believe Siracha mixed with mayo. 
Maybe next time I'll try a different burger. I do like their concept though. It just wasn't the best burger I have ever had."}
{"text":"Different... that's the best way to describe this place. It's more than your average burger joint offering a wide variety of toppings and \"stuffings\"  I will be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"SYOB - Stuff Your Own Burger

I first saw thus type of burger on the Food Network as a \"Juicy Lucy\" and tried to do it at home. 

Lots of combinations and selections,  we ordered the burger with Pastrami and Mushrooms inside, burger with Mac n cheese inside and the bbq mos  (mushrooms, onions and Swiss cheese). All burgers came in a round tin with a clear plastic lid with lettuce, tomato, onions and a pickle.

Burgers were fun and different and actually pretty good.

I liked the outrageous sauce, good flavor with a slight kick

Will be back again"}
{"text":"Burgers aren't my first choice for dinner. But really...it is always good to venture out and try something different right? I am glad that I did. Instead of ordering a traditional burger, I ordered one made the way I like it. I pick my own buns, ingredients, sauce and anything I want in it that is listed on the menu. Mine includes mozzarella cheese, medium beef, grilled onions, mushroom and jalapeno in it. The beef is juicy and meaty. I ordered it with a meal that comes with a large drinks and fries (you can choose different types of fries - I wish I knew about it when I ordered the meal). 

Except a restroom that isn't working because the toilet wouldn't flush, the general area is relatively clean and organized. I will definitely come back here again to try different types of burger."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend , he is workin in mesa so this was by our hotel,, its amazing so so good , best mac and pepper jack cheese bites  try with the house sauce , and cheddar and jalapeño burger was delish"}
{"text":"We love this place! But it's dangerous (calories, you know?).  The burgers are great, the fries are great and then the fried green beans.  Yum!
You can stuff your burgers with just about anything you want.  And there's a choice of buns too.  Finally I can get as much blue cheese on my burger as I want :)

The service is great, everybody is super nice.  But how to leave electronic tips when paying with a credit card???  I never have cash.  They need to fix this."}
{"text":"Horrible experience, first of it was my first time here and the cashier was super rude and rushing me even tho I was the only one in line. Second I was completely disgusted by the fact that my pickle was already bitten and put on my plate. The lettuce was yellow, the tomato was green and it was just a mess. The violation of health is enormous. I'm definitely reporting this..."}
