{"text":"Slow service for a restaurant in an area (an airport) where service is typically abbreviated And intended to be speedy.   Food was poor at best. I had a Shepard pie that was quite dry. Mozzarella cheese on top, not fully melted, breadcrumbs on top that were overly salty.   I would have had a better dinner at the dunk''n donuts."}
{"text":"This place isn't very good, but it didn't make me ill, so it has that going for it.  They have some of the most awful onion soup and tortilla soup I have every eaten / tried.  Both soups arrived cold (not hot, not warm, not lukewarm... cold) and were just gross anyways.  I also had a ham and cheese on pretzel bread sandwich, which was OK.  My colleague got the shepherd's pie and it wasn't very flavorful and the peas were very undercooked.  Avoid The Pub.  CLE has better sit down food options."}
{"text":"Drinks is what u expected.. but what i dislike is NOT putting a price on their drinks which totally tricked me and not cool. I guess it doesn't matter if i come back since it is at the airport. So please beware."}
{"text":"The Pub at the Cleveland airport is probably one of the biggest surprises that I have ever been hit with. A world-class burger at a local airport. I have a history with airport burgers and I find them to be nothing too special most of the time.  The Pub Burger features a pretzel bun, bacon, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, bacon, and a flavorful piece of beef. Pretzel buns and cheddar are always a winning combination when combined with a burger. Add some bacon and well-charred beef patty and you have winner. The Pub pretzel bun was one of the few I have ever seen with salt on top, which actually helped to enhance the mouthwatering profile of this already well decked out burger.  If you are looking for the best airport burger in America I'm willing to be it is at The Pub. Compared to the best burgers I have eaten the beef could have been a little more juicy, but this burger was still amazing."}
{"text":"This place has an EXCELLENT atmosphere. Always has great club soccer on. The beer list is good, all the waitresses have been super nice. Overall the food is solid but come for the beer, friends and atmosphere.  Bonus - They have a cask for cask conditioned beers... they really need to get it fixed!"}
{"text":"I've lived in England on two separate occasions during my life and despite those who think The Pub is over the top, I love coming here. I will admit that I'm not sure if I've ever ordered anything other than the fish and chips, but it's because it's that good. They have a new menu though that might persuade me to venture off one of these days. Someone I ate with got the pot roast and said it was amazing.   It's really nice to be able to get a decent pull of a real British bitter beer off the tap, and their scotch prices are reasonable too - an added bonus.   Authentic? The foods good and the floors are clean, but otherwise, absolutely. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Really liked the country fried chicken. Gravy was really good. Nice server, attentive but not overbearing. Eggs cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"I stopped in The Pub and wished I had gone to Great Lakes Brewing instead. I had the Shepherd's Pie which was more like a dish of ground beef with vegetable soup and potatoes on top. The service was OK.  The place still has great atmosphere and feels like a pub, but I found the food disappointing."}
{"text":"One of the better airport pub/restaurants at the Cleveland Airport.  The place has a nice food & drink selection and the service is decent.  They get you in and out and all the important games are always on the TV.  If I have a long layover in Cleveland this is the place I will be at."}
{"text":"A lot of character and a really smooth Black and Tan waiting for the snow delays to end.  The waitress staff was friendly and the fish and chips are on my list for next time.  Big pieces of haddock malt vinegar and salt is the ticket.  Waiting for my next trip."}
{"text":"As a fan of the Pub when it was in Rocky River, Ohio, I'm delighted to stop here every time I'm flying out of Cleveland; which is often enough since I'm active duty Army. I usually stop in around 1400 hours and I order at least a beer or two and an entree.  I learned the hard way that you do NOT want to order a burger here. I did it once and I was disappointed because my favorite burger, the Young's Double Chocolate Stout BBQ Burger, was severely under-par compared to the one from Rocky River and the one currently in Beachwood. On my next trip out of Cleveland I spoke with the barkeep about it. His suggestion was to get the fried things, such as the fish and chips or chicken and chips.  I adore the Pub's fish and chips. I always have since the Rocky River days and always will. The barkeep was right. The fried pickles were on point too! I ALWAYS order my fish and chips with a side of the Young's Double Chocolate Stout BBQ sauce since the sauce goes really well with the chips.  The last time I was home and flying out of Cleveland I was sociable with the barkeep, not ordering cheap stuff mind you (two beers, a double of Glenlivet, and fish and chips will do that), and the barkeep gave me a free glass from Great Lakes Brewing Company. It was really nice of the guy to do that. He also pointed me to Concourse C where Great Lakes Brewing Company has a bar that sells six-packs INSIDE the secure area that you CAN take on your plane. Thank you sir! I cannot get Cleveland beers in Georgia and knowing that was a special treat!"}
{"text":"The pot roast was great. Huge bowl and couldn't finish it. Got my veggies for the day without salad, though.  Second time here and will visit again no question. Awsome selection of beers. For airport food, I'd rate it above most anything similar at any other airport. Really friendly staff and they have what most places lack. A simple thank you."}
{"text":"We have been here three times.  Every time we have loved the atmosphere and the food and drink.  We had the same server on two different visits and LOVED her, she was great (of course cannot remember her name!!  She kind of looks like Pam from The Office though)....  On the other occasion, our server was very unpleasant but due to the place being so much fun, we just tried to ignore it.  The appetizer goat cheese dip with marinara and almonds is TO DIE FOR!!!   Warning:  you may not be hungry for your meal after eating it!  Cannot wait to go back when the weather is warm to sit on the gorgeous open patio."}
{"text":"We stopped here several years ago before we flew out of Cleveland.  I noticed the fish and chips someone near me had ordered.  He said they were delicious. So, naturally, I ordered them too. These were sooooo good. So good in fact, that we are flying back to Cleveland this week and one of the highlights I am looking forward to is....those fish and chips. PUB,  here I come."}
{"text":"2nd time here and will be last. Slooooww service. Was not even acknowledged when I sat at bar. Servers were chatting in plain sight. Left and went to another restaurant in the airport."}
{"text":"Late on a Sunday is probably not the best time to be trying out new restaurants, but I was changing planes on my way to Boston and didn't have much choice. I had two hours to make my connection so I had my choice of any place in the airport to eat. I chose that The Pub because it seemed to have the best reviews. When I walked in, there was neither a hostess nor a sign inviting me to sit myself. Since I was alone, I decided to sit at the bar, in part because there were electrical outlets at knee level where I could recharge my phone. The barn looked like it hadn't been wiped down recently and there was a toothpick where I ch. Spoiler alert: it was still there when I left.  When the barmaid (who appeared to be the only staff on duty this evening) finally showed up, I ordered a local beer made by the Great Lakes Brewing Company. I don't know the type of beer, all the menu said was the name of the brewery. I also ordered bangers and mash because if you are in a faux-British pub, you should order British pub food. Alongside the bangers and mash, there were also peas and carrots and a nontraditional vinaigrette salad.  Once the food finally arrived, everything started to look up. First, the vinaigrette salad was quite tasty, despite the lower leaves being soaked in the gravy. The carrots were shredded and laid atop the peas, and despite the lack of sauce it was all quite tasty as well. The bangers (that's sausage for you non-Brits) were spicy and were apparently skinless, as I could easily cut them with my fork. Finally, the only problem I had with the mashed potatoes was the relatively small quantity served on the plate. The plate was rather crowded, but I would preferred more potatoes and fewer peas.  Overall, I give this establishment one star based on the quality of service, and five stars based on the quality of the food and beer."}
{"text":"Wow, the worst service I have ever experienced in my entire life. When I arrived there were maybe 5 people sitting at the bar and nobody at the tables. After some time waiter D came out and took my order. Two eggs over easy, sausage, English muffin and a coke., then she took another mans order that came in after me. A lady comes in sits near me and a man takes her order. Pretty soon my waiter comes out with my order, bangers and a coffee. Not! She tries to give it to the lady near me who tells her no I didn't order that from you. She comes back to take my order again, mean while the man gets his food, eats it and leaves. The lady gets her food. Another man who came in after me, pays for his coffee, cancels his order and leaves. Out comes my order again, scrambled eggs, sausage and muffin. Not! The lady that came in after me pays and leaves. Finally out comes my eggs on a platter with nothing else. Un frickin believable."}
{"text":"I will be honest, I am a big fan of British culture, from their television shows to the way they dress. Something about that little island interests me. So when I heard of The Pub I had to venture.  We went on a Friday night, and it was not crowded at all, but there was a high school reunion on the patio so that was a kind of a bummer. Though the interior is very awesome, you can sit on couches and old looking chairs that seem like they are from your grandmothers house, and the tables are old wood looking, very neat.  The service is pretty good, quick, knowledgeable, and dress in kilts. The beer list is massive, which you would expect from a place called \"The Pub.\" The menu is very British Isle, sheppard's pie and fish and chips are notable ones. The only problem with the meals, are the portions, incredibly small, I was shocked when they brought the food out. You get maybe a dozen extra large steak fries and then the main food, plus the prices are high for what you get. The food is nothing great very mediocre and forgettable. I would give it 4 stars for the beer list and the atmosphere, but the lack of great food and portion its gets a 3. Certainly a place to go out drinking, not a place to eat."}
{"text":"In this era of crowded planes, long lines, tight connections and no onboard meal service, I'm willing to get up an hour early for morning flights to get through check-in and TSA and enjoy a sit-down breakfast at the airport.  Even though it often means getting up at Oh-Dark-Thirty, I'd rather enjoy a full service breakfast than sleep an extra hour and then stand in a long line for designer coffee and a stale biscuit.  I thought I had found that place this morning at the airport in Cleveland when I saw The Pub just inside the secured area past TSA.  The manager was behind the bar and quickly recognized me and asked me what I wanted to drink - so far, so good.  Then the waitress came to the table and said, \"You gave me your credit card, right?  I can't seem to find it.\"  I thought it odd, since I had yet to order, but I assured her my credit card was not MIA and proceeded to order my meal.  A few minutes later, the manager came out with the bill (no food in tow) and said they hadn't charged me for the coffee (in actuality, they had - unless Ohio imposes a 29% sales tax.)  I accepted the bill and paid it, including a tip of more than 20% (for service yet to be received.  I always hope a nice \"pre-tip\" is to insure prompt service.)  Fifteen minutes in, the coffee cup is dry and the waitress comes out with somebody else's credit card and bill and asks me if I can sign it.  She had no clue which patrons were where, or what their service needs were.  By now, my stomach is growling and I'm getting edgy whether or not I'll have time to eat the meal and get to the gate on time - that airport has some long hikes to the outer gates.  A solid half hour went by and still no signs of food - I just might go to my grave not knowing what a \"banger\" is for breakfast.  I asked the waitress when my food would be coming out, as I had a flight to catch.  She was gobsmacked by the question - \"What food?  You've already closed out your bill!\"  She seemed incredulous that a customer could possibly expect their meal after the bill had been closed out.  The manager was apologetic and gave me a full cash refund.  I offered a few choice words of advice before heading to the gate, including a hearty \"Good luck trying to eat here!\" to the ashen-faced gentlemen who had sat down at the adjacent table.   Airport cuisine comes with the lowest level of expectations, so it is always a pleasant surprise to find a good one.  IAH (Houston) has a bunch of good choices.  The United terminal in Denver has a French restaurant that serves an amazing lox and bagels platter.  LAX has a few good ones and I'm very impressed with a couple restaurants at the renovated terminal at Logan Airport (Boston).  I'm sad to report that, even grading on an airport restaurant curve, my experience today with The Pub merits no higher than one star."}
{"text":"Great service on 6-12-14. Horribly overcooked fish for the fish and chips. Salvaged a lemon wedge size of the fish to maintain my strength to crawl to Dunkin Donuts and get a coffee afterwards."}
{"text":"I wanted a \"proper\" filling meal and received just that at The Pub. The pot roast topped with bordelaise, chives, whipped potatoes, peas & carrots was yummy! It wasn't the best I've ever had but it was damn good for airport food!"}
{"text":"Good beer choices, wait, great beer choices for an airport bar. The beer selections cover most of the UK and would be pretty good located most anywhere, actually. The food was decent, and the fries pickles (breaded spears) are the only way to go. Friendly, fast service too. Go Pub!"}
{"text":"Great place, great food.  Friendly service and very attentive. Busy in the evenings. Been here several times. We have brought our out of town friends and they loved it. Recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"This places stays true to its English roots - bad, flavorless food.    I ordered the hot turkey sandwich which came open faced with a small pile of turkey and your standard lettuce/tomato/onion.  I could have made this sandwich at home in two minutes.  My co-worker is practically a garbage disposal but chose not to finish his stuffed mushrooms AND this was eating at 3 in the afternoon after missing lunch.    The pub does have a cool layout with a \"beer garden\" and good beer selection.  Stop for a drink but skip the food."}
{"text":"This is my fourth time here. It went from decent service to abysmal. It became harder and harder to get the waitresses attention, until it has reached the point where the food order I placed never came. When I asked for it to be taken off my bill she wanted to know who took my order, even though her name was on the friggin receipt! I was only there for 30 minutes, and there were less than 15 people and three servers. I'm done with this place. I keep getting a server who is wired or on something.  Great beer selection! Can't tell you what the food tastes like."}
{"text":"My wife and I stoped here for the Lobster Rolls and a cocktail, very nice, the service was good, the Lobster Rolls were excellent and the cocktails were just ok, over all a good experience and we'll be back."}
{"text":"It's a British restaurant that doesn't serve hot tea!   Breakfasts are good and cheap and fast."}
{"text":"Decent food for the airport, and the beer was cold and the service was good and quick.  I'll eat here again when passing through the Cleveland airport."}
{"text":"A cool, perfect summer night led me and my husband over to the Pub. We were in the area and I had never been there before, though he had on more than one occasion to watch World Cup and to get his beer on.  I like how there are three sort of disparate sections to this place. There's the swanky, carpeted, quiet dining area; the black-and-white checkered floor area with booths surrounding the (humongous) bar; and the lively, family-laden outdoor patio space. We were seated outside (our choice) by a tall blond guy in a kilt. Now that's service.  Being a Monday, there was this cool trivia quiz going on. We came too late to get involved, but it seemed pretty fun with questions that weren't obnoxiously obscure, yet not too easy either. Some examples were: What was Nemo's dad's name in Finding Nemo? A cynophobe is afraid of what animal? The Wailing Wall is in what city? etc. They also had a lightening round, where players had a list of oft-used quotes from old TV shows and had to identify which shows they came from, as well as a music round, where 10 snippets of semi-popular songs had to be identified along with their artists. I would like to drag a group of Yelpers here on a Monday because I am certain we would friggin' dominate.  The food was awesome. BUT we didn't order gourmet. I knew walking in to have very low expectations. This was going to be one of my last \"I'm pregnant; I am going to eat a crappy comfort food meal\" experiences. SO: fried pickles and fish and chips it was.  The fried pickles were just .. (sorry Brandon) AMAZING. And there were six spears! They were piping hot, crispy, and came with a great ranch-type sauce. Much better than those at Buckeye, although I like those too.  Now, I really should say that I only order fish and chips from a place like this..a \"British pub.\"  However authentic or inauthentic that actually is for this place, it doesn't really matter. I knew the fish and chips were going to be great, and they were. Huge chunk of cod or whatever it was, with a thick batter. There was definitely a great proportion of fish to breading too - it wasn't overwhelmed by the batter, which is great. The chips were much less appealing than the fish. In fact, I hated the fries. Doesn't mean I didn't eat 'em, though!  My husband had the same meal as I did, and also enjoyed one of their MANY tapped beers (the bastard). I am certain that I will be adding the Pub to my \"Beer Buddies\" list just as soon as I can get a cold one down my gullet again."}
{"text":"UPDATE !!!  My hubby and I stopped in to this cute restaurant again before heading to the LV Knights game against Ottawa. Perfect location and great food on a Friday evening. Love the prices !!! Most places on the strip are priced WELL above the average persons pocketbook. My hubby and i ordered a dozen oysters each. The chef recommended one order from the west coast and one from the east coast. Great suggestion since my hubby and i got to sample a little from both. We headed on to the fried pickles (seriously yum !!) and the fried green beans. Another yum !! Fish and chips for entree was a very large piece of cod that was cooked to perfection. We skipped dessert because that was more than enough food for both of us. Kudos to our excellent waitress \"J\" !! She was both attentive and charismatic and I'd steal her from here if i had a restaurant !!!    BTW ... i love to review places that are either a 5 Star or a 1 Star in my humble opinion. And you can rest assure my review is legit.   Great experience all the way around. My hubby and I ordered several items so we could share. Highly recommend the fish and chips. Batter was crispy and the fish was perfectly flaky. The chips were hot and fresh and also crispy. The bangers and mash were so yummy. The flavors in the sausage were exactly how I remembered them tasting in our favorite London Pub. Ordered the sliders and honestly had to take them to go because we had entirely too much food. But they were delicious reheated for a midnight snack. That's what vacations are all about right ??!!"}
{"text":"Nice spot conveniently right inside a security gate.  Good selection of English/Irish/Scottish draught & bottled beers. Great sandwiches.  Whatever sandwich you get, try the chips or fries."}
{"text":"Soooo...not Todd English's place anymore which in all honesty isn't the worst thing in the world. Todd English's food was decent but all I ever really came for was nickel beer night back in the day. I'm a vegas local born and raised, and it's nice to go to a place right across they way from where I work that has awesome pub food. The menu has a lot of great options (try the beet salad and the lobster roll) as well as some friendly staff. My coworkers and I have come here quite a few times for lunch and have never been disappointed. I tell all my clients!"}
{"text":"My friend and I have visited the Pub before, and wanted to return for brunch. The Aria website, and google, both state that it opens at 9am on Saturdays, so we waited outside till 920am, then I tried the door to see if it was open. A few minutes later a server popped her head out and snapped at us \"we don't open till 10!\", and slammed and locked the door. Sadly, we did not feel welcomed to wait till 10am, and we were discouraged from eating here. Rude service before we even entered the Pub. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was good and beer selection was good. But service was sub par. Too busy for just two bartenders. Last 20oz beverage was served in a pint glass. By the time waitress came back around, had to get on my flight. Didn't even bother telling her. I let the tip do the talking."}
{"text":"I was really hoping I'd love this place but reading the reviews I had some reservations. Well the service leaves a lot to be desired although after awhile one of the bartenders Catherine seemed to catch up but I did notice a lot of people sitting at tables walked to the bar requesting their check because they hadn't seen their servers not a good sign.   I was planning on having a few beers and a bite to eat but after scanning the menu several times and watching the meals that came from the kitchen I decided not to risk it. The food presentation from what I saw was poor. So I paid my tab and moved on. Beers on draft were $8.00 it was good so that earned one star the layout and atmosphere earned the second star. Unfortunately they haven't taken full advantage of this prime location to bad. I might return for the beer."}
{"text":"Have been coming to this place every year for the past 6 years. While on this past trip I was told they parted ways with Todd English and are no longer affiliated.  Had two meetings pre arranged, and I thought I was going to the TE Pub.  Food and menu are completely new, food was horrible. Bar is basically the same, but food is completely different and sub par at best. Disappointing.  Only go there for drinks."}
{"text":"Super cool place to grab a drink or bar bite especially while shopping. Really conveniently located it's in the heart of so much action. They have SUCH a great beer selection and a really creative cocktail menu. Pretty big place so lots of room for big groups too. Really awesome pub and I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Awful,  just awful. If this is what Pub Food is like, it's a good reason to never go to the U.K.  Started with a bad bloody mary, for which I paid for a double.  Thick, pasty mix with no vodka despite the \"double\".  Do the math, twice nothing is nothing.  Pretzel burger is dry on dry.  With overdone, cold onion strings and the nastiest imitation cheese-whiz on the planet.  I'll give them 2 stars only because I had a place to charge my phone while I ate and wrote this review.  Oh, did I mention the poor service?  All that for a $30 lunch.  Aaarrrggghhh........"}
{"text":"Walked around the Cleveland airport for a bit to find a restaurant to have breakfast in. I saw The Pub and was glad! The joint was pretty much empty and I was able to seat myself. A kind waitress came over and brought me water and took my order. I wanted the egg platter and asked if there was another option other than getting it with meat on the side. I asked if there was a fruit option and she said no. That's a bit disappointing to me! So, I just asked for the eggs, potatoes, and toast. Within 5ish minutes my food came out. The potatoes were hot, they'd just been deep fried. I'm fine with that. The eggs were warm, not too hot, but I understand how hard it is to keep eggs hot without using a heat lamp. The toast was pretty cold, which I also don't care too much about. To my surprise there were several tomato slices on the side of my plate, which she must have subbed in for the lack of meat. That was kind of her, and it made the breakfast a bit more English! Everything was tasty, and I was glad to be able to get a nice breakfast before my connection. I'd probably stop back in here for breakfast if in Cleveland again. The service was just fine and the food was good!"}
{"text":"ZERO STARS!  Ordered a Guinness got something else, ordered a salad, sat for 45 minutes never got my salad and left!  Worst restaurant EVER!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever !! Been here several times and none of the bartenders actually want to be there."}
{"text":"This place was very good.  We stopped in after a very long morning.  We were not starving but we were hungry.  Definitely worth a try if you're in the area.  Their menu is just the right size,  not so long that you can't decide."}
{"text":"Not bad for inside an airport! I typically expect my airport dining experiences to involve mediocre food and shotty service, but this was not the case at The Pub.  My husband and I were able to snag a large round table by an outlet so we had plenty of room to hop on our laptops, charge up, and enjoy some lunch before our flight home. Our waitress was very friendly (and funny!) and our food and drinks came out fast. I'm sure this is standard for them considering everyone is trying to catch a flight.  We both ordered double bloody Marys. I mean, why not? It was Friday after all! These bevies were pretty no-frills and included I believe just a lemon and lime. The mix itself was not my favorite, but I chugged it down nonetheless. No Tito's will go to waste!  To eat I had the ham and Swiss sandwich on a pretzel roll and this was delicious! It came with fries and everything really hit the spot. Comfort food at its finest.   Prices are what you'd expect in an airport, so no surprises there. Definitely worth a visit if you have time to kill at the airport."}
{"text":"This was a great bar located at the CLE airport. Great service and great beers. Nice to have a great place to have a beer or bite to eat before the flight."}
{"text":"I thought for airport food it was pretty good.   I was happy to see a spinach salad on the menu-best of all you could sub it as a side instead of fries and only was a dollar more.   I had the pretzel sam with Swiss and mustard. It was a little greasy but it was good! Onions and mushrooms were cooked well and plenty of meat.   One of the better options at CLE Hopkins.  I didn't try any drinks but they had a full menu with specialty features from England,Scotland and Ireland. Pretty large bar and has a pub feel to - can almost feel like your not at the airport!"}
{"text":"This has become one of our favorite places to get a pint.  Great place in the winter or summer. Gated patio for the warmer months. Flat screen tvs are nestled in corners to watch games, but not so obtrusive that they annoy non-game watchers like myself.   Atmosphere is constructed like a big old Irish or London pub. High backed booths, big  round tables in the back for groups,  high chairs wrapped around the long bar.  I enjoy the impressive draught beer list featuring selections from England, Scotland, Europe, Ireland and America. You can get a sampler if you are indecisive like me. They also have a pretty solid wine,specialty drink menu, and feature single malt scotchs.  The food menu changes seasonally while maintaining a few regular items. The curry chips, steak fries with a selection of curry dipping sauces, are a must try  and a year round staple menu The  Classic pub fare fish and chips are quite good and a hearty portion. The pub pretzel bun is another favorite.  There are limited vegetarian options. There's a portobello sandwich that sounds like it's given some thought. They have a handful of fish items like ahi tuna sliders, a salmon panini, and the previously mentioned fish and chips. Last time we were there I had the pumpkin bisque soup. I love pumpkin."}
{"text":"We fly out of CLE quite a bit and the airport was pretty empty this morning. Only 4 other people in the whole restaurant. Waited for 15 minutes while a server kept making annoying noises, as if to let the whole place know she was frustrated. Never once did anyone come to our table, tell us that they'd be right with us, offer us a drink while we waited...nothing. Disappointing, but we headed to Panini's and had a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Been to the pub several times and it is solid pub food. The service is always quick and so is the food service. Food is at your table honestly probably within 10 minutes of ordering. I've tried the pub burger, the Ruben, the breakfast sandwich, and the French dip. I really have no complaints about any of them. The thing they all have in common is that they're all relatively simple and classic but very, very good! Too many places nowadays have too many different flavors packed into their dishes. A burger doesn't need a zillion things on it to be good, it just needs good ingredients, and I feel like that's what the pub has. Also the fries are seriously good! They're crunchy without being hard and still soft in the middle. Great place for a couple beers and some good food!"}
{"text":"When passing through Hopkins International, go ahead and skip the Pub. I was drawn to it because it looks cool and relaxed. However, my bartender ruined the experience. My fiance and I were undecided about our order, which seemed to irritate the bartender.  She made a rude comment to a coworker about the fact that my fiance decided to walk around and see what was on tap. She seemed to have an attitude during our entire visit. The overpriced and underwhelming food combined with the rudeness makes the Pub worth missing"}
{"text":"Was there this past weekend for the 2010 pub mini meet and they were more than welcoming. Lots of people. The server said they were short staffed but I couldn't tell. The service was excellent and my beer glass was never empty. Had the spinach dip and pita. Good! Had the fish and chips and wow, best I've ever had I think. Sat outside and though there was a little rain, it was a nice seating area. Can't wait until 6/4/11!"}
{"text":"Tony, thank you for your response, I will certainly give the Pub another shot. (Just beef up that Belgian and English beet menu...)"}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here ahead of Aria's 7:00 poker tournament (finished 68 out of 160 entrees, out of the money).  I had the burger and my friend had the prime rib sandwich.  Neither was bad but neither exactly set the world on fire either.  This is roughly average and there are better sandwich and burgers in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I was so pleased coming to The Pub after it's been revamped!! Thankfully, the new staff (maybe new management or Chef?) changed up the menu and made some amazing changes! Our meals were full of flavor and came out extremely quick. I was very pleased with the service and the friendly staff. I would absolutely recommend this place!  **LOVE the new changes in this establishment!! Keep up the awesome work guys!! :)"}
{"text":"Not a fan of the new renovation. My wife and I came here on every Vegas trip for  the lobster roll and free popcorn. Now no free popcorn anymore, the lobster roll is meh, and the service was super slow. I had the pretzel, that was pretty good but not worth the trouble of going out of our way to come here. Probably won't be back, tried Momkfuku in the Cosmo and that may be the new regular. RIP Todd English P.U.B."}
{"text":"The Pub is absolutely maddening to me.  It is hands down one of the most inconsistant restaurants I've ever been to in my life!  There's something up in the kitchen that I can't quite explain, because on the night's when they are at their busiest is when I have gotten some great meals.  On the slower nights I've visited the food was subpar.  The Bangers and Mash has been the only consistant meal on their menu that I've had.  I've been let down countless times by their sheppherd's pie - oily, gritty, and lifeless.  They have some curries on the menu, and I know that in the UK curry dishes are all the rage, but it just doesn't seem right.  The rest of the menu is a tweaked or modified variation of other traditional pub fare.  As far as dessert goes I've never been able to make it past the Jamaican Cheesecake.  Thumbs up!  While the menu and atmosphere are a bit gimmicky (guys wearing kilts) - especially after repeated visits - the selection of bourbon and scotch is nothing short of impressive.  The bar itself is a bit unconfortable as retail space is a precious commodity.  It seems like every 6' there is a huge black pillar that does nothing but take away  from the bars surface area, and creats an unneeded congestion.  They have ample seating on the patio, and an area inside with large wingback chairs to enjoy a pint like blue blooded royalty.  I will say this though.  The ONLY REASON that they are getting 3 stars from me is because of their bloody mary's.  For the love of all that is holy they have some incredible mix that can be bought by the bottle to take home with you.  The real key to what they're doing is adding a quick splash of Guiness into the bloody mary's.  For me it works, and works really well."}
{"text":"Came here to the back lounge for a get-together with people coming and going. I had a good time with the company, but unfortunately, the service was not very attentive to us.  It took a while for our servers to take our orders, bring our food, bring our checks, etc. We found that many people would wonder out loud where the waiter/waitress was and that they had been waiting for their check for a while. Granted, it's quite a task to serve a get-together like this, but there's something wrong when I keep hearing the same complaint over and over.  The pub sliders were pretty good (with the side of green beans), but a little overpriced. The goat cheese app was just ok. They sliced up pieces of pita for the creamy goat cheese -- I felt like they took a special spread and made it just avg because of the lack of seasoning or even freshness of the pita.  Drinks were good - I had a 10oz chocolate stout and was pretty satisfied with it.   I like the idea of the pub being British and all, but overall it's just ok."}
{"text":"I know British food isn't known for its exciting flavor profiles, but this was ridiculous. The veggie burger was grey in color and taste and had the flavor of nothing. The pepper jack cheese tasted like rubber. The brioche bun was actually good. Then again, so was the Diet Coke, so that's not saying much. The dryer was down so I had to get a wilted side salad instead of fries. I'd this awful food is the impression Cleveland is giving visitors, Cleveland should be ashamed of itself."}
{"text":"Really great breakfast and they open at 5am. It's fantastic they open early, even on Sunday's. It's hard to find a nice place in a restaurant and this place is definitely nice. Clean too. Prices aren't bad and staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch yesterday.  What a delight!!! Every staff member was so nice.  The food was delicious. If you like calamari?  Theirs is a must. It is the best I've had.  We had fish and chips. I will definitely return. The friendly environment itself was so inviting."}
{"text":"Ordered their local IPA which was good and forgot the name of it. Also ordered their wings, 5 were sweet asian and the other was curry. Both were a bit on the salty side but the size of the wings were bigger than you normally would see."}
{"text":"Delicious fish and chips, good service, generous portions! Would definitely recommend this as a stop when in the airport."}
{"text":"Was excited to meet friends here for Sunday brunch. Their website says they open at 9 but apparently this is not the case. Had to go to Yelp to learn they open at 10.  Should not be too hard to keep your website up to date."}
{"text":"Went there for our lunch during a long layover. The space was crowded with patrons. We stood at the entrance not knowing what to do since there were no one to greet us. It would be helpful if there was a sign to let us know.   We had the fish and chips. It was delicious and the tartar sauce was great. The plate was big too!   Our experience was good aside from the fact that people were confused at the entrance and when they're full they don't make an effort to clear the tables or let the customers know there's some people finishing. People ended up having to sit at dirty tables that was left by the previous patrons."}
{"text":"We had two restaurants in our terminal wing that looked sketchy and had terrible reviews. Walked down a bit to find the Pub..thank goodness. Great food and very good service in a great old pub feel environment."}
{"text":"Huge bummer . Have eaten here in the past. The corned beef was from a can , cold , and tasted like cat food."}
{"text":"If you want a beer, it is probably the only place at the airport you can get one. For food, NO.  I thought this sit down pub would be better than a fast food vendor. NO. Chicken and chips is chicken tenders with cold fries. Celery was brown, not edible. I received tartar sauce instead of Ranch dressing. I would have been better off going to Chik Fil'A. Very disappointed. Cannot believe I paid $14 for really bad food."}
{"text":"We ate at The Pub soon after it opened in December.   The food was very good and all the wait staff were attentive and friendly.  It was a lovely evening.   I will definitely visit The Pub again when we are back in Las Vegas next time."}
{"text":"Very \"English\" Atmosphere, nice chairs and tables, the food is tasty and prices are reasonable, I had the traditional burger with swiss and mushroom, very good as for an airport restaurant, they didn't add onions and tomato so I had to ask!"}
{"text":"Was at The Pub tonight and tried for the first time the \"Pub Pizza.\"  OMG! I have to say this is the best item on the menu. It is big enough for two people to share and is truly great!  Can't wait to go back and have this again."}
{"text":"3.75 stars.  Decent airport pub food.  Heck, it's decent anywhere pub food.  A nice surprise.  Good burger.  Lots of beers and scotches.  Nice English style pub in Cleveland Hopkins Airport.  Best of the sit down places at CLE."}
{"text":"Leaving to go back home to Phoenix today....I checked out the gate directory after going through security and really didn't see a place to eat and have mimosas near my gate so I decided to eat here. Well....if I had known in the B area there is Quaker State....I would have gone there....it might bave been cheaper. I ate a basic breakfast... had I known the mimosas where about $12.00 I would have had one and moved on......so buyer beware. Each time I come to this place the bar counter is sticky and have to ask them to wipe it off. Service for most of the time is quick even though each time I've been here there has only been about 5 people in the place."}
{"text":"not bad for being stuck at the airport. The fish and chips were okay. I thought the ham and cheese pretzel was okay. I like that everything comes with a fried pickle, however you can tell that they are afraid of serving them lava hot(how I like them) so they let them cool off and lose their crispiness. Although the food is so-so considering its in an airport, the signature bloody mary is the best that I have ever had, hands down. I have had hundreds of variations and I can confidently say that. Plus, it comes with a Harp chaser. I tell you it is awesome."}
{"text":"Irish pub themed restaurant. The usual Irish dishes with some American sandwich and salad favorites.  The fish and chips featured a large piece of fried haddock--a bit on the greasy side but not offensive--average steak fries, and creamy cole slaw that neither fizzled nor excelled. Quick and attentive service. American breakfast menu in the morning."}
{"text":"Decent place. Staff was friendly and food was cooked to order and prompt. You really cannot ask for much else at an airport."}
{"text":"This place is pretty dismal. The service ? Don't expect a refill anytime soon.  Got multiple eyerolls   The food ? I don't know about all of it but the spinach flatbread was a total bust I was told it was like a pizza but no it lacked cheese like at all and it was pretty good other than that but not like a pizza  Overall this restaurant was subpar  Wouldn't recommend best part was the seating area"}
{"text":"This place used to be so good. They used to have the largest hot wings and the freshest oysters. Kind of went down hill after it changed to the pub. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Bartender friendly. Worst airport breakfast I've had. Thy put cold gravy on my food... So cold it was like eating coagulated savory meat jello. Not what you want hungover at an airport while drinking beer at 9 am. Eggs were cooked well but couldn't eat them Because I almost puked my smith wicks. Be careful here."}
{"text":"There are not many nice restaurants in Cleveland airport so this was the best option. But, OMG they have really bad servers and attitudes here. Must be a terrible place to work. You can hear the bitching and complaining by the employees.  We sat at a table that was dirty as it was the only one that we could all sit at and the server was upset, so upset he kept telling us he had other tables to clean and had other customers to attend to. Maybe his panties were all twisted because of the skirt he was wearing.  Finally went to the bar to order drinks and food. The bartender was great, courteous and friendly. She served us our drinks and food and with that she got over a 20% tip. We only ordered calamari which was crispy and fresh. The batter was lightly seasoned and not greasy and served with a sweet and sour and mustard sauce. Overall, note to waiters and servers it's not my fault that your bus boy is not doing his job or that you have too many table to service. My 1st impression is how you treated me as if we were not even there. Grow up and do your job and you will be rewarded with a nice tip. So for the rude server this place gets 1 star and for the bartender she gets 3 stars. Fair, I would say."}
{"text":"Good selection of draft beer. Beer cheese dip is excellent but surprisingly cold! Calamari is a little salty/seasoned for my taste. Fantastic service! A great place to spend a little time on a layover or delay."}
{"text":"Each time I fly into Cleveland Hopkins Airport, I welcome the opportunity to visit The Pub.  I highly recommend the Fish & Chips. It's the best item on the menu, and the best I have found. And I have tried many Fish & Chips. The bartender is also very knowledgable on the beers served. Give it a try the next time your at Hopkins."}
{"text":"Been here several times for appetizers drinks. Place never really gets overly crowded and loud, which is my kind of scene. Pretty interesting decor and lots of space. If you don't mind dudes in kilts, you'll enjoy this place. Chips and curry, wings, and the goat cheese appetizer are really good. Also try a \"Black Barrel\" from the bar: half Guinness and half Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale. Don't have to many, though, as those things are tasty but dangerous. Ample selection of whisky, too."}
{"text":"I'm more here for the ambiance than the food and service. Lighting and furniture make me feel like I am almost at a local bar chain and home, not some airport bar.   The good? Nice ambiance and the din of restaurant masks the feeling you are in an airport. I always sit at bar. Outlets are tucked underneath the bar, which is a plus if you are surfing the web.   The meh? Service is always slow. I've been coming here for about 4 months now, and it takes a solid 10 minutes to capture a server's attention. Another 15 minutes or so for food (I always order a salad). If you are in a rush or looking for attentive customer service, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Walked Out. My Wife, myself and one year old sat down to wait for our flight, have some burgers, fries and a pint for myself, it looked like a nice place and was better than dunkin donuts. It was also way past time for our son to eat too after the hour long car ride, checking bags, TSA security etc etc. My wife starts to breast feed him, within 2-3 minutes the waiter came over in what i thought was to take our order and said, \" i'm sorry but you will have to cover yourself\" we said we don't do that as i'm sure NONE of you put a sheet over your heads when you eat either, we stood and and said, \"Jesus Christ was breast feed....you should be ashamed of yourself\" and with a smug and jailed reply he said, \"have a nice day\". What is really creepy is why this guy was looking at my wife's breast? Nonetheless we went right outside in front of the place and continued to breastfeed in front of a police officer too. It all worked out because we found an awesome and welcoming little place called VINO VOLO were i enjoyed a glass of wine my wife had an amazing lava cake and alas our son, once again, could enjoy his milk. Just a post note to the waiter... he was the VERY FIRST person to say anything in the 14 months of breastfeeding in public, get over yourself, breasts are for breast feeding, if you are uncomfortable then don't watch pervert."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday dinner, easy seat at the bar Bar tender was nice and attentive Better menu than equivalent bars Good selection of draught beers. Hoegaarden White hit the spot.  -Young's BBQ burger: asked for pretzel bun instead of brioche - if you like a greasy burger w lots of cheese, you'll love this. Today, I reveled in the drippy thing w butter covered-bun -Side of vegetables: typical, handful of boiled (maybe steamed) frozen veggies, no flavoring of any sort - like an \"f you\" to us veggie eaters  -Warm cookie sundae: big warm chocolate chip cookie, covered in chocolate and caramel, w a giant scoop of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream: delicious"}
{"text":"Scottish ales and Boddington are strongly advised to beer drinkers."}
{"text":"Tough to rate since the service was great, but the food was average.  Received heavy pours, which is always great!   Only issue is burger was kinda dry.  I'll be back for the drinks, but will certainly try another food option."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place one star is because I wasn't sure if my review would be posted without at least one star. I was stuck in the Cleveland airport between flights and decided to eat lunch. I wandered into The Pub because it was the only sit down restaurant available. The decor was nice, typical English pub feel, but that was the extent of my positive experience. The place was fairly busy considering a lot of flights had been delayed due to the weather. My experience started off poorly simply because there was no one seating the customers and it was like a free for all to find a table. Compound that with strolling thru the entire floor to find an open table that wasn't full of dirty dishes when I found a table in the bar. Needless to say the table was dirty and hadn't been wiped clean. I cleaned it myself and sat down. It took one of the two working waitresses over 10 minutes to even acknowledge my presence. Once I was noticed, a polite, extremely overwhelmed waitress took my drink order. She returned 6 mins later with my beer in a newly washed glass, which means it was hot, not cold. I promptly waved her down to ask for a cold beer and she told me that she didn't have any chilled glasses available so I opted for a cold bottled beer. She grabbed my order and was quickly off. I found it strange that she seemed so hurried until I observed the entire restaurant and noticed that the restaurant only had two waitresses to work the entire floor. Now we're talking over 50 patrons in the restaurant looking as frustrated as I was about the service. I could go on for another four paragraphs about the atrocities being committed at this establishment but will summarize my experience in two words, bad management! If I was a shareholder in this chain I would immediately fire the manager of this location. I left feeling really bad for the two hustling waitresses and pissed off at the manager Gary Russo. Could have been a totally good experience considering the fact that my sheppard's pie was good. Totally sad."}
{"text":"This is a Bumblebee wwhich is supposed to be Guinness layered over Boddington's Pub Ale. As you can see in the picture there is no layers and on top of that, the beer was warm. At least not recommending the layered beer. It has a good ambient and the bartender changed it no charge. The spinach and artichoke dip was awesome! You can give it a try"}
{"text":"Decent place to park and eat drink while waiting for your flight. Food is Sysco quality and service is fine. Good selection of draught beers and a large bar with numerous TVs. Many seats had plugs for charging."}
{"text":"Irish pub in an airport that has Strongbow on tap, score! Unfortunately I was not feeling up to par so I just had a pepsi (no coke).   Started with the soup of the day, Italian Wedding, and it was surprisingly delicious. It was clearly freshly made and tasty. I had the pot roast with mashed potatoes and it was great. It came out already shredded with peas and carrots. The carrots were small, skinny sticks and they were crunchy, I would have preferred more cooked. The mashed potatoes were the shining moment, creamy and full of flavor.   The service was surprisingly good which overall made for a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I really like the decor and theme of the place.. but to be honest the food hasn't been great either time I've gone.  The first time I went I had the \"Toastie\" of the day.  It was Provolone Cheese and Pep.  Tasted ok, but nothing stellar.  The second trip I had Chicken Fingers (I know way to eat something \"British\") and those were just nasty to be honest.   The drinks are always good though.  I had a Blue Margarita type thing that is DELICIOUS-and packs a punch!"}
{"text":"I stopped here with my 3 kids during a 3-hour layover. I was really happy they had some healthy options. My cranberry almond salad was not impressive. It was over loaded & smothered with very sweet dressing. The chicken nuggets for my kids was so tough It was hard to cut with a knife and the didn't really get eaten. The fries & grilled cheese were the favorite items of our meals.   My Jack Daniels & 7-up was $10 and the WEAKEST drink in my life. When I brought it up to the server, she said that they pour exactly 1-ounce with the assistance of a machine or something. (I doubt it was even 1 ounce because all I could taste was the soda.) She said that all the drinks here are weak and are not a crowd-pleasers.  I had illusions of grandeur that I would spend my 3-hour layover relaxing here & enjoying cocktails, but not with the robot bartender. LOL  Our server Laurel was attentive, pleasant & friendly ... the redeeming factor of an underwhelming experience. Thanks Laurel!"}
{"text":"Decent sit down restaurant at CLE.  Part of a national chain of British Pub themed restaurants with a limited menu.  Service was slow, food was OK.  Arguably the best sit down restaurant at CLE."}
{"text":"The server acted liked it was too much to ask to have the dirty table and seats wiped.  No smile, no conversation.  We gather our things and left. Both staff members had no customer service skills. Definitely need to find different jobs. I have never walked out of a restaurant before by the way."}
{"text":"The service is fine when there are not many people but when there is a flight cancelled and people start to fill up the empty seats it takes way too long to get the bartender to acknowledge you. The beer is what you would expect to find in a British pub themed place but I was served a beer and there was absolutely nothing but foam (picture is posted). As for the food, I have only ever ordered the fried pickles and they were pretty tasty."}
{"text":"We went to see Jabbawookeez and wanted a quick dinner. My husband saw The Pub and we ducked in. It was great! Gretyl was our server. We sat at the bar and watched  the open kitchen, the food that came out looked amazing. Our burger was delicious, fries crispy and they knew we were splitting it so they cut the burger ahead and we didn't have to ask for extra plates. Our local beer was served in an ice cold frosty mug."}
{"text":"It is as good as it gets for breakfast in an airport that isn't fast food-court food.  They serve breakfast! Hot breakfast consisting of scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, bacon and sourdough toast. Quick and friendly service, it was nice to sit to have a traditional breakfast vs. sitting at the gate eating a Powerbar from the gift shop.  WiFi in the airport and the spacious dining area make it an easy comfortable place to eat and work. If you don't have work, you can sit next to the window and watch people go through security...that's always a fun activity :)  Limited breakfast menu, but it is good quality and at a decent airport price."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I had the chicken & waffles and enjoyed every bite! My husband had the roast beef sandwich and it was full of flavor. Hats off the the chefs!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money coming to this place. It's 8am and I'm sitting at the bar with the bartender having a pissy attitude b/c I'm just having water. It's the only location where I saw a plugin for my device.  The food on the other hand is very greasy.... Omelet and potatoes and a pound of grease. Keep calm and keep walking by the joint!"}
{"text":"Well, where do I start?  How about sitting at the bar because there was no hostess, then the server who walked over to greet me after 5 minutes only to announce she wanted a break and turned around and walked away. Finally, a moment later someone else walked up to take my order. I was served cold coffee and cold food that had something akin to a broken tooth in it (I'm gonna assume it was gristle ...). After giving me my check, my server walked past my outstretched credit card 3 times before taking it and run it through.  All of this while I was subjected to listening to their incessant complaining about their job, coworkers, and customers.  I'll be skipping it next time."}
{"text":"Oi, The Pub, a ubiquitous name for an establishment?   A convenient watering hole located in the main terminal of the Cleveland Hopkins Airport. Birds and Blokes wearing clothing similar to what was fashionable 40 years ago in London.   Not a bad place to go for a quick pint before a flight. The restaurant will get more and more authentic looking as it gets more worn in and gets the patina of boot marks worn into the bar stools and from peoples elbows resting on the wooden bar.   I've tried a few of the beers on draught here, I like the Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale.   Service- unassuming and competent.   Cheers Mate!"}
{"text":"Blend food, warm beer. It wasn't a good experience at all, but I wasn't expecting too much from an airport pub. The server was nice though, but they could make this a much better place specially by offering COLDER beer and BETTER food!"}
{"text":"Changing flights in Cleveland.  Looking for a healthy option - The deli is outta baked potato, the salad bar place just shut down for the night. (NICE.)  So I start wandering around and come across The Pub.  Since I am on Weight Watchers, I couldn't try the traditional british fare unfortunatley.  Went with the grilled salmon with the vegetable soup and a glass of syrah.  Asked for the bourre blanc with capers on the side.  The green beans and potato were cooked perfectly - very tasty.  The salmon was done a little more than I prefer, but not to the point of beng over cooked.  The vegetable soup qas quite good.  The wait staff was very attentive, and paid attention to the customers time constraints.    For an airport restaurant (even an airport version of a local) - better than average.  Certainly better the rest rest of the generic airport food to be found at CLE.  Definately worth the extra walk if you have the time.  Hopefully the diet won't keep me from trying the fish and chips next time thru CLE."}
{"text":"My experience at the Pub produced a grim milestone:  It was the first time, I've ever conscientiously sent something back to the kitchen - seriously the first time!  I ordered a Shepherd's pie - a dish I normally get very excited about.  What I got was one of the most grotesque and dreadful concoctions I've ever seen.  Think of a lame version of a cobb salad having a severe accident with a plate of cold mashed potatoes, drunkenly eloping and then foolishly giving birth to this absolutely hideous Shepherd's Pie.   This is what it basically was:  Ground beef with no flavor or marinade - just loose ground beef wading in lukewarm water, raw peas and carrots smattered on top and then cold mashed potatoes that did not appear to be roasted or even put into an oven - absolutely dreary and depressing - like a meal out of George Orwell's 1984.  I felt bad about sending it back - but I could hardly even look at it without getting nauseous.  Recognition has to be made to the bar-tender.  She was very sweet and replaced my order with fish and chips.  That was an redeeming factor."}
{"text":"We had lunch here yesterday to meet a friend who is now a local. We sat outside and enjoyed the day. The beer selection is always good. We tried the fried pickles and they were really good. Crispy and lots of dill punch and they serve it with 3 dipping sauces. The blue cheese fondue is surprising and delicious, I loved the BBQ and the ranch is really good too. We also shared the corn dogs and the truffled parmesan fries. We should have asked first because the corn dogs come on a bed of fries and they are really good small bites. I think my least favorite item was the truffled parmesan fries and they were really good too, just a little too much truffle for my taste. My favorite item here is the lobster rolls, everyone should try them at least once! This is one of our favorite pub's to visit while we are here.Thanks for always providing great service to go with the food and beers."}
{"text":"As it turns out, meal vouchers are good for booze - a little surprised by that.  As we were waiting for our flight, we decided to pop in to use our meal/booze vouchers.  We sat at the bar, right next to an outlet, very convenient for those of us who have phones that lose a charge with one click of an app.  Two Cranberry Vodka's for me and two JW's for the BF and we both entered our happy place before the flight.  Service was adequate and drinks were okay.  Good place to park it before a flight."}
{"text":"So many amazing and delicious restaurants in Vegas - but this is absolutely not one of them. Do NOT make the same mistake as us. Avoid at all costs. Just awful. They're not even trying or care.   1/2 hour wait for patio seating? Even though tables are empty and are not reserved. Fish and Chips, Burger, Fries, Wings, Breakfast - ALL terrible and cold too.   The place is nice and bright enough though with plenty of TVs to catch sporting events. Shame. In an emergency it may be alright to have an overpriced drink/beer only. But you will most definitely be disappointed and rank this as one of your worst dining experiences ever.   Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"The Good: its a very large full service pub, not just a small airport bar; very good beer selection including several authentic European brews. The Palm was very good. Service is above average, not like a typical airport bar. Good selection of good. I have been here several times.  The Bad: not really bad but good is average.  Tips: The main bar is huge and wraps around with lots of power outlets."}
{"text":"Only stopped here for a beer while waiting for a flight, but it was fine. Properly poured Guinness, service was fast and price was about what you'd expect.  Person next to me ordered food that didn't look that great, but can't comment since I didn't get anything myself. Looked fairly clean, would consider trying it again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"I'm sure this place would've been good, but waited 15 minutes for the old lady behind the bar. She looked at me multiple times, but was more concerned about washing dishes. Never got served. Had a flight to catch eventually. Went to Winners bar and grill instead and had amazing service as always!"}
{"text":"I have really fond memories of this place when it was Todd English P.U.B., and this was my first visit back since the change. The beer selection was fine, the bartender was friendly, and the food was... uninspiring. I get that it's not fine dining, but this was on the low end of what I'd consider pub fare.  However, I'm giving it an extra star because it provided me with some of the best entertainment of my trip. A guy a few seats down from me at the bar ordered a pastrami sandwich. He was really unhappy with the quality of the pastrami, and proceeded to have the absolute weirdest reaction I've ever seen. He proclaimed LOUDLY that he didn't want a discount and didn't want to make a big deal of it but that it was the WORST quality pastrami he ever experienced. He really didn't want a discount, a refund, or a replacement - apparently he just wanted to lecture every single staff member about the evils of low-quality pastrami and the perils of buying your meat from the lowest-cost bidder. For a good 45 minutes. Maybe he was a meat salesman? The extra star is for the staff, who were unfailingly polite to this weirdo.   Edit to add that the lady who sat down after meat critic left also ordered the pastrami and seemed to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Have you noticed that airport restaurants are in general, well, terrible? This one is no exception.  The service was so terrible at the bar, I was ready to leave. I could literally not get the attention of the bartender through normal means of communication. If you want service here, you better have a strategy to get their attention such as wearing a highlighter color hat or bringing an amplifier to shout at them."}
{"text":"Godawful.  Unless you like your food cold (twice) and the kitchen staff to huddle and point at you whenever a complaint is lodged.  And another memo to the kitchen: a hotdog is not a sausage, despite similar appearance. I didn't think it was possible to mess up \"sausage and mash\" but congratulations - you did.  Hopefully this restaurant will close before it's even a year old."}
{"text":"The Pub is located post-security inside of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. I stopped in here one morning for a quick breakfast before boarding a flight back to Dulles.  I ordered an omelette with spinach, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers, cheddar cheese, and sausage, plus a cup of coffee.  The omelette came out in about 10 minutes. It was decent enough. I prefer omelettes where the ingredients are folded into the egg - vs. sautéing some ingredients and then wrapping the egg around it. The Pub does it the latter. Of course I added some black pepper to the omelette to give it some flavor.  While I waited, I noticed the place needs a serious cleaning. The covers of the menus were spotted with dried residue of who knows what; the back of the beer taps frame had dried something all over it (looked like dried ketchup). The lighting in the place is very dim, so I am guessing part of it may be - they can't see how dirty the place is. There were also these tiny little flies hanging out in the beer taps area."}
{"text":"Friendly people. Food smells good. That was our first impression. Bartender was great at suggesting a beer that was close to my hubby's fav, and it was. They have Young's Double Chocolate Stout on draft, yum!  Our first bartender was going off shift so we closed our tab and opened another with the new bartender. Good thing, because the new one did not deserve a tip! Had to flag her down for refills, to place a food order and to pay the tab. We could have easily walked out on our tab but didn't. I recommend and will go back, just hope I get the bartender we had first next time. :)"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and it was a very sad experience. We sat at the bar and our waitress was super sweet and tried to accommodate our order the best that she could since the menu is has a very limited selection. I asked for egg whites instead of regular eggs, no butter on my toast and eggs. As she went back to the kitchen to explain the order to the chef he yelled at her for all the accommodations and so when she came back to us to explain that we could no longer as for anything else to be changed because the chef was mad it put us in a very very uncomfortable situation to where we were hesitate to ask for anything else such as condiments, hot sauce, or anything else. This was the worst experience ever and we will never go back. It wasn't worth the money or stress that it put on us. We where there to enjoy ourselves and that did not happen. We felt like we had to sit there with our hands crossed and not say a word because we were going to get scolded by the chef again. Never going back."}
{"text":"I came here before a flight with vouchers in hand from a cancelled flight, and the waitress did not enter $50 worth. Instead, she dropped off a bill and later claimed they didn't go through without informing me of that. I place more blame on the manager, a shady bald man, who could not remedy the situation and instead told me I was on my own and that he \"needed payment.\" My boyfriend had to walk all the way to United to get new ones. The agent there said the restaurant had entered them incorrectly. Our new vouchers worked - very suspicious. And the customer service on the managers part was atrocious. I was basically held hostage when he could have just worked it out on his own. Don't eat here!"}
{"text":"This place has a good atmosphere, was here drinking a beer while waiting for my flight. Food is not that expensive compared to other airport food."}
{"text":"Very happy with the food (Impossible Burger- who knew it was vegan?) and the service. Our waitress was terrific and very attentive, and the table was cleared and refills offered exactly as needed. Lily was awesome, as was her helper."}
{"text":"I stopped here for happy hour with a co-worker after a long day at an event. It was a nice place to sit outside and grab a drink and a snack. We ordered the happy hour special rose along with the fried pickles. The staff was friendly and the beer list was extensive. There wasn't a ton of seating outside it's a little crammed and you're kind of tucked away so there is no view or action but it's a good place to check out."}
{"text":"Just wanted to grab a quick breakfast before my flight to North Carolina. My dad, who is a seasoned eat-and-fly type of person suggested The Pub. The breakfast menu is small but the last item, Corned Beef Hash and Eggs, caught my eye. I ordered quick because breakfast was ending soon, and I swear five minutes later my food arrived. The time interval made me suspicious... The toast and eggs could be made that quick, but the corned beef hash must have been sitting and waiting to be served up, yuck.   Food arrived lukewarm. The hash was actually pretty mushy, mushier than others I have had. Eggs were cooked well for over easy, but the toast was barely toasted. It could barely melt the butter I had spread onto it. Also, in my little plate of butter and jams, the strawberry jam was already opened and used... Uhhhh EW! Did they not even switch the plate between customers?   I mean, overall better than I would expect for airport food. But airport food in general has icky tendencies... The server was a nice lady at least. Which is surprising because they all were wearing a uniform of a pleated plaid skirt, which can't be fun in this Cleveland winter weather!"}
{"text":"Service was efficient and quick.  Fish and chips.   Fish way-way overcooked.  Fries were ok but some crispy and some soggy and overcooked.  One piece of fish for $20 is just sorry even for Vegas.  Great beer selection."}
{"text":"Recently closed permanently.  http://experiencethepub.com/rocky-river/news#/08/07/2011/pub-rocky-river-statement"}
{"text":"The service was average.  I sat down before another couple and they were served first.  I said ok and ordered anyway.    I ordered the fish and chips meal.  The fries were barely warm and the fish was over cooked.  The fish was so hard I tried to cut it and it popped across the table.  I brought this to the waitress attention and showed it to her.  She said our fish is \"extra crispy\".  I said ok and asked for the check.  The cost for this meal (one piece of fish, fries and a soda) was $21.  My first and last trip to this place.    Sad... This is a new territory for me and many more trips planned."}
{"text":"This review was pretty difficult to write. The experience, overall, was well, very average. I never visited a British pub before so I didn't know what to expect...  I had the chocolate stout burger, cooked as I desired but it just seemed ok with its tastes. The fries are very large and thick.   They have a pretty good beer selection from England and Ireland [over a dozen] and have the prices and good descriptions of the beers in the beer menus, cool.   The service was very good: my grandpa doesn't go out of his comfort zone often [and yes, the pub was out of it] and the server was very accommodating to him, his picky eating habits, and that we changed tables when we first sat down because he wanted a table with chairs that have backs on them [only a few  tables here actually do].   A decent experience but the food didn't make me want to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Best airport bar- ever!  And I've been to plenty of airports.  Huge English draft selection.  Had the Bangers and mash and you would never know you are in an airport by the quality and look of the food.  Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Ehhh. Saw it straight from security. Wish I decided to take a look at the food court... there's a chik Fila there. Which would have undoubtedly been better."}
{"text":"They have a huge selection of beers. We got the big pretzel and it was ginormous and really yummy. The shrimp cocktail was really good...good size shrimp and the cocktail sauce had the perfect amount of horseradish. We also had the chicken wings...perfect amount of heat. Our server, Joany was awesome...super nice and friendly. We might go back tomorrow for the fish and chips, which I heard is really good"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place when we were trying to figure out what to eat. We were seated right away and brought our menus. A few minutes later, someone came by and gave us the happy hour menu. The waitress came by and asked what we wanted to drink and brought us waters. She took our order and that was that. She would check on us occasionally, but I swear she never smiled. She almost seemed irritated to be working. The food was great, the restaurant itself had a very chill and relaxing atmosphere. The only reason I have to give 3 stars is because I wasn't too impressed with the waitress. I wish she would've smiled or pretended to like her job. I don't know if I'd go back or not."}
{"text":"Good ambience only small beer size. Not enough stock of ipa beer. The foods are all salty."}
{"text":"We won't go again. I ordered the Caesar with grilled chicken. The chicken was dry and a weird pink color. He got the Reuben... skinniest Reuben I've seen. We both ordered mimosas -airport price at $12/drink.    It was the worst Reuben he'd ever had and the worst chicken Caesar salad I've had. Just bad all around. The service was fast, but almost TOO fast. He barely let me order the chicken portion of my salad-which I was in the process of doing- before he rushed in and asked if I wanted some chicken, salmon or steak on it. Just a bit rude the whole time. Bad food. Should've gotten some fast food."}
{"text":"I am at a airport so yes , my expectations are low to start off with ! This place was pretty decent for any airport let alone the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport ouch .. Great selection of draft beers , they had the usual English Bitter Ales paired with decent English Pub Food Fare .I tried the fried calamari which came with a curry sauce and a sweet spicy sauce , paired it with a couple of English Ales . I ordered a side of tartar sauce and I must that was the best dipping sauce for the fried calamari . Anyways , it was good and filling , ended my 'healthy meal' with  a caramel apple tart ( that was the bartender's suggestion , kudos to her !) which just hit the spot and I ended up passing out on my flight like a 4 month old !!"}
{"text":"I spent an alright hour or so here this past Sunday...I had a flight to PHL that was delayed and was looking for something other than the food court. I never manage to be in Hopkins late enough in the day to get a beer...I am always flying out early in the morning.  However this day I was able to....and was a bit let down. The bar wench (and I do say this with respect...not in a derogatory manner) was quite pleasant and attentive. And she really seemed apologetic that most of her taps were out of order...basically there was a choice of only 4 ales to choose from even though there were quite more on the draught list. She also had to regretfully inform me that many of the food items such as Shepherd's Pie were out for the day (mind you it is only 4PM).  I did like the ambiance and the feel to the place. I have been to a few pubs in London and elsewhere in Great Britain and while obviously it is not the same, the decor and the sociable atmosphere are similar.  I give this three stars because of the broken taps....lack of food...but wait staff was pretty great. Kudos to them."}
{"text":"For an airport bar, not too shabby!  This is a chain restaurant that I have dined at in a few different cities.  I was expecting to be underwhelmed by the airport location, but was pleasantly surprised.  Other than the fact that you can look out the door and see airport, you would never know that this location was in an airport based on the decor.  The Pub has a large beer selection as well as wines and liquors.  They also make specialty beer drinks like black and tans, snakebites, etc.  The drinks are a bit pricey, but it's the airport so that is expected.  As for the food, we split a goat cheese flat bread, wings, spinach dip, and beer cheese.  All of the appetizers came out hot and fresh and tasted darn good.  The Pub is a nice spot to chill in the Cleveland airport!"}
{"text":"Terrible service the waitress messed up and one of the sandwiches was cold there were no napkins or silverware on the table and the fries were fried to hell and nasty and we weren't waited on for about 15 minutes and she never came back after we got our food"}
{"text":"Walked 20 minutes to get here based on a review I read about their Bloody Mary... they are under new ownership and have a very average Bloody Mary.  We arrived at 10am which is opening time and watched the staff sit around for an additional 15 minutes before unlocking the front door upon which the manager welcomed us with \"You can come in now\" - no apology to the group of people that were waiting outside.  Food was ok with the exception of the eggs Benedict - egg came out hard boiled vs. poached. Since it took 45 minutes to hit the table we excepted more.... won't be back."}
{"text":"Thinking of breakfast?  Don't. Terrible.  Cold toast, re heated bacon, cold potatoes and eggs. How hard can it be? Should perhaps only stop here if you were looking for a drink, not food."}
{"text":"We are so disappointed as this was of our favorite restaurant at the Aria.  It is a new restaurant and owner...not Todd English anymore.  Had the clam chowder and calamari. Both terrible. The clam chowder had huge chunks of bacon. The calamari was very greasy and served all clumped. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Drink; don't eat! Black bean burger (inedible) and French fries (coated with misc \"other\" fried pieces of things with them: gross and gross!).  Good beer and good service earn the Pub two stars instead of one."}
{"text":"The curry fries were intriguing--regular fries with yellow and red curry dipping sauce.  I prefered the yellow.  (The red only held my interest for a minute.)   We shared them.  They were very good for the first half, but we were over them by the second half; I was back to vinegar and ketchup.  BF reports that his double stout BBQ hamburger was very good.  The fried pickle was excellent.  The goat cheese was exactly as expected.  The beer selection was intriguing but (understandably) quite English in palette.  They offer a sampler, which I always love!  The dark beers were the standard Guinness-Smithwicks-Newcastle, but that might get more interesting in the winter time.  Not especially vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"Ventured over to the West Side today and stopped in here for lunch. I wasnt hungry enough for the fish & chips, so I went for the battered fish sandwich. Not bad! Also the filet was enormous, and I had to take half the sandwich home. Bonus points for the fried pickles, which I don't see much around this area. Add on a snakebite, and I was a happy girl. My husband's grilled chicken sandwich was also tasty. All in all, a solid choice for lunch I would say."}
{"text":"So lets get the scenario straight,  you're at an airport  in Cleveland.  If you are like me then you just came from terminal A where the Sam Adams bar informed you that they only serve hot dogs and do not have Sam Adams.   So I was sent to The Pub.    There are a lot of positive reviews here and, lets face it, it seems like you are stuck here with no choices.  So I will review this as an airport restaurant, not as a place that I would plan a night out to.  It was a pretty standard Americanized British pub menu with an Americanized pub look (English, Scottish?  Yorkshire maybe?).  Nothing special about the food and while the woman who served me was nice the bartender was a bit brusque.  They were dressed authentically like the bartenders in the guild of students back at college in the late 80s -- I don't imagine that many travelers are nostalgic for that though.  Down with Thatcher!  Free Mandella!  Stuff the Poll Tax!  There were some interesting import beers on the menu, I'll give them credit for that.  My preference for an airport restaurant (behind the TSA section) is that it not close me off totally from the airport -- I don't want to forget what I am there for.  Also, if you have lots of TVs and if you are trying to serve your clients (remember this not a real-world pub, but an airport pub), then allow for the closed captioning to be turned on -- it is noisy and your clients (probably business travelers and not families who would find the place pricey) want to know about the news or the weather; things that affect their travel.  You are an airport pub, not a sports bar.   Two stars because I travel a lot and I have experienced better.  $20 for an appetizer (artichoke dip, largely melted cheese) and a pint."}
{"text":"Stopped for snacks   Hit the spot. Friendly service  Good sour cream onion dip Good fried pickles I was too slow to get fried cheese  so that had to be good also.   Staff was friendly and kind.  Brought my daughter crackers early as she felt week due to lack of food (when and why we came in)"}
{"text":"Nice food, good atmosphere and staff at nicer than the other restaurant.  Very pleasant dinning experience."}
{"text":"After airport security. No map showing choices, and nothing near our gate so we sat down here. Totally ignored so we changed seats to get ignored in a new area. Severely understaffed. Staffs' solution was to ignore a (large) percentage of the people until they left. We were hungry and had time so we stuck it out and eventually a waitress graced us with her presence. Food was good and good beer choices, but the service soured the taste of everything."}
{"text":"It's an airport pub, so the burgers and beer are good. Oh and the chips are crispy and hot. The wine selection sucks (I should have known better....it's a pub) so drink beer. The bartender was attentive and friendly. Low light and relaxed atmosphere so easy to relax when waiting for United to not suck."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find this oasis in the middle of the airport while the BF and I were waiting for our flight home! I don't do fast food if it's at all possible, so we decided to check this place out. Last day of our mini vacay so why not get a beer? we are in the PUB!! They had a pretty good beer list and I saw Palm on draft! WHAA?? Our waitress was also super sweet and knowledgeable. But ;( BUMMER!! the keg was dry!!! I ended up with a Stella I think and a really tasty chicken salad with cranberries and almonds and mandarin oranges. I was trying!! My BF tried the shepherd's pie and really liked it. The atmosphere was also really cozy and cute and there was a good size bar where you could watch sports or news du jour if you like! I would recommend this as a change from the average fast food airport fare. We were glad we did!"}
{"text":"The Cleveland airport is bleak and there are not a lot of options that let you experience a little bit of Cleveland once more.  I visited the Pub and the service was awesome.  I took the server's recommendation of the pretzel roll with sweet onions, ham, and Swiss - it looked half of pound of ham was slapped on the roll - it was a bit much for me but still tasty - the roll was fresh and the onions caramelized well.  I read about the fried pickle but it blended with the fries and I had a bit of a wow moment as I took  a bite unexpectedly.  Fries were good steak fries.  Great selection of beers - a bit pricey though."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to stop in for a drink and/or appetizer before a flight or during a layover. Their beer selection is fairly good and their food isn't bad either. We ordered the Mushroom Flatbread before and it was pretty good. We just wished they used fresh mushrooms and not canned mushrooms."}
{"text":"I ate here because my flight was delayed. Because you can seat yourself, you don't have to wait very long until you can order. The restaurant was super busy, but the server was still attentive. I ordered the artichoke dip, which was unfortunately too cheesy for my tastes."}
{"text":"I actually like this place.  Yup, an airport pub.  I'll own it. Understand, this would be a three-star place if I was grading it against real-world (non-airport) establishments.  The servers are always cheerful.  The background music is good (Neon Trees, etc.). The dim lighting and the wooden paneling almost make you forget you are in Cleveland.  Or the airport for that matter(when you have no choice but to be there).    There is a nice selection of import beers and the fish that comes with the fish and chips is remarkably battered to perfection.  The chips leave a little to be desired."}
{"text":"For airport food this was pretty good.  Got a burger with bacon an fries.  Service was fast and friendly.  They have good beers on tap as well.  Looks and feels like an old English pub minus the flat screens of course."}
{"text":"it was the worst meal i've ever had in Vegas.  i ordered the fish and chips. the fish was greasy and undercooked and the fires were also greasy and undercooked. don't waste your time and money going here. much better places in Vegas. McDonalds is across the street and has better fish and french fries."}
{"text":"Everything was just ok. The service was better than the food/prices. The food was decent, but not for the price. I ordered the bangers and mash - the flavors were good, but very basic. My husband got the prime rib sandwich. The horseradish cream was  very overpowering and made the sandwich kind of hard to eat. Overall, this was just a \"meh\" visit. Everything was ok, but nothing wowed us."}
{"text":"I have to agree with everyone else, the revamped of this place is a flop. The fried pickles were made with what tasted like bread and butter pickles which made for a disgusting sweetness to the app. The Reuben was filled with 90% meat, less than 2 tbsp of sauerkraut, overall it was very unappetizing. I used to look forward to Todd English PUB for every trip to Vegas, now I wouldn't bother coming back here again. Boo!"}
{"text":"So I am on my way out of CLE (Cleveland Airport) and as usual arrive early for my flight. Decided to get a sit down breakfast and not the usual fast food breakfast. That was the the first mistake, and the second mistake was walking into this place. CLE has very limited sit down places to eat for Breakfast and I assumed (we all know what that means) this would be a good choice. Mistake three (in most sports three strikes your out) and I should have been out of this place as soon as sat down.   Clues your not in a good place:  1) Very few people in the the place and the airport is packed with many people walking in then turning around and walking out.  2) Dirty tables from those that did stay, but plenty of food still on the plate.  3) The one server running around yelling and complaining about being alone in the floor. As well as being unacceptably rude to the customers coming in and going out. Just because your in the weeds is no reason to express it or show it in any way to the customers.  4) Multiple people waiting to pay their bill and get the heck out, and others trying to order.   So I guess I just wanted to eat and ignored my gut and other spider senses telling me to turn around and run. When I final got the server to stop for a second so I could order she did not stand at the table but rather the POS station and barked out what do you want. I orders 3 eggs sunny, crispy bacon, toasted English Muffin, coffee, OJ, water. What I got was:  Cold coffee No OJ And when the food came after 15-min it was cold eggs and potatoes, un-toasted muffin and still refrigerator cold, barely cooked bacon. Even the guest across from me said \"cold food?\" As he could tell I was not happy and he had not even ordered yet and he had been there shortly after I did. So no server to get my breakfast fixed I \"Walked up to the bar\" and asked to have this meal refired so I could eat. The guy behind the bar took it back and the server just looked at me like I had just sprouted a second and third head and breathed fire. So asking to refire you would assume (there I go again with the assume) they would get it right. Well I am here to tell you brother and sisters \"Not even close\". The eggs were wrong in cooking and number. The bacon was now over cooked, the muffin was just slightly tan, so by now I was done (again should have been done long before that). By the way the refire took less than 3min (hum, me thinks this a bit shady). So I offered to pay for the cold coffee but they said there was no charge (how kind of them).   So to wrap up this novel:  I do not recommend this place unless your going to drink your meal as an adult beverage."}
{"text":"Let's face it, airport food generally sucks but this place was a pleasant surprise. Decent beer selection on tap, some imported beers available too and fast service. Haven't tasted the food myself but my colleagues ordered the buffalo chicken wings and loved them. Perfect place to kill some time before boarding."}
{"text":"A very decent choice for lunch or dinner, especially given the limited choices in many airports.  I was pleasantly surprised by this Brit-styled pub.  The interior is snug, dark-wood toned, and additionally had a droll \"outdoor\" patio section as an alternate seating area.  The menu certainly had many familiar American faves like burgers and reubens, but they highlighted some classic (maybe cliched?) British pub fare like bangers & mash, fish & chips, scotch eggs, shepherd pie.  I had a nice ham and melted swiss on a pretzel bun with Guiness-braised onions.  It was rich, tasty, and satisfying; the pretzel bun had a nice al dente chewiness to it; and it came with a mustard sauce on the side that had a good bite and sharpness.    The Pub also offered a decent selection of UK stouts, lagers, and ales as well as domestic ones; and a selection of well-known scotches.  If I ever get delayed in CLE, I'll at least know a place to settle into and plow through the single malts!"}
{"text":"As far as airport choices for food and a beer this is solid. I had the fish and chips and the hubby had the shepherds pie. My piece of haddock was gigantic and I couldn't finish more than half. The pie was on the small side. Service was fast and efficient. They have a pretty large bar area and a couple booths if you need to hang for a while. I'd come back."}
{"text":"This is by far the \"Worst Oysters\" I've ever had :/ tasteless & watery not with natural juice per se :/ like some one took the oyster liquor off and pored salty water in the shells and small oysters (6) for 20$  Horrible food horrible  drink  Just disgusting for a supposed 5 star hotel   Omg  - I feel so f@ucking ripped and cheated ! I hate this damn place !  Def not a Todd English restaurant any longer -  caveat emptor !  I WANT MY MONEY BACK - close ur doors , ur so bad ur great !!!  And damn well rude ass staff as well - they can all s@uck it ..."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast this morning and was disappointed. My omelette was way over cooked and the egg was crispy. My husband got the chicken and waffles which was also really over cooked. The chicken was rock hard and dry. The only reason it gets two stars is because our waitress was friendly and super attentive. Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"I had the Fish and chips... the Fish and batter are excellent... The fries were some of the worst I've ever had in my life. They are I believe reconstituted fries from powdered potatoes... The kind that you find at a very cheap burger place.. Rachel brought me a salad to replace them. Salad was a nice mix of greens, with a decent house dressing. Service was great, overpriced fish and chips was way better than overpriced McDonald's or the other crappy food at the airport."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Came here for breakfast. Foods not that great and it seemed kind of dirty. I got the egg platter. Coffee sucked. My husband liked his omelette though."}
{"text":"Had The Pub for lunch today. It was good but nothing super special about it. Started with the hush puppies and had the fried chicken sandwich. The waiter warned me that it was spicy so I got the sauce on the side and am glad I did. My friend had the fish & chips and I think the fish must have come from Free Willy cause it was huge.   They have a nice outside seating area and since the weather was beautiful we sat outside and people watched. From that we confirmed that many people don't look in a mirror before going out in public.   Overall a fine lunch but nothing I couldn't get at home or Applebee's"}
{"text":"I don't believe this place will survive. I liked it so much better when it was the Todd English Pub. Food is just OK and nothing to brag about. Don't think I will be going back. It's a real shame."}
{"text":"No longer Todd English.  Most of their menu is gone.   No raw bar.  No pot pie.  Prices are expensive.   $20 Ruben was OK.  Service was great but I want more options!  Food was slow to come out when empty.  I was a fan.  Good bye!"}
{"text":"Came here to wait for a flight. The atmosphere was nice and the food was tasty. I got the fish sandwich and my mother got the chicken sandwich. Both were cooked well and my portion was huge.   Didn't drink so I can't speak to that, but it's a relaxed place to hang between flights"}
{"text":"I honestly want to give this place 0 stars. The Bloody Mary was awful and nothing like what they have on their yelp page. And the Stella was ridiculously flat. I would not recommend this place unless you literally want to walk away with a bad taste in your mouth"}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight. Nothing special. Food was good but not great.  Half order of appetizers for $3.95 on Thursday (might have been happy hour special.)  Service was good as was the ambience but not a place i will plan to often revisit."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a quick bite before a flight. The bartender was very friendly and showed me where I could charge my phone under the bar.  I ordered the black bean burger with fries (actually know as chips since it's an Irish place) and surprisingly,  it was one of the best black bean burgers I've ever had.   Enjoyed a tasty bloody mary, too!!"}
{"text":"So if you're stuck in an airport, in Cleveland no less, this will be your saving grace. First class English pub in the oddest of locations. A spot like this deserves to be in the middle of a busy urban street. The beer selection is amazing for an airport and the food is well above typical air travel standards."}
{"text":"Stuck in Cleveland?  Head to the Pub.  The Pub is tucked away near security and, while you're there, you forget you are in an airport and hoping that your flight is not delayed.  Many airport places skimp on the size of the bar, so I was so glad to be able to grab a seat at the bar and not feel cramped.  Lots of TVs around the bar, but, unfortunately, I was stuck watching Fox News at mine.  (Sports, people. Think sports.  Or, when it's snowing out, maybe the Weather Channel.  We want to know the likelihood that we will get out of dodge.)  The food was great, and the beer selection was even better.  Smithwick's on tap in an airport?  Yes please!  The burger was a good size and very flavorful.  All in all, a great experience.  However, as others have noted, the servers wear kilts.  My eyes, my eyes!  Please, The Pub, no more kilts."}
