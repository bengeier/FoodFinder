{"text":"Very nice people and great service. The green juice is worth every penny. The vegan GF pizza is delicious. Their muffins are amazing. Everything I have tried is very well done."}
{"text":"Didn't used to be a fan but management has changed and I love this place now. As has been previously mentioned the staff are really friendly and the price is reasonable for vegetarian food  in Montreal. My favorites include the stew and glass noodle salad and the desserts and smoothies are good too! Definitely worth a trip when you feel like something healthy!"}
{"text":"Blech
But for the amazing kindness of the staff my experience would have been a total loss.  Very dated not well prepared not even  properly heated vintage 1998 vegetarian fare. Wish I could have liked it but I couldn't even eat it. Cold, twice reheated stuffed bell peppers with flavourless brown rice and red beans, tough chewy (again flavourless) Brussels sprouts, half decent kale salad (surprisingly bright dressing-the only highlight of the experience). Yuck.  This is my second visit after a terrible first. My bad for returning-shame on me."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this for anyone that is vegan. The owner will often say things are vegan when they are not. Salads are often 1-3 days old. Not recommended for diabetics too. The food is marketed as \"gourmet vegetarian\" but is often very sugary and oily. Every time I have been here the owner was yelling at employees obscenely. A very unpleasant environment. The food is also very overpriced."}
{"text":"Over priced food. I went in there and the girl behind the counter told me the quiche was 6$ and then she charged me 7$ for it-oops she made a mistake!So I ask for quiche and the girl picks the sandwich-spacey hippie!
Then I asked her to heat up the quiche for me and she didn't do such a great job.
I don't feel I got such a great value for 7$-a small piece of quiche.
Do they really have to put cane sugar in all their cakes???I intolerant to cane sugar-they could use maple syrup for gods sake."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, and great if you want to still eat something healthy but are too lazy to make it yourself. Wish they had longer hours of op though....but that's life!!! 
Good for pick up to bring home or you can eat it there they'll warm it up for you, usually takes a bit of a while but nonetheless, very worth it."}
{"text":"Just got my first taste of Juicy Lotus' fare tonight. We took out for dinner, since we were both busy with school and work. 

We got a pad thai with tofu shrimp and green vegetable stir-fry and it was delicious! yum!

I can't wait to try more of their foods!

this is a great and healthier alternative on a night that you are too busy to cook, but don't want to order something greasy."}
{"text":"After hot yoga trip with the girlfriend, we made our way to Juicy Lotus for a quick vegetarian supper as we were both too lazy too cook. It's a small and charming eatery on Monkland street next to many shops and cafes.

The restaurant has very generous portion sizes. For $11, you can get a 24 oz box and fill in as many different veggies as you want. I tend to choose a bit of everything, just to sample it all. My favorite would be the eggplants, I always take about half along with other salads. It's very rich and packed with flavour. 

The stuffed vine leaf salad wasn't that great. It was a bit too sour with a funny aftertaste. It wasn't awful, but I wouldn't order that again. 

I wouldn't mind returning if I am in the area after another hot yoga session and I wanted a quick bite."}
{"text":"So, the food is fantabulous. Really, it's delicious, but WHYYYYYY is it so expensive!? I would eat there once a week or at least a few times a month if I didn't feel like my wallet was just emptied (I had another word in mind but it didn't seem politically correct and slightly offensive). Also, to be honest, the staff is hit of miss. Sometimes the staff is friendly and helpful and other times you feel like your interrupting someone's life... So, be warned, it's so tasty, pricey and the service is a 50/50 chance."}
{"text":"I love this place. Vegan/vegetarian food geared to takeout. Sometimes when I want to take a break from cooking, I stock up on this delicious, healthy and colourful prepared food. I buy enough to last us three days. I love the lentil loaf, stuffed peppers, pierogis and samosas. Also, there's always a few different salads to try. I find it pretty expensive but worth it when you want to take a break from cooking. It's better than having to order pizza."}
{"text":"This cafe style eatery was incredibly well priced for the portions. I feel that if I lived in this neighbourhood I would be on first name basis with the staff within the week. This spot reminded me a lot of cafe bliss in Victoria BC, where it feels more like you're over at a friends kitchen than a restaurant, a charm I love when it comes to local businesses. If you're looking for some unique eats to try, head down to this gem... Also, the rest if the neighbourhood is surrounded by beautiful shops and cafés to check out while you're done your feast."}
{"text":"Smack in the heart of Monkland Village, Juicy Lotus is a small café that offers wonderful vegetarian and vegan dishes that taste like they are truly homemade. We'd accidentally stumbled on it when we found out Cafe Harvard, down the street, was closed for a photo shoot.

The menu here, the waitress warns, changes frequently, so don't expect the same thing to be here the next week! The open fridge on the side offers a variety of drinks, soups and cold dishes which are premade. As well, there are approximately half a dozen different cold salads, including one with button mushrooms and another with red quinoa. You can purchased the salads according to how many ounces you want. Pizzas and sandwiches are available as well and can be heated up in an oven.

For a lunch entree, I bought a box of poivrons farcis ($6.99) - two ginormous red peppers stuffed with mock chicken, zucchini, quinoa and herbs, dressed in a tangy tomato sauce. Even though it was cold, the peppers were delicious and hearty. I had a difficult time trying to finish them! My boyfriend had a bean and rice burrito, a dash of red hummus and a cauliflower and celery soup. Everything, including a hot tea, came out to $22 including tax.

There's not much room here; seating is limited to a handful of small tables, but the option for take-out is available too. The waitress that we met here was extremely friendly; she brought the food out for us and took her time to make us feel welcome. 

A place that proves that not all the good stuff is downtown!

NOTE: Want to bring the cooking home? Take a class here - available Tuesday and Thursday nights. $50 per class or $300 for 10 classes. Variety of topics including macrobiotic, raw and ethnic cuisines."}
{"text":"I'm always skeptical about vegan or vegetarian food , not because I don't like fruits and veggies but just because it's tough to get that wow factor. BUT I tried juicy lotus and I have to say I was impressed ! I've tried their smoothies , and they're fresh and flavourful and definitely give you that boost of vitamins :) two of my favourite items are their samosas and their roasted eggplant salad , both packed with flavour and fresh ingredients. The staff is always friendly and while I wouldn't call this a sit down place , it is very clean inside and there is some seating , although most people seem to take their food to go. They have a variety of salads and desserts as well as pre packaged items you can pick up. They are a tad pricey depending on what you buy but to be fair the ingredients are fresh and the food is tasty and they let you sample the salads before buying so you can see if you like it , which I think is nice."}
{"text":"i come here onc3 in a while but not too often the food is but a bit to greasy I find."}
{"text":"A couple days ago, I did a great afternoon Yoga class at Moksha Yoga NDG. I was meeting a friend who said he was at a vegetarian cafe, and this was part of my journey to Cafe Juicy Lotus. This seemed be a great idea, healthy food after a good bit of exercise. As I went in, I really liked the vibe. Small, cozy, and smelling great. I had a veggie burger with avocado salad & a stuffed vine leaf salad. The veggie burger was good, and the salads were fantastic. While I ate my friend had a biscotti, which was not too bad, this made me want to get something to eat so I opted for an energy ball made of coconut & some sort of green tea. It was delicious. In the end I am super happy that my friend introduced me to this cafe. I will definitely go back and give a try...after a nice sweaty yoga session that is."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service, and nice ambience. Small space so a group of more than four or five would be a challenge but there are two small (2-seater) tables, and one larger 5-seater table. You go up to the counter, and order whatever it is you want. If it's a soup, you'll sometimes need to fetch the container from the fridge across the counter, and hand it to the counter person. Otherwise, they have nearly everything right there on the other side of the glass. Either way, figure out what you'd like. 

Everything except the quiche was vegan on the day that I went. Score. I got this creamy chickpea salad, a veggie chicken asian salad, and two samosas. My friends got the stuffed pepper, a couple of samosas, a carrot salad, and spiced aubergines. They decided to share the stuffed pepper, because the thing was HUGE and positively overflowing with the lentils-and-rice stuffing. The portions that the lady had dished out for theirs was enormous. She also provided a variety of little dipping sauces for the samosas. Mine was a very tahini-filled hummus, and theirs was a red pepper one. Both were lovely. 

The portions were generous. Once I got finished eating my meal, I was pleasantly full, and had to more or less roll myself out the door. Ah well. Maybe dessert next time!? The food was packed with flavour. The Asian veggie chicken thing was loaded with fresh ginger, a little sourness from what tasted like rice vinegar, and plenty of fresh marinated vegetables. The samosas had a spicy filling with a nice kick. The chickpea salad was creamy and delicious. It was all full of flavour. 

The lady behind the counter was an absolute sweetheart. She had lots of patience while we tried to figure out what we wanted, while still getting the food to us in a timely fashion, even though she was all by herself in the kitchen! The best part is that coming here is an adventure, because the menu changes from day to day, based on what the cook feels like making. That way, you don't get bored of the same thing over and over again. 

I've been to a lot of restaurants, and worked at one (doing all the different jobs) for years. I know how difficult it is to make a concept like Juicy Lotus work, and I'm pleased that there is such a place that you don't have to go downtown to get to."}
