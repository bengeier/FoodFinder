{"text":"I ran down to Paoli Local Foods a week before Thanksgiving to pick up a fresh heritage turkey.

It was one of the best turkeys we've ever had. Great taste, great texture (never frozen), and nice & juicy. No crazy brining or basting necessary."}
{"text":"OK, update on this place.  They have a shelf of items past their expiration date, for sale at a discount.  Super cool idea, right?  I hate food waste as much as the next guy, and am not overly concerned about \"best by\" dates, so I deliberately picked up some veggie stock that was a few months past expiration date.  And felt good about it.

When I got home and started using the items though, I noticed that *all* of the items I purchased were past their expiration dates.  Not just the stock.  Literally, every single product.  Not a huge deal to me if things like dried pasta or canned tomato paste are a few weeks or months past their prime.  But some of the items were *years* past.  One date stamped on a product was early 2013.  It is now 2016.  Normally I'm good about spot-checking dates, but I didn't at this store because I'd assumed everything past would be on the (designated) \"past\" shelf.  

I should note the prices here are higher than basically any other grocery store I've ever been to.  Initially, I didn't necessarily mind since I realized it was an out-of-the way place with limited inventory.  But, come on!  Don't charge me 3x what a normal store would charge for an expired product!  Poor form.  Check the labels."}
{"text":"Paoli Foods has an attached Paoli Cafe, not to be confused with the excellent Paoli Schoolhouse Cafe or Paoli Brat Haus. Paoli Foods, as a name, seems like something of a euphemism; there's a ziplock bag of beans on this shelf, one of rice on another, a jar of preserves here and three jars of honey there; nothing that screams \"delicious; take me home with you!\" The Cafe, however, is definitely a euphemism. The menu is scotch-taped to the counter. If you ask about the soup, the person behind the counter will point to a freezer behind you and tell you to get one yourself (I guess they'll microwave it for you, though I wasn't brave enough to find out). I ordered an omelette, which must have had a bit or two of pepper jack cheese in it because one of the bites I took had a hint of heat. It more or less looked like eggs with diced tomatoes and mushrooms inside, which at least looked fresh. There was also sausage (by mistake, and I'm glad I'm not vegetarian or this would have been a big problem). Even though I saw two loaves of freshly baked bread, the piece that came with my omelette was older than those.  The atmosphere looks like the place your grandmother may have played bingo at in 1982, complete with dated furniture and hard to miss dirty, worn out upholstery. I told the friend who found this online and suggested going that she's not allowed to pick restaurants any more."}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and I ate lunche this afternoon at the Paoli Cafe. My daughter is a vegetarian and they have several vegetarian options on the menu (which supposedly is \"made from scratch\" - or so says the sign).
   Our waitress was the twelve-year old daughter of the owner. I have absolutely no problem having a young family member learn the business. Yet, she knew very little about the menu and was not terribly willing to go back and get answers for our questions. (Perhaps a little more supervision would've helped - but there was no additional supervision given).
  We were given three glasses of water - no ice. The water is likely well water as it has an odor. We all understand well-water is well-water, so my wife asked our 12-year-old waitress if she could get a lemon wedge. I don't think the poor thing had any idea what she was being asked for - she just said we don't have that.
  On to our orders...
I ordered the egg salad sandwich, my wife ordered a trout salad sandwich, my daughter ordered a grain burger (vegetarian burger).  The owner came back out in a few minutes and let my wife know they didn't have trout. Instead, she ordered a bowl of chili. Also, the 12-year-old asked my daughter how she wanted the grain burger cooked which really seemed odd. Ummm, I don't know, \"cooked\" works. (Medium was the final answer.)
   I also ordered a diet pepsi ($2.50 for a 12 oz. can btw). The 12-year old brought out a diet coke. I asked her for a glass and received a deer-in-the-headlights look. She brought back a glass, full of ice with my soda poured over it. There was probably 6 oz. of soda in the glass -- but I did not get the remainder of the can (at $2.50 a can).  Oh, they do have cans of diet pepsi in the display case as well as coke products.
   The grain burger was ok - nothing spectacular but did have about a 1/2\" of onions on it (which my daughter removed). 
   The egg salad was fine - but also had a ton of onions in it (which I could not remove). 
   The bread is not homemade - it's pepperidge farm (they sell it in the attached store front).
   Now let's consider the chili. Recall, there is a sign saying everything is made from scratch. It came without any onions, cheese, sour cream or crackers and was bland and tasteless. Kwik Trip's chili puts Paoli's to shame (at 1/3 the cost). My comment was \"made from scratch in the kitchens of Sysco.\" Chili was terrible. 
   One last thing, throughout the meal, our glasses of water were never refilled.
   Overall it was a very disappointing $24 for lunch for three in a unique artisan based community. I expected better."}
{"text":"This place started as a grocery selling locally sourced food. They added a food prep kitchen and small eating area in the back (the Caf√© part). This place is worth seeking out for breakfast or lunch. This is a secret oasis in a dessert of processed food. Everything on the menu is made from scratch, and I mean everything. They raise and process their own meat and serve jam with their homemade toast. At the end you get a made from scratch chocolate mint candy. Try anything and everything and if you like it, you can buy the ingredients right there. I recently walked away with a package of their very own breakfast sausage, a jar of Kombucha and a small jar of the triple berry jam. In contrast to the fancy food served at other places in the area, this place keeps it simple and reminds us of what good food is. Please visit this locally-owned, but somewhat struggling establishment. They would love the business and I promise you will keep going back."}
{"text":"I love local and tasty food. These guys do alright and have a few things I haven't seen anywhere else. They also have espresso! I often just buy groceries, but every once an d a while I have eaten in the cafe. They are not fast but the food is good."}
{"text":"Bought local fresh curds and fresh cream in the grocery section, awesome! Had dinner tonight (7/3/14). Excellent service and delicious food. A buy local, buy fresh restaurant."}
{"text":"Came in here from out of town to check the place out. Never met a more rude man in my life working there. I was with an autistic kid who asked him about the wheat. He asked him what the hell he was doing. He told him he didn't have time for this and told us to go to the park across the street. There was nobody in the store. I will never ever be returning to this place and will be letting everyone I know hear about this. I never want to return to Paoli after this experience and hope this business is not open long."}
{"text":"3 words. best quiche ever!
It's a bit pricey but for the portion and quality it's totally worth it"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their food. I've eaten here twice and the breakfast was fantastic. I love that the owner grows most of the food, does the cooking and also serves the food!"}
{"text":"I had the awesome Paoli melt sandwich (smoked Gouda and kimchi belong together). The potato leek soup was also wonderful. My friend's quiche was also tasty. This is the place to stop for breakfast or lunch made from local farm produce, eggs and meats on your next drive or ride to Paoli."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here after Creamery Cafe was booked with reservations.  The breakfast was fabulous.  We had quiche, bacon and sausage.  It was really really good.  They use local ingredients, produce, meats and cheese.  Totally recommend this place and plan on going there again!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by hear once to try their grass fed beef.   It wasn't that flavorful and rather tough.  
I thought their selection was amazing and I would stop again to try some of their other products.
Not cheap so be prepared for higher prices.
They have alligator!  How crazy is that?"}
{"text":"On their way to New Glarus, most locals cruise through Paoli or skip it altogether. I happened through town this afternoon and noticed a sign that said \"The Locavore's Choice,\" so I had to stop and investigate. Sure enough, Paoli Local Foods is a charming store in a one-pony town, chock full of delicious, local products! There are cases and freezers stocked with local grass-fed beef, elk, deer, ostrich, chicken, duck, pork, lamb, and buffalo. There's a seafood case with smoked fish and frozen blue gill, halibut, salmon, etc.  I'm sure this list is even missing a number of their offerings. Oh, and did I mention their selection of local cheeses? Check.

Other products are available, such as small production organic canned foods and toiletries, but I won't lie--you can get these elsewhere in Madison for much less. All the same, it's cool that Paoli Local Foods is providing a much-needed outlet to this rural area. Another feature that I noticed, in the back of the store is a bulk section and also a small cafe featuring lunch items such as soup and sandwiches. Next time I'm going to the New Glarus Brewery with out of town guests, I think we'll make a stop here!

Lastly, I just found an article that talks about the store more in-depth: http://www.sustainabletimes.net/node/41"}
