{"text":"Ever since I moved to Calgary 9 years ago I have been coming to this restaurant. My family and I know the owners and their family, and are so welcomed whenever we come inside. The restaurant is beautifully decorated (even the bathroom is great) and I love the music that they play; I can't stand when Indian food places play pop music that is not conducive to the atmosphere at all.  The food here is absolutely amazing. I don't usually eat meat as I don't like the taste, but when I come here I love their lamb kebabs. The naan is wonderful, the samosas are always great (spicy but not too spicy), the pakoras are awesome and super crunchy, and I could seriously drink all of their sauces. I cannot rave about the food enough!  I have brought so many people here over the years and no one has been disappointed yet. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"While the service is very good, the food here is terrible.  My husband and I have eaten amazing Indian food all over North America and absolutely adore it so we were profoundly disappointed after wasting our money on the food at this restaurant.  Good Indian food is a culinary euphoria; incredible taste should be a given.  This food had no flavor.  It was tasteless with tons of heat so it just burned your mouth without any foundation to accompany the heat.  The chicken... akin to wet rubber.  I don't know when I have had chicken with that texture and I'm not sure what you would even do to it to get it like that??  My husband joked and said it must have been frog meat, not chicken!  We left most of the food in its dish and didn't care to even eat what was on the table which NEVER happens; we love food!!  Especially Indian!  The stars are for the service, the food is for the garbage.  Save your money."}
{"text":"Indian is one of my favorite cuisines. The aromas, flavors, just thinking about it makes my mouth water. I live pretty far south, and our selection of great Indian restaurants aren't as extensive as what's offered downtown. When I heard that Moti Mahal had a location in Midnapore, I made it a mission to try it.  The decor is nice. I like the mood lighting and the place felt like home with the fireplace in the middle. Service was friendly. They always made sure our water glasses were filled, offering drink refills, clearing the table, and also giving recommendations.  Food was disappointing. The portions were extremely small. My Lamb Roganjosh literally had two tiny pieces of lamb in it. The lamb was also quite tough and the sauce was severely lacking of any flavor. It was very lumpy and just not pleasant.  I was very let down. I'll admit that I'm a bit picky when it comes to Indian food. I know what I like and it makes me sad that I didn't enjoy Moti Mahal. It's also not cheap. Our bill came to over $60 and we were still hungry when we left. The hunt for a great Indian restaurant in the deep south continues!"}
{"text":"I have known the owners of this restaurant for many years. There are many true Indian cuisine restaurants around Calgary, however, this is one is the best in my opinion. The food is truly authentic and true. The food is absolutely delicious. The staff are courteous and professional. The ambience is quiet, comfortable and clean. Highly recommend you visit Billy and the team when you want true Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times in the last while. First time was good, didnt blow me out of the water or anything but i thought it was decent.   Second time i thought my prawn dish smelled of fish and was cooked to meh quality, nothing tasted very good and i left unimpressed.   Went again the other night and found the food to be amazing, full of flavour, hot out of the kitchen, tender meat and aromas were amazing.   I honestly cannot say why the quality seems to be up and down, perhaps the chef has changed i do not know.   Will try again to see how it is and HOPE it can keep with the consistency.  Edit: we ordered drinks one time, don't. The beer i had was skunky (old) and was really bad and the drink my partner ordered tasted of cream and Chai. Their Mango Lassi's are also dissapointing.   The prices are also a little high for what you are getting. Like most indian places you pay for the Curry, Rice and Naan separately, but i found the price of Rice to be high, the Curry is MUCH too high (15 bucks for sauce and meat?). The Naan is a good price however.   They also recently increased their prices as i noticed that the Samosas that we used to order had increased by a dollar (for 2 Samosas)."}
{"text":"If I could give more stars, I would! This is our go-to restaurant. Moti Mahal has spoiled all other Indian restaurants for us because it is SO good. We have been going there regularly for about 5 years and we always leave satisfied. Great prices, amazing food, massive portions and friendly staff. By far our favourite restaurant!"}
{"text":"I ordered a chilli chicken and vegetarian dish. The portions were not much considering it costed a total of $30 just for 2 dishes. The taste was nothing special... If you have the choice, take a pass"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and have never been disappointed. Staff are friendly and attentive. The food has authentic flavours (I am half Indian), but is not spicy at all. The portions are a bit on the small size. It is best to go with a group so that you can share several dishes. I have tried quite a few dishes on the menu and all have been good."}
{"text":"My family & I have been eating here infrequently since 2003 & have always always loved it. Tonight my wife will pick up \"take out\" - I'm excited?"}
{"text":"We've eaten at Moti Mahal at Midnapore Center three times now (twice in the restaurant and once as take out). At first I thought the food was really good, ordering the butter chicken and chicken tikka masala. However, I wasn't too pleased with the cut and texture of the chicken last time we ordered take out (this was our most recent visit as well). We always order the basmati rice, a raita and a naan or kulcha side to our dish as well, all of which are good, standard but good. Their veggie appetizer platter is good however I think their samosas are a bit potato-heavy. Other than that, the atmosphere is pleasant and staff is friendly. However, nothing out of this world but we will return because it's closer to home. There are better places for Indian food in the city in the downtown/Killarney region."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Don't let the strip mall fool you."}
{"text":"I've gone to Moti Mahal a few times. And I've never been disappointed. It's such a cozy restaurant with great food and a nice ambience. The bathrooms are clean and the staff is friendly. You don't have to wait too long for your food and there's a nice selection of beer if you wish and probably wine also.  When the wait was long it was worth it. But the ambulance is so nice that it's okay. Come to him with the Mahal hungry you won't be disappointed. The food is fresh and I've ordered everything from fish to lamb to appetizers and lentil dishes. The naan and paratas are fresh and hot.   This is a cute special little spot. If you are vegetarian there are many delicious options.  I suggest ordering, for two people, maybe one meat and one vegetarian dish with a couple different breads. samosas or meat on a skewer is a great appetizer. I've never ordered dessert because I'm always stuffed after dinner!"}
{"text":"By far our favorite restaurant!  Consistently delicious food, fantastic service and great atmosphere!  We went in to eat when I was pregnant and overdue with my son and their lamb roganjosh (sorry for my terrible spelling) put me into labour!"}
