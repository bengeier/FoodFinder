{"text":"Over all the experience was one of the best in Toronto. The broth was very on point. Very creamy and not too oily. The staff was very polite. The menu is quite small but I think the restaurant is stylized around a small theme. Given that their restaurant itself is in a cute little squeeze.  I had gotten the Tan Tan ramen. The bowl that it came in was absolutely stunning. Presentation is key with ramen and they did a good job of that. The food was average price for Toronto."}
{"text":"Best Ramen in the city. Good value as well.

They are quick at this location"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes when I read some of the reviews, I decided to come up and give it a try.

Not only were the staff grossly impolite and unattentive, the ramen noodles were chewy and the broth sort of cold. I've been many places for Ramen in Toronto, but I'm sad to say that this was my worst experience to date.

I'll stick to others for now."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's fair to give 5 stars to a place because of one dish, but I'd been hunting all over Toronto for ramen in a creamy tonkotsu, and I have found it. It's the creamiest by far. The broth is opaque and you can taste the pork bone-y goodness. I slurped up every last drop and can't wait to go back (which is actually a big deal as I don't eat out a lot and I haven't made the effort to return to any of the other ramen places I've been to so far)."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  There is nothing like a delicious bowl of Ramen when it's cold outside, which is probably why I am here almost every two weeks.

Service is quick and friendly!  Meal will set you back approximate $13 after tip and tax for just the noodles, a bit more if you get the crispy deep fried chicken app.

Would highly recommend the Tonkotsu Black (it has black garlic oil) or the Spicy Tan Tan Noodles (my favourite)."}
{"text":"I love ramen and I'm very sensitive about this subject.  When I had this ramen with spicy broth and that pork belly, I.Went.crazy! The pork belly was so tender it was like butter and the way it absorbed so much of the flavor of the broth it was pork perfection! Noodles cooked to perfection, and the soft boiled egg was the perfect finishing touch and it was a descent portion! Great price and great taste."}
{"text":"Came here on a date. Had the tonkotsu instead of the usual tonkotsu black (do you really want garlic breath?). Take my word and order an extra portion of noodles for a dollar and your stomach will thank you dearly. 

The order came super fast and if you plan to go for dinner, I usually get there around 6:00 p.m. to avoid the line up, albeit it's much shorter than the Dundas location.

However as a tea purist, I was surprised the $2 tea is served in a tea bag instead of brewed with full tea leaves. Hmm...But that's okay since the noodles are delish!"}
{"text":"Very delicious ramen, cake was on the expensive side but very yummy as well! Was surprisingly full for 3 pm on a Thursday, but we were quickly seated after a short wait outside"}
{"text":"Ramen was great, the noodle and broth were both excellent.  The fried rice was awesome.  Service was spot on.  Felt like I was back in Japan.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Reason to line up all over again - the NEW Sansotei Tomato Ramen!

I've been a loyal customer since they first open, and this is the first time I ventured outside of the Tonkotsu comfort zone and tried their new invention.

Incredible.   The broth has  very refreshing, slightly seafood-ginger sweet, unmistakably tomato taste.  The noodles (I always get the thick ones so it stays al dente throughout the 5 minutes that it takes me to finish the bowl) texture was consistent. As with their Tonkotsu, there are layers of aromatics that hits you before you taste that first spoonful - giving you that 'oh so satisfying' first impression.

To top everything off - you still have that sliced perfectly cooked soft boil egg - with yolk so smooth you literally dream about it at night -- and get this, a perfectly cooked scallop + thin pork is the jewel on top.  I'd easily say the scallop + pork, if served on a tasting menu, would have justified the entire cost.

On this visit, I've noticed that the owner lady is working (hard!) at the location. She typically stays at the Dundas one - so maybe service and/or food quality needed some 'straightening out'. Sorry for the pun, as I just dine there on Pride Parade Eve  :)

Oh, we're so fortunate to have Sansotei here in Toronto.  Saves me tons in airfare when that certain 'ramen crave' hits."}
{"text":"I tried their Tonkotsu Black. For $9.85, you get rich tonkotsu broth (made with pork bones), thinly sliced black mushrooms, a whole half-boiled egg split into two, cha shu, and thinly sliced green onions. It is the one with the black splotch of oily blackness on top, like in all the pictures.

I know many people love Tonkotsu Black, but here is why I wouldn't have it again. The \"black\" got tiring and overwhelming for me later into the bowl. It has a very smoky and addictive flavour and scent, so I loved it at first, but I started to taste the bitterness and heaviness of it as I was a little more than half into it. I told myself I was glad to try it once, but I wouldn't get it it again. If you like a fattier, saltier broth for your ramen, Sansotei is going to be right up your alley. 

Service was great. 

Like the yin and yang of the white and black of their Tonkotsu Black, I had positive and negative things to say about their popular ramen. Aside from the bitter taste that lingered on my tongue, everything else was commendable, and I can see why people like this place."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious food! Stopped in for lunch and snagged a spot at a shared table for the two of us (definitely looks like one of those small places that could get crowded really fast). Very reasonable prices for some very good food... was in a rush to get back to work, and the food came out quickly/service was great. Wonderful spot!"}
{"text":"Best ramen in downtown Toronto that I've had. Fast service and really tasty food. 

I've been here many times and have never been disappointed. The thin noodles and broth are very good."}
{"text":"Went to Sansotei Friday evening around 10h30pm. We were seated right away. The place is fairly small, I would not recommended it for large groups.

Order:
- Tonkotsu Ramen (Thin noodles)

Food:
Great ramen for the price, broth is creamy and rich in pork flavour but a tad bit salty. Noodles are springy with a nice bite to them. Chashu pork is nice and flavourful and did not feel too heavy or fatty.

Service:
Nice and quick service, friendly staff.

Price: 
~10$

Sansotei ramen is a must stop for ramen lovers, the tonkotsu broth is on point and the noodle and chashu are cooked just right. Taste is very similar to ramen in Japan. It has become a must stop everytime we visit Toronto."}
{"text":"Best Ramen so far of the places I have tried in Toronto. Had the tonkotsu black ramen with extra bamboo shoots and thick noodles.   I much prefer the thick ramen noodles, they are nice and chewy exactly how they should be. The bamboo shoots are soft and the wood ear fungus have a nice crunch to them. The pork belly is a nice thickness and delicious. The boiled egg is soft boiled with a lovely soft yolk. The broth is so silky and not too salty and very complex. You can tell that the broth was made over a long time and with love. If you are hungry definitely get the extra noodles for a dollar it is worth it. 

I'll be back and I'll bring some friends next time.

The place is nicely decorated and quiet enough for conversation. It is small so arrive earlier to avoid waiting for a table. The service is good and fast."}
{"text":"The spicy tan tan is a bit too salty. But taste great. And this location doesn't have as much people as the one in Dundas st w."}
{"text":"This was our go to place for Ramen. The spicy TanTan is so yummy. I always used to get the extra pork belly."}
{"text":"All ramen options come with pork, but you could substitute it with another topping. I got the tomato scallop soup with thin noodles. The soup base was very flavourful and it reminded me of tom yum soup without the spiciness. The noodles were nice and chewy and the soup came with a huge scallop. The portion was small, however, so don't expect to be full if you're starving."}
{"text":"The tonkotsu ramen broth is delicious, but little too oily for my taste."}
{"text":"Toronto seems to have a pretty big Ramen scene, and this place seems to be one of the top places to go to. I first tried the Tonkatsu black and found it overwhelmingly garlicky. The Tonkatsu flavor was rich and sweet and balanced over time but in the end could not stand up to the black garlic oil. I normally like my Tonkatsu ramen with more of a punch, as this was more creamy than the usual hearty Tonkatsu I'm used to.  I opted for the thin noodles and did not found them to have the kansui-wrought springiness I was expecting. 

The Shio ramen on the other hand was amazingly delicious and even more umami-esque than the Tonkatsu, which is strange to me as Tonkatsu is my usual go -to ramen type. This time I got the thick noodles which is more to my liking. Had I not tried the Shio ramen I would not really reviewed this place, but since I don't live in Toronto and don't know what the competition is like I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt since the Shio ramen was awesome, the service is good, and the appetizers are good too.

Overall a good place to drop by."}
{"text":"Great ramen for a great price! Not as good as momofuku noodle bar (the pork belly is better at the noodle bar) but for the price, you can't go wrong! It satisfied my ramen craving without breaking the bank. 

Service was excellent and quick! They are so friendly and make you feel so welcome :) 

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I couldn't even take a picture because the aroma when I walked in transformed my senses and swept me out of reality. The portion size is standard but the ramen is quickly served, comforting, appealing to the eyes and stomach, and above all else: delicious. 
The tonkotsu black is flavoured with roasted garlic oil which I now want to put on everything. It came with the perfect amount of noodles (I went with the thin noodles) and fixin's. I added extra shiitake mushrooms for an added cost of $0.75 but it was well worth it. 
Although I paid $15 for my meal I have to say that it was incredible and I would definitely go again because in the cold winds of winter it kept me warm and my afternoon more satisfying. 
The staff was polite and the decor was appealing, modern and the restaurant was cozy. Even with limited seating we didn't wait that long. 
This is definitely a gem on Yonge!"}
{"text":"Such a good ramen place in yorkville! Great spot for lunch. The service is quick and friendly. I got the tomkotus black and it was very tasty. Recommend this place to anyone nearby."}
{"text":"Had the Tonkotsu black ramen. 

It was definitely tasty, but a bit on the salty side. You won't get stuffed full, the meal is just right to make you content. 

Service was excellent, and fast. 

I will definitely return here again to try the other ramen!"}
{"text":"Great service. Always fast and always friendly.

I have only ordered the Tonkotsu Black Ramen so far. Soup base tastes great, and I find it not too salty. The black garlic oil adds a nice flavour and I highly recommend getting it. The pork is a little bland for my liking and there is a decent portion already with the soup so I wouldn't bother getting extra."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing! The restaurant was very cold. Our order came out quickly - too quickly! It seemed fairly obvious that the noodles weren't well - or freshly - cooked, and the broth was nothing special! It was just alright."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday at 1pm and had no lineup, but around 15-30 minutes later, more people came and there were line ups. Got the tonkatsu black and while the soup base was really good, the pork was really bad. It was stale and had no flavor, it felt like they were serving us leftover pork from the day before. As well, the noodle wasn't as chewy as I like, it was a bit too hard. But I got the thin noodle so maybe the thick one is better. The egg was really good though, very well done with the yolk slightly gooey."}
{"text":"Noodles were good, I prefer the thick noodle (which is not very thick) for the soups.  Fried Chicken comes in a small bowl, was tasty! And not dry and the lemon slice goes well with it. If you're looking to fill your ramen craving this would do it.  Its not a big menu if you're looking to be awed with variety."}
{"text":"Famous ramen, everyone going crazy about it 
We tried the original tonkutsu. 
Wow , I ate it in less than 10 mins haha. 
The broth is amazingly tasty. Thick , milky texture. Simply amazing 
The noodle , eggs, cha siu are above average. 
The broth though. 
Must try and so cheap , competitive price"}
{"text":"Decent value for the money.  Pretty limited menu.  One side of s card--ramen dishes, some sides and beverages.  I had the tonkatsu w/thin noodle ramen.  Excellent broth, good noodles and skimpy toppings.  Fine for the price though.  Servers were good.  Zero parking."}
{"text":"One of my favourite and most reliable ramen spots in the city.  Their spicy tan-tan is my absolute favourite! Add extra corn and come early before they run out of this limited broth. :) Highly recommend, and the staff are always so friendly and efficient, too!"}
{"text":"Originally planned on going to Sensotai on Dundas but as we were riding TTC, realized that they were closed on Sunday. Thankfully, the one on Yonge is Open so a change of plan was made.

There was a line up of thought 15 mins at 1:45pm, not so bad at all if you can get a spot inside and get to smell the broth & food. Opens up your appetite!
There menu is quite simple and offers pretty must the same sides than ever ramen shops or there. 

As a first timer, I go for the staple bowl: tonkotsu ramen with thick noodles and extra eggs. Side of wakame salad and karage. The food was served very quickly.

From my favorite ingredient descending: The noodles were thick and the perfect consistency. Almost aldente. Not sticky, perfectly chewy

The eggs shined: I could have eaten just that in the broth. The perfect ramen egg : soft yolk turning into smooth buttery goodie in the soup.

The broth has this delicious aroma and cloudy color. Perfect amount of salt sipped with the noodles. And clearly sooner of the pork fat melted in there! A great surprise.

Lastly, the tonkotsu:  well... I could survive without it. Its not special in any way. It's not bad but it didn't blow my mind.

The restaurant is very clean and the waitresses are welcoming. They have 2 bathrooms downstairs to your convenience.

To summarize it all, I'd recommend others to try it and  I will be going back

{"text":"Upon finding a new location that was closer to where I stayed at, I could not resist taking a shorter trip for the same food. It turns out my experience at this Sansotei was draatically different. 

I had regular tonkotsu and my companion a miso. Miso was way saltier than the original location. The tonkotsu had too much MSG in the broth. I walked out with a very bitter and sore tongue due to the amount of MSG that was in the broth. I don't know why this is the case for the yonge location. Hopefully they just had a very bad day with making broths when I visited. 

The zangi and basically everything else about the restaurant were excellent but the broth disappointed me very much. 

I recommend you pay visit to their original location for better ramen."}
{"text":"My favourite spot for ramen in TO! This location is close to Bloor-Yonge station and right by my school. I come here a lot and service has always been consistently good. I have always received my food within 10 minutes of placing my order. The servers are diligent and attentive. I always go for the Tonkotsu Black or the Miso Black (the garlic oil is delicious). I personally didn't like the Spicy Tan-Tan ramen. 
The venue is small so there's always a chance you'll be sharing a table with someone. 

FYI, They take cash, debit, and credit."}
{"text":"The Ramen here is great. I highly recommend this place. I eat here all the time in the winter. Service is great as the food."}
{"text":"I'm not a ramen expert but I had the Tonkutsu ramen.  The waitress suggested thin noodles so I went with that. The food was hot, speedy, and delicious.  Service was also great."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I typically stay clear of all Japanese ramen noodle shops because I prefer the flavors of other broth dishes such as Vietnamese pho or Chinese wonton soup. But I was told this place was the cream of the crop ramen spot in the 6ix and so I broke my ramen virginity for the 5th time, and gave it another shot.  Ordered the black tonkatsu ramen bowl because my lunch buddy kept on raving about how good it was even when I said I despise ramen. There were roughly 5-6 options for ramen and an abundant amount of appetizers to choose from; apparently the tomatoe broth is something out of this world good too by the way. The broth was creamy and flavorful. Noodles chewy. Again, I would opt for pho 100% rather than ramen. But if you're a ramen connoisseur, this will definitely live up to your expectations."}
{"text":"Best to get in the neighbour. Nothing it better than have this in a cold winter night.  I like tonkotsu black Ramen with extra bamboo shoot"}
{"text":"Tried Sansotei recently,  their Tonkotsu Black ramen is very nice, thanks to the garlic oil the smell is great. Soup density is high but not oily even had garlic oil inside, is not creamy as Kinton but both are nice, also chasiu there are traditional round shape, fat & meat portion is jus good and tasty. So far the best for i hv been tried. But the noodle quality was a bit hard and not chewy enough as Kyouka I tried last time. Servers greetings are more nice than Hokkaido and able to showing their cares by asking how do you feel for food and refilling water, also while was lining up staff always counting and taking care of customers.  Will be return and try their tomato ramen nx time."}
{"text":"Given that I'm not much of a fan of the small ramen scene in Rochester, I had to give this a spin while on a day trip in Toronto. This place has a lot of hype and I NEED a good ramen bowl to offset my hangry mood for the day.

The interior is simple with wood accents and mirrors on both sides. A giant rope runs across the top of this small restaurant from entrance to the server station, very simple but felt... Neat. Everything seemed simple and minimalist. Simple wood tables, simple black chopsticks, simple white crumpled napkin, simple water with a single ice cube, and also....

... My simple ramen bowl, which came out almost as fast as I ordered. I had apprehensions because the presentation was very plain and I could see the oil floating on top of my ramen bowl. I didn't know what was underneath and I foolishly based my lunch on looks rather than taste. But I trusted my friends, mixed it up, and oh mannnnnnn it was pure bliss.

I ordered the Spicy Tantan with thin noodles and extra shiitake mushrooms. I actually requested thick noodles, but the server heard me as thin. Great accident because I liked them. A lot. They were al dente, which finely complemented the chewy minced pork and soft egg. The shiitake mushrooms had a surprisingly sweet flavor to it, which was a great offset to the spicy robust flavor of the broth. The broth was not too spicy or too heavy either; it was light and satisfying. I'm not sure if it was homemade, I wish I had asked! It probably is. 

It has to be. I should go back and eat it again... For science, of course."}
{"text":"An flower on my plate
A sweet shiitake 
A young lady 

Food: 
What could go wrong, every time I come here my palate is pleased. Last night I had the black miso ramen and it came with an edible flower on pink and white tones, vibrant contrast against the dark soup and the pork belly.

Service:
Magnifique and those sweet shiitake mushrooms, magnifique. Service amenable, smiles and servitude. There is a reason Japanese excel in many areas. 

Decor: good use of blacks as background and the minimalist ambient, the uni strokes, well done, is the simplicity.

Fun fact: If you order the black garlic ramen don't bring your girlfriend, she will thank you later."}
{"text":"I dropped by Sansotei for a quick dinner last week, and having seen the lineups at other Sansotei locations, I was quite impressed to get a seat almost right away.

Although the restaurant itself is quite narrow, there is a decent amount of seating and the decor itself is quite nice in a minimalistic way. The table was cleaned and set as we were seating and our waitress was very friendly.

I ordered the Tantan Ramen which is a spicy broth with braised pork belly and ground pork. The dish itself was delicious and very filling, and the broth definitely warmed me up on a cold evening.

If you need your ramen fix and don't want to wait in line for hours, come here until everyone finds out about it!"}
{"text":"I tried the donkasu black ramen and it was sooooo gooood. There is another branch on Dundas that attracts so many crowds every dinner time. Personally, I found Yonge street branch much more delicious!"}
{"text":"Incredible Ramen. Plain and simple. You will enjoy! Spicy Tan Tan was delicious, cheap and cheerful."}
{"text":"Um it's pretty average ramen... Don't see what's the hype at all. Will not be back again."}
{"text":"The Tonkotsu Black with thin noodles is by far one of my favourites in Sabsotei. The broth is thick and flavourful, and the black garlic oil gives it the extra aroma. It's slightly more oily than I'd prefer, but it's worth it for the garlic taste. The noodles are firm and chewy, and compliments well with a spoonful of soup. 

The restaurant is rather narrow, but it's good for groups up to 6. The noise level is medium, service is quick, and the price not unreasonable (~$10) for a great bowl of ramen. They could have more dessert choices and better valued appetizers though. I got a bowl of seaweed salad for $5. I would've preferred less for a cheaper price, with more variety. Nevertheless, it's a great place for delicious, good-valued ramen!"}
{"text":"Lovely little place for ramen amongst the many restaurants that opened recently downtown. Sansotei have multiple locations, one of which came newly to Markham if you live uptown. It's is on the plaza on Hwy 7 where Whole Foods Is.

This location seats about only 30 people. You may or may not need to share a table depending on the size of your party.

Their ramen is delicious with a smaller menu than most places. There is only about 6 choices of ramen and some add ons. Includes your regular tonkotsu. They also have a tomato and a spicy one. I personally like the broth of the black. I find their ramen are basically same few things (eg. Poek belly, egg, etc.) and the only changes are the soup base. They also have sides/ appetizers and beer (sapporo and black Asahi).

I tried their spicy wings.. beware the spice does kick In but the meat falls off the bones. The gyoza is good but nothing special. 

Their beers are bottled not draft. 

Then i had the green tea cheesecake which was pretty decent. 

Service was decent. Nice polite people. Food comes pretty fast.

The only thing I'd really complain abt is that there are too many fruit flies ..... especially in the bathroom .... i hope they change that."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Sansotei

Hello boys and girls, your boy Sam's back!  Topic of the day: ramen.


And no we won't be discussing and analyzing the cheap 35 cents ramen brokeass students get from wallmart that tastes like nothing other than POVERTY.

Sansotei has easily become one of my favorite ramen spots in Toronto due to its great taste. I attempt to explain why I would highly recommend Sansotei in this post.


The 3 important aspects of ramen are the following:

1. The broth
2. The noodles
3. Toppings and others
.
.
At Sansotei, the broth is rather quite delicious and worthy of your time. Its richness and flavor will leave you wanting for more.
.
.
At Sansotei, you as the customer get to choose either the broader or thinner noodles. I went with the thinner one and am definitely satisfied with my choice. It was definitely more springy and harder when compared with the broader noodles that are softer that my friend got.
.
.
 At Sansotei, the broth to noodle ratio is pretty on point. This meant that as I'm about to finish my dish, I'm left with pretty much an empty bowl with neither too much of ramen or broth left. 

The toppings for ramen should be kept at a minimum so it doesn't disturb with the tranquility of the ramen dish with excessive flavors. And for Sansotei does a good job of that 


Rating: 8/10 .
Meaning of rating: A \"8 is definitely worth a visit\". Yelp rating: 8 divided by 2 = 4/5

Btw Sansotei is also very affordable for students!"}
{"text":"Their ramen bowls are just the warm hug you need on those winter's days 

From its soft tender noodles, the perfectly boiled egg, soft sweet pork belly and its flavourful broth.....this is one of the best ramen spots in the city. 

Yes there is usually a queue outside the restaurant but don't like it deter you as it moves fast."}
{"text":"Average, overhyped ramen. Tried the spicy TanTan ramen with thick noodles and am disappointed. It was overly salty, one dimensional and didn't have any depth of flavour. The noodles were were well cooked, al dente with a springiness to it. Eggs were also gooey but could have more flavour. Served with only one small slice of pork which could have had a smokier taste. Unable to add sesame seeds or chilli oil as a condiment. The soup itself is very underwhelming Touhenboku on Queen is much better. Nice, relaxed ambience with dim lighting, wooden tables and a modern but casual feel. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Was planning on eating at Ginger but the line to order was held up by bunch of self absorbed wankers who couldn't decide what they wanted and were asking 20 questions on everything. Rather than wait patiently in line I said screw them.  I'm going to Sansotei for my Tonkotsu Black with extra bamboo shoots.  

I had to wait maybe 10 minutes for a spot but the wait was well worth it. I can't express how deeply I love the rich porky flavourful broth infused with the dark garlic oil. It really elevates the bowl of ramen to a whole new level. Thanks to the wankers who held up the line at Gingers with their heads so far up their ass, I got the best ramen I so badly needed."}
{"text":"Almost the same layout as the Dundas location, except I wish there were singleton seats.

I love garlic so if it's somewhere on the menu, that's what I'll order. I love the Tonkotsu Black ($11.75) with thick noodles. I always appreciate that Sansotei ramen already includes the main toppings, including 2 pc of actually grilled chasui, green onion, fungus and 1 soft-boiled egg. Definitely hearty and fills you up on a cold day. Would prefer the quality of the ramen of this location over Dundas. 

It's a simple menu but it works. There may be a line but turnover is quick."}
{"text":"I like this place, it's fast, clean, and the food is good. A bowl would only set you back about $12 so it isn't going to break the bank. Overall, It's yum yum yummy. Yummy in my tummy."}
{"text":"i think Sansotei may be my fav/go-to ramen place.  I went there for lunch and had their tonkatsu ramen with thin noodles - portions weren't overly large, comes with a handful of ramen, 2 pcs of pork belly and a few strips of black fungus.  My fav part was the milky broth!  I had all the broth and was not super thirsty in the afternoon (unlike some of the other ramen places i've been)!   The place is small but the servers are very polite.  I'd definitely recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"Nice little ramen place that my friend and I randomly stumbled on since he was craving ramen. Not a bad discovery at all! Too bad its further south otherwise I'd like to revisit more often for ramen! Maybe I have an excuse now to go further south more often haha!

It's a small little restaurant that can get super busy and mind you it was one of those snowy days too! Luckily my friend and I got there at a good time (around late afternoon) and by the time we left it was getting busier.

Service was good, we were greeted with the friendly waitresses and waiters. Ramen was good in my opinion with a few different choices available on the menu. I mostly have ramen at Ajisai but this is another good location for sure.

If you are in the area, check it out!"}
{"text":"Easy to miss as sign is low contrast and small. Once you get a table, food arrives soon after."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best ramens in the city. I had the limited ramen and black tonkatsu. Thick noodles for both. The limited  broth is amazing probably the best tasting broth I ever had. The ramen noddles are on point. My only negative about this place is probably the crowded seating. In addition the matcha cheesecake is good. Prices are fair. I'd definately go back for more."}
{"text":"I knew coming to Toronto, there would be a Chinatown and I knew Ramen would have to be on my list of \"to eat.\" I looked up noodle places on Yelp to point me in the right direction and it led me straight to Sansotei! 

It is a small Ramen shop tucked away in a line of stores right off a main drag. It's a very small space, so I can see how this place gets really busy and there might be somewhat of a wait. Luckily, we came right before the rush and was seated immediately. We started out with green tea, an order of gyoza and I ordered the Black Miso Ramen with extra pork belly and egg and the friend ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen. He has actually never had ramen so I ordered what I thought he would like, and when I looked up from my bowl, he had devoured it! 

The broth was so delicious...It was one of the best things I ate on my trip to Canada, besides the awesome dim sum place down the street. Ramen in Toronto does not disappoint at Sansotei!"}
{"text":"Best ramen in Toronto, period.

Cozy warm vibes on a cold winter day. Nothing fills you up more than a nice bowl of ramen. The menu consists of only a few items. They keep it simple. They own their craft. 

The ramen itself is delicious. You know the broth is high in sodium but you don't care, you just tell yourself it's worth it and I'll drink more water later but we all know it doesn't work like that. Plus the staff is very kind as well. 

Only downside is prepare to wait during peak times. And when they do seat you, prepare to share a 4 person table if you're just a party of two."}
{"text":"Portions are generous and the ramen is delicious. Get the Asahi Black because it's hard to find elsewhere in the city. 

The sign outside is tiny - you might miss it if it's your first time."}

{"text":"Great place to stop in for a quick hot bowl of ramen. Not too salty. A bit garlicky. Extra noodles for $1 and be sure to get the thick noodles. Perfect for a rainy eve."}
{"text":"This place is my favourite ramen place in Toronto.  No ridiculous line ups and comfortable seating makes my ramen eating much more enjoyable.  Unlike other popular ramen places in Toronto, they usually never have a line up and they have nice booth and private table seating that is fairly comfortable. 

The food is great and I always order extra pork belly with my ramen.  The broth is nice and cooked to perfection and the noodles are always so fresh and well made.

I was a huge fan of their $12 ramen and beer special, but I suppose it was only a store opening promotion.  Hopefully they bring it back sometime in the near future though!

Overall a great ramen spot to eat at and my gf and I will surely come back for more very soon!"}
{"text":"The ramen here was truly amazing. The pork wasn't too bad, noodles were well done and the broth was perfect. The service was great and they told us ahead of time that it will take an extra 15 minutes for the Gyoza, which was fine with us. Overall, great place!"}
{"text":"I have been to Sansotei twice. The first time was a very interesting experience. The food was a bit salty but everything else was perfect. However, when I visited the second time, I realized that the menu is too simple and can bore you really quickly after the second time. All the Rame's pretty much taste the same. So if you like trying something over and over, this is a great choice, if you like to try something new every time, visit once!"}
{"text":"Ambiance gets a zero.  Pretty boring and the music was awful.

Service was nice. Efficient and friendly.  Food came fast, and was good.  Gyoza better than most but would have preferred a more flavourful dipping sauce.  Not as much choice as Ryus, and also no pictures so you better know what you're doing!

4 stars mostly for service and location being so close to where I live.  Ps I still don't like ramen, why does this keep happening to me?"}
{"text":"New location, doesn't get as busy as other ramen spots in downtown. They also have a good special, for 12$ you get any bowl of ramen and a Sapporo beer. The broth is very flavourful and not too MSG filled! I like the location, decor is nice! Love the bamboo tables and the washrooms are very clean."}
{"text":"Anytime I'm in that downtown area, this is usually my place to go to. I found this place after my good bud from Osaka told me that the flavour of the food here reminded him most of what he would eat back home. 

I have many a shirt with the battle scars of ramen broth thanks to the slurping down the bowls of ramen, and I wear it with great honour! The food is also very consistent between locations so fear not! Seating is also very comfortable and at a good level. I cannot tell you how many times I've gone to a restaurant and feel like a 5-year old sitting in a booth...

My personal fave? The Miso Ramen."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite before a movie. Order the tonkatsu ramen with thin noodles (9$). Really enjoyed the flavour of the broth. I didn't find it overly salty. My friend ordered the tonkatsu black and if you enjoy garlic I would recommend this for you. 
Friendly and quick service. Nice little joint to grab some ramen if you're in the Yonge bloor area."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm a bit more biased because I hadn't had a good, authentic bowl of ramen in a long time but yum!!! They had a simple menu with my favorite - Tonkatsu black. The black garlic oil was a lot stronger than I had wanted, so it might be wise to ask for it on the side so you can add it to your taste. They have a choice between thick and thin noodles, depending on what you want. We went for an early dinner so it wasn't very packed and we got our ramen quickly after we put our order in. The broth was rich and fatty just as I was craving for. Be prepared to feel a bit greasy after, but totally worth it. 

I wish I tried their infamous Tomato ramen, since I had never heard of it before. I'll be looking forward to eating here if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"Food is 10/10.  I've been coming here for years on a weekly basis. It has been my ultimate comfort food go to choice especially in a cold winter night, however one of the long term waitresses is absolutely miserable. She is always rude to me. She never smiles, only gives cold glances. I have not mistreated any service staff or shorted tips. I don't know what her problem is but she really should learn some manners. Sometime the thought of seeing her grimace even dampens the excitement of having my favourite ramen in town."}
{"text":"This has definitely been on my list of places to try ever since I came to Toronto. Like most ramen joints, the place is small but cozy. Unfortunately that means that the wait time is a bit long, especially when you are with a group of people. And no, you can't make reservations here either.

The service was average, not much to say. We were seated fairly quickly considering that we came as a group.

Their menu was did not have much variety. A few types of ramen, a couple of sides and then drinks-it all fit on one sheet of paper. Also, there was no vegetarian option for the ramen. I was hoping for more but that may have been too much to expect.

The miso ramen was good, although not the best I've had. The presentation was pretty, with a flower to add a touch of colour! There was a slice of pork belly to top it off (which was delicious btw). Tbh I was expecting more spice on the meat itself as the menu said \"spicy\" on it, but still yummy nonetheless. The noodles were okay, but I prefer softer noodles. It almost reminded of the instant ramen I use at home for stir fry. Lastly, the broth was really good! I found that it was pretty rich in flavour, which I very much enjoyed. 

Overall, I would say this place is worth trying (as long as you're not vegetarian). Although it was good, I have found other ramen joints that I prefer to go to."}
{"text":"I  came here for couple times already since it's really closed to my work place.
I like the taste of broth in this location better than the dundas one since it is less heavy and oily. 
Although i do think santoku has better broth, but i have nothing to complain about this ramen. 

Personally, i am not a big fan of the spicy one since i dont like the groudmeat. Tonkstsu and Shio are my favorate. Tonkstsu black is a bit heavy and oily fo rme. 

The biggest advantage of this place is no lineup and their ramen beer combo. Thats why i give them 4 stars."}
{"text":"Tasty tasty ramen! I suggest visiting a little after lunch time, but before dinner time because while I was eating..a long line eventually began to form OUT THE DOOR. I ordered the Tonkotsu Black and the Spicy Tan Tan (limited supplies). The soups were like no other I've tasted before, meticulously flavored and my taste buds were dancing with delight after the first bite. This restaurant is small, but there are many tables. You may have to share a table with a stranger if you're by yourself, but if you're on a date you'll get a private table! Service was amazing, and they constantly filled my water. Note, you can choose between thick or thin noodles; although I suggest thick so they can soak up the soup!"}
{"text":"There's a Sansotei on Dundas, and it always has lines whenever I pass by.
The Yonge location seems a bit more reasonable when it comes to wait times.
Or, just come outside of peak hours.

They have a simple menu: 6 types of bowls, a couple snacks, and some drinks and dessert.
Shoyu and Tonkotsu come with two slices of pork belly, while the others come with one. Of course, you can add a few extra slices of pork for a small fee.

There is an option to choose thick or thin noodles, but they all seemed pretty thin to me.
Broth is great. Noodles also have a lot of flavour from sitting in the broth.

I can see why so many people would be willing to stand outside for a spot."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch cause I always saw line ups at this place so I give it a try. 
Ordered the tonkotsu black thick ramen. 
It was ok but is a little too salty and oily for the soup because of the garlic oil they put in. 
So this meal comes with 2 pieces of meat, egg and noodles for $10.75 it is average price for ramen in toronto. Not very impressed with all the ramen in toronto. 
There is always line ups at this place is because the space is small so it won't fit as many peoples in the restaurant. 
Could give it a try if nearby the area. Service is ok not the best one cause most Japanese restaurant does better service than this place. 
Most reviews that gave 5 stars should go to Japan to eat the real RAMEN"}
{"text":"What in the blue balls does Sensotei actually mean? All I know is that I certainly feel like I could possibly be getting blue balls from my lack of eating at Sensotei. This place is definitely my new favorite hole-in-the-wall ramen shop. Quaint, authentic with minimalistic decor and menu. The giant rope hanging accross the ceiling makes me feel like Jane in Japan. Ramen is served piping hot, noodles are fresh and springy. Broths unctuous and full of flavor, and the egg yolk bleeding perfectly in my mouth at every bite. Jane is coming back, no doubt about it."}
{"text":"This place was packed even on a Tuesday night when I went there with friends. The seating is limited but they have nice booths in the back. They were out of a lot of things but it was still an enjoyable experience. All my friends got the Tonkotsu black which they add with garlic oil. They were out of there spicy Tan-tan broth. We also enjoyed their deep fried chicken, beef bowl and gyoza as appetizers. The appetizers are pricey for what you get but the ramen is totally worth it. Best Tonkotsu ramen I have tried in a while!"}
{"text":"We have friends and they love ramen.  Today, I ate at Sansotei and we really enjoyed it!  The fried chicken was quite good and I really liked my ramen.  I went with miso and the broth was quite lovely.  I like the skinny noodles so I was happy but of course, i can always use more noodles in my broth.  We had green tea cheesecake for dessert and it was a welcome surprise - quite good!  Overall, I am pretty novice when it comes to ramen but I enjoyed my lunch.  My only complaint is that if you can't finish you can't take it home because they do not have to go containers."}
{"text":"Didn't know they had a location so close to my work place! I went for lunch on a Friday with my coworker friends! We waited about 20 min since they don't take reservations which wasn't that bad. I got the Tonkatsu Black ramen with thick noodles and it was really good!! I would definitely recommend this one and I believe it's one of the more popular menu items. Service was friendly and quick which is great for lunch hour on a work day. The noodle portion we got that day seemed like on the small side. I usually am not able to finish any ramen bowl, but was able to for here. It's a just right portion for me but might not be enough for others. Not sure if this is a one time miss because I've had larger portions at their other location. Overall, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm hard to please when it comes to ramen. I've been to places where the broth is too salty (i.e. Kinton), the noodles have weird texture (i.e. Ramen Raijin) and other places with mediocre ramen. Obviously this is not the best thing in the world, but it's probably one of the best ones in Toronto. Their broth are always so tasty and full of flavour, but they don't overdo it. The noodles are delicious, both thick or thin. I also enjoy their pork belly because it's not too fatty and it's tender. It's great, no line ups and the menu is straight to the point. This is where you go for great Ramen and nothing too fancy. Atmosphere is relaxing and it's not too loud or busy. Perfect for really cold days."}
{"text":"Great Ramen don't come around typical dinner times because there's more than likely going to be a line up here, not because they have the best Ramen in town but due to inadequate seating. Place is too small, Ramen seems to be the thing to get nowadays they should have planned better. Spicy tan tan got me through a few colds this year so I'll give them that, this is my go to place when I'm craving that spicy bowl of noodles. Chicken karaage is pretty good here too."}
{"text":"I was not a big fan of ramen until I tried Sansotei. This spot is my favourite for tasty and well-priced ramen. I've tried other ramen places such as Kinton and Kenzo at various locations and those could not even compare to Sansotei. The broth here is delicious, there is a decent amount of toppings and noodles, and the noodles are perfectly cooked. If I'm hungry I always add extra noodles on the side after I finish my noodles. I would recommend either the tonkatsu (with or without the black garlic oil depending on what you prefer) or the tomato ramen (my personal favourite)."}
{"text":"Solid no frills ramen joint. I could feel the passion of the chef course through my body as I slurped the (thick) noodles. The broth was creamy and medium bodied. The Zangi was also quite juicy and I felt my mouth bursting with the umami flavors."}
{"text":"My only complaint was that I wore pants that were too tight. I was only able to woof down one bowl with extra noodles, and no room for other food. I'll be back again to try out the rest of the menu. 

The noodles were done just right. Great texture and flavour. The soup done to my liking and I was pleasantly surprised that the pork was lightly fried. Job well done!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place! Their ramen is the best I've ever had in Toronto, and I've tried most of the ramen places. Their broth is creamy and flavourful, and the pork is perfectly tender. The noodles are chewy with a nice texture. I usually go for the Shio or Shoyu, but they're all really good. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"We got the Tonkotsu and tomato ramen. The Tonkotsu is the original and pretty good. The soup was smooth and velvety and the noodles had great texture.  I wish I had put a few more 'extra toppings' in hindsight as it seemed like the focus was more on the broth and noodles.  The tomato ramen was definitely lighter but still flavorful.  Next time, I would try it with the garlic sauce."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here a few weeks ago and now I am on a ramen rampage. The spicy tan tan was amazing and soothing on such a cold night. I loved it so much I came back the next night with other friends. Unfortunately they were out of the tan tan so I tried the tonkatsu black. I also got a taste of my friends miso black & tomato. Such complex flavours it's hard to fully describe but nothing short of a foodgasm. I will be back as often as possible!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch one day and I walked straight by it the first time as I did not see their entrance at all. 

I got the tonkatsu black ramen. I was not a big fan of this as the broth was extremely salty making the whole experience terrible. I did not enjoy the saltiness of the broth at all and I had to drain all my noodles before I could eat it. 

I definitely would not come back because all I could recall is the saltiness of the broth."}
{"text":"No doubt why this place is so famous and always has a line up during meal time. I went there a bit before 6pm, there was no line up yet but just 5 minutes after, already 10 people were waiting outside. The service was very fast. The staff are super nice and friendly. The ramen is just amazing as I thought it would be."}
{"text":"Tonkotsu black is what I went with. It comes with two pieces of chashu, a soft boiled egg, black fungus, green onion and topped off with roasted garlic oil. You have the choice of thick or thin noodles. I prefer thick. The broth was creamy and full of flavor. The egg was cooked perfectly with the runny yolk. There are lots of ramen restaurants, but I'm glad I picked this place."}
{"text":"Finally got to eat here today !! One because I've been home sick for 5 days and all I could think about was a nice big bowl of Ramen. First time outside thought it was maybe too soon but as I approached the line out front I started to get butterflies in my stomach knowing I was going to have a wonderful lunch. 

Didn't wait in line long maybe 20 min. Thank goodness it was nice out and not too hot.  

I was seated and ordered hot tea, Gyoza and Tonkotsu Black with thin noodles 

The place is small and layer out well to accommodate 8 tables of four and two small booths for 2. The decor is pretty minimalistic, but love the ceramic thin tile walls at first glance it looks like rattan and then up close you see it's thin strips of tile  and the woven rope threaded from front to back is simulating Ramen. 

Service is fantastic, polite and just so accommodating. Five staff members all hustling and smiling (which is always nice to see)   

I thought my favourite Ramen house was in Vancouver, but this Ramen house is pretty much tied for the honour."}
{"text":"Best Ramen place ever. Really great food, fast and friendly service and a nice interior. Also fairly priced."}
{"text":"I came here with a coworker who is a huge ramen lover and he said this place was pretty good.  I, on the other hand, am not the biggest fan.  I've only been to a specialized ramen place once, which was Kenzo in Mississauga.  I thought Kenzo was overly salty and kind of pricey plus the noodles were not the greatest.  

Here at Sansotei, I had the Shoyu ramen, which is basically pork belly and egg for $9.50.  The actual noodles here were great as they seemed be handmade and possibly al dente.  However, I found the broth to be slightly salty and the overall meal to be quite pricey for $9.50 as it only came with two pieces of pork belly and one egg.  If it was cheaper, like around $7, I'd probably give it four stars but the value doesn't seem to be there for me.  

BUT I may visit again in the evening as it is $12 for Sapporo and a bowl of ramen (which my co-worker got) so you are paying less than $3 for a beer, which is great.  

Overall, I can't say that I'm a fan of this place, but I'm not going to jeer them either. It's A-OK."}
{"text":"Santosei has a small menu of about 6 ramen choices and a few side dishes. The spicy tantan ramen sells our quick, so if you want something spicy, go early. 

The fiancé ordered the tonkatsu black ramen (pork bone broth with a black garlic oil). It was served with 2 pieces of cha siu, baby black fungus,and a medium boiled egg. He said he didn't enjoy the garlic oil in his ramen because it made the dish taste burnt. I got the miso ramen and asked for a spicy pepper to give it some kick. My ramen came with cha siu, corn, bean sprouts, and a boiled egg. My ramen was good, but a little salty. The broth was very flavourful though. I liked that the egg was boiled, but had a runny yolk. I don't know if the egg was supposed to be a marinated tea egg, but there was some colour on it, which makes me think it was supposed to be. The egg itself didn't have much flavour to it, though. The cha siu was deliciously tender and melt in your mouth. 

Overall, the ramen was good. Decent price and the service was very quick and polite. Our water was constantly being topped up, which as a server, I greatly appreciate."}
{"text":"The ramen was absolutely amazing. The soup was rich but not too overwhelming, and the meat wasn't dry or anything. Their service was really good and always wore a smile. 

The cake was great too. I loved the flavour and the bits of sakura flowers in it. Was just the right amount of sweetness. Very refreshing!

Recommend!"}
{"text":"The best ramen in town. love it very much. for this new location too"}
{"text":"Soooo good! I'm not a ramen connessieur by any means but after a friend recommended this place to me - I decided to give it a go... I will be back! Fast, cheap and delicious ...you really cannot go wrong. I felt like I was devouring a big bowl of comfort food... the broth was on point and it's kinda fun to eat with the little spoon and chopsticks they give you. The only thing is that there may be a bit of a language barrier with the workers but they're all so sweet and cute! Oh and if you hate slurrrrrrrpers or loud chewers like I do, I highly recommend grabbing it to go... also note,  there is no vegetarian option (don't judge me if that's a common thing for ramen dishes) but I love my meat so no difference to me. For $13 after tax and tip, I almost had to be carried out of the place.... mmm!"}
{"text":"It's hard to put your finger on why this place is good but I suspect is a combination of the great noodles, decent topping and of course the soup/broth that hits just the right spot.

Be warned the soup is a bit salty and feels it has plenty lard in there but IT IS satisfying!

My only wish is for them to have continuous hours instead of the current open-close-open. It makes it impossible to visit the place between traditional lunch or dinner hours which is a shame."}
{"text":"My friend said it was very good and worth of trying so I did today. The menus is very small. If you don't eat pork belly then don't come. The noodle came and it looked good. The bowl is certainly small and the taste is average. I was hoping for a 4 star Ramen at least. The Gyoza is pretty good but also small. For the price they charge is not reasonable. My bill came to $36 with tax because the green tea is $4. The waitress is nice and quick. I probably will not come back because there are better ramen and better price then here"}
{"text":"This location of Sansotei is pretty similar to their other location on Dundas.  If you're a fan, now's the time to go without having to deal with the line-ups and crowds.

Everything's about the same, right down to the limited seating and decor.  It's still one of my preferred ramen joints in town!"}
{"text":"Have been to Sansotei many times and this is an overall rating. They don't do Ramen fancy, but they do it right. They are not like Raijin that has intense flavour and various combinations nor Kinton that features meat and fat in the soup. If you wanna grab a quick, standard but delicious Ramen lunch - Sansotei won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Super overrated. 200% disappointed with the quantity of their ramen. The ramen costed  me $12 for a small bowl of ramen with one egg and TWO pecies of pork belly (pork belly is one of the cheapest part from pork). the soup and noodle was not even that great. I would rather have a decent extra large pho for 10 bucks with tons of beef and noodle."}
{"text":"I felt strongly that I should leave a review because this is definitely not close to the best ramen Toronto has to offer. The noodles taste ok, but not great. The tonkotsu broth I had does not even blend well with the noodle taste. The black fungus is tasteless and cold sitting on top of the noodles. For its price it's OK but definitely won't visit again."}
{"text":"Came here with friends as last option as everywhere were closing. Asked the waitress last call and she said \"closing at 11:00, last call at 10:55\". Thats amazing!

Ordered a regular size Tonkotsu Ramen with thick noodles and shared a Zangi and Gyoza. Waitress suggested thin noodles though.

The broth was rich and creamy. Noodles were chewy and pork was tender. It was good overall, but could be better if there was a bit less broth and more ingredient.

The zangi wasn't too crispy, just enough to taste the tenderness of the chicken. The gyoza wasn't my favor as it taste more vegetable and it didn't have enough filling."}
{"text":"Good place to come for yummy ramen!
Their restaurant is really small but it seems to be easy to get a spot. My 2nd go to place if I'm in the area and craving ramen. Price is standard with other places, and would come back when I get the chance."}
{"text":"Worst \"Japanese\" ramen I've ever tasted.
They have this stench on their soup broth where it makes it impossible to taste the tonkotsu...
Their \"special\" chicken they advertised look liked fried red spicy wings...but it came out brown and steamed...and had the oyster sauce funk. 

I was craving Japanese ramen during my trip here and after coming to this restaurant first...I was traumatized to try any other ramen houses in Toronto o.o"}
{"text":"Ramen competition in DC is slowly catching up to present day, but the best bowl in the DC area can't even compare to the average bowl in most other metropolises. During a short trip to Toronto, I decided to allocate a meal to Sansotai... If they have so much success to open up three locations, they must be doing something right.

Thin noodles were perfectly chewy, definitely recommend going that route. In comparison, the thick noodles seemed a bit more soft without enough chewy bounce back. Tonkatsu broth is nice and light while Black Tonkatsu has a deep smokey flavor. I really enjoyed the Black Tonkatsu, but don't drink all the soup or else that black oil will come back to haunt you shortly after the meal. 

The braised wings were a great start to the meal. Meat was falling off the bone, so it's chopstick friendly. The gyoza had perfect crispy skin and soft meat filling inside.

Everything about this meal was very fast and efficient, from the seating, ordering, the delivery of the food, to closing out the bill. I imagine they have to be, considering how limited the seating is."}
{"text":"Best place to grab authentic Japanese Ramen and other famous Japanese dishes. Friendly hostesses and fast service."}
{"text":"I got the spicy tan tan noodles and it was just ok.  You just taste the spiciness; not much for what you pay for. Just some noodles, one piece of meat, a bit of vegetables. Relatively lacklustre in overall taste.  To be honest, Santouka or even Kenzo down the road is much better.  Not bad to try but probably won't return to this place."}
{"text":"They were out of Spicy Tan tan by 6.30 pm so we ended up getting alternatives. They were also out of cola...I don't know. How can you be out of cola? 
I prefer the dundas street location and if that's not possible, Ramen Isshin is better when it comes to quality of ramen."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here to satisfy a major craving for traditional ramen. The favorable reviews led us blindly to try this little place out. Forewarning: there is a bit of a language barrier, so if you aren't versed in Japanese be prepared to immerse yourself! The menu is limited, but fairly priced. All the ramen has a pork belly broth, so vegans and strict vegetarians may not find something here. I tried asking if there was actual meat in a particular dish, but I'm not sure our waitress understood my question as I did end up with two pieces of pork I gladly gave up to my carnivorous boyfriend. I chose the tonkatsu ramen with the black fungus. Sounds freaky, but really has a warm umami flavor reminiscent of chicken and dumplings! It was good, but not to die for. Filling, but not overly rich. Pretty much right in the middle without disappointing. For dessert we shared a yuzu cheesecake with matcha filling that was over all to quickly. I could eat about a hundred of those, easy. Overall, fair experience with good flavor that makes you feel as if you're in a coastal contemporary haunt in Japan."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE fan of Sansotei ramen. If the food has the same taste as other locations, same quantity (or more haha) and the service is good, it'll always be a 5 star for me. 

It's been the 2nd time that I'm visiting this place in 1 week, and both times I ordered Tonkotsu Black. I LOVE the garlic flavour together with the broth and the noodles. I usually ask for chilli powder to add some spiciness to the meal and I usually get thin noodles just because I feel like I have more noodles to eat.

But last Sunday I decided to try out their thick noodles and I got extra thin noodles on the side, just to eat both types. Their think noodles are more chewy and I felt like it was done before I expected it to :(. Anyway, I'm biased because noodles are my favourite food in a ramen (not the pork, I usually give my pork to somebody else). But I've heard lots of people ordering think noodles with this kind of broth. 

I've never ordered other ramens but I've tasted Spicy Tantan and Tomato. They're very different in flavour, but they're both delicious. The spiciness in spicy tantan is on point for me. It's not too spicy to the point where the food becomes unenjoyable. 

I will definitely go back again and again."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for good ramen after a day out in the cold. However when we arrived, we had to wait in line outside! Luckily the wait wasn't too long, maybe 5-10 mins. We got lucky that party of 5 decided they didn't want ramen anymore and left, and several parties inside were getting ready to leave. Once inside, we reviewed the menu and ordered the Black Miso ramen and the Tonkatsu ramen, each with thick noodles. No apps because we were saving room for their black sesame crepe cake for dessert! 

The Black Miso ramen was very rich, but so satisfying! Their Kakuni was perfect. Hubby didn't like that the char siu was so thin but I gave him half my kakuni so he was happy after that. 

I haven't tried any other ramen in TO, but Sansotei is up there among the tastiest I've had. 

The Black Sesame crepe cake wasn't anything to call home about. Lady M's green tea is still the best. When people do black sesame anything, there never seems to be enough black sesame flavor! We still love crepe cakes though and will continue to try different flavors whenever we encounter them!"}
{"text":"The food was good but it had very limited options and the place was quite small where a table that fits 6 people was shared with three customers. But the service was kind and the price is good"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best ramen I have ever tasted. Many ramen restaurants had failed me in the past. Therefore, I did not have much faith or interest in ramen for a really long time. However, my cousins once strongly recommended this place when I traveled to Canada. OMG let me tell you, not only Sansotei changed my opinions about ramen, but also my passion of eating ramen has come back. 
My favorite dish is TOMATO soup ramen. The seaweed salad tastes delicious as well. The first time when I traveled here, I tried the restaurant that located in China town, Toronto, the second time/location was close to where my family lives, and this location (Yonge) was my third time. Every time is consistently excellent, just like the first time I had it.
Every time I travel to Toronto, Sansotei is a must-go ramen restaurant. Definitely recommend it! Love it!!!"}
{"text":"So I want to preface by saying this place could have easily gotten a 5 star rating...if it wasn't for the salt content. 

I'm surprised that Sansotei, aka \"the best ramen in Toronto\" would make such a novice mistake. I've been to Kinton ramen at least 10 times, and out of the ten, I've never had an inedible bowl.

It was about a 15min wait, and we arrived around 8:30 pm. Not so bad. We get seated, server is super friendly and prompt. My boyfriend and I both get the black tonkotsu, and when it arrives, I notice that the broth is a bit salty, but it doesn't bother me. My boyfriend mentions it is really salty but he powers through. Only when he finishes all the ramen and the toppings, I take a sip of his broth and his broth is 3 times saltier than mine. Nearly inedible. BF now realizes it was his mistake was not mentioning it earlier, but now we know better."}
{"text":"Perfect steaming bowl of ramen and less busy than the Dundas street location.  The fried chicken appetizer and mochi dessert (green tea and mango pieces) were also hits."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.
I have to thank Meena and her boyfriend Denis for recommending this place.
Their menu is small but their food was amazing.
My mom got the tonkotsu black ($9.85) and I got the spicy tan tan ($9.60).
Both were unbelievably good.
The spicy tan tan wasn't extremely spicy, the broth was so delicious. I got the thick noodles. It came with pork belly, an egg, and ground pork. I wouldn't change a thing about it. I was stuffed after eating it.
My mom and I split the gyoza, they were tasty, my mom loved them, I thought they were good but not my favourite.
We split the matcha mousse cheesecake ($7) for dessert. It was new on the menu.
I didn't like it.
The ramen is definitely why you come here, and a lot of people do, it was packed.
We ended up waiting about 10 minutes for a table, around 3 PM on a Friday. The food was well worth the wait.
I cannot wait to go here again."}
{"text":"Evidently this place is very popular because we had to wait a bit before getting seated. My friends and I ordered two Shoyu, one Tomato, and one Tonkatsu Black, all with \"thick\" noodles. Except the thick noodles are actually quite thin/regular so I felt that was misleading! I've only been once so I can't comment on how thin the \"thin\" noodles would be. Flavor was salty but excellent overall and rich enough to feel full (even though the bowls are small). People who don't like pork broth should be aware that this place doesn't offer any other option."}
{"text":"Been to a lot of great ramen places in Canada and Tokyo and have to say Sansotei is our favorite. The Tonkotsu with black garlic is the best we've had although some may find it too rich for their liking. 

Service is efficient. There's usually a lineup at Dundas location so we go to the Yonge location. Looking forward to the third location opening in Cityplace."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of ramen before coming here with my friends for the first time. Looking at the menu, I appreciated its simplicity and went with the Spicy Tan Tan with thick noodles because I enjoyed the ingredients even if I had to brace myself for the spice.

The service was pretty quick, especially for a group of seven people, and looking at the broth, it confirmed my fears that it would be too spicy, but it wasn't the case for me! My friend ordered the same and he felt the spice more. I would say it's more numbing than pure hot and the difference is why we reacted differently.

Usually I'd sweat through my bowl of ramen, but it was pleasant. The broth was very aromatic, the noodles that were thick were great, and it left me with the right amount of being full.

I wish they included more meat or noodles, but the portion size of everything else was great.

The server was great at making sure to get our orders correct reading it back to us before sending it to the kitchen."}
{"text":"Had their tonkatsu ramen with thin noodles... It was great! Ramen has bite and pork belly was seared so it didnt feel like it was greasy and heavy. Very nice and ambience is much better than Kinton Ramen!"}
{"text":"So I will say it. I think Sansotei's Tonkotsu black is the best ramen in the City.  Its not an open and shut case, but the depth of the soup is just hard to match in Toronto IMHO. One area where I believe they fall short though is the egg. Kinton does a far better job with the egg both in flavour and texture.  Now if only I could get Sansotei's Tonkatsu black with a Kinton egg......"}
{"text":"Ordered: shoyu ramen with thick noodles.

Review: one of my more preferred ramen joints in Toronto. With these soup noodles, the broth is very important and they seem to have got the flavour just right (not too salty). For its price, the amount of toppings they include are reasonable although for those looking for more meat, you can always add additional pork belly in your ramen. Would definitely recommend those looking for a casual and fast dinner and warm soup to fill their tummies.

Interesting tidbit: anyone else notice how they always place your ramen bowl with the store logo facing you?"}
{"text":"I usually go for Tonkotsu Ramen there. Was pretty good. And Goyza is not bad though but the price isn't good. Also I like their Zangi! It's good match with the Ramen. I'll must go again!"}
{"text":"The only problem with eating at a good restaurant is you sometimes have to wait for a table. This is particularly true at Sansotei, but the price is unbeatable.

I'm from the Midwest United States, where \"ramen\" is still often pronounced \"RAY-muhn\". *facepalm* Ramen is just starting to make its way into the area, and the locals screw it up by hipsterizing the hell out of it, making it unorthodox with weird toppings and charging exorbitant prices for it (like $17). Sansotei feels quite traditional to me, and I was satisfactorily full for around $10 Canadian dollars. My girlfriend and I both ordered the tonkotsu variety, and I simply thought the blend was well crafted. I went with the typical thin noodle, while she chose the thick noodle (no jokes about my girlfriend liking a thick noodle, please).

Regarding the wait I alluded to, it took quite a while to get seated (and we were just second in line). Seating is limited, and people seemed to have a way of screwing around and chatting after they finished their meals. During our visit, anyway. Luckily, the food came right out.

Oh, you also actually get large water glasses at this ramen place!!! My least favorite thing about my trip to Japan (besides the fact that there were no public trash cans, like, anywhere) were the tiny water glasses everywhere. You know how you get really sweaty at ramen restaurant because you're always leaning over the food to slurp? Thanks for catering to the North American style of consuming a large amount of food and drink, Sansotei!"}
{"text":"Limited menu but it doesn't matter, the ramen is fantastic. At first the portions seemed small, but it was the right amount, great flavour.  Cant wait to return."}
{"text":"Love this place. Consistently great ramen and friendly service. One thing I really like about the ramen here is that it is not too creamy or heavy like a lot of other places. My favourite is the tonkotsu black, however, I heard that they have a new miso one that's amazing."}
{"text":"I always tell people that ramen is a pretty personalized experience, and for me personally, Sansotei is the best there is in Toronto. This particular location is nice because it doesn't get as busy as the location over in Dundas but these days I do feel like it's gaining traction, and I'm starting to wait longer and longer to get a table. The wait is definitely worth it for me though.

When I say ramen is a personalized experience, what I mean is that each person has their own preference for how they like their ramen. Some prefer the noodles to be more chewy, the broth to be more salty, the flavour to be more meaty and so on, but I prefer my ramen to be less salty and less chewy - so compared to Kinton or Santouka, the ramen here is on the lighter side. It's nice to not be dehydrated for the rest of the day after a bowl of ramen.

It also surprises me that their gyoza is actually the best I've had in Toronto. They look so small and meh but they taste much much better. The flavour just explodes in your mouth the instant you bite into it, and just writing this review makes me want to hop over and grab a plate of gyoza... which I will likely do. I've also ordered their Zangi, which is basically Karaage, which was just alright. Definitely had better elsewhere.

Service here is friendly and efficient, and the food comes out quite quickly, as they should at a ramen joint. Sometimes you will have to be seated next to strangers if the place gets busy, and while that is commonplace in Asia, I find some people can get uncomfortable with that over here for some reason. You can of course request for your own table but you may have to wait a bit longer. Thankfully, people typically don't take a long time eating ramen, so the wait usually won't be too long.

But the star of a ramen restaurant should be the ramen, and the ramen here definitely shines the brightest imo over here in Toronto. I frequent this place quite often to the point I sometimes get a bit embarrassed when the servers recognize me, but the stomach wants what it wants. Oh well~"}
{"text":"Delicious ramen with a very nice, contemporary costal vibe. The menu is very forward, and the staff are hospitable. A great place to get a nice noodle dish!"}
{"text":"This was a great ramen location~! After trying ramen in New York and Chicago, I can give this a good rating. Not an extremely amazing ramen, but it's filling and aesthetically on point. It is slightly salty and they don't have a lot of spicy options so I would recommend the miso black for sure pictured here!"}
{"text":"Wanted something warm and comforting, and decided on Ramen.  Did a bit of searching on Yelp and there is was.  Sansotei, just a few blocks from my hotel.  

Walked in and even though it was after 8p on a Wednesday, there were people waiting for tables.  There were 2 sets of couples in front of me, and I think I waited a grand total of 7 mins before a table became available for me.  

Was lead to a table (table for 4 even though I was by myself), and was given a menu.  I had thought there would be more on the menu, but no it was very small and limited. I was seated at a table that was near the back and it's where all the servers entered the orders.  I noticed they were all speaking Japanese to each other.  A very good sign.  I decided on the Tonkatsu Black.  I waited for less than 5 mins and my bowl of Ramen-ee-goodness was placed in front of me.  I was very hungry and it smelled so good that I almost forgot to take a photo of it.  Great broth, perfectly cooked noodles, and hot and steaming. 

After nearly inhaling the ramen, I thanked my server (in Japanese of course) and paid my bill.

Overall, Staff were very nice and very attentive.  The ramen was top notch... unlike many other ramen places, where the broth is overly salted, Sansotei has a great broth.  Noodles were perfectly cooked too.  Grand total for bill $12 !  (excl tip).  Yup that's it !  I think I've just found my new ramen goto place !"}
{"text":"There's nothing to dislike about this place. The food and service are good!"}
{"text":"First time at this location but I've been to the other location before. I came with 4 other people and we were seated at a booth. Similarly to their other location, it was a bit cramped since 3 people had to sit on one side that was meant for 2. I was disappointed to find out their miso ramen has been discontinued. However, that gave me the opportunity to try the spicy tan tan ramen (limited quality daily). I was reluctant to get it at first in case it was too spicy but it tasted amazing. There were thinly cut peppers, ground pork, an egg, and a piece of pork belly. The downside is needing to wait outside since it's always full but their service is very quick and you'll be warmed up in no time."}
{"text":"My favourite of all the Japanese Ramen places. The broth is more intense. I always order Tonkatsu Black with thin noodles. It comes with an egg with a runny yolk, kelp, two pieces pork belly and scallions. The Zangi (fried chicken) is a nice addition to go with the ramen. The service is fast and consistent. There may be a short wait at peak times."}
{"text":"Sansotei is arguably one of the best places to grab a bowl of Ramen if you're ever craving a meal that is salty, savoury and satisfying.

Whenever I come here, there is often a line-up that I need to be in before I get seated. This usually lasts about twenty minutes or so, but since this place has such a distinct taste that makes me want to come back for more, I do not mind the wait at all.

The bowl is a great portion, with the option to add in extra noodles and other toppings for a small price. I have a friend who always asks for additional noodles in his soup and you can definitely tell the difference between a normal portion and an additional serving. The consistency at this location is great and I know I can reliably come back to this same place over and over again and not be disappointed. 

The décor and washrooms are all well maintained and it feels very cozy, despite the limited tables. The service at this location is great as well, with the waiters constantly coming back and giving refills on water.

Overall, this is a great place to grab a bowl if you're OK with the wait. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"4 stars for good ramen in good price

I got nothing to complain about this place, but I did not get addicted, so 4 it is!"}
{"text":"Very quaint ramen place along Yonge. Attentive and kind servers. I really enjoyed the Spicy Tan Tan, it's not spicy at all and the broth is very flavourful!."}
{"text":"Very tasty, great-quality ramen. Beautiful pork slices (not too fatty) and nicely cooked eggs.

As for which broth is best, I've only tried two: tonkatsu (pork bone broth) and tonkatsu \"black\". The black version is doused with pungent garlic oil, and definitely has a nice depth of flavour. But my preference is the regular. I may be in the minority on that since others seem to really love the black. Either way, thin noodles are perfect in this soup.

Spicy tan-tan is definitely the next broth I need to try. Sansotei only makes a limited amount of tan-tan daily, and last time I was there they were sold out. Seriously a ramen place selling out of broth? That's some artisan shit right there.

Fried chicken appetizer is also on point."}
{"text":"Came here late Saturday an hour before it was about to close.  Place was about 30% full and service was quick and attentive. Noticed on their menu they have a tomato ramen $10.75 that included a scallop and one piece of pork.  Was very excited to try it out since I never had anything like this at other ramen restaurants.  It was better than I expected.  The scallop was the best part and it looked to be freshly shucked and not those small bay scallops.  The soup tasted like tomato soup with some Asian spices.  The noodles were nice and chewy.  The egg was done well with a creamy yoke.  The pork was a bit dry and flavour of it was overpowered by the soup.  Would definitely get this again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night after playing board games. I came here before and tried the tonkotsu black ramen. I really liked the garlic flavour of this dish.  Tonight, I decided to go with the Tomato ramen with thin noodles. It comes with one slice of pork, one scallop & soft boiled egg. The broth was slightly acidic due to the tomatoes. Overall, it was a pretty descent tasting dish. My Japanese friends said that this dish was not popular in Japan.  Maybe more of a fusion dish."}
{"text":"When you want a satisfying bowl of ramen noodle, come to Sansotei. The place is small and had to wait in line for about 10 mins before being seated. The menu is well-edited with six soup bases to choose from. You can select thin or thick noodles and also add other items to your ramen such as extra noodle, egg, or pork. I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen, which was a flavourful thick and rich soup base, that was delicious. My friend ordered the Miso Black which came with a different kind of thick-cut pork. His pork was more delicious than mine and I will have to remember to request it the next time I visit."}
{"text":"This Sansotei location serves delicious ramen in a cozy setting. The decor is sleek and the vibe is quite mellow compared to competing ramen chains - a good option if you want to be able to hear each other. There are some booths and some communal tables however during rush periods you might need to wait in line outside for a table. When I've waited in line, it moves pretty quick.

Once you're seated, you have some awesome ramen options. The tonkotsu ramen is creamy while the tonkotsu black has a bit more garlicky smoky flavour from the garlic oil. I come back again and again for those two - they come with a good amount of toppings like chashu, egg and mushrooms. My partner swears by both spicy tan tan and tomato ramen - although they sometimes are so popular they are sold out.

The service is fast and friendly. The food is reasonably priced (a bowl of ramen is around $12) and I always leave feeling super full - portion sizes are huge. I guess I'm not giving this place a 5 because for me personally, the ramen broth is on the salty side compared to other ramen I've tried, plus I'm deterred from coming here if the weather is bad because I hate waiting in line outside. Still though, a must-try if you're in the mood for ramen downtown!"}
{"text":"Favourite ramen spot. I was recommended to this location, as I continued to recommend others. I always order the original. So satisfying."}
{"text":"I was looking for something light and unusual and found this place (via several good YELP reviews) on my way to ROM. It was a great. Simple menu; packed-out on an early Sunday PM; very quick service; A great, unique experience."}
{"text":"I ordered the tonkotsu black for my first visit to sansotei. I didn't think that it was anything amazing though. 
I personally thought that other ramen places (santouka, kinton, etc) had more flavourful broths with more depth to the flavour. That being said, I didn't try the regular non-black tonkotsu so the comparison isn't exactly fair. 
If you're debating between the black tonkotsu vs. the black miso, definitely go with the black miso. The broth flavour of the black miso is so much better, however I didn't care for the braised pork piece that came with it because mine was all fat. :/"}
{"text":"All the other positive reviews got it right. Here's my tip for getting a seat. When you get there, look for a line on the sidewalk. If there is one, just get in the back of the line. If you go inside, they'll just send you out there. As people have said, the line does move quickly and they will skip spots in the line to fill open seats. If you're a single person you might get lucky and get in right away even if there is a line!"}
{"text":"I'm always up for trying new ramen places. I came here for lunch with my wife when we found a lot of places we wanted to try was closed on a Sunday.  It was fairly busy on a Sunday afternoon but was able to be seated in 5 mins.  Ordered the tonkatsu black. It was pretty good. Not as strong on taste as one at sho ryu ken ramen which I preferred. Fairly enough meat and the ramen came with an egg which doesn't seem to be that common in ramen places nowadays except as an add on. Also had the slow cooked wings and gyoza. Both were great. You can actually taste the freshness of the gyoza. The slow cooked wings were tender and flavorful. The place was small but not cramped. One of the things I like about ramen places is that they are fairly cozy."}
{"text":"This Ramen place is number one for me right now! 4.8/5

Spicy TanTan with extra pork belly is by far the best I've ever tasted! My boyfriend and I were craving a spicy, warm bowl of ramen and a bunch of our friends always mentioned this place!

Had to try the Chicken karaage for starters and it was OK, nothing special. It was full of flavor but the crispy texture wasn't there. 

The spicy TanTan on the other hand is out of this world!!!! Mind you this is limited throughout the day. We were so happy when they said they still had some. We added an extra pork belly! This ramen bowl is perfection! Right amount of spice, and saltiness, not over powering... The vegetables were tasty and soaked with the golden broth, the pork belly is hella tender, the eggs were cooked perfectly. I still dream about this ramen! I usually don't finish my bowl of ramen but I cleaned this bowl out!!! 

My boyfriend and I were more than happy and we still talk about this ramen!"}
{"text":"I was always craving for sansotei's ramen ever since I tried it 1 year ago. However I never had the chance to eat here again because there's always a long lineup! Finally I came back after all this wait  on a Saturday evening. It was still early so the wait wasn't that bad. I was so excited cause according to my memory their ramen was super delicious. Maybe my taste bud got picky after one year of food experience, so the ramen didn't came out as perfect as I thought. First of all, the portion was a bit small although I don't eat a lot but I still find it small. Also, the broth was a little too salty. The service was excellent though. Our server was very attentive. Overall, it's still a nice place to go for a short/small meal."}
{"text":"its great.. up to par with taste with other good ramen place.. better priced.. more toppings that other places.. decent variety. and quick (don't be scared by the line)."}
{"text":"Went to Sansotei for lunch today and had a pretty good experience. 
Firstly, even though it is a small place and we had to share a table with someone else it still had a lot of elbow room which doesn't happen with some places. I'm looking at you downtown locations of kinton ramen. I had their tonkatsu black ramen and it was very good but unfortunately I still like kinton ramen better. The amount of meat was good but I just really get there was something lacking in the flavour department. Yes it was salty enough and the noodles were good but I guess I just have a preference for kinton better. Also I really hope they decide to add larger sizes in the future or maybe more little dishes to add to their order so they can be full. If it was a day I wasn't really hungry it would've been fine, but I hadn't eaten for a while so it just wasn't enough for me."}
{"text":"I prefer coming to this Sansotei location as opposed to the one near Dundas/Bay because the lineup is significantly shorter and many times no lines at all. The quality of the food and the seating arrangement is about the same as the other location downtown. 

Usually customers are here for their ramen bowls, which is what Sansotei is known for. I like getting their Tonkotsu Black (roasted garlic oil) with thick noodle. You get 2 pieces of Chashu, some black fungus, an egg, and some green onions in the bowl. The soup is delicious and the noodles are chewy. The prices are around $10 per ramen bowl. 

There are also sides available, such as chicken wings, gyoza (fried dumplings), gyu don (beef on rice), and zangi (fried chicken bits). Typically the prices are between $4.50-$5.50. Personally I don't think the sides are worth it for the price given how small the portions are. However, if you're not craving for a large meal and just want something small, I suggest getting the Gyu Don.

For dessert, they recently introduced a mille crepe cake, which I have yet to try. I did try the green tea cheese cake before and it was really good, it was soft and creamy and with just enough matcha flavour."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Location: 4/5 

Highlight: The tonkotsu ramen broth is to die for. So creamy, rich, and flavourful, a bowl of the stuff will throw you into an instant food coma. The noodles are bouncy with no sign of sogginess in sight. 

I came here for a post-partying hangover brunch looking for something warm and rich to fulfill my craving, and I was not disappointed. For $10, I got a bowl of classic Tonkotsu ramen with thin noodles. The bowl came topped with 2 slices of gorgeously caramelized roasted pork belly, a runny soft boiled egg, and plenty of freshly sliced spring onions on top. The broth blew me away with its creaminess and depth of flavour, without being overly oily. 

The menu is simple, with about 6 different choices, and the portion size was great. There was no lineup even though the place is quite small, with mostly 2 and 4 person tables. Readers beware, the food coma is real. I had to go and take a serious nap right after this ramen."}
{"text":"I've visited Toronto twice in the past year and ate here during both visits. Also ordered the same thing on both visits: tomato ramen. For all the tomato lovers out there..try it!!! It's so good. Minus one star for portion size. I wish they give more in a bowl."}
{"text":"These guys are the Toronto kings of ramen. I've had Santouka, Kinton, Kenzo, Ajisen, Niwatei and a few others and can easily say these guys win. Especially their Spicy Tan Tan ramen. I find myself fiending for it on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Love their spicy tan tan if you can handle spice.

Great atmosphere, but they recently had a price hike so that's where the 1 star"}
{"text":"Friendly service,  food came quickly,  good prices, intimate atmosphere,  and the best Ramen in town!"}
{"text":"I live close to this location and being a huge ramen can I always visit when I have a craving. I've been visiting frequently since this location opened and the quality and service is definitely going downwards.

Depending on the day or time of you visit, the quality of food and service will vary very drastically. 

Recently, their noodles are being served with a hardness that is inedible and is definitely undercooked (not at the level of al den-ante but raw dough). I wonder if the chefs timers are broken because even when I order \"soft\" noodles, I still receive very hard noodles. Communication with the servers are difficult because they don't really speak English...this has happened three or four times now and it's very disappointing to see the second location doing so poorly."}
{"text":"Spicy tan-tan. Get it! Sooo good! 

Really I can just end my review there. Everything else that has been said about Sansotei has been described in the other reviews.

A few things I'd note about this location:
-I thought service was actually really good. Very polite.
-I was sat at a table for four even though I was there alone. I was later asked if it was ok that other people sat at the table, to which I said sure. I think more places should do this rather than make people stand and wait. Treat tables as shared benches. Let people eat!!
-There aren't that many tables here. I've heard that sometimes they ask people to wait outside the restaurant. That didn't happen when I was here, but I was told by others that could happen...so just be prepared."}
{"text":"Very tasty ramen

Delicious stock and noodles. Can't go wrong here. We like the garlic oil ramen, and the shio ramen which is sea salt based."}
{"text":"By far, the best ramen I've had.  The tonkatsu w/ garlic oil is heavenly although I would have appreciated it if it were even MORE garlicky.  It is best with thin noodles.  Also the fried chicken is a pretty good addition to your ramen as well :).  Definitely will go back again!!!"}
{"text":"Great Ramen place I ate. Very friendly servers, great atmosphere. Very traditional Ramen ."}
{"text":"Sansotei is a (very) popular ramen noodle chain that you can't go wrong with as a dining choice. There is usually a small line that forms around peak lunch/dinner times, but it doesn't take more than 10 minutes to get a table. 

The ramen soup base for the Tonkotsu / Tonkotsu Black is very thick and creamy, and I definitely prefer the Tonkotsu ramen as it's less pungent than it's oilier counterpart. I do recommend ordering extra pork slices if you're into a meatier meal, however. You can also customize the thickness/thinness of your noodles! 

The waitresses are always friendly and efficient, and your food arrives very quickly after ordering. I will always come back to eat here!

Side note: there are other ramen choices of course, but Tonkotsu + Tonkotsu Black tends to be the ramen people like the most. Definitely try one or the other if it's your first time!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best ramen places in the city. Price is reasonable, from the broth to the noodles everything is delicious. highly recommend."}
{"text":"Broth is amazing...we've had our share of ramen in Houston and can honestly say Sansotei beats them all, hands down. Highly recommend the Tonkatsu Black and Spicy Tan Tan."}
{"text":"I believe you wont find a best value ramen in town. Fast, delicious and the price is just fair! My new favourite for sure."}
{"text":"IMO probably the best ramen in toronto.
Though their noodle is factory made their recipe for the broth tastes the best in toronto.
Other than that appetizers are decent but nothing too special."}
{"text":"Wow this place is better than expected! On par with the ramen places in NYC. Had their creamy tonkatsu broth and was really creamy and had a lot of pork taste. Noodles were cooked perfectly and the pieces of pork they give with the soup was decent size. Also, fast, friendly service. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed with Toronto's ramen places in general.  For the most part I could only remember saltiness ..... And that's rather frustrating.
It was one of those cold days I would craving for ramen but I couldn't be able to enjoy the soup otherwise I would need to drink water non-stop to dilute the concentration of sodium. There is something called seasoning properly so the flavor come forward yet not abuse on seasoning to compromise everything. Ramen is one of those things seems so easy yet so complicated. I miss the beautiful broth with robust flavor, each flavor pronounced on its own , the caramelized pork belly/shoulder is tender and just melt in the mouth matching with the richness of the broth. Not having everything add into the broth the last minute kind of deal nothing would take on any flavor in depth."}
{"text":"Got the tonkotsu black (has garlic oil) with thin noodles. It was okay good. I find the Dundas location to be tastier, although this location tends to stay open later."}
{"text":"I don't think I'm a ramen connoisseur, however between this location & the one in downtown Toronto - it isn't the best. Despite subpar ramen, the highlight of this place was the interaction with staff & some observations of how this place is run.

First impression- staff needs some coaching in customer service AND team work. We were third in line to be seated. No eye contact from the girl working the front, walked away a few times without acknowledging the people waiting. Eventually she came back after a few minutes, still cold attitude. 

We grabbed seats at the bar. Usually when we go to Kinton/Santouka, I have no issue sitting at the bar. Don't do it at this location. Despite the large layout of the restaurant, the kitchen & bar is a tight squeeze. I sat closest to the kitchen, and beside me was a garbage bin that staff used to empty bowls, and the cooks to throw out scraps. Next to it was their transfer station, so there was a lot of dirty kitchenware etc. I'm not a picky diner, but they need to move that stuff elsewhere.

We placed our order & thankfully it came fast. I got the tonkatsu with thin noodles. The broth was rich but a bit oily for my liking. The noodles were a bit on the chewy side. Enjoyed the egg & black fungus. 

Halfway through our meal some of the cook staff got into an argument. There was some yelling, then one of them storm out of the kitchen & slammed the back door hard enough that we felt it 20 ft away.  All of the staff looked uncomfortable, & despite the whole restaurant witnessing this incident- it didn't seem like it was an issue for them. 

Overall, I won't be returning. The ramen was okay, the restaurant was nice but the service was variable. I was excited to see them open a Markham location but I'll be heading elsewhere."}
{"text":"This city has so many Ramen places yet many of them are so underwhelming. Not Sansotei! 

Their broths, ingredients and noodles are just amazingly getting well together making an unctuous and flavorful ramen.  

My favorite would be the Spicy Tan Tan with thick noodles. Runner up would be the Tonkotsu Black. 

They also do have a handful of good sizes, my favorite being the Zangi (deep fried chicken).

Price is also very competitive for the quality of the meal."}
{"text":"I went to Santosei way back during its soft opening.  At the time, I didn't think it was anything special.  I love Kinton and thought this place wouldn't do anything to change that.  However, after the grand opening I've heard nothing but good stuff on Yelp and other Ramen lovers I know.  I decided to go back and see for myself.  What a wonderful visit it was!!

Pros:
Great broth, best I've had in TO
Great service
Price is cheaper than the other ramen places

Cons:
So good it makes me want more??

This is now my new favourite place.  I love my Kinton as well, but Santosei has lured me away.  I had the tonkotsu black ramen.  I am a sucker for tonkotsu so if you make a good one you have me as a customer for life.  The broth was some of the best I've had in recent memory.  You have a choice of thick of thin noodle when you order.  I got the thick noodle and loved the consistency.  After broth, I believe noodles are the second most important item to a good ramen. Santosei scores excellent points from me for that as well.  Overall, a very enjoyable bowl of Ramen.

Service at these ramen places are always good and Santosei is no exception.  I've never had a bad service experience at any of the Japanese ramen shops.  They sure know how to put on great service.  The waitresses were all very polite and helpful.

I found the price overall to be cheaper than the other places.  I always add an egg, extra chashu and noodles to my ramen.  Most of the time my bill runs close to $15-17 for a bowl before taxes.  At Santosei, the egg comes with all their ramen bowls already!  With my usual extras the bill only came to about $13 before taxes.  Better ramen and cheaper prices??  WIN!!!

All in all, I'm in love with this place now.  My only gripe is I keep craving to come back!!  It's a problem I'll just have to deal with I guess.."}
{"text":"Been to the chain many times, first time at this location. Had the tonkotsu black. Excellent pork broth, great flavour with the black garlic oil, and springy noodles. With a perfectly soft-boiled egg and two hearty slices of pork, Sansotei doesn't fail to satisfy even with the smallest of menus. Service is fast and friendly, in part because I went at off-peak hours. If they toned down the salt just a smidge it would be perfect for me but I like things light. 

Overall, a great place for a bowl of delicious!"}
{"text":"Definitely up there in terms of Ramen in Toronto. The service is great and the food is delicious.
Only downside is that if you go during peak lunch hours or dinner hours expect to wait as there are usually lines out the door."}
{"text":"Had the tonkotsu black which was really flavourful. Noise level wasn't too bad and service was decent. Over the years though I feel like the portions are going down and the prices are going up! I would come back again, but $14 for a bowl is getting a little too expensive for what you get.

Good for small groups (4 or less) for sit-in dinner."}

First off, be prepared for a wait. This place is a bit on the tiny side, and if you come at peak hours, there will be a line forming. Lucky for us, we only had one other party ahead of us. And once they were seated, we anticipated our turn. 

Eventually, we were finally seated, and it was toasty in there. Small space + warm bodies + hot noodles = Turn the AC up! They also weren't too great with water refills either, so I was left sweating for the duration of our meal.

I ordered the Tonkotsu with thick noodles. I don't know why people prefer thinner noodles because ramen just calls for thick, curly noodles. My boyfriend went with the Shio with thin noodles, but he generally prefers thin noodles. We both found the ramens to be delicious. 

While the portion size is on the smaller end, I found the prices to be pretty reasonable, so it's all relative. Regardless, we didn't have to wait long for the food to feed our hungry selves, thank goodness. I would definitely come back if I'm in the area again.

Overall: 4/5
Food: 4/5
Service: 2/5
Atmosphere: 2/5"}
{"text":"One of the best Ramen in Toronto. Their shoyu is full of flavor yet very light, homie, and relaxing in comparison to the strong broth of Kinton. Also, the eggs are always perfect, solid yet flowing."}
{"text":"Kept coming back for more delicious ramen ever since the first time I've been there. Services is good and ramen always the same good quality! The seating arrangement could be optimized a bit more and perhaps not arrange seats where it's close to the door because customers could get cold especially during the winter. Overall 9.9/10 would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Service was great, fast, friendly, and helpful. I really wanted to try the spicy tantan cause it sounded so good for the cold weekend, but I found out the hard way that it gets sold fairly quickly, so next time I will have to get there earlier!

The venue was small, cute, and modern. It was very clean. Not the best place for a huge party, but the seating is plentiful, may warrant a couple minutes wait if it's high time when you arrive.

The food was great. We got the zangi, which was tender and perfectly cooked fried chicken. I got the tonkotsu ramen and it was good, but not the most amazing ever, so I enjoyed it. My partner did get the black miso and I got to try that which made me think I should've gotten the black tonkotsu for the extra flavor, next time! The extras like the egg and pork belly were tender and well cooked. 

Overall it was a great time and a great meal. Will be back for sure. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I love places like this.

Really low key, great food. Any of the ramen here is awesome. Gyoza was on point too.

I never have had Dark Asahi but it was great and fit well with the meal.

Great stuff, good to know this place is around the office."}
{"text":"While a couple of friends were in Toronto for the weekend, I decided to give them an experience in Toronto's Asian cuisine. This happened to include a trip to Sansotei Ramen, noted as being one of the best ramen houses within the city.

Inside, the room has an Asian influence with a very cozy feeling,  as there was seating for about 20 people. What tied the room together was the giant fisherman's rope hanging from the ceiling. As we sat down, the waitress was patient with us as we had no idea what we wanted at a fancy noodle joint.

All of us ended up going the safe route and chose the Shio ramen, which is a mild sea salt ramen. Within minutes, deep bowls of broth and noodles were placed in front of us. We all had trouble trying to get the noodles and broth into our mouth, but once they were it, it was like heaven. To me, it tasted like a better version of chicken noodle soup as it had more complexity while still being a simple comfort food. 

The pork belly resting on top was cooked to perfection, making it easy to bite into and savor. Similarly, the soft boiled eggs added a robust taste to the meal while still complimenting the broth surrounding it (Note to self: try more soft boiled eggs). What I found to be the most interesting was the bamboo shoots. It was hard to bite into, but the taste of them almost felt out of place as it was like biting into lettuce. The mild taste helped make the the other flavours come out while still providing an unexpected element.

Conclusion: Would replace Campbell's with this if I could afford it every time I'm sick. Therefore, I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Yummy pulled noodles. Great broth!
Portions are a touch small."}
{"text":"Went to Sansotei before the lunch rush on a Friday. We were lucky to be seated within 5 minutes, given the small place. Please be wary that the place is really small and busy! It is best to come earlier to beat the rush :)

What I ordered: 
1) Tonkotsu ramen
2) Zangi
3) Green tea cheesecake

Review:
The only other ramen place I have been to so far is Kinton, and so my knowledge of ramen is very limited, so bear with me.

1) The ramen was really great for the price. In terms of the pork, it isn't as juicy and succulent as the pork in Kinton, but it is still very good. The soup base was not too salty and the bowl came out relatively fast (faster than Kinton I would say).
2) The zangi was delicious! It was crispy and juicy (look at pictures) and served as a good appetizer for the meal.
3) The green tea cheesecake was the cherry on top of the meal! It had the powerful taste of a cheesecake with the soothing after taste of green tea. I split the cake with a friend of mine and I am pretty sure it is large enough to split among 3 people at most!

The waitress was great - she sat us and thanked us in Japanese; was extremely polite and attentive to our needs. All the servers thanked us in unison when we left the restaurant. 

Food: 4.5/5
Price: 4/5
Service: 5/5

Overall: 4.5/5

Will come again? Yes!"}
{"text":"Best ramen ever!  It would be great if you could offer take out from here.. but oh well"}
{"text":"This is a great ramen spot. Been to both locations now and very consistent across the board. The presentation here is really elegant - both the room decoration and food presentation. My black miso came with a nicely placed edible flower on the side - great touch. Seaweed salad is a healthy portion - a lot of places cheap out on that. And the Gyoza is a lot less heavy than at other places.

I think this would be a 5 star to a lot of people, but I like creamier broth, so a bit light for me. I'll be back tho to try the other ramens!"}
{"text":"Bless yourself with a reservation before walking into this place. I've gotten hit with a one hour wait time on weekends but do yourself the favor/thank me later. I ordered the black miso ramen with thin noodles but I think next time I'd get the wide noodles. The broth was creamy, smooth, and a little salty but that's how I prefer my ramen. I'm never a huge fan of chashu pork but the slices were incredibly tender and the pork flavor complimented the broth well. My nitamago (egg) had a chunk missing from the bottom of the white, sadly, but the yolk was perfectly jammy and custardy to the nth degree. Definitely a good staple for the Yonge and Bloor area."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Ramen in the city!!!  Their prices are very reasonable and cheaper than other places.  Their soup base is addicting.  There is always a line up at lunch and in the evening.  There is a reason why!  Great service as well!!!!"}
{"text":"The spicy  Dan Dan was pretty awesome.  Not u r traditional ramen but had just the right amount of heat.  The fried chicken was also tasty.  Seaweed salad was fresh n delicious as well!  Great spot especially when it's cold"}
{"text":"3.5, but easily could've been a 4 if it wasn't for the service. Had to order the goods 3 times, and it still never showed. In any case, I opted for the spicy tan tan with thin noodles, added pork belly and I wasn't dissapointed. The broth was flavourful, balanced and complex. The noodles were tasty and had great texture, but I can't say this place has left an impression on me."}
{"text":"Solid ramen. I like how their ramen is not overly salty. Also, comparing to other Toronto ramen restaurants it's generous that they give you two big slices of meat and one whole egg. My friend and I received really good service, will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"ramen is very good and so are other food offerings. been there a few times, beer was skunked once.

restaurant is small, but decor is nice.

service is spotty. I hate the feeling of being shooed out for another party."}
{"text":"Ramen is my go-to comfort food, and sansotei gives me the perfect blend of noodle and salt on my meals. The device is great, and we've only had to wait a few times while going."}
{"text":"I do not get the hype at all. I moved to Toronto end of September from NYC and absolutely needed to find the ramen place to replace my regular Totto Ramen. Sansotei was my first ramen in Toronto after extensive research of best ramen in town. I got the original to determine how good the broth is as other seasonings can to a degree hide its faults. 

It was terrible. The beginning of each bite is pleasant but it always without fail ended with an extremely salty, even bitter, tang that I was so put off. I obviously finished it because I am paying for it but it was kind of gross. I always get extra noodles and drain the broth but that absolutely did not happen here. There is zero chance they spend enough time to extract the flavor from the pork bones for the soup. I almost think they use powder and probably add some kind of heavy seasoning before serving. It seems like even from reading others reviews how the level of saltiness of two broths are different, that indicates inconsistency which can happen from adding seasoning at the end. 

Anyway, obviously not going back. Questioned the entire ramen scene in Toronto as this was found to be one of the best. I thought I would never find a good ramen here which would have been a true nightmare (before I tried Kinton) Extremely salty broth that lacks depth - like why would you ever wait to eat that shit. Dont. Its too cold."}
{"text":"When it comes to tonkotsu ramen, sansotei is definitely the best in town. The broth is rich, yet doesn't feel oily like other ramen places. The black garlic oil add-on is highly recommended and is my default goto every time I eat here

I find sansotei at this location (Yonge st) to be better than the first location on Dundas street, based on the thickness of the cha siu, and also the flavour of the broth (slightly richer tasting IMO)

The new-ish miso black ramen with spicy kakuni is also quite delicious, a few bucks more but worth every penny."}
{"text":"You know this place is good when you know that for lunch you gotta leave the office early to get there by 11:45 to get to their door before the line up is out the door!  This place has great ramen, fast service and all at a decent price!

Their new green tea cake is so heavenly - a must try!!!"}
{"text":"We loved the Ramen .. however everything else (appetizers / side dishes) we ordered were just OK . Next time we will just get Ramen. Ramen 5/5 , everything else 3/5. Good quick service."}
{"text":"The first time I had sansotei on Dundas I thought it was a whole new world. However, this time when I went to sansotei it was closer to mediocre. I may be that I've since tried better ramen places in Vancouver and Asia. The egg was the right amount of soft boiled, but it wasn't flavoured with sugar like the more high quality ramen places with egg. I got the tonkotsu black, but didn't find that the oil or garlic significantly added to the flavour. The thin noodles were cooked well. The tonkotsu which I got extra of also wasn't as well flavoured as many places I've tried. Good for Toronto but maybe not in the grand scheme of ramen"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't posted a review yet!

Sansotei ties with Santouka as the best ramen I've had in the city. Now I have never been to Japan so the only ramen I've had is in Toronto.

The tonkotsu is just a bowl of comforting yummy goodness!! I always get an extra egg instead of the pork belly. I eat pork but the pork belly in a pork broth is sometimes a little too much pork for me. 

I get a craving atleast twice a month even if it is hot outside."}
{"text":"Executive Summary: Best tasting ramen in Toronto, best price, and one of my favourite ramen's in the world (compared to NYC, LA, TO, Vancouver, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Seoul).

Value (Price/Quality): Amazing! The price per bowl with all the fixings is the best price in the world! The price is just around $10 CAD. Places in NYC and TO average $15. In Hong Kong/ Tokyo/Seoul expect +$20 CAD.

Customer Service: Good - simple. Don't expect too much as this is a quick service dining experience. 

You'll like this place if: If you love Asian goodies! Kidding, this is the best ramen in Toronto hands down. It compares to global brands such is Ippudo, Ryoji, Ichiran and better than local brands like Kenzo and Momofuko. 

Don't go here if: If you intend on making out with a hottie later that night with full on spicy or garlic breath! Or if you don't like noodles, soup, pork broth, or Asian flavours. 

Transportation: No street parking on Yonge. Nearest Green P parking is closed due to renovations. Don't park on the side streets as there are residential permits only. Lots of bike parking on Yonge and subway station is nearby.

Tip: Order the Spicy Tan Tan if you like it spicy early before they run out! Call to confirm before heading to the restaurant or opt for the Tonkotsu Regular or Tonkotsu Black.

The Good, Bad and Ugly Details: Limited seating. If possible try to eat at unpopular times. If you're a local downtown dweller, visit Monday to Thursday to never line up and eat after 8pm! Sometimes the Spicy Tan Tan runs out. Order a side of Chicken karage and opt for thick noodles to get the full richness of the noodles.

Yelp Customer Bottom Line: If you tried wonton noodles, pho, or other ramens in the city, then you must try this place. You won't be disappointed.

Business Opportunity: Allow guests to make reservations!"}
{"text":"This place is some of the best ramen in the city. 
I stopped by one Sunday afternoon with a friend and waited in line (which was a good sign). We were seated not too shortly after and ordered gyoza to start, which were juicy and hot!
I ordered the tonkotsu black and my friend the spicy tan tan. 
The egg was perfectly cooked, the broth was perfect, the thin noodles plentiful, and the chives fresh. Not too salty, and the most comforting bowl for a cold day. 
I will one hundred percent be back again."}
{"text":"Situated just south of Bloor on Yonge Sansotei at first glance seems like a cozy little Ramen-ya but my experience here was pretty underwhelmingly lukewarm.

The wait staff here are unfriendly but not in a rude or offensive way more like whoever hired the waitstaff showed up to a meet-up for antisocial/introverted Japanese people and just hired them all on the spot. It's not terrible but it does feel awkward when you're being helped by people that want nothing to do with you.

I ordered the Shoyu ramen which is topped off with 2 pieces of chashu (which I gave to my husband, cuz I don't like pork) and a soft boiled egg, bamboo shoots, and green onion. My husband ordered the Spicy Tan Tan and we both ordered extra corn and mushrooms which cost an extra 75 cents which is fine but for some reason my ramen came with a scant 7 kernels of corn and maybe 2 extra buttons of mushroom???  

I don't savour the fact that Sansotei serves ONLY PORK based broths... I get it, ramen is classically based on a pork broth but hey not everyone is a fan of consuming pork and here's one great reason why  https://youtu.be/_KrW6AKWMT0

The noodles I ordered were of the thicker variety but they were disappointingly short and had an undesirable al dente texture which took away from the whole slurping experience I mean, if you're not able to slurp your Ramen what's the point of having ramen to begin with ¯\_(?)_/¯

The one highlight of the whole experience was the Crêpe Cake which is outsourced by the amazing Millie Crêperie of course. 

In summation,  if you like pork based broth and if you like being served by waitstaff who act like they're afraid to talk to people then Sansotei on Yonge is your type of Ramen place otherwise I'm going to have to give it a 2 out of 5"}
{"text":"Compared to the original Dundas location - the waitresses aren't as nice and the pork isn't as tender but there are no line ups. Overall, it's still amazing ramen and is well worth it if you're in the Bloor & Yonge area."}
{"text":"I don't get to eat ramen (the non instant kind) very often, so when we were in the area, headed straight to Sansotei. Ordered the Tonkotsu black with thick noodles. Every thing was very good, from the noodles to soup base and all the toppings, however there could have been a little more pork belly, so will probably get extra next time. The price is a little high in my opinion but I would come back as it is one of the best I've had in Toronto. The service was also very friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5

Ramen is not my area of expertise, meaning I've only had it half a dozen times. But the ramen here was good.

The menu is very small and unvaried, basically there are a few different broths with essentially the same ingredients (perhaps this is why I struggle to get excited about ramen?)

 I had the tonkatsu. Very salty but delicious. Portion is big but you'll mostly be filling up on noodles. 

Ambiance is quite non-existent here, it has more of a quick lunch time place vibe vs a fun night out. Service was really good. Thought it was a bit steep paying $15 for a bowl of ramen and tea (they charge $2 for the tea)."}
{"text":"quality is consistent. not as salty as the other ramen places. good service."}
{"text":"A very good 4.7!!

A quiet place with no line-up (let's pray for it doesn't close soon because of underperforming...) for a ramen... very courteous and nice staff. 

Ramen (especially the Tonkatsu black) is really good, but like the other Sansotei, the characteristic is that the broth is one the creamiest of all ramen places in Toronto. Not greasy like my first experience at the Dundas location, where I never got back (because it was really too creamy-greasy). So you'll still know hours later that you've been there... but anyhow, it was good and I will return to this one!

The final touch is the nice, not-too-loud Japanese pop music they play. Had fun listening to it!"}
{"text":"Love their soup base!!
I always get the thick noodles because they stay Al dente longer;)! In the summer don't worry, they have AC!"}
{"text":"omg absolutely love this place! i seem to go here often with my friend whenever i'm in town visiting toronto. my favourite item is the tonkotsu black. i think i've also had the mochi dessert here (not on my recent visit, but i'm pretty sure i've had it before) - which, if i recall correctly, is light and not too sweet. this place gets busy really busy sometimes though! so if you're not prepared for a long wait, come during off-hours!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I'm generally not a huge fan of going out to a restaurant to order broth or a soup-type dish. But, I'll go out to Sansotei ANY DAY. The ramen here is simply amazing. Their broth is rich and satisfying, and the noodles are delicious. My favourite dish at Sansotei is Tonkotsu with thin noodles. The egg is creamy and I love the fungus in the soup. The fungus is crunchy and adds some texture to the ramen. My second favourite dish is the Spicy Tan Tan, which has ground pork. Although it can be quite spicy, the spice isn't overwhelming.

None of the ramen disappoints. I've tried almost all of the soups on the menu, and they're all incredible. You really can't go wrong. However, I would recommend sticking with the soup and foregoing the dumplings. They aren't anything to write home about. 

The service here is always excellent as well. The servers are attentive and accommodating, given the long line ups."}
{"text":"I had no idea they opened up a second location so by chance when I saw this little shop, I knew I had to dine here.  

Menu is small, and you have your choice of thin or thick noodles. Makes ordering easy for someone as indecisive as I am. Chose the tomato ramen because 1. I've never had it before and 2. It comes with scallop! The ramen came out really quick. Almost too quick. But the broth was nice. The bowl was a bit smaller than I remember but it was the perfect amount for me personally. The egg was cooked perfectly, and you get a whole egg unlike it's competitors. The tomato ramen comes with a nice full scallop (which I saved for last), and juicy little mushrooms. One thin slice of pork was the only complaint I had. Skimped out on the meat. 

Decor is minimalist but very clean. The servers were extremely friendly. They repeat the order back to you so there's no confusion and greet you when you go in and out the main doors. Great spot to get your ramen fix."}
{"text":"This location of Sansotei is the lesser known one so it has less line up (even on a sunday evening) but with the great ramen soup-base that sansotei is known for. Although we were a group of 7, we were able to be seated quickly and our large amount of order was taken. Most of us tried the black garlic oil one and we got starters of the spicy wings, chicken kaarage, and  gyoza. The spicy wings are not a part of their online menu and tasted very chinese, so i'm guessing it was a decision made by that particular location. The wings were surprisingly good though. The chicken kaarage wasn't that cripy but was good, and the gyoza was just mediocre.

The soup and noodle is what makes the place rock. I would recommend the thick noodle over the thin and the garlic oil soup is worthy to be drunk fully. I also recommend a bit of corn to be added as a topping to add some sweetness.

Can't wait until the Markham locations opens!!!"}
{"text":"Give me a bowl of perfectly flavoured broth with yummy ramen noodle, complete with pork belly and soft-boiled eggs and I'm a fan. This new location is a lot like the original one on dundas, but with one plus: they have a deal for $12 for any ramen + bottle of sapporo. Steal! The Sapporo would normally be $6.50, so you save about $3 on this combo!

I always get the Tonkatsu Black with extra pork belly, and it was just as good here as Dundas....and I'm a bit convinced the bowls are bigger too. Will be returning again!"}
{"text":"Good bowl of ramen and pork, but portion could have been three bites bigger to leave me feeling satiated instead of slightly hungry. Egg is on the smallish side.  Bowl lacks a sense of physical depth I expected to perceive.  My fellow diners believe another local competitor's ramen tastes better, but I know no different because I haven't made it my expertise.  

Bathrooms are not accessible to persons with disabilities."}
{"text":"This is a rich, satisfying bowl of soup. I enjoyed the tonkotsu with garlic oil a few weeks ago for lunch. The broth was flavourful and the noodles had the right texture. I especially liked the addition of black mushrooms. However, the broth had unexplained crunchy bits floating in it which I was confused by.

My wife's spicy tan tan with ground pork was good too, although a little thinner.

We walked in without a line, unlike the constant line downtown. Recommended."}
{"text":"Food is cheap and delicious, great quality. I would recommend for anyone looking for a delicious ramen spot. Fast service, polite and attentive servers."}
{"text":"I don't normally give 5 stars out, but I haven't had better. This place is great!

The Spicy Tan Tan has just the right amount of spice. Not overpowering, yet an enjoyable level of spice. The pork shoulder was done just right and the cut was ideal. The egg was exactly perfectly medium. I ordered mine with the thick noodle; however, I would suggest ordering this dish with the thin noodle.

I also had the deep fried chicken starter which was also delicious.

I would definitely return to this location. Especially once they receive their LLBO :P"}
{"text":"I got seaweed salad, black tonkotsu with thick noodles, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and and extra egg. I also had a couple of Sapporos and some hot tea. The meal was fantastic. It came out quickly, was very reasonably priced, and tasted great. The place is not very big and easy to miss from the street, but it was quite nice on the inside. I was seated almost immediately and the service was very responsive. I would definitely recommend this place for ramen."}
{"text":"???????????????BBQ pork????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????cp???????5??"}
{"text":"I went to the dundas street location but closed for easter monday. So, I went to new location.  Yes. I will be back , when I am in toronto. This place remind me delicious ramen places in east village nyc.
Also I love to eat ramen on the street of tokyo after I drink n drunk. Miso broth may be different the way chef prepare. You try and find out that, thats your taste or not.
I like their  spicy tan2 ramen with extra cha shu. Little salty.
Miso remen is also good but not my type. I like thin noddle better than thick one.
Yes. Nama ramen ( fresh noodle)++++.
So far so good. Check it out. Cant find place to tag photos. Ty"}
{"text":"On a dreary, rainy Thursday what better way is there to chase away the blues than with a nice steamy bowl of ramen! Sansotei has a good selection of ramens (lacking in vegetarian options however) that are priced right and taste delicious. 

We ordered goyuza and seaweed salad, both tasty additions to the meal. Friendly and efficient staff and although we went at prime time lunch hours we got a table no problem (although we were asked to share it with a solo diner which was a-ok by me!)

Would definitely return if I'm in the neighborhood again!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to ramen spots in the city and I'm unfortunate to work relatively close by so ordering a bowl of their spicy tan tan noodles was never an issue. 

Service is always on point  where they are always attentive the only down side I can think of is the limited seating. If you're going with a huge party you may be out of luck but it's Toronto, we love to wait in line for yummy food."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for the past 2 years and never been disappointed. I was on the hunt for a good bowl of ramen ever since travelling to Japan and I have to say this is the closest I have come to finding it in Toronto. The spicy tan tan is great however you have to come early before it runs out. When I've come late my second choice is the Tankotsu black which is topped with a roasted garlic oil and very flavourful. The gyozas are also very tasty!"}
{"text":"Really legit ramen lives here. The ramen, pork, broth, all work together perfectly for me. Service was excellent too. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Sansotei has been on my Yelp bookmark ever since I started making my Toronto itinerary. You could easily walk past this place if you weren't looking. There isn't any big signs on the exterior of the restaurant. 

The place is small. There's a giant rope that hangs across the ceiling, maybe to represent ramen?There are wooden tables and booths that seat 2-4 people. This place is not good for big groups. 

We were seated right away. The menu is simple and basic. The waitress brought us water with lemon, with only one ice cube! I ordered the Tonkotsu, $9.60, with thick noodles. The food came out fairly quickly. The broth was delicious! The noodles were al dente, I would have preferred it to be a little bit softer. The pieces of pork were huge and the egg was runny, perfection! 

The bathroom is in the back of the restaurant near the kitchen down the stairs. There are 2 stalls. It is very clean and modern. 

I would definitely come back to Sansotei!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I know a lot of people who loves this place. For me their soup base is just way too salty, I understand my palate is a little bland sometimes. However when I asked my friend who normally eats very salty foods, she even found it salty. It burned our tongues. This is just my personal take on it."}
{"text":"We had a little trouble finding the place as the street numbers don't really match up on Yonge Street looking across the street. It was so nice that when I called for help in directions she stood out to wave us over. We were seated right away and since I had ramen recently I decided to go with side dishes, so I got the seaweed salad, gyu don, and the spicy slow cooked wings. They were all very flavorful and tasty. I also tried my mom's tomato and my dad's tonkatsu black ramen and they were awesome! I actually regretted not getting the ramen. That tomato is so unique in flavor and so delicious. The prices were reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Crappy.  Don't bother.  Small place but can get loud.  Only serve pork in the ramen and the pork smells funny. Every breath I take I get that smell.  Makes me wanna puke.  Super suspicious that they don't have any other meat available.  Noodles taste kind of old. Overall don't bother. There are so many better options along the street. Also they charge for tea (wtf)  and don't have sake"}
{"text":"I can never get enough of the black garlic ramen - tonkastu black.  It has a creamy broth with a perfect noodle texture. A very satisfying meal in the winter and summer.  It's a small ramen house and can be quite warm inside.  Expect line ups outside throughout the day. Come with a small group, less than 4, to ensure you get seated quicker."}
