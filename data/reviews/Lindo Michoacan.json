{"text":"As close as I have ever gotten to \"authentic\" Mexican food. I was expecting the same ol canned beans and flavored food, but it was almost as goods as my mother home cooking! Of course no one can ever beat moms haha. Hard to empress a Mexican with restaurant style food, but this place did it indeed! Will be back"}
{"text":"The best . Music and great food what more can you ask for? Great service yep they have that to."}
{"text":"Impeccable service, but it almost seemed like there was at least one person hovering around our table. We had the guacamole that was made fresh at our table, and it was really good.  My husband had the carnitas, and he enjoyed his meal. I had the combo plate with a beef taco and a cheese enchilada. The beef taco was okay, but very greasy. The enchilada was a disaster - congealed cheese - and tasted bad."}
{"text":"The staff was super attentive. Food was yummy...more tex-mex like. The view was awesome! You could see the whole valley. I went for lunch with my family and it was pretty quiet compared to the weekend (according to my Mom), but it was a Wednesday afternoon and we were looking for something good! It really seems like it would be a fun nighttime bar/food spot....I'll definitely visit when I'm in town again! BTW the margaritas looked awesome....alas I didn't try one."}
{"text":"Ngah. I wish the food was as good as the view. If you enjoy alcohol with your meal, you'll probably get tipsy enough to gloss over how mediocre the food is. And if you're fine with sloshing hot sauce on the main dish then you're probably not very picky about whether the meat tastes gamey or the tortillas greasy. Maybe we got unlucky, or maybe we ordered the wrong things, but I ate at the DI location about a decade ago and remember it tasting equally disappointing.  Servers were friendly and helpful, even while comping half of our meal; chips and bean dip were above average, but so too were all the prices. Water was clean tasting if you care about that sort of thing. View is fantastic. And I really disliked the food.  We would love to find just one meal here that works for our cursed picky-eater super-taster palates, so we'd have an excuse to come by and enjoy the view and friendly service. Who knows what it'll take to come back, though."}
{"text":"Lively place, Nice view of city. Server, busser , Excellent. Nachos disappointing, came Out Well Done and looked Less Than appetizing. Pork entree was good, my wifes Vegetarian enchiladas were Average. Lots of Food for the price ."}
{"text":"The food is very authentic gourmet mexican...pretty vast menu and we ordered the carnitas and the birria lamb stew  The mango cake and the mexican style donuts we absolutely amazing!   It was very busy busy the staff was very quick and were nice keeping our drinks coming!   It also has an amazing high valley view of the las vegas strip!   Its like going to Baja!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant,  by far. We've been coming here for years.  Always fresh food and terrific service. Well,  unless you get the one \"grumpy\" waitress. We usually see her in during breakfast. Never smiles and seems to be upset she has to help us. This is not a one time \"Maybe she was having a bad day\" thing. She's always grumpy to us. This should not stop anyone from going here. Every other employee here is super nice and friendly. That's the only reason Grumpy is so noticeable. Who knows?  Maybe she just doesn't like the look of my face! Plus, you have to try the food here. The soups are amazing. Not just the small cup of fideo soup they bring before the entr√©e,  the dinner soups are the best. In fact, our family has never had a bad meal. Every time we go,  whatever we order is fantastic. The dining area and Restrooms are always clean. They even have live music. For an even better experience, try the table side guacamole or the flaming ice cream dessert. That's right, \"flaming!\"  To sum up: One grumpy apple does not spoil the bunch. This outstanding restaurant gets Five well deserved stars!"}
{"text":"UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE: Since I worte my last review of thi splace, I hace since gone back. I went this past Labor day weekend for lunch. I am so very very disappointed. The menu prices have gone up so much. Lunch and dinner used to be a decent price, now they have gone up nearly 2 bucks for each entree. They also used to include a small bowl of soup with lunch, now it is 4.95 for it!!!! On top of all this, they provide only ONE refill of your beverage at lunch. So sad that the owners seem to have gotten very greedy and began to overprice. Despite this being one of my favorite Mexican resturants of all time, the price, quality and greed will not allow me to go back. I will look for something new.  You may never find another Mexican food resturant like this. WOW WOW WOW!!!!!  The food, awsome, the service, awsome, the price, awsome.  This family has done so well, and knows how to treat a customer!"}
{"text":"Great place with a great view! Service was good and so was the food. Portions are huge so go hungry or plan on taking home the left overs."}
{"text":"I have made two trips to this restaurant. The first visit was at about 4:30 in the afternoon and although the service was FANTASTIC, the food was good, but nothing memorable. However, we decided to go back for a family member's birthday party and this time the food was AMAZING. Also the views of the entire valley at nighttime are to die for. However, I will agree that later in the evening, customers are packed in there like sardines. However, the coma you will be put in by the most authentic tortillas I've had this side of the border will make you forget about everyone around you. Can't wait to get back to Lindo Michoacan!"}
{"text":"Received great service for my entire family, loved the atmosphere and the staff. They were very attentive and the drinks and food were delicious. Definitely will come back next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Second time coming to this location , this time the food was really good taste and look was great !!  Most important the staff was very very friendly and fast , over all my visit here was great time !!!  Recommend getting Green chilaquiles with egg or the Pollo con Crema de rajas !!! So good"}
{"text":"So impressed with this place. Dinner was so good the first visit that my husband and I came back the next morning for breakfast. Visited again recently, and everything was perfect from the food to the service. It's not often you find restaurants like this one, highly HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! :)"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! A friend and I were in town for a conference and tired of the strip. We checked online for the best mexican food, and found this place. From the strip, it was about a 15 minute drive, but sooooo worth it!!!  Well, to start off with, they bring out yummy chips, salsa, and beans. We ordered aguas de Jamaica and it was delish! Our glasses were constantly refilled, and we felt attended to.   I couldn't decide on the plethora of choices, but finally decided on the fish tacos, which were fabulous. Nice homeade corn tortillas and a generous portion of crunchy fish pieces, and thick slices of avocado.They came with a delicious sauce on the side, and also the lettuce came on the side of the plate, so it was nice to add however much I wanted of each.  My buddy was also indecisive, but by suggestion of the waiter ordered the Pollo Sarandeado, and she absolutely loved the flavoring. She had previously lived in Mexico and missed the authentic food, but this food really did it for her. She also commented it was probably the best chicken she ever had!  To finish off the meal, we had sopapillas. Deeeelicious!"}
{"text":"I didn't need to eat here to give it at least 3 stars because when I walked in I was woo'ed with the views.  As long as they had a good margarita and chips and salsa I was in!  Food was amazing, entire strip view was incredible, margaritas were tasty, chips were perfect, salsa was superb, and the staff was outstanding (that being said after both of my kids spilled a drink on the carpeted floor)."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here several times, the food was usually good.  However, today we had lunch there and it was unimpressive.  I ordered the carne asada plate and my wife ordered the carne asada tacos.  The carne asad did not have any seasoning.  My guess is that the pre cook it and store it in water then grill it when they need to serve it.  When you bite into the meat it appears to be water logged and has absolutely no taste.  We were very disapointed."}
{"text":"This local chain is exceptional!  Great homemade tortillas, margaritas, and salsa.  Erica at the bar is precious!"}
{"text":"The shrimp aguachiles was a complete disappointment !! Sauce was gross, I might as well grabbed cilantro and shoved it down my throat , it was prepared with white onion ?? Aguachile is typically with purple onion ?? And is meant to be a little spicy !!"}
{"text":"Great view !!! Service was good with great accommodations for my infant son !! Great happy hour !! Will be back !!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here every time I visit.  Everything tastes very clean and the table side guacamole is great.  I took my parents while they visited town and they loved the view.  My mother is handicapped and the wait staff actually helped her walk thru the restaurant and down the stair to her seat and helped her again as we left.  It was extremely sweet of them to do that.  Dad usually does that but they insisted on helping. The view is great as well.  I made sure to make a reservation (called that morning) to request a table with a view.  It was a weeknight so there were fewer diners than peak times and that probably helped.  I love the food and am always satisfied every visit."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance, the view, the food, the attentiveness of the staff. Looking forward to the Mariachi!"}
{"text":"Great location, although parking can be a hassle. Awesome view even if you're not close to the windows.  It's a big open restaurant that gets loud on a busy night, but I'm okay with laughing and singing at a restaurant.  Live music mariachi band. Bartender making awesome house margaritas and other specialty drinks. Waiters are knowledgable about the menu and always have great suggestions. Each waiter has helpers (Nacho is the best!) that refill drinks and help serve. This means I'm always taken care of.  The food is great, big portions, flavorful and lots to choose from. You start off with a bowl of refried  beans, salsa and chips as soon as you sit down. They are quick to refill these items! My house margarita on the rocks was perfect balance of tequila and sour. Most meals come with a side of refried beans, rice and salad. Best dishes are Camerones Abuelito (bacon wrapped shrimp) and my favorite Camerones Tia Esther , a blend of spices and cream. Order the freshly made at the table guacamole!"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant.  The food is always good.  The salsa is nice and spicy and the service is fast and attentive.  It's a great place to take my entire family.  I usually order the chicken fajitas, which are amazing.  I also love that they serve a complimentary bowl of soup with the standard chips and salsa.  Nice touch! The kids love it."}
{"text":"This restaurant was beyond amazing!!  The service and, the ambience was unsurpassed!!!  The food was delicious and very authentic which is hard to find in Vegas.  We are a Mexican family so we definitely appreciated the amazing food.  We had a very large group of 22 people and were celebrating two birthdays.  Noe, the manager greeted us once we arrived and made sure that we were taken care.  Our waiters, Christian and Angel were extremely attentive and their service was efficient and prompt. To celebrate my nieces birthday, the mariachis serenaded my niece with a couple of songs, and the servers also came to sing happy birthday and gave her a special birthday drink.  I can not say more about this restaurant, it was just such a memorable experience for our family!  I'm just sad that there aren't any Lindo Michoacan's in Los Angeles.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas and go back to Lindo Michoacan! :)"}
{"text":"Our best meal during 3.5 days in Las Vegas!  Atmosphere, service and food were all fantastic when our group of 5 visited last Thursday.    I could tell it was going to be a delicious dinner when the chips and salsa came out.  Also, the bean dip served with the chips was wonderful.  Not sure if this is a local thing, but bean dip is not typically served automatically at our Mexican restaurants.  We also ordered guacamole and the shrimp ceviche, and after the appetizers I was so full I could have skipped dinner.  But I didn't.  I had the carnitas coca cola, which was a nice twist on a pork entree.  The marinade was just slightly sweeter than I prefer, but it was very good.  Entree portions are huge - my boyfriend and I wished we had split because neither of us finished our dinners.  Friends ordered the goat stew, steak with green chiles and another order of the carnitas specialty and everyone loved their meals.  We filled the table with food and drinks, everyone left full and the best part of all was the total for the meal was about half what we spent on other dinners in Las Vegas.  We didn't know about the free shuttle to and from the Strip, so we came in a cab and then used the shuttle to go back to our hotel.  What a great bonus to an already wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. I can't believe people actually complain about something they receive for free. The chips, salsa and beans which are completely free and unlimited are delicious. We have tried almost everything on the menu. They are batting 90% on the great/good side. Not crazy about their red enchilada sauce but everything else is the bomb. This place is second to none in Henderson/ Las Vegas metro. Possible THE best tacos I've ever had. Their salsa is 80% pure blended chili with garlic and onions added. It has a perfect balance and is hot. If you don't like hot food maybe stick to your regular bland diet but Mexican food is traditionally hot. 5 stars on their table side guacamole and their margaritas rock. You can NOT beat the view of the city. Ask your hostess to seat you in the glass view room and try to catch the city lights after dark."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, but the quality of the food is just not the same. Sad, but I'll be searching for a new Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I was here for a work dinner and overall, the place is solid.  The chips and table side guacamole were great.  The drinks were a little weak. I ordered the coke carnitas and was a little disappointed.  It didn't have a lot of favor.  Other people enjoyed their dinners.  Next time, I'll have to make a better selection.  We didn't have room for dessert because we all ate too many chips -- they're that good.  The service was very good. My water and my drink were never empty.  And everyone was super nice.  Definitely deserves a repeat visit when I'm in LV again."}
{"text":"There sauces compliment the food, where most places use sauce to cover up the food. The service is bar none! Everyone is so helpful and sincere. The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had! By far the best mexican food i have EVER had! Btw, free shuttle service to and from the strip!"}
{"text":"This place leaves A LOT to be desired! I would only go here for drinks & the spectacular view! As far as authentic Mexican food, it's terrible, and I'm Mexican! It all tastes frozen & microwaved, the service is terrible. When I want authentic Mexican, I go to the original Lindo's on Desert Inn & Eastern or Bonito Michoacan on Decatur & Twain. I will never waste my money here again!"}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner on 2/15.  Everything started out fantastic, excellent view great appetizers.  Had 2 chicken burrito's with red sauce, one chicken enchilada and one chili verde burrito. Three of us who ate the burrito's ended up sick for a week.  Not sure if left overs from the Valentine's Day crowd.  I read the reviews but not likely to return or if we do will partake in drinks and appetizers only."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. Didn't have any expectations. I ordered the Carne asada salad and it was really good. Another dish my boyfriend got was the pollo con reja creme (excuse the spelling. I'm not too sure if I spelled it right in spanish). My boyfriend said it was the best chicken dish he has ever had. I would definitely go here again when I am in town!"}
{"text":"Love the Place. Awesome Drinks, Great Food, and an Amazing View.."}
{"text":"I would only return for the atmosphere, entertainment, drinks, nice people.  Its gorgeous, I just wished the food matched up as well as the service being on point with how pricey it is.  Waiter was pleasant but was not attentive as we would like.  I blame management for not staffing well for the customer turnout.  I have had food much less expensive tasting so much better...so it was a real disappointment.  Portions was fine but everything was bland.  There also wasn't flexibility to customizing the plate of food you wanted as there was for seating.  Please put flavor, real mexican flavor in the food! not enough parking."}
{"text":"Friendly folks, nice booth for the 3 of us. Howevr we all agreed that while our meals were properly prepaired, the chef forgot to season anything. Dips were even dull, and I'd thought that was an impossibility."}
{"text":"The cashier, who's name I believe is Nayeli.. was rude & was talking to her friends when I was trying to communicate with her about my food order. Very unprofessional, I have never felt so ignored. But the food was excellent as always.  I love their Pollo Sarandeado & fresh guacamole dip!"}
{"text":"Tried this place again recently, and I agree with other reviewers, the service and ambience is pretty good, but the food is only okay. I ordered two chicken tacos. All of the food we have had here has only been okay, it never stands out."}
{"text":"This was the worst mexican food I have had in Vegas to date. Chicken taco had no flavor, Enchiladas were unbelievably disgusting, I honestly do not understand how this place gets so many good reviews. Nothing mexican gourmet about this place other than the decor!"}
{"text":"It is always a pleasant experience eating here. The carnitas are amazing, the service is excellent, and I highly recommend the guacamole. A definite must whenever I visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food we have had anywhere(including Mexico). The queso fundido is fantastic! Flour and corn tortillas are fresh and the dishes we tried were good. Service was excellent. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"First off this place has an outstanding view of the valley at night which to me, was better than the food. Our party (5 of us) pulled in around 8:00 tonight, quickly seated and the staff and service is 5 stars, I cant say enough how well the service operates here it flows very efficiently we didn't have to ask for anything. The food was ok, I was hoping for more flavor . The bean dip was pretty good, the salsa wasn't super, it wasn't hot enough and was a little bland, we asked for some hotter and it came out and yes it was hotter but lacked some flavor behind the heat, the chips I thought were a little too cooked, I've had better chips and salsa elsewhere. Main course comes out and like I said it was ok, nothing special, nothing stood out, almost like the chef has no passion or is told to not spice anything up. It came out within 15 mins and was nice and hot. All in all, we would go back for drinks I suppose and for the view, but until their food matches the rest of the establishment I probably wont eat here again. It's a shame because its a beautiful location, well staffed, upscale authentic sort of vibe, but the food just falls short of expectations.  I have to say this again though, the staff, servers, waiters, are all superior. Excellent service here. Just please get a real chef with passion or do something to fix the bland issue  , that food might pass off as awesome to some of the less traveled/versed public, but I expected better.  Oh yes people in our party said the margaritas were muy bueno, and strong hehe.  On another note, I ordered the a supposed overnight marinated chicken dish in a red sauce. Ok, now its the only dish under chicken that says it is marinated overnight in special seasoning or what have you....Ok, if it was marinated overnight it was marinated in salt water and that's it. It definitely didn't taste like it had a good marinade soak it was tender and juicy but had minimal flavor. So, Lindo, fix that or rephrase that menu item because I'm fairly certain that wasn't marinated at all. About 97.5% sure that it wasn't."}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying the service here is excellent, the staff is very attentive at all times during the meal and their guacamole service before the meal was very tasty.  One person in our party enjoyed their steak entree, and it was very good but the chicken fajitas were bland, and the chile verde could have been better, they lacked flavor and heat terribly. The red salsa which they bring out had flavor and some heat to it, the green salsa did not.  We expected awesome Mexican food here based on reviews and awards but that wasn't the case with our visit.  Gone are the days of the old El Cholo Mexican Cafe on Las Vegas Blvd, and the killer food they used to serve consistently, it seems that nowadays Mexican food in Vegas is watered down, lacks the heat flavor and substance of the old ghosts of this town. I don't want a fusion of some pretentious looking spread when I go for Mexican food, I want flavor, heat, and authentic recipe's and Vegas just lacks that in the culinary genre."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner here at Lindo Michoacan, it was fabulous. Just about the best Mexican restaurant in the valley. Had the Pipian, which is tongue in a special kind of Mol√© sauce, damn delicious. Order the drably made, table side made guacamole, it's definitely worth it. Plus the view from the bar is spectacular. Will come back again soon."}
{"text":"Anytime I don't feel like cooking, or If I have company I usually come here for good authentic mexican food. The Cocteles are AWESOME! (its the usual for me) but I always make the mistake of stuffing my face with there chips and salsa (its sooo good!). Everyone who I have taken here or the other locations have never complained. If you want good mexican food in a nice location I would say this is the place!"}
{"text":"The food here is always 5 stars, but the service has been less than desirable the last few visits.  Margaritas are yummy in my tummy!  The fresh guacamole is the perfect start, with extra lime juice for me please.  I always get the garlic chicken mole', absolutely amazing 7 times and counting.  I wanted to try something different so I went with the steak fajitas and I might have a new favorite!  Did I mention they have one of the best view in Vegas with glass windows that make the best sunset setting.  We watched the fireworks there this past July 4th and it was great."}
{"text":"Decent, but not great mexican food. Nice outdoor seating when not windy.   Very CLEAN bathroom!   The food is decent, but kinda bland..definitely not as good as cantina laredo in tivoli. Maybe it's my gringo taste? Who knows."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food! We had a very nice dinner(chicken and steak fajitas) and the servers were attentive without being bothersome. The nicest part was the complimentary ride back to our hotel in the restaurant's Honda Scion. That saved us a $25 cab fare! This is a must for people looking to eat good Mexican and get away from all the over-priced casino/hotel restaurants!"}
{"text":"Lighting is frustratingly dim which just makes me suspicious - what are they hiding? Prices are ridiculously high for food I could have prepared better. And, I ordered the frozen mango margarita and there just couldn't have been any alcohol in it. Can't recommend the place."}
{"text":"The service is always quick, the staff is amazing and the food is by far the best in Vegas. Wish they would move a location to SoCal."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. All around its just a great place to eat and relax. They even have a view of the strip which is beautifully lit up at night. Very clean too."}
{"text":"I have been scarfing down Lindo Michoacan's fresh tortilla chips and salsa since I was 10.  My Mom, on advice of a fellow ER Doctor, dragged my Father and I one day to Lindo .. back then, it was a tiny, one room restaurant.  Quaint, warm and the food was as authentic as one could get in Mexico.  We were thrilled.  As a family, we frequented Mexico quite often, so finding a proper Mexican restaurant off the Strip was a highlight back in the day.  Flash forward to present day, where Lindo has now expanded to a 4 room, plus bar, famous and popular restaurant.  My Dad has since become great friends with the owner, even traveling to Europe with Javier.    The food is what is most impressive with Lindo's history.  The quality has perfectly remained the same.  An older Mexican woman still stands in the middle of the restaurant, hand rolling out tortillas and frying them before your eyes.  The chips, pico de gallo and fresh table side guacamole is still amazing.  Everything on the menu is authentic .. the recipes are from inland Mexico .. this is not your \"Mexican Americano\" menu, but instead, true Michoac√°n fare.  After traveling all throughout Mexico frequently, and living in Mexican restaurant laden San Francisco and Southern California, Lindo Michoacan is still, by far, my favorite Mexican restaurant.  Now that I have moved from my hometown of Las Vegas, it is a priority that we dine at Lindo Michoacan each visit.  Although I am not entering that same quaint and unknown restaurant, once I taste the food, the memory of sitting there as a 10 year old comes rushing right back."}
{"text":"We used to go to Viva Michoacan and loved it and started out or evening trying to go there only to find out they were closed. So we decided to go to this one. Our last time here was ehh, but we decided to give it another chance especially because we were craving good mexican. This however was far from good mexican. My husband ordered the filet relleno and said it tasted like mayo and was disgusted by the chile relleno. I had the fajitas and they only came with two tortillas and were quite bland and over cooked and just tasted like cheap beef. At Viva these dishes were delicious but here they're far from. The ambiance was terrible as well. Viva would always have these great musicians singing and playing guitar but you could still have a conversation. This place was loud the musician was singing to a synthesizer that was terrible and so loud.  It was just painful.On top of the acoustics are so terrible in this location, even without the horrible music its still super loud. We won't be back and we're sad to lose one of our favorite mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Ate here based on a friends recommendation and I'm so glad I did.I enjoyed everything I was served,from their fresh chips and salsa to the complimentary fideo soup (I'm usually not very big on soups,but it was so good I devoured it in a matter of seconds).I ordered the carnitas and it was delicious and their service was fantastic! I think I found my new favorite Mexican restaurant.I just wish it wasn't 2 1/2 hours away."}
{"text":"First time visiting and I experienced excellent customer service and delicious food. The margaritas and micheladas are very good."}
{"text":"Delicious food!! Great Service with friendly staff!! Amazing Margarita's!! Fun Atmosphere!! Clean and Quaint!!"}
{"text":"I've been there many times and the food never disappoints.  I will, however, never go back on a Friday or Saturday night.  It is so loud you cannot have a conversation."}
{"text":"Gerardo es el mejor! Excellent service and the bean dip is fantastic and free! Very clean too and cool uniforms."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service, expansive menu and a guy with a whistle. How could Mexican get any better? Yummy margaritas, that's how. Best Mexican food in Vegas. Period."}
{"text":"Not the best mexican food I've ever had but so far for Vegas this is the spot..   Our 1st experience was for dinner over a year ago & our 2nd experience was about a month ago for lunch. 2nd experience much better than 1st..lol.  Personally I think the dinner menu is too big of portions for me & not enough items I like.. It was evening so atmosphere was very dark, also very loud & crowded.. We were in a both by a 20 top..lol. Couldn't even here ourselves talk to each other..  but that's okay.. thats what type of ambiance goes with authentic Mexican joints :) food was so so.. My husband found musclely stringy tendon type meat in his beef.. & was pretty grossed out to say the least.   Buuuuuut we have recently went back for lunch.. just randomly stopped in. And it was amazing! food was fresh, service was great & lunch menu was just right for me   We LOVE their hot suace they give you with chips. We love how spicy it is.    FYI they charge for refills.. meals come with a drink & one refill.."}
{"text":"We had the best service, great food and a wonderful view. We both ordered a chicken entree and it was PLENTY OF FOOD! My husband had a margarita - he said it was GREAT. Ended the night with and order of churros! We will be returning if we ever find ourselves in Henderson again!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite location of my favorite Mexican restaurant! The food here, like every Lindo is Amazing!!! Like seriously it's so tasty! I believe all of their locations are family owned, and that shows in the quality of the food. Everything feels very homemade, especially the tortillas which you can watch them make through a window. The views from this location are breathtaking! It was a huge glass wall with incredible views of the strip. You will need to make a reservation if you want a table with a view, however, as I've been here countless times and only had a view the one time I made a reservation. The staff here is always curious and I like the music here, they always have musicians, but they aren't too loud or distracting like at some other Lindo locations I've been to. All in all, I would recommend this restaurant, and specifically this location to anyone who would listen!"}
{"text":"While Lindo is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, I prefer to skip this location and go to the one in Henderson. The food is still good here, although it is better in Henderson, my friends shrimp salad had about 3 shrimps on it and every time she gets it at the other location it is LOADED with shrimp, including when we went last night. This location all feels more cozy and crowded, the tables are close together and I felt very in the way of the servers just sitting in my chair. They had a mariachi band that I could not stand, not that I mind the tradition music, it's just that this restaurant is set up like 3 small rooms so they went from room to room singing and because each room is so small is was RIDICULOUSLY loud. Also there would be other music playing in the other rooms so by the end of the night I had a migraine. All I all, I do recommend Lindo, but if you don't mind the drive, head to Green Valley."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best places to go for Mexican food the food is great I've gone here around 4 times and it's been great every time I've gone never had any bad service"}
{"text":"Came here to meet friends one Friday night. Having just come from Gordon Ramsay's BurGR I was there to socialize, not eat. With my BurGR cup in hand I joined my friends at the table. Shortly after Iexcused myself from the table, leaving my cup at the table. Upon my return I noticed my cup was gone. Disappeared. Who our server was, was not immediately clear. The first person to approach our table I asked where my cup was. Clearly someone removed it. This person didn't speak english & shrugged his shoulders & left. Another man asked me what was wrong as I clearly was annoyed & looking for someone...I explained the cup I walked in with disappeared from the table & I wanted it back. His solution?  He brought me ice tea...what was in my cup. 3 more people later and NO ONE could tell me where my cup was let alone why it was removed from the table.   Cups of soup were served to our table of 7. Again, having already eaten I was in no hurry to eat this. A few minutes after receiving it someone comes by & removes the soup from in front of me. I tell him to leave it but he takes it anyway. Charged for soup yet never allowed to eat it. Not cool.   First my cup, now my soup. My friends were worried THEIR food would face the same fate. And they were right to worry. Not 5 minutes after receiving their entrees the same person comes by & starts clearing plates...WHILE THEY ARE EATING!!    Are you kidding me? How does anyone actually eat here?  You're not allowed to. This place was packed. Did I miss something?  Oh!  That would be my food.   This place sits atop a hill with a fantastic view of the valley. Car park is small. No Parking signs on the street yet people parked here anyway.  1 star for the view.   I never got my cup back."}
{"text":"My father and I stopped in for lunch about a month ago the female bartender had no idea about their happy hour?? The hostess did not see does she said someone will bring you menu what?? So my father and I see did our cells are waiter Manny looked very upset since we had seated ourselves he was busy but he was way too rude and unprofessional he never came back to the table after taking our order he kept asking me are you ready to order are you ready to order the two bus boys helping him were better than him I finally had to get up and go get my own margarita that's how he was ignoring us the management from this place are idiots to keep Manny on any longer after that his attitude"}
{"text":"The Cadillac Margarita was amazing but too strong for my personal taste. The Strawberry Margarita was delicious; definitely recommended for those of us who do not like the strong taste of liquor. Lol. As for the food, I wasn't very impressed; too expensive for what you get. The meats [steak, chicken & lobster] were all overcooked. The highlight of the meal was the salsa served with chips & the hand-made tortillas. I would be inclined to visit again if their prices were a little lower."}
{"text":"Came into this place, into such a wonderful atmosphere and everything looked amazing! But service was extremely horrible, no flavor at all! My four friends and I never even got our soups! The chips were okay. Food tasted old and was not good at all. Never coming to this place again. Authentic food? Not even close."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time. Very very impressive! The staff was incredibly polite and attentive. It's obvious how much they care about making sure your dining experience won't be forgotten.  We had nachos, steak enchiladas, and steak tacos. Everything was prepared perfectly and we couldn't be happier. One more thing..I would recommend the fresh guacamole they prepare at the table. Amazing.  If you want real, authentic Mexican food, don't look any further. The menu is huge as well."}
{"text":"We always have a great time here.  The food is good and the kids love it too.  They have live music and it is very well decorated.  everyone there is so happy to help and work well as a team. they also happen to have an amazing view of the strip at night.  be prepared to wait though.  This place is packed ALL THE TIME."}
{"text":"The chips and bean dip were delicious! Almost at the very same moment we finished a basket, our waiter would pop out and give us a new one. He must have been hiding behind a planter and watching us or something. It was great, albeit a little creepy. As for the actual meal, I was so full of flour and refried beans that I only took a few bites and boxed the rest up."}
{"text":"For the tastiest food, most authentic atmosphere with amazing views, and stellar customer service, look no further.  A special thanks to manager Gerardo Lopez, who's attention to detail and gracious willingness to go above and beyond made this place a bookmark for me among the many dining establishments in the Valley."}
{"text":"Came back here on our return trip and was just as happy as our original visit. this time around I tried the carnitas. I enjoyed them very much, great flavor, they could have been a little more crispy, but taste-wise, excellent. love love love the warm chips and bean dip, salsa is excellent.  husband got the chicken with a funky name to it....i can't remember what it is called, but it is covered in a spicy-sweet sauce that is EXCELLENT!!!! and our waiter told us the very simple ingredients, so now I'm going to try to recreate at home. lol oh, and the fideo soup? awesome awesome. love it when they have fideo on the menu, it is kind of rare to find here."}
{"text":"Went here because I drive by it all the time. Ordered the chips and guacamole. Very plain. Waiter took forever. Wasn't good service because of the lack of communication or asking \"How was everything.\" Ordered the burrito next.  Burrito tasted awful the chicken was incredibly dry. Oh ya, don't even bother trying their soup they give you it tasted very gross. Would recommend the fish tacos though as they were delicious. Overall, I think chipotle is better at a fraction of the cost"}
{"text":"Lindo never disappoints. Amazing food, service and ambiance. Boyfriend and I will continue to come for sure. Taking uber lets us enjoy all of their wonderful day cocktails."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this spot but theres nothin special about this place but the view of the city. The food is almost flavorless and overpriced. I had the camarones a la diabla (spicy shrimp) nothin spicy about them in fact they where sweet, sucks cause thats my favorite dish but I can get a way better plate of this in North LV for half the price also almost 20 bucks for a shrimp cocktail with octupus, shoot I can pay 9 bucks at the robertos on green valley and horizon ridge for the same amount and taste way better. I'm sorry but I really wanted to like this place but the food just isn't that great put some flavor on it and give me a salsa with some kick to it I feel sorry for the people that think this is good mexican food cause they never experienced the real deal not to mention getting ripped off with these prices...."}
{"text":"Food and drink are great!  Authentic menu and ingredients with plenty of options for even picky eaters.  Large portions, I always end up splitting plates.  Top-shelf spirits and service.  Our waiter has even helped us out to the car because he saw we had a baby!  The only ding this place gets is the birthday mariachi.  With a baby in tow this really should not be the place to go if you want peace and quiet.  It's very close quarters and you will know if there is a birthday, or anniversary, or any other event in the house (and there usually are about two or three!)."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, very authentic. Not just beans and rice! If your in Vegas and a foodie, its worth the time off the strip!"}
{"text":"This place was super clean and had the BEST service ever! The waiters did not let your beverage go down past half. The chips, salsa and bean dip were promptly refilled. As for the food, I asked the waiter if they had enchiladas swissas (enchiladas with a green salsa and sour cream sauce) since it wasn't on their menu and he made it happen. I finished half of my meal, the portions were LARGE. I got two enchiladas and they were huge.   The one minor thing they get dinged on are their \"aguas frescas\", natural flavored waters. They were not authentic Mexican, more like the powdered versions, but regardless the refills were free. Many Mexican places don't give refills on these drinks.  Bottom line: If you're in the mood for good, casual sit down Mexican food, this is the place to go. Away from the crowds, great service and tasty food."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend went today and our waiter was worried about everybody else besides us and the food was terrible"}
{"text":"We were going to Vegas for my parents anniversary so I'd been checking out Groupon. They had a $30 for $60 and figured why not. Best choice ever! This was by far the best mexican food we'd ever had. They bring out warm beans and a spicy salsa to start with. The salsa was a little hot for a couple of us so we asked if they had a mild. They brought out some Pico that was fantastic and a green salsa that was mild and just as fantastic! When we asked for an order of guacamole he came out with a table, bowls, and mixed it up right at the table! It was perfect! I highly suggest the carne asado tacos! Not only was the food here great so was the service. It is worth the short drive off the strip. This will be a must eat whenever we go back to Vegas. Do yourself a favor and go eat there, you wont be dissappointed."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my family last night based on reviews.  Service was ok. Salsa and chips to start were mundane. Never had salsa like this.  The meat in every dish we ordered tasted like it was old or reheated several times. Everyone at the table immediately looked at one another upon first bite waiting for someone else to say their food was not ok.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"The staff are friendly and provided excellent service. I had the lunch special #5 Two Tacos. It was very tasty! I could tell the shells were fresh made. the shredded beef and chicken was well seasoned and very flavorful. I look forward to future business trips to Vegas; I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Menu items tried: Lobster & Steak, Carne asada salad, alma tequila flight  Pros: atmosphere, service, scenary (mountaintop view of the city), New York strip steak was perfectly cooked medium, I tried the cognac sauce on the side (mushroom, onion, sweet taste that reminded me of a Thai coconut sauce), tequila flight, garlic sauce on the side for the lobster (similar to shrimp scampi seasoning) Cons: carne asada salad was prepared better at the Desert Inn Lindo's location. The  carne asada was not seared on the outside at the Henderson location, the lobster was over cooked (very rubbery texture and required a knife to sample) I sent the lobster back to the kitchen with the message that it was over cooked and they cooked the replacement the exact same way.  The Desert Inn location is my preference.  I will definitely try the Henderson location again for the view and atmosphere, but avoid the lobster."}
{"text":"When you come to a place that's got so much hype, you think you're gonna be blown away. You think you're gonna leave satisfied with the meal you just ate (especially for the price). What did this Lindo Michoac√°n location deliver? Just good drinks and semi good service. Oh, and the guacamole was pretty good.  I am not sure any suburb of Las Vegas (hell not even in Las Vegas), can you find a true authentic Mexican food joint. Quality just isn't there. For me, who's got family rooted to Michoac√°n, this place did not deliver at all. Definitely more of a \"show\" spot.   Their alcoholic drinks? Very well done. It seems that they bank on getting you in on 2-3 drinks in before serving you their food. Good tactic, but I like to eat. Meaning I taste my food and value it's quality.  I ordered the Fajitas de Gallina (chicken fajitas). The plate was just a regular fajita skillet, it looked good. I was really hoping for steak fajitas, but was quickly discouraged due to the lack of them actually having their steak fajitas made with flank steak. Anyone one who knows Mexican food will know that's Mexican steak. Not their \"New York\" strip steak they decided to substitute.   Back to the Fajitas de Gallina. I was very tempted to ask what frozen bag these came out of. They were as dry as dry could be. Short on seasoning, very shot on quality. Just definitely not worth what the plate cost.  My wife ordered the Chile Verde (pork). Although the sauce had flavor, the pork? Felt like you were bitting into rubber cubes. Don't ask me how bland their steak burrito was, it was like chewing on grilled tofu.   One star. That's it, that's the lowest I could give. They weren't concerned about our concerns with our food, no manager came out to ask what was wrong after the server was advised of the displeasure with our plates. Therefore? I can only provide one star.   Fix your quality of food, and don't rush your customers. We are your paycheck, we are your livelihood. We deserve better."}
{"text":"Told hostess that i would like to sit on the bar b4 i get a table...hostess  very friendly ( i like to check out the place b4 i order...Bar tender name Nora was very friendly & nice to all counter customers ....  I'ved been to this place a dozen of times &  If you like Mexican Food, This is a Place to Go!!!....Very good, tasty and they have Fresh Tortilla... Service was excellent waitress( Evelyn ) very knowleagable on menu....Great Service all around !!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here for Cinco de Mayo and the food was amazing plus the view was cool, I loved it!! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Authentic, innovative and delicious, Lindo delivers Mexican with flare! No need to ask for more chips/salsa/bean dip because they bring more before you are even done with what you have. Have been there at least 10 times and what brings me back is the nuance of spices in every dish. My favorite is the Gallo el Chipolte Estilo, a smoky, spicy, moist and tender chicken entree. Another in our party got the Gallo al conaq (lemon and garlic), something I would have never ordered.as it sounded too simple.. but one bite changed that! Love the Fideo soup they serve with every meal. Typical Mexican decor, cheerful and comfortable and a staff that aims to please. Good bang for the buck... $25 per person can get a great meal and mojito!"}
{"text":"My favorite for Mexican in Las Vegas! Been to the one near the strip and on Flamingo. What I appreciate is that the recipes are truly Mexican... not American-Mexican. The menu explains each dish and the spices in detail. The hand-made tortillas really make a difference and the wait staff continually ensures your complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip are always full!. Had the Chipolte chicken and it was tender, spicy and smoky. Our son ordered the lemon chicken, something I probably would not have ordered.... that is until I tasted it! Fantastic! The guacamole they make table side can be customized to your preferences and they even put jalapenos on the side for us who like it spicier. Very accommodating. Live music in the bar at the one on Eastern, and the waiters do a  mean happy birthday at both locations accompanied by guitar!!"}
{"text":"Very good mexican food considering its vegas, its close to my favs in Denver but missing some things lol Coloradoans know what im talking about"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. Every time I visit Las Vegas, this is a restaurant I must go to. Everything I've had there has been delicious. They are usually pretty packed, but I've never had to wait very long and their customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying I used to love this place. I would come in here with people late at night all the time because it was walking distance.  Then they changed bartenders or management a couple years ago and wow, what a difference.  I told a few people how they would ignore me and it seemed like they would go out of their way to not help me. Nobody believed me until I went with someone that was a regular there (that they always treated well). He witnessed first hand how I was intentionally ignored, particularly when there were only a few other people there. I never complain or act rude so it was very odd and something I've never experienced before.  I haven't been there in a long time now and don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant a few nights ago with a big group of friends to celebrate a birthday. I'd never been here before, but I'd driven by. When I first got there I was impressed by the ambiance - there are huge windows with a great view of the valley below. There's also a band that does some live music. I had hopes for some good Mexican food as I don't really have a Mexican restaurant here in Vegas that I love. But this place was definitely a let-down. From the super spicy and not good salsa, to both the entree I ordered (bland steak fajitas) and the waiter-recommended entree that my husband ordered (ribeye with cilantro sauce - the steak was just not very quality, very fatty), this place was just a disappointment. I don't drink, but the people in our group that did were quite surprised when they got their hefty checks at the end of the meal.  I do have to say that the service was great. But other than the service and the ambiance, this place doesn't have much to offer."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican  food...very fresh. They have awesome customer service. The chips they bring are warm and they bring beans and salsa for dipping! They didn't have the sauce for the shrimp I wanted so they gave us a free dessert! The entrees: my hubby got chile rellenos with shrimp...so good!!To my fellow out of towners, make the trip off the strip to come eat some authentic Mexican food...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We headed to the area for dinner to check out the highly-rated Frank and Fina's Cocina which ended up being closed for Memorial Day.  So we drove across the street and checked out Lindo Michoacan.    -Authentic Mexican food in a convenient area. -Chips, salsa and sopa de fideo were great starters -Camarones al mojo de ajo - excellent garlicky, buttery, lemony sauce and the shrimp were not overcooked (which many restaurants tend to do for some reason) -Buey al Cilantro - steak was cooked medium and again this spicy green sauce was excellent -Tasty margaritas - yes they push their margaritas with their house tequila, but they are worth it!  I cannot understand the 3/2/1 star reviews for this restaurant - it is a solid 4 as far as I'm concerned.  Have my standards for Mexican food dropped after living on the East Coast where there is no good Mexican food?  Possibly.  But Lindo Michoacan West is worth another visit when we are in town again."}
{"text":"Friends went to meet at the bar and we had a great time... The bartender was GREAT! His name is Brian and he is from the now closed Viva Michoac√°n. I will say, It is much better than I have ever experienced in this place."}
{"text":"The food here is almost always amazing, and I have never had a bad experience with any of the service. Their prices are fair, and you always end up ridiculously full when finished eating. The atmosphere is what you would expect when walking in and you really feel like your in for some authentic Mexican food. The only real problem I have with this place is the limited parking they have available. You would think that a place that is so popular would want more parking, but the location does not really allow for much more so I can deal with it. Overall a great dining experience if you are looking for a Mexican dinner. 4/5"}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for years now and it still hasn't let me down. I've been here for random lunches, dinner dates, birthday celebrations and late-night cravings.   Food is great. I love the lunch menu since everything is cheap (yay for being a broke college student).  But the reason why I'm giving this place 5 stars is because of the service. I have never been to a restaurant with such superb & excellent service. As soon as you're seated, someone takes your drink orders and shortly places tortilla chips & dip on the table. My brother & I sometimes test the staff by seeing how fast they notice if our beverages are low. Not even a minute, someone is there refilling our glasses. Even if you would like to have your drink to-go (I love their horchatas and sometimes don't finish my drink), they refill the to-go cup before you leave.   I would suggest sticking to this location because of the service. I've been to the one on Centennial and the staff is horrible."}
{"text":"Service was slow and it wasn't busy.   I appreciated the live music but can I get a refund on my bland food? They have music playing so you don't notice the food is horrible.  The shrimp dish I had was rubbery.  Seriously, is this Mexican food? No thanks and never, ever again."}
{"text":"It's a very nice restaurant to eat at... But you guys have no idea what's goes on and how they treat employees they break rules they make them work split schedule for example go in at 9 get out at 2 come back 5 it's like working to jobs sadly employees can not complain I will not say the reason they talk employees very rude and fire employees over anything..if they don't offer you desert and a costumer complains about they make server pay out of there pocket I witnessed it trust me very good place to eat but you have no idea how they treat employees I witnessed owner cussing out employees"}
{"text":"First time here and definitely won't be my last! For starters the service was awesome and the atmosphere is great! They have live mariachi and you can request songs. Great place to go if you love mariachi music. Now for the food. You get complementary tortilla chips with salsa and refried beans. The food was delicious! I ordered the Al Pastor tacos which come with fresh homemade tortillas, rice, beans and green salsa.  Best Mexican food I have had at a restaurant in a while! I am from California and I will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best dang joint in all of the desert south west!  My girl and I make the effort to come here every time we pass through, fly out of or are nearby Las Vegas. Awesome ambiance, incredible service (like insanely good) and suuuuuch great food."}
{"text":"My friend took me here for dinner while I was in town visiting. We arrived during sunset and the view was amazing, we got to sit right against the window which overlooks the city.  Right when we say we were brought chips, salsa and bean dip. The bean dip was amazing and quickly disappeared. I ordered the organic margarita which was delicious and my friend got the frozen coconut margarita which I tried and was also very good. I definitely suggest getting the table side guacamole, made right in front of you so you can choose which ingredients you'd like. We also shared the shrimp ceviche which surprisingly I liked even though I'm not a huge ceviche fan.  After a few rounds of drinks and so many chips we were too full to order anything else. Service was great, our server Angel was very attentive and so were the bussers and helpers. I highly recommend this place for a great night, view, food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Excellent food ,excellent pi√±a colada love this place very nice ambient, definitely coming back. . :)"}
{"text":"Not the best part of town but I was told that its cheaper to drive here than to fly to Mexico.  That spoke volumes to me.  It looks so legit inside and out.   It tastes even more legit.  Only advice is come hungry.  I didn't order the burrito but I seen it and it was as big as your head.  Maybe even bigger and it was around $10.00.  Our server told us that this family restaurant has a bunch of restaurants now Lindo, Vive, and some other type of Michoacan too.  This is the original.    Fun dancing and singing going on.  Not only just the Mariachi group.    Cant wait to revisit and sit on the noisy bar side of the restaurant."}
{"text":"They have one of best views of Vegas. I love there food and the customer services is excellent. Also the hostess are very nice an are very presentable looking forward to come back"}
{"text":"Food was good but the server took about 20 minutes to bring us drink plus another 20 minutes on giving us the food. Server didn't take the time to asks us if we needed anything else after the food was served. Very upset. I believe is under new management. People slower than before. After 5 years of coming to this restaurant I will go to another chain of their own. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Great food, great views....   Long wait for a table, about 30 minutes on the weekend. Absolutely horrible parking situation.   Outstanding tableside Guacamole, great chicken fajita's and strong Margarita's.W ill be back,but not on a weekend."}
{"text":"Usualmente  es el unico restaurant mexicano que tiene la comida , el sazon que uno espera ! Siempre he ido y lo que pedia siempre era ceviche , enmoladas etc platillos muy tipicos !  Estoy embarazada por lo cual pues no pude comer mi ceviche como de costumbre a lo cual , pedi una lengua en salsa verde , sabor rico y todo muy bien , pero todo empezo en la madrugada  que comenze con un vomito, diarrea y escalofrio horrible , pues si tal cual lo sospechaba la carne no estaba en tan buen estado o no la sirvieron a la temperatura adecuada y resulto ser ina indigestion !  El resultado fue mas de 24 horas sin poder ingerir alimentos ni siquiera agua ya que todo lo que comia o tomaba lo devolvia :( .  No digo que no regresare , claro que no pero mejor tratare de pedir comida que se cocine fresca asi no me expongo a que me suceda lo mismo , ese dia no fue mi dia ! Fuimos a festejar por el dia de san valentin pero fuimos el domingo  asi que estaba ocupado como de costumbre pero no fue tanta la espera !"}
{"text":"Guacamole a must, service is great. I finished the entire plate. I highly recommend dining here."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food, and really nice restaurant. Lot's to chose from on the menu, but a tad expensive. Not gonna find much under $10 (except appetizers). Most meals are in the $10-$15 range. So if you order two meals and drinks it can quickly add up.  The fresh guacamole is a MUST! They mix it right at your table and it's SO GOOOD. Margarita's are good, but I wish they had a better happy hour.  On Sunday, they do a buffet, which is good, but not spectacular. I would just order a plate from the menu, but the buffet does give a good variety."}
{"text":"Awesome food but the service that the guys give is exceptional. Wish we had a restaurant like this in the Bay Area of Northern California."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute best! My husband and I had a destination wedding at the Mirage on a Thursday and we were looking for a location to have a lunch for our guest of about 70 people the next day. We didn't have a huge budget so having something on the strip was out of the question.  We asked a sever at another restaurant where the best Mexican food in Vegas was and he suggested this place. We couldn't agree with him more. Stephanie who we worked with for about a year delivered on everything we talked about over the phone. She was absolutely amazing! We had our spin to a traditional wedding reception on a Friday from 2-5pm during the lunch period and our guest selected 1 of 4  lunch items that we pre-selected that came with rice, beans, salad or soup, and a soft drink.  Stephanie was nice enough to create the specialized menu with our names on it. It was also happy hour so the drinks were half off. The food during the lunch period is very affordable.  When we arrived at the restaurant they reserved the entire back area for us. The customer service was absolutely out of this world. They had several servers helping us. They also sang a happy wedding song to us, put sombrero's on our head, gave us a shot of tequila and had us eat churro. It was the cutest thing.   If you are having a destination wedding in Vegas and not looking to do the traditional reception thing I would highly suggest having your guest meet at the Lindo during lunch for a great time.   Important tad bit of information: 1. They have a free shuttle service that will take you back to the strip. If you decide to take the city bus it will let you out right in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Super dissapointed.  One star only because of the view and the strawberry margarita ($10.00!) Stay away from the chicken al mojo de ajo!!!! My garlic had a very nasty burned taste!  We told the waiter it was my friends birthday and they went around and sang happy birthday to 4 different tables and never acknowledge us!  My husband had a steak salad.  My cousin had tacos. She said they were 'Roberto's good'.  So for what we paid. We are NEVER coming back.  Overpriced. Dissapointing!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints! Been here several times and every time we leave happy. Margaritas were great. Loved the Chile relleno. Chips are perfect. Brought a friend and he bragged so much his girlfriend was jealous she didn't come with us. Will keep coming back! Might try Henderson location next time just to mix it up!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service was lacking.  Most restaurants refill your coffee at least once during the meal. Our waiter took our order someone else brought it out and we were never asked if we needed anything until our waiter reappeared to give us our check.   Maybe he was having a bad day but that's not our fault!!!"}
{"text":"The music is too loud.  The food is okay, not fabulous.  The service is great.  The margaritas are too strong, too much tequila, no flavor.  But the loud music takes away from the beautiful views and excellent service."}
{"text":"Worst beef enchilada I've ever tasted.  Meat was tough and chewy.  Ranch dressing was watered down.  Not a good Mexican place to go to."}
{"text":"DO NOT come here. I was just eating the chips that they serve here and I find a piece of plastic in my mouth. Disgusting."}
{"text":"I'm in Las Vegas for work a lot and this place is a nice low-key getaway from the strip.  Conveniently close to LVCC as well. Great food, service and micheladas."}
{"text":"I had lunch today  food was good! Great view!! They had lunch specials! Dont forget to order guacamole and chips for appetizer because they make it fresh right in front of you! Who does not like fresh guacamole! They also served chips,beans, and red salsa to start.  I ordered chicken and shrimp fajitas and chicken enchiladas.  Another cool thing I noticed someone was celebrating a birthday and they bring these big hat and put it on the birthday celebrant and the servers sing birthday song!! Customer service is good  and price is reasonable for lunch specials! Yes  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Visiting from Tucson we had high hopes as it was recommended as one of best Mexican eateries in town. Margaritas were excellent, as were the salsa, beans & tortilla chips. The main courses for dinner were at best mediocre. My husband had camaron fajitas, but while the platter was hot the food was. merely warm. Sauce coating shrimp & veggies  was flavorless. The ensalada suprema con pollo a la parilla had. a crispy tortilla shell, but lettuce tasted watery and chicken was cold and had no seasoning. Ranch dressing was on the side.Unfortunately nothing brought the flavors of salad together. The sopita de  fideo was tasty and a nice addition to the meal. Waiters were attentive. If we lived in neighborhood we would not return."}
{"text":"This place was suggested by someone and turned out to live up to its claim. The restaurant was busy but we were promptly seated. There was not a moment where we didn't feel attended to as multiple employees checked on us. Service is top notch here. Food came quick, was full of flavor and well presented. The lunch pricing was a great value as we found ourselves paying less than we budgeted, and less than we'd expect for this level of service. We are happy with this suggestion and we recommend it too!"}
{"text":"It was my first time in Lindo Michoacan and the service was excellent. Our order was taken promptly and food came out quickly.The waiter stop by often to check in with us.The food taste so good I was surprised that they make fresh guacamole if you wanted some. Overall this place was really good and I would defiantly go back again. :)"}
{"text":"The service is friendly and makes you feel welcome from the time you enter the door. I am a big fan of this place and love the Camorones A'la Diabla. The fajitas are nice too. Every plate is a huge portion that fills you up."}
{"text":"I liked this restaurant and thought the food was good.  I woke up in the middle of the night with VERY BAD food poisoning.  I was sick for 3 days and almost went to the ER.  I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"I would have originally given this place like three stars, maybe.  More on that in a moment.  I usually get chili rellenos or a burrito or fajitas or something, but tonight I decided to try the pollo con rejos y crema.  It was pretty good, although I would have liked more lettuce in my \"salad\".  The chicken was pounded thin, the sauce had a lot of flavor...well not really.  It was just green and watery all over my plate.  I didn't get nearly as many strips of pasilla as I thought I would, but I got a heck of a lot of onion...  We usually get there after six, so it's already obnoxiously noisy, crowded, hot, etc etc.  Today we showed up around 5:30 and got a small break before the crowds poured in (why!?) and raised the decibel level of the place by 10000.  But I could even deal with that.  My glass stayed full, and our server was friendly and accommodating in spite of our picky (aka personalized) orders.  It was when the check came and the debit card left my hand that the real fiasco began.  Our server returned to our table, politely and quietly explaining that my card had been declined because the bank was refusing to approve the transaction.  Well duh.  Wait a minute.  WHAT!?  After 20 minutes of struggling on the phone both inside and outside (it's so LOUD) with automated lists and air headed operators, the issue was finally resolved.  No, my account was fine.  No, there had been no lock put on it due to unaccounted for activity.  Yes, the server incorrectly punched in my expiration date.  Seriously?  I know five and six are right beside each other, but SERIOUSLY?  I was steamed and so upset that the mediocre meal I'd just semi-enjoyed became a churning, angry mass in my stomach.  Thanks Lindo for frustration induced indigestion.  And I think their tortilla chips suck!"}
{"text":"I've never been to a Mexican Restaurant like this one! First, the view is great. You have a great, high view of the strip, I'd suggest come here to eat at night. There are large windows on the wall that's facing the strip so that you can enjoy it while eating inside. Second, the food is amazing! We had a spicy shrimp dish, fresh guacamole, and tongue tacos. Everything tasted delicious. You can feel and taste the quality of the food. Third, the ambient is very nice. The decor is very tastefully arranged with Mexican culture and the waiters where very nice.  You pay for what you get. It's not pricey, but it's not cheap either. I believe the shrimp dish was around 17-18$."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant when I visit Las Vegas! The margarita are fantastic ! The service is great ! If your staying on the strip you are missing a Las Vegas highlight!"}
{"text":"I organized a no-host dinner here in June 2014.  They were very accommodating over the phone, taking my reservation for 25 and not hesitating when I called a few days later increasing it to 35.  What they didn't tell me was that they wouldn't have all of the tables ready at our reservation time.  We had one large table in the middle of a room but it wasn't big enough for all of our guests.  People had to stand around and wait until diners finished and their tables/booths became available.  It was a casual group so people took it in stride, but it was a bit stressful for me as the organizer until everyone had a seat.  The wait staff was very efficient and made sure they had a drink and dinner order for every guest.  This was more difficult than you would imagine as we had people up and about, visiting with people at other tables.  I heard nothing but compliments about all of the entrees ordered and I know that my mole was quite delicious.  One more comment about the restaurant -- it is quite loud.  Between all of the conversations and the wandering mariachi band, you have to raise your voice to have a conversation.  This is not good or bad -- the place is quite festive.  But if you are looking for something more subdued then this isn't the place for you.  Overall we really enjoyed this restaurant and I would not hesitate to recommend it to people going to visit Vegas."}
{"text":"A colleague that has been here to told me about this place. It's outside of Vegas and sits on a hill. I would guess that the night time view of the strip is amazing. We had lunch after going to Hoover Damn and it hit the spot."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants in Southern Nevada, Authentic great tasting Mexican Cuisine"}
{"text":"I came here over a month ago their lunch special was terrible it had no flavor. Later on when i went to my bank to deposit I notice that the cashier gave me my change wrong, I was $10 dollars short. I called the restaurant and spoke with a manager named Noe and he stated he would return my call after counting their money drawer and checking the cameras. This man has yet failed to call me up to this date, to at least notify me of the outcome. Over all consumer service and food is terrible, it's a Joke to even call it \"Mexican food.\""}
{"text":"All Lindo Michoac√°n's are NOT created equal.  In fact, of the three I've visited recently, this is by far the worst.  We were greeted with burned chips, bitter salsa and tasteless beans.  When I insisted the burned chips be replaced, we got greasy salt free chips.  The two margaritas we ordered had a horrible aftertaste - like rotten limes - undrinkable!  We had no less than six servers come to take our order.  The steak fajita had almost no steak and was $19 for nothing.  The Red Snapper was quite good, but the sauce was as yucky as the salsa, bitter and not very spicy.  There were only four or five cars in the parking lot, which should have been my clue that this place was not up to snuff and it wasn't.  Don't waste you hard earned money at this location.  The other two, DI and Henderson are much better!"}
{"text":"So I try lindo michoacan, what a disappointment food was nasty !,I'm Mexican and I wouldn't feed this food to my( perritos dogs) Irving the waiter kept $ 12 of my change until I had to ask for it back , when he acted surprise and said , you expecting change dude, call me dude what disrespect!"}
{"text":"This will definitely be my new must have when in Vegas. It's a little ways off the strip but not crazy far and you'll be happy and satisfied that you went. Exceptional service and well put together combination plates that you can have a combination of pork, carne asada and chicken. You're full before you even begin from the chips, salsa, bean dip and soup. Lindo Michoacan, your family recipes are sacred!"}
{"text":"THE WORST Mexican Food ever!!! Not sure why this place had such raving reviews! Bland food, over priced and crap service! Feel  like throwing up literally - no wonder they have a free shuttle service from the strip!! Just can't get over such awful mexican food - it has really put me off mexican food - even Chipotle serves better tasting Mexican food!! STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"I was visiting vegas two weeks ago when my friend that lives in LV suggested that we eat here. Ilove her for suggesting this place, because I can't wait to go back to try their other goodies.  We started with the guacamole and chips, and I was pleasantly surprised that they made it in front of you. Not just that, the music entertainer played a song, while our waiter made it. I thought that was a nice touch.  I ordered the huevos con chorizo and two steak tacos. They were both excellent especially the steak. Everything was fresh, and the food presentation was excellent. I had the chance to try my friend's meals, and they were very good as well. They ordered the steak with green sauce and the steak with cilantro. The prices weren't that bad, and you really get what you pay for (probably $25 dollars a person).  The service was excellent. It seemed like we had more than one waiter, and that was fine by me. They catered to our needs and made sure that we were satisfied. The music entertainment was quite nice as well. He was singing, playing the guitar, and keyboards.   I really wish we had places like these in Chicago. Yet another reason for me to go back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for Lunch. Amazing view of the valley! Service started off weird. After we were seated someone came to our table to take a drink order, once we gave it to him he abruptly looked around then quickly walked away. He went up to another worker and they looked confused. A short time later we got our drinks from another server and never saw the first guy again. The second server was very attentive to the table.   Anyway, on to the food. Let's start by saying I'm very picky about Mexican food. I don't care for places that only serve Menudo on weekends...and guess when they serve it. That's right, only on weekends!! So I ordered the carne asada tacos with rice and beans. The tacos were very good. I had them leave off the pico de gallo because I like mine old school (meat, onion, cilantro, salsa and a squeeze of lime). The rice and beans were so-so. The chips and salsa that come before the meal were good. They also serve a small bowl of fideo (basically a noodle soup in tomato sauce and broth), it was alright, nothing like the fideo I ate growing up.   I gave LM a 3 because it's OK. Nothing about it blew me away or stands out. I will definitely go back but it's not a place I would say \"you have to try it!!\". But, go for the view and some decent food."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good quality food good drinks and mexican food  this is a good restaurant. Honestly it's not 100% authentic mexican food but still tasty. Kinda of a loud environment especially in the bar area  which is good by the way unless you're looking for a candle light dinner I'll recommend this spot"}
{"text":"Beautiful view, great (friendly, efficient, attentive) service. Had drinks, ceviche and guacamole, and fried ice cream for dessert. All very tasty."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to try it because of how highly rated it was and how the reviewers raved about the food. We got into Vegas late last Friday and drove over to eat prior to checking into out hotel. We were a party of 3 and were starving because we hadn't eaten and we were really looking forward to eating at this restaurant. The atmosphere was great, the servers were friendly and always refilled our chips, bean dip, salsa, and beverages. We order the nachos monarca's as an appetizer. They are really delicious. Then we ordered our entrees. All three of us were very disappointed in our meals. My daughter and her boyfriend ordered the Huetamo and I ordered the Morelia. There was absolutely no flavor to anything! The chicken tasted like boiled chicken and nothing else. The beef was bland, no seasoning whatsoever. The beans tasted like they were from a can, as well as the enchilada sauce. The chile relleno hardly had any cheese and the sauce was sweet (this may have been the way they make it, but I don't like sweet sauces unless it's on a dessert). The rice tasted like steamed rice, with no seasoning and they add corn, Lima beans, green beans (I don't like vegetables in Mexican/Spanish rice). It was greatly disappointing after seeing how many rave reviews they had. We barely ate our entrees and loaded up on the nachos, chips and salsa. I gave this review 2 stars based on atmosphere and attentive staff. I would not revisit this restaurant. Not at all authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Im not going to waste anytime with this review. This place is my new favortie Mexican restaurant, period.  Everything was great  I had the Enchilada, Taco and Tamale plate. Excellent! The atmosphere? Excellent! The service? Friendly and..........Thats right. Excellent!  Wife had the steak fajitas and they were great as well.  Extremely spacious parking lot.  Plain and simple, If you dont come and eat here, your missing out!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch.  The service was excellent, the prices were decent, and you can't get a better view of the strip.  I would certainly go back.  The never ending chips and salsas as an appetizer are great too."}
{"text":"This place is always packed so make a reservation if not expect to wait 15-20 min. They start you off with chips salsa and beans!! There Fideo soup that comes with most of their meals are delicious and I love their strawberry margaritas are amazing! Not a overwhelming taste of tequila but still managed to get me buzzed on only one! Try the coca cola carnitas! Service was great. Servers and very nice and will help you pick out what's good because the menu can be a little overwhelming. It's a bit pricey but worth it. 50 with tip for 2 including 1 beer and margarita."}
{"text":"My friend and I went for dinner because our mutual friends were raving about it.    Their menu was huge and had too many selections.  Once we were able to make a decision after weaving through the maze, we got some sort of noodle soup as an appetizer.  The soup had no flavor.  The main dishes came and both of our dishes had bland taste.  Nothing distinctive, but just bleh.  We were greatly disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the portions are large and filling. Order guacamole and they'll make it fresh at your table, to your specifications...wonderful! The food is never disappointing and we've brought many out-of-town visitors here.   When we go, we try to get a seat overlooking the city. The only downside would be the noise and the service could be a little better on a busy night (and it's almost ALWAYS busy), its difficult to get the attention of the waitstaff. Otherwise, great place/great food!"}
{"text":"Ok so I don't write mammy comments,  however, the few times I have been here for lunch I am always leaving with a smile on my face.  This place has great food and the atmosphere is incredible.  Not many places in Vegas have a view of the city like this location.  Never a disappointing time."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with friends while visiting Las Vegas because it was recommended through word of mouth this place has the best Mexican food you will ever try from the fideo soup to the handmade tortillas to even the beans everything here is excellent not to mention the service, we felt we had three waiters waiting on us I will definitely come back here when I visit Las Vegas! They deserve nothing less than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The food is good, worth 5 stars and the service started out good but ended up not so good. 3 stars for that. We would go back. BTW this was the Flamingo location."}
{"text":"It is good food and a fair representation of various Mexican culinary favorites. HOWEVER, this menu is NOT as food were to be served in a Mexican restaurant. The food and it's presentation are tweaks and various changes to suit all Americanized pallets. So anyone ignorant enough to assume all Spanish speakers are \"mexicans\" is really clueless. The fact is, there are diverse cultural differences in the Latino communities; one major difference is that of cuisine. Central and southern America have very different foods, nothing close to the AmeriMexican cuisine we are familiar. Example: in the entire Countries of Bolivia, Peru, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Ecuador, and others... THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF, OR EATEN \"MEXICAN TORTILLAS\".  Can you imagine... there are no flour or corn tortillas in almost all of South America? It's a fact people. They never heard of or eaten Tacos, Enchilada, Quesadilla, or burritos!  So please carefully comment here, so as to not be so obvious of your ignorances or bigotry, rather just critique the food and it's service. So remember not all Spanish speaking Latin individuals here in Nevada are all \"Mexican\".   There is a huge and diverse awesome plethora of different cuisine in all of Latin America which you should venture out and try it. Some very delicious and some, well... Just different.  This restaurant is delicious and they strive for freshness, variety, and taste. Which is pretty good and worth the cost and drive there, but they do particularly focus on \"MICHOACAN, MEXICO\" food. The state of MICHOACAN inside of Mexico does have good food and they serve all the other loved Typical \"Mexican foods\" you are used to, so try it and if you notice other Latino descent individuals dining there... Please know that they are simply there for the same reason everyone goes there, the food!  In fact would it not make sense that in fact, Mexican people could whip these things at home quite easily. But someone who is not Mexican, would be logical to eat out good food that they do not ordinarily make at home!? DUH."}
{"text":"Best mexican food !!!!! Bacon shrimp plate is the best !! Very nice service , if you order guacamole they will do it in front of you !!!! Try it"}
{"text":"Waiter provided excellent service. Food came out at the right time. Loved the chips and guacamole."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years, and have has almost everything on the menu. Hands down my favorite Mexican place in town! I can't say just one thing is the best, I'd say get a combo plate, and go wild. The margaritas are great, and they have the best tequila selection as well. 21+ can sit at the bar surrounded by all the beautiful bottles and enjoy the live entertainment. I've never had a bad experience here in the 6+ years I've been going."}
{"text":"The view, the service, the birthday song, the music,....  All was amazing.  The server even invited my kids to make the guacamole.  My only less-than-perfect issue was the steak fajitas.  The steak isn't very flavorful.    Still though, everything else was so good.  Lindo still gets 4 stars."}
{"text":"Mi primera vez!!! En vegas!!!:)y benir a lindo michoacan fue algo delo mejor. El mejor servicio al cliente,el mejor sazon mexicano todo loke me comi fue delicioso,y para terminar con uno delos mejores postres k e probado #LINDO FLAMEADO algo bien les recomiendo este buen lugar..."}
{"text":"Been to your restaurant many of times the food is always delish. I think the servers are pretty good but maybe can step up their game a bit. Last time we went our server delivered our food then we never saw him again when we walked out he was sitting down I guess on a break. Tonight we went out for an early Valentines dinner. The server must of went on break.  I think it is rude. At least inform your guest that you are going on a break and so and so will take care of you... we were sitting there looking for our waiter then asking other employees and management for napkins boxes and even our bill.   They took my girlfriends sour cream off the table and she wasn't even finished with it.  Some improvement needs to be looked at so the customers are not forgotten and neglected."}
{"text":"By far some of the best food I have ever had.  Not just the best Mexican food, but some of the best ever.  With all the great restaurants in Vegas, Lindo's beats them all.  I ordered the Fillet de something?  It was orange roughy with shrimp and octopus.  Just the right amount of heat with corn tortillas on the side.  Our server Dhiadora (I think ) was great.  Very attentive and makes a tasty Margarita.  I'd give it 14 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"***Amazing food*** I tell everyone I know about this place. I take all my out of town relatives here and they all love it."}
{"text":"Like many other reviewers, had been to other locations and lived nearby so this was a natural place to try out. The first  major difference though is the seating - not like the others it is very much a more open floor plan but the view...just WOW. A giant wall of window overlooking the entire city of Las Vegas. Go at sundown for an impressive show. It is not quiet though, between the open floor plan noise and the mariachi singing its not a place for a quiet date. Wish they had seating outside for the cooler evenings like the night I went but with all the windows it kinda felt almost like you are.  I ended up behind the bar and got my favorite at other locations - a Cadillac margarita. This one didn't have quite the kick like the ones I have gotten in other locations however. I watched the girl pour it and they put a good amount of tequila in but it just didn't seem as potent. Beyond that though everything was great. I love the carnitas! Make sure you come in hungry though as they make sure to fill you up! The servers at this location were great and friendly and one even shared a knowing smile and nod with me when a woman walked by wearing a tube top that barely held them in (if you know what i mean ;)). Its a little pricey for the types of dishes they serve but well worth it for the ambiance of mariachis and the view. I think those things make up for the price that the other locations don't really have."}
{"text":"The food is ok. I've had better. Good customer service.   Don't order the Agua de Tamarindo. It is watered down and looks like iced tea. It doesn't taste like tamarindo at all.  The chips, salsa and bean dip they bring you when you first sit down are good. I ordered the huevos con nopalitos. They were a little bland. The rice was good."}
{"text":"Love this place. Nice atmosphere, great food and drinks. My daughter loves coming here to watch the ladies make tortillas. My son loves the Fideo   I enjoy the drinks lol we always leave with a smile."}
{"text":"Great view!   Awful food! Mediocre service!   They need to change it back to the Italian restaurant that it was before."}
{"text":"Very good food. Service is A+. Drink refills were always on time. An excellent option of you're in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff! My new fav pkace. I will be here again foe sure"}
{"text":"Horrible ! Never going back again ! Chip and salsa was what I had my heart set on and it was flavor less , comon how can you mess up chip and salsa. The service was terrible just as bad as the food ! No flavor at all ! None what so ever ! Authentic my a*** ."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service was nice, but the food was horrible. I had the #6 combo beef taco, beef enchilada and beef tostada. The salsa was nasty the chips had a burnt taste and the beef had no taste at all. After the third bite I was done. Hubby had the tacos al pastor. He made it through one taco and that was not good either. The soda and bean dip were good. The beans and rice on the combo plate were ok. Will not go back again"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant-the food is good, the atmosphere is fun and lively, plus they have an amazing view of the city!  Their fideo soup is delicious!  Their sopitas, enchiladas and fajitas are all great too!"}
{"text":"Doordashed food from here. Very good food. Husband really enjoyed the fideo soup, just like his Mom's. Shrimp aguachile, very flavorful and nice big shrimp. Salsa was very tasty. Wasn't sure if delivery would be secure, with soup and shrimp but everything was packaged well."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food and fantastic Margaritas. I highly recommend sitting on the indoor patio with the view of the strip.   The homemade tortillas are fantastic and the wait staff is always friendly. The live entertainment at dinner is excellent and adds to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Bomb margaritas. Both strawberry and lemon. Had really good service. And the food was really goo too. They have good lunch specials. Overall I will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. The services is fantastic and the view is beautiful. A bit pricey for Mexican food but the servings are large and the food is authentic."}
{"text":"Went to Lindo Michoacn to celebrate a friends birthday. Like everybody says the view was great too bad I can't say the same thing about the food. I ordered the chili colorado and the meat was so tough I couldn't eat it. My wife ordered the carnitas and it was so dry she stopped eating it after two bites. Service was fine but the drinks were overpriced. We won't be going there again. Still looking for a really good Mexican restaurant any where in the Las Vegas, Henderson area."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a birthday. They bring out a crew of employees as well as a musician with a guitar, and hand you a shot of tequila. The toreados with guacamole are amazing. We started off with some oysters as an appetizer and to my delight they came topped with ceviche. Good service and very friendly employees. Bar has a crazy amount of different tequilas."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. We used to drive across town to the original before they opened this one several years ago.   Service is always attentive. Always refilling water, chips and salsa without needing to ask.  we always sit in the room to the right because my kids do not like the music in the other room.  We were two adults and  3 kids. My wife and I ordered the Gallo mojo de ajo which is chicken with garlic gravy. The gravy has chunks of garlic which I love.  the chicken here is pounded thin which I like as well. The flour tortillas are thin and excellent and are served with the dish.  One of our kids split with us and two ordered of the kids menu.   we also ordered the table side Guacamole. They come to the table and make it right there. They ask how spicy you want it. it was good.   If you order order a meal they bring a red soup with noodles is very tasty.   The food came very quickly which was nice because we had our kids with us.  overall. it is a good solid restaurant."}
{"text":"Loved the soup! We haven't had Mexican food this good in a long while"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants I have ever tasted. The only bummer is getting there. Far away from the strip and almost impossible to get a taxi ride back. However, the food is outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Top notch customer service. Reasonable prices and delicious food! Also they have a great view!! I totally recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! The staff is great. The food is amazing. I love the guacamole appetizer. They make it table side just the way you like it. The margaritas are the best in town. This is the best place in Vegas for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"OMG! This is the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas!  We always go there for special occasions in our family.  The service is spot on! No one \"walks\" in that place, they \"fly\"! Our chip bowl is never empty. We always get the bean dip, guacamole dip (made right at the table), and the salsa dip. We're always too full for dessert.  But if it's your birthday, watch out! They'll put a sombrero on you and throw a shot of tequila with a worm in it down your throat.  Ugh   I don't go there on my birthday."}
{"text":"Great Food, great guacamole and salsa and great service. Close to home so I go there often. Take out is good to. Definitely worth it. Prices are good. Gets noisey with tequila birthdays on occassion. Always consistent with everything, food, service.  A keeper"}
{"text":"Great place to take friends when they visit us out here in the desert. Excellent service, food, and margaritas!"}
{"text":"Ladies at bar are always so sweet! Joy, Sarahi are very attentive,  great with knowledge of the drinks!"}
{"text":"Came here twice around 8:30 pm, busy, got seated right away right by the window with a nice view both times, the big burrito I had the first time was nothing mind blowing but great, the second time I went I got chicken flautas made with flour tortillas and they were awesome."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch meeting.  The chips and salsa/bean dip were fresh fantastic.  Excellent customer service from the time you walk in the door to the time you leave.  The view is spectacular.  I can't wait to go here at night for the view.  I had Pollo Rebeca (cactus with grilled chicken) that was excellent!  Ask for the ice cream desert w/bananas and liquor that is served on fire.  AMAZING!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service. Extremely attentive. The mole chicken enchiladas were best I've ever had. Salsa and hot sauce were great and beer was cold. Definitely worth the drive off the strip"}
{"text":"The food is not bad.  However, the customer service is horrible.  The wait staff takes too long to deliver your food and drinks.  I have been there on several occasions and have experience the same poor service."}
{"text":"Wow what a place my gf and I killed a couple of amazing minchiladas our waiter Ramon made awesome suggestions and gave us great service  the whole way the food was outstanding can't wait to come back when I'm not on a damn diet"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant.  The location could be better but the execution was perfect.  Very nice atmosphere with very friendly and fun staff.    I arrived at the restaurant Sunday morning around 11am.  After a short review of the menu I decide to try there Sunday morning brunch.  Which was a reasonable deal considering it came with drinks.  The brunch bar itself is somewhat awkwardly setup in the bar area.  However it was still a nice presentation with a wide variety of options.    Being a buffet I of curse had to have a taste of every option laid before me.  I was very pleased with everything.  All of the food seemed to be fresh and didn't have any signs of being attended for hours before I arrived.  The fresh made tortillas and margaritas are amazing.  One final note about there handling a birthdays.  This particular dining occasion was to celebrate a friends birthday.  After our meal the entire wait staff came over with a guitar and sang a birthday tone in Spanish.  They also treated the birthday boy to a shoot of tequila and some churrus with a candle in them.  It was very entertaining, on the restaurant, and no one in our group put them up to it.  Overall a very nice place to eat drink and be merry."}
{"text":"Love this place great food great intertainment. I come here with my family all the time so I recommend this place if you are looking for a good family dinner"}
{"text":"Let me start with the food , I have been here before and the food last night was ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. I went with a party of 25 and at least 3 got sick from the food we had. Next, the service was rude and couldn't handle the size of our party. Everything we ordered either took over ten plus minutes to come or didn't come at all! Then when the checks came 4 of us in the group all got over charged! They waiter came up to me with the correct charges I handed him my card and when he came back HE SWIPED MY CARD WITH A LARGER AMOUNT! Then as I tried to explain he made a mistake he got very upset and rudely told me to calm down when I did nothing but try to understand how they could give me my correct bill then come back with a different bill, higher amount with more drinks then I had. He also tried to tell me I was paying for a drink I didn't order or drank that he brought to the table. This situation was completely disrespectful to me and my party and for this I'll never return. I suggest you go and spend your hard earned money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Parking was absolutely atrocious,  had to park forever far away and walk. I ordered a shrimp dish and the shrimp was badly over cooked. I had to send it back for the chile verde, which was delicious. Margaritas were great. I think the prices are high for the quality. Nice bathrooms and great service though!"}
{"text":"OMG, the beef tacos...seriously the most delicious thing ever. If you're looking for a lovely, authentic Mexican dining experience, this is the place."}
{"text":"Probably the best Mexican Restaurant we have found in Las Vegas .  Fairly small and off the beaten path.  More for locals than visitors.  Service is expedient and excellent.  Great choice in menu, takes a while to read the entire menu.  All the typical Mexican dishes plus a lot of house specialties.  Probably ranks as medium priced.  Food was positively excellent, just too much to eat."}
{"text":"Love this place! Go here and expect lots of happy noise of people enjoying themselves. Fast serve, friendly staff and family atmosphere.  Food is outstanding.  You prob have to wait for your table average about 15-30 minutes. But no worries your not in a hurry, have drink and relax"}
{"text":"Ok Mexican food, nothing stands out, more food for white america, nothing really Mexican there.  Good micheladas though..."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my husband tonight.  We were sat in one of the booths that are close to the entrance and had virtually no view.  After eating our bland meal we walked down to the area behind the bar which had an awesome view.... AND 90% empty seats.  The food looked good but was very bland, I added the salsa from the chips to my meal.  The sauce for the green pork burrito was odd tasting too....very lime/citrusy tasting."}
{"text":"Used to be one of the best in Vegas...not anymore! Meals are overpriced and quality is not the same...will not be coming back. Especially after talking to the manager about my experience and his response was a smirky smile...so sad but it's their loss."}
{"text":"Great beans, amazing margaritas, fresh guacamole, and good service!  We went on a weekday, but I'm told they have live music on the weekends  Looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"We got there after 2pm on New Year's Day and the place was packed, but we've been here before and we knew the wait would be worth it. The staff are friendly, fast and genuinely want to provide you with great service! We were seated and drink orders were taken immediately. The drinks arrived pretty fast as did the chips and salsa. Warning: if you ask for the habanero salsa, you will get burned! t is HOT and tasty if your tongue doesn't fall off first. The food arrived promptly. It was hot, delicious and there was plenty of it! Even though they were busy, they did not hurry us and allowed us to eat at our leisure.  Like I mentioned earlier, we'd eaten there before because we wanted a tasty, authentic Mexican food experience. It's a few miles off the Strip but well worth the drive. A taxi will run you about $20 and the restaurant provides a shuttle service which came in handy.  Good Food, Good Drinks, Good People!"}
{"text":"Good food but the preparadas are the best! Good customer service, just gets really crowded other than that it's a good dinner place. Prices aren't bad the hubby and I went there for dinner and drank until closing (at least 5 preparadas each) lol All for $120! Great price specially here in Vegas."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good Mexican food, don't come here. If you are looking for great Mexican food and authentic atmosphere this is the place. The exterior of the building at this location just looks like almost any other building. But once you walk inside you can see the love put into the decorations throughout the interior. I have been to many Mexican restaurants that go way overboard with decorations to look authentic and just look like stereotypical.  From the moment my wife and I walked in we well taken care of. We were seated quickly. Beverages were brought quickly. And we never lacked for a quick refill of our drinks. Our waiter was very friendly and answered all of our questions. This is some of the best service we have received at not just any restaurant but anywhere.  Go to any Mexican Restaurant and you will find the menu loaded with Tacos, Burritos, Nachos, Enchiladas, and Taco Salads. Lindo Michoacan has some of these on the menu, but they are a very small portion. Some of the items on the menu are Pollo al Mojo de Ajo, Chili Verde and Colorado, Camarones Rancheros and much more. My wife and I ended up ordering the same item. We both got a Chili Lime Chicken. This came with a side of beans and rice and also came with flour or corn tortillas made on site. They came out fresh and hot. They were full of flavor and complemented the rest of the meal. The chicken was flavorful as well and had the right amount of tang with the lime squeeze. So there is Mexican food and truly authentic Mexican Food. This is the real deal and now my favorite Mexican Restaurant."}
{"text":"It's okay, I honestly don't see what all the hype is. I've been here twice. The first time was at lunch and I had a taco and an enchilada that tasted like the sauce was out of a can and uncooked. The second time for dinner was better. I had a skirt steak, which was good, but nothing I'd rave over. I miss El Jeffe's (creativity and flavor).  On the upside, the view is incredible. The service was alright and yes, the restaurant is loud, but you have to blame that on the previous owners that built the horrible Italian restaurant that was there."}
{"text":"wow...came on Friday during happy hour...highly recommend this restaurant...thumbs up for the ambiance, friendly and attentive staff, delicious food and 2 for 1 awesome margaritas!  we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended but truly disappointed. Staff is friendly. Order was wrong. They did offer free desert. That was good. Flan!  Too pricy. Will not recommend and will not return. Sorry!"}
{"text":"It was out first time going here and I'm glad I finally stopped by! The service was great. The manager heard it was our first time and sat us down by the window, giving us an awesome view.  The food was great too,  especially considering the price.  Would definitely go back here again!"}
{"text":"I recommend Lindo Michoacan if you want authentic Mexican food. I appreciate the fact the menu isn't littered with Tex Mex options. The menu includes authentic dishes from the region, and the staff are eager to recommend your next favorite dish. I have a gluten allergy, and I was still able to find some really excellent dishes. The decor is lovely, and the place doesn't have a cheesy feel. I look forward to dining here more often, especially since it has so many yummy margaritas."}
{"text":"Services was amazing! View fantastic. Good delicious. Manager was actively moving and checking on customers."}
{"text":"My primary complaint is that the plates are served warm, not hot.  There is nothing worse than tepid enchiladas, except cold tortillas.  Why serve tortillas in a basket? They get cold so quickly.   I'd heard great things about this restaurant, but it is a disappointment.  The chips are thick and over-fried and the salsa is weird, not fresh. Skip the shrimp cocktail--the shrimp are swimming in cold juice, like a gazpacho, but not as good.  The Cadillac margaritas are tasty, but how hard it is to make a good margarita in this town?   The guacamole is bland.  I had to add hot sauce and squeeze lemon juice on it.  Chili's has better steak fajitas at a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"They crammed our party of 5 into a table for 4.  Absolutely terrible service.  They forgot to make our fresh guacamole that we had ordered for an appetizer and brought out our main courses first.  All the dishes were barely warm.  When they did make the guacamole, it tasted terrible.  Way too much lime and jalape√±os.  We couldn't finish it and asked for a refund.  Both plates of enchiladas were lacking in sauce and tasted very dry.  Definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"The view is simply amazing. Also the atmosphere is really cool and they almost always have live music going. The service is excellent and the people working here are quick, knowlegable, and friendly. Other than that, I wouldn't say the food is terrible but it's definitely not good. Not sure if they just use bad quality meat but it's just chewy and tasteless. I've tried here quite a few times and same results with almost all the meats on their menu. I basically come here now for drinks and the view. Also the parking is terrible but not.much they can do about that not really their fault, the place is usally pretty packed. Again, I'm not saying it's a bad place but food wise just not the best or neccesarly authetnic either."}
{"text":"Food is decent enough especially for the price but they RUSH customers out the door, not in a rude way, it actually shows they're being attentive. As soon as you're done eating, like within 30 seconds they ask if they can get you anything else before presenting the check. The rushing is actually a plus because as busy as they get, you never have to wait for a table"}
{"text":"ok i heard that this place was awesome as the food and service so i took my girlfriend to eat there and  the place is nice and the service is amazing BUT the food was disgusting I expected something better as most of the people say that its an amazing place but the food is just horrible this restaurant serves  mexican food if the food they serve is mexican then tacobell is the place to eat if you dont know about mexican food then you should try another places so you can get a better idea of the real mexican food plus if you like to pay for the service and not for your food then you'll  be fine in my case ill pay dont matter the price as long as the food is delicious something that this place doesnt offer thats just my idea"}
{"text":"We are locals and this is by far our favorite mexican restaurant! The food is really good and the Cadillac margaritas are awesome!! It's a fun restaurant and the view of the Las Vegas strip is so cool. They keep us coming back quite often and we always bring our out of town company there. It's a must try if your in the area!!"}
{"text":"Great food at somewhat inflated prices.  I had the fish plate, which was okay, but my large party had very yummy looking entrees of their own.  Good, chill crowd and a live dinner band."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. Hate to say it but it doesn't have the flair Id expect from the food. The service and experience were to be expected and met expectations. Good left everything to be desired. I have more flavorful meals at Roberto's ordering an adobada burrito. Wouldn't return for the price. The mole was sweet and not at all as rich as would be expected. I make mole and its never sweet. Always solid and thick, as opposed to watery and runny."}
{"text":"After hearing from multiple people how amazing this restaurant (and this location in particular) was, I decided it was time to try it out.   The feel of the place when you walk in is super authentic and welcoming, and the staff was some of the most attentive and polite service I've had at any restaurant in Vegas.  The House Margarita was delicious and a pretty decent size for the price ($8). The complimentary chips, dip & salsa are very good as well, the salsa has a good kick to it. The combo specialty plates are HUGE. More than enough for one person. Each plate comes with rice & beans plus fideo soup to start the meal. The soup was very flavorful and one of the highlights of the meal. I ordered the chicken enchilada, chicken taco & chicken tostada plate (Combo #6) and only ate half of everything. The person I was with ordered the beef enchiladas (both plates came with rice and beans, so a LOT of food) and he loved his meal as well.   One thing that should be noted is how AMAZING the view is overlooking The Strip. Definitely a major bonus for dining at this location. Everything was reasonably priced, the food was delicious and the staff were fantastic, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"if you like salt as a primary flavor than this is the place. after reading many good things I ate there  my last trip to LV,  the Chili Verde was  so salty i had to cut it with a average Margaretta. no taste of tomitios or green chilli  lack luster rice and beans. even the stuffed pepper had non melted cheese  (couldn't call it a chilli rellno )in said this place was needing a reboot,"}
{"text":"best place in town for amazing mexican style food and the best soup ive ever had!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Friendly staff, good atmosphere, the view is phenomenal, food is great, large portions. My family and I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Just returned from dinner at this restaurant.   The restaurant is beautiful, we were seated promptly, the vocalist was great and our bus boy was terrific!   However this is a restaurant and we expected a good meal experience.   Our waiter was not pleasant and didn't even speak to us other than to ask if we were ready to order.  I ordered cheese enchiladas and was served beef enchiladas so I had to send it back.  The cheese enchilada they brought back to me had so much cheese you could not find the tortilla.   The food was not good and flavor was boring.   I was extremely disappointed especially since this restaurant had received best of Las Vegas 2012.   My guest felt the same way about his dinner.   If you want a nice bar and  want to listen to good music, then I recommend this place.  If you want good Mexican Food, I recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went here for Breakfast, had some bloody mary's, it was awesome, the seating is nice, the staff is Awesome and the food is just incredible, this place is a must!!!  We had the Chorizo, Machaca and Carnitas...All Bomb.."}
{"text":"This place sets the standard for authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas. Their attention to detail is off the charts and the service you receive is top quality. The theme of the restaurant is amazing and i would definitely come back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 30 and the staff was very attentive and did not fail to entertain!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and it keeps getting progressively worse.  The view is amazing and the service has always been short but attentive.  The food however is not worthy.  Tonight our fajitas were terrible.  Absolutely, bland with no seasoning at all.  The presentation was bad too.  Looked  like canned dog food.  Fajitas are such a simple dish to make delicious with a little thought and care.  As well as my daughters enchilada was cold when it hit the table.  I think the kitchen needs to be retrained and management needs to slow everything down, so people can relax enjoy themselves and hopefully enjoy some good Mexican fair.  Instead of having that turn and burn mentality."}
{"text":"I usually visit the location, but this lazy, weatherly Friday night I didn't want to go out so I ordered through Postmates. I have to say, everything was absolutely perfect, from my add-ons to my deletions (with a tiny absence of my Ranchero sauce ) Steak cooked perfectly, the chips, salsa and frijoles you get complementary when you come in were all included, plus the extra salsa requested, an abundance of fresh, hot tortilla chips, fideo, guacamole, corn and flour tortillas, etc. My bag must've weighed several pounds! Being a Dallas transplant, good Tex-Mex was a challenge to find here. But this place is definitely a gem!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service and a great view of the Strip.   We will return next time we have a hankering for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago, a friend and I came for dinner.  All I can say is....The service was excellent!  From the time we entered the door and was seated, to the time we order our food. Our waiter Mario was very friendly and attentive to what we were ordering. He suggested I order the enchiladas with the green sauce....I must say, that was a very good choice!! The food is very delicious!! Whenever our glasses were running low, they refilled right away.   I would suggest Lindo Michoac√°n to all of my friends!   Everyone was so friendly, until the time we left. You're greeted upon arrival and open the door for you as you're leaving and suggest, to have a goodnight with a smile!!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for more than an hour, I have requested a window side table, n the estimated time was 45 minutes. This is the longest time I've waited for a restaurant. This is outright outrages, even with assistance from the manager, we still have not been seated. I feel as if I'm an overseer of this restaurant rather than dining here. I've seen people come and go while I'm still waiting. After being seated, the food came in fast enough that we did not have to complain, we were also occupied with chips with salsa and frijoles. My enchiladas with mole and chicken was accompanied with the classic red rice and frijoles. Although nothing special, they were great. The chicken was on top of the smothered enchiladas. The mole was too potent to eat without the rice and beans. The chicken was rather bland but was needed to fully enjoy the enchiladas which only contained cheese. After finishing our meals, we were served a complimentary slice of cake and small serving of flan. They were both delicious and were enforced by the manager for out hour and a half wait. The mariachi band played in area of window side tables. Our party of seven were all full and satisfied and had multiple boxes of leftovers. The whole experience was long and felt like we spent our entire day there just for dinner. Overall the food was good but the staff was only helpful when one of the managers got involved."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I had a double birthday party there for 50 people and they were fantastic.  Our service was great  and their drinks are fantastic!"}
{"text":"My partner and I came here for date night and both ended up with food poisoning. We will not be returning to this restaurant!!! Be cautious; Ensure everything is fully cooked."}
{"text":"We waited like an hour to be seat after we got seated we waited about a good 2 to 3 hours for our food to be ready once they gave us our food they only gave me 5 shrimps and a little bit of veggies the rest was pure juice with onions I did not like the service definitely not going back there again"}
{"text":"Very Loud, margaritas decent, probably the worst chicken taco salad I've ever had.  Won't go back.  Fun place for a birthday and great view."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Lindo I didn't like.  The addition of the beautiful view to the wonderful food is awesome."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food anywhere in the country and I grew up in Texas and have traveled everywhere!  Fabulous! Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Worst food ever.  Nothing was seasoned, pork was tough, chicken was bland and tough and the chili relleno was undercooked (the cheese inside the rellano wasn't even melted and the chili was almost raw).  This was the third and last time to try this place hoping it would get better, it hasn't.  I wish I could say something good about the food but every visit has been a bland experience.  I guess this place has never heard of seasoning."}
{"text":"I came in here around 10:00 am on Saturday. The place was packed! However, we were seated right away. I was extremely impressed with the authentic and unique d√©cor of this place. It was beautiful. Very original Mexican style. Not likes some of the fake cheesy Mexican joints. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Live mariachi playing. They have a hand-made tortilla stand with ladies constantly making fresh tortillas. If you order guacamole, it gets hand made to order right at your table. Also, when you are seated, they bring fresh refried bean dip, salsa, chips and Mexican noodle soup (sopa de fideo). Very nice touch by the way! I'm from Los Angeles, and I've never been to a restaurant like this before. I will definitely be coming back here next time I visit my family in Las Vegas. :)"}
{"text":"The service was great! They serve you fresh beans, salsa, and chips as an appetizer when you sit down. You can even ask for more beans, chips, and salsa. Which we did! My mother ordered a carne asada medium rare, it was very dry and hard to eat so then she told the waiter about it. They are very understanding and cooked her another carne asada with new sides, they didn't just give her another piece of steak. It was way better than the other a lot more tender and soft. I on the other hand ordered a carne asada burrito. It was amazing and the meat was juicy and tasty. The size of the meals are pretty good for one person. Everyone was nice and polite as we entered and left."}
{"text":"Ok food today. Table next to us,was very loud glad they left so we could finish our ok meal  Usually have good food at this time. Maybe the good cook had a day off."}
{"text":"would give 5 stars but the bathroom is soooo tiny.  The restaurant itself is very large and spacious with great city views in the rear depending where you get seated.  The staff is normally very quick and you feel spoiled from the great service.  Always enjoy coming here.  Live music - atmosphere is wonderful"}
{"text":"I think Lindo has really good food sometimes they have everything fresh and sometimes they don't. The shrimp sometimes taste like it was frozen for to long and they in froze it to quickly it has that bitter taste to it. The cool thing about it is when you tell the manager what's going on they take it off the bill. The carne is really good and so are the carnitas. The service is sometimes good but sometimes not. The vie whoever is incredible for a nice romantic dinner. I give them restaurant 3 stars"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love the city views from the front seating window view! I called ahead of time to put in a reservation and that worked out perfectly & when we arrived there was not much of a wait time. I recommend making reservations ahead of time. I requested a window table :) Great service & fun atmosphere. I ordered the vegetable enchilada and it was so tasty and came out so hot. I love that they serve you refried beans along with your chips and salsa! Everyone was satisfied"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I have to say, I must be really spoiled from the great Mexican food in Los Angeles, because the food here had NO flavor!!  I ordered the chicken tostada shell and although there was a lot of chicken, it had zero flavor and was really dry.  My husband had the huevos ranchos (I will give them one star for that meal), my Mom ordered the nachos, which were okay, Dad ordered the Botana 'Papa Chencho' (an appetizer) that looked great, but again...the food had no flavor-as in, NO seasoning at all and the meat (chicken and beef) both were really dry.    I would guess anyone could swing a dead cat and hit a better Mexican restaurant than this place. Seriously though, with all the awards and five star reviews, this place is a huge disappointment and WAY overpriced.  The second star is for the excellent wait staff.  I feel bad that their tips may suffer for the awful food.  On a side note, the restaurant wasn't very clean.  Needless to say, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I had been to the Lindo Michoacan near the strip, so my family and I wanted to try this one.  The Lindo Michoacan near the strip set the standard that I assumed all Lindo Michoacans follow.  However, this location did not meet my expectation.  We sat down and had our drink orders taken.  After the waiter brought us our drinks, we didn't see him for 15 minutes.  In that time we had finished our drinks and couldn't get a refill on the drinks or the chips and salsa.  I assume he was busy elsewhere because the wait staff appeared to be understaffed, as a man in a button up shirt and khaki trousers who appeared to be the manager was bringing dishes out to people's tables.  The man in the button up eventually motioned our waiter to our table and our waiter took our order.  The food came a little while later.  The food was fantastic, as it is at both locations I have been to."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas last Friday 8/7,  my girlfreind and I hopped in a cab and asked the driver if he knew any good Mexican resturaunts in the area.. after a $25.00 cab ride we were greeted by a young hostes who was very freindly.  We ordered the red chille plate. the chips came to our table, they were warm and stale! then the food, we both took 1 bite of the steak picado and could not eat anymore! I am not a complainer but when the waiter ask me how it was I told him, \"it is discusting\" he asked why I explained it was very chewy. his reply was \"you want some ceviche or something\" I said please just give me the bill. after spending $100.00 to get there take 1 bite and get back to my hotel I just had to say something. I would leave only 1 star, the second star is for the nice hostes only. I have never in my life had worse!"}
{"text":"Was recommended this restaurant. Great food. Great view at night past the bar. Services was fast and friendly. I never asked for more water because it was always topped off. That is top notch."}
{"text":"Awesome place to take your loved ones to!!! Great authentic Mexican food!!! Their servers go extremely out of their way to please you!!!! I will definitely come back next time I am in Vegas, little pricey but worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great but food was left for something to be desired. My wifes lengua plate seemed like sat way too long under the heat lamp. It tasted old and was really dry.  My huevos rancheros were not cooked correctly there was a taste of old oil to them."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for a week and stopped by this restaurant. It was great for the family and has a very celebratory design to it. The waiters were super attentive and guacamole was great.  I will be back again when I am in town."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic and the service is almost military as there are a lot of staff members who all have specific duties and do them well.  Great place for lunch."}
{"text":"I really don't know what happened to this place, about a year ago it really started to go down hill, I keep going here hoping it can get back to normal but it is still in decline. The beans taste like they cracked open a can. the salsas are all watered down and not tasty. The only thing they still try on is the hand made tortillas and the guacamole.  Sad, this place was great."}
{"text":"Maybe It was an off day for them or I'm too picky but the food here to me was nasty.  Then we have our waiter who dropped our drinks and didn't return until a manager noticed us 15 minutes later.   My tamal was so soggy and saturated in salt. My enchilada tasted like it had been sitting out for some time and my beans were crusty. My mom got the tacos. Chicken and Carne Asada were okay (but also salty). My daughter got the kids beef taco. They bring us a taco filled with plain, dry tasteless steak. \"Can we get cheese please? Or something to go with it?\", \"sure, sure\" did they come back...nope. My dad got a different enchilada and liked it but he covered it in sour cream and didn't care either way. To think we were going to go to Lucille's until we decided we felt like some good Mexican smh."}
{"text":"Went back here recently and got the same chicken with garlic sauce dish I did before. The last time it was amazing, this time it was pretty tasteless. I don't know how it could go from a 10 to a 2 like that but I guess some of the chefs just are not as good there. I was with someone else who always gets the chilaquiles there and they said it was great like any other time.  Maybe they have hired new chefs now, I don't know. I almost feel like I got swindled out of the $14.95 I paid for the dish with how badly it compared to the first one. Still giving it a 4 because I like this place and the other things I have gotten there have been good in the past."}
{"text":"A great Mexican restaurant in Henderson. Great views of the strip. The restaurant was a little pricey for me. The guacamole dip was spectacular- they bring full avocados to the table and whip it up in front of you. Yum"}
{"text":"We were a party of 18 guest so I think that was difficult enough. We returned a few plates   bc the food was cold and unfortunately my plate was sitting so long under the heat lamp and that caused my rice/beans to get hard from the top. Staff was very friendly but I've had better Mexican food at home. Let's just say my favorite part was the chips and bean dip."}
{"text":"Great food! They have a wide variety of selection. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  I will say that the beverages such as the horchata and the tamarindo are too sweet, not what I'm use to. However, the alcoholic drinks on the menu are very well prepared, just like the food.  Overall, delicious food and awesome spot with a nice view."}
{"text":"First and foremost, this place has a great view! Quick and attentive service. Reasonable prices and good lunch specials. Fresh and yummy guacamole made right at the table. Overall a fantastic find!"}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for years this is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Vegas by far"}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times over the many years living in Vegas. I love the tremendous variety on the menu and the consistent high quality of food. Service usually is good but can be slow if they are really busy.  The only problem is the very loud and noisy environment. This makes it hard to have a conversation if it is desired, but we go for the food!!!  All dishes are excellent and anything can be tried with wonderful delight   You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"The service is always good. The food is ok. For Wexican food i guess its ok for what it is. The prices are ok but should be lower due to the quality of the food. Its fast so it must not be fresh and made to order... I only come here when a friend wants to go but def not my choice. I prefer Juan's Flaming Fajitas over this place..."}
{"text":"I am not a local but I do know my way around a restaurant.  At first looks, Lindo Michoacan surpassed my expectations.  I read some of the reviews and was skeptical about my dinner experience here.  Needless to say I was taken aback by the view of the city, it was spectacular!  The view itself brings two stars to the table.  On to the food.  The portions were large and filled with flavor, unlike many Mexican food establishments that have very bland and flavorless offerings.  I had the Kikirriki (pronounced kee-keerree-kee), A grilled chicken breast with a semi spicy sauce, full of flavor.  My daughter had the fajitas and while there were no surprises here with the entree, the real surprise was with the tortillas, they did not have the texture and flavor of store bought, these actually had the texture and flavor of freshly made.  Taking a step backward, the servers brought out the obligatory chips and salsa, the salsa was flavorful and spicy, overall it was good.  The surprise here was a small bowl of refried beans came out as well to dip chips in, a nice touch.  The service was very prompt, courteous and we never waited or had to ask for anything.  Now, to be fair, the restaurant was semi busy for a Tuesday night but not overwhelming.  Overall, I am planning on going back on my next trip to the city in April."}
{"text":"A mixed review here. The food was superb, but the service had problems.    This is a large place and easy to spot from the road. On entering the Mexican cantina atmosphere is recreated well. Just by the entrance is a small open room where senoritas are hand rolling stacks of fresh tortillas to be sent into the kitchen,.    We were seated immediately by the Maitre'D and our Margharita orders were taken and delivered very promptly.    After a short while a young waiter came to our table. His english was really poor and he either didn't understand or didn't know the answer to any of our questions about the menu. He brought over another waiter with slightly better english who we asked the same questions of. The reason we had so many questions is that my wife cannot eat food with any hot chillies in. She comes with me to mexican and Indian restaurants because they are my 2 favorite foods, but usually she can find something on the menu that she will enjoy.    Anyway the first course was a tortilla soup that was included with all meals. Delicious.    Then I had a combination platter of Beef & Bean Burrito, Cheese Enchilada and 2 Tacos. Again Delicious.    The dish that my wife had made sure had no chillies in came to the table coveres in a hot salsa! Obviously we sent it back with the waiter.    When, 15 mins later, I was nearly finished and no replacement had arrived I called the waiter and it turned out he had just taken back the dish without ordering a replacement without Salsa.    After this I insisted on speaking to the Manager, who was very apologetic and sorted my wife's meal out but it is hardly ideal to go out to dinner with someone and find yourselves eating 30 mins apart!    Like I said at the top, great food but it needs to sort out the service side before I come back. Especially as there are hardly a shortage of great mexican restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"If I  could give Zero stars I would! Myself,My husband and son, with two of our friends came in for dinner  a couple  of months  ago. We  made a reservation and Sat for damn near an hour! Seeing how it was a Friday night. We finally get to a table and waited and waited and waited some more, 45 minutes to be exact, Our waiter finally shows up, takes  our drink order and we wait another 15 minutes for that to come. IT  takes Another 45 to put in our food order. I asked  my waiter several times what was taking so long, he couldn't tell me a thing. I  happen to  look over to the bar area , it was a huge wedding party that all the wait staff was catering  to. 2 hours later our food came, half raw ,thrown on a plate and on top of that my son who is five fell asleep at the table and left hungry, we were charged full price for our meal when it should have been comped, they still charged us! Lindo you shit the bed in the worst way, your customers should come first, I and the other 250 people sitting there that night feel the same way, Put off ,highly Pissed and never coming back!"}
{"text":"I gave them a chance ate there twice, both times had to wait and they were not busy. The service sucked the food was worse. Manager was rude. I will drive the extra miles to eat at Benito Michoacan as he makes far superior food a the staff works it real good."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times while visiting Las Vegas . Unfortunately , today was very disappointing. My carne asada tacos were so bland and the rice and beans so ordinary that I could'nt believe it. My wife's  vegetable fajitas were greasy and unappealing. Clearly this restaurant is doing what other top rated Mexican restaurants are guilty of: get popular, raise your prices and fail at the quality of food served. What a shame. Also, the organic margarita priced at $13 was ridiculous. Sorry guys, I'm done with you. Good tacos, cold beer and no inflated pretenses will get my endorsement. By the way, service was poor. The server barely spoke to us and never came back during the meal."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican restaurant in town. Love to come here and bring out of town guests for the great food and amazing views of the valley. Can't go wrong with the nachos and margaritas. Fish tacos also delic."}
{"text":"Bad service bad food over priced wont come back to this place 45 minutes wait cold food manager answer sorry have to wait 15 minutes more"}
{"text":"I think this has the best Mexican food in Las Vegas.  I've been here many many times.  I like the food because it represents authentic mexican food.  The servers are always very friendly and attentive and the food has never disappointed.  And the margaritas...yummm! Don't forget to try to pina colada.    I want to tell you my favorite dish here, however I can't choose just one.  The tableside guacamole is amazing, and cool to watch them make it fresh.  The shrimp ceviche is great.  Fajitas, fish tacos, flautas, carne asada, burritos...yep its all good.  And what I really dig is that they don't throw black olives, iceberg lettuce, shredded cheese and sour cream on top of everything like many other \"Mexican\" restaurants.  Another cool thing is the live music.  I think its on weekend nights there is a guy singing traditional spanish songs.  Love Love Love Lindo Michoacan."}
{"text":"Me and my wife stopped in on the recommendations of yelp. I would just like to say thank you!  I have not found this authentic flavor in Tennessee yet.   We had the brunch with margaritas and buffet. I usually don't like either, but t his was spectacular.   I had the goat with rice, beans and rice. My wife had the chicken with rice. The only thing I did not like was the tripe soup but that was because of the tripe not the flavor. Everything was delicious.   Make sure you check it out if you get a chance."}
{"text":"Before heading back to L.A we wanted to have lunch and we wanted Mexican food. We didn't want to go to the strip so we found this place thru yelp.. Everything from  the decor to the people that work there is great.. The service is exceptional... Your drink is not even half way when someone is already replacing it.. Food is great, very good portions. They place chips, beans and salsa while ur seating down deciding what to order. We ask for the guacamole n ohh it's fresh n so delicious you can't stop eating it. You got to try this place.. Whenever I'm in Vegas, I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"The overall experience was much better at the Dessert Inn location. I have been there several times & was never disappointed, today's trip to the flamingo location has been sub par. The server Carlos, is a pain in the u know what. If you can avoid having him serve your table, do so. If you need to identify him without reading name tags, he's the guy with the Long Sleeve Dress Shirt that's too small & short in the arms, has his eyebrows arched.He has the attitude too match the above mentioned f*** Boy attributes."}
{"text":"This place is really good. The service is great, the seating is comfortable and has bar and TVs. The choriqueso with those homemade flour tortillas is just amazing! The salsa and bean dip are great with the chips. The habanero salsa is decent. I like that they have fideo soup before the meal it just give you that nostalgic feeling from your childhood. The entr√©es are very good but not great, that is what keeps my review at 4 stars and not 5. I had the Carne Asada and I could say I had better. Like I said very good, not great. The service, the place and the appetizers 5 stars the entr√©es just 4."}
{"text":"Food was alright what I like they gave appetizer first some chips and beans and the soup I ordered the Assad burrito and was delicious just the fact the they took a lil bit of time to bring our food but other than that is a cool place"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. Live the fresh hand made tortillas. I gave it 4 stars because parking is always a hassle. They seemed to have outgrown their land space, which is both a good and bad problem for them. Expect wait times often between 15-20 mins."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Vegas. You wont regret it. Breakfast, lunch and dinner. This is our third time Coming here, I wish they have locations in Socal."}
{"text":"Location, Location, Location! This restaurant has an amazing view of Las Vegas, I would recommend going at night as you can clearly see the Stratosphere and the Luxor Light. Perfect for date night or family dinner.   The staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcomed. What I love is that they always give my son sopa de fideos, noodle soup in a tomato broth. Chips, salsa and beans are given complimentary, which is a plus. I hate when Mexican restaurants charge you for chips and salsa.  The food is OK, not amazing, however the service and view are what really make this place stand out."}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday, the fish tacos were amazing!  I'm not even sure what the chicken dish we had, but it had a green cream sauce and it was also amazing.  The chips and bean dip are very tasty, we will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I would give it 3.5 stars but it will not let me. I ordered the fish tacos and they were okay but the tortilla fell apart.  And the fish lacked some sort of pop flavor (pepper, lemon or something)  The chips and salsa were okay, they didnt look homemade and you inly get one bowl. I have never been to a mexican restaurant were they charge after the first bowl.  My husband ordered the fajitas and it was good   The one thing that I would give a huge compliment is to the workers. From the greeter to the server and the waiter. Everyone was extremely nice, friendly and fast"}
{"text":"Went tonight with children and grandchildren. One thing going for it was the service, which was good. Restaurant was load had trouble talking with each other. Consensus at our table was that our entrees lacked flavor. My chicken dish was bland and the chicken breast was dry. Liked location and view of the strip, but I'll try another Mexican resteraunt next time we are in town."}
{"text":"What can you say about Lindo that hasn't been said. I have never had a bad meal here. Ive been to the other, newer, fancier locations but find this one the best! Look out for the Cadillac Margaritas, though! They go down easy but if you have more than one standing up isn't so easy!  I have been going for years, have had pork, beef, chicken, seafood and have simply never been less than completely satisfied!"}
{"text":"I miss my TexMex and this place is so close to perfecting it. I love their food, the staff and the attitude of this place. So glad it is close to my hood! The only thing I would change is to add queso and get thinner chips!! Otherwise...YumScrum!"}
{"text":"Tried various locations of Lindo around town, just not impressed. Just standard fare, with inflated prices."}
{"text":"I've decided after my first meal here that table-side guacamole making is an important life skill that everyone should have. Like learning to drive a stick shift. Or knowing how to replace an air conditioning filter. When you're two Asians and two gringos in a Mexican restaurant, you know you're doing something right when even the Latinos around you are ordering the table-side guacamole.   I got the 3-taco plate and opted to get one each of carne asada, lengua, and al pastor rather than getting three of just one type of meat as the menu listed. The al pastor was so awesome - sweet and juicy, but the carne asade and lengua were both on the blander side.   I'd come back though - tacos are tough to perfect, especially when everyone feels like they've found the Fountain of Tacos out of their coworker's neighbor's abuela's cousin's pickup truck in the garage and no longer see the value of paying a premium at a sit down restaurant. The menu here is extensive, and I definitely saw a lot of items that caught my eye for a next visit. On top of that, the service is genuine; you don't have to habla espanol to have the servers be at your every beck and call."}
{"text":"Came to eat here a while back. I think it was a Wednesday night. It was so packed! I was thinking that this place had to be hot stuff for it to be that packed on a Wednesday night...  The food was great & the customer service was excellent. They forgot an order for one of the kids which sucked but it wasn't my kid, so I'm not holding that against them. Lol I came with a party of like 16 ppl so I wasn't expecting everything to be perfect. But it was pretty much close to it.  The plates are very large & my food was amazing. The waiters were amazing. They always came by to check to see if we wanted more refills. My husband wanted his food a particular way & they made sure that it came out that way. I can see what the big fuss is about."}
{"text":"We decided to go there yesterday after reading all the reviews and since we have never been there. We went there at 6 pm and were told that we would have a 15-20 min wait. We were OK with it. So we waited and waited. Our party had to wait for 35-40 min before we got our table. It was really frustating. After getting our table, our experience with the food was not any better. It took us around 45 min to get our food from the time we ordered and we just nibbled on the chips and salsa. No one came to ask if we needed more salsa or bean dip (our bean dip was empty). The chips were not freshly fried (not warm). Anyway, the food was just OK. I would not pay the price to go and eat there again. The food was just OK. The rice and beans tasted like out of a can. The only good thing about this place is the view of the strip.  Really wanted to like it, came home very disappointed."}
{"text":"We had a bachelorette party there on 11/13/14 with a party of 13. Living out of town wasn't sure how the restaurant would be.    Needless to say we had excellent service, food and of course the drinks! They even gave each of us a free margarita and shots of tequila to the Bride to Be. We were also driven back to our hotels in their large van. Amazing night!!! We will definitely be back!!! Thank you so much."}
{"text":"Well where do I start?   Service started out great. Even when the food was taking a bit long our waiter Noe came over and apologized and was very attentive.   The food was ok. The pre-meal chips, beans and salsa had me excited about the meal. The margarita wasn't as strong as it should have been given it's large size but it was good.   Our meal WAS going great until the large party arrived. This wasn't your average large party. No they brought little children approximately 8. Like between the ages of 2 and 6. Now I like children and can have patience when needed, within a certain limit. But when a child begins screaming, running and the parent is not even trying to control said child? But now remember I said children. At first it was just a little annoying, \"what's the sound interrupting my thoughts\" kind of annoying. But once you are aware of one screaming child it seems to amplify as the seconds go by.   Interestingly enough we realized that the parties around us were starting to become annoyed. Then the wait staff, all fidgety and and looking annoyed yet too uncomfortable to say anything, avoiding eye contact with us as if hoping by ignoring the noise it would just stop. I began to channel my friend Brianna with the occasional \"stop it!\" getting a good laugh out of my fam but it wasn't enough to make us forget about the banshee noises coming from the other room. Needless to say I could take it no longer and asked our waiter to ask the manager to please say something.   As I suspected they were too afraid to say anything. I can understand not wanting to upset a large group especially when most plates are over $10 as I have been a server and work in the service industry. However when you have children running from room to room and adults chasing them like they are wild chickens, you might want to attempt to control the situation. However the manager and Noe did come over to apologize and offer us free dessert. We couldn't be mad at him, after all you can't really control other people and their children. It wasn't his fault that they had no home training. He even bussed our table and hand delivered the dessert.   Back to the food, I had the Cimichanga de Camarones (shrimp) and a cheese enchilada. The enchilada had more flavor than my chimichanga but deep fried tortilla... My aunt had two tacos, one chicken and one beef. She said that they were missing \"the grease\" lol. She even put the spicy salsa on them to add extra flavor.   My mom and sis had no complaints they had fajitas and a chicken dish.  Free dessert or not a spoon should always be offered with ice cream. Especially when it's yummy chocolate cake and vanilla!   All in all we could have a great experience and should have been able to enjoy good food, drinks and conversation but unfortunately the evening was sullied by wild children and oblivious parents. We can't fault the manager on duty because the owners probably don't train proper etiquette on how to control potential bad situations.   Would we return? Maybe but not anytime soon. There's too many options in this city and to be honest we've had better Mexican food. I'm looking forward to my leftovers (in front of the couch with no screaming children) though!"}
{"text":"Great food. Outstanding service! They clearly work as a well coordinated team. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Heard so many good reviews of this place, welllll let me tell you first of all don't use Postmates to order, everything was ice cold, not warm. Now onto Lindo, the food was awful, carne asada was shoe leather, missing sour cream, jalape√±os, salsa and the list goes on to the tune of 86,00. No more Lindo or Postmates."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great dine in atmosphere. Friendly service. This is authentic and a must if you can get off the strip. I got the carne asada burrito. Delicious."}
{"text":"Mmmm mommy-do dinners at Lindo.  The fideo soup makes me miss my husband a little less :)"}
{"text":"Excellent everything.  The soup they serve with the chips at the start of each meal is true comfort food, and their seafood options are top-notch."}
{"text":"I live in Henderson and this is one of my absolute favorite spots. Great view overlooking the city and if you go on a weekday night you may have the opportunity to sit next to the window to get the best view. (Great place for a romantic date to kiss while overlooking the crazy city life happening beneath you). Not sure why this place doesn't already have five stars or more because the food, drinks, view and service are superb!  I was lucky enough to witness a birthday song and dance accompanied by a sombrero hat for the birthday girl at the table right behind me!!  What a great night!!!"}
{"text":"1)Complimentary bean dip..bland. 2)Salsa too spicy..but not in a good way. 3)Worst taco 'salad' ever. If you consider only ICEBERG(gag) lettuce, refried beans, and choice of bland meat a salad. The pico, cheese, sour cream n guac all could fit in a tablespoon.  Frozen food style meals.  I've had better Mexican food at Cafe Rio.  4) At least the view made the visit not a total waste."}
{"text":"Good place for gringos.... No apto para mexicanos.   Comida desabrida, precios no para la calidad que sirven.  Aguas frescas de maquina!!! Osea no mamen!  Pinche lugar tan bonito y no pueden hacer una agua fresca bien???  Yo pedi plato de carnitas a la coca cola, me trajeron un mole sabor quemado con carne hervida y sin chiste.  Hasta la sopa de fideo desabrida, les pesa la sal yo creo...  Definitely a good place for Gringos!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious home made Mexican food :) yummy I'll definitely recommend to anyone in town"}
{"text":"Best mexican food in Las Vegas! Friendly and attentive staff and the margaritas are awesome!"}
{"text":"Okay, all you gringos. If you're used to middle of the road, chain Mexican food places, and get freaked out at the thought of anything deviating from that path, this place might be a bit too authentic for you. But, if you've been to Mexico, love the real stuff, and might even venture from the enchilada and burrito safe haven, this restaurant has your name on it. It's clean, bright and beautiful, very comfortable, very family friendly, and completely delicious. It has the requisite burritos and tacos and enchiladas, but it has so much more, for those who crave it. Great service, very friendly staff. After ten minutes on our first visit, my wife turned to me and said, \"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant ever.\" Mine, too."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Some items were better than others. Milanesa was a little soggy and bland. The cheese in the enchiladas wasn't melted all the way. Guacamole was delicious and made to order at the table. Steak and lobster was also very well-prepared. The sauce that was used for the birria was a little over-whelming, but the meat was very tender and flavorful. Our server, Erick, was excellent. Very friendly, welcoming, and attentive. Overall, I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Not the worst Mexican food I've ever had, but far from the best.  I've eaten at this particular location several times, and the best food I've eaten has been no better than mediocre.  The chile verde sauce tastes too much like tomatillo and too little like chile verde. The enchiladas seem more like an overcooked casserole than flavorful, stuffed tortillas. The chile relleno may be their best \"traditional\" Mexican dish though it is very bland. Finally, on the food side, the tacos--at least those served at lunch--lack tomato and onion. They're stuffed with meat, lettuce, a smattering of tasteless orange cheese--and that's it: no tomato, no onion. I can get a more satisfying and better filled taco at a fast-food joint for less money,  Now, as to their \"famous Margeritas.\" The only reason these could be famous is for the poor quality at the astounding price: a base-price blended Margarita, which looks and tastes like little more than a lime slushy costs $8.00. Coyote Cantina on Sunset serves much better Margaritas for the same or less money, especially for the lunch special.  I give this place two stars mainly for the spectacular view., The Margaritas merit no stars, the food one star, and, maytbe, the service two stars, if the people would smile more often, though perhaps they've tasted the food"}
{"text":"This was our second time visiting and our second time absolutely loving it.  The view is incredible, the food is even better.  Our waiter was quick and delightful and our drinks were never empty.  The staff is so very attentive and friendly, which is appreciated.  I wanted one of the waiter work with a very large group to get some flowers that they had brought, into some vases and on their table for their occasion.  It was very heart warming.  Love this place and plan to return every year when we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Best place in Las Vegas for REAL mexican food.  By Far. Everything is freash and the service is the best."}
{"text":"My family eats here every couple months. Their food is very delicious, authentic Mexican and the service is usually above par.  It only got 3 stars from me because of the price. Mexican food is typically cheap to make and I have a pretty big family, so when we are feeling like good Mexican food, it's hard to cough up $50-$60 to feed all of us! I think they could be more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"So, I waited for about a week to write this review and this is why.  It was my best friend's graduation and to celebrate we went to this location, it was my first time and she highly recommended it. I ordered the Mole Pablano and the Chile Relleno, both were very good. I have not tried any mole dishes before but since this is, as what the others described it as \"authentic,\" I guess it was not a bad place to try my first mole. With the live music and Mexican decoration, and the sporadic \"birthday\" or \"congratulatory\" chants, gives this restaurant a unique Mexican experience that I have not yet experience. But let's get down to why I am giving Lindo Michoacan \"3-stars.\"   Although I value the quality of food very highly, I also value service. It was a busy weekend, but I can't really say whether or not it is a \"normal\" weekend for them. We had a big group, a part of about 20, and we had one waiter. I was one of the last guests to arrive and the waiter was getting everyone's drinks, I had a slight hesitation when he asked me and before I know it, he already was on the next guest. He also kept going back to me asking me, very sternly, if I was ready to order, wanting me to make a decision. After the third time, I said I was ready, but mind you, he wasn't really taking any order, he just wanted to know if we were ready. At this point, I was already peeved. And, he also managed to annoy half of our party. One of our party had a specific order and this was repeated 3x, twice in English and once in Spanish. When his order came, he was surprised that it was wrong. He pointed this out to our server and our server told him they can scoop it out for him or hand him a spoon to do it himself. After some deliberation, he gave the plate back and said he does not want the food anymore. At this point, the server called him an \"a-hole\" in Spanish, NOT KNOWING HE IS FLUENT IN SPANISH! The manager was called and talked to our friend and only then when this server came over to \"personally apologize.\" I do not believe it was sincere at all since he only have done so since he got caught! There was no compensation, that I was aware of the same server kept serving us. I was not happy about his service and wished we did not leave any tip/gratuity towards him. I would have left it to the bus boys.   Big question, will I go back? I would only go back if a friend, who also speaks Spanish, wanted to go. Don't get me wrong, I guess this is an isolated incident and the other staff are welcoming."}
{"text":"This was my second time here. My first experience was great but this time around, not so much.I asked the waiter what is the difference between Al Ajillo and Al Mojo de Ajo, he answered that it is the same thing, that it was just a misprint on the menu. He said its just garlic salt, pepper and a little spice. So I ordered a steak with shrimp al mojo de Ajo but when i received the plate it was covered in a wine sauce. A wine sauce that was supposed to be reduced but instead was watery.The waiter never even mentioned it had wine and there was so much it ruined the meat, rice, etc. My husband let the waiter know of our disappointment but we never received an apology from him. We did receive great service from other staff members but that isn't enough to make me go back to this restaurant. People do seem to enjoy the atmosphere here but I prefer to enjoy my food and this place couldn't do that for me."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have the best service in Las Vegas, their environment is awesome with great views of the strip, and I always leave here feeling joy. The atmosphere is so fun and lively. The food is good, not amazing, but pretty good. The drinks are also great too! Definitely love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food and staff. at a very decent price.  Every staff member had a smile on their  face.  Live music on Tuesday night was a nice suprise. Staff gave special attention to our grandson who soaked it all in.  Combine the food, price and staff and this one is hard to beat....in my top five of all time!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here while on a road trip and all loved it. The service was exceptional and the food was tasty. Their bean dip that they serve with chips is AMAZING. I had their enchiladas, which I didn't care for, but everyone else loved their food.  I just have to praise the staff: a hostess was by the door, opening it for everyone who came and went. It was 112 outside, and pretty warm inside as well, but the waiters were running around and working hard to make sure that everyone had everything. Like I said, the service was exceptional.  The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because both my step-mom and I felt sick that night, and the food from this restaurant was the only thing I ate all day. However, I was fine the next day.  I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place has the best quality  food.  No matter what we order our meal is delicious. ."}
{"text":"This is my favorite mexican restaurant in all of Las Vegas.  They have a great view of the Las Vegas valley (can be a nice dinner date).  They have excellent service, very quick.  Food is always great.  Never had a bad experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Always great for a quick, cheap lunch. Service is fast. We wanted a good lunch before a movie at gvr and didn't want fast food. Went here and was fed and out the door in a half an hour. Lunch specials are fantastic, my favorite is the green chile pork and bean burrito."}
{"text":"Good food, good service and the margaritas were good just as advertised!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have ever tasted in the U.S!! There were so many options it was so hard to choose! My family is originally from Michoac√°n and if you have ever visited, it's true we do have the best antojitos around! The food and drinks were awesome! I fell in love with the decor of this place too.   The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars was because our waiter was so sarcastic it wasn't even funny! We just had some questions because one of my friends is vegetarian and he was being rude. The bus boy on the other hand was more helpful at answering our questions.   A little ways off the strip but well worth the drive! The carnitas were finger licking good and I usually hate the beans at restaurants but I finished all of them. Oh and you can't beat the tasty handmade tortillas. I will defiantly come back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Really good food at reasonable prices. Huge portions and a very attentive wait staff.  We didn't have reservations, but were seated within just a few minutes (on a Friday night).  We got there moments before the dinner crowd swarmed through the front door.  Another plus is they don't water down their margaritas like most other places do.  I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 solely because of the off-key singer in the live entertainment."}
{"text":"Went here for Easter Sunday.  Had the buffet and was very good.  I was very impressed by how clean and organized everything was kept.  They were constantly replenishing.  I am married to a mexican and grew up eating lots of mexican food and there were still several things I did not recognize.  I will be going back again."}
{"text":"Only reason I've gave them 2 stars is cause the view was nice & our second server Rene was caring and attentive!  Our first server was rude and looked like he didn't want to be there I felt discriminated cause we were a young couple half way down our meal he stopped coming around and i saw him and another worker standing and pointing at our table laughing ! After that he just stopped checking on us I stopped Rene and he helped us the remainder of our dinner. Food was bad and our anniversary dinner was ruin"}
{"text":"Awesome place!! I reserved a private space for about 45 people to celebrate my grandma's 88th birthday. It was great! No extra charge for the reservation and private area!! Food was delicious as always. My family enjoyed everything. We went on a Saturday at 7pm; they had a live mariachi who sang \"las mananitas\". I also took a cake and they placed it in their fridge until we were ready to cut it. Great experience!!"}
{"text":"The Best Mexican Restaurant in Henderson.  I ordered Pastor taco. The best tasting fish taco I eat.e BEST"}
{"text":"I have been here several times over the past two years, and although I like the food and service, I had a bad experience last week. It was happy hour, and I asked if they had discount appetizers. They told me they didn't, but it was two for one on the margearitas, which I ordered. Thinking back to the times I had ordered margaritas in the past, I figured they were good. Wrong!  I'm wondering if they use a cheap tequila in the two for one drinks, because it was awful!  When I want mexican food, I also want a good margarita. I think they need to use better tequila.  Even though this is a few blocks from my house, I will be going to Viva Mercado for a much better margarita next time."}
{"text":"Well I was very disappointed,especially after hearing this place had been in this location for 25 years. My carne asada burrito was anything but authentic. Instead of marinated shredded beef it had bits of beef that had been way over cooked. You could chew and chew and nothing would happen. I suggest that you stick to Chevy's. My wife's enchilada was so salty she couldn't eat it. Oh ya, drinks are way overpriced too."}
{"text":"So I'm super picky when it comes to Mexican food. But in Vegas this is my Favorite spot. Went here for my first time a few days ago and was impressed. The outside is big, beautiful and traditional looking. The Servers and Hostesses where dressed in traditional clothing. ( Love it!) The Inside is decorated like a Fiesta. Love the atmosphere- everyone that took care of us was great, attentive and had great conversation with us. And as if that wasn't enough the food and drinks were Great! The portion sizes and flavor was perfect. Couldn't have been happier with our experience here. So worth the drive off the strip.."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food. What more can I say? Just that I wish there was one in Orange County CA."}
{"text":"Celebrated birthday dinner on a Friday night. Chips were not fresh, salsa and beans were blan/no taste. Service was not too good, water was not refilled.  All in All, was not happy with the service or the food on this special occasion.  Will not return."}
{"text":"We had dinner here, party of eight. The couple had been here before, claiming everything is great! It wasn't, the service was terrible, had to wait for our orders to taken, had to wait along time for our orders to be delivered, had to hunt  for refills and then waited a long time for the check.  Food,$$, the avocado dip was very bad, very strong taste of onions, the avocados were very bland. I ordered the beef taco combo plate, it was very plane, not the taste you paid for.My wife had beef on skewer, the taste was fine, until she found a very small chrome ring, about 1/8in. in size mixed into the meat, they didn't charge for her meal.  The couple that had been here before, had to add bowls of chilli sauce to make it taste good.  Food at a fast food stand tasted a whole lot better, and at a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! We came here for dinner and it was packed but the service was still excellent. They give you a house soup that's soo yummy! I come here every time I'm in Vegas, great Mexican food. A little pricier than most Mexican restaurants both worth it."}
{"text":"Me and my wife are from Texas where Mexican food is king so it's safe to say we have had our share. Lindos is as good as any we have ever had however what truly sets this restaurant apart is the attention to detail by the staff the little army of workers meeting every demand is awesome  We will always come here when we are in Vegas"}
{"text":"Not bad, but I won't come back. Service was nice, but we had to ask for half the items we ordered twice.  Margarita was watered down, didn't taste like lime or Tequila, it was very watery. There was also almost no salt inn the rim. Fajitas were ok, but almost no veggies like other places. No cheese or fresh tomatoes either. The others in our party asked for their fajitas well done, and they weren't. The guacamole was excellent, refried beans and salsa was also yummy.  Too bad, we were really looking forward to the food. Very disappointing over all."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant. My family and I always go here. Everything I've had here has been delicious! The enchiladas suizas are one of my favorites, very distinct flavor. The servers are all very nice, the mariachi is great. Overall one of the best in vegas!"}
{"text":"Staff is freindly and service was good. Food portions are large. I had the steak fajitas which were pretty good. Great views of Vegas from the bar. If you're looking for good Mexican with fun atmosphere in Henderson this is a great option.."}
{"text":"This review is based upon the experience of my girlfriend and I as we tried Lindo Michoacan. We arrived around 8:30 for a late dinner, so our experience may not be reflective of lunch or earlier dinner services.   Front of the House: Approaching the restaurant there were many cars parked along the road but the parking lot had a couple spots open. On our way to the front door (it was rather loud) and when the doors opened it become nearly uncomfortably loud. There was some live music while a cow bell was being rung to celebrate someone's birthday. While it appeared to be rather busy, we were seated quickly. The table we were brought to had no placemats out and the hostess put those on while we watched, but only a spoon and fork for utensils, no knives. The service started off poor service. On a positive note, the napkins, while not cloth, are thick and large, certainly of higher quality than many other restaurants. The service improved slightly through dinner but remained below average and certainly below expectations. The attire of the wait staff gives a mixed message. The hostesses (only female) were wearing \"traditional Mexican dresses\" while the waiters (did not see a single female waiter) were more mixed. About 2/3 of them were wearing semi-formal attire, button up long sleeve dress shirts with ties, some in white and some in all black which itself gave different impressions. However, the remaining one-third wore pants with t-shirts advertising the restaurant which portrayed a much less formal atmosphere.  The restaurant itself is very open which only increases the ambient volume. Part of the kitchen is open which is appealing and informative. One side of the dining room is covered with a glass wall with a beautiful view of the Las Vegas valley. While waiting to be seated one can watch the cook staff make flour tortillas through the open kitchen, however, the tortillas are being rolled out with a rolling pin instead of by hand which is traditional. The kitchen area was clean and generally well organized. The anti-skid mats were a bit unevenly placed leaving some spaces of open floor where staff could slip.  Food: Tortilla Chips with Chile Salsa and Refried Bean Dip: Shortly after we were seated arrived some tortilla chips with chile and refried bean dips. Disappointingly, the chips were at room temperature rather than heated and even moreso the bean dip was incredibly bland. One might think the mellow bean dip would go well with a hot and spicy chile sauce, however, the lack of flavor in the bean dip make for a dissatisfying combination. (Notably, the refried beans that came with the entree were significantly more enjoyable and flavorful, as will be addressed later). The chile salsa appeared mostly chunky with some oil floating on the surface. The appearance and aroma were not particularly out of the ordinary, but neither were particularly remarkable. The flavor seemed incredibly lackluster, no notable hint of spices aside from the chiles themselves were present, to the point where there was almost no taste. There was the expected after effect of heat but that is all there was, pure heat. If you happen to be a fan of hotter chiles, the mild heat will be the final disappointing aspect of the complimentary appetizer. Quesadilla de Ma√≠z con Carne: The appetizer came plated with two small, 5 to 6 inches in diameter, both cut into 4 unequal pieces, additionally there, was some guacamole and sour cream provided. The corn tortillas tasted the same as previous I have had and were very similar to Guerrero brand tortillas but were much less uniform than mass-produced kinds. The Monterey Jack used was of nice quality and lent a very savory, yet mildly sweet quality to the the enchiladas. The steak was lightly seasoned which should have let the meaty flavor stand on its own. However, the lower quality of the meat combined with incredibly different sizes of the cut lead to a very uneven cooking, that could only be described as overdone, relegated the steak to more a texture, rather than taste. Sopa de Fideos/Fideo Soup: My girlfriend first described the soup as \"tomato water with oil,\" which after trying it repeated seems to be a succinct yet accurate description. The red soup lacks a strong aroma and one is immediately drawn to the large amount of oil along the top. There is a slight suggestion of tomato and earthy flavors but they are very diluted. The short vermicelli were the most tasteful part of the soup; very soft with a nice doughy taste.   A significant reduction in the liquid combined with just a bit of salt and some onion/garlic would have made for a much more flavourful soup.   Cont."}
{"text":"Goat. I'm just sayin'. This off-the-strip Mexican marvel will definitely help you keep your drink on, and offer lots of yummy and interesting options to help absorb the booze."}
{"text":"We used to go to Lindo all the time back when it was a real Mexican restaurant, now its the Denny's of Mexican. the food is so commercialized and bland, it is no longer authentic and the quality went down hill and the prices went up. I will no longer be a patron after my last visit. first we sat at the bar to wait for our table and the bartender told us we can get half off if we text some number to vote lindo the best of Las Vegas, that's cute, however we cant vote if we just sat down and haven't had a drink or food yet? how do we know if its the best. that was unpleasant.  Sorry lindo your food is not good any more, nor your prices. the one star is for the attentiveness of your servers."}
{"text":"First time here and it was great. Ordered the chilaquiles plate and I split it with my wife, I didn't even have to ask the server for an extra plate they did the split on the kitchen. Taste was great to. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"First time eating here at this restaurant.  We had seen a show in food network that show cased a spicy ghost salsa.  We had to stop and try it. For those who like spicy food this is a must try.   We tried the Buey de cilantro, aguachile, chilaquiles, queso fundido, taco dorados, torta and table side  guacamole and hand made tortillas. Everything was delicious and service was great.    Es un buen lugar para celebrar un cumplea√±os ya que te cantan y te dan tu tequilazo cumpleanero.     Definitivamente recomendamos este restaurante y ser√° unos de nuestros lugares favoritos en las Vegas."}
{"text":"My wife ordered chicken enchiladas and they came out as cheese enchiladas with a big grilled chicken breast sitting on top.  She tried to send it back but they said this is how they are.  I have never seen chicken enchiladas like that.  It was if someone was to lazy to shred the chicken and put it inside the enchilada.  We have never been back."}
{"text":"Ok this was my first visit to an establishment OTHER than my doctors office as a handicapped person. So I am giving them 5 stars based on a few reasons. First the hostess saw me coming in on my knee scooter with my big boot/cast thing and she immediately grabbed the door for me, Then She sat my sister and I at the closest table with an easy access to get in and out of a chair. I was starving after my doctor's appointment and this was my first time getting to eat out since I have been out with my foot problem.   The bus boy helped me get situated and helped me get my scooter under the table. Then he took our drink order and brought my iced tea and chips and salsa.  I ordered a chimichanga and my sister ordered the tacos .   Bonus: they have like 32 lunch specials. So you have a ton of different combinations to like order from.   We ordered the fresh guacamole YUM. I could barely eat though .. But everything I had was delicious. I had it wrapped up because I KNEW that leftovers would be awesome.   My busboy .. kept my glass filled, and helped me get my food into cartons.   It was extremely exhausting to be out after being on bedrest for the last 5 weeks, so I did not do desert and it was good to go home.   But I definitely will be back it was a great time."}
{"text":"Love this place and so far every dish I have had there. The staff is great and very sweet. It has a great view and love the drinks. I like it realy spicy so be sure to ask for a side of the Habanero salsa. Yum scrum!!"}
{"text":"After years of frequenting this restaurant at the Desert Inn location where I never had a bad experience, my girlfriend and I opted to try the one in Henderson on Valentine's Day.  Fortunately we arrived before the rush and were promptly seated by a very friendly staff.  We immediately received chips and salsa along with requested water. The menu is nothing short of overwhelming, but in a positive way.  Talk about selection and variety.  Everything sounded good but ultimately we made our selections (one steak entree, one chicken entree) which arrived in a timely manner, despite how busy it was.  Our server was friendly and attentive and they always kept my glass full of water.  Both of us completely finished our plates and the taste of the food was totally wonderful.  Even their tortillas were full of flavor.  Overall we had a truly wonderful dinner with top notch service and the view of the city from inside is spectacular.  Upon our departure, the line for seating was out the door - obviously this is a very popular establishment.  I cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"This place is a joke, we order carnitas and they had no flavor at all. We also order the lamb stew and its tasted like tomatoes juice, with no flavor. These are very traditional dishes with bold flavors but they missed the mark. The only thing I enjoyed was the habanero sauce I asked for to try to cover the bland taste of the food although the sauce itself was bland. If your looking for authentic this is not the place and top of it its overprice. Save your time and money and go to a mom & pop shop. (Service is excellent)"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. A wide variety of mexican dishes. Pretty authentic except for the lima beans in my burrito. Did not go well with carne asada and cheese :P"}
{"text":"I visited Vegas last June, and my daughter took my wife and I to eat at this restaurant.  AMAZING food!  Not only is the food amazingly tastie, but the view is fantastic.  We loved the hand-made tortillas. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Lindo Michoacan a Mexican restaurant that makes you speak hispanic to your best or try your best, when you are here your world transforms into Mexico, the moment you enter the door the distinctive smell of cilantro chili corn tortillas greet your appetite and palate, if you came in hungry? you will instantly feel deprived of food and your brain will tell you you are starving! the food is authentic and delicious. while you savor the food you can't miss the ambiance and the wall full of picture frames of people and places in Mexico, don't miss their Seviche de camaron, Enjoy it with the tortilla chips and you can say life has been good."}
{"text":"Muy buen lugar,comida buen√≠sima de verdad lo recomiendo.bengo de California.kise buscar un buen lugar de comida mexicana.llegue al indicado."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints for amazing Mexican dishes. Attentive wait staff, great atmosphere, delicious margaritas and tasty food. Don't miss this place!!"}
{"text":"An absolute MUST to see the gorgeous view of Las Vegas at night!  We've been going there at least twice a month for over 3 years.  And the food, service & atmosphere are awesome.  Yes, it gets busy, but WELL worth the wait.  If the place is empty, it's because they're closed (duh)!  Our favorite waiter MANNY is A#1+++.  He always takes excellent care of us!!  And, if you want something other than what's on the menu, they'll make it for you, no problem.   They've accommodated us (unplanned) on numerous occasions with our friends from out of town.  They all get the tshirt \"Save Water Drink Margaritas\" and wear them home on the plane!!   Thank You ALL at Lindo!!  See you soon!   Have a Margarita BullDog & Strawberry Margarita waiting for us.  p.s.--You need more parking lots, it's dangerous crossing Carnegie Rd if you have to park on the road or in the business lot across the street."}
{"text":"Best restaurant  in town,very friendly staff! Waitress  Jose very professional,Food is hands down just the best hand made tortillas ,pretty good portions fast service.My wife and Highly recommend this wonderful place!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot!!!! We were tired of the crappy and expensive food at the Strip and head out to this place. Awesome service, fresh ingredients, and really good food"}
{"text":"I am a longtime resident and used to eat at the original restaurant years ago. When I saw the Lindo Michoac√°n at Carnegie I gave it a try for lunch. I have to say that I loved the food at the original restaurant. Though the restaurant was half empty I was seated at a table without view, which I thought was a bad move. I ordered the Polle en molle, which was forgettable. I am not Mexican and if I make this dish it tastes much better because I make it from scratch.. This one was obviously made with a store bought sauce you can buy at every super market. I will never return. The food was nothing to write home about, the drink was expensive and I got no view."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, servers and bus persons super attentive. Bean dip not as great as their location on Desert Inn.  Tortillas melted like butter in your mouth =)   Entrees:  Carnitas Coca Cola... pork with their own signature sauce that includes coke (warning, kinda has a bitter after taste) great tasting.  Fillet Relleno (large fish fillet stuffed with octopus and salsa) topped with creamy mayo secret sauce....AWESOME!!!! Would have been 5 stars, but bean dip let me down =(  Also had to park elsewhere coz their very small parking lot was full.  Still, awesome place for great Mexican food ."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! The beans are delicious and the salsa is so good! I'm never disappointed here! I love how they always give you chips, salsa, and soup before the meal. Also, the view is so beautiful to see when eating dinner! The staff is always very friendly- best restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"Great food and the views of the city are amazing!! Family members brought me here for my birthday and I thought I may escape the singing but not quite. Free tequila shot if the sing and you wear the hat!!!"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are  delicious.  Fish tacos grilled were some of the best I've ever eaten"}
{"text":"My husband and I each ordered a bowl of menudo and were disappointed. $25 for 2 bowls of menudo - they only offer one size. The size of the bowl did not match the quantity of actual menudo. There is no hominy in their menudo, which is fine, but the tripe-soup ratio was definitely off. Also, I was really craving an horchata and they said they were all out. Bummer.  The service was fine and the views were spectacular, which is why I gave two stars. I could have gotten a better Menudo at Fausto's down the street for about half the price. I've been here twice, but probably won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"We still enjoy coming to Lindo Michoacan with friends to have a quality Mexican meal. Great chips, beans and salsa. Very tasty margaritas, and whatever meal I have, the food is consistently good.   The music can be a little too loud for me, but just sit in the dining room OR on the patio and you can avoid getting your ear blasted and having to yell at your table mates just to have a conversation. :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the carne asada (medium rare) salad and a strawberry margarita. Both were delicious, and the steak was cooked perfectly. The dressing was light and the greens were not drowning in it. The restaurant was clean, employees were very friendly and nice. The only thing about this restaurant that I found odd was that it was sooo dark. You might want to bring a flashlight to read the menu. My dad ordered the chimichanga, my mom ordered one of the combinations and my boyfriend ordered the orange roughy.  They used quality ingredients and everyone liked what they ordered. There's lots of parking in the back. It doesnt really matter to me whether they serve authentic Mexican food or not.  The food is good, place is clean, they use quality ingredients, fast and friendly service... Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Awesome. My only regret is that I couldn't finish my meal.  My wife and I were looking to have some Mexican food while we were in town form Toronto. We ran across the reviews for the Original Lindo and we were not disappointed.  We started with the guacamole, which was made to order at our table. Delicious.  Then we each had a tamale. Excellent.  My wife had the Carne Asada tacos and I had the Fillet Relleno. Spectacular.  You just can't get food like this in Toronto.  The service was top rate as well. Everyone was attentive, friendly, and gracious.   If you have the time and don't mind moving off the strip you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place, great food, great drinks, great service. They make the guacamole right in front of you. Although I love the live mariachi band t can be a bit loud."}
{"text":"I could go to Lindo every weekend if my husband would allow it. Be careful thought this place on weekend nights can be 15-45min wait! They do take reservations for large parties and smaller parties if you plan ahead. Once you get seated the service is top notch. Right away you get chips, salsa and beans be careful the salsa does pack some heat. I always order the jumbo frozen margarita and my husband gets jumbo margarita on the rocks both are around $9-$12. We usually start with table side guacamole and fundido with no chorizo. I highly recommend the fundido if you like CHEESE! Every entree comes with a cup of fideo soup to start. My husband and I usually get Shrimp Diabla or Chicken Tia Esther. Both are must try dishes and both come with warm homemade tortillas, beans, rice and guacamole scoop. This place isn't the cheapest but you certainly get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Been here once and was enough for me for not coming back. Had coworkers that didn't want to go anywhere far and chose this establishment for dinner, so I joined even tough I knew wasn't gonna be good. Had the camarones tacos and the quality of the food was so cheap that I couldn't believe how people can offer that. The grilled shrimp were so small and seemed the ones that you microwave. I wish yelp would let us rate half star because that would be more appropriate as rating. Never again!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service and food is always on point!! The lunch specials are just right. Good place for a quick meeting over lunch or a fun date. Love them crunchy shredded beef tacos and giant quesadillas."}
{"text":"good restaurant but not great atmosphere. shrimp ceviche was good. service was average"}
{"text":"My fiance and I met here.  However, when we met it was a very nice Italian restaurant.  We were sad to see the Italian place fail but are pleasantly surprised by the service and food quality of this fairly classy Mexican joint!  The only real negative experience was when I ordered a dish that was a Mexican take on steak.  The cut of steak was not very good with a lot of fat and gristle.  I want to state though that ALL OTHER meals I've eaten there were well above average!  In total, we've eaten here about 8 times.  So just stay away from any steak dishes and you're good to go."}
{"text":"I'm very happy they decided to open another location. Before I needed to drive to the other side of town and while it was well worth it, a shorter drive is always better, if the experience is the same...  And I'm happy to say they have done a great job of bringing a similar experience to the west side of town. They staff is friendly, food consistently excellent and the ambiance feels authentic  (i.e. not like a Denny's with a splash of Mexican paint/art work!). I've already eaten there twice and the Carney dishes are still highly recommended.  The salsa seems a bit different in consistency (very blended) but the taste is the same. I recently tried the fajitas and did not love them. But the fish taco was great (soft, not hard shell!, you'll thank me).  All in all highly recommended, they do not get the five for a few reasons:  1) It was tough for me to find the address of this location. Internet Marketing please!  2) While the newer location is nice, it just doesn't have the feel of the Desert Inn location.  3) I have never been to Lindo and not heard at least one person be wished happy birthday by the staff. I haven't heard this at the new location.  I think Lindo Michoacan has an excellent management team. Never met them, just judging on how the business is run and the feel from the staff. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Lindo Michoacan is the best Mexican Restaurant in Las Vegas. The food and service are excellent. I've noticed the service is not so great on Sunday nights, but on Friday and Saturday nights it is a well run operation. I recommend any of the carne plates. Also, the home made tortillas are incredible! I'm a snob when it comes to Mexican food, trust me this place delivers. I drive across town to eat there."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place. Somehow my last visit here has lowered my expectations. I had the fish tacos and it really did not hit the spot. The prices have gone up and it seems as if the portions and quality has gone down. The chips and salsa are still awesome. Maybe on my next visit I can rekindle my feelings for this place."}
{"text":"We look forward to eating here, every time we go to Vegas.  We love their Fedio and drinks.  Everyone we take their loves their food."}
{"text":"The three stars are for the service, which was excellent. The food was well prepared, but very bland. In disagreement with other reviews, we found the bean dip bland also, not in the same class as Casa Don Juan's. Drinks and food arrived promptly, and served at the proper temperature for the item. We did not experience any problems with noisy kids, and thought the decor appropriate."}
{"text":"Great view, consistently good mexican fare. Great made-to-order guacamole."}
{"text":"Really great fresh food. I love the specialty chicken dishes particularly the chicken mojo ago. Husbands tostada wasn't anything special but burritos are good."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Lindo on desert inn for over 20 years and it is by far my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas! We decided to go to the one on horizon ridge and our waiter Manny was absolutely awesome! He brought soup for our baby before we even ordered drinks! Everyone needs to go here and try the Queso fundido con chorizo and mole enchiladas with carne asana! Ask for manny, he will take care of you!"}
{"text":"We ate here with some friends we met who live in Henderson. The food was good, nothing really bad about it. The fideo soup is basically lipton noodle soup with some tomato juice in it, which I found quite boring. I felt like it wasn't as amazing as I was expecting considering their prices"}
{"text":"the worst Mexican food in Nevada I guess were to far from California where you can get good Mexican food. Their sauces are so bitter with no flavor just bla. The service staff is good. too bad the food wasn't as good as they are good."}
{"text":"The view was great only We didn't go for the view.  We went so my sister whom was visiting could experience some really great Mexican food. My husband and I have on lived in Henderson a few months so I ask where we could some great Mexican food and was told to this restaurant wold be able to fulfill my wish.  Aside from a huge bill be got the worst Mexican food I ever had. I thought will its just what I ordered but no one liked their meal either. My sister was disappointed and I was embarrass. The chicken was so tough you could thrown it for a frisbee. The salad was very large pieces and it had to be cut and had more of the tough chicken on it. There just wasn't anything we liked and definitely not worth price. One and done!"}
{"text":"Great food and super quick food. The only con was that we sat right by the live music so it was pretty loud. They give great chips, salsa and bean dip. Then we got soup with our entrees. All very good."}
{"text":"Brought my brother here for his bday!   I been here twice total and both times the food was really good. We arrived about close to 10 pm and the place was very busy but we were seated quickly. There were a lot of celebrations going on this night, many bdays and a wedding. The staff did a good job of maintaining a good atmosphere by playing music, singing songs, and being very interactive with all customers.   A lot of choices looked very good but I settled with a plate of Chicken Fajitas with flour tortillas. The food was good, nothing I can complain about or really hype. I finished my plate and my drink never went below half way, good service all around."}
{"text":"A friend and I ate here last Friday and our server Luis was absolutely amazing! He was so friendly and offered so many different suggestions"}
{"text":"I want to thank the owners and the staff at mi lindo michoacan for treating us like queens, The contestants and I for the Senorita Mexico Us were here and had such an amazing experience, their food is great, great service and the atmosphere makes you feel like you are truly in mexico... If your in vegas visiting Mi Lindo Michoacan is a must."}
{"text":"Fresh tasting, authentic flavors with some of the best homemade tortillas in town. The service is great, and the price is right especially with a Groupon."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant.  I do not eat a lot of Mexican food but whenever I crave it, this is the place to go.  Service is good and the food is better.  It is quite a massive place but the best place to sit would be the patio side.  The view is breathtaking."}
{"text":"I have seen some pretty bad reviews about this place, but I am not going to be writing one of \"those\". This restaurant left me happy, well fed and highly impressed. I will however point out the few things that may turn certain types of eaters off. First off, it is very loud inside, not just because of the live music (which was upbeat and entertaining, although maybe a little corny at times) but also because this restaurant seems to be very popular, and for good reason! The parking is a little tight too, so I recommend going at a normal dinner time (5 or 6 o'clock), rather than the classic \"8 o'clock\" time that one might normally take a date to dinner. Insignificant gripes aside, Lindo Michoacan is a fantastic restaurant! The servers were attentive, helpful in every way, were happy to help explain the dishes and also accommodating (had one person in my party who had specific needs) in an understanding and respectful manner. The menu is gargantuan, which some people may not like, but I personally appreciate having options. You can go to their website and review the menu in advance if you want to save time.  Now for the food... I was in a party of five, we all had different dishes, everything came fairly quickly and every member of my party made ZERO complaints (believe me, I was with people who would have complained had they had reason to)! Tortilla chips and an assortment of dips were provided very shortly after being seated. Upon request (do so immediately!) they will make guacamole right at your table, I think it was $6 for the guac dip but I tell you it was worth every penny. I cannot speak for my companions' dishes but my dish, the chipotle chicken was cooked perfectly, portioned well and hot damned delicious! But alas, my review has dragged on too long. If you are still reading, please ignore the whiners and nay-sayers. Give this place a try. It is highly unlikely that you will regret it, unless you are one of \"those\" ;)"}
{"text":"My friends call me a child, but I can't help but order a cheese enchilada. Add rice and beans and you have a mess of cheese greatness mixing it together like your mom tells you in not playing with your food. Add the table side guac, live music, and a view of the city and you create a Mexican food masterpiece."}
{"text":"Lindo Michoacan came highly recommended so we stopped in for appetizers and drinks.  This place did not disappoint!  The views looking back into the city were fantastic but our waiter Manny was the star of the show.  Manny was extremely attentive and took care of all our dietary needs (gluten free).  We enjoyed the Organic Margaritas, quesadillas and table side guacamole.  Lindo Michoacan will be on the must visit list next time we're in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place has withstood the economic challenges purely on its reputation. They have quality mexican food, great value, and consistency. This location is by far my favorite, and I try to introduce as many friends to this place as possible. They deserve the business."}
{"text":"Large menu and large portions. The waiter was very helpful and pointed out the best dishes! Everyone working there was friendly and enthusiastic. The atmosphere was authentic and great live music. The cheese covered jalepeno appetizer is a must!"}
{"text":"We've been looking for a good Mexican Restaurant since we moved to Anthem, so we tried this place today. The view is one of the best in the valley, which may explain the high percentage of out-of-state license plates in the parking lot. The service was the best I've had in a long time. The servers were attentive while not being obtrusive. They brought chips, salsa and bean dip and took our drink orders as soon as we sat down and the drinks arrived by the time we started reading the menus. I ordered the Shrimp Chimichanga and my wife had the Carnitas Burrito.  Mine came with some kind of Tomato and Noodle soup that was really good and I had just eaten the last spoonful when the entrees arrived. The portions were huge, we both have plenty left over for lunch tomorrow. My wife commented as we were leaving that she's really glad we've found a great Mexican Restaurant so close to home. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"2 star for the amazing view they have of the entire Las View area. I'm sure it's even more  amazing at night.   Food~ bland as can be!   So disappointed, have been wanting to go there for months.  Lindo Michoacan!! Add some flavor to the food!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. I've been coming here since I was a kid. The food is amazing and the staff is friendly. Drinks are good and tortillas are bomb. Try this place out. Weekends mariachi are there"}
{"text":"Some places are just a part of my experience with this city that I never think I to review them.  That's Lindo. It's part of Vegas' culinary landscape. Established in the early nineties, it's one of a handful of businesses in this town that seems to evolve and grow with the city. They have managed to find new ways to remain relevant and, even current, as the times, and tastes, change.   This place remains a go-to for many for local Mexican food. They are very consistent in the product. The service is always solid and they do a strong job of providing an experience for diners. Touches from the live music to the table side guacamole preparation give this place a customer friendly energy. The staff at Lindo wants you to enjoy yourself. The place will be packed when you go as many locals count Lindo as their top choice for Mexican food. I suspect much of that goodwill is based on the energy and \"excitement\" of the place.  My primary issue is weak flavors and overly tough protein--specifically chicken. Like I said, they're consistent. Dishes like Chile Colorado should be fork tender. They never are. The food has changed some from when I first started coming to Lindo. The flavors seem to have turned down two notches and the delicious dishes that were once \"delicioso\" are now best categorized as \"good\".  But this may only be a problem for me since I hear so many people say they LOVE the dishes at Lindo. I fall more in the category of loving the IDEA of the dishes at Lindo.   The updated, glossy new (as of a few years ago) menu boasts a wealth of options: pork, appetizers, fish, beef, chicken, etc. I have wondered if the effort to expand the menu has led to the decline in the quality of the dishes. On my latest visit I tried the Enchiladas de Mole. It was safe and filling. But in fairness, that's all I was expecting.   There are no layered or even punchy flavors to challenge or excite the pallet. But I don't think that's what Lindo is about. And that's ok.  They provide good food for a reasonable price.   I will continue to pop into Lindo for parties or with large gatherings and I'm glad to see that many people appreciate and frequent this local business."}
{"text":"I don't know if this place is related to the other Michoacan restaurants in town, but if it is, all the others have a very high act to follow. I've been to the one off of Twain on the west side, but this one is even better (and that's saying a lot!).  The staff, to begin with... SUPER FRIENDLY. Our server explained everything on the menu we had questions about and did it with a smile even though it was super busy and noisy on that particular night. Other people who weren't serving our table even stopped to make sure we were okay.  I ordered the chimichanga de camarones (shrimp chimi) and oh my Jesucristo -- que bueno! Flavorful, zesty, and DEFINITELY filling. It is not for the timid eater. You know who I'm talking about... \"I'll have a quarter of a salad and some water -- oh no, wait, I'm full just talking about it.\"  I'll be back to try more tasty items for sure. Y la pr√≥xima vez, ¬°margaritas definitivamente estar involucrados! (And next time, margaritas will definitely be involved!)"}
{"text":"It is one of of our favorite go-to Mexican places whenever we are in town.  This last visit was no different than previous visits, and consistency is so critical to a restaurant's success.  As usual, good service and our food came out piping hot.  On one occasion, we met the owner's daughter and she helped us to order some authentic Mexican food.  She was very proud of her grandma's home recipe and accomplishment.  We loved supporting family owned business."}
{"text":"Keep in mind there are 2, ok 3 different kinds of Mexican food restaurants. 1)Fast food, ie Taco Bell etc. 2)Americanized Mexican food with gobs of cheese and beef, serving dishes like fajitas and chimichangas that they've never heard of in Mexico. 3)Authentic Mexican food.  Lindo falls somewhere between 2 & 3.  The food tasted good and they did have a few select authentic Mex dishes on the menu (I had the goat) but mostly it's just Americanized Mex food that is available in any town across the USA."}
{"text":"This is my total favorite Mexican place.  The staff is like  me second family.  Javier is my favorite waiter.  I have made it a habit to tell him only the type of meat I want and he picks the dish.  Today I went with 5 friends and he choose dishes for every one.  Amazing is a total understatement ... I'm so lucky to be able to eat there 4-5 times a year as I live in Hawaii."}
{"text":"Really the best Mexican cuisine restaurant in Las Vegas. Food is amazing, had Beef Tacos and a side of Nachos and the food tasted incredible. I highly recommend you go to this place if you're a foodie and want to try something new. Gave this a five star."}
{"text":"I love me some good mexican food and this place delivered. A buddy of mine that is also a big fan and he now lives in Las Vegas highly recommended this place. I had the #17 lunch special which was a Carnitas plate with all the fixings for $10.25. The carnitas was cooked well and had great flavor. The chips and salsa where also good. If you're off the beaten path in Vegas stop on by."}
{"text":"Service is excellent!  Im a foodie and know restaurants and everytime I come here Im amazed at how well Im taken care of.    Food is great and it has an amazing view of the strip at night."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in town!  Service is always outstanding, food is always yummy, and great chips, salsa and bean dip."}
{"text":"The food is really good don't get me wrong love the guacamole :) BUT THE BAND ! TO LOUD IF YOU HAVE KIDS DONT COME !!  I have sensitive ears and I asked nicely if the can stop and they didn't so I don't recommend for kids and when the musics loud that means everyone is basically yelling to have a conversation so anyway the band needs to go BTW if you say it's your birthday you get a free shot of tequila;) just saying bye"}
{"text":"1st time... it was PACKED.....and I must admit, I was concerned that it would impact the service...BUT the service was exemplary and the food was fabulous!  I will definitely be back and recommend it to friends and family!  Thank you all for an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Completely disappointed from the door how do u try to sit 5 people on a 4 seater booth completely fuck up my order I've been here when it's been way busier and my order and everything has been done wonderfully not to mention our waiter Oscar was rushing me to place my order and still managed to not make it right such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but nothing to rave about. View is great, but they don't offer a window seat even if there are several available."}
{"text":"I've been to the other Lindo Michoacan and wasn't impressed with the food. The meats are overcooked. I found the same thing at this Michoacan. I tried the shredded beef taco and the meat was extra dry. Also, I didn't care for the deep-fried taco shell. The fajitas were just OK with the meat again being dry. The service was good and the staff were friendly, but that isn't enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"Just visited the newer location on Centennial (Northwest Vegas).  This place gets all kinds of blessings from Zagat and Best of Las Vegas, but I just don't see why.  The food was ok, not outstanding, not poor, but nothing to write home about or rave over.  We started with the Nopalitos (cactus) as an appy, and that was very good, in retrospect the highlight of the meal.  For entrees we shared the PESCADO a la VALLARTA which was Orange Roughy, and for a chicken dish we had the GALLO al CHIPOTLE ESTILO.  The fish was ok, the chicken overly tough.   That was enough, quantity was just fine but we came away thinking \"why is this place so popular?\""}
{"text":"I had different Mexican people refer me to this place as what they consider the best Mexican food in the area. I was actually surprised because I just thought it was OK and I wasn't impressed. I got my favorite dish, chile verde plate, and the meat was just too dried out. I just cant find good Mexican food in this area and that's probably because I've had the best Mexican food from California and Texas."}
{"text":"I've had a great experience every time I have dined here. The staff is very attentive and friendly and the food is great. I personally just don't enjoy the shredded chicken very much but everything else is amazing"}
{"text":"Excellent food and large portions. Had Chili relleno and beef taco. Great flavor. Chips served with salsa and refried beans. Juan Carlo provided great service."}
{"text":"Good food only I wish they had a bit more flavor in there tacos.."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in. Vegas bar none. They authentic and the table side guacamole is excellent. They have a few dishes in this restaurant that I have only seen in Mexico. I would recommend either of their mole selections because both are excellent, but my absolute favorite is the Tia Esther chicken plate. It's a little spicy but it's amazing. Be careful not to fill up on chips"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. But I am a creature of habit and just order the same thing every time I come here. They seriously have the best shrimp cocktail- and the size of their medium shrimp cocktail is a whole meal in itself. The shrimp is so fresh and there about 50 large shrimp in your bowl. Don't fill up on their chips, salsa and retried beans though! Those are good appetizers as well. For dessert don't forget the sopapillas with vanilla ice cream. It's to die for!"}
{"text":"Last two times I went, the food was not cooked properly (half raw shrimp) and the steak had giant tendons running through the middle making it inedible.  This was for entrees that were about $20 each.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"We went for dinner and had the taquitos and beef tacos. When they brought our plates the waiter warned us that the taco plate was extremely hot and not to touch. The tacos were so hot it was obvious that they either microwaved them or they sat under a heat  lamp for a good amount of  time. The taquitos came out and the plate was not hot at all and the taquitos were barely warm. The only thing that was warm on the taquito plate was the sour cream! gross.. our waiter was nice but that is not enough for us to return. I really wish this place was good because we haven't been able to find a great mexican food place in Vegas yet."}
{"text":"The OG is as authentic as I imagined. We decided to go on a Friday night and there was a band playing. The service was excellent and the food is delicious. The margaritas are heavy pour which made me a tipsy, happy girl.   Few items we ordered: Carne Asada full of flavor and tender, chicken fajitas, table side guacamole, fresh tortillas, all very good. I will definitely be back with friends or family that prefer lively dinners."}
{"text":"Wonderful Mexican Food  The place was full of people, energy and the wonderful smells from the food just the taste buds twitching and they weren't disappointed. Margaritas to get things underway, Oysters to start and then into the Rib-eye with cilantro sauce, which was an interesting experience and one I would recommend.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Love the view of the LV strip. The food was okay in flavor, not as authentic as I thought it would be. I did enjoy the fresh tortillas. The service was good."}
{"text":"I rarely write Yelp reviews but this place is the best almost-sectet in Las Vegas... Ace margarita's, superb menu and some of the best service in Las Vegas. In many trips over the years, I have never heard one complaint from anyone I have brought here. 10/10"}
{"text":"I have eaten here quite a few times since it opened, and I have to say they have a great view and a great Margarita.  The chips and bean dip are very good (hard not to fill up on them, in fact).  They have some atypical items on the menu, which is always nice. My daughter is a big fan of the unusual items (goat, tongue, etc.) whereas I stick with a more traditional line (Carnitas, Chile Rellenos).  While the food is good and plentiful, it could be a bit spicier and a bit more imaginative. The Rellenos need more cheese and less batter.  Does every dish have to come with beans and rice?  (Admittedly, their beans and rice are better than most.)  My biggest complaint with most Mexican food in Vegas (and this applies to Chinese food here most of the time, too) is that it's too bland.  Spice is life, people!!!  ;D"}
{"text":"I seriously love the food here. We had to come twice while being on our mini trip because it was just that delicious. The service is great I highly recommend you guys checking them out while being in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food. Service is also above and beyond what anyone would expect. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this place. This place is amazing and in my opinion the best Mexican restaurant west of Mississippi. They also have live mariachi on the weekends so it's a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Really good family owned restaurant.  Home made tortillas, waiters really knock themselves out to make sure your dining experience is everything it can be. I ordered a burrito- it was HUGE.  I have no small appetite and was only able to eat about 1/4 of it. We ordered guacamole- really yummy.  They make it up for you at the table.  We had some who like spicy, some mild, he made two bowls- one of each. My husband had chiles rellenos (his yardstick by which he rates any and all Mexican restaurants) and gives them a full five stars. Knocking off a couple of stars for the following: AC was off for most of our visit.  I don't care how good the food is, if you're uncomfortable the overall experience suffers. We had to relocate to another booth because we were sardined in.  The next table over had ample room for the 4 of us.  The soup they serve to everyone at the beginning of the meal reminds me of Lipton noodle soup. Bleh."}
{"text":"The food is very good.  Service is beyond expectations.  We always visit when we visit the grandkids.  We live in Phoenix and so enjoy this restaurant.  Always busy but very accommodating."}
{"text":"we came in for lunch with friends from out of town- it was all of our first time at the restaurant, and it was INCREDIBLE. the food was delicious, great salsa and sauces on everything!!   but beyond the food- the service was top notch. almost all of us at the table are servers, and we were blown away. our glasses were always full, and we never had empty plates left on the table. the servers and bussers were polite, and able to tend to the table without hardly being noticed!!   our servers name was Enrique, and we would highly recommend him, and the entire establishment to anyone!"}
{"text":"Javier took marvelous care of us! With city view seating we completely enjoyed chimichangas, (carnitas filled) table side guacamole, and creamy looking yummy tequila filled frozen margaritas.        The churros are yummy but their Flan is the Best In the Las Vegas valley!!!  Don't bother with their \"fried \" ice cream. Bleh!"}
{"text":"This expansive restaurant offers an authentic Mexican experience. It's traditionally decorated, with many tables and low-lit booths for romantic dining. Though if you're planning lots of convo with your lover, request a seat toward the back, because a mariachi band plays live music. Better yet, stop yapping and listen while kicking back with a cocktail because the band kicks ass! These are pros, folks, playing violins, trumpet, guitars--super tight, with festive songs and beautiful singing for the ballads.   The service was attentive, efficient, and friendly; waitstaff never far. The food is just right for the price point. I had a steak enchilada with the house mole, dark and rich, with subtle layers of cocoa, nuts and spice ($15.95) My date had Gallo al Conac ($16.95). Don't know how it was made but he was swooning over it. The house margarita is $9 each. We paid $4 more apiece for the jumbo (make it a double!). Fried ice-cream, aka Lindo Flameado ($8.25), was the logical and delicious choice for dessert. We were celebrating my friend's birthday on a Friday night, so it was the perfect fiery and fantastic ending to our meal. He blew out the flames shortly after dessert arrived and made a wish. He didn't let the liquor burn off on its own, so a very rummy spoonful was his reward, lol!"}
{"text":"I always go there for breakfast before leaving LAS VEGAS. This time (yesterday) I was a little sad- they no longer offer he brunch buffet in the mornings :( This meant limiting my taste buds to just one main item...LOL. I went with the Red Chilaquiles which were very good. The waiters (we had two men) were very attentive and my glass never went below halfway. The friendly atmosphere is very welcoming."}
{"text":"I love this place! I lived in Henderson for 2-3 years and everytime I go back for a visit I have to go here.  It reminded me of the food I grew up on. Homemade corn tortillas, awesome mole, and Milanesa.  I have taken family and friends there and everyone loves it. It does get busy on weekends but there is plenty of parking and they have a bar if you want to have a maragrita while you wait.    The waiters are friendly and the atmosphere is warm and inviting."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior with a great bar area. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Had the Coca Cola carnitas and devil shrimp which were so good. Also had the fresh made guacamole which was great!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great Taquitos Dorado, great salsa, wonderful service and the margaritas are big and well priced."}
{"text":"The view / atmosphere is awesome.  Depending on when you come depends on how quick you get in (duh). I've been here on days with an hour wait, but I came yesterday and was seated instantly.   Their service is stellar. Our waiter wasn't very friendly, however he was on top of his game. You're never out of chips / dip / drinks.   Decent selection of beer. Good selection of margaritas and house drinks. They're in the process of redoing their drink menu as well.  FYI their drinks are STRONG. It's not necessarily a bad thing since i'd rather have too strong of a drink than a watered down one.   Food is pretty good, kinda depends on what you order. Their speciality dishes are more expensive but taste better in my opinion; I don't really recommend their lunch specials.  Guacamole is made right in front of you and it's bomb.   I would come again for sure, however there are some competitors out there that give Lindo a run for their money"}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars but every ten minutes they sing happy bday.  The view , food, an service is amazing!!!  Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great food and great service, a lot of value. We sat by the window and had a nice view of the city. The red snapper was delicious and the table side guacamole was perfect, I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"We just left...... Mediocre and greasy......  OVERPRICED!!!  Our busboy Chris way outshined our order taker guy, Angel. Sorry Angel-"}
{"text":"The staff were all professional, friendly, and very helpful. They were very busy, but our table of 6 never even had our drinks get low without being topped off.  The food was great as well, it was a great experience. We sat outside with a great view of the strip lights too!"}
{"text":"The Food here is delicious, the fideo soup was a nice surprise and it was very tasty. The bean dip with the chips and salsa also something different and delicious. We went for a birthday party and the environment was very lively, the gave the birthday people free shots which were according to them very good. The waiters were very attentive. If you want to have some great mexican food off the strip this place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat!! Love the enchiladas de mole!! My favorite!! Service was great! Wait wasn't long and the waiter was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Came in late into LV and was craving Mexican food.   Lindo Michoacan has fairly authentic casual Mexican food, some of the better I have had in a long long time.   Having been all over Mexico several times and specifically the opportunity to eat my way through Mexico City, I am generally very picky when it comes to Mexican food.   We had the fresh guacamole, shrimp ceviche, tacos al pastor, and two tostadas chicken and chorizo.   The guacamole was outstanding. Great balance of lime juice, spice, and onions with a perfect consistency.   Tacos al pastor were also very good although not the most authentic I've had (close though). The pastor meat though was particularly delicious I was just not a fan of the way they used the pineapple (one big slice instead of shreds).   Tostadas were probably the least impressive but by no means bad.   All in all I highly recommend the place. Food is fresh and delicious with clearly high quality ingredients. To boot it's reasonably priced (for the quantity)."}
{"text":"As I say when I check in here... It's simply always constantly excellent. Want fresh fish on the lighter side with lots of garlic and olive oil? They got it. In the mood for a huge bone in ribeye cooked to perfect temp topped with, whatever you want? Come here before spending an arm and leg at a steakhouse.  Chicken enchiladas con mole? Oooh, the Mole! Que Rico.   My wife Lorena Peril is a headliner at Luxor (opportunistic plug, please buy her songs on iTunes) also mi chacita Flacita. Growing up in a heavy Hispanic household with many close by relatives complete with mariachi and quesinera. This is her go to place at least 3 times monthly. 3 weeks ago she sat in with the house musician and nailed 2 songs. The name of which I can neither pronounce or spell. Ay Gringo.   Margaritas flow with perfection no matter how you like it.   We do have a favorite section and table however you can't go wrong no matter where you sit.   With drinks, food, and tip. It's rarely over 100$ for the 2 of us. A fantastic place for early Sunday dinner at any of their locations.   Authentic Mexican cuisine at its finest."}
{"text":"I'm not sure at all why this place is rated so low!  It is consistently good at this location, and we eat here all the time!  I throughly enjoy the fish tacos, while my husband loves the Banderillas de Toro. (I think that's how it's spelled. Steak and veggie skewers.)  We always get an order or two of guacamole.  Love love love Lindo!"}
{"text":"Try the grilled salmon or mackerel, or any veggie. The are so many yummy items, but are served tapas style, so order several and bring a few friends."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good. If you go you have to get the table side guacamole they make it right in front of you, tastes great. Got the diablo shrimp, not spicy but still tasty. Chicken quesadilla is great. All the wait staff is exceptional. Nice view of the strip if you sit on the lower section. Recommend a reservation because this place is extra busy."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I never got to try! This review isn't on the food at all. My husband and I are seated around 2:20pm. We get our our ordered quickly but we sit until 2:50pm before the porter notices that we haven't been asked to order. He does he waiters job to take our order. We left. We didn't order anything. It's unacceptable to wait 30 minutes to have an order taken.   They were not busy at all. When we told the porter we wanted to leave the waiter came by asking us what we wanted. Joel the waiter started to argue with my husband telling him, \"come on man. I was busy.\" We wouldn't have been so upset if he didn't come around to check on all the other tables 15 minutes earlier and never acknowledging us. He wasn't busy. I will wait if a waiter doesn't come around to check on anyone.   The best Mexican food I never got to try at all. I won't be back.   I can't expect good food from service like this on a slow day. Plus the menu is to big to have good food."}
{"text":"Amazingly flavorful mexican food..!! Loved the strawberry margarita , bean and spicy salsa dip and fresh hot chips!! For a enchilada non-lover, I am totally converted!! I loved their cheese enchiladas!!  So many vegetarian options!! Even their rice n beans don't have chicken stalk. Great portions. Excellent service..  Can't wait to come back again!!"}
{"text":"Best Authentic Mexican food in Vegas!!! Great food,great View of the city. Tons of fun for big groups and Birthdays!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely  love this place the customer service the food is amazing. Homemade tortillas and great food"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant that I have ever been to. Mexican restaurants in New England are not even half good as this. All the items were fantastic. We were a party of three and each of us enjoyed our lunch. I believe this place is very popular among locals. We had to wait for 15 minutes to get a table. Special Thanks to our waiter Fredy who checked with us frequently if we needed anything. The salsa that came with Tortilla chips was amazing. We kept finishing the large bowl but was always politely given another bowl by Fredy. He understood we loved those chips and salsa. As our order for main course was getting late, we ordered guacamole for the chips. It tasted even better with guac.  After 3 bowls of chips and a couple of beers, we got our main course. I have ordered for \"Tia Esther\". My friends have gone with \"Gallo al Chipotle Estilo\" and Enchiladas. They serve tortillas with all the orders. All of us liked our dishes. I wasn't able to finish mine but had the leftover as a snack later."}
{"text":"A favorite date night spot. The table-side guacamole is amazing, as well as many of the entrees with their varying sauces (i love sauces). Very traditional and authentic, negra modelo and some pollo zirahuen and I'm happy! Carlos the server is fantastic, we ask for him every time, a great guy!"}
{"text":"Soooo awesome always packed have mariachis fridays and saturdays totally recommend them!"}
{"text":"The best place to watch the sunset over Las Vegas is the bar at Lindo Michoacan.  Sit toward the middle or right side for the best view.  Order margaritas and fresh guacamole, and love life.  For bonus amor, get the Chicken Mole. It is a dish usually served at festivals - with a rich and mildly spicy sauce made of cocoa and poblano chiles. My Mexican dinner guest raved over it!  I have been here more times than I can remember. The Best!"}
{"text":"\"Tastes like home!\" - say my Mexican friends.   This Gringo is partial to Mole - that tasty sauce with a poblano pepper and cocoa base. They do a fantastic job here! Highly recommended!  I also love the fresh, made-at-the-table guacamole, done any way you like (extra extra cilantro and lime por favor!)  If you've never had beer done as a michelada, this is a good place to do it. The beer/hot sauce/lime combo might seem odd at first, but it is a delightful (and very Mexican) accompaniment to a traditional meal.  I find the much-celebrated margaritas to be far too sweet. Sometimes I can get the bartender to make me a drink with fresh limes and no simple syrup, and it is great! Usually though, it's just a sugar-bomb with booze. Maybe I just haven't figured out how to properly order what I like.  TIP: Be aware of the music situation when you arrive. The amplified keyboardist/singer is a good musician, but can get *very* loud. I prefer to sit far away - or even in another room when he's cranking them out. The roaming mariachi band is festive and fun.   All-in-all, I prefer a hole-in-the-wall taqueria for my Mexican food. But for a fun and friendly dining experience with a FIESTA! ambiance, you can't beat Lindo Michoacan."}
{"text":"I'm very hard to please so I was very surprise how I like this place...note I just said \"like\".  I am not a huge Mexican food fan, which is surprising since I am from Texas but the place was nice and the view was pretty good.  Too bad we had a sand storm so you really couldn't see the strip.    When you first walked in, the smell of the restaurant is sooo yummy!  I ordered the whole fish, Mojarra Frit o Al Mojo de Ajo...which was deep fried Tilapia.  It was so good!  And it freaked my colleagues out because it was a whole fish and came with it's head...hahaha!  The only thing I didn't get or like was it came with lettuce, tomatoes, guacamole and stead cut french fries which seems to be out of place for such a pretty dish.  I would have rather had more rice.  If I am to go back again, that is what I will ask for.  The soup they serve, Fideo Soup was just perfect!  We also ordered fresh  guacamole, which they come by the table and you watch them make it in front of you, which is awesome!  And very tasty and fresh.  I wasn't too impress with the bean dip and hot sauce dip that came with the chips.  But hey I think that's a marketing way for you to order the guacamole.  Overall, it was a pleasant experience but I think I will go again with peeps I don't work with and probably come back with even better review!"}
{"text":"I'm in Las Vegas at least once a year and I always make it a point to get off the strip and have a meal here. The food is amazing. It's authentic fare, not the typical Tex-Mex. I try something new every time and it's all amazingly good. The service is fast and the atmosphere is festive."}
{"text":"Amazing little find off the beaten path in Vegas! Fabulous customer service, spot on food, drinks & dessert! Gorgeous decor, clean and they accept reservations!!! Family of four (2 teens) had, fajitas x2, burrito, an amazing shrimp dish and the BEST table side guacamole ever! A must try!!!"}
{"text":"Lindo's is great. On a busy Friday night, we were seated within 10 minutes and the waiter was so accommodating. Food was great too and came out hot and just as expected. Beware, the servings are big!   Complimentary chips and salsa and bean dip, mmmmmm.   Also, they had a mariachi band there, singing for birthdays and just in general. It was loud on a Friday night but also a fun atmosphere, we loved it. (The band takes breaks, don't worry.)  I wish we could have sat closer to the window that overlooks the city but you could still see it from where we were- really incredible real estate!"}
{"text":"When in last night for a date night with my husband , we waited maybe 5 minutes which was awesome, the busser came right away with our chips n salsa but the Fideo we got almost right before we got our food , the server wasn't too friendly he looked mad I wanted him to take us a picture but I was scared to ask because he looked mad , anyways I ordered carne Tampique√±a & a blended margarita and my husband ordered shrimp fajitas & Modelo draft .... When the food arrived we couldn't believe how the shrimp fajitas looked it was about 5-7 really small shrimp I mean if your paying $20 you expect a nice decent plate horrible my husband was a little upset , my food was ok the meat was a little chewy and didn't like the yellow cheese on top of the enchilada it doesn't give it an authentic taste .. Well server didn't offer us a second drink or nothing ..I don't  think we would be back :("}
{"text":"My friend kept saying how this was one of her favorite places so I thought we should check it out to see if the hype was true. Service was fast. It was nice to see that bean dip accompanied the chips & salsa.  I ordered a typical carne asada burrito while she ordered her favorite, shrimp tacos. There was nothing about the burrito that stood out. It wasn't the best, it wasn't the worst. I tried the shrimp tacos, they too were ok in my eyes. She however LOVES them. Sitting outside did help as spring nights in Vegas are always nice.  To me it didn't live up to the hype that was provided to me about this place. See for yourself"}
{"text":"OMG! ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!  ask for Gerardo....he took such good care of us and has such a welcoming smile and attitude!  Great food and even better margaritas. This place has amazing views of DTLV!"}
{"text":"I love it here! I came for the first time last night and I thought it was awesome! After reading all the yelp reviews, I wanted to try it. The place was packed when we got here but we only waited for about ten minutes. When we got seated, they gave us the best seat in the house. We had a beautiful view of the strip, it was so nice.   I loved the authentic feel and mariachi music. All of the employees had nice Mexican uniforms on. The margaritas were fantastic! First we tried the mango margaritas, soooo delicious! Second time around, my husband had the peach and I tried the skinny margarita. Both were also fantastic! We had the table side guacamole. It was so cool to watch the waiter prepare the guacamole right at our table. I've never had that before. Let me tell you.....that was the BEST guacamole I've ever had! It was so delicious and fresh. My husband and I couldn't stop eating it, lol. For dinner, my husband had the beef tongue mole, it was also very delicious. I can't remember the name in Spanish of what I had but it consisted of large shrimp and a spicy sauce. It was delicious as well but very spicy for my taste. I was also surprised at the side of the shrimp. The menu called them \"giant\" and they weren't very giant. However, everything was delicious and the service was excellent! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I just can't get enough of Lindo's, also it's mom's favorite food & view.  The service is fantastic!  These wonderful people are like family to me, Manny, Gerardo, who make this restaurant, make the world go round in here even though they are always on the go.  That personal touch goes a long way and here years later we still love it every time.    Lovely nice to come w/ a colorful cloudy horizon which I had to post cause the view here is remarkable.  Bridget got the Mango Margarita, I got the Jalape√±o Margarita, mom, the usual regular Margarita & dad a Pinot Noir.  I think I'll try the Mango w/ jalape√±o next time lol.  Spicy and sweet.  Everyone loved their dish!  Mom got the grilled fish tacos, yum!  She could only finish two, after all the warm chips, bean dip & salsa.  So addicting!  I finished the third fish taco and may get that next time, but there's too many good menu items!    Dad got the dish I always get when I'm eating 'healthy' the Pollo Rebeka, which is served w/ pasilla strips & flour tortillas.  Totally yum!    Bridget also got what I love except w/ steak, I usually get it w/ chicken, but she loved it.  The Enchiladas de Mole are two cheese enchiladas w/ a side of either beef or chicken.  The sauce is a must-try!    I felt like the Toro de Coca Cola again!  A huge steak medium, smothered in a mole Coca Cola type of sauce.  Trust me under all that sauce is a huge piece of meat.  I wrap up slices in a flour tortilla w/ sour cream & whoa, talk about tasty amazing!  Similar feeling towards all of my favorite dishes though.  My second time this dish & it's definitely made for two!  Actually dad & I ended up taking half of our meals home cause the portions are so large and they also serve either a salad or fideo soup.   Tres Leches w/ coconut was how we finished the already filling & beautiful evening.  It was truly the cherry on top.  Mmm!  I highly recommend it!  Also I think that for the food lovers who don't like Lindo's they should order something outside of the box like one of the many dishes that I am addicted to!  I list them w/ pix.  It's not what you'd get at a regular Mexican restaurant & most dishes come w/ corn or flour tortillas, kind of like a fajita.  I haven't ever had fajitas here, my fav, cause I've fallen in love w/ so many other unique dishes.    Happy eating friends!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, excellent drinks, attentive service. This was the best mexican food experience I have had in Las Vegas so far. I wrote a tip on yelp about the chicken dish we ordered, unfortuanltly I cant find that section right now, ask your server for a popular chicken dish they serve. It was so tasty and spicy I can't wait to go back and eat it again! Definitely try to get there earlier or make reservations if you can, when we were leaving there were people waiting."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since I moved to Henderson/ Vegas in 2010. I kind of have a Love-Hate relationship with this place really. I was told that this place was GREAT for Mexican food and I took whomever's word for it.  The food is good but it is not that great although I do believe it comes down to what you order.  I usually steer away from the combination specials especially during lunchtime. They are a good value but you really get what you pay for. I have ordered a few lunch specials in the past that included the Chilie Relleno and it was so dry. The top of the Relleno had no sauce other than what was crusted on top. If you order the Relleno make sure you ask for extra sauce on top.  The more expensive specials are the way to go, remember you get what you pay for. I have ordered the Pollo con Rajas y Crema Estilo, the Mojarra and the Huchainango, all good but not enough for me to bring it to a four star. The Chile Relleno and my experiences with the lunch specials really make this place an average restaurant experience.  Now the views are great and the restaurant is clean and festive. As for the staff, sometimes they are wonderful and sometimes they seem to be going through the motions. Put those together and you have average again.  I really wished I liked this place better but like I said, MEH average!"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5/5 stars  Second dinner of the night! hahah I just finished my first dinner, and drove over here for my second dinner.  Overall, the ambiance is VERY loud on a Wednesday night. It was rather difficult to converse with my friend; there was a huge bday party next to us. We heard the staff sang happy birthday to at least 4 groups while we were there--must be the place to go for bday celebrations!  Ordered: 1) Guacamole: Hand made right in front of you: 3.5/5 2) Steak Ranchero: Medium; Cooked to perfection; Actually my expectation was low since it was not from a steakhouse, but overall impressed: 3.5/5  Overall, a nice venue to get away from the typical Vegas crowd--lots of locals here."}
{"text":"Mediocre,  and unauthentic Mexican food,  yellow cheese on everything. They fill you up with rice and beans. It's more like  taco bell served with silverware. The seafood served is not fresh and the classic Mexican dishes like the moles are run of the mill.  They all lack flavor.   Long list of different types of margaritas but no matter which one you order they're all exactly the same. Yet you pay a premium for the tequila in it.    Yet this place is super crowded,  it must be the view. They have the best view of any restaurant in Las Vegas. That is why I give them two stars,  well deserved."}
{"text":"Very  goog place   The  prices  a little  expensives  but  the  food  is  amazine  i recomend  this  place"}
{"text":"Food is always good. Margaritas are awesome. Service was excellent. One of our favorite places."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to anyone who visits Las Vegas. We were in town for 3 days and we visited this restaurant twice. Their service was amazing and their food was amazing. Everything about this restaurant was great. Would definitely come back and recommend to people."}
{"text":"I am so shocked that this place has so many good reviews. I went there last week and had a total of 5 in my party and was seated in the middle of the room. I was ok with that for a few moments until people started bumping into our chairs going back and fourth to the kitchen. As we sat there we watched the hostess seat a party of 2 in a large booth that would have accommodated my party so I asked the hostess why she sat us there she just looked at me and said \"I have another booth available do you want to move?\" YES I would like that! It just got worse from there, I though they had mariachi and maybe they do but I guess they don't play on Saturdays or they didn't the day I was there. Now to the food. We are Mexican and all I can say is that it is very American Mexican. The food didn't take very long however when it did come out it was cold! It was just a very bad experience from start to finish."}
{"text":"came here with some friends a few months ago and woooow! this place deserves its title because every thing was impeccable. The food, the service, and even the decor was perfect! It is a nice date night place. (sigh) Just thinking about my dinner here makes me smile =D"}
{"text":"Great food.  The Shrimp Chile relleno and beef fajitas were amazing.  Try the churros, you need them.  The guacamole was fresh and we enjoyed Mario creating it tableside.  We will be back."}
{"text":"The food was amazing.  I heard about it on the radio and we needed some delicious Mexican food.  We all shared a bite of each of our plates and we were all wishing we could eat them all.  We finished off dinner with soapapillas and we waddled away in delight.  There were three birthday parties and one gentleman server, I wish I caught your name, who worked his behind off keeping track of tables.   We will be back and we will bring friends!  Your shrimp chile rellenos are amazing by the way."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. Both times were exceptional. The service was amazing. We never had to worry about our water or drinks running out.   The home made tortillas were great. I had the \"Fajitas de Camarones\" (shrimp fajitas). They were good, not great but definitely worth what we paid. My girlfriend ordered what I believe they call the \"Steak Ranchero\" and it was huge cooked perfect.   They also have a mariachi band which was fun. Definitely a family friendly restaurant. Their customer service is through the roof with decently priced meals."}
{"text":"Great place to celebrate a birthday (whole staff  participates) .  Delicious food and outstanding service from Juan Carlos along with the rest of the staff . I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Simply the best  This is Mexican Fine food not Mexican fast food . As a traveler I get to eat many restaurants .  When I am at home in  Las Vegas  I always eat at Lindo Michoacan the food is great the service is great . My favorite is the chicken coratedado.   The flavor is from the Pacific coast of Mexico .  Also the guacamole is the best in Las Vegas  the flavor is as good as if you were in Michoacan Mexico the Soul Food capital. Enjoy !"}
{"text":"We went here on the advise of a friend and the good reviews.  I am not understanding what the deal is with Mexican food in Las Vegas, but it is weird.  I am from San Diego.  Totally different.  What is fideo soup?  Tasteless wattery liquid with little noodles (?).  Not an issue, just don't eat it.  Then there is the Salsa.  This is the second restaurant that has had this strange tasting salsa.  The salsa is what kills it for me.  I need salsa on my mexican food and this salsa ruined the food.  Asked if they had anything different, the answer was no.  I am sticking to Roberto's and Rubios for mexican from now on."}
{"text":"For what you pay it's a good deal. Food is fresh and flavorful. My girlfriend and I had dinner, dessert, and coffee for $30 each including tax and tip. Table side guacamole is great and delicious !"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place once per week for 5 years, and for a reason ... it's consistently good!   Service is always top notch. I'd recommend trying the lunch specials. I've had them all and never been disappointed.   It gets really busy on weekend evenings so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"I frequently visit this location because I have noticed that the food at this particular location here is the best. The food was still amazing as always and the service was fast especially considering how busy they were but, the atmosphere was completely off. I could barely talk to our server without having to yell. We were also sat at a table that was very tight fitting i was uncomfortable the whole time I was eating my food. So as far as food I give it a 8 out of 10 stars but, for atmosphere I would give it a 2 out of 10 stars."}
{"text":"I went there on last Saturday night for dinner with my husband, and while the food was very good the service was horrid.  We were seated immediately and within 30 seconds our waiter came to the table to take our order.   We told him that we were just seated and needed time to look at the menu.  We did order club sodas and the bus boy brought those over with chips and salsa within 2 minutes.  The waiter came back a few minutes later to take our order.  Our first course was a tomato based soup which was very good.  About 10 minutes after we ordered our meal it showed up to the table.  I was beginning to feel a little rushed.  A moment later the bus boy showed up at our table and tried to clear away our chips and salsa that we were still eating.  I let him know this and he left them and went away.   My husband ordered chicken fajitas and it only came with 3 very small tortillas.  We got the attention of our waiter as requested a few additional.  By the time he brought them back to the table 15 minutes later my husband had just continued to eat his dinner with a fork and no longer required them as we had finished eating.  We then requested to go containers.  The waiter brought them to the table.  As my husband and I were packing up our leftovers the bus boy again came by and tried to clear my dishes before I could pack up my food.  My plate was over half-full when he tried to take it.  I again say while the food was very good the wait staff needs additional training.  I do not think we will be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"I love this place so much I couldn't help but yelp this place while I'm still here eating!   Friendliest staff in Vegas. INCREDIBLE SERVICE!  Decent prices- great beer prices! Plus you get a ton of complimentary stuff like chips, salsa, bean dip, and soup!   Incredible dishes with great sizes.  I'll always make the trip to come here!  BRAVO LIndo!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant ever!! Homemade flour & corn tortillas!! The atmosphere & food are amazing! Don't pass this place up! I wish we had this restaurant in California!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 5 stars because the food was good and the restaurant itself is so pretty and traditional, but the service is really slow!! I was so annoyed! But the servers were nice and like I said the food was delicious. It's also in a really pretty location and he view is beautiful. They give you fresh salsa and beans with chips to start you off, then they give you a little bowl with sopa de fideo. Both were so good. The amount of food they give you is definitely worth the money. I had the camarones Stephanie and they were so tasty. The aguachiles are also a must try!"}
{"text":"Ugh my first not so lovely review ! The customer service in this place is good but !! After waiting 45 mins and having the man come back and ask what our orders where again I was a little annoyed. Another 15 mins and our food arrives it is the complete opposite of what I originally told the man I wanted I'm beyond disappointed and will not return my business my kids ordered the chicken strip fry meal they have and the fries where horrible. Not to mention they bring out a soup with the chips and beans that they automatically charge you for. Would have been nice to no I was getting charged for what I had no intentions on eating !!"}
{"text":"Yes, the view is great but you don't need to eat the lousy food to get the view. Park and stand outside in the parking lot. You won't waste your money.  The coca cola pork had so much fat it was almost inedible. A knife couldn't even cut the meat. The whole fish was so dry it was tough to even get through the shell to any meat.   We were there with an out-of-town guest and she was paying. When the poor quality meat was pointed out, they took a few dollars off the bill. We were too embarrassed to complain and ruin the evening.   They should be ashamed of the food. The only thing good was the view. Shame, shame, shame."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! This was my second visit and I was so excited because first time was amazing. I brought my family who was visiting and was so embarrassed! Food was luke warm to cold and cheese was not melted, not enough sauce at all on burritos so food must of sat in back a while before it was served to us. Mole sauce looked old! Not good at all! Will not be going back to this location! What a waste of time and money!"}
{"text":"I can finally end my search for the perfect mexican restaurant in Henderson/Las Vegas!  Great location with a beautiful view of Las Vegas and mountains from the bar.  Food is seriously excellent (especially the guacamole made at the table side!), service is impeccable, margaritas are tasty and the atmosphere is casual yet appealing!  You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times since moving here from Chicago 7 months ago. Each time I have found there food to be pretty authentic and good decent food. The chips are complimentary and served with a mild salsa and a warm yummy bean dip. I was recently here for Cinco de Mayo. There were 5 of us and 3 had never been there before. Everyone enjoyed their meal. I like flan and theirs is excellent not too sweet or \"eggy\" tasting. The one thing that stands out for me is their excellent service even during the crowd during Cinco de Mayo the wait staff always made sure we had drinks, chips and water. The music they have on most nights in the bar is a nice touch also."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went here for the first time a couple months ago and I loved it! I have been to other Lindo Michoacan's but this one has got the BEST VIEW. Went later on in the evening and got lucky to get a window seat, and the view was INCREDIBLE. Be careful when ordering because portions are HUGE. Only reason I give 4 stars is because it took us awhile to get our waiters attention to get drink refills and our bill. Other than that it was amazing! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I wish I could rate it higher! For the Pros of this place;  1. Nice restaurant atmosphere, clean, great view of the city!  2. Good drink selection  3. Servers are VERY nice, quick, and enjoyable!  Cons; 1. No flavor to the food have tried this place twice now hoping for better result but sadly disappointed. Far from authentic. Very very bland. I've honestly tasted better flavor at Roberto's. 2. Parking lot is very small, but obviously didn't have much land to work with so not entirely their fault.  If you are looking for good flavor Mexican food I'm sorry but you won't find it here. Good service yes, but zero flavor."}
{"text":"I heard this place was the best Mexican restaurant in Vegas and...I AGREE!!  Phenomenal food, service and atmosphere!  I loved getting off the strip and finding this gem.  I heard about it from someone in my home town and had to find it during my visit.  Oh my gosh!  The bartender, Ely, was fantastic- very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly!   I wanted a seafood dish and she suggested I get the \"Chiles Rellenos de Cameron\" and I absolutely LOVED it!  There are so many great options on the menu, I needed help making a decision. If you want Mexican food, you HAVE to find this place.  Sooo worth it!"}
{"text":"A real authentic Mexican restaurant. When I lived in Vegas this place was the spot to grub down on some good Mexican food. Nopales, tortillas a mano, queso fundido, etc etc the food is great and it taste home made. One of my favorite places I found while living in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Terrific, authentic Mexican restaurant. Beautiful decor. Charming, professional staff. Magnificent cuisine. I thoroughly enjoyed my Pescado Playa Azul, and my companion LOVED his carne asado.   The only thing wrong with this place is we eventually had to leave."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican spot for lunch. I had the #7 lunch and my wife had the Tacos Aguacate. I enjoyed the flavors and spice typically found in most Mexican dishes. We had great service and the chips and salsa were tasty too. Parking is easy and available. Prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was nice as well."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place. I haven't been here in 2years. The service is poor. The food is good. But don't expect them to serve you a good portion of rice. I tried there chocolate and ice cream dessert. Tasted like shit. So I tried flan. How can you screw up flan right?  Yep. They did. It tasted nothing like flan. Tasted like straight up cheesecake.  The place is going down hill. 2 years ago this place was good. But now,  now it is terrible.  Our server ignored us a few times, passing by many many times and never bothered to check to see how we we're doing."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite places to come eat.  I always get a frozen strawberry margarita & my boyfriend a coronarita.  So bomb.  When we're really hungry we start off with their \"QUESADILLA DE HARINA\" - flour tortilla with Monterrey jack cheese, sour cream, and guacamole ($7.25).  I get the \"FLAUTAS\" dinner - 6 fried rolled corn tortillas with beef, sour cream, and guacamole.  It also comes with rice and beans ($12.95).    My boyfriend gets different things each time, but we have yet to order something that we did not like.  You get complimentary chips and salsa.  Their salsas are so good.  We came here a few months ago on my boyfriend's birthday.  Our server sent over the mariachi band.  They made my bf wear a sombrero as they played a song for him and then made him take a shot of tequila.  It was a really fun experience.   The drinks are a little pricey.  I want to say the coronarita alone is like $18, if I remember correctly."}
{"text":"Went here last week and had the cilantro steak as recommended by a friend. It was one of the very best Mexican restaurants i've been too and the steak tasted really good!   We had a jar of mango mojito and it was very good as well.  Dinner for 3 & mojito came to about 100.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"From beginning to end I love this place and I make sure to eat here every single time I'm in Vegas. Delicious and you can never go wrong! I take new ppl with me every time and they alll love it!"}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican food I've ever had. I go there at least twice a month and every time it is awesome. The staff is super friendly and I love all the bartenders. Cynthia (bartender) is the best and Oscar (manager) is always inviting! Start with the table side guacamole and a margarita! The view isn't too bad either!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and this place is one of the best Mexican restaurants in town.  They have a huge selection of amazing dishes. Just reading the menu items description will have you salivating. I love the Steak Ranchero. Its a new york steak sitting in red and green sauce smothered in cheese.   Great view of the city and very authentic Mexican feel. The staff are so on top of things"}
{"text":"Nice view but horrible service and so disappointed with my food. While everyone was like \"pass the salsa, the chips\" I was like Pass the flavor yo!! Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The moment you enter Lindo Michoac√°n you will feel a unique authentic vibe about the restaurant. From the traditional Mexican clothing, warm and lively ambience, to its vast cultural d√©cor, dining in will make you feel like you're in Mexico. The restaurant gets very busy around lunch. There is limited parking space. Fortunately when I got there, a car was leaving so I didn't have to wait. They greet you at the entrance and you are seated right away. The menu is quite extensive, they have so many entr√©e options for chicken, beef, pork, seafood, vegetarian and soup, and they make specialty drinks and offer tasty desserts.  For starter, they serve you with complimentary tortilla chips, salsa, and bean dip. The homemade tortilla chips taste fresh. I love the mild smokey spiciness of the salsa, and the bean dip is serve warm and creamy. I went for Apatzingan and chose two Chicken Enchiladas ($13.25), it comes with Spanish Rice, Refried Beans, Guacamole, and I requested for Pico De Gallo and Avocado Slice. I really like my meal, the food is so flavorful especially when adding more of the smokey red salsa. The entree comes with Fideo Soup, which is a tomato based soup with chicken broth and Fideo Noodles. It's delicious!   For dessert I tried the Lindo Flameado ($8.25) which is a flaming fried vanilla ice cream ball coated with crush cereal and serve with sweet caramelize banana. When it arrive to my table, the dessert is literally on fire. I attempt to try eating it while it's on flame and then one of the server glance toward me giving me the signal to blow out the fire first. Well that makes a lot more sense. My first attempt blowing out the fire didn't work, it came right back. It took me three times to make sure the fire was out, and by that time the bottom of the Fried Ice Cream Ball is already charred. I think this particular dessert is entertaining to look at, but it is a lot to eat for one person. If you do decide to order this, make sure you have someone to share it with. Overall I feel the dining experience is good and the service is quick and efficient. What's more enjoyable is when they gather around you and you start hearing them sing a Happy Birthday Song, they will make you feel truly special."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! You have an amazing view of the strip. Service and food both excellent  I am really happy to find a Mexican restaurant close to home that I love."}
{"text":"Meh.  It was okay.  As everyone agrees, the view is fantastic.  Do yourself a favor, go to the parking lot, check out the view, then drive to another Mexican restaurant.  We were seated right away.  Awesome.  It was a Monday night, but still wildly crowded with no parking, so I was impressed to be seated right away by a very friendly hostess.  It was crazy loud.  Couldn't hear what anyone was saying right next to you.  I always order water first and this water tasted pretty bad for tap water.  No filter for sure.  The chips were good but the bean dip and salsa were really bland.  Our food was okay, nothing particularly flavorful or special.  All the entrees were around $18+, which to me pretty pricey for Mexican food.  (especially bland, uneventful food).  My margarita was pretty tasty.  Best part of the meal, for sure.  Then the waiter refused to acknowledge our table.  He was busy, so he willfully did not make eye contact with us, despite the fact we were ready for the check for a very long time.  He did check on his other tables, bus tables, seat guests, take orders and bring others their bill.  Except for once right after our meals were served, he never came back to check on us.  So, to sum it up..... View is great, Margaritas are good, Food is meh, Service is lacking.  If this was a Monday night, i don't want to imagine what a Saturday is. I do not understand why the parking lot is always packed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas, they have amazing food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Efrain is the absolute best! Thank you for your continued excellent hospitality. Oh and the food is good too ;)"}
{"text":"I went here last halloween with my boyfriend for a low key night. It was fun to walk in to everyone dressed up. The wait staff was by far the friendliest and very observant to keep the water glasses filled, which I find it hard to come by these days.   The food was very good, and the portion sizes were large for myself. Boyfriend had no trouble finishing his however, haha.  Prices were pretty standard I think. About 10-15 a plate,  depending on the meat and amount. Overall, it was a nice place with friendly people. I have been back once, and was treated the same, so although i haven't been a ton I would consider it to be a pretty consistent restaurant as far as staff and food goes; and that is what keeps me a continuous customer."}
{"text":"They were pushing the margaritas... we ordered one house margarita and one of the higher quality tequila margaritas and told the waiter not to tell us which one was which. We disagreed on which was the better one (so really the house margaritas here are delicious... and there's only a 2 dollar difference). Fresh tortilla chips, bean dip and salsa are complimentary and the baskets/bowls never get close to empty before being promptly replaced. We ordered fresh guacamole which was made at our table to our liking. We also ordered the carnitas with the coca-cola sauce on the side. The sauce was very sweet so I'm glad we had the choice of how much to put onto our food but it was delicious. Overall I left feeling satisfied and almost stuffed (I definitely take advantage of the chip refills). One of the better Mexican restaurants in town but a little pricey.  On a side note: I have also heard great things about Lindos on Flamingo and Hualipi just west of the 215."}
{"text":"Like so many others have said, the view of Las Vegas is fantastic from this restaurant. The atmosphere is warm and the service was polite and quick.  I thought the food, although good, had room for improvement. I had a steak dish that was a little over sauced which made it difficult to taste the natural flavours.  Prices where fair and nobody left the restaurant hungry. I will be returning to Lindo Michoacan in the future."}
{"text":"The best view in town for sure!  The food is solid.  I really enjoyed the enchilada and taco combo with chicken.  They also have an amazing veggie option for their burritos and enchilada's that is filled with peppers, squash, carrots, and tons of goodness.    I would stay away from the margarita's on the rocks and go blended.  The mix they use is a little sweat.  The beans that come out with the chips for free...a definite bonus."}
{"text":"If your in Vegas and want to enjoy traditional Mexican food this place is worth the visit.. Sopitos steak Chorizo and the griditos de canaron is worth ordering."}
{"text":"This place is a must every time we go to Vegas.  Knew about this place before Food Network.  Service is exemplary.  Even when its packed you get fast service.  Someone is always making sure that you have something to drink.  As soon as you sit down chips, salsa, and refried beans are at your table and after your order is taken you get a bowl of fideo. (take me back to my childhood BOMB!)   Breakfast, lunch or dinner the food is great.  I love the chilaquiles divorciados.  Only place I know that makes that.  Their seafood Chimichanga is da bomb and big.  On Sundays they have a brunch buffet.  It's not the Golden Corral big, but they have good quality food.  They have a full bar (YAY!!!)  The drinks are good and I guess depending on the bartender there is that day you might get a bit more of a kick in your drink.   The atmosphere is lively, and there is usually a one man band playing music.  This is a really nice place to go whether its on a date or a large group of friends."}
{"text":"Hands down Best Traditional Mexican Food in town... Highly recommened. Can be pricey taking the whole familia...& you know mexicans..grandma, tia, tio by the time everyone orders your starving.. not to long before they bring you a small bowl of fideo (soup). Fresh tortillas, cold corona, sizzleing fajitas... wow, im probably gonna go after work."}
{"text":"The meal itself was very disappointing. I had the carnitas and they where not good at all, they lacked flavor and weren't very tender. The horchata was also very bland and I couldn't even finish the drink or food. Would definitely have to think twice before returning to this place."}
{"text":"Service is good! Coffee taste like water Omg 18.95 for chilaquiles con carne asada!! Expensiveeeeeeeeeeee Food is not good, rice taste like left over."}
{"text":"Having been born and raised is Mexico my expectations for Mexican food are pretty high, but I'm really happy to say that this restaurant has met them. This is hands down the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. The service is fantastic and the food is authentic, right down to the sour cream."}
{"text":"Nice servers  Clean business  Free chips with bean and salsa  And then bring a bowl of soup  Nice culture decor  Great food"}
{"text":"This place is an all around OK all american mexican restaurant. I would not consider this traditional cuisine from Mexico at all. Everything we ordered was very bland and not seasoned AT ALL. I had the steak chimichanga, and had to salt the whole thing, including the refried beans, which had zero flavor. We had the queso fundido with chorizo as an appetizer, and it was hands down the best dish of the night, but very small in portion. The place is very overpriced for the food that you get. Both of us agreed at the end of the meal that we would've been better off at Roberto's or even Chipotle."}
{"text":"Not real impressed. Hubby and I were craving Mex so I suggested that we try a different place.  Very nice hostesses they greeted us and sat us immediately. We ended up sitting in a cozy booth in a back room.  I noticed a smell right away. Like a dirty dishcloth...we should have left right then.  Anyway the best and honestly only good part of the meal was the table side guacamole.   Hubby got a grilled vegetable wet burrito and I got the guac tacos. Bean dip was bland, hubby's burrito the vegetables were old and burnt, like they were re-grilled. My tacos...the rice was bland and hard...the beans again were bland.  I ordered a margarita on the rocks with salt... and it tasted like what Pine-Sol smells like...not good. Zero tequila taste.   The three stars were for the guacamole alone...otherwise this place is zero stars...but honestly I will not return for the guac. The place just plain smells :("}
{"text":"Since my sister lives in the LV, I've been able to hit this off-the-strip, real deal Mexican spot a couple of times when visiting her. It's refreshing to eat at a Mexican restaurant that is not upscale, without gimmicks, and has tasty margaritas. They also have an extensive menu with all kinds of yummy-sounding options, although their veggie selection is pretty thin. For an appetizer, try to the nopalitos--grilled cactus with onions that you wrap up in their homemade tortillas--delicious! Plus nopalitos is so fun to say. Nopalitos! My enchiladas verdes were very satisfying, though not the best I've ever had. Still, I will make it a point to eat at Lindo Michoacan next time I visit Vegas, especially on that last day when being on the strip for another moment might make me choke the 200th girl I see with a tiny waist and balloon-like double D's."}
{"text":"I don't get this place.....been here more than enuf times to say \"I don't like the FOOD!!!     It is convenient for us, that's the nicest thing I can say, REALLY! AND they have free parking.    I have tried different things EVERYTIME and BLEH!! Tonight we ordered guacamole (which is prepared table side, nice touch!) our server who I said not to much of jalape√±os or cilantro. He looked at me nodded his head, then Proceeded to ask me about jalape√±os & cilantro..... This server whom we had b4, has a concentration issue. Maybe he's been a server so long he's bored...really don't know but I do know he doesn't pay attention!     I wish I could say something more pleasant, just can't find anything complimentary to say. They're are busy so I guess they're just NOT my kind of Mexican fare~"}
{"text":"When we first moved here from Arizona a couple of months ago we were so excited to find a good Mexican restaurant close to where we live. After three visits to Lindo (we were hoping that the third time would be a charm) we decided that we just can't go back to eat there. The food is just not good and usually comes out cold. Servers are are nice and the view is amazing at night but this place just doesn't cut it. I wish it did!"}
{"text":"There is not a bad item on the menu.  Tonite tried the gorditas de camarones very good, loaded with baby shrimp.  Mariachi band was great!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant great view and really good service but NOT impressed with the food at this location. I ordered the taco trio and the fish tacos tasted like dirt , talapia is bad but this really tasted like dirt, even the guacamole didn't taste the same. I had dinner at the one in Summerlin and it was excellent. Seems like they have to get on the same page. I heard the one on Decatur is really good also , will try that one next time."}
{"text":"Love this place been many times great race shell salad with carnitas just fantastic best anywhere"}
{"text":"So usually I wait to do reviews til after I eat.. but the service is so good, God damnit I'm gonna do it while im eating lol. We called 20min ahead to reserve and got seated immediately. Miguel and Andre are refilling our waters literally every 5min.. and also the chips and salsa too. We barely went without empty glasses. I got the Cobb salad and bae got some carne asada plate thing... and  The food came out super quick too, less than 15min! Still eating so.. gotta get back to the food. Adios motha fuckas!!! :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place. We have tried so many Mexican restaurants here (I'm a Mexican food snob from Southern CA) and this place is always great. From the food to the service-bomb. Our food is never greasy and they aren't stingy with the \"good stuff\" in our margaritas. This is our #1 spot! P.S. if you get lucky and get a window seat, you can view the strip!"}
{"text":"Really nice dinner! Views! This place is huge and at 4pm on Saturday packed, but we got a nice window seat in front. Server Roberto was nice, friendly. Lots of staff bustling about. Prompt attentive. Family friendly and not too quiet, everyone having a great time, lots of celebrations can be heard going on. Great decor. Chips and salsa, bean dip great. Nice cup of soup served with all orders and it was pretty tasty. Ala Carte chili relleno and Carne asada burritto were very good. Fresh corn tortillas served were great with leftover bean dip. Preparada was ok, will try Michelada next time. Next time we will go for Menudo breakfast. Looking forward to another visit soon. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Outstanding place!  I lived in Las Vegas for two years, and Lindo Michoacan never got old, nor empty.  This is by far the best Mexican spot in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place that it had great food, I came here with my family and tried it. The service was excellent but none of the food had flavor, and the salad had way to much. The soup was awesome! If you've never had real Mexican food I'd suggest this place for a quick bite not a good place to go if you want the real expeiriance."}
{"text":"Finally able to check this place out and see what all the buzz was about.  It is great!  From the chips, salsa and bean dip, to the Cadillac Margarita everything was amazing!  This place was PACKED on a Wednesday evening around 8pm and now I know why.  Its really that good and the servers somehow handle everything and dont leave you feeling like you are left out with the place so packed.  Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years!! The service food and drinks are amazing!! My favorite is the tamales and grilled shrimp tacos! I also love the chili rims they put on margaritas and beers by request. I look forward to coming here every week. I definatley know good Mexican I am from so cal.. In conclusion don't confuse this place with Michocan in Cenntenial Hilld.. Lindo Michocan is way way better I have dined at both!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Vegas!! The soup that they start you off with is so tasty I loved it! We also tried the freshly made guacamole with chips and WOW! I had to have the  camarones borrachos (drunk shrimp) and they were great!! We are definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend who is as crazy about Mexican food as I am, and neither of us were disappointed. Their hot sauce wasn't hot enough for him, so they brought out some of their super-scorching ghost pepper sauce. My friend loved it. The burritos were huge. The quesadillas made homestyle. The service was impeccable, despite having a number or large groups there that day. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great service for the time we arrived til the time we left. Great food !! And beer !!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended this place they have amazon lunch deals, inside it can fit tons of people! Lots of space for big parties, the views are amazing of the strip! The drinks are on point! The chips and bean dip are amazing! Burritos here are super big! Overall one of the best places for Mexican food in Las Vegas! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place has excellent food and even better service! I like the shredded beef wet burrito and the Organic margarita, 1/2 off during happy hour, was amazing!!! I eat here a lot but dined in for the first time yesterday! My mom and I absolutely loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is good. The service is good, not perfect, but not bad. They accommodated our large family birthday party with no problem, though I did make reservations in advance. They sing a birthday song and place a sombrero on the birthday boy's (in our case) head and give him a shot of tequila too. We had fun."}
{"text":"my experience here in vegas waz awesom the service waz slow but once they get your attention....then the respect iz well worth the wait and the food waz delish....coming from a latin breed ...excellent service 2 bad itz all the way in vegas we had 20 pplz on the guest list coming from a wedding my true friend had the food here delish ...will be bacc nxt tyme i'm n vegas"}
{"text":"View of the Strip - amazing!  Service - great.  Taste - Good.  Pricing - adequate.  More of a place for good Mexican food when you're looking for a great atmosphere to have it in.  Save this place for a special occasion where you have a hankering for Mexican"}
{"text":"We (party of 8) had a 5:30 PM reservation. When we walked in we noticed plenty of tables available. After waiting 10 minutes, we asked the young ladies at the desk and were told it would be a few more minutes. As more and more people came in and were added to the list, all being told 15-20 minutes wait, we asked again when we would be seated. Needless to say, the tables in the center of the restaurant stood empty. At that time we were told that they were waiting for a party of 44! Who takes a reservation for 44 people on Saturday at a popular neighborhood restaurant leaving 20 to 30 people on various size groups waiting for tables? After another 10 minutes, it is now after 6PM, the tables are still empty, the crowd getting bigger we were told it would be a few more minutes. With that, we made a reservation for another local restaurant and told them we were leaving. The manager and one of his staff chased us out to the parking lot telling us our table was ready now. Really? And, when we left, the 44 people still had not shown up. Very poor management! My friends and I will never return to this place."}
{"text":"ambiance is energetic. spectacular view of the vegas strip, but not a very romantic place since it does get quite bustling.  food is very good. service is friendly. the dishes appear pricy but the portions are HUGE. 2 entrees for 3 people should be sufficient. the hubby and I ordered one entree each and after getting a bit too excited with their delicious chips and salsa, we pretty much had one full entree left over after we were done. will definitely visit again. seems very group/family friendly as well.  oh, the only \"bad\" thing was that parking was limited. honestly, their parking lot is a reasonable size, but it does seem to get very crowded, even on weeknights."}
{"text":"We were here on Cinco De Mayo to celebrate! Service was decent, the main server wasn't that great but the bus boy was great! It was an hour and a half wait so we sat outside and ordered a couple buckets of beer. No problem waiting. 2 hours went by and had to ask what's going on and they said some confusion and sat us right away. So they took an error and corrected it, thank you for that. Food was good, atmosphere is great and service is decent. Nothing spectacular about service for me. I'm huge on service during a visit at a place so I usually verbalize service more then food... I would come back again!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch yesterday and was really impressed. After reading all the Yelp reviews, I was hesitant to try it but I am glad that I did. The service was excellent - very attentive and friendly. The food was pretty amazing. I ordered the lengua tacos - and it was tender and flavorful. They give you fresh chips with beans and salsa too. My husband ordered the carne asada and it was really tender and had a great flavor. We also tried the nachos and that was good - very cheesy, the chicken that we added to it was juicy. We'll definitely check it out again to try other items on their menu (their menu is large - hundreds of options - even for vegetarians!)."}
{"text":"I was invited to a dinner at your Henderson location last night and once again I attempted to order the Cry Today, Cry Tomorrow for $20.95. The waiter looked at me and said are you sure !?!? He asked me 2 times, again making a scene out of a very simple request. I pulled out my phone and showed him my previous YELP review showing that I was refused the Cry Today, Cry Tomorrow. I told him to just please just place the order. I had to assure him that I would not return the item.  When he picked up my plate he made a rude and racial comment that I was the only \"gringo\" that he has seen finish the meal. He said that he had 3 \"gringos\" order it and not finish it before me.  Also we ordered 2 margaritas and 1 beer that were never delivered. We where not charged for them so we did not complain.   All I want to do is to place an order for an item on your menu without a hassle. What is the problem with your severs ? You lost $30 in liquor because they were too worried about the \"gringo\"'s order.  You should just take this item off the menu if you are unwilling to serve it."}
{"text":"I had the chilaquiles and they were okay. I was expecting something a little bit better but I could have ordered this dish at a mom-and-pop place and it would taste the same. Service was good though."}
{"text":"Every time we come it's always busy so we decided to phone ahead so we wouldn't have to wait twenty minutes for a table. Worked out well, we got in and as others waited we got sat right away with a beautiful view. As busy as it was service was great! Only downfall some of the entrees can be a bit pricey for a local restaurant and I felt like the shrimp wasn't enough on my dish. But it was delicious none the less. Very good service even though it was busy!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere, food, and drinks at this restaurant. I don't often get alcoholic drinks with my meals. I have very specific restaurant settings were I feel drinks are in order - and this is one of them! I love their cadillac margarita's. I have such a difficult time in Vegas getting a margarita that is made right (i.e., not too sweet, not too sour). At Lindo Michoacan they know how to make a margarita.   My favorite item on the menu, believe it or not, is the table-side guacamole. I know, it is just an appetizer - but it is the best appetizer! I used to have an avocado tree in my backyard growing up in Miami, so I miss avocados and love guacamole that is freshly made. I have had too many guacamole's that taste pasty or bland, but not here. They spice it up to your liking - so I have them dump in the bowl of onions & jalape√±o's. They also have really awesome refried bean dip that comes with the chips. It is a perfect combination for a pre-dinner appetizer that mixes scrumptiously with my margarita and entr√©e later.  For entr√©es, I enjoy the chicken chimichanga, steak & shrimp fajitas, and fish street taco's. Some of the items are a little pricy. But, they serve all meals with Mexican soup and chips & salsa with refried beans. Many Mexican restaurants these days have been tacking on a separate fee for chips & salsa. So, I factor this in to the dining experience. Plus, I appreciate not being nickeled-and-dimed. When I start to feel like everything I want has a separate charge (e.g., sauces, chips, refill drink), I lose interest in the dining experience.   The restaurant does have a Mariachi band that plays at night and walks about the restaurant.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Food is a little pricey, but overall yummi. i got an enchilada plate. They give you chips and beans before your food and they give you more if you ask. My plate came with noodle soup (fideo) could be more Mex style if they add cream and avocado. They have music. It was a little crowded for dinner but a must for birthdays let them know and they sing Marachi and they put a hat on you and force a tequila drink on you!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I even give them two stars. You are supposed to pay for what you get.! Well, the building and the atmosphere is great. The chicken enchiladas where dry, and warm. I guess the microwave was not working.. The chips are store bought, and salsa only one kind hot. Fideo soup was hot and tasty. Never again even if offered for free. My husbands meal had yellow rice, it smell of perfume? Did they get it from leftovers? A nightmare meal!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Mexican food I've ever had. The fresh guacamole made at the table for us was delicious and the tortillas were amazing. I ordered the pollo con tomate estillo \"zirahuen\" which turned out to be thinly sliced chicken breast covered in an onion, tomato-cream sauce. So delicious. The carne asada was also popular with our group- a large, albeit thin, steak that everyone agreed was cooked perfectly, even the picky medium-rare steak eater was delighted. We were made to feel welcome from before we even entered the establishment when we were greeted and assured that they were happy to serve our large group and remained attentive throughout our meal. Been to Vegas 3 times and have paid as much as $400 for a meal for two- but this was the best meal I have ever enjoyed in Vegas. Delicious."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, good food and delicious drinks! Definitely a great place for cocktails after work on a Friday!"}
{"text":"Top shelf service and food. I wish it was cheaper but then I realized you get what you pay for. Amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"GARLIC!!! In the Pescado ajillo- fish in garlic sauce yum! If I didn't fill up on the complimentary chips, salsa & beans, I probably would've finished my plate. Server made a few mistakes- forgot 1 meal, forgot to substitute my fideo soup for a house salad, didn't ask us if we wanted a refill on chips. (Did they change the chips? Seems thicker than what I remembered) He seemed to be busy with many tables. I do appreciate that we were able to call ahead for a large party. Definitely a plus for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"The best Sonoran Mexican restaurant I've found in Vegas.  Chips and salsa are great.  Big portions. Buoy will not leave hungry!"}
{"text":"LOVE the staff more than the food. However the food is still good but they have gone down a little which is why I am not giving them five stars. They have the best service and that is what keeps drawing me back plus the margaritas are delicious"}
{"text":"Conveniently located for me when I am in the mood for Mexican food, which is pretty much all the time.  My only hang up is that it can get pretty expensive depending on how many people are in your party.  Of all the locations in the Lindo empire, this one provides a most impressive view of valley.  I think that it might also be the loudest.  The acoustics make it very hard to hear.  Add the Mariachi band or the resident guitar player banging out a version of Marty Robinson's \"El Paso\" to the mix and you really have yourself incredibly LOUD fiesta.  I have never ordered anything bad from the menu.  I always leave fat, dumb and happy.  On my most recent outing I ordered Novillo Al Jerez.  This was a deliciously marinated (some kind of sweet Mexican wine) steak with crumbled bacon on it.  Yes...Bacon.  A staple appetizer is the Queso Fundido.  Unless you have a six pack or are lactose intolerant, who doesn't like gooey cheese with homemade tortillas?  I was also feeling like I wanted a margarita and so I ordered one.  The waiter suggested that I get a Cadillac margarita.  I took him up on his suggestion. It was fair and imagine when I got the bill and found out that it cost me $12 and I didn't even get a buzz!  Way to up sale Ivan!  As much as I would like to eat here more, I fear that I would end up fat, dumb and broke."}
{"text":"Literally the best food and service you'll ever have. The waiters never forget you or make you wait to ask for something, seafood and carnitas is always perfect, the flan is incredible, even the WATER tastes good. If you can get a seat by the window you'll have an amazing view of the entire valley. Only cons is that it's a pretty popular place for dinner and you might not be able to find parking at all, go early!"}
{"text":"I had the Mole poblano and it honestly tasted just like mom used to make! The chicken was tender and seasoned well, and the sauce was mild in spice with a touch of chocolate. The service here is tops too. Our very informed waiter was able to answer all of our questions including a little history in the restaurant and kitchen staff that runs the place! I loved this place and will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This past Saturday we had my Nana's 90th birthday celebration here. From the time we originally booked the private room for the guests, all the way through to the end of the party, this restaurants was AMAZING!   My family and I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant and their staff. They catered to our family and friends so wonderfully, I didn't have to worry about anything; and there was about 50 of us! Anything we needed, they got it. No one had empty drinks. Food was ready on time, brought out cake when asked, etc. They accommodated our every request. This celebration of my Nana's 90 years couldn't have been any better. How great it was to have someone else do the work, all we had to do was show up and enjoy ourselves. Every single employee was amazing.  Oh and the happy birthday song from all the staff with the guy and the guitar, my Nana loved it.   Thank you Lindo Michoacan for taking such good care of us and helping our family to create some wonderful memories with our Nana."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming to this Lindo Michoacan location. I was told the views are amazing and it's so true. I was very disappointed with my Red Chilaquiles, nothing on the plate was good, like at their other location on Desert Inn. My families whole meal Expirience was uneventful as well, since they also did not enjoy their food. The great service that made our stay here bearable today was waiter and the buser, these two gentlemen were attentive and very professional. This low rating was only bases on the food taste and quality. I also was pleasantly surprised when I saw the ample parking space. I might not be back here and just go to their other location."}
{"text":"Once again, I come to Lindo Michuacan and have an amazing experience. I find parking like I am king, since theres ample parking. I walk in and skip the hoates, sorry beautiful ladies. I walk straight to the bar and I am greated by Maggie and Renata our bartender for the night. Maggie recommended amazing mescal shots with a orange slice which was the best recommendation I had in a long time.  Thank you Renata for our mixed well drink. I can Honestly say that you both made my night even more memorable. I will see you both next week."}
{"text":"Heard about this place on the Food Network. I love spicy food and couldn't wait to try the \"Cry today, Cry tomorrow\". I was excited when we were invited to a friend's birthday party tonight. I couldn't wait to try it.   (I love spicy food to the point that I make my own salsa because the store bought stuff isn't hot enough)  When I ordered, the waiter told me that he was Mexican and couldn't even eat it. He told me that I shouldn't order it and try something else. (I guess he said this because I am white ?)  I told him it was ok.  The waiter then asks if I had tried it before. Well, there has to be a first time for everything. Let me try it !  Again, he refused. He said I should just pick something else on the menu and he will bring me a side of the sauce.  No, I want it just like the menu describes it !!!!  At this point everyone else at the table was looking at me because I was delaying the order for the other 16 people in our party.  I finally became irritated that I was being treated like a 3yr old and he was telling me what I can and can't eat. I just ordered a Quesadilla in hopes that he would allow me to order it.   He did bring a side of the sauce which I was left to dip chips in. It was indeed hot, but not as hot as advertised. It had a decent flavor. I ended up taking the Quesadilla apart to get the steak out and dipping it in the sauce.   I left very disappointed that I couldn't order the meal that was on Food Network.  I left very disappointed that I couldn't order the $20.99 meal that was listed on the menu.  I left very disappointed that I couldn't order the single item that made them prominently display the Food Network logo on the outside of their building.  I could have just gone to Taco Bell for a Quesadilla.  DO NOT GO HERE EXPECTING TO GET THE \"CRY TODAY, CRY TOMORROW\", they will refuse to serve it."}
{"text":"We went for my wife's birthday dinner and it was great! We had reservations and were quickly seated in a great spot to see the lights of Vegas and enjoyed chips, salsa and bean dip. Dinner was excellent and the service was prompt. The menu has everything you could want and more unique dishes than anywhere else for Mexican food. To finish the celebration our server and staff all sang a birthday song, gave my wife a tequila shooter, fresh churro's and made her wear a sombrero. Fun, festive, and did I say, amazing food!"}
{"text":"Let me just say WOW. This place was recommended to me be a local family member and it by far exceeded my expectectations. I went with my brother and my one year old niece, and the staff was incredibly attentive and made sure we were taken care of. We sat by the windows and had a beautiful view of the city, including the strip. I tend to make assumptions about how the food will be based on the salsa they start you off with and the salsa here was really good. The mango margarita was so close to heaven. I was happy with the variety of dishes they offered and ended up ordering the shrimp stuffed chiles rellenos. I really want to highlight how amazing the staff was though. They all worked as a team and made our visit very pleasant."}
{"text":"Great service great food. No complaints at all. Highly recommended. The food tastes good. Its well cooked and the service staff are very friendly. They make you feel like if you are home."}
{"text":"First things first:  in spite of giving only three stars, I want to go back.  I want to give it another try because we really enjoyed the food and drinks and would like to try that again.  My meal was simple; I had two beef tacos and a cheese enchilada.  It came with a tomato-based noodle soup that we both enjoyed, plus rice and beans.  My husband had some kind of chile relleno with shrimp, which was delicious--both of our meals were very good, and we both enjoyed Cadillac Margaritas on the rocks.  Everything came in a timely manner.  The drawbacks:  we made a reservation at 7:00, and arrived a few minutes before.  First the hostess says she does not have our reservation.  No one called, no...oh wait, the spelling is what?  (I should add that our last name is very simple and common.)  Oh, okay, well...wait just a few minutes.  The place was packed, hot, and very very loud.  There was nowhere to sit to wait, and \"a few minutes\" stretched into 45--at which point we went to the hostess and told her we were leaving.  \"I'm seating you right now!\" she told us, and they did come within 3 minutes after that.    After that, things were much better, as stated above.  Things we disliked:  the confusion about the reservation, the long wait, the NOISE--it's so very noisy!--and the restroom could have been better maintained.  This seems to be a family place, so look out for a LOT of kids.  One other thing I had a problem with:  the menu is huge and the restaurant lighting is fairly low, and the small, red print is very difficult to read in that light.  But we will go back, probably much earlier than 7 - 8pm, because that seems to be when the rush is.  I'd like to try the guacamole...and I'll be taking a flashlight so I can see the menu!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was full of Mexican customers! Need I say more"}
{"text":"I normally go to the Lindo in Centennial Hills, but this one is MUCH better! Everything was filled with lots of great flavor, including the chips with salsa and bean dip!  However, the meal was not AS good, but still enjoyable.   The biggest downer from my perspective was the cramped environment, but that's great for them! Even with it being really busy,  the staff was friendly and accommodating...one of my friends has a gluten allergy, and they were very attentive with her needs as well!"}
{"text":"Having moved to Vegas last August, I was pretty sure I wasn't going to miss anything about LA. Well, turns out, I do miss several things about LA, but, number 1, hands down, is the Mexican food.  My wife and I came here several nights ago, and seriously, I'm still sad that THIS is considered the best Mexican food Vegas has to offer. We ordered several entree's, cause that's how we roll when we try new places, plus, we have food for a day or two more at home!  We ordered a combo plate that included a pork burrito, beef enchilada and a chicken taco. The carnitas plate. Street taco plate, and bacon wrapped shrimp.  The issue I have with ALL their food hands down, is that it was all just bland. From the beginning of the meal, the bean dip, blah. The salsa, blah. Then onto the entree's, just all flat. To the point where I started to get really sad. I love Mexican food, it's like my number 2 favorite cuisine, and I was sad because, THIS place is considered to be greatness.   The chef/owner has the audacity to plaster his face all over the menu, which is all fine, but you better come correct with your flavors. You're not on Iron Chef, you're not chef Gordon Ramsay. If your picture is on every other page, I expect your food to be mind blowing.   The best thing we had, was the carnitas, and again, not because of flavor, but because of how well it was cooked, temperature wise. It wasn't over or undercooked, as most places that serve carnitas fall under. It had nicely caramelized edges, but still moist. I just wish they had a pantry in the kitchen with herbs and spices.  This is all I'm saying to the owners/managers of this restaurant, please take a day trip to Los Angeles and head to a restaurant called Salsa and Beer, they have two locations. They have the BEST Mexican food, north of the border, and also, check out their pricing. Salsa and Beer is what I expected this place to be, but it wasn't even close.  If this is what Vegas has to offer as far as Mexican, I'm screwed. Also, it means there's a HUGE opening for someone to open a kick-ass Mexican restaurant, cause this ain't cutting it.  PS - My wife just brought something to my attention. With ALL the food we ordered, we didn't take a single thing home with us. As I mentioned earlier, we usually order multiple plates when going somewhere new, so that we can basically \"sample\" the restaurant. That being said, without even thinking about it, when our server came around and asked if we wanted to take anything, I instantly said no. If you know me, you know that's extremely unusual. I'll often even take things I wasn't impressed with home with me, in hopes of \"fixing\" them.   Two stars for atmosphere, and their margaritas are good, I'd come back and just drink at the bar.  Food: 1 Ambience: 4 Service: 3 Value: 1"}
{"text":"Every time we have been here it has been delicious food and amazing service. You can't beat the views. Manny has taken care of us every time we have come in. We have never asked for him but have been lucky to get him. He even had them make me a white wine sangria as I can't have red wine. It was delicious, Can't wait to go back. Always a pleasure!"}
{"text":"We loved the design and decor of this Mexican restaurant and we had high hopes based on the reviews and buzz. We arrived at 4:50pm on a Friday which turned out to be 10 minutes before happy hour ended. The restaurant was already getting busy, and our server scrambled to make sure we got our drinks at the happy hour half-price which we appreciated very much - $5.00 for Javier's Margarita and $2.75 for an ice-cold pint of draft Pacifico. These happy hour drink prices alone make OLM one of the best values in Las Vegas, and as we perused the fantastic menu with many dishes we had never seen or heard of before it looked like we were heading into an easy 5-star experience. The food, unfortunately, changed all that.  When we were seated we were served fresh tortilla chips, warm bean dip, and pinkish salsa that had a bit of a bite. I thought all were great but my GF thought the salsa tasted odd and \"off\" somehow.   For the past several days we had been doing a Queso Fundido with chorizo tour around Las Vegas, trying this dish at a variety of area Mexican restaurants, and we were looking forward to trying OLM's version. OLM charges $8.50 for plain Queso Fundido and you can add chorizo for $1.00 more. We ordered this and when it arrived we could see no chorizo in the dish. We poked around in it and it turned out they had put a tiny amount (perhaps a bit less than a teaspoon) of chorizo underneath the top layer of cheese. The tiny crumbles of chorizo we were able to locate were barely enough to taste, but when we did get a taste it was very good. To the management of Original Lindo Michoacan: we would gladly have paid an extra $2.50 for a decent amount of chorizo in your Queso Fundido. This is typically what your competitors charge for a more generous amount, and by charging only $1.00 for this and then appearing to skimp on it and not really deliver it to your customers you are shooting yourselves in the foot.  After drinks, chips, and queso we were getting full and we really had no room left for a huge plate of food. So we ordered a single, a la carte Al Pastor taco in order to see how well OLM does with Al Pastor which is another one of our Mexican favorites. We have had some absolutely spectacular Al Pastor in Las Vegas at many restaurants and taco shops, and again we were looking forward to tasting OLM's version.  The taco arrived and it was pathetic. It was really just little nuggets of gristly pork fat with virtually no Al Pastor flavor or color at all. Ugh. We were left wondering how a restaurant with the reputation and following that OLM has could fail so badly with this Mexican staple. Oh well.   Original Lindo Michoacan gets 3.5 stars for our first visit. They had everything in place for an easy 5 stars but the kitchen made sure that didn't happen. We are willing to return once more during happy hour to give their kitchen another chance by trying some other items on their really interesting menu, and to again enjoy some of their well-priced drinks. However, we now realize that Original Lindo Michoacan may emerge as the best choice for happy hour drinks only, and at 5:00pm we'll need to move on to another place for some Mexican food."}
{"text":"Everytime we visit Vegas we fill up here. Great cure for a hangover, aguachiles, michelada, and oysters. Everything is so good and taste so fresh. Maybe its the booze but I am always impressed with their food, service, and authenticity. It's off the strip but most cab drivers know it. They also offer you free transportation back to your hotel if it is available!!"}
{"text":"We often golf at Desert Willow, and pass this restaurant on the way home. One day we stopped in for lunch. We sat at the bar, which along with a portion of the dining room, overlooks the valley and the strip. Views are beautiful, and I bet at night, it is really amazing. Being gambling degenerates, we threw a couple of $20s in and the machines are very tight! We asked the bartender if they are always this tight, and she said \"Someone hit a royal a couple of weeks ago\", well, that is pretty tight if you ask me! So gambling there = no. Now for the service, very good. Attentive and very friendly bartender, and since we were foolishly gambling, the drinks were on the house. And the food... my husband ordered the Sopa 7 Mares, which is a seafood soup. It was loaded with beautiful seafood and was really good. I ordered the Menudo, which is a tripe and hominy soup. The interesting thing is that they don't put hominy in the soup unless you ask for it added, which I found very odd. But it was good after they brought me a bowl of hominy to add.   We went here again with some tourist friends, and sat in the dining room overlooking the strip. Pretty good food, but I have to be honest, not the best. I am from San Diego, where there are no shortage of excellent Mexican restaurants. This place doesn't compare to any of them. And the prices are quite high for what you get. We haven't been there since, and probably won't return."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food.   What we liked: large menu with lots of selections to choose from.  Many very authentic recipes from the soup, beef Colorado  to the fresh beef tongue.  Large portion.  The servers were prompt and friendly.  We had reservations and our table was ready when our party arrived.  We love the authentic atmosphere with empty tequila bottles of all brands on display    We especially enjoyed the chicken fajitas, the garlic chicken (Gallo Mojo de Ajo), the steak Chile Colorado. Mole  Ploblano The flan was also very good.  Dinner prices ranged from $15-$19.   What we didn't like:  the restaurant is noisy and some tables are noisier than others.  We were near the live music so it was noisier this trip.  The traffic from 5 -6 pm will make it a 35 min taxi ride from the strip.   So consider a later dinner.   We really enjoy ever meal we've had here."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here a couple times before but coming here on Cinco De Mayo was a great idea. The service was awesome & the food was great. It was SUPER busy and very packed and I can see why. They had great deals on drinks, like a beer & shot for $10? Um yes! Very good. Worth going for sure."}
{"text":"What the heck happened?!!! This place was one of our favorites, but recently the food is crappy. The sauce is bright red, and overly tomatoey, the guacamole had so many onions in it, it was tough to eat. Will never go back!"}
{"text":"Verrryyy fast service ! Sat down immediately got chips salsa and beans . Got drinks on the fly ! Felt like me and my boyfriend are eating in Mexico . Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant ! Camarones sarandeados or steak a la cognac  delicious ! Also margarita with corona excellent I love the service the nachos with the refried beans and the hot sauce love it ! I always go there when I'm in a mood for Mexican food"}
{"text":"Ate here the other night and several times before than ! Food is average with chips , salsa and bean dip . Atmosphere is a little loud at times and the view is amazing at night !!   The Marinara Ensalada is always awesome with avocado, shrimp and pico ! Love the freshness of it ! Service is always good with many helping out to ensure your drinks are full and the table stays clean !"}
{"text":"I came in for dinner and this being the first time I didn't know what to expect. I ordered the nachos and the server was in a hurry. I knew at this point it was going to be wrong. 15 minutes later guess what, your right if you guessed they were wrong. I told them they forgot my meat which is a 3$ difference in price from regular nachos. They took the dish and just added meat and more more cheese and ran it under the broiler again thus burning the twice cooked chips to a rock hard delicacy. With all this said 20 minutes later I am brought out my food and my gf is all most done eating her food. Kind of beats the purpose of eating as a couple. Use my experience as a reference as I'm not biased or influenced just sharing my experience."}
{"text":"Went in for Valentine's Day. Party of 5, waited 45 min and ready to be seated.  As we head for the table, our table was snatched by another group.  The young girl that was to sit us down felt bad and spoke with the Manager. A few min later we were all sitting with the lower window view of the strip.  I ordered the cognac marinated streak.  SO GOOD!!!  Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"The Original Lindo Michoacan...What can I say, the food is authentic Mexican, with wonderful service. Our table was cleared and ready for the next customer before we had even paid our bill during our most recent visit. The busser kept our ice tea glasses so full I ran out of Splenda trying to keep mine sweet. I may sound like I am complaining or being pissy but I really am not.   The food here truly is good. I have never had a bad meal and the service is always spot on, but they are so focused on turning over the tables they forget that their customers might like to take longer than thirty minutes to eat dinner. The roving band of musicians can be loud and annoying but it is meant to add to the authenticity. Since I have never been to Mexico I cannot say if the locals wander around singing while people eat or not.   I had Chicken Enchilada with Mole and my husband had the Coke-Cola Carnitas, I believe. Mine was good. But as usual, his was great. I love that Coke-Cola sauce. It is delicious. The table side guacamole is always a winner, but I prefer my chips to be lighter so while they do a great good I tend not to order it here. If you enjoy the free basket they start you off with, go for the guacamole.   The Original is just what it says...and there is a reason it has won so many Best of Las Vegas awards. so check it out."}
{"text":"Outstanding service, excellent food & wonderful drinks. Great hidden hidden view, sit at bar or behind bar to see the city lights. Will come again."}
{"text":"First time here. Chilaquiles w eggs was ok. Huevos rancheros were good. Prices are good. Service was not the best, took a while to have my drink refilled (by someone other than our server) n never saw our server till the end of the meal. Wld suggest U try it at least once and make your own decision. I will come bck again but not as a regular."}
{"text":"This Mexican restaurant at Flamingo near Hualapai is very good. We went there for lunch recently, and though the welcome at the front desk by two very young gals was lackluster, our waiter was courteous, affable and efficient. The chile relleno/tamale/enchilada combination plate was perfectly prepared, with authentic refried beans and Spanish rice. The lunch crowd included two tables of serious business people, which suggested that the place is a local favorite for luncheon meetings. The d√©cor is rustic and classic old Mexican, with charming artifacts presented in tasteful fashion here and there. The salsa, an important component of any Southwestern meal, had the right combination of flavor and heat. I could easily eat lunch at this branch of Lindo Michoacan every week, it is that appealing. See my photos of the place's unique, stately exterior."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to have a quick drink last minute. We arrived around 10ish so it wasn't too busy. There was no wait and we were seated right away with an amazing view. We were checked on frequently and food was served in a timely manner. Overall great service!"}
{"text":"I believe it was the one on Flamingo Rd that my family and I visited, either way don't waste your time. That little voice we all have spoke to me right when we walked in, \"the view is beautiful, therefore the food is going to suck\". You were right again little voice! Also, the \"drink replenisher\" made a statement \" I only have two tables, well then he should of been able to keep our drinks filled! The reason it gets three stars is due to the guacamole and carnitas being decent."}
{"text":"This review depresses me because I really wanted to like this place. Let's start with the service: slow, unfriendly, and terrible. The best service came from the bus boys who circulate and clean our table and refill our drinks. The only friendly people we encountered that night. Chips and salsa: salsa had a nice kick to it but had zero flavor. Same with the bean dip. Nothing special, you can buy a better one in the chip section of your grocery store. I came here for handmade tortillas which are popular in San Diego so I guess my bar was set pretty high anyway. However these were probably the worst tortillas I've had. I would have rather had the ones that I buy from the grocery store. For one they are not fresh which they don't advertise so that's fine but they were super dry and just not good. The queso fundido was okay nothing special but very stingy with the chorizo. My partner got the Carnitas plate which he said was flavorless and dry. I got the beef fajitas which were also flavorless and dry. I literally ate three beef strips and could not stomach the rest. When I bite into the beef the inside is pure white because it is so overcooked, tough and ridiculously dry with a zero flavor. it went to waste because I took it home thinking I could make it better with some salsa and sour cream but it still tasted like rubber so it was a wasted meal. I guess I would understand more if their prices were lowered to accommodate for the non seasoned and over cooked food, however it is pretty pricey for the low quality that you get. I do not recommend this place if you like authentic flavorful Mexican food. And obviously if you're on a budget this is not the place to go. even going through the reviews I did not believe that a place could not have flavor and have so many reviews on how is overcooked and dry their meat is. But my initial thought was well who can mess up beef fajitas it's literally a stir fry. WRONG. I seriously cannot get over how bad it was. :( I wanted to like this place but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Will defiantly return again! First time here and the service was amazing! Drinks and food was great and especially our servers! Thank you for a great first experience and for celebrating my brothers graduation with us."}
{"text":"Always great service. Tried their Sangr√≠a for the first time, it was good!"}
{"text":"Best service! Always a must try stop here whenever I'm Vegas! Although, always busy, serve is always exceptional. Jose \"chino\", Daniel, and the manager were so busy but still very attentive to serving all our needs. A party of 6 and they were keen on recognizing what we might need before we even made requests. I was indecisive as to what to eat, but Daniel recommended \"el platillo de plata\", if my memory serves me right, but it was amazingly delicious this plate could honestly feed two people. It was a beef, chicken, and shrimp plate that was to die for. I must also mention the live music that was playing during our stay that was icing on the cake because they played great hits. From beginning to end it was a delightful experience. Thank you Lindo Michoac√°n!"}
{"text":"I don't know any Mexican place could really be better. This place was delicious. Fast and friendly waitstaff. Says its world famous and on multiple TV shows/media and food prices why!"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing. But the view of this location is phenomenal. Great location to have drinks with a special someone."}
{"text":"Best Mexican Food in the USA. So lucky to live in Las Vegas again to be able to go to this little gem. The seafood is to die for. Their lunch specials are very fairly priced and huge portions!"}
{"text":"Amazing place with amazing food. The staff are very friendly and very attentive to the guests. I had the Steak Ranchero which was recommended by the waiter and I loved it. I have nothing to complain about I highly recommend this place and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Wow! I don't know what happened to the restaurant....but it's not good. The food was bland and tasteless. You're always offered the chips, beans and salsa. This time we received a 1/4 of the bowl full of  salsa (barely enough to dip your chips in), the beans were tepid, but the chips were great! We asked for more salsa and it was delivered directly from the fridge. The main course was equally disappointing. We both had the taco plates (beef and steak). The rice was molded on our plate (cafeteria style) along with bean puree vs. refried beans. The taco meat was completely void of taste. We added cold salsa and salt and pepper to the taco meat for some type of flavor enhancement. We are so disappointed, this was our favorite mexican food restaurant, and so convenient too. If your tying to reduce food costs, I get it, but don't serve premade ice-cold salsa and cafeteria molded rice. We like the authentic that Lindo did so well before."}
{"text":"Nice! Good atmosphere, great service, fantastic food! I'm sorry I waited so long to go there. Their margaritas rock!"}
{"text":"Went today for father's it's one of my fave's spot but today my wife went to the restroom to take my daughter, she came back she had lost her appetite the restroom was disgusting.  They had just brought our food had to take to good.  They won't get my business no more."}
{"text":"We go here as a family 2 or 3 times a month. We love it!  The service is always top-notch! The fideo soup that comes before the entree is delicious.  Food is excellent - always.  If you have any space for dessert, go for it!  They are all great - my favorite is the mango."}
{"text":"Mi primera vez ah√≠ con mis hijos y mis padres Miguel muy trabajador muy amable todos la verdad me encanto ir ah√≠ gracias por su buen servicio al cliente"}
{"text":"I only came here because our friends asked us to join them and I did not know it was this place till we drove up to it, I had gone to the Original one about 8 months ago and it was terrible but the Henderson location is equally as bad. This is an American version of Mexican food and not a very good one. I have no idea who voted this place best Mexican Restaurant but they must have a lack of taste buds. The server German was about the most uniformed and no caring server  on the face of the planet, I kept asking him if things were gluten free, he said he would ask then came back to me and first thought gluten was the same as cheese, then thought that it was avocado. I had to take my chances and order at my own risk. The carnitas was dry and void of flavor, and the fajitas were yucky too. Rice and bean were the worst I ever had, the salsa was bland as hell and the chips were flavorless."}
{"text":"I hate to have to write a bad review, but this place was a huge disappointment to me. The chips and salsa were the only thing good, but it was downhill from there, the food tasted like canned and frozen microwaved crap, and I'm being kind. There are so many good places in Vegas for Mexican food I can't imagine this place being vote one of the best by anyone with taste buds."}
{"text":"Love the food here! We have been here at least 10 times. We live in Salt Lake City, Utah. When we are in Vegas we come here for lunch. I like the chips, salsa & beans before my lunch shows up.  My Dad loves the table side Guacamole! We have found the food to be great and I have not had anything I have not liked or enjoyed a second time. Still many items on the menu that I will try on our next visits here."}
{"text":"Amazing service, food is phenomenal and authentic. Best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to by far."}
{"text":"Went for Taco Tuesday during happy hour- happy hour was half price on the drinks and the margaritas were fantastic! Chicken tacos were delicious, service was good and the view of the city was breathtaking. I went with the watermelon margarita while my friend said the Cadillac was a tasty option. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food. Something recently changed at this particular place; I would have typically given it a 3 and said \"it's okay I guess\" but they've improved the menu somehow. The same foods are now better.   There are still some things on the menu that are a bit bland, or a bit overdone in some particular aspect, but there are others that I've had many times in the past and not really enjoyed (there were just the least-bad option) that I have tried here recently and were quite improved. One specific example is the corn tortilla chicken quesadilla on the appetizer menu. There is a Spanish name for it that I can't remember but it has the word Masa in it. Because of the corn tortillas, you see. These things are now AWESOME. I get them every time I come.   Overall I'm happy to be able to move this up to a 4-star, and whether it's just this one location that is improving or it is a company-wide effort, I applaud it and hope that it continues."}
{"text":"The view is awesome either during the day or night. It's a panoramic view of Las Vegas from Henderson. The food is above average, but the guacamole was dynamite. They make it right at the table with fresh ingredients. My favorite is the fish tacos but the beef ranchero wasn't bad. You can always find a 15% off coupon. Great people and great service."}
{"text":"GREAT food and service.  Truly authentic.  Their salsa is spicy so if you don't particularly care for spicy food, ask for the mild green salsa (also delicious).  This is a great off-strip choice.  Reasonably priced, too."}
{"text":"Pronounced: \"Me-Choke-On\".  Stomach ache after eating here.  When this restaurant used to be located in a much smaller venue, it once had authentic, delicious, purposeful meals.  Now that they've moved to this larger location with no doubt, a great view, I'm not sure what happened.  Hopefully they go back to their good food roots.  Otherwise, maybe better off enjoying the view from the outside."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh this Mexican restaurant is so good the best Mexican restaurant I ever been to,  the atmosphere, the waitresses and waiters,  everyone is excellent I have been here now twice and I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"We're tired of all you can eat buffet & craving Mexican food.  We chose the right place!  Chili rellenos to die for and chicken enchiladas with lots of meat!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Not a large chain, but very similar atmosphere and food as Chevy's or El Torito's.  Still very good food, they make their own tortillas which is always a plus.  I had the chicken fajita which was excellent, especially with hand made tortillas.  They made a special request shrimp burrito for one of our party members which was excellent as well.  Very good service and attention.  They place does get rather noisy during peak hours and especially when there is a birthday to celebrate and the entire staff comes to the table to sing.  There were three diners nearby our table that had birthdays during our dinner and it became rather annoying given how loud they make the celebration.  I would definitely come back for Mexican food craving again."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE Lindo.  Service at the bar by Liz is phenomenal.  She always remembers what we drink, which makes Lindo feel like our second home.  The food is spot-on every time.  I usually order one of the fish dishes, which my friends all tell me is strange at a Mexican restaurant.  However, it is cooked to perfection without fail.  We frequent Lindo a minimum of once and month and have never been disappointed.  Listen up Lindo:  Four stars instead of five only because you took away the live mariachi band, apparently due to the oldster customers complaining about the noise.  I truly hope you bring it back very soon, especially since I can about guarantee the \"youngster\" crowd is spending lots more money than the old-timers."}
{"text":"After several visits to this place I'm still not the biggest fan.  Everything seems just ok.   I will say the view is incredible.  Getting a table along the windows give you the scenic overview of the city with the strip in sight.  Service during the lunch hour is solid.  They were good about refills with several different people checking on our table.    We decided to split the Queso and Chicken Fajitas.  The Queso hardened up quickly. You pretty much had a lump of cheese after the first minute it's sitting on the table.  The chorizo mixed in gave it a good flavor but I wish it was a bit more creamy so it could be dip worthy for longer.    I wish I would have known their Fajitas had cilantro covering the entire plate.  Usually fajitas have a good seasoning without mixing in cilantro on top of it.  I can handle some but it was excessive.  The shells served with it weren't the regular fajita size but almost burrito size. For what I prefer this dish was just ok.    I can always find something else to try but Lindo wouldn't be my first choice for Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food is in the OK-Good range. The location is nice on a hill you can see the Las Vegas valley from. One thing about this place is that it's consistent. The food is always the same , so you know what you are getting. I have been back here several times over the years and I will probably continue to eat here as the place is not bad, most staff is friendly and attentive, once in awhile you run into someone dense, but they don't seem to last long there."}
{"text":"Was told it was a 15 min wait, and ended up waiting 50 min. Once we were in, the service was not impressive. Took another 15 min for waters, and we had to continually ask for refills, more chips, tortillas, etc. For the drinks and chips we had to ask twice because they forgot.  The fajitas were good, not great. I've had better. Atmosphere was chaotic, and far too loud to even hear someone across the table from me.   Just not impressed."}
{"text":"Scrumptious, well made Tex-mex in a fun and quirky environment with good service. What more could you ask for!?   Happy hour is 3-5 and features 1/2 off beer and margaritas. That's ALL the beer and ANY of the margaritas, not just certain ones. Which makes that a great happy hour. I had a Cadillac margarita which was strong and so yummy!   They have an option for fresh table made guacamole which is fantastic! I recommend getting that at least once to compliment the complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip. The fajitas were well made, but slightly bland.   The atmosphere was fun and well decorated. The restaurant is much bigger on the inside, (Dr. Who fans will appreciate) which accounts for the enormous parking lot that seems excessive at first, but is completely understandable once you walk in.   The servers are all in authentic looking garb which is fun and festive. Our water glasses were always full, chips were refilled without asking, and the service was prompt and attentive.   Bonus: Come for your birthday and get a tequila shot!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Cali and we were looking for some authentic Mexican food. This is the place to go, the food was good, generous portions, reasonable prices, clean and the service was great. We didn't have to wait no more than ten minutes or so for our food and enjoyed the mariachi's. For those of you traveling to this area, there's nothing compared to this place unless its home made."}
{"text":"Carnitas!!!! This place is tasty with a great view and speedy service. Many different staff always stop by our table. They are super on top of drink refills and everything. I've been here for lunch and dinner. Both great!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Cinco de Mayo and was surprised there was no specials. We ordered the fresh guacamole that's prepared at our table. We instructed the waiter \"NO onions,\" he nodded and we thought we were clear but when we took our first bite there was a whole lot of onions. Not pleased. I ordered the fish tacos and they were delicious but messy. Our food took way to long to prepare and we could not figure out why as there was hardly anyone in the restaurant at 11AM. Usually the food and service is really excellent but not at this location. I prefer the Henderson location."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town.  Best service and atmosphere.  It's the only Lindo to go to in town, despite the other locations they've opened.  It's the most consistent."}
{"text":"The service was great, the prices were decent, but the food didn't really blow us away like we thought it would considering its \"gourmet\". The bean dip was excellent."}
{"text":"Came to celebrate birthday. Awesome!! Happy environment. Great service! Great food. Awesome happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to this restaurant for the first time last night.  I was worried that we would be waiting for awhile since the parking lot was completely full, but we were able to get right in. It's true the tables are a bit crowded in, but the service was excellent.  They had this lovely mariachi band playing live music and the decor was full of Mexican pottery and plaques.  Very fun atmosphere in which to dine!  The staff was so friendly and nice!  The food was just amazing and very authentic tasting!  My family can't stop talking about their experience dining there!  We will definitely go there again, soon!"}
{"text":"THE best Cadillac Margarita in town!! Great place to celebrate a birthday, especially for someone who has never been there! They will be schocked.... a large number of the staff come over and sing very loudly, put a huge sombrero on you and give you a shot of tequila and a churro. Fun place and amazing view."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for years.  I have always loved it.  I hadn't been there for several months so I was anxious to go.  What a huge disappointment it was the other night when we took friends from out of town to dinner.  They wanted Mexican so naturally I thought of Lindo Michoacan in Henderson.  First of all, it took 27 minutes to get our food.  Secondly, the fajitas were cold. The skillet they brought the fajitas out on was not even warm. The beans and rice looked like they had been cooked the day before and the lettuce was wilted.  I brought this to the attention of the waiter and he offered to take it back.  He brought back another plate of beans and rice and they were just as cold.  I had to go find the manager to tell him what was going on.  He couldn't have cared less.  My husband had ordered a salad and it was awful...how do you screw up lettuce!  None of us ate our food.  Terrible dinner.  I won't go back nor will I ever recommend this place to anyone. It was so loud we couldn't carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"The dish I had was very bland and the meat almost flavorless. The food was very expensive as well, so I find it very difficult to justify such a poor culinary experience. One of the members of my party had a burrito and it contained only meat. I've never seen a plain burrito in my life. This was the first time I visited and it will definitely be the last. Find another place to eat. You'll be thankful you did."}
{"text":"My honey and I love this restaurant! The authenticity was on point! The food is amazing. When we first moved here we  heard about this great view and good food place.  It took us a while to finally check it out. Once we did... We absolutely loved it!  We decided this would be out special restaurant. Now, when anyone comes to visit, I'll make sure to bring them to Lindo.  Oh and the staff is super nice and caring!  They have a great team!"}
{"text":"I drive far to get to Lindo Michoacan, but it's so worth it! Not only is the food awesome, but I was blown away by the fantastic service! You will walk out with a jaw drop! I went with my handicapped 4 yr old niece & there were no problems accommodating her! They even brought out some soup immediately along with the chips, beans & salsa, so not once was the kid bored. The price is good & the portions are big, so you can take half home for another meal! It's eye-pleasing too, it's no whole in the wall, for those of you who like \"a nice place\" to go to. You just gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  The staff is great, the wait staff was very attentive, and the hostes sat us right away. The food is bland and uninspired.  The chips were great but the \"salsa\" was chipolte like flavored red sauce.  It tasted strong of smoke with a little heat to it.  The table side guacomole was not very tasty and even though we ordered it with everything included, it didnt seem to help.  The tacos were wrapped in an oily shell and the meat was barely seasoned.  When I ate them the oil from the shell coated my tounge and sapped  flavor from the rest of the dish.  There should have been a acid to combat the oiliness, a fresh salsa would have worked well. The restaurant had 4 separate familys with kids and two were extremely loud and obnoxious with the parents ignoring their precious offspring so the whole restaurant could endure the piercing screams of the  children.  This is no fault of the restaurant, however I have to ask, when did it become  acceptable to not take the kids outside when they act up?  Why do some people think it's ok to subject others to their poor or nonexistent parenting choices?"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. First of all, the view was fantastic. The restaurant was not very packed when we decided to stroll in for dinner around 10pm on a Saturday night. It actually felt nice going somewhere more mellow on a weekend night where you can indulge in good food, drinks and conversation. I ordered the burrito \"El Burro Bionico\" which turned out to be the size of an infant. For $11.95 I could have easily shared it with my boyfriend and both been stuffed. I also ordered one of their speciality margaritas with dinner which also turned out to be a hit. The service was attentive and to the point. As our dinner was winding down our waiter let us know about their happy hour that starts at 11pm. We decided to move over to the bar and get a blue margarita. The bartender was friendly and made good drinks. We stayed until about 1am just enjoying some drinks, conversation and amazing view. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The food is good. Staff is nice. Just a little surprised a Michelob is $3.50 but a michelada (Michelob w a glass on the side half filled w Clamato) was $6.50"}
{"text":"This is a nice Mexican restaurant. The view of the strip is pleasant, it's very open and there's a lot of seating available. Our server was very attentive and was very consistently asking if we were alright.  The food was delicious. I got carne asada tacos and the meat was very flavorful and juicy. I got the order of three and I wasn't able to finish because it felt like there was a half a pound of meat in each taco.  It's a bit pricier than most Mexican joints but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"The food was delicious!! We had the Carne asada plate and shrimp chilled rellenos. The Chile was a little under cooked for my liking. We also had menudo which was good. Hand made tortillas are a must. I love that they give you beans with salsa with your chips. But be careful you might get full with them. A definite must next time we're in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Blah. Bland. Really bland. Did I say bland? I had the 3 Tacos de Pescado and there wasn't an ounce of seasoning on the fish. The cabbage had no vinegar or marinating going on. Thankfully they give it to you with a sauce and some fresh lemon wedges, which you must drudge it in make it edible. So stinking elementary, I've had better fish tacos at Rubios. Sad.  My friend sent her chicken back, said it was rock hard and dry since it was so over cooked.   Service was barely there. And although the views are breathtaking, anyone at our table of 6 would jump a mile when they came out to celebrate a birthday. Bring your earplugs, but leave your tastebuds at home. They won't be used for anything here. Such a letdown."}
{"text":"I've eaten at two of the locations in Vegas.  We loved the views from the Henderson location however."}
{"text":"This place is great! It has become a must while visiting Vegas.  I have taken several clients there and they love it.  The carne asada was amazing as well as the fish dishes."}
{"text":"Best restaurant, food and service in Las Vegas! We went for lunch and enjoyed it so much that we went back for dinner. The selection of cocktails, appetizers, and entrees is exceptional along with the service from ALL the waitstaff. My favorite part was the \"company\" cars that give you a complimentary ride back to your hotel on the strip. Great restaurant and definitely will be going back next time I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Took the family here and we were totally floored at how beautiful and festive the surroundings were! Every room is an event!   We got a fabulous booth by the homemade tortilla station and were immediately brought yummy chips, bean dip and (spicy!) salsa. We were also brought cups of soup - a totally unexpected treat that our kids devoured!   Kid review:  We ordered the kids some homemade tortillas (which they did NOT share with us) and the kids menu chicken-which were like thin filets fried, yet like roasted chicken-they LOVED it! Their lemonade apparently were a HUGE hit, as well! This is now our kids number 1 favorite restaurant of all!!! I wished I'd written down all the compliments they kept blurting out throughout their meals!   Adult review:  My husband and I couldn't resist splitting two entrees- enchiladas-one Mole sauce and one Green sauce (starts with an \"A\") with diced onions on top-yum!!! I must say that I don't usually like rice but the serving size was so cute and small it made the \"dish\" as a whole, very appealing!   And ...omg...the coconut Margarita (blended!) with fresh grated coconut sprinkled on top.....yuuuuuuuuuuuum!!!!!!   Husband's highlights: Blue Cadillac Margarita tasted crisp and strong and the chip in the entree was like a sinfully delicious chimichanga!"}
{"text":"Good good, service is a bit slow.  Environment is fun and good copy of Mexican culture ..  had the enchiladas with green pepper ! Delish!"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food! Went to Lindo Michoacan on a trip to Las Vegas last week. Started with guacamole, then got the Al Pastor taco plate. Delicious and authentic, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good Mexican food in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, not bad, but definitely not great. Lacks attentive and knowledgeable service. Server lacked short term memory. Our table had to ask several times for same item."}
{"text":"What the actual F? Beautiful evening, out door patio, all signs point to awesome. We ordered bacon wrapped shrimp, combination platter, carnitas, carne asada tacos. Carnitas was cooked perfect, crispy, beautiful but under seasoned. Ugh. Chips, clearly from a bag, bean dip very bland and plain, salsa (if you can call it that) canned. My shrimp arrived to the table with a smell, clearly needed to be cooked the day before, the mayo they served on the side did not, could not, save it. It's no wonder they push (the delicious) margaritas...hard no for next time."}
{"text":"Excellent service !!!! Food is great !!! Love that they give you chips salsa and even beans !!! Then comes a little bowl of Fideo!!!!!!!! Always I must when going to Las Vegas !!! They always keep on checking on you !!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Great atmosphere and service was fantastic. The food was like how abuelita used to make it!"}
{"text":"The food here is good, they have a large menu with a lot to choose from. I was only here once on a Friday night as part of a larger party. We had to wait a long time to be seated despite having a reservation in advance. The parking situation isn't the best if you come at prime dinnertime. You'll end up having to park across the street (there are No Parking signs on the same side as Lindo that no one seemed to observe). Really nice view of town though!"}
{"text":"Such a great place to dine! I took a client here after closing escrow and it was the perfect place to celebrate! Fast service, great food and authentic environment!"}
{"text":"The resturant itself was packed, very busy. It seemed like a lot of people liked it, but that was just not the case for me and my family. I ordered something that I get a lot of times at Mexican resturants, and it was very disappointing. I felt sick for the rest of the night after eating and left a lot of expensive food to waste. The service was great untill the end of the night. It seemed like no one was around to bring us our bill. It seemed like a quality eating establishment, but my 1 experience there just wasn't good at all. I wouldn't come back to Lindo Michoacan..."}
{"text":"Nice place,good service prices are high for what you get,food is ok,high class taco joint,"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. It's true what most reviews are trying to get across: this place is authentic. It doesn't feel cheap like most Mexican restaurants and you can actually sit down and have a meal here. There is a band that plays throughout the restaurant and employee attire fits the theme well.   The food was delicious. To add to the authenticity, my husband was really excited when we were given sopa de Fideo before our meal. He's not Mexican himself, but his closest friends are and he has fond memories of their mothers making it. The portions are huge and the menu is pretty extensive and there are a few unique dishes that I haven't seen elsewhere. I had the caldo de res and the meat was so juicy and tender: it fell right off the bone. My husband was happy with his fish meal. You also get complimentary chips with salsa and bean dip. The bean dip is to die for. I want a can of it to bring home!  I only have a couple of complaints though. First, this place can get really busy! The wait time can be a little long, but the employees work fast to get tables cleaned and to get you seated. Secondly, since there is a band in the restaurant and it always seems to be packed, it can get very loud in here. If you come with a date, good luck trying to hear them. Might want to consider that if you're thinking to have a quiet date. Lastly, I understand that it's busy, but the service wasn't that great. And because of the noise, I had to ask our host to repeat himself several times because I couldn't hear.   Despite the few minor bad things that I experienced at Lindo Michoacan, I had a fun time. I definitely want to come back again."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic amazing Mexican food...this is not the place! LOL  Amazing views and drinks that they offer however were right up my alley.  We started with the tequila sampler and margarita, dinner-  I had the enchiladas they were average and bland.  I can't remember what BFF had however you can see in the pictures below that it doesn't look like \"fine dining\"."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant. I've been to the one in Henderson, on Carnegie several times but disappointed the last several times. A friend recommended coming to the original Lindo Michoac√°n here on Desert Inn. My daughter and I came this evening and were not disappointed!  Great service, very personable staff and food was sensational. We had cocktails and their famous beans to dip chips into. We ordered the shrimp tacos and they were the best!!  We were so full we couldn't eat desert. We both said we're coming here from now on. Just when we were finishing, live music came on. Very nice!!  I found home!!"}
{"text":"Wow lets talk about poor service. So the reviews looked pretty positive so a friend and I went here on vDay (today) we called to put our name on the list for 8, got there at 7.30, got seated at 9.20, only because we saw the girl who first wrote down our name.  It kind of got to be a game, each person would ask where they were on the list and all the girl would say is 'yah, just a few' or 'just a little bit' without even finding their names. Not a place that is used to packed crowds.  Now lets talk about the veggie burrito I got which was just filled with zucchini, 3 small pieces of onion and two slivers of carrots. No, doesn't pass for anything.   No beans or cheese, or anything fun like that in it. Oh well, lesson learned. You guys can keep this one for yourself. Wont be going back."}
{"text":"3.5 We decided to have dinner here on a Sunday night with a couple of friends. To say this place was busy would be understatement of the century. Luckily, there is a huge parking lot behind the restaurant itself. The restaurant is actually a lot bigger on the inside than it appears to be from the outside. It appears that this is the spot for celebrating birthdays because once inside, it was nothing but large parties. One con with that is the annoying mariachi band birthday song every 10 minutes. The staff is friendly even among all of the chaos. It may have just been that particular night, but surrounded by a huge crowd, just sitting in the waiting area was making me feel like I was going to have an anxiety attack.  We were finally seated and presented with chips along with bean and salsa dips. The chips were fresh and both of the dips were fine. I opted for the carnitas while my husband went with the steak ranchero. My carnitas were cooked well, but had it not been for the additional sauce they would have majorly lacked any flavor. My husband's steak ranchero was just that...a piece of mediocre meat smothered in melted cheese. I would say in comparison to a place like the Red Iguana in SLC, this place falls way short in therms of \"best\" Mexican food.  The prices are decently reasonable relative to the portions, but not necessarily to the quality of the food. With that being said, I'd say it is still one of the better sit down Mexican food option in Vegas."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  The table side guacamole and the playa azul are my favorites. The dishes are always consistent and of high quality."}
{"text":"My sister wedding reception was here. What a great place and I enjoyed it. Table side gacu was good. The salsa was okay. Thank you"}
{"text":"At the end of our dinner we were really disappointed, looks like we are not going back. Really expensive for poor Mexican food. I rather go to Javier's and spend my money for good quality Mexican food. Only chip and Salsa were good. I paid almost $20 for Birria that had little bit of meat and lots of soup. Soup tasted old not fresh. You can get better quality Birria for less money at Pepe's Tacos and Roberto's Tacos. The only reason I will go back is for the chips, salsa and guacamole and service."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food! Seriously a must in Las Vegas! I must have been to vegas 20 times before realizing there was great Mexican food in the desert! Authentic and the service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is not my first time... Nor will it be my last. This food hits the spot after a night of partying in Vegas. Every time we're out here we make it a tradition to have breakfast here at least once. The Michelada's they serve are a hangover cure. And the menudo is muy delicioso. All the food Ive tried here has never once disappointed. The atmosphere is very welcoming and the service is fast. They are on top of their game... best sit down Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas in my honest opinion."}
{"text":"I'm not knowledgeable at all about Mexican food. Growing up in Hawaii, I think I could count with one hand the number of Mexican restaurant we had on O'ahu. I definitely have to broaden my experience in what delicious authentic Mexican dishes are supposed to taste like. However, it didn't stop me from enjoying my lunch here.  The staff was very friendly and patient. I asked our bartender what chicken dish she'd recommend for me. She named a few and I ordered the Trece (Pollo al Mojo de Ajo) and my boyfriend ordered Veintidos (Tacos de Camaron). Their lunch specials are definitely a good deal, ranging from $8.50 to $11.50, including a beverage, refill, rice beans, and tortillas. Our chips, salsa, and bean dip arrived immediately, and now I can see why people loved the salsa. I loved their flour tortillas, too.  We're wanting to come back for Cinco de Mayo, but wondering if we can brave the crowd, I'm sure it'll be packed. I almost forgot to say what an amazing view the restaurant had!   I'd definitely come back for their food and service, it was great. Next time, I'll order dessert...fried ice cream....yum."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and ambiance.  I loved it. We had a very attentive server along with an attentive busboy who was always there if we needed refills or more chips and salsa (and beans, whoa!)  My mom and I shared the chicken fajitas, and it was delicious. Their guacamole is GREAT, and so are their handmade tortillas (even the corn ones are handmade!)   The ambiance is great too, it reminds me of Casa Guadalajara in San Diego a little bit.  I would come back the next time I visit Vegas in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Excellent margaritas and freshly made authentic tortillas. Long time Las Vegas staple that doesn't disappoint time and time again."}
{"text":"Saw this place was Yelp's #1 Mexican Restaurant in Las Vegas, and headed over to try it out.    8 PM on a Saturday and we could see the place was packed as we walked past the windows - started wondering whether we should have made a reservation.  However, they were able to seat us immediately, which was nice.    The interior is quite large, and subdivided into about 3 or 4 different rooms.  There is smoking in a small bar area that has a few video poker machines, but the smoke doesn't travel beyond it very far.  The walls and ceiling are festooned with various pots, artwork, and miscellaneous Mexicana; it is like a Mexican T.G.I. Friday's.    Service was speedy, accurate, friendly, and didn't miss a beat.  We started with the guacamole dip, which is hand-made to-order in front of your table.  GF thought there was too much cilantro flavor, but I liked it.  Food portions were generous (neither of us was able to finish our meals), though I wish there had been a little more zing to it.  It was good, without being great, if you follow me.  Anyway, our experience was a happy one, and if the food hadn't been missing that certain \"something,\" it would have been 5 stars.  Maybe next visit."}
{"text":"Lindo has great food, a fun atmosphere, and an amazing view of the strip! There menu has a lot of different options compared to most mexican restaurants and they are all reasonably priced. It's usually pretty busy so plan on waiting, but it will be worth your time. This is another place I would take my family and friends to when they come to visit"}
{"text":"Literally THE best Mexican food I have ever had. From the minute you walk up you are greeted by friendly and smiling staff. The place smells so clean and the decor is colorful, authentic, and beautiful. The meal starts with complimentary chips, salsa, and beans. The beans are delicious and easy to get full on before your meal...but wait !! There's more !! They also give you complimentary sopa de fideo to begin your meal before your food even comes out. We were borderline stuffed BEFORE our food came out. We ordered enchiladas, tacos, huevos rancheros, and the ensalada marinero which was absolutely loaded with shrimp and avocado and the most delicious flavors and extra fresh !! So glad we found this place suggested by friends I encourage you to give it a try. Prices are reasonable and portions are HUGE !!!"}
{"text":"Most amazing Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, I always get the grilled shrimp tacos. ALWAYS! Lol"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and never walked away thinking \"wow, that was so amazing I'm never going to eat again.\"  Which is what I pretty much expect.  Ever.  The service was exceptional, the food was decent, but I'm just a wee bit concerned when I read all the dishes has some exceptional spices and \"mom's secret spices\" and then seemed....blah.  I ordered carnitas fajitas.  The pork was SUPER soft and melted in my mouth but I couldn't taste any of those secret spices or whatever that's supposed to be in the dish.  I thought onions and bell peppers were supposed to give flavor to the meat?  Whatever, I still ate it.  What's cool is they gave me two HUGE flour tortillas that were freshly made.    We even ordered guacamole that is prepared fresh at your table...and it wasn't amazing.  It was good, just not amazing.    I'll go back because it WAS a good experience, just don't expect 100% authentic mexican food :)  Not like I know what that is anyway....."}
{"text":"Nice mexican place with a very extensive menu.  Had a combo with beef tamale, taco and a burrito which was pretty good but not awesome.   The fideo soup was very very salty and the complimentary tortilla chips a bit too greasy.  Service was very attentive and friendly and we enjoyed the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Wow! Haven't been to the original in years, but everything was amazing! Service was fast, friendly, and unobtrusive! Food was awesome! Even the kids loved it! If you haven't been here in a while, come back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is outstanding.  My wife and I stop by for happy hour often. Their food is outstanding, I have pretty much loved everything I've eaten off their menu. You have to try their fresh guacamole that they make table side and try their habernero salsa if you like it HOT. Drinks are delicious and reasonably priced and they have a great tequila selection. Also, the staff and bartenders are friendly and great at what they do. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is good, but it's not the original. This place is in a nicer neighborhood and a nice building with a cool view of the strip. However it is about 70% of what the Original Lindo is. This place constantly serves my wife cold chicken tacos. They should be piping hot when they come out, which they are at OG Lindo, but not here. The service is a tad bit slower here too. The main dinner entrees are still delicious though."}
{"text":"This place is the reason I moved to Vegas. The service and every menu items I've had since coming here for the first time 12 years ago has amazed me every time. This place has what every restaurant is missing, the enthusiasm, initiative, and the attention to detail goes beyond the call of duty. Only complaint I have is the trumpet player, it's really really loud when it's 4 feet away from your head."}
{"text":"What a great find. Happy vibe full of locals celebrating life. Extensive menu and tequila offerings. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Found this Gem on yelp & could hardly wait to eat after drinking all night. We walk in & were greeted by EVERYONE. Which is sets a good vibe. We sat down & were immediately served Chips, Salsa & Refried Beans. The waiters are all men (more traditional in Mexican restaurant service in my opinion and sets a more professional visual) anyway, each of them were efficient & diligent in cleaning up tables, refilling waters, supplying napkins, basically in any & all assistance. However, & I also personally like this, the manager or one of them took our order himself, delivered our drinks, served us some kind of soup (we didn't order, it's complimentary) & then brought my BF a second serving. The manager himself then served us our food & when my BF asked if he could have some extra carrots in his soup he smiled happily & genuinely then brought a bowl filled with broth & carrots to our table. We were EXTREMELY PLEASED at this point. Our drinks were refilled, our chips were refilled & salsa too throughout our eating experience. You definitely don't feel like they are struggling to not waste food, they were very generous that way. The manager came & checked up on us at least twice, not too invasive either. It was all I could do to not tell him how wonderful everything was over & over - because it really was!! The food was spectacular. I ordered Shrimp fajitas & you can't really mess that up, except if you don't clean your shrimp - ew! My shrimp were cleaned & Deviened they way they should be, I was so happy!! Both my BF & I received tortillas of our choice with our meals & we both orders flour. These tortillas were SO FRESH, there was literally light leftover flour on my hands!!!!! They were soft, so soft & warm, perfectly prepared! I'm not a total snob trust me, I do not expect perfection however that is exactly what kind of service this place distributes to their guests - PERFECTION!! The entire restaurant was clean, tidy & continually being cleaned as well. When we were done with our food we said goodbye to everyone again, shook the managers hand, then I personally thanked him for a beyond wonderful dining experience. I told him I would be back again. Hey when your on vacation (who isn't on vacation minutes away from the strip, everyone is) you want to have a good time, especially if your on vacation with your man or woman. This place increased the fun & satisfaction of our trip!! Thank you again!!!!! WE WILL BE BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for my friend's birthday and this was my second time coming here. I got the fish tacos and guacamole. My bf got a pork carnitas burrito and we both loved what we got. Everyone else we were with loved their dishes as well. The food is flavorful and tasty. We also loved their drinks. I was surprised at how good my tacos were especially because fish tacos are usually a hit or miss. My tacos were fresh and the flavors were delicious. I would definitely come back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place! Never have had a bad experience.  Been doing take out lately since it's always so busy and don't like waiting. Only suggestion to the business to is to designate a pick up parking spot as it is already so hard to find parking there."}
{"text":"Great flavors, really authentic taste. It was voted Best of Las Vegas 2015 for a reason."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I did not review this place years ago when I first came here but I will now!  About 4 years ago I was in Vegas for a convention and my cousin took me to Lindo Michoacan for dinner one night and I was blown away.  It is the type of Mexican food that makes you want to sit at the restaurant for three hours just to not be full so you can start eating again.    My wife and I were recently in vegas for the NASCAR race and when we met up with my cousin again we did have plans to go to a nice steakhouse but nope....we changed those to get some of the best Mexican food I have ever had...again.  My wife could believe the size of the burrito she ordered and everything....everything was just as good as it was 4 years ago.   Big time props to Lindo Michoacan and next time I am in Vegas you will see me again."}
{"text":"This place has the best customer service I have ever experienced. I have been here several time, and the day after New Years I brought my sister to experience this place for herself. She was very amazed with the attentiveness of the waiter. As soon as we got there we received our chips, salsa and beans. All the food keeps getting refilled at half full, the menu is very good. We had four different plates ordered and all of them were delicious. Even though this place is not on the strip it is worth the extra miles to get good authentic Mexican food. Guacamole is made on the spot with all fresh ingredients, the staff makes you feel at home they are super friendly and make you feel at home. Service is fast. Free refills on traditional Mexican drinks (nonalcoholic, of course).  All these things keep us coming back. The flan does have a strong rum flavor and is too sweet for our taste."}
{"text":"Very good, real Mexican. Margarita was also awesome. If you want good Mexican food in Vegas, STAY OFF THE STRIP, and find this place.   Great food, nicely decorated, authentic Mex. Yum."}
{"text":"We came here for the great night view of the city, it was amazing! The restaurant was clean and inviting. Salsa was very spicy but delicious! They have a huge menu with a ton of unique options so we all opted for things out of the ordinary. Buey cilantro was very good and my friends enjoyed the steak with coco cola sauce. If you're in the mood for mexican food definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been going here for about 2 years now. The last two times here the service and food have gone downhill. Great location and view is awesome. I guess they are leaning on that for your dining experience. I ordered the fajitas last visit and this time I tried the enchiladas, fajitas had no flavor and the enchiladas tasted like the microwave variety. Sorry to see this place go downhill. Hope they fix the problems. Also it's extremely noisy with the band playing. I figured the band was on the weekend but it seems every night. Maybe if they got rid of the band and concentrated back on the food I would go back! No offense nobody wants trumpets blowing off in their ears when you are trying to eat!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out despite the low reviews, and I have to say everyone is pretty much right about the atmosphere and the food. The place is located in an amazing area on top of a hill and has an amazing view. The service was great, it was extremely busy and we were sat within two minutes, despite having to park on the street because there was absolutely no parking. They have a great selection of food. We tried the queso as an appetizer, and a combination of fish and beef tacos as the main course. The food was just not that good! I enjoyed the atmosphere and the view, but I've had better Mexican food at tiny taco shacks in town, and I eat A LOT of Mexican food. The quality and flavor was just not there. Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"We came here with a big party on a Saturday night at 6:30. There must have been 20+ people waiting for a table. Good news for us is that they honored the reservation and sat us in the back room immediately. Our server and busboy did an excellent job considering the size of the group. I ordered the Camerones Purepecha, a shrimp casserole dish that came with rice and beans on the side. The shrimp dish was OK but not great. The rice and beans were typical chain Mexican restaurant fare. With good food and good service, the reason for only the 3 star rating is the ambiance. The noise level made it very hard to hear the person sitting across from you. About every 15 or 20 minutes, a mariachi band came by to play happy birthday to one of the nearby tables. The first 2 or 3 times it was cute. After that, it just added to the noise. I know some folks like that kind of vibe in a restaurant. But not for me. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Got a chicken chimichanga and it was literally just chicken nothing else... chicken super dry absolutely awful"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican resturant in Henderson. The service is always great, food is appetizing and the margarita selection is goooooooood.   My favorite server is Effrian! He's amazing. Very polite, professional and helpful. I always order the chicken con rajas y crem√©. It's my favorite dish! The el pastor is really good here as well.   The chips are delicious, with the beans and salsa. Be carful not to indulge on these...you won't be able to finish you're meal.   This is also great place to celebrate birthdays, as the band comes out and sings!!"}
{"text":"I had to stop by this place before a show and honestly, it wasn't worth it esp. considering the distance between the strip and this place. I ordered for a take out and they were so rude about it. I wanted deep fried ice cream because it is the most delicious dessert, and it sucked. Hands down, the ice cream sucked. And the ice cream cost $6. So sad..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in he US. I go every time I'm in Las Vegas. The fried cheese is to die for and the Margaritas are really good. I've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"The service is very friendly. The restaurant is really large but every time I come here it's fairly empty. I don't enjoy this place. My husband loves this chicken plate they have. I really hate their Fideo. It's so salty. I can't stand it. Fideo should be the easiest thing to get right. I do really like the refried beans. I normally have the Chile relleno. It's okay. Nothing I absolutely love but it's eatable, so I eat it when my husband forces me to come here. I don't praise this place to much. Their tortillas aren't great and neither is their salsa. Two of the things that make Mexican Food stand out. Their rice is okay. Pretty much everything I've tried here is just okay. Their food reminds me of Roberto's, to me they are very similar. Except the price is more and that's okay only because the service is always good."}
{"text":"it's bomb. it's the go to place while here on biz. muchas gracias!  food is great and the margaritas are wonderful. i might challenge the bar tender!  tableside guacamole is very good and after watching, you swear you could do it at home. go ahead and try.  my 6th time here. what does that tell you???"}
{"text":"Being from Texas its hard finding good Mexican food,they come pretty close to good Tex-mex.Bartenders are great and accommodating. Slots are ok never really won there,but the margaritas make up for it."}
{"text":"This is probably not the best location for the quality of food that I've come to expect from this chain. I had ordered a Mexican style steak with their spiciest chilli sauce.  This sauce is supposed to be the spiciest sauce they make. The heat kick from this sauce is pretty intense, especially on the next day. The steak I had ordered was medium-rare. The quality of the meat was pretty good and it was cooked perfectly. You do loose the flavors from the juices of the meat due to the heat, but it was a Mexican place and I had low expectations for the steak.  We ordered a table side guacamole, which was made fresh in front of us. The drinks were good, I would recommend trying their mango margaritas."}
{"text":"Lindo's has several locations but the one located on E. Desert Inn is superior to the other branches.    I am guilty of ordering the same thing everytime I am there which is probably at least once a month.  Their food is always consistent.  I give them kudos for making the best guacamole tableside!  The avocado is always fresh.  My lunchtime favorite is the Camarones de Sarandeado.  The portion is just right and the sauce is what completes the whole meal!"}
{"text":"We love Lindo Michoacan! We, usually, go to the one right next to our house (on W. Flamingo), but we travel to this one whenever we have company in town because of the beautiful view of the strip. We've been lucky enough that each visit we've been seated next to the windows to enjoy the view.  The complimentary salsa, refried beans, and tortilla chips are quite filling... so, take it easy to ensure you have room for your actual meal. The beans are sometimes bland, but nothing a little salt can't fix. Besides, this isn't the main reason we come here.  With every meal, we've gotten a cup of their fideo soup (which kind of reminds us of those Lipton Cup a Soup packets). No matter, it's still yummy!  My go to dish is their Pollo con Rajas y Crema (pounded chicken breasts with onions and pasilla chilies in a cream sauce) served with rice and refried beans. So delicious! Every Lindo location I've visited, the dish has tasted the same... so, that makes me happy! My bf likes to have something different each time, so he's tasted everything from their Filet Relleno to the Chile Verde to their selection of Lengua.  We've not been disappointed by any of our selections and will continue to visit this and other Lindo Michoacan locations."}
{"text":"I will never come back here!! Javier you need to train your servers and management!!! Your manager came over and said hello Guys we where four women...said her server asked us... we all said no flour!!!! Than to top it off the server never came back to the table to ask if we wanted more drinks???   Every  time we come here we say no flour they give us flour!!!"}
{"text":"First, the service was ridiculously super. I barely started drinking my soda and the waiter was there asking if I would need a refill. The food also came out super fast.  Second, the bean dip offered for the chips and dip when you first arrive was excellent and it seemed to stay hot until the meal was brought out.  My only complaint was that the cheese enchillada at Roberto's has more flavor than this cheese enchillada.  The portions were huge and the rest was great."}
{"text":"If you can score a table by the window at sunset or night time, you are in for a beautiful view! The food is pretty good, a few hits and misses, but all in all, it's pretty good. It does get super crowded, so make a reservation and be prepared for a parking nightmare! You will see cars lined up and down the steep streer it sits on. Oh, if you come for your birthday they give u a free tequila shot and the BEST churros!"}
{"text":"Ehhh. I've had better mexican food at a tex-mex chain in the bay area. The chille relleno was bland, the tamales were dry and bland, and the carne asada taco i had tasted a little off. It was as if the carne asada was prepared hours before, and then put in a microwave to heat when i ordered it. The chips/salsa/beans they gave was pretty good though.   A group of about 7 of us went to this place around 12p on friday and the service was less than stellar. Our waiter was kind of a moron, and he didn't seem to understand how to split checks, or write down our orders correctly. I'll stick to robertos/faustos/amigos/etc. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is not Mexican food, is texmex food which is a lot of difference, my Server: Carlos was horrible, he was talking with the rest of employees while we're was waiting for him to order the food, we will never come back to that Restaurant again."}
{"text":"Meh. I don't get the big deal. How is this on the Best of Vegas list? Gourmet Mexican Cuisine? If my meal had cost $3, I probably wouldn't be mad that the food had no flavor. The service was very good, but the food isn't good enough to go back for. Now I have to drive to Leticia's or Viva Mercado tomorrow to get some real Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food was awesome the service was horrible.  Literally took over 30 mins after we were done eating to get a to go box and our check!  Disappointing :("}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Las Vegas.  I used to eat at their original restaurant on Desert Inn, and this location is just as good.  Freshly made, crispy tortillas are great."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Great portions, great food and great atmosphere. Would be a 5 but service was sadly lacking. I'm unsure if this was common or because they were serving very large parties but I'll find out and revise this score based on the next time I go."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is just incredibly tasty. I wish I could eat here every day but is not that cheap. It is not expensive either. You get what you pay for and this place gives you the best plates for fair prices. I recommend everyone to try Lindo Michoacan if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing view first of all great atmosphere..I got the shrimp fajitas with all the trimmings and my bf got the steak with bacon on top of it ....everything was good...they bring you chips bean dip an salsa in the beginning which is a nice touch ...we will be returning"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Mexican Food and saw this restaurant had good reviews so thought we'd try it while staying in Las Vegas.  It was a little drive for us but worth it...the food was great as was the service...we've been back twice!  We also love their restaurant on Desert In in Las Vegas....will definitely recommend to our friends when they visit Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Live music tonight!  Met up with Loren F. to eat a bite of dinner before going over to Tivoli.    There was a singer singing some Latino favorites which I recognize the music but don't speak Spanish.  It was nice to have some entertainment.  It was all I could do to not get up and dance.  The chips, refried beans and salsa help prep you for the amazing food to come.  I just had two grilled fish tacos since I ate so many chips.  It was all I needed for a small meal.  The grilled fish was seasoned with the Baja seasoning, served with avocado and cabbage.    Since Loren F. speaks Spanish, we got instant rapport with Oscar, our waiter.  He was very attentive to us and we had everything we needed.  It's not necessary to speak Spanish there as I have been many times and always had a wonderful experience.  Lindo Michoacan is my all around favorite Mexican restaurant.  Everything on the menu is fresh and perfectly seasoned.  Can't wait til my next visit."}
{"text":"This is the real deal Mexican Food. Someone compared it to TexMex? I havent had anything this authenticate since I was in Mexico. Dont go to a Mexican restaurant and expect them to serve Americanized mexican food.  Go to Chipolte for that. The atmosphere was wonderful. FULL of mexican decorations and not just the common maracas. Place was quiet, and the view fantastic. Tables were NOT back to back. Plenty of room to walk around if you wanted. Also, as you come in the front door, you can see the kitchen and watch them cook through the glass. They have a large bar which I plan on going back to try very soon. Service was great until after we got our check. Took server 10 minutes to come grab our card so we could pay. But other then that, he was there checking in on us every 5-10 minutes. Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"Confused about all the great reviews. Pros: Great atmosphere Friendly service  Food was good quality.  Cons: Why does it smell like musty old towels that have been soaking in water? (got used to that smell. Most prominent in the bar area u less it was the large group that was being musky) Food was very lacking of flavor and salt. Maybe they were thrown off by having such a large group to serve? Went last Saturday night. Aside from zero flavor, quality was good..."}
{"text":"I have ate at Lindo Michoac√°n several times at both locations . They are both great I do prefer the desert inn location. The food is always delicious and the service matches . We have two young kids and they definitely cater to them they bring them soup within a few minutes of seating us . I have order a wide variety of things there and have never left disappointed ."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Had a very special affair, made a reservation at 7 pm. We were finally take back at 7:45. The girls behind the counter were very rude. They brought the manager and we explained to her that we had a reservation, she told us that they were cleaning tables for us. Very disappointed, was a very special day, I did everything on my end to prepare and they dropped the ball. The young girls behind the counter were extremely rude, rude enough to repeat myself. I will never go back and let my friends and family know about our experience. I emailed them asking for the owner just to make him aware. Manager emailed me back and I told them I wanted to talk to Javier, the owner, still waiting. I waited long enough, This is my review."}
{"text":"Originally, I was hesitant about going to eat here but I was so wrong. This place is amazing.  The staff was extremely friendly and the food was delicious.  They start you off with Chips, Salsa, and Bean Dip.  All three are very good.  Most of the menu items are around 20 bucks except for the Combinations page (gold mine).  The Combinations are delicious and huge. We had some deep fried ice cream, and it was the best deep fried ice cream I have eaten.  Their was a birthday in our party and they sang, gave us complementary churros, and a shot of tequila.   Although this place was off the strip, I will definitely try to visit when I'm in town."}
{"text":"We ate here three times and brought friends twice and every time we enjoyed our meal and service. This is our go to Mexican Restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to give it another go and found some dishes that are a lot better. We love the fish and carne asada tacos! It's pretty awesome that they give you complimentary refried beans in addition to salsa and the fideo soup is also very good."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas, tired of the boring junk on the strip, I was checking Yelp from my phone, found a few reviews.  The reviews of Lindo were good (especially the recent ones) so I suggested it and the whole family drove over.  From the moment we sat down our group (6 people) we were totally taken care of.  The service was amazingly fast, (food too) the menu was like 6 huge pages of great dishes.  Everyone in the party got something different and everyone was raving after we walked out.  The manager stopped by once or twice to check on us as well as numerous staff.  I can't thank my fellow Yelpers enough; this has to have been the best YELP find ever - however I have found a lot of really good places.  If you are in Vegas for any reason you owe it to yourself to try this place, I was 100% satisfied and I bet you will be as well."}
{"text":"They made my birthday really special : ) I split the fajitas with my husband and they were delicious and filling. Make sure you get the guac. They will make it right in front of you! So fresh. I really enjoyed the service, too!"}
{"text":"Tortillas made to order, fresh, and by hand.  Chicharrones are smothered in an unbelievable mole sauce, you'll need lots of tortillas to sop it all up. Their quesadillas are made with their homemade tortillas and are dripping with cheese, served with guacamole and sour cream, probably the best I've ever had.  Their bar overlooks the entire valley. Go at night to enjoy the City lights below."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant to go here in Las Vegas. The food is always fresh hot and excellent. The servers are friendly and they have a kids menu to cater to the kids. Good vibes good Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Very Good Food. Excellent Service.  Fresh Guacamole at the table.  Chips and salsa good.  Portion size huge.  FRESH MADE TORTILLAS. friendly staff."}
{"text":"Sadly food just OK - Nice service & view. We were hoping for greatness based on some internet reviews - But our experience was very underwhelming with a  good view.  There is way better Mexican food to be had at other restaurants  here in Las Vegas.  Our beef fajitas were not sizzling (not even hot)  and flavor just OK -- and our friend's ordered shrimp fajitas which hardly had any shrimp  Seriously, it was chintzy.  Flaming Fajitas on Tropicana really does it right. Our orders here were very ordinary.   We wanted to really love it -- but our food experience was very so-so. Got tableside guacamole -- and it was fun to watch, just OK.flavor.  Best guacamole we've had in town found at El Sombrero Mexican Bistro (not made tableside but excellent )."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were great. Awesome view of las vegas also. Margaritas were alittle over priced in my opinion. It gets packed so I would recommend a  reservation."}
{"text":"Winner of The Starbucks Syndrome Award. What is this award? Well everyone knows that Starbucks serves the worst coffee on planet earth and charge outrageous prices for same yet they continue to pack customers in for no other reason than the coolness factor and name recognition.  The same goes for this restaurant. It's in a well-to-do area without a lot of eating establishments and the people go because it's convenient and they can afford to throw their money away.   Hence, if you are looking for a loud, noisy, place with mediocre food that costs as much or more than eating on the strip, this is your place!   From the worst salsa I have ever eaten in my life to the greasy chips, I told my wife then we should run, not walk out of there. The average plate costs $15-20, which is simply absurd for what you get ....bland food with a lot of breading and little meat at a cost that will allow you to go to much nicer restaurants for a cheaper price.  Simply unbelievable that this place is in business. And, just like Starbucks, it just goes to show that American standards have become increasingly low compared to other places in the world. Hence, we throw away our money and don't hold people/establishments accountable for their actions and, in fact, reward them for ripping us off just as we do our politicians."}
{"text":"We were introduced to this awesome restaurant by family when we visited from out of town. Let me start by saying this place was mega crowded. Luckily my soon to be sis in law knew to call ahead and get our name on the list. We had to park on the Main Street as the whole lot was packed.  Loved the appetizer chips and salsa with warm bean dip too. Oh man! The salsa was spicy but amazing.  Entrees are served with rice and beans as well as a cup of soup. The cup of soup was tomato based with tiny noodles in it. Nothing special to me; but hubs liked it enough to finish his small bowl. But not interested in ours.  I ordered flautas (flour tortilla) and hubs got carne asada tacos. All the food was great. Pretty sure tortillas made on site. Kids liked their food too. Bro and sis got margaritas; they raved about them.  Service was AWESOME. Continually had water refills and Arnold palmer refills as needed. Chips and salsa refilled w/o us asking. Just very attentive and kind. The server was awesome as he chimed in on his recommendations of food w/o being pushy.  Live entertainment was decent too. Guy is the regular I hear. But he played his guitar and sang. They even sang my daughter HB and she got to wear the honorary sombrero. All good.  Prices were ok. $12-16 a plate on average. Not too bad. $95 for 6 people with a few adult drinks on the tab. I'd say this is pretty reasonable.  Last tip: sit by the window! The VIEW at night is fantastic. City lights twinkling with the strip lights from afar."}
{"text":"I never post on Yelp but I had to... I created a yelp account just to say how bad food and service is at this location. I love Lindo and I have never had a bad expirience like I did Yesterday.6/11/2015 I normally go to the one on Centennial hills and I always have great expirience with great cutomer service. Let me begin with the fact that the beans had no taste the soup was cold... and by cold I mean Cold... Their customer service sucked , seemed like they were in a rush or something , they only had like 4 other families . I asked for Fish Ceviche.. ( i know how ceviche is made) This ceviche was disgusting .. I normally dont complain when something tastes bad. But I couldnt eat this . It has a nasty bitter taste .. as if the lemons had gone bad .. when limons arent fresh they get some type of yucky taste , and the limon the fish was marinated in was horrible. When I told the waiter about the taste he said thats how ceviche is made... I told him i know that ceviche is marinated in lemon but the limons are bad. I dont think he understood. He went to speak to the cheff. came back with a \"NEW\" plate and when i tasted it ... it was exactly the same but with more salt. (Guys you need fresh  limons.). I didnt say anything at all . I simply didn't eat it. They didnt apologize , didnt say anything . I  most definitely wont be going to this location Ever. I will stick to the one on Centennial Hills..  The only reason i gave 1 star was because i liked the candy they have in the front."}
{"text":"Been coming here for almost 10 years now! It's my families favorite Mexican food in the Las Vegas area.   The restaurant is very large inside and has some seating that overlooks the strip. It's decorated in Mexican decor and they even have live entertainment sometimes.   It's hilarious when they come to the table for a birthday. They kinda sneak up on the birthday person and throw a sombrero on their head and sing to them with a lit candle inside a churro and a shot of tequila if it's an adult.    The chips, salsa and beans are tasty and always something to look forward to. The enchilada sauce can be somewhat bland sometimes but everything else on the menu is pretty good. The tortillas are homemade and they bring fideo soup when an entree is ordered but they always bring it for kids. Chile relleno is amazing and so are the vegetation tacos. There are so many options on the menu that it never gets old. There are terrific lunch specials on weekdays until 5. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I adore their happy hour! M-f 2-6pm! I haven't had a margarita I didn't like! The food is delish and there's live music after 6! Authentic Mexican food! Only thing is watch out when you're in a group because we've had bill mix ups!"}
{"text":"Average restaurant of Mexican quality decent size portion Margarita was okay atmosphere was pretty good overall and we enjoyed it I wouldn't go out of my way to come back but it was average"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love this place.  I had pscado \"playa azul\" that's the best a white guy can do. The flavor was great but the quality and portion of fish could of been a little better for $20. The staff is great as well and the view is awesome. And thats what I think you're paying for. I live within walking distance so I'm here quite often but just started yelping."}
{"text":"This has such bad service and the food is always wrong in some way. When I went there I asked for carneasita well done and I got a medium rare."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. After leaving Macayo's from horrible service. Lindo hooked us up. Great service the manager came by twice to ask if everything was good. The servers are so nice. The food is amazing. No wonder this place gets the best Mexican food in Vegas year after year."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING service!! The food was excellent...especially the fresh guacamole!!! My boyfriend told our server that it was my birthday. At the end of our delicious meal they placed a humongous sombrero on top of my head and the servers and the mariachi band sung a version of \"happy birthday to you\". Then they brought me a shot of tequila and a few of the best tasting churros I've ever had in my life!! It was such a wonderful experience!! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Overview: This is the perfect place for someone who likes Mexican food, but doesn't really like Mexican food. The food is tastes but it's not amazing. The atmosphere is really fun and great for groups. Plus the city light views at night are awesome.   Chilli relleno: Usually this is my go-to choice when I'm eating Mexican so, being from Tucson I've had many amazing rellenos in my life. The ones at Lindo are just okay. The breading is pretty soggy and the cheese inside the pepper is not always melted and there isn't a lot of cheese to being with.   Guacamole: this is something Lindo does amazingly. I would come here just for the guac. It's the perfect balance of onions, jalape√±os and cilantro. And the avocados they use are always top notch ripe. Not fruity at all. So, so good.   Vegetable Fajitas: this is another one of my favorite dishes. I was surprised when they brought out the vegetables and there were carrots and cauliflower along with the saut√©ed peppers and onions. A little unconventional but they were all still very good. Their tortillas, flour and corn are both super good so you can't go wrong with choosing either of those.   Margaritas: the peach margarita is really delicious. But be warned, all their margaritas are very sweet, and can be strong so you can get yourself into a heap of trouble if you drink then too quickly. Overall, they are worth it. But if you are looking for less sweet and more lime, look somewhere else, or ask specifically for what you want.   Other things that you can look forward to here are the refried beans and salsa they bring out to your table with tortilla chips as an app are super good. I could fill up on chips and beans alone and call it a night.   All in all, if you are looking for Mexican food for a good price, but you want to sit down in a fun restaurant, this is the place for you. But if you are looking for authentic, super high quality, you are better off trying a different spot. Lindo provides, quick, yummy, comfort, Mexican food, good views, a fun environment and relatively strong drinks. So you won't be in awe over your meal but you will leave happy and full."}
{"text":"The food is very good.  Huge selection of favorites and more.  All very fresh and tasty.  The view amazing ( if you're near a window, which we weren't).    The reason for the 3 stars (which is actually VERY generous) is the noise level.  It has been a rare occasion when I've been subjected to this much noise.  The morning after my ears are still ringing.  I liken it to Sitting on the tarmac when a 747 is taking off, or perhaps a Rock Concert where your right next to the speakers.  Get the picture? If you wanted to come here and enjoy a good meal and talk with friends....forget about it.  There's no way you can hear anything you're saying to each other.   Between the natural buzz of a restaurant of patrons, you have a noisy kitchen, someone that clangs a chime every few minutes, a live musician performing your greatest hits over top of of this and then the peace de resistance, Birthday mariachi singers that play literally every 5 minutes.  Here's to Advil!"}
{"text":"Some the best Mexican food I have ever had! After a full day of work, a friend (lives in Vegas) and I decided to hit this place up. We saw a lot of great reviews and heard they were \"best in Vegas\" some 10+ years. I wish 6 stars were available. The shrimp ceviche was fresh and delicious, the cheese enchilada was the best I've had, and the beef dish I ordered was out of this world...then came the FLAN. I have never had flan like this before - it was creamer and tastier than anything I've tried. This is a MUST go restaurant!"}
{"text":"My wife and I keep coming back to this place for three reasons 1- the view, best in Henderson for looking at the entire valley 2- table side guacamole the best we have ever had 3- red sangria and margaritas, just don't let the manager make it, he tends to load it up with ice, and in the end you just get a watered down glass of wine"}
{"text":"This place is super bomb! I'm just pissed that there isn't one in LA. Service, perfect. food, perfect. Drinks, perfect."}
{"text":"Wow! ! ! ! ! !   Amazing dining experience!  Lobster tails were the best, my husband had the chicken enchiladas. He said they were delicious. But what I love the best is the service   when I dine out I liked to be taken care of and that is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"I have frequented this restaurant on several occasions and have always had a great experience. During this occasion however I was deeply disappointed with the service. The evening was off to a good start - our hostess was pleasant and promptly sat us at a great table with a view on the strip. We were greeted by the busser who brought us chips and salsa. Here is where things made a turn for the worse. We sat there waiting for some sort of acknowledgement from our server for more than 10 minutes. After 12 minutes the manager noticed my looks of confusion as I paned the room trying to decipher what the delay might be, as this was what seemed like a particularly slow night here (the slowest I've ever seen). The manager took our drink order and when the drinks were delivered our service decided to make an appearance with no mention of his absence. His opening words were \"are you ready to order?\" I was taken aback, I thought to myself am I at Taco Bell, or a sit down restaurant? After asking him if he would be our server, he responded \"I guess so.\" Every interaction with him we felt as if we were a bother to him, like he could care less about being at work. Our food was delivered by a runner, it wasn't until we were clearly done with our meals that our server asked how our meal was. The icing on the cake was the lack of a birthday celebration for my best friend, as this was my treat in honor of her. I went to the hostess stand at the beginning of the night to ask that they would do the whole desert and singing embarrassing moment for her. It appeared everyone was celebrating a birthday as no joke, we saw 5 other people get their celebratory moments, and the one for my best friend never came (she was probably happy to pass on the embarrassment) It was honestly one of the worst customer service experiences I've had in a long time,  with the plethora of restaurants to chose from, I will not be dining at this place again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is excellent and the food is even better. I love the whole dining experience at Lindo Michoacan. I recommended this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"My family and I love eating here! The food is delicious. I usually order the ceviche or Zamora plate with a pi√±a colada. The guacamole they make at your table is soooo good. My husband brought us all here for my birthday it was a great experience. They keep your cup full and chips and salsa keep on coming. The service here is phenomenal. In my opinion it's one of the best restaurants for Mexican food."}
{"text":"I've always had a good experience at Lindo Michoacan BUT today was a different story. I was there at 2:00pm with my family. We took my mother there for an early Mother's Day dinner. We sat 15 minutes before the waiter, Carlos asked what we were drinking. We finally ordered our food. It took a long time to get our food and it was cold. I'm guessing it must've been up but our waiter didn't bring it out when he should've. There was this party of 8 with kids and they were ordering drink after drinks. The woman was laughing SO LOUD we couldn't hear anything but her!!! All we could hear was that loud laughing hyena. It was so hard to hear my family. Everybody there looked annoyed by the loud noise coming out of her mouth! To make matters worse, our waiter didn't check on us. He was busy singing happy birthday to 3 tables. It was a really bad experience. I will NEVER go back to that location again."}
{"text":"I don't know why I even give them two stars. You are supposed to pay for what you get.! Well, the building and the atmosphere is great. The chicken enchiladas where dry, and warm. I guess the microwave was not working.. The chips are store bought, and salsa only one kind hot. Fideo soup was hot and tasty. Never again even if offered for free. My husbands meal had yellow rice, it smell of perfume? Did they get it from leftovers? A nightmare meal!"}
{"text":"I am giving three stars based on the food. Good/consistent food. Very disappointed that Lindo didn't honor its own unexpired coupon for a free kids meal on Monday night. Not cool. I'll be going elsewhere in the future where coupons and offers are honored."}
{"text":"The best service and authentic Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas hands down. To even give this place four stars is laughable honestly. 5 stars all the way!!!!!! I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"I LOVE ME SOME LINDO. Great atmosphere, yummy food & friendly staff. There is hardly ever a wait for dinner. Wonderful view; if seated toward the back. Sometimes, there is a man that sings live, which is pretty cool. All meals come with chips, salsa, bean dip & fideo soup! It can get loud in the restaurant at times... but that (to me) means everyone is having a good time. Elroy gave excellent service; along with the rest of the staff. They all really do work as a team. Authentic experience, service & food! Viva Lindo!"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I have had a bad experience at this location. The food made me extremely sick for days. The service is okay. The waiter barely came over. We seen more bus boys then anyone else. I wouldn't recommend eating here unless you like being sick from the food."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here this evening, we come on The regular and Can never go wrong with this place- good atmosphere and the severs provide a great experience"}
{"text":"We were craving Mexican food and happened to stumble upon this place. The first thing we noticed was the Amazing view of the valley. You can see the strip perfectly! It was my first time here and they immediately brought us chips and salsa with beans. Yum! Hector was very friendly and Jorge was very knowledgable.   I ordered the Chicken Fajitas and they were spicy, but so good. The flour tortillas they came with taste like they are homemade. I also had the Margarita and it was a pretty good size.   All in all this place was a great experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"Service is great, but honestly the mexican food here is over rated. I came here a year ago, I must have still been drunk and thought the food was great, the next time I came I was sober and did not like the food that much.. They have great service, and make tortillas there.. That was cool.."}
{"text":"Great view. Guacamole was made fresh in front of us, it was good. My husband got pork and it was not fresh and tender at all. I got steak and it was ok. Service was good."}
{"text":"I like this place. Huge menu, great hours, great view, nice staff. The food is not mind blowing but it is tasty! The selection is the best part, if you like Mexican food you will find something you like here. They've got like 5 different dishes with lengua which is awesome. Not a bad beer selection, and the margaritas are pretty good also. All around a great spot, and definitely a place in our standard rotation!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times. the food is typically good but the service just needs work, suggestions coming later...  went there today with a large group, and the place is just over packed. max out no seats. had reservation so that worked out. but there is just to many heads in there. it always feels hot and/or muggy due to that.  ordered the food and drinks, and for some reason the waiter was bringing them like one or 2 at a time, including water. one water had a lemon flavor and water was cloudy, that went back...  food came all at once, and that was on point. the cooks do a great job with the prep of the food at this location. everything was tasting great, so no issues there...  just the service. no refills on water for our group, waited forever to get bill and check out. they are so focused on ringing a bell or doing the happy birthday song 20 times a hour, the service just lacks due to this. honestly, the entire staff doesn't need to clap and scream a happy birthday song. it's just annoying. there can't be 20 birthdays per hour every day, seriously consider cutting back on those. give the candle and free flan and keep it moving. or assign a group of 2 to 3 people with the guitar player to do it. the entire staff in the restaurant shouldn't stop everything to scream a happy birthday song. just a suggestion. also they should stop packing everyone in the restaurant to eat. there is nothing wrong with making customers wait. if they don't want to wait, they can go elsewhere. to put the capacity at max all your doing is sacrificing customer service for earnings, and that will cause people not to come back. most restaurants don't do 100% capacity, the staff can't keep up with it. there isn't even enough room in this location for the capacity they do run. so...STOP filling the place up, think about your staff, waiters and bus boys task. what good is maxing out the space if you can't cater to the customers?  so that is where they lack. just customer service and attentiveness. food quality and taste, perfect.   the view of the city is great, if you can snag a window city view seat, that is something you'll enjoy during your trip for sure.  will go back, but just need to find that sweet time slot when it's not over packed."}
{"text":"Lindo's definitely hit the spot! I was referred to this place by some local friends, and it did not disappoint.  Already have frequented this location multiple times when we go out to Vegas to visit. Soon we will be moving out to Las Vegas, and this will be on the rotation of places to eat at for sure.  The food always taste fresh, hot and lots of flavor. Have had the carne asada dish, tacos, fajitas. All taste excellent. Drinks are good as well. Good selection from bottled beers to drafts.  I don't really have anything negative to say about this restaurant. Every time i have come here it has been excellent.   Staff and service is on point, and friendly. They address our friends by first name since they have been eating there for years and know the family. It is nice."}
{"text":"My wife and decided to have lunch here today. The hostess sat us at our usual window seat as we have been coming here for many years. A young man named Pablo was our server. My wife ordered a simple bean burrito enchilada style  I ordered a relleno stuffed with shrimp for  and our usual guacamole as an appetizer to start. Our whole meal was $44.00  Needless to say her burrito sauce tasted from a can not the normal enchilada sauce. So I flagged a gentleman in a green shirt named Antonio which we assume was the manager as the waiters wore black shirts. He agreed it wasn't enchilada sauce no apology was given to us from him for that.  After over 20 minutes of waiting another waiter brought her a new plate but forgot the side of sour cream she ordered. So he quickly brought a side of sour cream over but was served to us with a knat from the kitchen. I quickly asked for Antonio and showed him the knat in our sour cream. We pointed out to him they were flying along the windows. He didn't apologize at all or at least comp her meal. We were very disappointed the way he handled the situation. Needless to say we will not be eating her no longer. You guys need to work on your customer service!!"}
{"text":"I love this location over all of them due to the food is so much better here and the view here is unbeatable. Also such good service, and amazing alcoholic drinks. Never fails I get cravings just writing this review. Definitely authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Supposedly this place is a big deal. Luckily, on a random weekday, there was no wait. The hostess is dressed in a ... errrrr ... festive fashion (I'm glad my hostessing days are over. And never required a uniform.) The menu is extensive. Seriously, any place that has more than five dishes with lengua is a winner in my book. The wait staff was alert and prompt. The food was delicious and of large enough portions so that I had enough for a second meal (did I mention I love leftovers?).  The best part, though, was the margaritas. Absolutely delicious and come in two sizes. I got the regular size which already looked huge, but then I had two so maybe I could've pulled off the large size. Though I was admittedly quite drunk after my two margaritas; tequila tends to sneak up on me like that.  Their happy birthday is quite festive and involves what appeared to be a mariachi band; I would enjoy bringing someone who is embarrassed by public announcements of their birthday to this place."}
{"text":"It was my mothers birthday and she asked for a place with a mariachis band, she moved here from San Antonio and misses the music. The band was awesome, the service was fantastic, food excellent and the atmosphere was happy, energetic and friendly. We are locals and we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"When we eat Mexican this is where we go. The service is great but the food is amazing. The Camarones Sarandeados Estilos \"Tia Esther\" is the best blend of spice and shimp."}
{"text":"We came here based on all the favorable yelp reviews, the restaurant must have had a bad day because all of our dishes were less than average in terms of taste and quality.  The service was good and the atmosphere pleasant.  The food however just did not have that wow factor but it did have value (lunch menu).  I imagine that dinner there with musical entertainment can be special, their walls have some impressive photos of VIPs."}
{"text":"Oh boy! My boss is taking me and my coworkers out for Mexican food! What could be better?  The restaurant was oddly empty considering we arrived at noon and left around 2pm (in fact, there was no one there by the time we left.) The menu had tons of choices and even a special \"vegetarian\" section, highlighting the few meatless dishes available.  I ordered vegetable fajitas. They weren't bad. The vegetable choice was great, but it was lacking flavor. I suppose it was \"healthier\" that way, but if you're going in that direction, why not offer wheat or whole grain tortillas?  The prices were pretty high, but the servings are large enough for 2-3 small meals. The service was outstanding--I think I was offered a drink refill at least five or six times. My boss joked that we were getting great service because he had four women with him. He may have been right. I'm okay with that.  Oh, and if you order guacamole, someone will make it right in front of you, to your specifications. That was pretty neat.  I probably won't return, but it wasn't bad--just not outstanding."}
{"text":"We have been in town for two weeks and we have eaten here seven times! We've brought two different groups of people and they in turn visited a second time.   Amazing food. Great atmosphere, very helpful staff from the cute hostesses to the waiters, bartenders and mariachi band!! We'll definitely be back next year!!"}
{"text":"No More - gave it another try and bad experience again. The food is good but no better in quality as the nearby little Mexican take out diners. They display their food nicely in a beautiful environment. You should never have a bad experience at a restaurant, especially Mexican Restaurant, that has the high prices this place has. It's a special treat to go there for the ambiance and fabulous view of Las Vegas. But the last two times (Latest this week) it has been really bad from the management especially. First time we took a special out of town guest because she likes Mexican Food and is a vegetarian. There are vegetarian items on the menu but three times and long waits in between they put meat in all of her food. She never got her dinner-nor did the manager even stop by to help. The rest of the table ate as she waited. Second time - We received a promotion in the mail from the restaurant which advertised their happy hour and a 15% discount. We said \"Hey, we haven't been there in awhile, lets go.\" The promotion pulled us in. They would not accept the promotion we received saying that it was for the dinner hour only. (which the promotion did not say and we called their attention to) Still no deal. Now keep in mind, this made our experience so negative and for only a $2.25 promo. How cheap can they get for a classy place. And once again the manager did not come by to help. Our family knows this restaurant back in the day when it was just a little cart downtown Las Vegas. What a shame. I sure hope the downtown Vegas location is still good. We will never return to the Henderson NV location on Carniege."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place for great Mexican 2 nights ago so we came then and again tonight! I have lived in 3 states and I can honestly say this may be the best Mexican food I have ever had!   First night we had 2 frozen margaritas, one regular, one Cadillac both amazing! Then I had the fried tilapia (HUGE! And delicious!) and he had the steak rancheros....I would NEVER expect their New York steak to be as tender and flavorful as it was..OMG! I ate half of his steak and we took half the fish home! Wow! Then we had the fried ice cream with bananas and fire rum...VERY alcohol flavored. Id probably go with something a bit less next time. But still great! Our server and backwaiter were both very attentive and amazing!   Tonight it was so busy so we sat at the bar while waiting. Had a mojito and pi√±a Bonita which was sweet but STRONG! Tipsy before hitting the table! The bartenders were slammed but still so sweet and helpful! Then I had a skinny marg on the rocks (fresh lime juice instead of sweet and sour) and let's just say I couldn't drive home! Had the steak cognac with mushrooms for him with the NY steak again and I had the bone in ribeye with cilantro lime sauce. Omg both were so tender and amazing! Cooked perfectly to a med rare and SOOOO huge and delicious! Service was great again from the management to the server and backwaiter along with the bartenders.   We both work in very nice fine dining and steak houses in the Venetian on the strip and know good food, service and atmosphere....this place has it!   I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant for its drinks, food, service and VIEW of this strip/city!! We live down the street and have found our regular spot!"}
{"text":"Great food, service, and presentation! The carne asada was a little dry, other than that everything else was great!"}
{"text":"Great place to go eat really great authentic Mexican food. This is my first time eating in this place while staying at las  vegas for 4th of July and I love it."}
{"text":"Excellent service, an over indulgent menu, in a euphoric environment.  They did not get \"Best in Vegas\" for nothing.  The live Mariachi Band adds an authentic touch in an already euphoric environment."}
{"text":"I love Lindo! From their fresh guac to their incredible bean dip and handmade tortillas.. It's just the best. I normally get the pollos sarandeado and it is spot on. In fact, all the chicken dishes are tasty."}
{"text":"Why have we not been here more often? Great service! Great food! Homemade tortillas. High booths to keep kids in check. Oh and.. Amazing Margaritas!!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Las Vegas.  (Tell 'em it's your birthday)."}
{"text":"Man how I have wanted to try here SO bad. You see the brightly orange color building right off Horizon Ridge and then read wonderful reviews, my hopes were SO high!  It's a holiday, so I get it's busy. I get staff is tired and working hard. The gal setting our party of 3 was pleasant and suggested a great table. VIEW WAS BEAUTIFUL!  You could see the full strip and all its beauty!  Lunch is Mon- Friday till 5!! Sweet! How great is that! We all found plenty of food choices from the 3 lunch price tiers. It was a little difficult to figure out anything but the basics at every Mexican restaurant but help from google of a few words we could figure out everything just fine.  Waiter was horrid. It was over 20 mins before he greeted us then he took others orders before us and even coming back. People who came and were seated after we ordered got their food before us! Shrimp was cold, beans, rice, steak alllll cold. I had hair like things on my steak and my daughter had something non edible possibly plastic or some other material in her food. Before ordering I asked what was on the plate. He didn't say any vegetables and left out the fact of a extremely hot larger pepper that was all over the steak. This made it unable to eat for me for I can't do spicy like that. As I write this at home my lips are still numb and burning.  A positive is omg wonderful bus boy. Our chips were non stop filled and our drinks never empty. He didn't speak English well but he was able to get what we needed or asked someone to help him! I wish we could of just tipped him! I'm honestly sad I didn't get his name but I did post my receipt and in hopes staff will acknowledge him and his kind efforts. Bean dip was so good. Could of lived off just that!  If this was my only chance to visit I would of seen this as a fail to vegas eats! Maybe I'll see about a non holiday try but it's hard to look past the dirty wicker baskets they place on your bowl of chips that holds your tortillas (I couldn't even use them after seeing the grossness) then again the hair and plastic we ended up not eating most of the 3 meals ordered and what we did was carefully picked thu and still praying it will be ok.  Did stop and talk to a manager and all that was said was why didn't we ask for him? Well you see sir- your waiter wasn't around to do his job let alone for me to ask for you- I however tracked you down to inform you of his piss poor service."}
{"text":"Gets three stars because of the service and the view. Both of which are great. The prices are way too high for the quality of the food that you get. I work near East Los and this place would shut down after two weeks there."}
{"text":"I went to the horizon ridge location for my brother's bday. The staff were very friendly.  And they were very accommodating.  I'm vegan and was still able to find lots to eat. Although they didn't have the vegan tamales,  they do have a vegetarian section that can easily be made vegan.  I had the vegetable enchiladas with the green sauce topped with avocado instead of cheese. Very filling,  I took half of it home. Also unlimited chips and beans. We ordered guacamole,  which they make fresh at your table. It was very good.  I also ordered a mango mojito which was very tasty.  Overall this is a nice place where anyone can eat. The view is really great too so make sure to get a seat by a window so you can gaze on the strip as you eat"}
{"text":"I loved the place! Everything was delicious!! I had enchilada a suizas.. Mmmmm!! Service was outstanding!! Hector and Arturo were great. Definitely coming back again and definitely going to recommend Lindo michoacan to everyone!!   P.s. margaritas Cadillac are delicious!!"}
{"text":"Went there Sunday night for Dinner with my Children.  Not a native of Las Vegas, Live in LA.  But I will tell you the food, the drinks, the ambiance, and the entertainment were beyond great.  I have a favorite in LA and this trumped it.  The home made tortillas were great.  The beans were like my mother use to make.  Recommended for the hispanic who misses Mexican food."}
{"text":"Best food, best service, best atmosphere - this place has it all.  My family and I go often and are never disappointed. The only Mexican food place we go to  now to get our spice fix!"}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on Yelp and thought I'd take a friend for her birthday. GREAT SERVICE but the food was pricey and just ok. I felt rushed and wanted to tell the guys to step back and let us eat. For the two of us for a couple of drinks and dinner with tip was $80.00. Not sure Ill go back just for a non celebrative bite."}
{"text":"HUGE menu with a mucho grande selection of south of the border culinary delights!  I usually go for the basic combo plates and I've never been disappointed.  Their enchiladas are my favorite, but then again ... If it has melted cheese in it, on it, or near it, I am going to order it.  They give you fresh tortilla chips and their house salsa plus bean dip upon arrival, and it is all mucho yummy, although the salsa is a little HOT for this gringette.  I'd prefer pico de gallo, but that is just me.  Very good Mexican food served in a lively environment by a friendly staff.  And their homemade tortillas are completely addicting -- You have been warned."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, lots of choices.  Great view if you're at the bar.  not a great place to gamble though ;)  It super loud so if you don't mind that it's fun.  Some of the seating is way too close together so try to get a booth, we were seated in what seemed like a cage the last time we were there and actually we all had to move tables and chairs just to get out! but the food is good :)"}
{"text":"I can't seem to figure out why this place is always so busy. Not authentic Mexican food it's ok,  but the ambiance is good and music is alright."}
{"text":"Knew this place was legit when driving up & the parking lot was packed on a Tuesday. First they give you beans & salsa to go with your tortilla chips. Everything is freshly made. Wasn't sure what to order for the 1st time. So I went with a combination plate with a tamal, beef crunchy taco, & burrito. The food was excellent. Couldn't finish it. I will definitely try more of the traditional food next time I'm in town. Lastly the customer service was great."}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me here because it was her favorite Mexican Restaurant. After meeting up with her and trying out the food, i can see why. And she's got great taste  I had the Camarones a la Diabla and she had Camarones Sarandeados.  Despite mine being the spicy dish it wasn't all that spicy. It was more of a flavorful heat vice a mace to the face zomg heat. The sides were nice as well, beans were top notch and flavorful as well as home made.   I picked my friend's left overs and the Camarones Sarandeados are simply amazing. VERY flavorful and complex almost layered in it's taste  Overall the service and food were top notch and i will definitely come back to this place to try out other things on the menu"}
{"text":"Ordered the combination #6.  The chicken was chewy.  Empty drinks was common place.  Someone in our party ordered shrimp fajitas and the shrimp was rubbery.  Guacamole was tasty."}
{"text":"It was my first time here. We came in right at the beginning of the lunch rush and I'm quite impressed. We got greeted by everyone we walked by and the service was prompt. The food is amazing, unfortunately I was full from the complimentary chips, dip, and beans, to really enjoy my entr√©e. Oh well, I guess I don't have to worry about dinner later on. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service was impeccable, we were given attention and courtesy. The employees made it feel like home, were very nice, the atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. We were seated right away, and throughout the entire dinner they never hesitated to ask us if we need anything or wanted something. Which I really really liked because they made my family and I feel the good vibes. The experience they offered was truly one of a kind, the food was delicious and well prepared. Very extravagant view of the Las Vegas strip, it's like you're in Mexico with an enchanting view of the strip. Phenomenal location, Amazing service, Such a treat."}
{"text":"Actually I haven't visited yet, but packed parking lot this Saturday afternoon means I'll return soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite to eat in between a wedding ceremony and reception. It was the closest option to the venues and the place had great curb appeal. Inside the place was equally impressive, and had a view from the bar of the Las Vegas Strip that was amazing. As an employee, I'm sure it doesn't get old.   Speaking of employees, the service was quick, friendly, and explained everything great. My family of four ordered a couple kids meals (bean burrito and enchilada), my wife got a chicken tostada, and I had a burrito which was originally a chile verde burrito, but I substituted the meat for lengua (beef tongue). The taste was awesome, and paired well with my ice cold Dos Equis. My wife also had a blended strawberry margarita which she enjoyed and I thought was very tasty.  Afterwards we all went outside to take pics with the strip in the background. Check this place out if you're in the Henderson area."}
{"text":"A friend of mine brought my gf and I here while we were visiting from L.A.  The restaurant is nice and the service was good, hence the 1 Star. Oh, I almost forgot, it has a nice panoramic view from certain areas of the restaurant; so I bump up the rating to 2 Stars (reluctantly).  I ordered the carnitas plate which was supposed to be one of the \"house specialties\" there and it was SO DISAPPOINTING.  The oil tasted old and the meat had a terrible flavor to it. I managed to eat the beans and a couple of spoon fulls of Spanish rice. And for $17.50, TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT.   The micheladas were the worst I've ever had anywhere! The red juice mix they use is nasty. Again, not worth it and way over priced!!  My gf ordered the carne asada it she had to send it back because it came out cold. Then, she tried eating the second one they brought out and the meat was rubbery. It was like chewing bubble gum. And for $15.50, TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT.  Overall the place is nice, has good service and nice decors  but the food and drinks sucks the big mojo and are WAY OVER PRICED. Needless to say, I won't be going back, now or ever.    BIG DISAPPOINTMENT...."}
{"text":"Margaritas were very good.  Although plenty of seats filled when we got there people began clearing out yet the service was a bit slow.    However, I did put in a request for a birthday surprise for my guest which they handled very well...about 6-7 employees came over, one with guitar, 1/2 a shot, a big hat and a nice simple desert with one candle in it.  Food was ok and the view was very nice.  Be sure to ask for a window seat ahead of time.  I agree with Andrea L.'s posting on 5/21/2012 that states the food was \"generic\".  Can't explain why as many people seem to like this place and I've been to many different mexican restaurants.   Atmosphere was good.   P.S. Please note that my previous review of VIVA Michoacan was actually for LINDO Michoacan. The two are separate restaurants at separate locations."}
{"text":"I have been a customer since you came to Henderson. Through the years food has diminished in quality. Ordered my favorite Carne Assad's but the Steak was so tough I sent it back. Even the salsa is horrible. And to top it off the bathroom is disgusting! Get it together people."}
{"text":"Food was bland got a taco combo shrimp carne Asada and chicken, all 3 had no flavor had to drown in salsa   The drinks were GREAT though and chips and salsa were good and the service from the employees was OUTSTANDING! If I return it's to drink and receive good service.   Price not worth it spent almost $100 for 4 drinks 2 taco plates and fried ice cream. I usually don't look at prices but when the check came I was thinking damn my main course wasn't even good I had to dr it up. If they can add more seasoning and flavor to their meat and food i'd give them 4 stars."}
{"text":"This was the first time we came here.  The food is good and customer service is excellent as well.  This is definitely one of the places I would be a repeat customer of. Thank you"}
{"text":"Eh, it was alright. The atmosphere is ok - very family-friendly. The parking lot can get quite packed and you may have to circle it a few times. The best thing here is the view. But you can't really get close to the view as it's behind the bar and there's no tables near the massive windows overlooking the Vegas valley. They don't comp drinks at the bar, even though they do have gaming. The food definitely left something to be desired. It wasn't bad. But it wasn't exactly good either. The service was friendly and mostly attentive. All in all, not a bad spot, but it wouldn't be my pick when craving Mexican-fare."}
{"text":"Great view, waiter and chip and dip guy was very attentive. I had a taco salad. The shell was very oily. Chicken was the worst. Chicken tasted as if they defrosted several times and forgot it on the grill. It was so dry I think the chicken died of dehyration. No flavor to the whole salad. This is my first and last visit."}
{"text":"If you want super authentic street style Mexican go to El Gordos. If you want sitdown, there's nowhere like michoacan in Vegas. Granted they have gotten somewhat pricy which is why I give them only 4 stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Margaritas in Las Vegas, specially during Happy Hour!  A MUST"}
{"text":"The place has good food and good margaritas so I do feel almost bad giving them 2 stars.  But it's absolutely impossible to enjoy yourself here because the band is soooo loud.  Was not any enjoyable experience for a date night.  Also, for the quality of the food, the pricing is outrageous! Frank and Fina's across the street has better food and is substantially cheaper.  I would definitely suggest other options before going here."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a round of golf. First, let's get the good part out of the way. The restaurant seems clean and lively, however, it is very loud. They start with fresh chips, a bean dip and a decent red sauce. At the suggestion of the waiter, I ordered the taco, tostada and enchilada combo. I'm not sure how, but the meals were delivered in less than 5 minutes. I wondered if they were pre-made. The plate looked good and the portions were decent and the amount of chicken was very good. The downside is that there was very little spice or heat in the meal. I ended up putting almost 3 bowls of the red sauce on everything to get the flavor up. The best thing was the spanish rice, everything else was a little bland."}
{"text":"It's been three years since I left Texas and the easy access to great Tex-Mex cuisine. Whenever I meet a fellow Texan in Las Vegas, they recommend this spot when the cravings hit. I put off visiting for the longest time, but now that I've popped in a couple of times, I can agree that they are both consistent and fairly close to what I liked back home.  The menu is huge and a bit overwhelming. I find it best to go with a combo, all of them are enormous portions. The #5 is a favorite, with a cheese enchilada (that red sauce!) and a green chile pork burrito (wet style), AND a crispy chicken taco. It's a ton of food even before the requisite chips, salsa, and bean dip, plus a bowl of warm fideo soup, and sides of rice and beans. The prices are a bit high ($15-20 meal) but the portions are large enough to share- my guy and I usually add on a chile relleno ($5) if we're extra hungry.  The service is friendly and attentive. I love the traditional decor and server uniforms. This spot reminds me of Mi Tierra on the Riverwalk, but without the tamed-down flavors for the tourists or an on-site bakery. I find that I prefer dining in the bar area where I can get in and out quickly without waiting for a table- this spot gets pretty busy, even on weekdays."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them 3 1/2 stars, but I'm a tough critic. First, the positives - the service we had was excellent. Quick, friendly and attentive. As other reviewers have said, the soup is delicious! It was probably my favorite part of the meal. The portions are pretty large, the chips/salsa was good and fresh.  Now the negatives - the flavor of the food is just okay. Compared to Cantina Laredo or the now closed Agave, it's a 5 out of 10. The chicken in my enchilada was a little dry. There was too much cheese in the chile relleno. I like cheese, but it overpowered the dish. The beef taco was a bit bland.  All in all, I was satisfied after dinner, but it didn't leave me counting the days until I go back."}
{"text":"I don't often give five stars but, this place has the best service this dinner has had the pleasure of in a long while. It's great food is only surpassed by the outstanding service... I found the drinks made perfect as well as the table side guacamole but man can they cook... If you want to find great Mexican food come to Henderson, NV they have it here ask for Julio he is wonderful."}
{"text":"Went there during lunch time.  The Parking lot looked very busy and I was worried they would take long but we were seated right away and had our server over within a few minutes.  They have tons of options on the lunch Special menu.  Food was amazing and service was top notch!"}
{"text":"I've been driving by this place for years now and finally decided to give it a try. Sadly, I should've listened to the reviews. The whole experience was eh. The complimentary chips and dips were not a favorite. The chips tasted like it came straight from a bag at the grocery store and was bland.   For the entree I got the carnitas plate with rice and beans and flour tortillas. I was disappointed with the whole thing. There were pieces of carnitas that was way overcooked and dry. My brother got a chicken dish that was covered in sauce. On its own, the chicken was rubbery and overcooked as well.   Sadly I do not plan on returning. Service was decent in the beginning but when it came time to get the check, that took forever. To a point where I was becoming impatient. The only thing I really liked was the Mariachi band."}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican cuisine I have had since moving to Las Vegas 7 months ago, the only thing more impressive than the fare is their unbeatable views of the Strip and entire Las Vegas Valley! I can't wait to go back for a dinner service!   The staff and ambiance provide an upscale, authentic Mexican atmosphere. The table offerings are fresh tortilla chips with a medium salsa and creamy bean dip. Their menu is extensive, but the notable aspect is undoubtedly their 32 lunch specials- all under $13, and numerically ordered in Spanish- such a fun touch! Portion sizes were huge! even for lunch, and everything had the homemade quality you expect from a true Mexican restaurant. I was extra impressed with their giant beef taco; I expected ground beef but received a mound of shredded beef topped with lettuce and fine cheddar cheese- the perfect blend of the more American style crispy taco and traditional Mexican flavors with the slow cooked beef.   My boyfriend and I went while he was on his lunch break; he is usually really reluctant to go to a sit down restaurant for lunch because of the obvious time concerns. After being scarred by one too many places during lunch, it starts to feel like \"shame on me\" for trying a full service result for lunch. Not the case at Lindo! Our entrees were out less than 10 minutes after ordering- no feeling rushed to scarf down your food, or even worse- having it immediately boxed as you pay the bill at the counter because it took so long.   Thanks for the outstanding and unique lunch experience! We will be back VERY soon to enjoy a dinner service with your unmatched views!"}
{"text":"At one point in time, this was our go to place for great, authentic Mexican food. But, the last few times we've gone, our experience was not so good. The portions have become smaller, the prices higher. See, the problem is the plate is the same size it has always been. And at one time your plate was served to you full. Now the plate is only 1/2 full. We just went last night. Ordered the same two entrees we just about always order. One being the fish tacos, which have always been my favorite. But this time the fish had a funny smell & taste and the rice & beans were pretty much non existent. This place has become the Denny's of Mexican food. And it's all very bland. Sad. We really miss the way it used to be."}
{"text":"I hit Lindo Michoacan up with a few gal pals because we needed to down some margaritas.  Now I knew going in that they have a mariachi band , but sometimes it got so loud by our table that we found ourselves yelling in our conversation. on the plus side they have a huge menu , so many options to fish , chicken, vegetarian and your common Mexican food favorites. For my starter I chose the fideo soup, I love it with fresh lime squeezed in, its like a Mexican noodle soup with a tomato base. I grew a bit irritated for as long as it took for our waitress to get the lime i kept asking for. For dinner i chose the chili relleno with a beef taco combo plate which was very good, too much food with the rice and beans after munching on chips and salsa before dinner. I tried the Sangria which seemed too strong without much flavor, needless to say I have had better. My next drink was a bit better a margarita on the rocks , always a good choice. We decided to push it and have dessert , a caramel torte and also sopapillas which were my favorite sprinkled with honey they are like a square fried donut with cinnamon and sugar. SWEET!  Needles to say we must have had a good time because we were one of the last tables to leave on a Friday night. I would have given more stars if our waitress had been a bit more on her game and our drinks were mixed better."}
{"text":"This place was some of THE BEST Mexican food I have ever had. Went to this location 2 times while in Vegas.   Service A+ Value A++ Atmosphere A+ (IF you like Mariachi bands) Taste A+ Wife and I ate dinner for only about 50 bucks!!  Had quesadilla carnitas, margaritas, and the nearly Devine LINDO FLAMEADO!!!  Please stop by when in Vegas. Absolute must!!!  Only complaint was that the bathroom was really cool and I felt I could only go in once not to look weird.   TERRIFIC!"}
{"text":"If you do a Google search for best Mexican food in Vegas Lindo Michoacan will be the first name on the list.  At first glance it seemed like a eclectic place with all kinds of stuff hanging on the wall.  We got there at about 6:30 pm and there were a lot of open seats, but by the time we left they were packed.   Upon the recommendation of the waiter I ordered the Carne Asada with mushroom creme sauce which was really good.  My friend ordered the    Red Snapper.  I tried a piece, kinda dry probably should have went during an off time so the cooks can better prepare the dishes.  The plates came with beans, rice and some shredded lettuce.

{"text":"I always love coming here. The atmosphere is awesome.. the food is SO GOOD! its a little pricey but its completely worth it!! The live music is fun and the birthday celebrations are fun too."}
{"text":"Even though this is my third visit to Lindo Michoac√°n, this is my first visit to this location. First, I immediately love the ambience of this location because of how cozy it is. I feel like I'm in an outdoor cocina in the heart of a thriving mercado, and I couldn't be happier to feel more at home in a Mexican restaurant. Did I mention I'm from Phoenix originally and there's a thriving Mexican/Sonoran culture there? Then, to make things even more amazing, there's a live Mariachi band, even dressed to the 9s, and they sound fantastic. The food is of course delicious, and I especially recommend the guacamole and the \"Don Francisco\". The best part? There was an area blackout! In fact the power is still out as I'm writing this! And, in true Mariachi fashion, the band *literally* played on! What an incredible experience! We'll definitely be back, and want to thank the staff for doing an incredible job keeping the house together! Well done!"}
{"text":"Great service, authentic Mexican atmosphere with huge variety of Mexican beers and margaritas including organic!  Prices are very reasonable, if you do not want rice and beans order ala carte and the prices are as low as $3.00 per item.  In fact chips, salsa and beans are free as appetizer.  This place is a great value!  My favorite items is a NY Strip with cheese enchilada and chili pepper strips.    Wayne Gorsek"}
{"text":"My wife & I were in Las Vegas for a few day and asked our Uber driver for the best Mexican food in town, he said Lindo Michoacan.  My wife is Mexican and really knows her Mexican food but thought we would give it a try.  Well the Uber driver was right, it was amazing, the people, the food, atmosphere and the best Margarita's.  It was so great, we had to go back again before we left and again amazing.  If you are in Las Vegas and want a great Mexican meal, you have to go!!!"}
{"text":"It is a pretty authentic place. It's good that it is around the corner from my house. The serving staff is great, the food is good as well. The owner and the managers are always around, which is most likely why the service is soo good. My favorite is the Carnitas al la Coca Cola. It has a sweet and smokey favor to it. Will we go back? Hey, it is around the corner from my house, of course we will."}
{"text":"Very good and very consistent quality.  Staff always a pleasure."}
{"text":"Steak was tender and tasty, but the rest of the dish was very bland. Don't get the Queso dip because its not cheddar it's Swiss and very hard and gooey.  Service & view was excellent!!  It's worth checking out and getting away from Las Vegas strip for a little while."}
{"text":"The service is not good and neither is the food. The view on the other hand is incredible."}
{"text":"Great service, awesome margaritas and good food!  Steak fajitas and pitcher of margarita only 48 dollars total!  Chips and salsa are the best ever!"}
{"text":"First time I came to this place with my family... The food was great!!! Manny, was our awesome waiter. It was my cousins' birthday & they sang Happy Birthday & at the end they give u 2 tequila shots, which took us for surprise. BIG TIME FUN!"}
{"text":"Five stars all the way!!! If you like authentic Mexican food this is the place!!! I'm extremely picky especially when it comes to Mexican food, so you know this place is worth it!! Great location with nice views, friendly and fast service!"}
{"text":"I saw all the great reviews on Yelp...was looking for some Mexican food and I was closer to the East Side of Vegas....so I thought I'd stop by give it a whirl... This place was packed at about 1:00PM on a Sunday...Families with huge tables...small tables etc.... I've got to admit they had the BEST DAMN Taquitos I've ever had in my life! Our server even gave me some Sopitos because I was asking about them.  The portions are pretty big...it's not your hole in the wall Mexican place where prices are cheap though....but definitely worth giving a whirl if you are looking for some good Mexican food in the area  Service was a bit slow but they were very apologetic even without us complaining....I'm not sure if soup is normally free but they gave us some soup as well. They give chips with salsa like most Mexican restaurants but also bean dip along with it."}
{"text":"Short version: horrible service, inedible food and nonexistent management.   And for those of you who are bored enough to read the long version, here we go! We came for dinner on a Saturday night after spending the whole day at the Highland Games and we were both starving. Thank goodness for the chips, salsa and small cup of soup cause I seriously would have been famished after we left.   I ordered the Tia Esther, a grilled chicken dish with a sauce that was described as dried chilies, secret spices and blended with a touch of mayonnaise. I like grilled chicken, I like dried chilies, I like spices (secret or otherwise) and I like mayo...on paper it sounds like a good dish. On paper. I literally had three bites of the chicken. The second two bites were just to make sure I was tasting it correctly and my guy had a bite. It was seriously like taking a bite out of a salt lick. To the point that it was inedible. I almost never send back a dish or even complain. I usually convince myself it's my fault for picking a dish I didn't enjoy. This time I couldn't stay quiet. My boyfriend could barely even swallow the bite he had.   We flagged down our server (since he never came to check on us after the plates hit the table) and explained what was wrong (at this point I was chalking it up to an accidental over salting incident) and he said he would have them remake it and package it to go. He wasn't apologetic or even kind about the situation. Twenty five minutes later he comes to the table drops the bag with my refire  in it on the table, throws the check on the table and disappears...never to return. First of all, if I had known it was going to take that long I would have said never mind, especially since we weren't able to flag him down until after my guy was done with his meal so we just sat there twiddling our thumbs. Secondly, don't be a turkey when someone is unhappy, especially when said person is almost in tears from guilt and apologizing to YOU for the inconvenience.   So basically we paid $16 for a side of beans and rice and free chips and a small cup of free soup. I'm not a happy panda.   If you think this sad tale is over, think again! I go to heat up my refired dish. Our server snarkily (I believe I just made that word up lol) pointed out that I must not like salty food so he did me a favor by packaging the sauce separately from the chicken. I'm the girl who asks for extra salt on my soft pretzels so that dog don't hunt bucko. I had high hopes that this batch would be better, I was still holding out hope that it was a mistake the first time, but lo and behold, the chicken was super salty, the sauce was super salty and together they were inedible again. I tried to do some kitchen magic by making a cream sauce to hide the chicken in and that didn't even help.   We asked for a manager to stop by our table, he never showed. The only time I saw the manager he was joking and talking with employees. I'm extremely unhappy, not only about the food but by the service and lack of empathy. In the past we have had decent meals at this establishment, but not even the soup (which is the main draw for me) will bring me back unless management reaches out to us and offers an apology."}
{"text":"One of the best mexican cantinas I've been to and the service was fast! The food was delicious and will visit again."}
{"text":"Came here for a late weeknight dinner.  Im originally from Cali so my standard for Great Mexican food is very high.  The ambiance is very festive & fun. Its a loud place with music and loud conversations so expect it & enjoy! The staff is very attentive for refills but not in your face. (by the time i got half way done writing this.. That changed. Once the large group next to us left we went from attentive service to empty glasses and searching for our server)  Now for the good part...THE FOOD:  You get seated w chips, salsa, and bean dip (the chips were nice & warm/the salsa had just enough heat) After we ordered... Yummy Soup came!!!  I order the steak quesadilla w guac : Idk if i would say the guac was the best in Vegas... It was good.  The quesadilla was stuffed with steak & very yummy!!! Hubby ordered Mole poblano: Beans & rice were flavorful The perfect Mole!!!!  All in All a yummy delicious experience!!!  We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Their ceviche is to die for along with their tableside guacamole service. Love this place..."}
{"text":"My family and I frequent the Lindo's restaurants a lot. We always alternate from this location to the one on The Loma in Henderson for the fantastic view they have!   We always get exceptional, superb service at both locations.  The staff always go above and beyond. They're very social. I haven't had a bad experience yet. The food is always good, the alcohol, even better. Their strawberry margaritas are mighty tasty.  I try to get a different dish each time I go, but top three are the chicken fajitas (come out sizzling hot), enchiladas suizas (made with cream cheese, you can't go wrong with cream cheese!), and their shrimp salad (tossed with lemon and avocados). You can't go wrong with those dishes. Tortillas are always fresh and handmade and come with some dishes, not all.   Meanwhile you wait for your food, you can either order an appetizer or just stuff your face with the chips/beans/salsa that they put out for you. If you're going to go with an appetizer, the queso fundido is a must, lot's of cheesy goodness! You can opt to get it with green chile strips or chorizo, both are equally delicious.   Nothing but good vibes and good food every time we come."}
{"text":"Grade of C at best. Was looking for a neighborhood Mexican restaurant, and decided to try. Barely slid in to the booth and the waiter was standing there asking for a drink order-didn't have a moment to look so way to quick on the approach. Was back quickly again with a \"ready to order\"-no smile, no personality, no interest. Feeling rushed, made a quick dinner and drink selection. The cocktail and tableside guac were flavorful, but that is where the flavor stopped. The blandest and most visually unappealing beans( a soupy flavorless paste) and bland rice accompanied my cognac chicken and mushrooms-generous portion but devoid of any interest. Prices are moderate, but dont waste your precious date nite or money dining here. I won't."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in 10 years.  I don't know why I waited to come back.  My parents were in town visiting, and I wanted to take them somewhere they hadn't been before.  After thinking about where to go and looking on Yelp, I remembered Lindo Michoacan.  EVERYTHING was good.  I had a combo plate with a taco, a burrito, and an enchilada: Superb.  Everyone else enjoyed their food as well.  Rest assured I will not wait another ten years to come back.  I'll come back again and again."}
{"text":"This location is by far my favorite because of the scenery. It's always a good time to stop by here and the service is always good one thing I will say is that you better make a reservation because this place is ALWAYS packed. My favorite dish here is the camarones a la diabla a spicy shrimp dish and the fried ice cream is amazing. You can't go wrong with anything here its good quality mexican food."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food is always great ! Both locations, the fresh made guacamole at your table is always fun to watch."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here because we've heard good things about the location on Desert Inn Rd., and this location is closer to us. The food was a pleasant surprise, and although dinner was a bit pricy, the portions were large enough for us to have next-day leftovers. My cochinita revolcada (carnitas sauteed in multiple salsas) was delicious, and the pork was cooked perfectly - juicy and tender enough to cut with a fork. I'm not a fan of refried beans, but the beans served with the tortilla chips and salsa was good enough for us to ask for a second bowl. The good food coupled with the excellent service will definitely bring us back again."}
{"text":"I loved this place the food is amazing the tortillas remind me of my grand's home made tortillas in Mexico the drinks are excellent and the custumer service is great that why I tipped them 20% my parents and friends recommended me this place and live going there all the time. I can't wait to go visit their other locations my friends have told me great things about the other locations  I had the chicken enchiladas and they were great but the steak picado that my brother had is definitely something I want others to try it's amazing"}
{"text":"The good:  The food is pretty good. If you can get a table near the window, the view is great. (good luck here).  The bad:  The wait is 30 minutes for dinner The tables that are not right near the glass don't have the view The prices are fairly high. $18+ for most dishes."}
{"text":"Great service!!  Our waiter (who had the hair of Clarke Gable, absolutely gorgeous) was attentive enough that we never wanted for anything, but not overly attentive to the point where I felt like every story I was telling the person I ate with was interrupted.  The food was good, though I've had better.  The drinks were delicious!  Good experience for sure.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"All of the Lindo and Bonito restaurants in Las Vegas are my absolute favorite Mexican food restaurants. Their food is fresh and authentic. I have been going to them for many years and will continue to go there as long as they keep doing what they are doing. I was at this location lastnight for my friends birthday dinner and as usual everything was delicious and the staff was wonderful. Great place I recommend them highly to anyone looking for good authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch while I was waiting for my husband to finish a meeting.  I decided to sit at the bar and play a little blackjack/poker.  I ordered a glass of wine and a single cheese enchilada.  Both were okay, my only question is when did they stop comping drinks when you gamble and when did they start rounding up the bill so you get no coins back??  The bill came to $10.75, and she gave me $4.00 back, not that I would not have left it anyway but should it not be my choice?? Just saying, do not like the trend!!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Took my friend here for his birthday and I feel like the food was missing salt! My son loved the soup."}
{"text":"Stop by here for lunch for the 1st time.  The food was great, loved the michelada and the service was excellent!!  Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"We come here frequently. The food and drinks are great and so is the view of the strip. I would highly recommend Lindo Michoacan."}
{"text":"If you love Mexican food then this is the place too be its like a home cooked meal the staff is amazing and Leo is the best manager make his regulars feel like we are part of the family all around the best mex food in Vegas I don't know about the others but this location is where you need to be just talking about it makes me hungry"}
{"text":"Yesterday was the second time I have tried this restaurant (04-15-2012). The first time the food was ok, but the service was great. And the view of the valley is amazing! This time was anything but good! The food was again, just ok. But we were just going out for nachos, so it is hard to mess those up. We sat at the bar. They had 3 bartenders on, not a one of which had a clue what to do. It took forever to get our drinks, and we were never once checked on when we got our food. When we sat for 20 minutes with empty plates and empty drinks in front of us it was obvious we were not going to be offered anything else so once we finally got one of the bartenders attention and asked for our check we were told just a minute. Five minutes later we still had no check and she was just walking around behind the bar putting glasses up. We then asked another bartender for our check. Again nothing. By now it has been almost 40 minutes trying to get a check. I am still unclear as to the problem since there was only 2 other couples at the bar during this whole time, and the restaurant was not very busy either. So 3 bartenders would have been over kill in any other restaurant in town. But not a single one of them seemed to have any idea what they were supposed to be doing so I guess they needed all 3 idiots. We finally went to the hostess stand to ask someone to get our check. When asked how our dinner was I smiled and let them know the view is amazing, the food was ok, but the service was so bad that I would never be back, and to keep in mind I have a very big mouth and will probably be telling everyone I come across about what a bad experience this was. I am a local bartender as well. I come across quite a few guests in that  general area. I would think with so many choices for mexican food in this town and so many restaurants struggling to stay open in these tough times they would be able to find someone that actually wants to make sure the guest is happy. I guess the fact that their food is just ok, and they don't seem to have to strive for better there why bother with the service? The name on our check was Adriana. I have no idea which of the 3 she was, but it really doesn't matter. All three were equally as bad with their skills, or actually lack their of!  Save your time and money and go someplace that actually appreciates your business. This place obviously does not!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, and great service! When we're in town, we eat here A LOT! Delicious, strong, fresh margaritas with amazing buy one get one free happy hour. Best Mexican restaurant by far."}
{"text":"This place always has great service. There is tons of options to chose from! So far i have liked everything ive tried from the menu. I usually go for lunch tho because dinners are so packed sometimes there is no parking!!"}
{"text":"This place is OK. Used to frequent it a lot and it was much better,has faltered over time,get'em in,get'em out attitude nowadays.  Casa Don Juan's on Sunset is our go to place now,amazing service and fresher food."}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down the BEST Mexican food I've ever eaten. And I have frequented a lot of Mexican restaurants in my life. This is the second time I've been here. Chips and salsa are great. The sopa de fideo is complimentary and delicious!  My quesadilla was full of delicious flavor and my husband and friends raved about their meals too.. Tacos, enchiladas, and crispy chimichangas. My margarita was potent but tasty. Oh my goodness you have to check this place out. Come ready to eat! You will leave full and happy."}
{"text":"I popped into Lindo for a quick bite to eat before meeting a client. I sat at the bar and was greeted quickly and served chips with bean dip and salsa. The beans were meh. I added salt but that didn't seem to improve the flavor. The salsa was boring it had no spice. But it was complimentary so I really shouldn't complain too much. To drink I ordered a Tecate preparada, which is beer with lime, salt, clam juice and hot sauce. You can pick your beer by the way, I just felt like Tecate was a good option and it was. That drink was so good and refreshing on a hot summer day. They also have margs and a few other speciality cocktails if beer doesn't tickle your fancy.  I didn't want to eat something super heavy, so I just chose a steak quesadilla. It came out in less than 5 minutes so props to the kitchen for the speedy service. It was good but nothing memorable, it was just a quesadilla. It came with a very small amount of sour cream and guacamole on the side, like a squirt of each which was disappointing. Anyway I was in and out within a half hour, and paid less than $20. Not great, not bad, just OK."}
{"text":"The fiedo soup is great. The side of warm refried beans with our chips and salsa was a welcome surprise. Our server was amazing with great service during the entire dinner. The food was amazing and we'll definitely be back. Couldn't believe how many people continued to visit our table for;  refills,  chips,  extra napkins,  tortillas,  cleaning,  etc...  A well oiled machine."}
{"text":"Celebrated my parents 33rd wedding anniversary here. They put sombreros and give celebrants shots of tequila while they sing to you! Such a fun environment. I highly recommend you book a reservation because it gets packed... for good reason! It's a popular spot. And if you're lucky they'll seat you where you have a nice view of the city. Food is phenomenal! 5 STARS ALL AROUND!"}
{"text":"Prolly one of the better meals I had in Vegas in my most recent visit.  I have had really bad luck when eating in Vegas, so feel free to recommend any great places, hole in the wall, or anything above.  Yelp was good to me this time, quick search yielded Original Lindo Michoac√°n no too far from where were so we went for it.  Nice service, check cool place, check good food, check good prices, check  As said before, one of the better meals I've had in Vegas"}
{"text":"Don't go here. The food, drinks and service are all bad. It's the kind of food that tastes low quality and you know you are going to pay for later."}
{"text":"Coming from southern California I know about authentic Mexican food, I was very impressed with this restaurant in Las Vegas. The Coca Cola carnitas were well prepared,very delicious and the portion was perfect,the service was great never had to wait for a refill on my drink and the chips,bean dip and salsa were so good...I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I was looking for a fantastic Mexican restaurant because a dear friend was visiting from Scotland, and she enjoys Mexican food but there isn't much of it across the pond.  So I was looking for a \"best of Las Vegas\" experience for her.  My family and I had previously been to the Desert Inn location and it was pretty good, so I thought this would be good too.  To be honest, I'm sorry I chose this restaurant.  It was \"ok\" but not the type of memorable experience I was hoping for.  The minuses:  One of my enchiladas had a cold spot in the middle.  The shredded chicken was dry and flavorless.  Someone in our party said that \"she could taste the margarita mix but not the tequila\" in the margarita.  The flan was too sweet, (yes, I know that dessert is supposed to be sweet, but it was so sweet that the rest of the flavors were overpowered.)  The service wasn't all that great.  After our table was cleared, I waited for a while and then went to go find the waiter to ask for a dessert menu.  Things like water refills and the check seemed to take a while, even though they didn't seem busy.    Normally I would have scarcely noticed these things if it were just a casual dinner out, but under the circumstances, it mattered.  It was a weeknight and a bit late, so maybe that had something to do with it.  The pluses:  The tableside guacamole is a nice touch, even though the flavor was missing something.  Cilantro?  Also the food was not overly salty, which is often a problem with Mexican food.  And of course, sopapillas.  Sopapillas are always a plus.  We'll probably be back now and then if we are in the area, but not for special occasions or guests."}
{"text":"Had Christmas Eve Dinner here with some of our family. Service was quick and our large order was served promptly and the meals were all very good. Their table made Guacamole was delicious along with bean dip and salsa for their never ending fresh chips. They also serve you a cup of Fideo soup that is delicious prior to your meal arriving. All 8 of us enjoyed our meals and the entertainment tonight. The menu is large and varied so be prepared to have a lot of options to choose from. The views from this restaurant in Henderson are incredible as you can see all the lights on the Strip and as far West as Red Rock Canyon. Plenty of parking and very busy, go early or make reservations."}
{"text":"This place has the best Mexican food in town, the 2nd best is Richardo!  The homemade Guacamole is awesome! An idea how fresh it is, they bring it to your table and make it right their in front of you and you get a lot of it as well! The house salsa is awesome, it may be a little too hot for some but very addicting! They also bring out some bean dip as well.   I have had several different items on the menu from the Burritos, the tostada and the carne asada - which are all were leaving you to want more!!  The bar drinks are great as well and a very strong!  This place has been in town for years, one of the very few places where they never disappoint you!"}
{"text":"Bommmmmmm!!!! So first when they seat you not only do they give you salsa like any typical restaurant but they give you a bowl of beans to dip your chips also. If your looking for Authentic mexican food this is the place to go, the Service is great. There micheladas are great. I got a chicken plate that included a taco, tostada, enchilada they were all great! My husband got the carnitas they were good also. Came here around 12 and they walked us right in and seated us. Would definitely come back here again"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food, very authentic, they also make guacamole table side.  Service can be a little slow but overall the food is decent."}
{"text":"We came here with family from out of town! The atmosphere was great with a live band and the view looking over the city was gorgeous. The bean dip and chips were a great starter. I ordered the carne asada burrito and it was awesome! We will defiantly  be returning!"}
{"text":"Been a while since I visited, this time had combo #1. Disappointed, mediocre at best. Beef taco was the shining star but only average compared to other places. Chips tasted burnt and table salsa and beans so so. Service was outstanding though."}
{"text":"Ummmmm...this place is our favorite spot.  We visit at least 2 times per week.  It is seriously amazing!  We love the food and drinks.  It doesn't get much better than this."}
{"text":"Lindo Michoacan is one of the staples for Birthday celebrations (whether real or not, they don't check!) if you're in Henderson. If you let the staff know that a party member is celebrating a birthday, they get a surprise tequila shot! What's funny is that it seems like every table is celebrating a birthday because shots were being taken at literally every table! The view is the main event, however. Sitting on top of a hill, you get an amazing view of the entire strip if you're lucky enough to get a window seat. If you don't, you can always check out the view before or after your meal. Parking can get hairy sometimes, and it's not uncommon to have to park on the street. Moving on to the food, they have your typical Mexican cuisine, but they also have some special dishes, my favorite being the birria goat stew. Don't forget to order the table-side prep Guacamole!"}
{"text":"When reading reviews I always discard the worst and the best, assuming that the worst are written by the competition and the best by friends or family members of the establishment. So I liked what I read about Lindo michoacan and decided to give it a try and I was glad I did. I am not sure if this restaurant is for everybody because if I were to take my grown kids there they would not appreciate the authentic Mexican food, because they have not been exposed to it, the only food they know about is tacos, burritos, enchiladas, tamales, chiles rellenos, nachos, etc. As soon as you browse the menu you realize that this place is different, they have dishes that you would find only in restaurants that specialize in certain kind of food or at your grandma's house. For instance they have Mole Poblano and Pipian. I ordered Camarones a la Tampique√±a. They were delicious, I had that nice flavor in my mouth for the rest of the day. Yeah, the chips, the salsa and the beans dip are OK but in reality I never choose my restaurants based on that, to me the main dishes are the ones that count. Definitely, every time I'm in Vegas from now on I will go there to taste another of their tasty dishes."}
{"text":"Wish I could say that I loved it here, but I didn't. I ordered the vegetarian enchiladas and although the portion was generous, the food lacked flavor. There was no seasoning at all. A bit of shredded beef also somehow made its way into the enchilada, luckily I caught it before it went onto my fork. Overall I was let down by the taste. I've definitely had better. The Margarita was super good though. So next time I'll just order some guac & chips, and sip on the Margaritas.  As for the waiting, my friend and I arrived on a Friday night and were seated w/in 10 mins. The server and food came out at a respectable time too. I guess we lucked out (except in the flavor department)."}
{"text":"We came here because of the great reviews. The service was excellent and friendly. I like the traditional uniforms and decor. However I found the food, with the exception of the tamal, to be bland and under seasoned and my enchilada was cold. A little disappointed that we didn't have the great experience the reviews tout."}
{"text":"Only complaint is the margaritas were a little sweet... Food and service more than made up for it. Hostess opened the door before we were even there. Eric was outstanding and made a dynamite table side guac. The home made tortillas were stellar and the habanero sauce hurt me in all the right ways. Very happy."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Best service I've ever had in Vegas and I've been here 30 years. The food is always delicious, pleasant and efficient wait staff! Been eating here for years and always highly satisfied!!"}
{"text":"This place was so much fun! We went for my friend's birthday and had a lot of fun. They had a band playing who was really good! I thought the prices were very reasonable too! When we sat down, they gave us chips and salsa AND beans. I've never had beans served at the beginning with the chips like that, but I thought it was very cool.   I loved everything. I guess the only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the veggies were kind of funny. The veggies in our burritos were peas, green beans, etc. Kind of seems like maybe it came from a can of mixed veggies you would buy at the store instead of like grilled onions and peppers and stuff that I'm used to. And my friend ordered a chicken burrito, and there was seriously only chicken in it. No veggies or sour cream or cheese. Just chicken. Still tasted great! Just kinda funny :)"}
{"text":"I visited Las Vegas in mid-July, and this was a great place to get true Mexican food away from the buzz of the strip. The atmosphere is fantastic, with costumed waiters and loud, festive birthday songs not interrupting your meal, but enriching it all the more. Highly recommend this place and would love to return someday."}
{"text":"This is one of my daughters favorite places to eat, but it is mainly for the view. It is beautiful there. I keep giving them chance after chance for the food and service and they just can't provide it. It unfortunate because it really is so nice there. The margaritas never have any alcohol in them and the food is very bland, I always leave feeling unsatisfied. It's unfortunate, I really want to like them!"}
{"text":"Rice & beans were ok, the house made tortillas better than average. Now the the entree we chose was excellent, Carne Arrencahara was all good. Only draw back it took 45 min & we got in b4 the lunch rush. They also had a great view of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The sweet cornbread is to die for! The customer service is phenominal and the view of the strip is amazing at night and during the day!"}
{"text":"I've loved Lindo for a very long time. This is my favorite location due to the view . There is always great service the atmosphere is great. They always start you off with their soup, chips, salsa, and beans."}
{"text":"I love off the strip restaurants so if you have a hankering for Mexican food, stop by. We got there after 7p on a Friday and the mariachi was playing. Also, if you like camarones al la diabla, ask to make them extra spicy.  Great service and attentive management. Will return."}
{"text":"You can't get any more authentic than this place. Superior food combined with excellent service makes for a GREAT time. Don't forget about the Mariachis to enhance the culture. Love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  Service excellent and the food was more incredible than the view.  Must get the churros!"}
{"text":"For a Local Mexican Restaurant, this place is great!!! Was amazed by their seafood salad.  Really fresh and tasty.  SO big I could only eat half.  In two avocado halfs.  THe guacamole was table-side, fresh and tasty ... I prefer no onions, so make sure you ask for it the way you like it.  Waiter was very nice...Bartenders were great...  Sat down ordered a virgin margarita... Yummy and put in my $20.  It wen up to 59.00 pretty quick.  Fun, I cashed out at $46.. That paid for dinner.  Plus my husband put in $20 cashed out at $9... Woo Hoo.  We had a great time.  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"About time. Took me 2 years to find a good Mexican place in town. Great atmosphere, unbelievable view of the valley, now let's talk food. The beans and salsa with fresh chips Awesome! Had a Fajita Burrito, again, Awesome. Wife had street tacos, and she thought they were delicious as well. Then for desert, fried ice cream, great choice. Had a margarita as well. Glad someone told us about the place and we plan on being here at least once a month."}
{"text":"Great place bar is decorated to the core I am from San Antonio and I was impressed with the authentic food and look. The waiter we had was very courtesy checking on us. We were provided chips with salsa and beans and Fideo it was a warm touch that made the experience very home like. I ordered the camarones borrachos it was lightly dressed in tequila lime sauce. Shrimp was a good size amount couldn't finish it all. Spanish rice was made with corn and green beans amazing texture. Great overall place to get good Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place is great!  A local salesman referred this as the must see place to go to enjoy the scenery and the food.  He was not mistaken!  The view is great, especially as the sun starts to set and the strip lights can be seen in off in the distance.  The wait staff were all friendly and the service was wonderful!  The food was also good, there were so many things to choose from, and not enough room in my stomach to possibly try all of them.  I would definately come back here to try out other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Hostess never smile and made us feel unwelcome, food was ok, beer was nice and cold, service was friendly but needs some work. Busser was very friendly and doing most of the work. Place looks clean I hope next time I give five stars."}
{"text":"Lindo Michoac√°n is a happening Mexican restaurant in Henderson.  I'm not from the area, but my brother had been here before and was excited to get a chance to come back.    We came on a Saturday at around 5:45PM with a party of 12.  Since it was still sort of early, thankfully, we were seated right away.  The inside is festively decorated with typical Mexican decor.  The back side of the restaurant has a beautiful panoramic view of the city.   For a party of our size, service was prompt and efficient.  Our server was friendly and attentive,  keeping our drinks and chips filled before we had to ask.    Speaking of chips, theirs were fresh and crispy and came with delicious, homemade salsa AND a creamy bean dip. So good!  Everyone enjoyed their meals tremendously.  I ordered their flautas plate, which came with SIX flautas (with your choice of meat), guacamole, crema, and rice & beans.  Delicious!  Enough for 2 people to share!  Will definitely be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This was our first trip here, recommended by a friend. We were a little leery after seeing a couple of negative reviews about service...but this place far exceeded our expectations! We were seated within 5 minutes during a very busy time of night. Our waiter was very attentive, constantly asking us how things were. Our sodas never got lower than half empty before they were being filled back up, without us asking.  And the food. There were 6 of us, ordered 6 different types of dinner, and they were all delicious. Everyone said that their food was really good. If I had to find something to complain about, I guess it would be that it was pretty noisy in there....so don't go expecting a quiet dinner!  Other than that...amazing views, delicious food, and exceptional service! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! This place has AMAZING food. My husband and I love Mexican food and we asked around for a good place and everyone told us to go here. The customer service was AWESOME. First they bring out salsa and warm beans Delicious! Then a tomato soup....yummy not your typical soup so please don't pass it up. My husband ordered the burrito Binico. He almost hurt himself because he couldn't stop eating it. I ordered the chicken enchiladas they were so good, so many flavors exploding in your mouth. Normally enchiladas are dry but not these, they were moist and very saucy.   After my husband and I were Thanksgiving stuffed they had a complimentary shuttle to take us back to our hotel. If you are ever in Vegas you must try out the Original Lindo Michoacan on Desert Inn Rd you will never see Mexican food the same way because you will always be in search of their spices."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic and the they serve bean dip along with their hot salsa. First Mexican restaurant I've visited that serves soup before your meal. Live music great food and and an extended menu to choose from. Voted best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great restaurant but you may as, well skip the shuttle service.  This year like last the driver was late.  So late we had to bag.    I even went to the effort to call the restaurant to confirm my reservation and the shuttle well before our time.    Not sure I will be going back.  On a positive note the drivers are consistent.   Consistently late."}
{"text":"This is a really good Mexican restaurant probably one of the best in Vegas. I posted that Viva Zapata is the best and still is. But the  Funny thing is i found is they are owned by the same family. The restaurant is very big with a great view of the city. That's the only reason i gave it 4 stars its too big and loud. But both are great choices. How can you go wrong with chips salsa and free fido soup!?!?!"}
{"text":"Our first time in Vegas. We get invited to this place to go have dinner. About 30 of us there so we were at one long table and one big round booth. Getting in there was tough because I had a stroller with my 9 month and EVERY server kept walking in my way instead of letting me take a seat they kept doing their thing until the manager yelled and waved for them to move. Everything was fine until the servers kept bumping into me and my son without with saying I'm sorry excuse me NOTHING out of the 9 times I got bumped into to 2 were apologized. The food was OKAY the beans and rice were cold but my enchiladas were good! Most of our orders were wrong but I'm glad I got Emily to take my order she got it right! When they started picking up plates etc they just grabbed the stuff without even asking without saying excuse me are you done with that or excuse me let me clear that up for you nothing! Before I forget I ordered a drink from Emily I got the drink within the next 1-2 mins Luis brings it out he's standing between a co-worker and I and he's asking who order the drink I'm wave to him I did! I repeated my self 3 times and called his name 2 times and still didn't notice I said the soda was mine until a serve called his name and looked my way I was so fed up after that. Would I return NO!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. I had enchiladas de mole with steak. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Not bad.  I enjoyed. So many Mexican restaurants in the area so a 4 Star is pretty darn good. ;-)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Our waiter Christian was great. The guac is made table side and is beyond good. I ordered tacos de carne asada and was blown away. Everything came out above and beyond what we thought and we were very happy with the meal. Will definitely come back the next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've had in Vegas! The Carnitas were full of flavor. The tortillas were fantastic. The menudo was bomb!  Service was second to none."}
{"text":"If they had a sign that says \"turn off your cellphones\" that would improve the atmosphere. I asked the waiter to tell a couple with a tween in their booth to turn down the program on their smartphone. No deal, so I asked the customers to please turn it down. The dad said \"why\"? I told him I came here to enjoy the Mexican atmosphere and he retorted \"don't listen.\" Trashy guest."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and the food was really good. Great service, our waiter made some recommendations that fit perfectly with our meal. The view is amazing."}
{"text":"this is my new favorite place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the service was amazing I must say. I drink a ridiculous amount of iced tea really fast and my glass was never empty!!!  I appreciate that so much!!! they were super friendly, super attentive and so fast. we felt welcomed, it's a happy environment. I had the Camerones  Abuelito Timo (bacon wrapped shrimp with Timo sauce) BOMB!! I dunno what Timo sauce is but I'm down with it. I ate all of it, rice beans. lettuce, gauc, shrimpies all gone. clean plate status. I got a taco on the side cuz I thought 'oh its just a few shrimp, I'll be hungry still ' I was wrong lol and took the taco home. after the chips, salsa and bean dip, the little soup starter they give you, the shrimps and beans and rice and gallons of iced tea lol, I was perfectly full. my husband had the Carne asada, he said it was bomb and it sure looked it, but he wouldn't let me take a picture cuz he is a butt. AND to make it even more perfect, there is a PokeStop at the restaurant and a gym!!! we literally were able to get the poke stop over and over from our table, needless to say we stocked up on pokeballs. and we took over the gym :D #goblue and we caught a buncha  pokemon. it was a great fun dinner. I cannot wait to go back. so happy I finally tried this place!!!"}
{"text":"My coworker told me about this place. So my husband and I finally decided to give it a shot. The service was absolutely amazing. We never asked for refills or extra chips. The food was out fast and tasted amazing. We can't wait to go back and bring our friends."}
{"text":"It was my first time to go to Lindo. The 4 stars is for the beautiful view of the valley, delicious food and mexican vibe for the Cinco De Mayo friday. It was very busy, packed, loud and no parking. We were able to sit at the bar so the one hour and 45 minutes wait just went by fast. We got our table and still waited 15 minutes to get our order. I had Lengua Tequila and my friends had the chicken enchilada. Both were delicious. I love the spanish rice too. It was good. Its my birthday treat so i got a tequila shot and the big sombrero put on my head while they sing happy birthday. We had a good time. But this place is not for talking with friends, its just too loud. We were yelling at each to talk. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I am a foody. So with that comes responsibilities of adventure when it comes to food. I fell in love with Lindo Michoacan about four years ago.   The fajitas never get old, and they have the best dessert. LINDO FLAMEADO!"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service I would love to go back and try many of the other dishes they have. Best Sit in Mexican food in Vegas. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Like my first visit a few months ago, service was lacking once again (-1) The waiters (both times) had to return to our table to ask what we had just ordered a few minutes earlier. Our half dozen oyster appetizer was fresh. The ceviche de Camaron was flavorless (-1), and the Lengua was a bit overcooked (-1). The ambience is good though, beautiful decor. Wait staff just seems to disappear a lot!"}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of Mexican food but my friend wanted to check it out so I said why not, the reviews were very good and its right down the street. I was impressed that the place is always busy and packed but the quality of food and service is excellent. It is probably the best Mexican restaurant I have every been to and I have been to so many I cannot count since I living in Arizona and Las Vegas. Go there and you will not be disappointed, if I was more into Mexican cuisine I would give it 5 stars, well to be fair it deserves it so 5 stars it is."}
{"text":"Great customer service . I never empty my drink. They  always refill my drink. They always check back at us to make sure we are ok. Food is excellent. My favorite is fried whole red snapper. Dipping sauce is delicious.  Fried ice cream is good too. They put peanut in. The only problem is so hard to find parking because they always busy."}
{"text":"5 stars for the great service.  1 star for the food Which gives this a 3 star review!  Food is super bland. We got table side guac it was mehhhh. Shrimp ceviche no flavor watered down. Carne asada tacos has zero flavor as well. It looked good but once I took a bite it was like it was marinated in food coloring and water. Ugh so upset!  Michelada was not tasty either. We were here a month ago and the food was much better. Today must've had a different chef and different bartender. Boo!"}
{"text":"By far the BEST Mexican food I've had in a long time! The atmosphere is amazing. Live music, great service, plus you great beans with your chips & salsa. A must try, will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite spot in Las Vegas for Mexican food. Large portions, excellent variety, and FANTASTIC service. Table side guacamole is a must. I love getting the \"Erica\" chicken plate. It's got a slightly sweet sauce on it. Very tasty. The view is incredible and I love the fact that it's not on the strip."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I'm a vegetarian who loves Mexican food. It's pretty difficult to find a good vegetarian dish that isn't just full of cheese at an authentic Mexican restaurant, but this place was great! It had tons of options, and the food was very tasty!   The restaurant itself is pretty casual, nothing fancy at all -- pretty typical of most authentic restaurants. We were served Chips, Salsa and this AWESOME bean dip when we got there. The salsa had a nice kick to it too! My Co-worker ordered a margarita that tasted excellent, and I had a glass of Sangria, which was also decent.   Both of us being huge fans of Guac, we had to order the Guacamole. Our server brought out all of the ingredients, from the whole avocado, to the lime and cilantro, and made the Guacamole right in front us! It doesn't get any fresher than that! He even asked as us how spicy we like it, so he could cut the right amount of jalape√±o for us.   For dinner, I ordered a vegetarian enchilada and a taco. The enchilada was full of fresh veggies, so it wasn't so cheesy, which was really nice. The meal also came with beans and rice, so you get really good amount for the price.   If you're in Vegas, you can't leave without coming here!!"}
{"text":"Best mexican I've had in Las Vegas.  Completely authentic."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican place in town! They have the best table side quac and I love their grilled shrimp tacos. They have a lot that is reasonably priced but depending on what you order it can definitely add up. I like to eat off of the a la cart menu because I don't care to eat the rice and beans, so it's cheaper that way. My favorite margarita is their mango margarita :) they have a late night happy hour that starts from 11pm-2am. (They also have an afternoon happy hour) Half off margaritas. It's a good time to go. Awesome view too! For the most part the service is always great and the waiters and bussers do an awesome job."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is delicious and very culturally authentic. Service is astounding and they make you very comfortable. But here's a tip! If you don't want to take home food, don't fill up on chips and dip! ;D"}
{"text":"Negativo stars for this dump. We waited so long for our server to come back to the table that noone could even remember which server was ours. Half the table received their drinks AND FINISHED THEM  before the rest of us ordered. It was a Monday with plenty of open tables so no busy excuses apply.  Oh yeah also. My wife and I shared a knife and fork. Gave up trying to get another roll set"}
{"text":"If you ever find yourself in Vegas, do me a favor and leave the strip to visit this place. If there was ever any doubt that true hole-in-a-wall restaurants exist in Vegas, this place lays it to rest. Food is delicious. The goatmeat-beer-stew is a must try."}
{"text":"I don't know what these other reviewers are talking about...  I go to this location very often. Food is always good. Service is ALWAYS outstanding. Most of the time it's busy and you need to wait, so plan on it. Atmosphere is great.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Seeing all the great Yelp reviews probably killed it for me, because I was expecting more than what I  experienced. It was good, just not fantastic. I didn't care for their salsa, which was watery and had a funky flavor, but the bean dip they served along with it made up for the disappointment. The food was good too, but I guess I just was disappointed from all the Yelp hype. Thought it would be better."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Vegas. Worth the 10 min taxi off the strip. Order the guacamole and skip a major entree or share. You'll leave stuffed and having had the best time. Live music happens on the regular, the service is spectacular & the food is perfect!"}
{"text":"My family was craving authentic Mexican food, I have lived in Las Vegas for about 5 years, always passed by this place and shame on me for not stopping!! When we walked in, my family was greeted right away. Seated, chips red salsa and refried beans. I'm not a fan of red salsa so I asked if they had green salsa. OMG it was heaven!! Absolutely delicious!! They have 36 lunch specials that include a soft drink at reasonable prices. My 2 kids received fideo soup, very nice jester to keep the kids from screaming or crying before their food comes out. I had the carnitas when I tell you they melt in your mouth, they really melt in your mouth!! Incredible flavor!! My hunny had the 2 item cheese quesadilla and shredded beef taco. He gave me a bite. It was delicious! In the back in the middle section there is a lady handmaking tortillas, I wanted to kiss her...lol they were that good! Will definitely be back and spread the word about this wonderful place!!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place to eat with a spectacular view of the strip. Live music and great food are a perfect combination for a night out with family and friends. A wonderful local eateryto take your out of town guests away from the crazy strip crowds."}
{"text":"Whenever, and I mean, whenever I am in Vegas, I visit Lindo Michoacan.  Everyone I have recommended is a loyal customer.  Let's start with, you can call the restaurant, and as long as you have more than 2 people, they will pick you up and drop you off.  Once you enter, it's a nice soft light setting.  I suggest sitting on the side where the one man live entertainment is located, it adds a bit of an ambiance.  Once your seated, you're provided amazing chips, with a refried bean dip as well as a salsa.  Order the Pina Colada, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.  I had the Chicken Fajitas, such a plentiful serving and tasteful meal.  I am unsure, but I do believe their tortillas are freshly made.  In the past, I have had their shrimp, which is also delicious.  Their service is phenomenal, they have a team of servers that stand by, waiting to help.  I can see why they have been voted a top restaurant, they never falter, and in every visit, I am guaranteed great food, time, and experience.  I must recommend you celebrate yours or your family birthday here, YOU WILL NEVER FORGET IT!  I need to end this review, I am becoming hungry and Vegas is far away!"}
{"text":"Not sure where to eat, we looked online and did some culinary reconaissance.  Someone suggested Mexican, and not knowing anywhere off the top of our heads, we went to our apps and started our search.  We honed in on Lindo Michoacan, a place on top of a hill that has sweeping views of the Strip.  We pass by it all the time, (I actually have gone there before when it was an Italian place and remember the view) looked at the menu online and away we went!!  On a Friday night, the parking lot was packed like a tailgate party at a Mizzou game!  Unsure as to how this would pan out, I jumped out of the car and ran inside to scope the joint.  Inside was an unexpected mob scene; loud and crowded with a huge waiting area full of people, I squeezed my way over to the Hostess stand and asked the wait time.  She replied 25 minutes, (which means add at least 15 onto that) so I darted back out and gave them the news.  They agreed to wait and parked the car, (apparently the cut off time was 45min.). Let the journey begin!  Needless to say we were floored.....the large, festive and ethnic interior, the effervescent if not rowdy friday throng of families, it was a barnyard full of diners, workers and food!  Even with the long lines of people, the wait was actually bearable; guests were cycling in and out of the restaurant and this place worked like a machine-good going operations!!!  What was very surprising was how Lindo Michoacan was successful as a Mexican establishment - the interior and waitstaffs' uniforms were hard-core ethnic considering its located in a land of suburban national chain restaurants.  With a full Mariachi band off to side, (horns and guitars) it added to the festive ambiance.  You couldn't be in a bad mood here!  And within the wait time stated, the hostess seated us in a room off of the main barnyard next to the windows with panoramic views of the strip. The waitstaff immediately brought us chips with bean dip and salsa and took our drink order.  The table had Cadillac Margaritas (with Grand Marnier) and beers and we decided to order the fresh guacamole.   I will say, it is an incredibly smart move to bring the chips and salsa to the table; it immediately satiates the customer if they are hungry or irritated and it helps with flow of drinking.  Getting the guacamole was the best idea ever...really fresh and light, it complimented, not overpowered our appetites and the proportions were just right; just a small bowl so as not to fill us up before our meal.  Rick ordered the Carnitas: Pork marinated with Oranges and then slow cooked until tender.  Apparently Michoacan is known for its Carnitas and served with Chiles, Green sauce and Guacamole, it was an excellent dish! Rick ate both Chiles and didn't burn his mouth....  Quote:  \"I don't what the green sauce was, but I sure did dip my meat in it!\" - Rick  Marian ordered the Enchilda Terasca; filled with cheese, beef and chicken, it was on the smaller, lighter side out of all of our dishes.  I will say, in most restaurants, there are mounds and mounds of beans and rice which is not entirely my favorite combination.  But at Lindo, they have the proportions down well; they serve smaller portions of the carbs so you're not bloated and overstuffed.  The ingredients were fresh so the sides didn't have that, 'I've been sitting her in a pot all day taste' and she was very satisfied!  Rick Sr. ordered his all time favorite Mexican dish: Chile Verde Marrano,  chunks of Pork simmered in Green Salsa, with Tomatillos, Green Peppers, Onions, Cilantro and Fresh Garlic.   His overall comments were that it was very flavorful, but usually the dish he orders had the meat stewed for long periods of time so its broken down into the sauce where this dish was more chunky.  So Alan ordered ordered the Pollo con Rajas y Cremas Estilo Stephania, grilled Chicken Breasts saut√©ed in Olive Oil with Onions, Parsilla strips in a cream sauce.  Alan had a hard time trying to decide what to order, on the the one hand he wanted to try the more traditional Mexican dishes like the Mole, but he was allured by the other more contemporary entrees, like the Gallo al Cognac.  Ultimately, the Pollo Rajas y Crema was a great choice; the creaminess of the sauce with the chicken hit the spot!  During our dining experience, the Mariachi band and a handful of singers walked around the restaurant and ultimately to our table, and we were just elated and thoroughly entertained! And although some may say it is a little cheesy and pandering to our perception of Mexican culture,  all we can say is that we had a truly enjoyable time- and in the end of our culinary experience it came down to our dining company complimenting the ambience and cuisine; with memories of a fun time with family!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the most well-known Mexican restaurants in all of Las Vegas. Great food, great service, great views of Las Vegas. My first time was great, my next time will be also."}
{"text":"I love this place. Perched on top of a hill in Henderson, they have one of the best views in all of Las Vegas. I always sit next to the huge windows at the back of the building where I can see the entire Vegas valley. It's especially nice during a storm or sunset. The staff is always fantastic. Manny has been serving us for years and we love him. He always asks about our families who live out of town but visit Vegas yearly.  Since most of the dishes are authentic Mexican it can be hard to know what is actually in them. I suggest asking the waiters a lot of questions. Please for the love of God don't order a taco, burrito or taquito at a fine place like this. Experiment a little and try something new.  They have live music many evenings and they come sing at your table if it's your birthday. It can get really loud on Friday or Saturday nights.  The building is truly beautiful inside and outside."}
{"text":"I love this place the Mole is so delicious!! From the hostessed to the waitstaff to the manager  everyone is so helpful making sure that you have everything  you need and it's just perfect to your liking!"}
{"text":"and back I am... this time I visited with my son Lorenzo, who despite his young age is well educated as fare as food is concerned...he has a grandmother who is from Naples (Italy, not Florida!) and she cooks real meals for him every day. Thas said Lindo's cuisin is still attractive. We went there for lunch and it was quite a bargaing. I will be back for the annual event of CES in january...and I'll take some of my fellow journalist and a new charming girlfriend to this place..."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and had Antonio (there's two, so the tall one) as a server and he was awesome! It was a busy Friday night and my fiance is a little indecisive and Antonio was patient and answered all of her questions patiently, as though we were his only table (even though he probably was running around like crazy). I have a severe shellfish allergy and she likes to stress it to the server multiple times because another Mexican restaurant messed one once and I had to be rushed to the hospital. Antonio made it a point when he delivered the food to ensure us that he spoke with the kitchen and my food was safe. We liked him so much that when we came back a couple of weeks later we asked for Antonio. He knew who we were right away and told us before we even ordered that he made a note of my allergy and asked us if we wanted to order a shot of cazadores (like we ordered on our previous visit). Again, phenomenal service. The weekend after I proposed to my fiance our family came with us to Lindo to celebrate and we asked for Antonio. When he found out we got engaged he sent us 2 shots of cazadores and brought us a cheesecake to celebrate. He is truly a genuine individual who we now love to come see. The food is already phenomenal and now that we found Antonio we come once a week to eat and hang out with \"our friend Antonio.\" When you come to Lindo , I suggest asking for Antonio and he will make you experience like no other..."}
{"text":"Had a great time here for drinks after work. Great drinks, friendly staff and live music. The atmosphere was really fun, I'm looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"You people giving this any more than a star have either sandpaper for tastebuds or imbibed on one too many margaritas. Big problem that there isn't a single decent Mexican restaurant in Vegas. Not only is this the worst Mexican food ive ever had, it might be the worst food ive ever had!"}
{"text":"The desert inn location is the best.   I know it's the same menu, but it just seems better than the Henderson location."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time last weekend.  The chips & salsa & beans are sooo good (a little too good because I filled up on those) as well as the margaritas.  We came early so we got happy hour pricing (even better) and the views were amazing.  We were so impressed we are going to have our rehearsal dinner here for our wedding!  The staff is really friendly and the atmosphere is wonderful. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I just love mariachis! The food could've been horrible, the service could've sucked, and I still would have had a great dinner. But it didn't. As always, we had a fantastic dinner with guac made tableside, wonderful fideo soup, tasty salsa, and unlimited bean dip!   I do feel the menu is a bit pricy and excellent Mexican food can be found elsewhere for half the price, but being serenaded with Cielito Lindo while sipping on a margarita makes for one unforgettable night!   Lindo has somewhat of a cult following and my cult friends get angry when I say that Lindo ain't all that - but I honestly don't believe it's the best Mexican restaurant in town.   Their lunch menu is a better value, so if you've heard the hype about how awesome this place is, you can get a decent lunch, drink included for around $10."}
{"text":"So worth the trip off the strip ! Excellent food and great prices. Staff very friendly"}
{"text":"Dined tonight for the first time. Waited 30 minutes. Ordered horchata and mole enchiladas. My daughter ordered lobster and steak. The view was great. The waiters attentive and friendly. However the lobster tasted too fishy and the manager came over and we explained. He proceeded to argue that he hasn't had a complaint before. I told him we know what lobster is supposed to taste like. We've had lobster at Del Frisco's and Benihana's it never tasted like that! He took it off our bill though. Won't dine there again, food is not authentic or tasty. Do not recommend it. Also the horchata was too sweet and the waiter failed to tell me that the chicken mole enchilada where actually cheese enchiladas with a dry large chicken breast on top. The chips tasted burnt and the salsa was too spicy to enjoy. The music too loud. The only reason why I rated it three stars is because the waiters were friendly. And the plate taken off the bill."}
{"text":"Lindo is one of my favorite Mexican places in town but the one off of Horizon ridge is by far the crown jewel of this franchise. This location on flamingo has the same food which is great if not a bit over priced. The staff is average. They never impress me with their service. Sometimes it takes 15 or more minute before you see your server. They serve a lot of authentic Mexican dishes so don't come here for tacos or a burrito. Try something new and enjoy the satisfaction of an experiment that panned out in your favor. My favorite is called Chicken Stephania.  The margaritas chips and salsa are all great."}
{"text":"OK, I just have to say something: NEVER go to Lindo Michoacan when you are hungry (or think you are hungry).  The food is not only tasty but you can't help but eat everything they have.  We had a very good experience (other than the horrible service).  The waiter was just standing around and we waited for our checks, for him to take our dessert order, and he was very stingy on the refills.  My partner ordered the Vegetarian Fajitas and I ordered the Fish Tacos.  The Veggie Fajitas were great but they don't give enough tortillas in my opinion.  He got 2 when it is possible to make at least 3 for the meal.  He enjoyed it for sure.  My Fish Tacos were scrumptious!  Instead of a whole, fried fish fillet, they use pieces of fish then fry them.  It also came with this spicy ranch dressing that was very tasty.  Now, I am not a fan of spicy foods (since it makes me sweat), but the ranch dressing was so good I let go of my aversion to spicy foods.  As if the meal wasn't enough, we ordered dessert!  My partner had his favorite, the Sopapillas.   I ordered the Flan.  OMG!  The flan was awesome.  It was almost as good as my mom's.  Now, that is a very good compliment since my mom makes the best flan.  It is on the pricey side, but with the gourmet preparations of the food, it is very much worth it."}
{"text":"This year we decided our holiday visit to our home in Henderson would include trying a few restaurants we'd never tried before...with the focus being a little bit on Mexican food.  Lindo was recommended by many, not recommended by a few.  We found the place to be very good.  Nice room, great view, nice surprise with the hot bean dip that came out with the chips and salsa, very good margarita, excellent tortillas and my camarones a la diabla was very nicely done.  My wife really enjoyed her meal as well.  And yeah, the service was great too.  This may be our go-to spot for Mexican food once we've fully relocated to Henderson."}
{"text":"Great authentic Spanish restaurant it's like Olive Garden for Spanish food! They have an awesome view over looking the mountains and the strip! The guacamole and the street tacos were so good! Our server Pablo was awesome he showed us an awesome customer experience! It was our first time checking the place out and it ended up being the best Spanish food ever. If your wanting some flavorful tacos check them out!"}
{"text":"Welcoming casa-style interior with live authentic music and the smell of an old Catholic Church and fresh tortillas. Salsa and beans served immediately. The chips were crisp and fresh and the salsa was delicious! It had a fire roasted tasted. Staff is outstanding, magician like! Every time my glass was empty the next second it was full again. The food, although considerably higher priced than most Mexican food, was delicious. Tacos were crispy with just the right amount of spices. I love Mexican rice and theirs was top notch! Did I mention the live music? So upbeat and classic, even though I couldn't understand the words it was still lovely. I will for sure being telling my friends about this place."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food place off the strip that offers a lot of parking, good variety on the menu, and a nicely themed interior. I believe they describe it as \"gourmet Mexican cuisine\" on their menu, but I'd consider it more of a home cooking / comfort food type Mexican cuisine.   To start off, they bring out chips, salsa and beans to snack on (and keep them full). Most meals come with a small cup of fideo soup, so after snacking on the chips/salsa/beans and the soup, you're pretty much full before your meal comes out (especially if you get a michelada which are a good size). The food is probably better than any Mexican food you can find on the strip and reasonably priced (about $15 for a combo plate or up to $25 for some of their special steak / seafood plates).   The staff are all nice and seem to hustle around (the place has always been busy when we go), but expect to wait at least 15-20 min for your food once you order. Overall a solid place for Mexican food while you're in Vegas, me and my friends always hit this place up when we go to Vegas for the first week of football."}
{"text":"Live music. great ambiance.   Love the chips and salsa. Even more awesome is the refried beans they serve to accompany them, yum! Perfect combo. FYI  don't fill up on them. Take them to go!   Customer service was attentive to our needs. My daughter spilling her soda, Her wanting extra sour cream, and us ordering more food after we ate. Difficult like always, but they didn't treat us differently. Food was fast and extremely hot. I like that,  no messing around.   The combos are big portions so watch out, if you eat correct portion size then share with a friend. the tacos are full of meat, and fully loaded. The quesadillas are really cheesy, too much cheese if you ask me, but my daughter loved it. The chile relleno isn't spicy, full of cheese and the batter is light and fluffy. I really enjoyed it. Beans and rice are good, but you can never finish them. My advice, take them to go and order a few flour tortillas to go. Lunch tomorrow my friends!   The deserts are huge too, so be careful. We ordered the fried ice cream. Big enough for two and extremely rich. Full of chocolate sauce, whip cream any tons of ice cream fried to perfection in a crisp cinnamon batter, holy hell it's amazing. What fat girls dreams are made of.   Mexican deliciousness, we shall see you again soon."}
{"text":"This is my favorite locations of this restaurant in Vegas. They are consistent with good quality food and service.  Also the side with live music and the bar is great for a night out. We always get the fresh guacamole as it is one of the perks of eating there."}
{"text":"Always a great place to come to. Food is delicious and the service is great!!! Make sure to come on Friday and Saturday so you can have a great meal when the Mariachi is here playing."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 10 times in the past two years as it's a bit of a drive for me. I choose this particular Lindo for the view which is great for out of town visitors. I've never had a bad experience here. Their table side guacamole is bomb! Love love love how fresh it is. I usually order combination dishes so I can try a couple items but I've had their traditional dishes, particularly their chicken mole enchiladas, and a chicken dish saut√©ed in oil, garlic, and white wine with peppers. It's always delicious!  Fried ice cream is also a favorite, but our server Angel heard my boyfriend say, get a dessert, it's your birthday! Shortly after, I was wearing a huge sombrero with 3 churros in front of me, and a shot of tequila was slammed on the table for me to drink! Love this place! Angel is a gem! Don't lose him!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Great food with service! I love the comfort of this place! The nice, cool and easy setting make it very easy to come back.. Music is awesome as well!"}
{"text":"MMMMM!! Amazingly delicious all the way around. This is one of my favorite Mexican resteraunts in Las Vegas.   I love the festive decor that feels like a family styled kitchen. My favorite photo opportunity is in the lobby where a coat rack holds several sombrero hanging.   The service is always friendly, accomidating and accurate! Which is huge for me right out of the gate. Their menu offers a wide selection of traditional Mexican dishes, including a vegitarian section that can easily be made vegan. (Which I did! - delicious!)  Now on to the food. Warm chips, warm bean and chilled salsa are brought to every table. Along with each main dish a bowl of vegitarian soup is brought out. All very delicious and so flavorful!  When the main courses are brought out everything is plated with creativity in mind. My table ordered the #18 combo chili reno and cheese enchilada, and the Avacados tacos. Wow!! So delicious all the way around.  ProTip: For a little spicy kick, ask for salsa on the side to drizzle over your tacos. You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Me and my sis ate here back in November after seeing it featured on Rachel Ray's Tasty Travels. I ordered the Mole Enchiladas w/ Chicken. They were delicious and very filling. My sis ordered a chicken tamale and shared my rice and beans. The chips are excellent and we both loved the beans they give you to dip your chips in. It was a nice touch. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great service but food tonight was subpar. Fajitas usually come out sizzling but came out cold tonight. The soup was bland and chips were a little stale. You let me down tonight Lindo."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! Been going for 12 years now!! Definitely the best chicken hard taco around. Love the desert too!"}
{"text":"Was some good eats  Had the chips with salsa and bean dip to start.   The entree I chose was the Tortuga Pollo Asado A.K.A a Mexican Chicken Sandwich.  Really good flavor, and was not dry at all.  For dessert had the mexican ice cream.  All in all great experience and will come back again"}
{"text":"Just moved here, decided to try some restaurants near my apartment.This was honestly one of the worst experiences I have ever had from start to end, yes it was cinco de Mayo so I understand the long wait but we ordered chips and guacamole and the guacamole had no taste whatsoever also my friend ordered a Cadillac margarita when it came out he said it tasted nothing like a Cadillac margarita but because the drinks took longer than the food to come out we decided to stick through it. I ordered the mole poblano and honestly was the worst mole sauce I have ever had. It tasted like soy sauces the only thing they seemed to know how to make was rice and beans. I wish I was able to write a positive review but honestly there wasn't anything positive about it"}
{"text":"This place seems like it would be good. But the food isn't just bad... It's disgusting! The sauces are horrible and taste like they come out of a can. Their prices are expensive but the quality of the food is the lowest. Avoid this restaurant and go to a taco shop or food truck where you pay a fraction of the price and the food is EDIBLE. Fuck this shithole."}
{"text":"Place was the real deal......food was very good and the people that worked there are very friendly!!!!!! Will be back when u go back to las vegas"}
{"text":"One of The best restaurant in Vegas! Great Mexican food excellent services!Love this place! I will go again! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful setting foe a Cinco de Mayo Lunch over looking Las Vegas.   W were lucky enough to get a window table.  The service was definitely 5 star.  Very happy friendly and super efficient.  We had a house margarita and enjoyed the extremely spicy salsa with chips.  Just like we like it.  The food was very good although for we who love spicy the shredded beef was a bit flat which was easily remedied by the addition of the great salsa.  We would definitely return when in the area."}
{"text":"This review is actually based on my second experience here at Lindo Michoacan.   If you are looking for a smashing view of the entire Las Vegas valley and you don't want to spend $$$$$ at the Stratosphere, this is your best bet! However, if you are looking for fantastic Mexican food on top of a smashing view, I'm sorry to disappoint you but this is not your place.   My first experience at Lindo was pretty good from what I recall but I had a seat right near the window and I was perhaps distracted by the scenery so much so I didn't pay much attention to the food..   The other night was \"Take II\" and we did NOT get the window seat. This fact led to more clarity on the entire dining experience. Service was nothing above standard and even slightly below if you want to get technical.   My true love in Mexican food life is a good guacamole..mmm..I was pumped about this $9 FRESH guacamole until I piled some on my chip (which wasn't fresh) and took a bite. It was filled with unripe tomatoes, overdosed in lime juice and I swear I was picking the cilantro out of my teeth the rest of the night and possibly the next day (overboard).   The food to follow was luke warm, massive and lacked flavor.. If you're wondering what I ordered, I think it was a #6? Chicken taco, enchilada, and something else that was \"soo good\" I can't remember, haha.   All in all if what you want is a great view of the city and you're not looking for fantastic service or authentic Mexican food, Lindo is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I just moved from LA (where the Mexican food is legit and there's really no comparison anywhere else) BUT LM is bomb Mexico City style food. We ordered chicken mole, camrones abuelito timo, and carnitas a la mexicana .... Bomb, all of it!"}
{"text":"Been here so many times this place is amazing usually catching lunch though lol been coming for dinner  been great"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. They went above and beyond for our group. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"If I could have the best of both worlds, it would be to have Bonito Michoacan move into Lindo Michoacan, so I could have the best Michoacan food in the best setting.  The views from the dining area are stunning.  Lindo really needs to open up a covered outdoor area...to experience the view while being outdoors would be like icing on the cake.  The food at Lindo isn't bad...it's just not as good as Bonito on Decatur.  Once you have Bonito's food, you'll understand.  If you've never had Bonito, and love Lindo, don't go to Bonito...just remain blissfully unaware and enjoy Lindo's stunning views.  I haven't had any of the alcoholic drinks there, but know people who have and they swear by them.  This is a very friendly, great service establishment."}
{"text":"Been here many times.  Food is consistently good.  Service is always excellent.  Salsa and chips with bean dip always satisfying."}
{"text":"Was okay nothing outstanding.  Mostly quiet setting,  no wait for seating,  plenty of bussers offering refills. Food was not as flavorful as I've had  in the past.  Waiter was kinda slow  but gets a pass due to the holiday.  So, in other words my experience was average."}
{"text":"BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN LAS VEGAS!!!!! I cannot vouche for this restaurant enough! First time I went here I had flown out to Las Vegas, from California, with my dad several years ago when we were looking at UNLV as a possible college for me to attend. On our last night in town our family friends who lived in Summerlin recommended we go to this restaurant as a send-off for me and my dad. What an awesome dinner we had and not to mention, consumed my first shot of tequila here! It also happened to be my 18th birthday and upon my father and friends telling the waiters this information, they swiftly retrieved a gigantic sombrero, snuck up behind me and plopped that hat right down over my head and then proceeded to throw a shot of tequila straight down my throat! Everyone at the table was shocked (Whether it was because I was only 18 and took it like a champ or that the waiters had no idea I was only 18)! We laughed for days after this and still do til this day. Such a fun night, amazing food, killer guacamole, and super attentive servers and waiters (; This may have been the deciding factor in me choosing UNLV later on. Who knows! Loved the restaurant. Still do. Visit every time I'm in town and recommend it to anyone looking for a little Mexican fix. Every location in Las Vegas is great and they are always consistent with their food! Thanks for the memories Lindo!!!! Can't wait to be back in your delicious presence again! How I fiend for you all the way from the Bay Area!"}
{"text":"First off, friendly staff with excellent service. The food came out hot and quickly and the drinks are cold. The corn and flour tortillas were hot and fresh. On a Sunday night, the place was hopping with tourists and locals. The guacamole made tableside could have used riper avocados and maybe a touch of salt, the pico de gallo was flat. My wife had the garlic shrimp, again they lacked a bit of seasoning. I had the bacon wrapped shrimp. They were very good. Overall, we enjoyed our service and the dining experience..The food was good, but not great."}
{"text":"I tried it for the first time. The restaurant has cozy environment, friendly staffs, and pretty good food. I ordered the combination came with carnitas taco, chicken Tamales, chili relleno, rice, soup and salad. The food is good but don't expect home made style food. Its more like upper scale food. However I like more home made style its just my preference."}
{"text":"So after making the choice of tying the knot in Vegas during Labor Day weekend 2016, we needed a place to have the dinner afterwards. First choice was a Buffet, but after calling so many locations and all of them saying it would have to be paid in advance and then no refund if someone did not show up there was no refund. Tried calling some restaurants serving american food, and they wanted a deposit and give a special menu, I was stressing out trying to find a location that would accommodate about 20 people. The thing about my party is that most of them are Japanese since my now wife is Japanese, so trying to accommodate every one with food choices. But come remember that they all love Mexican food. So I found this place on yelp and called to see what they could do for me. To my surprise, no special menu, no deposit and every one got there on check. But the best part was when we show up and they ask for me and my wife to go in last. They sat all our guest, and then let us in. As we came in they had the mariachi playing for us! Best entrance ever. I have to give it to this place the atmosphere was great and the food was AWESOME! The waiters were very attentive to all our needs, they were awesome! Everyone in my party was satisfied with their food. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone stopping by Vegas. Sorry to Original Lindo Michoacan for the late review."}
{"text":"This was a last minute stop on the way to the airport and a great way to end our trip. Truly authentic in atmosphere and food. We had drinks and appetizers that were delicious. Wish we would have gone for dinner. It's loud and full of locals. Will definitely go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"So i have read and heard all this hype about how good this place was and i'm here to say WHY? i have had better food at chevys or even a robertos, The place was hot as hell feels like there's hardly any ac going at all. The food was decent at best and  for the price range this would be one of my last pics for sure, the point is skip it one of the most overrated mexican food joints in las vegas"}
{"text":"Amazing carne asada burrito! Definitely going back many times."}
{"text":"I love Lindo and Michoacan! I even love their vegetarian options as well!   I have dined in this restaurant many times and my experience has always been superb!  However, this review is specifically for the catering service which the manager was very attentive to our vegetarian requests. We all know that most beans are cooked with lard which is made out of meat or pork fat etc..and the rice is made out of meat or chicken broth.  Nevertheless, Lindo was kind enough to cook vegetarian beans and rice in addition to our regular non vegetarian order. They also made avocado tacos which was so delicious!! Another veggie dish that they made was fajitas!   All were yum yum in our tums!!"}
{"text":"I use to love this place but i have noticed food and service have gone downhill. It's always very busy, which is great but service and food have taken a toll because of this"}
{"text":"I want to like this place so much! But I just don't. Here's why:  Although the beans & salsa served before the meal are awesome (could make a whole meal out of them!), I end up disappointed in my entree, no matter what I get. I couldn't put my finger on the reason for the disappointment until I read some other reviews: the food is just bland. It's not an under-salting issue; the sauces and meats, as well as the rice and beans (whyyyy can't they just put the appetizer beans with the entrees?). It's just blah. Also, considerably less spicy than I like, with no salsa at the table to heat things up. For the record, I can barely handle a jalepeno.   All I want from Lindo's is to have a flavor jump out at me. Currently, what I get is a mass of bland that needs to be washed down with a drink.   Also, if you find EXTREMELY LOUD mariachi music as obnoxious as I do (it has got to be more than just me!), skip this place or ask to be seated in the room with the view."}
{"text":"I am Mexican , and i love Mexican food !  I do like Lindo Michoac√°n ! However there are just too many places near by that are easier choices !  The location and parking of this place is perfect.   There a couple things that keep me from coming here more often   1. The number one reason  I tend to choose other places is .....the pricing of Lindo. They are a little too pricey for me.   2. They have a large menu but it's almost too large and not only is it too large, they limit your options and almost force you to spend $12 or more no matter what. For example they have 1 side soup option which is Fideo soup . Everything else is offered as a main entree.... for example they have seafood soup entree, beef soup chicken soup etc . They don't offer cups just large bowls and the bowl of chicken soup we ordered was too large and far too expensive for the rubbery over cooked chicken that came in the chicken soup. A cup for $6 would have worked!   3. Their chips and salsa were mediocre and the bean dip was and is never very tasty.   4. The good thing about Lindo is they are not terrible as a matter of fact i enjoy going for brunch . They do have machines if you like to play and TVs at the bar , a good selection of seafood , good food and they do have good service !"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended for Cinco de Mayo. My friends and I went with great anticipation. NEVER AGAIN.  We arrived at 6.15 seated by 635...so far so good.. my friends ordered drinks and we ordered dinner, nothing too complicated and then waited, and waited, and waited .....in the meantime they put a mariachi band (six musicians) that remained in our part of the restaurant for over half an hour, they were SO loud we could not converse AT ALL without shouting. Normally musicians will move around so you can enjoy a song and then carry on a conversation!  After repeatedly asking where our dinner was, witnessing others receive their dinner who were seated after us and ONE AND A HALF HOUR later we gave up and walked out. I believe we exhibited great patience as it was Cinco de Mayo but it was a DISGRACE.  Extremely disappointed and will not recommend or ever return."}
{"text":"One of the very few places that is actually authentic and tastes so good! My fianc√© and I went here the other night and the environment was super cool and the girls up front l were really welcoming. Our servers name was Yordon (if I'm spelling it right) and he was super chill and just very helpful. And those raspberry margaritas! Bomb. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"The food is good really filling !! Usually when we end our Vegas trip we have breakfast here it's not too bad great drinks!"}
{"text":"AWESOME...AWESOME...AWESOME!  HUGE portions!  Great prices...pretty darn good (not perfect, but good) service. I would go back in a second!  Gave us a free ride (paid them a \"donation\") back to our hotel about 10 min away.  My only complaint:  the stupid music players.  OK...it is someone's birthday..play them a song and sing and move on.  We were there with another couple and could not even talk for literally almost 20 minutes because these guys kept on playing and singing in the main room right beside us.  This is NOT for a social dinner.  I honestly, seriously...honestly almost asked them to shut up and let us eat/talk."}
{"text":"I've been eating a Lindo for years.  Yes, the one on DI is better but this one is solid. We usually order one of the steak (cilantro or ranchero) or shrimp (Dionisia or ranchero) dishes. It's been over a decade and not once has the food been bad.  There's something to be said for consistency.    Thanks Lindo."}
{"text":"Very delicious guacamole, love their margaritas! The kids meals are good price and the kids loved it!! Love their shrimp ceviche, dynamite."}
{"text":"Have a craving for Mexican (or just margaritas)? This is your place!   They have a huge menu, so it can be overwhelming if it's your first time at the restaurant. I stick to a couple things that are my fav: carne asada, enchiladas, fajitas. And definitely order the guacamole, they make it right at the table the way you like it, delish! This restaurant has a great view of the strip and they have a band playing traditional music. With that, it is very loud and very hard to talk. I don't recommend this place for large groups for that reason.   Helpful Tip: Take it easy on the chips. The waiters are on top of their shit so if you're getting low on chips, they will immediately spot it and refill your bowl... causing you to eat WAY too many chips and be completely full by the time your meal shows up. This situation never ends well since you feel obligated to eat a little of your meal even though there is absolutely no room for it."}
{"text":"The best Mexican meal I have had in as long as I can remember. The shrimp ceviche was perfection.  The service was spot one. 5"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat when we are in town. I love the table side guacamole and the enchiladas. Service has always been great and I love the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"drinks are absolutely fab, and honestly food is really good too. I love the bean dip with the chips (versus just the typical salsa). great views too-- but parking sucks.. Lot and street are ALWAYS full"}
{"text":"Average Mexican food. I thought all the entrees I've had there were nothing special but I do like their chips, salsa, and bean dip. Beautiful view of the city and there's a Mariachi band at night."}
{"text":"This is a rather unique place and its clear when you walk in that the Mexican theme was not the original idea.  The food is not bad nor is it great, its neither super authentic nor over the top tex-mex, some dishes works well and others are boring and uneventful.  The service today was underwhelming and not up to expectations, if you combine that with the robot like waiters who roams around and just removes stuff regardless of you are finished or just continuously drips of soups you don't want, and then getting the bill took way to long.  This is not my favorite place but again, the food is not bad i thinks the overall experience does affect that and i just think that there are better places right around."}
{"text":"This location is vastly superior to the Henderson location!  The food is more flavorful and the service is really, really good. I've always ordered combinations and haven't been disappointed. Also, the \"Burro Bionico\" is very tasty! I'd advise coming here when very hungry, as the portions are enormous.   This is my go-to when visitors tell me they want Mexican food. It always gets rave reviews!"}
{"text":"I'll get straight to the point - by far the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. I grew up in Vegas and after living in Canada for 6+ years, I began to really miss great Mexican food. There are many places around town that offer great Mexican food, but none like this one. They go beyond the food. The life music, overall vibe, and outstanding service is something you won't find in many other places.   Favorite menu items are Queso Fundido with Chorizo, Tacos al Pastor, and Pollo al Pipian. My only negative mark would be on the desserts. Stay away from that flamed fried ice cream!"}
{"text":"Fresh..made to order Guacamole! This is a must stop while im in Vegas.   This location isnt in the safest neighborhood but once your there you forget about it.  Ive tried a number of food dishes here and all were good. They give you so much food that Ive never made it to dessert.  Whats interesting is the soup they give. I think its some kind of buck wheat noodle soup. Its good but just different."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to come here to celebrate our first anniversary.  The atmosphere is great.   The place is very busy as always.  The staff is polite and works very hard.  The food how ever, while tastes great just isn't what it used to be.   The shrimp tacos came without anything on it.  All the garnish was on the side and there wasn't much of that at all.   This place used to really wow..  now it's average at best.   Maybe it was just an off night because of how busy it was.   Will definitely be back. But it's just not as great as it has been in the past."}
{"text":"Service? Amazing, like, truly. Food? AMAZING.. Everything.. AMAZING!  ... thats all :)"}
{"text":"Such great food and service! Every time we go it's always a full house (probably because the food is so amazing)! Their mango margarita is so flavorful but still strong. The only thing is it's REALLY loud with the live music and so many people but the view of Las Vegas makes up for that. Highly recommend for some good Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Not shabby for American style Mexican, def better than Ricardo's.  Service is never great here. They take your order, bring your food and then your bill... The chips and salsa are good. I had the chile relleno and enchiladas... Of course mom makes them better. Ain't nothing like homemade authentic food. Prices are reasonable and the location is easy to find. Clean and cute place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Delicious food in a beautiful setting & fine service, plus big windows for a view of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to bring your friends to embarrass them on their birthdays, the whole teams plays guitars and sings.  I'm surprised at the negative reviews. I have dined here on numerous occasions and experienced very capable and fast service. Menu is huge yet repetitive however there are great flavors and well executed regional dishes to be found. Michelada's are great and they are on the table in seconds. I like the nopales & roasted jalape√±os on fresh tortilla as well as the birria.."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. 1/2 hr after being seated we were still looking for our waiter. Then it took an hour before the food arrived. I had the Chili Colorado. Bad. Wrong cut of meat was used, and it was improperly prepared and then served in what tasted like cheap canned enchilada sauce. Even the margarita didn't come as requested. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Bland food just like every other Mexican place I've tried here. Nice place, great service."}
{"text":"Don't waste you money going here. You can to robertos and get the same thing. It taste way better at robertos and half the price!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this place I had something off the lunch menu they have a lot of good options for cheap on their lunch menu. They serve unlimited chips and salsa and they even give you bean dip with it so that was really good. The food was yummy and the service was good I love the coconut margarita, my only complaint is that my lunch portion was pretty small I expected it to be smaller than the dinner portion but it was a shrimp dish with only five pieces of shrimp and then a small side of rice and beans so it wasn't completely filling. But I'll definitely be"}
{"text":"It actually breaks my heart to write this review. Any other time I have been here I've always received excellent service and the food has been awesome....until yesterday... My boyfriend both worked  half days yesterday so we decided to meet at Lindo for lunch. We sat at the bar because it was lunchtime so obviously we knew it was going to be packed. The bartender was really nice and served us right away...then it all went downhill. My boyfriend order the chicken crema y rajas, i ordered shrimp mojo de ajo. When the food came out, mine was chicken instead of shrimp so I sent it back and the bartender apologized. It was fine I had time to kill anyway. Boy oh boy... As the server put the plate down, all the juice spilled all over my dress!!!!!  It was HOT!! But sh.. Happens!! When I looked at WHAT was on my plate .....it was the poorest excuse of ajo I have ever seen in my life!!!! Very watery, no garlic, it tasted like lemon water with a bit of tomato!!! I know this dish well since I order it all the time. At this point i start getting mad!!! The bartender said she was going to get the manager which we waited and waited and waited and waited but she was too busy getting chips for the five gentlemen that were seated at the bar next to us. Being a manager you might want to take care of the serious problem at the end other end of the bar first just saying.... At this point I am soaked in shrimp, tomato lemon water. My dress is ruined..and Im still hungry. My boyfriends appetite was ruined so he just boxed his up. All I got was an apology and the shrimp removed from the bill. This was THE worst dining experience I ever had. Its sad that it had to happen here. The manager should have done more on her part to rectify the situation. Not everyone in management deserves the title.   And p.s.... I never got my soup either. :("}
{"text":"Fish mojarra deep fried always fresh....they have great service...little pricey on the beers but great pi√±a coladas....and their house soup is delicious....nice atmosphere...good hours....but very packed for holidays...parking in the front cant go wrong...corner spot so cant complain"}
{"text":"I love the carne asada and guacamole. The flour tortillas taste homemade. The dinner portion is big enough to share. The servers are friendly and attentive. But, the ice tea comes from the soda fountain and the chips taste like they come from a stale bag. The guacamole side was $5.95 for a small cup size bowl. The carne asada plate is $17.95. I think both are very expensive."}
{"text":"One of the best places for Mexican food. Place can be very busy especially on the weekends. Place is nice and decorated with typical south-of-the-Border items. staff was friendly. Service was good. The food is great, my favorite is till the rib eye with cilantro... perfectly cooked medium rare. Had the flan for dessert and it was delicious. Portions were big and can be shared. The menu is extensive with meat, chicken, seafood dishes. There is also a full bar. I consider their prices reasonable and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Wow. This place was great! We recently had our sons graduation dinner here. There was 15 of us and we called ahead for a reservation. They had our table ready when we got there and the ambiance was great. I ordered the don't Francisco. It was one enchilada with a piece of flank steak for around $18. It was solo good. The meat was so soft and cooked perfectly. At the end they all came around and put a huge sombrero on my son and dang to him. It was awesome. We are definitely going back here. Can't wait."}
{"text":"My last review of Lindo Michoacan (say that 5 times fast) was 7 years ago and it wasn't very good.  In the last few years I've changed my view on LM. Here's what I've learned. If you're looking for traditional Mexican food, enchiladas, tacos, rice, beans, then there are way better options in Vegas (Chapalas on Trop/Pecos). However, their specialty items are very good here. One item in particular keeps me coming back, the Pollo con Rajas y Crema. American for Chicken with sauteed peppers, onions, and topped with a really awesome cream sauce.  So that's what I've learned, their specialty items are actually really good. Their traditional stuff, schmeh.   The prices here are still out of sorts (for Mexican food) in my opinion. $15+ for most entrees. However, if you can make it for their lunch specials then you can cut your bill by a good 30-35% while getting the same exact food. Also, they make all of their tortillas in house, so no matter what you order make sure to get a few of these to accompany your meal.  Chips always come with salsa and beans. Not a fan of their salsa, but their beans are good for dipping purposes. Their table side guacamole is also pretty tasty as well.   The Pollo con Rajas y Crema is where it's at for me though. Thin chicken breast, it's almost always cooked to perfection, not tough. The onions and peppers are never too crunchy, which is a pet peeve of mine, cook those little flavor sensations up! You always get a dollop of guac to go with it. Honestly, I almost never eat the rice & beans that accompany the entree because I'm just not a fan of them. Plus, by the time the meal comes I've usually eaten 635 chips.  Service here is usually pretty reliable. Drink & chip refills usually don't have to be prompted, they are very proactive.  The view at this location makes the whole experience worthwhile. One of the best views in the valley if you get a table next to the window. Also, they usually have live music which is fun."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fresh guacamole is amazing. We got the beef flautas, cheese quesadilla and chili relleno. The salsa and bean dip are amazing. The staff is always super friendly and your water is never empty."}
{"text":"Prices kind of high service sucked i ordered steak fajitas i got 2 flour tortillas some guacamole and sour cream no cheese salsa is horrible i have visited 2 different locations wont be going to any other no time soon"}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is delicious and authentic. The atmosphere is relaxing and fun. The service is great with friendly and nice staff."}
{"text":"Wow! Class act!  Excellent margaritas on the rock!  Great food! Buey al Cilantro, C√°rnitas plate, camarones al mojo de ajo, and carnitas en chile verde, delicioso, beautiful restaurant and incredible view of Las Vegas, very friendly and timely service although they had a full house, we did not take any pictures, come and experience it!! Donald Trump, you are welcome too."}
{"text":"We have friends who come into town irregularly, but we always go here for lunch. Even with the pouring-down rain, the view was impressive. Their lunch menu is extensive and cost-saving.  The food is NOT the typical Mexican food; they specialize in food from other areas, rather than just the Tex-Cali-Mex dishes. Two of us had tongue with peppers and onions (Lengua a Michoacan)), a default meal for both, a third had a creamy chicken (Pollo con Rajas Y Crema) entree, and I had shrimp in a spicy sauce (Camarones Serandeados). The good was excellent, as usual. Even with the downsized lunch portions, we took some good home.  The service was mostly good, with our drinks being refilled repeatedly.  When it came time for dessert, we asked about a flaming dish we'd seen at another table; they said it was fried ice cream. We ordered one to share. At this point, the service slacked off a bit, with us having to ask for spoons and plates.  Behind the bar (which as also has the view) there are a multitude of empty bottles of tequila/mezcal, artfully arranged.  I highly recommend this restaurant if you are in the southeastern part of the valley. The views are wonderful, especially at sunset, the lunch specials are good until 5pm, and the food is deliciously unexpected."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas.  I love that they serve chips and salsa with a separate bowl of retried beans for dipping.  I have never seen that before.  The combo plates are delicious.  I enjoyed the tacos and the enchiladas a great deal.  Didn't do dessert, but everything looked good.  This is not a restaurant for tourists.  It is not convenient to The Strip or Downtown.  This is a locals joint with a following.  Go here of you are serious about Mexican food.  You will love it!"}
{"text":"This is probably my FAVORITE Mexican Restaurant in Las Vegas. They're good is delicious and they get your orders out quick.  Every time I come here i always order their fresh table side guacamole (now this is authentic guac). My favorite dish here is enchiladas de mole. Depending on my mood I will get the Coca Cola carnitas. They are delish!   Once you have ordered they always start you off with sopa de fideo which is very delicious! There's always enough chips, salsa and bean dip which is a huge plus!  Lastly, my favorite dessert is the fried ice cream, it's a must if you have room lol"}
{"text":"This is a great place! My only disappointment was they do not have queso dip. The food is pretty good but not #1 in my opinion. It is still a great place to meet with your friends, and the staff is hospitable and wonderful! They have a mariachi band on the weekends it's fun!"}
{"text":"Exceptional family run restaurant with out of this world service, excellent taste and quality, good drinks, LARGE menu selection! The shrimp was really tasty and fresh, table side guacamole is a must, chips are fresh and you get warm bean dip work the chips and salsa. They have a HOR sauce that has really good flavor with a bite at the end. Pride per plate was good for the amount of food too get!   A MUST try for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good!! The fideo soup is different and fun for a starter. Plus it's free gotta love that!"}
{"text":"If u like to be entertained this would be good place to go. service was good, but food was not much better than Roberto's tacos, I thought it was overpriced based on quality and taste. Salsa was a bit spicy for me but nothing unique about it. I ordered a strawberry margarita that tasted like daqurri . I did like the homemade flour tortilla tho."}
{"text":"I love the food here! I always order the carne asado burrito in a bowl (no tortilla) because I eat low carb. It's always a ton of food and really good! Our service is usually really good too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good service and authentic mexican food, we really loved it. They have an amazing view to the strip."}
{"text":"My husband I were visiting Las Vegas and were very surprised at the very authentic and sumptuous Mexican food prepared at the Original Lindo Michoacan.  The Mojarra Al Estilo Puerto Nuevo was very tasty, meaty and properly cooked.  The A La Carte Chile Relleno was delicious.  It was a Pasilla Chile battered in egg, filled with cheese and had like a chile- or tomatoe-based sauce.  The Chile Relleno was bit small however it's authentic taste more than made up for this.   The Taquitos Dorados (appetizer) were made from thin, white corn tortillas fried to until golden and crispy, were cut in half and topped with letttuce, avocado, cheese and pico de gallo (white onions, chile and tomatoes) and were arranged into a beautiful and colorful platter.   The freshly hand-made corn and flour tortillas were delectable.  The corn tortillas were made of white corn (not yellow-colored).   The Sopa de Fideo was made from real chicken broth and tomatoe sauce - absolutely tasty even in 110 degree weather.   I know what authentic Mexican food tastes like. This came very close to my own cooking as well as my aunt's. The cost was very reasonable ($35).   The Servers and all the staff were very courteous and attentive.  The restaurant was aesthetically pleasing and had a pleasant atmosphere.  The restaurant and bathrooms were very clean.  Go to the Original Lindo Michoacan! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Omg you have to go here. Families were there having a great time. Food was authentic. The decor is t e best. Many dips to enjoy."}
{"text":"The worst gringo'd out Mexican joint. The rice & beans were probably their best thing on the menu... usually I would turn back the food I didn't like for something else but gave up after eating a bite from the rest of my friends dishes. Also smelled like rotting fish + bleach? How they manage to pay their rent is what really boggles my mind.   Their only saving grace is the quality of customer service. Poor things can't be held liable for this venue's overrated kitchen staff based on the original Lindo Michoacan."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this place, excellent margaritas and very well priced lunch specials with soup included. We cant wait to go back, and did I mention the fabulous view? Go there, its great."}
{"text":"This place does Mexican food like no other! Authentic, fresh and bursting with flavor. The chips, salsa and bean dip almost fully satisfy me but I'm glad it doesn't stop there! The sopa de fideo that comes out before your meal is TO DIE FOR! The soup alone is the #1 reason I return again and again. As for entrees, you just can't go wrong! I usually get something different each time, knowing full well I will be happy with whatever I order. The waiters and waitresses are so attentive and if that were not enough, multiple people will check on you throughout your meal and ensure your eating space is sufficient for ultimate enjoyment.  I've been coming here since I was in middle school and I'm sure I'll be coming here when I, myself, have children in middle school! Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night around 7:30 and the place was jam packed. Luckily we managed to snag a couple seats at the bar.   I had the Don Francisco which was a steak served with tortillas, rice and beans and a small scoop of guacamole. It was nothing to write home about. The steak was quite tough, but most steaks at mexican places usually are. The rice and beans were standard fare. The tortillas were fresh and very tasty. Most dinner specials come with a small cup of soup which was pretty yummy. It was a tomato based broth with vermicelli. Strange but tasty.  I had a regular margarita and a top shelf margarita and couldn't really tell the difference between the two. My friend had several beers and they ended up comp'ing our drinks because we both played video poker. Pretty cool!  The restaurant itsself was very loud because it was so busy, but the mariachi band was entertaining. The view of the city was awesome.  Overall a decent place - definitely not the best I've had, but a fun atmosphere nonetheless."}
{"text":"Not that impressed with the food and it's really loud.  We had a reservation for a large party and still waited 45min."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food.  So many dishes to choose from. I will definitely come back when I visit Vegas again. Two thumbs up. Service is great too."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Las Vegas, it's a must. Never disappoints with the food. Love this place. Located in Henderson about a 15/20 minute drive from the strip. Ask for a table with the View."}
{"text":"This Mexican restaurant is my favorite new restaurant and I will be attending once or maybe twice a month the service was great the music was loud and awesome and the food was just out of this world I will recommend this place to anybody who wants  home cook Mexican food but in a restaurant setting."}
{"text":"I like that this place offers salsa, chips and beans to start. The view is great and their menu has a wide variety!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots for Mexican food.  The service is always excellent and speedy.  This location has a great view of the strip too if your into that sort of thing (just kidding, I'm not heartless)  They usually have some kind of live music or performers playing during the evening so just be prepared for the noise factor.  There may be a wait but it moves pretty fast and it's worth it!  We miss Tex-Mex flavors and now that we've found Lindo we have a place to cure the hankerin!"}
{"text":"Good find! I went here with a big group of colleagues (around 45 people), after a sales meeting at a convention. They struggled with the large group, but I'm sure that table service is fine when it's  just a couple of people or a family at a table.   For folks used to Mexican food, this place has a great menu. You'll see most of the usual favorites and they start you off with chips and a fiery salsa. Most meals came with a simple Fideo soup, which was really nice. Our group had tableside guacamole, which was good, but maybe had too much tomato.   The menu has a bunch of Michoacan food, which is amazing. It's divided up by beef, chicken, seafood, and pork, with traditional Mexican stuff, too.  I had ranchero-style Octopus, which was in an amazing sauce. The rice and beans were awesome. I also tasted another diner's Mole Poblano, which is easily the best mole that I've ever had.   I had a \"Javier's\" margarita, which was top-notch. A bunch of folks had margaritas or daiquiris. They must have two hundred tequilas at the bar.   We finished with their great Churros. Everyone loved it!"}
{"text":"We visited this location on a very busy Sunday-Mother's Day 2013. It coincidentally was my son's 13th birthday, and he chose the restaurant (good choice, son).  We walked in, expecting a crowd because it was prime lunch time on the most sacred of days for Mothers.  Our wait was about 25 minutes. We lucked out were able to sit in the waiting area (some had to stand, as they were busy).  We were greeted to be seated, and each female that the staff assumed was a Mother, was given a pretty carnation flower, a nice Mother's Day touch. They were hesitant on giving me one (hopefully because I looked too young to birth the 3 monsters in tow), but once they read my tank top that says 'Best Mom Ever', I was gifted a carnation.  We were brought to our table, which had gorgeous views of the Vegas strip. The decor is pretty authentic, and the live Mariachi band made me feel like I was back in Cancun on vacation. Unlimited chips, beans and salsa. I had the most delicious Pina Colada that by the time we had ordered our food, I was feeling VERY good. My 3 kids were also enjoying the live band, who were walking around from table to table.  Service was a bit slow, the wait to receive our food was a little longer than desired, but all was alright because the band, the non stop chips, and my amazing pina coladas made our experience actually FUN. The kiddos were rockin' out and didn't ask me once when their food was going to arrive (thats a first!).  We finished our meal, and were suddenly bombarded (in a good way) by the whole Mariachi band at our table, armed with churros loaded with whipped cream, and a huge sombrero, for my birthday boy to wear. The whole restaurant joined in to sing Happy Birthday.   It was truly a perfect day, thanks to delicious food and drink, great service, great experience, and sharing my special day with my firstborn."}
{"text":"Talk about authentic, this place is the real deal! Amazing food that was fresh, authentic, flavorful and rich. Awesome atmosphere with live music on weekends and the uniforms are great and make you feell like you're in mexico! The fountain in the back is really nice! The staff was attentive, very polite and FAST! My drink was never empty and thats saying a lot because I drank like 10 glasses of iced tea. (WALTER MY WAITER DESERVES A RAISE!) The food was such a great value. LOVE THE FREE CHIPS, SALSA AND FREIOS!  There is obviously a reason this place is on the best of las vegas. I give it a 10 out of 10 in basically every category.   Service 10 Ambiance 10 Fun factor 10 Cleanliness 10 Value 10 Taste 10 Temperature 10  Menue options 10"}
{"text":"This place had the most horrible service , messed up three of our orders, took literally 55 min to bring out a plate. One of plates apparently was not submitted and three different waiters had to ask what the plate was. The most simplest little things made our experience horrible. Sad for a place that has high ratings."}
{"text":"This authentic restaurant feels like it could easily be in Los Angeles and not in the burbs of Henderson.  Its perch amongst the expanse of the desert gives diners the opportunity to enjoy a great view of the Las Vegas skyline; I recommend going to see the sunset colors.  Upon sitting down, you can readily enjoy a generous bowl of tortilla chips accompanied by refried beans and hot sauce. I'm not a fan of spicy, so I probably scooped a generous amount of beans alone. It's just ok; the chips aren't the freshest or the thinnest. Beans would be best served with some fresh queso fresco on top. Sadly, I think I may have scooped a part of the bowl that had a small hair! Forgivable but still eek.  Portions are large and hearty. All our dishes came with a starter of fideo soup (tomato-based broth with thin 1-inch Lipton-like noodles) and sides of Spanish rice and refried beans doused with melted cheese.  I got the chile relleno with shrimp, but I thought the pepper would be covered in the typical eggy batter. Sadly, it was not, and the pepper itself was more spicy than usual. As someone who can't handle spicy, it was a bit much. The shrimp was good though. I ended up getting a side of their 'regular' chile relleno which had the perfectly fried egg batter shell, and the pepper was softer (lighter green) and less spicy because it had been baked with the batter. My friend got the chile verde burrito with pork which came with generous pork chunks; sauce was delicious.  Another friend got the #10 combo which came with a beef tamale and a beef enchilada - also solid.  The ambiance is festive as they have a small band playing lively music. Acoustics yield a bit of a din, and many large parties are celebrating birthdays. The service crew will come around and sing a loud rendition of Happy Birthday while the celebrant wears a large sombrero. You can also play slots or electronic poker at the bar.  The parking lot can get crowded when they're busy, but you can easily find parking on the street."}
{"text":"The place is jam packed at lunch and the noise level is deafening.  Have met friends at this restaurant twice in the past two months and they seated us in the smallest, most uncomfortable booth next to two very large groups.  We could not hear ourselves talk.  And to make matters worse, I have a medical condition where my voice is hoarse and the waiter got upset with me because he could not hear me.  He was very rude anyway.  He screwed up my order, but since he never came over to see how things were, I ate it anyway.  Also, my friend ordered a soda, which he never brought.  We will be looking for a new place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food, way off the strip (which is a great thing)!  Inside this place has a very authentic look and feel. While In vegas for work, a few of us decided to take a detour on the way to the airport for some Mexican.   The warm bean dip and smokey salsa served with the chips was really great!  The tableside guacamole was also exceptional, although I like mine with a little less onions and more lime.   For our entrees, we ordered street tacos, chicken enchilada and fajita burritos. All were well made with quality ingredients and came out hot and fresh.   I would definitely eat here again if I was visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"I would suggest making a reservation. My husband and I went here on a Friday night and the wait was long. But luckily, we got ourselves some margaritas which made the wait tolerable. It is pretty loud because there was a band playing and it was just crowded. We did get lucky though and sat in the area with a nice view, which was less noisy. I tried the jalape√±o margarita. It was ok. It wasn't the best. If they used jalape√±o-infused tequila and put some spicy salt on the rim, it would be heaven. Their table side guac is fresh and delish. We ordered a shrimp ranchero and shrimp with tequila sauce (or something like that). It wasn't that great. The fried ice cream was really good, though. We'll probably come back again and try something else."}
{"text":"As we first walk in, the decor is just stunning. The wood carvings are amazing and the restaurant is very flowy! As were seated, they bring fresh chips, salsa and refried beans.  The menus came along shortly after and we were approached with great customer service by our Server. He asked us what we wanted to drink. I ordered the horchatta for me and my other half and my cousin had a refreshing watermelon blended margarita w patron. So delicious!   I ordered a cheese enchilada and fresh guacamole was made and presented table side. How lovely! I also ordered two soft tacos! Delicious! I can't wait to visit Las Vegas again just to dine at this restaurant again soon!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is still in business.  When we first walked in the smell of sewage and rancid grease hit us.  We almost turned around and left but we were there already and Hungary.  Once seated, it took almost a half hour to get our drink orders in and another 15 minutes to actually get our drinks.  Chips, salsa and soupy cold refried beans came with our drinks.  Salsa was almost carbonated and tasted old and the chips were stale.  A half hour later our entree's were brought.  All 8 of us agreed that the food was bland and without flavor and the quality was dismal. Chicken was dry and hard and the steak tacos were mostly fat.  We quickly paid our bill, leaving the uneaten food and went to another restaurant for a decent meal.  If I could leave a negative 10 I would.  Next time in Lad Vegas we will choose our dining options more carefully."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, and I just find the place to be the most over hyped restaurant in Vegas. I enjoy Mexican food, but every dish I've had here lacks flavor. I believe that they might always be so busy that food is just bring pushed out as quickly as possible that the authenticity has diminished. Just my thoughts."}
{"text":"A dozen or more visits in the last year. I would not go with the \"chef\" suggestions on the menu. The steak & lobster tail wasn't even ok. They haven't proven to me the skill to do anything other than shrimp. The steak was not great either. The carne asada meat used is far better seasoned & cooked than the slab served. I should've known better to order this item in a Mexican restaurant unless the head chef may have been working. We go mostly at lunch time. Sticking with tacos and burritos, table side guacamole, margaritas and it's solid 4 stars. One bad experience doesn't make for a one star review. Don't get adventurous with the menu & stick to the favorites & you shouldn't be dissatisfied. True story"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch. The are 36 different lunch specials! Went here with some colleagues from work and they quickly brought us chips, salsa and bean dip (bottomless... some places charge for bean dip).  For our lunch specials we chose the fish tacos, chimichanga and the beef burrito. All came out quickly and were served with plenty of beans, rice and lettuce / tomatoes. Delicious and under $10!  Worth a visit if you like Hispanic food, plenty of options for everyone. Suckers on the way out."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, love the live music here. We sat at the bar. Food was ok. I grew up in Colorado so I def miss the Mexican food there. Nothing like it out here in lv."}
{"text":"Muy delicioso! This place has amazing Mexican food. It's so good that I'm writing this from my table after just finishing dinner here. There are pages and pages of specialties that you don't normally find in a typical Mexican restaurant in the US. I highly recommend the Mole Poblano, which is thinly grilled chicken breasts covered in a delicious brown mole sauce. It is hands down the best chicken mole I've ever had. It has a bit of heat but not too much. It is served with fresh, made in house flour tortillas. Most meals are served with fideo soup (noodles in a tomato broth), which my wife stated was very close to the one her Mexican grandmother used to make. The atmosphere is festive with live music and Mexican art, objects and wares as decor. A short drive from the strip, it's definitely worth the effort if you have use of a car, as we did. I found this restaurant on a USAToday.com city guide which mentioned that of the four locations in the area, this one on Desert Inn is best.  Note: I originally wrote this review on Jan 3, 2010 and posted it on TripAdvisor at the time."}
{"text":"19/100 Yelp 100 2016.  Went to Lindo Michoacan last night after realizing that many local restaurants were closed early. My best friend had talked about this restaurant before when I visited her in Vegas and had always sung its praises!   The heavy front door lends to its authenticity of decor. Inside its walls and ceiling are plastered with tastefully placed artwork, beautiful mosaic sconces and hanging lamps that popped with color and added so much charm to this place! We were quickly greeted by our server and drinks were rapidly on their way! My friend got a strawberry daiquiri and I got a coconut margarita (always rocks!). Super delicious and STRONG! Yum!   Chips and salsa are served with bean dip that is so packed with flavor! The salsa reminded me of a chili red sauce, almost what they would drizzle over an enchilada or wet burrito. It doesn't have the small chunks of tomato or onion that you might expect. Could have had some more heat, but still delicious!   I ordered the Morelia (#1 combo plate): chicken enchilada, carne asada taco (crispy shell) and chile relleno... These come with refried beans topped with cheese and Spanish rice.   The chile relleno was my favorite! Large poblano chile stuffed with melty cheese and basted in that familiar egg white \"merengue\" mixture and dipped in... Hey! I think it's the red sauce! Damn that sauce is good! The rice was a bit on the salty side so I only took a few bites, but everything else was drool worthy amazing!   My bestie and I capped off our gastronomical Mexican experience with their homemade flan. Each bite was creamy, caramel-ey and \"sweet-film-on-the-roof-of-your-mouth\" amazing. With drinks, entrees and dessert, we spent about $30 each.   I'll be coming back here with bestie EVERY time I visit her. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We came at lunch. Wasn't to busy. Sat next to the window that over looks Las Vegas. Beautiful day, so we were able to enjoy the view. The service was top notch. Drinks never got below half a glass.   The chips are everything you would expect. Delicious fresh and served with beans and salsa. Both of which were excellent.   I ordered the carne Assad tacos. They don't mess around. Tons of meat. The rice and beans were on point and the guacamole was great.   She ordered the pollo e creama (number 16 on the specials menu.) Man bat was seriously amazing. I should have ordered that as well!!  All in all a great experience. Great staff that were polite, great view, excellent food and amazing service. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Best service , great atmosphere, delicious food so if ur in vegas and want Mexican food this place is a must ..im blown away by far the best Mexican restaurant I have ever been to"}
{"text":"Hands down best Mexican food I have found in this city. Go! Great ambiance, great fun. Can't recommend it enough!"}
{"text":"Don't you hate when people hype up a place so much that when you finally go it isn't what you expect.  The service was excellent and the salsa and bean dip was delicious but i expected better when it came to my enchiladas.  I normally get my enchiladas elsewhere and they are fantastic and the same price as here, the hype was built up so great so i wws expecting better i guess.   i would recommend people to try this place to make their own decision. I'm not big on mexican food so it may be me but I'll be going back to my other place for my enchilada fix."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Vegas, a first-generation Mexican-American. I've been coming here or many years. They've just introduced a saturday-Sunday brunch with champagne and Margaritas( if that's your thing). Great buffet, including birria and menudo. Worth ever penny, from a Vegas native."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, it is a great experience. Delicious food, great customer service, and authentic decor. Highly recommend when you visit Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"The view is amazing and definitely the highlight.  The food was ok, not what I was expecting. Some things were great others were subpar. The service from our waiter was horrendous. The attendants were great, but the server never checked on us, no refills, never came back to the table except to drop off the bill.   The chips that came out were decent, they lacked salt. The salsa was good, especially when mixed with the bean dip. My mojito was just bad.   I had carne a la tampequeno, a favorite of mine based on time spent in Mexico. The version at Lindo is okay, but the meat was not what I would have expected.  The rice an beans were the same thing I would expect from a hole in wall. Not bad, but nothing special.   Our table was seated with a prime view.  The servers assistants were always around, and the table stayed clean. But no one offered anyone a fresh drink, or checked on the food. Sad really.   Maybe we will go back. But it won't break my heart if we don't."}
{"text":"What do you people see in this place???  The food is horrible.  The chips are greasy and soggy.  The red \"salsa\" (And I use that word lightly) tastes like burnt peppers . . . .This is the WORST salsa I have ever had.  Then the soup that comes with the meals . . .what the hell is that?  It is terrible.  The people who had been there before in our party basically screamed a loud \"NO\" when the put that soup down in front of them . . . and told them to take it away.  The chicken burrito I had lacked flavor . . . it was not marinated or seasoned at all.  It was like they just threw chicken in a tortilla and called it a day.  Three of us in our party all had this and all agreed that it was the worst burrito EVER and that Del Taco makes batter food.  One person found chicken bones and grissle in her burrito . . . she currently has an upset stomach and will most likely throw up.  This place should be shut down it is that bad . . . yet there is a huge wait each night to get gross food . . . I just don't get it.  The only thing that is nice about the place is the view . . .but that is spoiled by how loud this place is . . . you can't hear the person next to you.  So come on people . . . ..take your business elsewhere . . .this place frankly offers some of the worst Mexican food I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Decided on something different for lunch, so Mexican food it was.  I had a shrimp chimichanga.  It was very flavorful....I enjoyed my lunch.  Prices are a little high here, but we'll worth it"}
{"text":"Service like this isn't matched anywhere else no matter what you're paying. Food is always hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food not great. Very friendly staff and nice atmosphere. Chips and Salsa tasty. Get a margarita and all is good!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is yummy. I always order the shrimp tacos. I've never tried a fish or shrimp taco before because it did not sound appealing but they are very good here. I also love this place because they have the very spicy habanero salsa. If I am ever craving spicy food, this is the Mexican restaurant I go to. And you can't beat the view of the city."}
{"text":"Qu√© magn√≠fico! I can't get enough of delicious Mexican cuisine...especially in the Southwest.   Make a reservation to guarantee a table or take your chance in the city of Lady Luck...either way, eat here. You'll be greeted by happy employees that aim to please.  The food comes out freshly made and with speed. They move parties in and out as quickly as the customers want. We didn't feel rushed and we got constant attention to make sure all was well.  They had a mariachi band on a Friday night. The place was packed and large parties gathered around. They easily accommodate your group and set up long tables so everyone can dine together.  They serve chips and salsa and bean dip to start. While everything on the menu sounded tasty, I ordered the veggie enchiladas. The vegetables were diced and fresh. The side of beans and rice were great. I wanted to eat everything on my plate, but my stomach was telling me there was no more room. The portions were large.  I wish all restaurants were run this way. Excellent, hearts to serve, food to nourish and enjoy, and it made for a great beginning to a Vegas Friday night."}
{"text":"They have fast friendly service. The food is always so good and cooked fresh to order. It's a little loud but the view of the strip makes up for the noise. Love the salsa and bean dip."}
{"text":"For a lifeling Vegas resident (ok, ok, Henderson) it sure took me a long time to get to Lindo Michoacan, and by the time I went it was all the rage.  While I didn't think it was everything it was pumped up to be, it was still very good.  Their chips and salsa (truly the measure of any Mexican or Tex-Mex place) are dynomite.  Their entrees are big and tasty, and the margaritas are also big and tasty.  Service is always quick and friendly and the atmosphere is comfortable.  There's nothing truly OUTSTANDING about Lindo, but it's good food that's consistently good with service you can count on.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"We live very close to this place, and since it's always so busy inside, we usually get TO GO.  Their frijoles refritos are the bom-B.  Everyone inside is so kind, always smiling and always pleasant and efficient.  Now I'm craving the food!!  Don't just drive by them...next time, see for yourself."}
{"text":"The best place in the Southwest for authentic Mexican food at reasonable prices and the view of the city is absolutely spectacular. The service is prompt, friendly, and attentive and the food is superb. Try their mole' chicken....to die for!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants! Their carne asada is my favorite. Always a good time at Lindo!"}
{"text":"Food and service was great! Had #1 combo and couldn't finish it. The delicious chips, beans, salsa and cup of fidello soup prior to our meal helped fill us up. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Besides really good Mexican food, this restaurant has the best view!!!  Met up with another couple at the bar which has a window overlooking the entire Las Vegas Valley!  Incredible!  Drank a few \"skinny margaritas\" and had some of the best appetizers ever!   The jalape√±o cheese stuffed peppers with the most amazing freshly made tortillas is the way to start the feast!   Slice a bit of the jalape√±o and wrap in a nice warm tortilla with a little sour cream, nothing but a bit of heaven!   Of course we added the table side guacamole, fresh is best!   I also had the chille rellano, I like it a lot!   My husband had fajitas and he was very satisfied.  We ended the night at the bar just hanging out and enjoying the incredible view!  I can see this place hosting a first date, and date, hanging with friends, and celebrations!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Good food, excellent crowd and fast service.  While we were there the air conditioning failed.  The outside air temp was 113 degrees.  Management realized the inconvenience to their customers as it was a packed house and brought a free round of drinks to our table.  I asked if they did this for everyone and the manager said that they did - Good on them!  Stuff happens but they worked through it and got the A/C back up and running within the hour.  P.S. Their Ensalada Marinera made in an avocado shell with shrimp was to die for!!!"}
{"text":"A must when my friends are in town. Despite this location being farther from me than the others, the food in my opinion is much better. Service is always great. Restaurant is high energy and always packed."}
{"text":"Three of us had dinner here Friday July 11, 2014.  We had a reservation and after having read several reviews mentioning the great view we asked for a table with the view.  It was spectacular.  We were seated immediately and chips, salsa and bean dip arrived immediately.  All were good.  I prefer a lighter a chip - but these were fine.  I prefer a less hot salsa but this was fine.  Truthfully, I love all chips and salsa so it's not possible to disappoint me here.  Normally I order a cheese dip / queso but didn't get around to it this time so I can't give an opinion.  We requested the quacamole be made table side as I had seen mentioned on other Yelp reviews.  It was delicious.  I would never not order it at this restaurant.  One comment I'll make is I've had other tableside guac before and they have fresh garlic which I really love.  I would love it if Lindo Michoacan added garlic as an option with their guac.  But again, it was awesome as served.  I had cheese chile rellenos with rice and beans and my companions shared a pork carnitos dish.  We were all pleased.  I had two margaritas with Grand Marnier.  While pricey they were excellent.  Their service is excellent and attentive.  There was no delay in any part of the dinner.  I noticed tables being seated, served and cleared with speed.  As for the comments about the noise - we had no problem carrying on our conversations.  Granted, we were seated behind the band.  It seems as though the band plays a couple of songs and breaks so it's not a constant thing.  I think they handle the balance of the sound of the large open room, with sporadic band playing and enjoying dinner and conversation very well."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and very loud which is perfect for hosting a large group because you don't have to worry about being too loud. There was live music which was pretty cool. The free appetizer chips come with salsa and bean dip. The salsa had a little bit of an odd flavor and the chips were very bland, but the bean dip was pretty good when it was warm. They also gave us a soup before our meals arrived that was good but I didn't want to fill up before my main food got to the table. I ordered three shrimp tacos for my main course and they were ok. They were lacking in the flavor department and the pieces of shrimp were pretty small. The good thing was that the food was very filling and the portions were pretty big so I didn't leave hungry. I'm not sure if I would choose this place over other Mexican restaurants close by next time I decided to dine out though."}
{"text":"Pro- service was prompt Con- food was not my favorite. I really wanted to like this place. I read reviews and was ready to be wowed. The food was bland."}
{"text":"I love Lindo's! The tortilla chips are freshly made and continually refilled alongside fresh salsa and refried beans. I would highly recommend the fresh guacamole, made tableside. It never disappoints. Chefs specials are all really good. I like to order the fajitas or the taquitos. If you leave room for dessert, go for the fried ice cream!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this restaurant! I wish I could give them 10 stars. Always the first place I go to when I visit Vegas. The food is amazing, the staff is extremely friendly, the interior is great, not to mention the incredible drinks -even the lollipops by the front door are yummy. lol I wish they would open more locations in other states."}
{"text":"Expecting great. Got okay.  Salsa very good. Cadillac margarita amazing.  Enchiladas Suizas??? Chicken  has texture of a deli/canned meat. Little flavor.Salsa Verde bland. I won't go back but it was reasonably priced and decent service."}
{"text":"The best authentic Mexican restaurant I have ever been to and experienced! Went there two nights in a row during our weekend stay in Las Vegas. The Camar√≥nes del Diablo and the Chilis Rellenos were amazing and very filling! If you come hungry you will leave very happy!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great service was even better!!! We had a really fun time on my parents 50th wedding!"}
{"text":"It was fine.  Food was fine, atmosphere was fine, service was fine.  For me, It was as spectacular as everyone's reviews made it sounds."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. I'm from LA and I'm Mexican and this place is my family's favorite for authentic Mexican food. Their fideo is the best I've ever had and their margaritas are delicious. The staff is super friendly and I have never seen waiters and bus boys work harder at any other place. These guys are running around and stay on top of everything and they do it with a smile on their face. If you come for your birthday they will sing and give you a tequila shot. Definitely a louder place but super casual and a lot of fun. Food is super authentic, the tortillas are hand made! If you love Mexican food, you have to visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! the food is delicious and the margaritas are even better! I always get strawberry or mango! they both are always perfect for my taste. and the environment is super fun to look around in."}
{"text":"My aunt is a local and brought us here for dinner.  We had an awesome experience!!  They give you beans, salsa and chips to start and a cup of fideo!! Delish!! Next we ordered the shrimp burrito appetizer... It was more of a chimichanga but so good regardless!!! I could have stopped there and been satisfied but I still had my steak fajita burrito on its way!!  My burrito was good but could have done with more seasoning. My aunt had a carne Asada burrito with was seasoned perfectly and my husband and cousin had the carne asada. Their steaks were delicious.  After 2 bites of burrito and sampling everyone else's I was stuffed! But the waiter came over and said if we voted for them for some contest we would get a free dessert or margarita.  I wanted to try their fried ice cream so I said why not!  Here is why I only gave 4 stars...I do what the waiter told me to do and he tells me oh you can only get churros and it can go for my husband's margarita because it wasn't the regular one. At no time did he say there were restrictions. He made it seem as if it was any dessert so they could get my vote. I still got the fried ice cream for $6 and it was so good!!!! The free churros were also good."}
{"text":"Born and raised in So Cali....I've had my fair share of Mexican restaurants from Los Angeles all the way down to San Diego. Aside from having a fantastic date with my special someone, Lindo Michoacan did not satisfy my expectations.   My date enjoyed his margaritaS. He got two of them. So all you drinkers out there, drink up. This stuff is good. (So he said.)   Besides the complimentary chips and salsa + bean dip....we also ordered guacamole for an additional charge. The guac.... +1 star. They prepare it fresh right in front of you....with all the mixings of cilantro, onions, tomatoes and your choice of the level of spiciness.  Our entrees, both of us ordered the combination dishes; a beef tamale and one enchilada (choice of beef or cheese.) Combination dishes includes rice and beans. I opted for all rice please. My beef tamale was pretty bland....and my beef enchilada wasn't very good. Also, pet peeve of mine: I love my food pippin hot. They brought out my entree warm. Ehh.... =/ I just settled with it and ate my food. Although filling, it just left something to be desired.  To sum it up: +1 for the guacamole dip +1 for the great view of the city of Las Vegas that my date reserved for us. +1 for the waiter service.  Sadly...that's pretty much it. Just like how Olive Garden can be considered \"fake\" Italian and PF Changs is glorified Asian food. Well....Lindo Michoacan can be added to the \"fake\" Mexican food. Give me some hole in the wall Mexican restaurant instead."}
{"text":"Best Authentic Mexican food I ever had.  Atmosphere was amazing.  Staff were very nice and extremely helpful.  If you haven't been there yet, you must go for lunch or dinner.  This is the only Mexican Restaurant that I have been to here in the Las Vegas Valley that I will definitely go back to.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Mexican cuisine that I have ever tasted! The view of The Strip is pretty incredible also. The wait staff is very attentive and keep the drinks and chips full!!"}
{"text":"This place was lovely! I got a little too crazy the night before and needed some serious food to make me feel better. I had a yummy fish soup that tasted just like my moms back home. Boyfriend got the fajitas and we're also very delicious. Everything was very authentic and had a homey feel to it."}
{"text":"My fav mexican restaurant in Vegas. This service is very good, the servers are very attentive. from 2 to 5 Monday through Friday the happy hour is 2 for 1 margaritas and they have some of the best margaritas in town. Highly recommend the steak or chicken cognac. I always order the steak salad as well that never disappoints."}
{"text":"Love this place! Hands down has the best Mexican food I've tried in Vegas! Their service is amazing too! Salsa and guacamole are delicious and when it runs out because people can't stop eating it, they don't mind replenishing it! He only downfall is that they aren't close to my side of town but I don't mind traveling"}
{"text":"It's so unusual that anyone would say this is authentic Mexican food.  It was possible some of the least authentic I've had and I am able to compare after eating some of the best Mexican food at La Roca (in Mexico/on the border of Tucson and Nogales) and other places in California.  I prefer hole-in-the-walls over high-priced faux.  Ordered the enchilada and taco but before the entree, I thought the tri-colored chips (red and blue) tasted heavily of food coloring and the salsa was terrible.  But I am also biased because I like salsa fresca styles over the thick \"tomato sauce\" type that remind me of jar salsa.  When you order a taco, a true Mexican taco is not deep fried...but mine was.  This wasn't an issue, I only point it out that it's not \"real\" Mexican food and I would debate on how many people have truly had authentic Mexican food to compare.  The good part was the guacamole was fresh and tasted wonderful and I thought the wait staff was nice.   I won't go back again....overpriced and the food wasn't great."}
{"text":"Wanted some good Mexican food while in Vegas,  this place came highly recommended.  The atmosphere is vibrant,  the smells intoxicating,  and the food...  Divine!   Will keep this as a fave for next time."}
{"text":"pretty good service bro my server was Carlos he's the bomb so i will be back 100%plus the food was fire I'm a Mexican zacatecas n this right here made my day plus it's my birthda 31 say whhaat"}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance of the restaurant. We were there to celebrate two of my co-worker's birthdays and they made the happy birthday song fun with the sombreros and singing. I really liked the chips, salsa, and bean dip they put out. Had great flavor and you could tell the chips were fresh."}
{"text":"The quality of their food is fantastic.  I tried the mole poblano chicken which was sweet and spicy, with chocolate and green mole spices topped with sesame seeds.  They serve their homemade warm tortillas which are awesome.  I love their complimentary bean dip and salsa - it's so good you could make a meal of that.  Everyone in my group loved their food."}
{"text":"We went here over the weekend and I must say, they got my love again! There was about a 10 minute wait which is not bad on a Saturday night. While waiting we ordered margaritas, muy Bueno! Once seated we were in the front of the dining room with a great view of Las Vegas. I think LM has one of the better views of town.  As usual I ordered the Ensalada Marinara which was spot on, ripe avocados, plenty of shrimp and pico de gallo! The rest of the group ordered fish tacos, a very large portion. A burrito and quesadilla for the girls. All very tasty and excellent service.  If you have a craving for Mexican food with a view, this is the place."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why people rave about this place. The view is amazing but the food is not really that good. It's okay at best. I've eaten here several times, tried different things and still cannot find anything I like. Service can be good but last time I had to wait 20 minutes for my waiter to come back to the table to ask for more salad dressing."}
{"text":"Amazing views of the skyline of Vegas! This was an amazing Mexican restaurant from the decor to the ambiance to the food the only reason it's not a 5 star is because of some mediocre service. It was slow to start but ended up good at the end. I had the fajitas de Reyes which were amazing really good seasoned meat followed with the perfect amount of peppers onions and tomatoes. The rest of my party really enjoyed the food as well. The evenin was topped off with a mariachi band that was playing live music. This is not on the strip in fact no where near it and we wouldnt have know about it except for family that lives in lv. The fried ice cream was delicious and we all shared because the portions are very generous! Be ready to eat when you get there cuz from beginning to end it's all food!"}
{"text":"Great food and better service . Everyone very cheerful and helpful. Live singers too on the weekends"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I'm a huge fan of guacamole and I must say that this place knows what's up.  You can order it to be made fresh at the table and it's always delicious! I hate onions so the option to order fresh is a really big deal for me. I switch up my food options here and I've never been disappointed. If you love to drink, and lets be honest- who doesn't (besides my mother- hi mom), order a bulldog. It's a margarita with a beer in it so basically my idea of heaven on earth. They also give you this soup before your meal and I'm obsessed with it. I have one more thing to add (while I have your attention) it's one of those restaurants where they give you a free shot on your birthday so it's literally someone's birthday there every 5 minutes which I think is pretty funny. They also have really great views if you request a seat by the window."}
{"text":"This place has a beautiful view of the strip and really tasty preparados/ michaladas!!!!!! Happy hour is awesome! If your looking for a good snack try the queso fondido or the sopitas!!!! Yum yum!!! I didn't like the main course as much but I would come back and try something again!!!! Great service and fun atmosphere! Love this place and its close to our house!!!!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I am in Las Vegas this a must stop. Food is incredible and the service is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Went for my bday. I called personally to ask for a seat with a view of Vegas. Needless to say they didnt have a seat with a view. However the manager sent us over a free dessert which was nice. The food was excellent. The prices a lil high but if you get there before 5 some great specials!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Unfortunately, I seem to get the carnitas every time I go now.  They are very well prepared and come with large home made flour tortillas that are awesome.  There are always leftovers for the next day's lunch.  We always get the table-side guacamole, which i would recommend regulating the amount of ingredients the servers mix in.  Some of the servers just dump a whole bowl of onion, one of tomatoes, and another of jalapenos into the mix.  It should just be a touch of each of those.  I sat outside on our last visit and it was very pleasant.  Inside is a little more typical, but still nice.   Food update:  I didn't like the Chile Verde as I found it too sour.  But I did have the Chile Relleno, and I recommend!  They use Pasilla Chiles (i'm purdy sure), and nice creamy cheese that mixes well with the enchilada sauce that its covered in.  The sauce is almost as good as mine! (almost.)    I generally disagree with the other comments about service.  I have generally had very good luck and received extremely friendly service."}
{"text":"After a long night of partying in Las Vegas we decided to go here to have a delicious breakfast. We have been here before many numerous times before while visiting Las Vegas one of our favorite Mexican restaurants to visit while in Las Vegas. When we arrived the ladies up in the front appear to be still sleepy or unmotivated to be at work.  They just left the sense of welcoming to their customers. When we got there it appears that they were going through some type of inspection by the big bosses. It would've been nice if the big bosses would've stop by our table and said hey thank you very much for dining with us we know there's thousands of other Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas but thank you for dining with us but that's OK. My wife had the Chilaquiles and I had the huevos divorciados .   Both dishes were just ok- they've been better in the past- our waiter was ok point!!! Very, very friendly and professional- the flour tortillas here are homemade and let me tell you, if you never had homemade flour tortillas, you are missing out!!!!  The atmosphere in this restaurant is gorgeous beautifully decorated very clean everybody dressed so professionally the bar is to die for it's gorgeous the bartender there she was so friendly very nice. Made you feel at home-"}
{"text":"I like this place. A little pricey at $20 for a carne asada plate, but the food was good, the waiter was prompt, and the atmosphere was pleasant. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great views and great atmosphere...if you want Mexican food it's worth the trip to the Henderson location with the best views for picture taking as you can see Las Vegas strip all lit up"}
{"text":"What an amazing place! Great location, great music and best of all Fantastic Great Food!!  The place is always packed, but you never have to wait long!  They start you out with homemade chips and salsa and get this..... beans!  I've never seen this before!  Then they serve a house soup which was AMAZING!  I had fajitas de Res and it was perfect!    The finishing touches was the Fried Ice Cream!  WOW, I really enjoyed it!    Finally the best place to sit is close to the large window, which over looks the valley and strip!   It's truly worth your time to eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit Las Vegas I cannot come back home (California) without going Lindo Michoac√°n and have dinner. I have been coming to this place for 9 years. One of the thing I like about this place is when they sit you down they bring the tortilla chips; they make their own, with salsa and refried beans to complement that try their Fresh Guacamole Dip. They prepare the dip in front of you.  Another thing I like is they bring you sopa de fideo (Noodle soup); they make their own, before they bring your main entr√©e. No other Mexican restaurant that I been to do that.  They also make flour or corn tortillas by hand. They have variety Mexican plates. The dishes have very good portion of food. They also have great desserts. When you come to this place read the history of Lindo Michoac√°n on their menu. Lindo Michoac√°n has interesting history. I highly recommended, check it out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! The food is my favorite. Waiter forgot my margarita but he was swamped so no hard feelings. :)"}
{"text":"It was our first time trying this restaurant. When we arrived the place was packed. People were lining up outside the restaurant. That says something about this place so we decided to go head and wait and praying the food is worth it. The view though is spectacular! The food is good. I don't usually eat beans but they served the chips with a side of salsa and beans and they were delicious. I ordered the shrimp fajitas and it was also delicious. My husband ordered a beef fajitas and the meat came out dry. Other than that, the rest of the food was good. The service was okay. I felt like we were being rushed maybe because the place was packed. Our waiter came occasionally to ask if everything was ok but everytime, before we answered he was already walking away. He didn't seem to care but at least we enjoyed our dinner. We might go back for lunch next time hoping it won't be too packed and get a better service and not so dry meat. Maybe then I'll give this place a 5 star."}
{"text":"In the past this was one of my favorite restaurants. Yesterday the food temperature was not hot and the enchiladas seemed not so fresh. The fried ice cream in the past as I remember was lit and when I asked the waiter he gave me some lame excuse. At Panchos in Downtown Summerlin they bid you farewell when you leave, here the host just sort of looks at you."}
{"text":"Best food experience/service in las Vegas thus far these ppl know how a restaurant is supposed to be run they take pride in there product it's a must go every time me and my family are in Vegas  good job I love this place."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a number of times and the service and food is amazing!  And love the view of las Vegas from the window seat!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in the Valley. Not super fancy, but that's what I like about it. They make locals comfortable and tourists as well. Try the chicken flautas with flour tortillas instead of corn, heaven! They have 3 locations. I've been to all of them, and I happen to prefer Henderson due to location, and I think the food is *slightly* better. But honestly, you can't go wrong at any of them."}
{"text":"Friendly Staff, Courteous Service.  Very tasty food clean atmosphere.  Definitely a must while visiting Vegas. Another great ammenity the restaurant provides free shuttle service to and from hotel. My first time at the restaurant great experience."}
{"text":"Have been here 2 times now and the food was very bland. The service was terrible. And to top it off I got food poisoning. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"My wife, son and I used to love coming here but today was horrible. I came here with my son and two of my friends. The waiter was rude, I asked for a small sauce of Habanero to go with my Chips and he rudely just said \"Someone will bring it out\". Asked on 2 other separate occasions still nothing just ignored. It was the Busser/Buss Boy who I asked that brought it over. Waiter was only seen 3 times. One to ask what we wanted to drink when we came in and to take drink order, second when dropping off the drinks and taking food order and last walking by quickly and asking if I wanted another Margarita. The Busser/Buss Boy practically served/waited on us.   Personally the food here is a hit or miss as my son did not like his Chicken, my food was ok nothing spectacular today but I have had better on different days, so I will not knock the food it is good.   But Customers or Patrons do NOT need to deal with rude Waiters or people going through shit in their lives, you are paid to wait on customers and as a reward you get a good tip for your service. Today the service was worth nothing but a waste of our time. Someone should promote the Busser/Buss Boy and Girls at this place and fire the Waiters because this is not a unique experience at this place but the norm it seems.  We all need to support local businesses that actually care for their customers in Las Vegas and my family does its best. Businesses need to do their best to put a smile on their customers faces and not leave them disgusted with service or lack thereof. I even had to call over the same Busser/Buss Boy to run my card as we were done and the rude Waiter was no where to be found still.  So take it from a long time customer, and I have to say I have had great experiences with many of the Bussers/Buss Girls and Guys there, always pleasant etc. Take my word for it, if your waiter would rather be somewhere else and does not get you what you asked for of disappears and is rude take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food is amazing. They have one of the best watermelon margaritas I have ever tasted. I like to order a different plate everytime I go and I have yet to be disappointed. Its has a great atmosphere any time of day you're there"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Lindo Michoacan for great tasting Mexican food. They start you off with on the house chips, salsa, beans and once you order you get a small bowl of their special Fideo soup which is delicious. Didn't even have to order an appetizer. Food portions are generous and each main dish will cost you around $15-$20. I had the steak/chicken fajitas which came out sizzling and served with rice, gauc, and beans on the side. Big plus is that they have Hand made tortillas made right at the restaurant. My wife had the carne asada plate which was really really good and huge portion. Good energy, they come out and sing and make a lot of noise for birthdays. Being Mexican myself, I definitely recommend this place for a good authentic dinner."}
{"text":"If you have a cold or are not feeling that well their 7 mares will bring you back to life!!! Their margaritas are bomb and food 2 but I'm telling u that 7 mares will revive you"}
{"text":"My wife and I needed something to bring to a friend's house for an appetizer. We had never been to Lindo Michoacan before and thought, \"we'll just quickly grab some chips, salsa, and guacamole to go.\" Boy were we wrong... I placed a take out order and the hostess said, no problem. The total came to $25 which is a little steep for chips, guacamole, and salsa, but the restaurant is close to where I live and we thought it would be a good crowd pleaser! After 30 minutes of waiting, I asked about my order. The hostess checks and says \"oh just a few more minutes.\" Another 10 minutes goes by, and still nothing. I ask again. She apologizes and goes to the kitchen to check on the order. She comes back and says, \"it'll just be a few minutes.\" At this point, I ask for a manager. When the manager comes out, I fill him in. Explain that I ordered chips, salsa and guacamole to go more than 40 minutes ago. He apologizes and goes to the kitchen to check on the order. When he returns, without my order, he says, \"It'll be about 5 more minutes.\" Are you kidding me? Since when does it take 45 minutes or longer to get a quick to-go order?! At that point, I tell him nevermind and I'd like a refund so I can be on my way. He says, \"You don't want to wait for your order?\" I almost laughed. Waiting is all I had been doing. And no, I was done waiting. He processed my refund, apologized, and I left. Needless to say, I will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is good. The service was great. Our food came out really really fast! If you can get a table by the window the view is cool, you can see the LV sky line! Best part was the Cadillac Margaritas they are strong. Not weak you can definitely taste the alcohol in it!! The food was good definitely worth checking out! Loud atmosphere good for kids and birthday dinners!!!"}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food in a nice atmosphere in a convenient location...definitely have better Mexican at Ricardo's!"}
{"text":"Love love this place. My friends and i went here on trip to vegas and everything was great. I ordered enchiladas de mole, ohhh so good. The only thing i didnt like was their horchata drink it taste so watered down like it was made from those powder pouches from the markets. Other than that the food was pretty good. My bf loved their micheladas it had like this little lemon kick to it. Good place to try."}
{"text":"This place is busy for lunch so be prepared. Love the bean dip and salsa to start. They make their own tortillas in house. Food is yummy and consistent. Drinks are well poured. Nice kids menu as well."}
{"text":"Great food but the service was horrible! Plus there is too much going on. It's extremely loud. Ringing cow bell, why?   And for the hostess, when a family comes in with small children it's best you don't sit them next to the speakers/dj singing booth!   The sitting is tight. So tight where I was sitting my chair got kicked or pushed by every waiter an waitress passing by. It was ridiculous."}
{"text":"This is definitelyis my favorite spot in Vegas! This is the first time I've been to the new location, omg, it is so impressive!  Still has great service, great food, great prices! My absolute favorite dish is \"camarones abuelito timo\". stuffed bacon wrapped prawns!"}
{"text":"We had friends recommend this restaurant to us (there are more than 1 but all the same) OMG was it wonderful!  Believe it or not, the HOUSE margarita was actually the BOMB...so figure it out from there.  I had this CRAZY chili relenno that was stuffed with shrimp, octopus, fish and I think scallops and then deep fried.  It looked like the BOMB and tasted like the BOMB!  Husband went safe...was very good but he should have listened to the waiter.  Great Place to come and off the strip!  YIPEE!"}
{"text":"I was taken here by my Mexican friend, who claims this is one of two authentic Mexican restaurants in all of Vegas.  It's got a great ambiance, a live musician playing the keyboard to Mexico's greatest hits (judging by my pal's enthusiasm for the songs), and delicious food.  At one point, some people even got up to dance the bachata - winner, winner, chicken dinner.  Pros: Delicious food \"Mexican approved\" (and I mean \"Mexican from Mexico City,\" not, \"this one friend I have who is kind of tan and I think his last name is Garcia or something.\") Well-decorated Good ambiance - great for groups or a romantic date - a rare combo! Friendly and prompt service The dude playing the keyboard had a good voice.  (If you have to listen to live music, it had better be pleasant, that's all I'm saying!)  Cons: A little spend-y for a Mexican restaurant - I usually think of Mexican as cheap eats. A little loud for first-date or similar chit-chat. No \"mild\" salsa option at the table - I'd say it was medium, which is cool for me, but might not be everyone's bag.  Or bowl.  Or container of your choice.   *A side note: The service was great, but they did forget to bring my side of guacamole, I forgot to mention the oversight, and when the bill came I forgot to check and see if I was charged for it - double fail on me!  Overall, this place is a win, and I will totally go again."}
{"text":"The awesome workers are one of the best I have ever met and the bratty kids get free soup. One complaint is that it was very slow to get my food and not a massive line."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me, knows I am a Mexican food snob. I live in NM, the cuisine here is not, nor can it be duplicated anywhere else. So, when someone invites me out for Mexican food I normally become dismayed. Well, this place is wonderful. It is NOT authentic NM cuisine, however, it is excellent Mexico Mexican food. I enjoyed the shredded beef chimmy with red n green. It came with beans/rice which were amazing for beans n rice. We also enjoyed guacamole , and salsa which was great. There are three (at my last count),  I have tried the other locations, they were pricey. Period. This location is great. Service was great!"}
{"text":"The view is plain awesome.  The food is really good.  The salsa is *actually spicy!*  It does tend to get busy, and when it gets busy, it also gets on the loud side, so if you want to have a quiet conversation, timing is everything."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal for authentic Mexican cuisine, the food itself is just like you were in Mexico City, and not Americanized Mexican. Tacos were delicious. This was a great recommendation from a group staying at the Rio. Would definitely recommend this place for a off strip dining adventure."}
{"text":"This used to be our go to spot for great, authentic Mexican dishes. But the last few times we have gone has completely changed my opinion. We went a few months ago for lunch as a party of 6 and it was as though the plates sat under warmers. The beans and rice were very dry. Then when we decided to go last night the oysters were dry and sticky, the chicken was chewy as if they were to cook it frozen and the Chile Colorado was very tough. The Jamaica was watered down and the \"cadillac\" margarita was made with Suaza although we were asked to have it made with Corzo. Save your money and go to their sister property, El Zapatos."}
{"text":"Visiting from Texas.  Great authentic Mexican food with nice atmosphere and wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Vegas for over 12 years and this is my favorite mexican.  The food is always fresh, cooked to perfection and very affordable.  I've never been there and not been happy.  Their homemade salsa and chips start you off and then it's a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Definitely a must when in Vegas! Every time we are in town we have to stop here for the best in Mexican cuisine. The sauces are all homemade. The guacamole is always fresh. They have the best margaritas in town and you always get a complimentary cup of fideo, chips, Chile, and hot beans before your meal. The Buey al Cilantro is the best steak with the most delicious sauce ever! We keep coming back!!!! The kids love the fried ice cream. Every dish we have had here has been great from the steak and chicken to the shrimp menu. This is probably our 8th time here and it's no joke that we stop here every time we are in Vegas because we aren't locals. This place is a must if you want real, authentic Mexican food made fresh."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the view here. The service is always excellent and the food is good. We come here once a month. We have no complaints."}
{"text":"I use to love this place, great view, pretty good food, lively atmosphere until one of their waiters stole my debit card information. I was dining with my family and once he returned the bill, my card was missing and magically appeared 5 minutes later after questioning him what happened to my card? While I was driving home I happened to check my account to be safe and sure enough within 20 minutes there was an online purchase. I called management at restaurant they never returned my call. This isn't the first time the waiter has done this because the phone number attached to the transaction my bank could not even trace, they seemed to use an online coupon store with over 20,000 vendors and nearly impossible to find the exact one. My advice: food isn't that great and if you want the view, pay cash!"}
{"text":"Ugh never again. It's a nice, clean place that is just not my style. It's SO noisy in this place you cannot even have a conversation with the person across the table with you, no lie, I had to move and sit next to my friend in order to be able to hear what she was saying. As soon as we had a great conversation going the server (Antonio) comes barging into our conversation HELLO ARE YOU READY TO ORDER? I mean what ever happened to a server that approaches quietly and waits for a chance to speak? He just barges up and interrupts my friend who just so happens to be talking about her sick husband. Please send your servers to server school so they can learn how to be courteous, attentive and not rude. Same for food runner, comes up interrupting the discussion and starts the food auction \"who had the quesadilla?\" So tacky, so rude and intrusive. If the server put the order in correctly the runner would not have to auction the food they'd know who ordered what. I wish restaurants would put effort into training their \"wait\" staff, it makes/breaks the entire experience. It's the WORST being rudely interrupted by wait staff, hence the name WAIT. The food. meh -- I've had better in many places around town. This place, with all due respect I am sorry but I am just being honest, is a zoo that I will never go to again, even parking is a nightmare."}
{"text":"Delicious micheladas. Chips with  warm beans and salsa. The waiters are very nice.  Awsome place ans great view. VIVAAAAA Las vegas!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is always great, the restaurant is fun and the staff is so very friendly. Great food at a very inexpensive price. One of my favorite spots in town. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed.  First of all when we walked in the stench of the bathrooms were very present.  We had to change tables so I could breath.  I ordered steak fajitas, it was a bit pricey for food I haven't had but I took a chance,  $18.95, my husband ordered fish tacos.  I was so disappointed! The meat was tender but had absolutely no flavor, I tried the beans and rice, guacamole all the same Flavorless! Who has ever had refried beans they didn't like...  I have thrown away so much money in Vegas trying to find good Mexican food like back in the Oakland Bay Area. It's frustrating...I give up. Anybody heard of Mexicali Rose in Oakland? That's the kind of flavor I'm looking for.  The presentation was good, the steak was sizzling, I thought it was more onions and peppers than anything.  They brought 2 small flour tortillas, there was no cheese and I had to ask for pico de galo, again this flavorless meal was $18.95.  I would advise anyone wanting Mexican food to try Javier's inside the Aria.  It's not old school authentic, but it is good if you don't mind paying a bit more."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Great mole. All-time favorite. Do yourself a favor. Eat here. Off the strip...they'll come and get you!"}
{"text":"This should be a 3.5 star. The food was good (Def for Vegas) service was good as well. My main complaint is the complimentary bean dip was extremely watery and chips should be salted. Really enjoyed the margaritas, had a pitcher and my wife and I both caught a buzz!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. The bartender made a really good patron margarita. The restaurant got really hot and I'm not sure if there air conditioning is holding up to the heat! If I went back I would just try something else on the menu. I always give two tries before I make a decision not to go back. Service was good and a very beautiful view sitting at the bar! Live music was a nice added touch!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican but I am honestly so spoiled living in SoCal. I know I've had better but this'll do.  Stopped here at the insistence of a friend before we hit the strip to club and build our regrets. I was pleasantly pleased with the vegetarian options. I chose the Veggie Fajita plate and it was a huge portion of perfectly seasoned veggies (and not just like, broccoli in some salsa, actual squash, mushrooms, onions, etc that made a pretty decent dish). Beans were ok. Rice was bomb. Tortillas were obviously homemade. I wanted more, but did I need more? Absolutely not.   Price was pretty fair, I think I paid about $15? Not including tip.  I'd come back but I think I'd do a burrito next time."}
{"text":"Man, I dont know what it is but lately I have been having bad experiences. Last place I went to had good food but bad service. Here I had both bad service and bad food. Im hoping the next place I go to I dont have bad anything.   So me and the wifey come here on thursday around 9:15 pm for a late dinner. Since these guys close at 11, we were thinking we should get decent service and decent food as well.  What I got was the Carne Asada Plate ($18.95). It is a thinly cut of New York steak. Comes with refried beans, rice, guacamole, and flour tortillas. My wife got a Shredded Beef Enchilada ($4.50) off the a la carte menu.  Before our order comes out, we are given a basket of chips, bean dip, and salsa to munch on while we waited. I guess we were really hungry because we devoured it in like a minute. Like all other Mexican restaurants, I assumed these things were endless. As our server walked by a couple times to refill our drinks, he never refilled the the chips and dip. So maybe I was wrong about my assumption. Until I saw the next table get another batch. Hmmmm. Sad to say the chips and salsa were the only things with great flavor.  We get our main entrees and it looks delicious. But turns out the steak was bland. The only things that had any kind of flavor on my plate were the grilled jalapeno and small spoonful of guacamole. I had to dip the steak in what little left of the salsa that was provided with the chips. My wife's enchilada was ok but it was obvious that it was microwaved as evidenced by the some of the enchilada sauce surrounding the burrito was crusted. You know when any kind of sauce gets microwaved too long? Yup. Thats how parts of the sauce were.   Service was just a tad below mediocre. I think the table next to us got chips and salsa refilled twice. Not to say that we could of ate that much as well but like I said before I was used to these places constantly refilling those things without hesitation. It also took a while for us to get our check and for the receipt to come back so I can sign it.   So in closing, maybe we just came at the wrong time? Maybe we need to get to the original location off of Desert Inn? If we do, hopefully the food and service will be much better. Until then, im not sure if I want to come back to this particular location.  Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #146 \"Should of just ordered chips and salsa\""}
{"text":"This is my families go to place for Mexican food. We've never had a bad meal here, the service is pretty good considering how busy it always is, and the price isn't that bad since you get big plates. The only time it's loud is during the dinner rush but it's definitely do able. The Margaritas and friend ice cream are also a must and your drinks are always being refilled."}
{"text":"Nice building, nice views, limited parking. The food was ok, not what I was looking for, especially at the price. You are definitely paying for the atmosphere here and I came looking for good food."}
{"text":"5 stars for the amazing view of the city from the top of the hill. And another 5 stars to my tasty margarita that gave me a buzz after just one. Everything else was just blah.   Food: I've dined here a few times already and I've had my fair share of Mexican food. I can honestly say we make way better Mexican food at home. The food is so Americanized and doesn't feel authentic at all. The salsa and beans for the chips were bland and we had to add more salt. The fideo soup that was served with our meals was way too salty. The chicken in the tacos was dry and flavorless. I've had better tacos at Roberto's for way less $. The steak was low quality and chewy. The side of avocado that we ordered was brown and hard. How does that even happen?   Service:  The hostess that was at the stand was a complete b***h. She asked how many were in our party and I said 3. When I proceeded to ask her how long the wait was, she completed ignored me and started talking to the hostess next to her. Another hostess heard me saying how annoyed I was, so she compensated for her rude coworker and was extra nice to us. Our waiter (didn't get his name) was decent enough, but we hardly ever saw him. We only saw him when it was time to order and when it was time to drop off the check. The busser however, was awesome. He cleared our plates, refilled our water and checked on us multiple times. We ended up tipping him on the side and told him not to share with anyone because he did an amazing job.   Ambiance:  It's your typical Mexican restaurant with your regular decor. It's clean with plenty of seating. Get a table by the window. The restaurant sits on top of a hill, so like I said, you get an amazing view of the city.   The quality of the food drops my rating down to a 2. But with the awesome views and drinks, I can give this place a solid 3. Good first date spot, but I'd rather go somewhere else for my Mexican food cravings."}
{"text":"Incredible food and GREAT service. The fresh guacamole is definitely worth it. They even boxed up the extra that we didn't eat with a fresh bag of chips! The view is amazing too. All around great place to go for a meal out."}
{"text":"OMG. Yep, I said it.  Food was outrageously delicious. Ambiance was authentic, creative vibrant and lively. They have a live mariachi band that sings current songs in English and traditional songs in Spanish.  They have a lady in the dining room making the tortillas, beans and soup.  It's a little bit off the strip, so the wait time was non-existent.   Oh, & if THAT wasn't enough... It has held the title of Best of Las Vegas for 6 years.  Just go."}
{"text":"I'm very picky with Mexican food and this is awesome for the price range. The ceviche de pescado is amazingly fresh tasting a must try! The atmosphere is fun and good for kids. Not sure why it only has 3 stars but I'm definitely coming back to this place. Super clean and has great views as well!"}
{"text":"Looking for authentic, delicious, Mexican food?  It's not here.  We went to the Henderson location, at 9 pm, on a Saturday night.  Overcrowded and loud beyond restaurant standards..screaming, clapping, yelling, omg....oh, so,  irritating.  It is slightly elevated on a hill in Henderson, lending it to spectacular, panoramic,  views.  The menu is overpriced and not even good OR AUTHENTIC...but no one cared, they are \"banking it\" on below average quality with above average Mexican food prices .  COCTEL DE CAMERON....13.95 CHILE RELLENO....5.95 CALDEL DE POLLO SOUP ....10.95 CHIPS AND BEAN DIP......0 TORTILLAS WITH MEAL...0  $32 PLUS tax and we didnt get a meal!!! ( the chili relleno gave me indigestion.)  The cameron was tiny, chopped shrimp,  with avocado, I can make a 1/2 gallon of it for that price....the soup was ok for my date, but the chicken was cut in a big chunk and the life was boiled out of it...dry as the bone...  Had to ask for everything and the waiter sucked...more worried about he table of 12, than us....  RESTAURANTS, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WAIT ON 2 PEOPLE, LET US KNOW BEFORE WE WASTE OUR TIME AND MONEY.  Never found great Mexican food in Arizona but it was better than Las Vegas. You are paying for the view."}
{"text":"Everything was out of this world! I had a spicy shrimp dish that was unreal, fajita burritos, both steak and chicken were amazing! Loved the salsa and the soup too. We will be back while we are in town for sure. The entire staff was very nice too."}
{"text":"Best cocktails in town! Went in for a michelada and a cocktail and I was completely satisfied. The shrimp in the cocktail were very fresh, and there was a fair amount in the dish. Also It was great to know that there's a restaurant in Vegas that used more than just clamato mix for there micheladas.  The only down side is the price is a little higher than what I'm used to"}
{"text":"It's off the strip but worth coming. Everyone here is very polite and with excellent food. I would come back again. Thank you Lindo Michoac√°n."}
{"text":"One of the BEST places to eat in Las Vegas! A little bit off the strip. GREAT food and BEAUTIFUL decor. The staff were very FRIENDLY and cater our every need right away.  I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend who was in town visiting. We wanted good Mexican food after we read a few reviews we opted for this place. Upon arrival the place looked packed and walking up we were almost sure we'd have at least a 45min wait, if not longer. Maybe we were lucky but as soon as we came in we had a table available to us and we didn't feel crammed with all the people around. It was comfortable, our servers were really nice and the food was quick! And not in a bad way. We ordered a beer and a margarita and they were both good. Our server brought out a frozen glass for the beer too..even better! We both agreed we'd come back and that it was a cool place."}
{"text":"Beautiful views. Location is their strength here. Their food is good but nothing all that stellar for a sit down. There are many combination meals that start at about $15.  I also had their fast food version at the LV convention center and it was much more affordable and delicious for a quick lunch.  Parking was tough....dont go during the weekend. Wait can be an hr easy and there is no waiting areas making it more difficult to wait. The bar is inside and small and cant really grab a drink and stand around bc thr bar sits low. Awkward.  If you come for your bday they put on a sombrero and sing for you and THEN they give you a shot (or 2). They literally feed you the shot which is funny.  I had the whole fish....red snapper. And it was good. Didnt understand why it came with fries though."}
{"text":"Awesome. Came here our first night in town. Best hot sauce ever. Great service. Friendly and huge menu. Ate here two years ago and had to go again. Guess what I'll be back for a third time."}
{"text":"You can't beat the city views from this place. The food is pretty good, but way better at the original location! It's a bit loud, especially with all the birthday celebrations going on."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this place. I have been to all of their locations and this us the best of them all. The food is always perfect, service is always great, the drinks are always tasty and the desert is always the perfect end to a quality dining experience"}
{"text":"I have been to the other locations and this location seems to be on par with the rest. I come from Los Angeles where Mexican restaurants are on every corner all ranging from one store to phenomenal five stars. Las Vegas seems to be lacking a true Mexican spirited restaurant but this comes as close to it as possible.  The one thing that stands out above and beyond this location from the other locations as well as many other Mexican restaurants is the incredible view. This alone makes it worth the drive and the trip. Perfect for a romantic getaway or a special occasion.  If you're fortunate enough to get seated along the window section then definitely try to get here after sunset. We were seated in the main dining room where they had \"an entertainer.\" Not sure exactly where they found this guy but I hope they're not paying him much.  We started off with the cheese fondue. I'm a traditionalist and I love their version. Just some plain melted jack cheese with some green chilies served with warm flour tortillas. I suggest splurging for the sour cream or guacamole which compliments this exceptionally. If you don't want to splurge then it goes perfectly with the complementary bean dip and salsa that they provide. We gave this a solid 5/5.  I proceeded to have the shrimp ceviche salad. It's served inside and avocado shell, skin. Nice big juicy chunks of shrimp marinade it perfectly with lime juice served with tomatoes and onions. The amount you get for the price you pat is fabulous. I give this one a 5/5 as well.  My friend went ahead and got the combination. A taco and a chili relleno. The chile was small, lacked flavor and had some salads on top that lacked any real merit. It was accompanied with a shredded beef taco. Meat was secretly under seasoned. The shell itself seemed to be old and quickly fried again to give it some crispy ness. Beans and rice were lacking. Taco Bell standard at its highest. 2/5 for the combo.  We finished with the fried ice cream. Not bad, not great. Caramel sauce they drizzle on top was decent.  Overall it was good. I got the feeling service would have been better if we had been drinking or the tab was higher. Had to ask for refills on drinks a few times. Other than that the highlight for this place is the view for sure."}
{"text":"So hubby & I were hungry & was supposed to eat Italian for dinner but the restaurant closed a lil early...no big deal so we decided to eat at lindos since it was already 1030p & other restaurants wee closed already.    We've eaten here countless times & always had a great experience, service & food...but tonite was horrible..his chicken dish was bland & my shrimp taco was salty plus the normal cream sauce wasn't even on it.  I know there were just a couple of tables open & we sat at the bar, but it closes at 2am people!!!  The bartender was too busy tallying up her shift & finally asked us if we were ready to order...then after our food came it had to take me looking at this guy to tell her to come check on us!!! We had recommended this place to so many of our out of town guests...well forget it now...I don't know if they've changed the crew or what but it sucks Should've ate at GVR!"}
{"text":"Best Authentic mexican food period!!! This place is extreamly busy and loud noice with their music and the people talking, But maaan... the food and the service is above the excellent! Stake Congac and stake ranchero is the best of the grill and all the other food are very tasty and traditional touch!!"}
{"text":"BEWARE..................................... ! BEWARE.........................................! ! !  We know better than to go to this location.  It is very close to the house, but we have always been disappointed.  The service is medicore at best, although you can see most of the employees are trying - they always seem to be understaffed. The food is .the worst version of American Mexican. The drink comp based on gaming requires a manager to review your bill, then they will only give the absolute minimum. How is this place a 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I went here at lunchtime with a group of 5. We walked in and were seated immediately even thought the place was packed.  All of food was well prepared, served hot and exactly as ordered.  They made a special fresh batch of haberno salsa for us!  Love this place!  I wish all their properties were as good as this one.  The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is that they are to far away from us."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to lindo michoacan to grab dinner and get tattoos... :) I have to say I had a really good experience. The service was very fast, as soon as we walked in we were seated, then the chips came like 10s after, every thing rolled smoothly. Everyone seemed very pleasant, one of the managers I think his name was Oscar, checked on us...a lot lol but he was very nice. Our waiter was very honest lol, but everything was cool i was really full; the quesidilla were heaven! and pretty big in portion for an appetizer, i was full before my food came which the waiter kind of hinted at when i was ordering lol but overall I would go there again....i just hope they stay concistant  with the great service"}
{"text":"Dinner here last night. Got a table near the windows - fabulous nighttime view. We had shrimp and beef fajitas, beef tacos and chicken enchiladas. The beef in my fajitas seemed to need a little more grilled flavor, as they seemed a bit tasteless. Quantities were good though. Loved the tortillas that came with my dish though - they were big, not the usual small ones. You only get 2 though, but since they're burrito-sized, that is ok. By the way, the free chips come with a nice salsa and bean dip - both were quite tasty. Seems like a fun place for a party or drinks - quite loud, and people seemed to be having a good time."}
{"text":"This place is great for happy hour! I went there with a group of co-workers to enjoy the margaritas and food. The waiter Loaizan (i didn't spell his name right) was fantastic, professional, and patient. We will be back!"}
{"text":"You could do a lot worse than the food here, while the view and staff are each top-notch. Be mindful of the parking situation, as the lot fills up quickly."}
{"text":"I live in the apartment community right next to this place. So I am a regular. I love the  mango margarita and their chicken quesadilla. Awesome place to dine."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican! I heard about this place from a friend who had visited this place during a previous trip to Vegas. The recommendation was certainly appreciated as the food was outstanding.   The customer service was amazing and we were greeted by multiple smiling staff as we walked in. We were provided with complimentary chips, salsa, and beans. All were amazing. We ordered the table side guacamole which was good, but not amazing. It lacked some flavor but the presentation was awesome.   We were also served complimentary \"Fidel Soup\" which was almost like a flavorful tomato soup with noodles and it was delicious!   My main dish was the chimichanga with melted cheese on top. The thing was HUGE and I could barely eat half. I was also saving room for fried ice cream! I would certainly recommend getting that as a sweet treat to end the meal.   This place is a must if you're feeling adventurous and want to travel off the strip in Vegas. They also have multiple locations!"}
{"text":"The most amazing Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas this location is the one to go to. I've been to all locations several times. I suggest fajitas steak and Chicken with table side guacamole. The fideo soup is on point every time it's tres chaud so be aware. The management is extremely attentive and well groomed."}
{"text":"Usually a big fan, I guess the menu is different with locations. I went in with the intentions of having tortilla soup, and instead I got the caldo de pollo because they didn't have tortilla soup. All I ate was the vegetables because the chicken tasted weird, overall I wasn't happy with my dinner."}
{"text":"Large authentic Mexican food. However the food was just ok in my opinion. And the service is slow."}
{"text":"I ordered carnitas. Our soup was lukewarm. Dinner took a long time to arrive not only for our table but for everyone around us. It was odd that no tables were being served and then the entire areas tables were all served at once after waiting for so long.   There was no guacamole with my dinner. I asked if it came with it because I thought I remembered seeing it in the photo on the menu. The server went and asked and came back and said the green sauce was a guacamole sauce.   The next morning I checked the menu online and saw that it was supposed to come with both a green sauce and guacamole.   It's a nice view though."}
{"text":"Slow service and slow business. The fish was burnt a bit, but still good, and the rice was hard and grainy-undercooked. Okay otherwise. Strawberry lemonade was pretty great."}
{"text":"We decided to give Lindo Michoacan a second chance. After three years, we were all satisfied. The waiter was very attentive. Big portions. Food was decent  No wow factor. The view of the valley was my favorite part of my experience."}
{"text":"Food was good (not outstanding but good) and so was the margarita. This is the style of mexican restaurant where tourists gathered, music is loud and the staff sing along for birthdays. Not the authentic kind but the kitschy ones. Had a good time but would not have picked it myself."}
{"text":"In addition to the food being terrible, the service was awful. The worst I've experienced in a long time. Neither the bus staff nor the waiters ever gave eye contact. They rushed through taking our order and didn't answer any questions we asked. The wait stood at one end of the table to take orders and didn't walk closer as he took other orders. We were a party of 7 at a large table. My parents (late 70's) were at the far end and couldn't here him. He only moved closer when I asked him to do so. When poring coffee, the waiter reached across me to pour a cup for the person next to me. They also never came back to fill our drinks until we flagged them down. No one was friendly or ever smiled. Not a great Sunday meal with the family."}
{"text":"Carne Asada tacos were great, service was decent and the Mango Margarita on the rocks was pretty small and left a lot to be desired in the flavor department. I would definitely return again if i was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"View is pretty awesome.  I've been for both breakfast and dinner. Food is good and service was great.  Breakfast was delicious and it was beautiful outside so the view over coffee was nice to take in.  As for the dinner, the only downside I can say is about the wait... I made reservations for 8:30... got in early at 8 to wait for the table since we had family meeting with us. Everyone one was hangry so we thought we might get seated sooner. WRONG. It was just shy of 9:45 when they finally called us. So my experience wasn't as good as it could have been but I'm willing to give it another try.  Enjoy the live music!"}
{"text":"Service was decent, the Strip view is fantastic, but the food was bland. The menu describes many dishes as authentic Mexican \"what mama used to make\"...but I imagine she was a better cook!? I ordered two chicken enchiladas with rice and beans- the shredded chicken tucked inside was dry and flavorless while  the verde sauce on top was practically null. We ordered a chicken breast and rice for the kiddo which was luke warm / cold upon the first bite taken. My husband ordered steak and didn't complain much but when I asked him what he thought he simply said \"I've had better.\" So even with all the cars lined up the drive way and a full parking lot this restaurant manages to keep the crowd - just stick with drinks and the view if you must."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Service was slow, sucked, and the guy just seemed like he didn't want to be there.  Chips tasted old, guacamole was  tasteless.  Soup tastes like dishwater and the food was just bland.  Shrimp was over cooked and just little tiny pieces.   It was a real disappointment and another one not to go back to."}
{"text":"The first time my sister took me here I ordered the chevice I thought it was going to just be okay so I didn't get my hopes up. I ordered some drinks but I didn't even drink them until after I ate the chevice because it was amazing and I stuffed myself eating it. I shared maybe one bite and had to stay a hour to finish my drinks. I don't live in Nevada so my stomach is always thinking about this place and trying to substitute the flavor until I go back out there but nothing gets me there until I visit."}
{"text":"My friends took me to this restaurant raving how good the food is. When we got there it was  Friday night and there was a lineup at the door but it moved pretty quick.  Inside there was a band and they come and sing for people who are celebrating birthdays. If you are looking for a quiet place to have dinner this is not the place!  As soon as we sat down they brought fresh home made corn chips, salsa and bean dip. The menu was very extensive. We ordered guacamole that they made front of us and it was the best! Every thing was very tasty and prices reasonable. Next time in Vegas I will definitely be returning to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding. Friends from in town strongly recommended Dish restaurant and we were not disappointed. We all ordered different traditional dishes and Specialties and shared. Finished with flan which was delicious too. Our new favorite Off the Strip Restaurant. We will be back. Servers and entire staff very attentive and on point."}
{"text":"The original Lindo Michoacan! Although I've only ate at this location, I've heard you can't eat at any other location but this one. It does not compare.  This place is uhhmaaazing. Hands down, the best shrimp ceviche in town. It has the perfect amount of lime juice in it. The perfect amount of shrimp. No one else compares!  I love how when you order guacamole they make is fresh. So fresh that they make it right in front of you. And let me tell you, one of the best guacamoles I have ever tasted. When they make it, they make plenty. I had to actually take it to go. And the day after guac taste just as good!  They also always bring out a cup of their soup. Very simple but very tasteful.   When going to a mexican restaurant you always have to order a Margarita! I got a Mango Margarita. It was so good. They put lucas on the ring of the cup. Bomb.  Service was good. Nothing to complain about. Great place to get my mexican fix."}
{"text":"Carlos is the worst server there.      I was sat got my drink and then waited 10 mins for the Guac that I wanted.  Mean while a table gets sat next to us and the place wasn't busy like it has been last time I went there.   The other table gets drink and their order taken before he even thinks about taking ours then walks away.  No water in our glasses I am out of my beverage from the bar I have to wave him down and get him to come over to me I ask for the bill because I am tired of dealing with idiots and then all of a sudden he wants to be the best waiter in the restaurant.   I told him not to bother his manager because I didn't want to waste his time.  There is nothing that the manager could have done even if he spoke with me to please me after this visit here.   Yet to remind you that I live 24 miles away from the restaurant in North North Las Vegas.  Needless to say I will no longer go back to visit this restaurant.    This is the first time that I got so mad that I left a restaurant.  I am a chef and I know that sometimes people are busy but when half the restaurant is full that is not busy.  It just means that you knew someone to get the job and trust me the only break this guy got was when they hired him."}
{"text":"THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN TOWN.   Their fideo is amazing. The chips and salsa are amazing. The mariachi is amazing. Their margaritas are amazing. And the food? AMAZING.  I come here all the time and definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes great Mexican food."}
{"text":"Lindo's is usually a good spot they rarely disappoint. The menu has your classic authentic Mexican food and softer stuff for the kiddos as well. The staff here are super friendly and treat you well so that's always a plus. I'm not sure if I came during rush hour or what but it was super busy.   They have a bar, televisions, and a really nice decor. You can see them warming fresh tortillas while your waiting to be seated. Also if its your birthday you will probably get the loudest birthday song ever here :) enjoy."}
{"text":"View awesome...Food not so much.  Chili-rellano was soggy, chicken enchilada had no flavor and tasted like it was boiled in sodium free tomatoes sauce the best thing I had was the tamale and it was a mush and fell apart on my plate."}
{"text":"My 2nd time here  and definitely  not my last. This place has the best food, great prices, strolling mariachi,  live music, clean, nice decor & friendly servers. Love the beans and fideo u get b4 the meal. They make fresh guacamole at your table and gave us a free round for texting their promo code! Sweet deal! Tab for 4, with 20% tip, was only $104. Love this place"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Service was amazing! Everyone did their job really well. Their bussers & servers were all hard-working. Our busser always made sure to refill our drinks. I felt well taken cared of. As for food, I ordered the Kikiriki Erika. This dish was amazing!!! For dessert we tried the fried ice cream. The sauce they used made my mouth happy and the actual ice cream tasted better than vanilla. I cannot think of anything negative to say about this place. We liked this place so much that we left them w/ a really really good tip. :)"}
{"text":"I've come to eat here on several different occasions and it's amazing Mexican food! Their food is all extremely generously portioned and fresh. The guacamole appetizer that is prepared tableside is probably the best I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant. There's a really fun vibe here and all the waiters are attentive and quick.   I highly recommend eating at Lindo Michoacan!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Menu is enormous. Enjoyed two burritos, one chicken and one beef, very tasty!  Would return for a second try...why not, they had a lie mariachi band!!  Great place!!"}
{"text":"if i can give it no stars i would!  this place was recommended by a local and we decided to try it out. started out with drinks, the micheladas have \"caldo de camar√≥n\" they dont tell you that and 2 of our friends are allergic to shrimp! second we waited ober ans hour for our food, we ordered 4 plates of menudo and were antsi to eat and once we dug in the menudo was cold! this is not a professional place, as we tried to get attention of servers they would just stand and look at who was up in singing. i will never come back to this place its so disrespectful to use the state name of michoac√°n when everything here does not represent the state!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,prices are good,great service and food quality awesome ! Don't  forget to order the Margaritas with fresh squeeze lemon!  \"Outstanding\"The server Carlos was great!!"}
{"text":"Drove by here thousands of times, but never actually went in to give it a try. Was craving Mexican food so my sister and I decided to try this place out. We went during dinner time on a weekend and there were lots of seats and tables available, so that's not a good sign, but hey never judge a book by its cover. We were seated very fast  and were given tortilla chips, salsa, and refried beans. My sister ordered the Carnitas while I ordered the Stephanie. Both our foods came out dry and even though the Stephanie is covered in sauce on the chicken, it was still really dry. The chips and dips did not taste like they were fresh or hand made. Our chips tasted like it came from a grocery store, same thing with the salsa. Service wasn't that great considering our server never asked if we wanted a refill on our drinks or if everything was good or if we wanted more chips and salsa. Overall, I wouldn't come back here unless I had a friend that REALLY wanted to go here. Solid 3 star."}
{"text":"Coming from the Bay Area, where the SF Mission has some of the best Mexican food around and then living for 5 years in Socal, I thought the Vegas Mexican food experience would be very underwhelming. Lindo Michoacan has definitely changed my mind! The restaurant itself is more sprawling than other restaurants and there's a lot of different types of seating (booths, patio area, long tables, etc.). Our servers/runners were on top of it and we were never left wanting chips, salsa, bean dip, water, etc. The chicken in my enchiladas was soft and flavorful and my fiance really enjoyed the fajitas he ordered. I preferred this place over Bonita Michoacan (they might be the same owners),  where I had a Groupon, but that location was farther from us and the parking wasn't ideal. I guess the fairer comparison is against Frank and Fina's Cocina, which is right around the corner. I would say I didn't enjoy the atmosphere as much at F&F and the staff there definitely catered to the regulars a bit more, so we had to wait awhile to get worker's attention on a lot of things.  All in all, until I find a better restaurant, Lindo Michoacan will be the go-to Mexican spot."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat and listen to live music. Birthday celebration was topped by a shot of Tequila. Great service and hospitality."}
{"text":"I have been to one other \"Lindo,\" and I have to say that its location paled in comparison to this one. The vistas from this resto are fantastic -- you can see the entire Vegas skyline and the atmosphere inside the resto is very bright and cheerful.   Too bad the small parking lot cannot accommodate the number of diners here on a Sat. night. This is the second time I've had dinner here on a weekend and waited for more than 15 min for a spot!   But, onto the food.... the food at Lindo is surprisingly bland for a Mexican place. The table-side prep of the guac is a nice touch (as was the guac itself -- our server made it perfectly)... though the rest of the meal was so-so. My girl and I shared two shrimp entrees -- the shrimp enchiladas and the shrimp a la diablo. Both were served SUPER SIZE style -- seriously. We should have gotten one entree to share between the two of us.... We would have packed the excess... had the food been better. SIGH.   Unfortunately, the Diablo in the shrimp dish must have gotten lost somewhere in the kitchen. Despite a couple of red chiles that I saw floating in the bright red sauce in which the shrimp were served, this dish was SUPER bland. Talk about a bait and switch!! As for the enchiladas, the tortilla to everything else ratio (cheese, sauce, shrimps) was off.... each time I took a bite, all I tasted was the mushy tortilla.   Oh well.... at least the place is pretty, and the servers are nice. Next time, I'll stick to liquids (their margaritas on the rocks are good), and guac."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!! Have been coming here for years. Friendly staff and the food is always delicious. Great environment"}
{"text":"The chips and salsa were very good and the guacamole which is made fresh at the table was excellent. The atmosphere is great and the service was impeccable!"}
{"text":"A must try while in Vegas! Love the food and the service is great! We come to Vegas twice  a year and we visit this place twice year! A nice reminder of our Lindo Michoacan! Valentin y Walter son atentos con sus clientes...me encanta este lugar! La comida es aut√©ntica! Hasta la pr√≥xima!"}
{"text":"I love doing a late lunch at this place, while its not too busy. I ask for a spot next to the windows to get that great view of the city. The food is always good and authentic. I like to order the guacamole- they make it in front of you. Their margaritas and pina coladas are spot on. Love the atmosphere, and how large the restaurant is. Its a beautiful restaurant and its place in a beautiful spot. Restaurant is clean, the servings are big, the servers always check in on you, and refill your drinks before they become empty.  I think some of the negative reviews on here are of especially picky people or perhaps they had encountered a newbie- or also perhaps they meant to review the Lindo Michocan on Desert Inn rd. I'd like to think myself as a picky person, and I've never had an issue with this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have to second Elysia E's review of Lindo in Henderson.... I'm a huge fan of the Sahara and Eastern location and almost all others, but my entire party was disappointed with our experience here.  It has been said that the building they took over was formerly an Italian location with a fantastic view of the city and Lindo seems like they put up some cheap decor and painted the walls.  The location on Sahara and Eastern makes you feel like your in a traditional cantina with a bevy of fine tequila's and hispanic culture.    Onward to the food.... My girlfriend order the chimichangas which were a huge disappointment and had to be sent back.  We try to never send back food from both working in the restaurant industry.  Furthermore, my carne asada was tough and chewy.  I still ate my weight in bean and salsa dip along with everyone else.    I just would love to see the same consistency at the Henderson location that I'm used to from Lindo.  Not to worry..... I still plan on stopping in for fresh made tortillas often :)"}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant in Vegas period.  This place is awesome and traditional mexican with the best handmade flour tortilla's and salsa in the Vegas area.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"service, food, out of this world the best. daniel my server was the best the manager edgar stop on several ocassions to check if everything was good everybody is very friendly i love this place."}
{"text":"I love the service Said gave as a Buzer he was very nice and attentive. Our waiter Danie was awesome, he made the best guacamole."}
{"text":"Really really good.  I typically am not a big fan of Mexican restaurants, at least in the US - they tend to be fairly bland, and the ingredients are not particularly high-quality. Michoacan was a pleasant change - everything was excellent.  There were only two downsides to the meal, which are pretty minor: the lemonade was fountain syrup stuff, or at least that was my impression of it.  Secondly, the mariachi band (Friday night) was great, but they are SO FREAKING LOUD that conversation is all but impossible.  It's not a big place, and a little brass goes a long way.  But those are minor quibbles."}
{"text":"My lovely daughter and I came here to have dinner and were expecting this place to be just a regular Mexican restaurant. Food was excellent and so was the service. The prices are reasonable and I highly recommend this place for dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious chips, salsa, and bean dip. Service has always been excellent. Frequent drink and chip refills. Had several dishes from their menu, all came with a little bowl of soup always more appreciated in the winter than summer. A family favorite to visit."}
{"text":"Have to say that with all the Mexican food I have had, this is close to the best.  With  the quality of the food matched with the view...this place is worth a visit.  Last night was my fifth visit and I was not disappointed.  The only thing between 4 stars  and getting that fifth star is the service. It's OK but not what I would call great. But because of the food, I am willing to put up with mediocre service. I literally asked 3 different servers for a glass of water. Finally when the food arrived \"is there anything else I can get you\"? He'll yeah, a frick'n glass of water. When in Vegas, try this place."}
{"text":"We decided to celebrate a friend's birthday here the other night and it was my first time ever dining here. We actually went on a Monday afternoon, which was during happy hour and offering some good prices on lunch specials as well.  (+) Those happy hour specials were good! We were enjoying Dos Equis and Corona drafts for $3 each! They are known for their margaritas and have a ton of other drink options at good prices! (+) Lunch specials offered a lot of options at very good prices! (From $8.95 to $12.95) (+) Service was very good and attentive. We started out as 3 and then turned into a group of 5. We were checked on repeatedly by multiple employees. It was fantastic! I never felt like I had to wait a long time to request something or ask a question. (+) free chips with salsa an dip. refilled often and without requesting it. This was a great feature too! (+) the view of the strip from behind the bar looked cool af. I bet it looks great at night!  (-) As great as all that is, the food is honestly average at best. I really, really wanted to love this place but the food just kills it. It wasn't horrible, by any means. It was just very underwhelming. It was about on the level with Hotel Casino EDR food. Nothing I would ever crave to eat again. lol  which is a shame.   I may just come back one day because the service was outstanding, the atmosphere IS fun, and the drink specials are pretty good. I will just have much more tempered expectations when it comes to the food.  3 stars.  It is A-Ok."}
{"text":"this place would be great except now there is a loud ass band playing which makes it impossible to enjoy dinner"}
{"text":"The food was okay, but I was expecting much more considering all the positive raving about it.  Has an authentic feel, but the flavors were somewhat bland.  Sorry to say, Tacos El Gordo is a better bet."}
{"text":"Tried this one too and the food wasn't bad, but I've had better.  Ambience is nice but the food is not something I'd wait for again."}
{"text":"Erick was our server. He's so great that I'm writing this in the parking lot so I don't forget. We were the only ones sitting outside so it wasn't convenient to serve us. He made excellent table side guacamole. Had no problem letting our 6 year old order right where we arrived. He had two people help him, I wish I caught all their names because the service was spot on. Drinks and chips were always full and he brought soup right away.   I had to take 1 star away for the food. My little one got a kids burrito. If your child orders one just know there is melted cheese on top, you may want to request no cheese. My teenager ordered a steak quesadilla but did not like it at all. He only ate one piece. I ordered a side bean taco and an enchilada   I did not like the enchilada at all, but my teen was starving so he ate it, said it was ok. My taco was just beans and tomato, no cheese or lettuce so it was pretty bland. Husband got chiliquillas. He wasn't a fan but he's picky with chiliquillas.   We would not go back for the food but we would totally go back for drinks and guacamole if Erick was our server! We did not complain about the food."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to this restaurant a couple years ago when my realtor took me to eat & have drinks for Cinco de Mayo. It was awesome!! Recently my friend was coming in town for his birthday so I called to make reservations and request a table with a nice view....I could tell the guy I spoke with (I can't remember his name) was barely paying attention to me....and something told me he would have something messed up... When we arrived...they didn't even have a reservation at all!!!!!!! They asked me if I was sure I called the right location! I'm 100% sure I called this location in Henderson. However we were seated (in a corner table) and I had to stress about how I would tell them it was my friends bday so they could come out and sing to him (and embarrass him a little lol) ..... The waiter was actually really great!! And the food was real good.....so....this is why I left 4 stars. Maybe it was an honest mistake when I called....I realize things happen.... I definitely plan on going back sometime soon, the food is so good !!!"}
{"text":"This place really impressed us on our last visit about a week ago. We had been here a few times before but this most recent visit prompted a review write up.  My father in law, his wife, and my husband and were seated very promptly for our early dinner (about 5:30pm) on a Saturday night. We were seated at a window table with an incredible view of the town. We were immediately greeted and our drink orders were taken. Renee and his team were ON THE BALL! our orders were taken, our drinks were always filled and chip bowls never empy. I never even had to request anything being the guys were VERY aware and observant of what was going on and never missed a beat in making sure we had everything. It really depends on preference but i did not feel they intruded or interrupted our dinner and conversations.  The meals were great, and always is so I dont get why people comment the food is not very good. I have tried multiple dishes and it has always been as good as any other nicer Mexican restaurant. Yes, the prices are higher, almost all shrimp dishes were 18.99 but you can get the combo meals towards the end of the menu at reasonable prices of about 11.00. This is not Roberto's, Cafe Rio or anything similar, this is a nice restaurant to expect to pay the price.   After finishing our meals, we continued to order drinks and Renee and his guys basically left us alone and we did not feel rushed so we took our time to enjoy the view, drinks, and great conversations.   I will say the only minimal downsides were the parking as usual, if you dont get there early, parking is very limited so you have to park at the parking lot across or along the street.  Also, there was a larger party seated somewhat close to us that had crying babies so that is not the restaurants fault but was a little distracting.   The overall experience definitely made for an excellent night out.  Try and get seating on either corner end of the restaurants where it has great views, feels a little more intimate, and is also quieter than the main center seating area."}
{"text":"Tasty, fresh, satisfying Mexican food.  The menu is diverse (but not too overwhelming) and ingredients are of good quality.  Unlike most \"mexican\" joints in town, Lindo Michoacan offers a wide range of authentic meals, not just the typical meat and beans drowned in rubbery cheese and bland sauce.  They allow the flavors of the ingredients to be the feature of the meal.  Plus, it's very vegetarian friendly!  Table-side guacamole preparation is a treat for some (although if you often make your guacamole at home it's not as enchanting as it is for some patrons), and an attentive and friendly wait staff avoid being overbearing.  This has become our staple \"sit-down\" neighborhood Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Customer service was great. My eggs and chorizo were great, but everything else was so so. I was not impressed with anything else I ate. The refried beans were cold and salsa had very strange flavor that I didn't enjoy. This place is great for the view that's about it."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food. Best service. Best place to celebrate anything. LOVE this place."}
{"text":"This place is the total package, you're greeted & seated by friendly staff. The waiters are awesome, so friendly and very informative if you have questions. The food is out of this world, authentic and delicious & you have so many dishes to choose from.  Their table side guacamole is a masterpiece! They also have a great bar with many tequila choices. Even when they are packed & waiting for your seat they don't rush you. We went in Friday both times we've been and by the bar they have a singer and they also have a group of Mariachi singers going around the restaurant singing Happy Birthday, etc. All of those who sang had amazing voices.  When you're on your way out they open the door & invite you back Like I said they have it all, perfect place for a night out."}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely a local's favorite with the best view of the city in town! I recommend the steak Ranchero and Chile Colorado however I do not think you can go wrong with their menu! The only downfall to our last experience was that the wait was nearly 45 minutes but the bar was more than accommodating. So with that being said, I would definitely recommend calling to make a reservation prior to your visit!"}
{"text":"We came for the Sema show and found this place on yelp. When it comes to mexican food there are soo many places to choose from in Vegas.   This place was a few miles from the strip, I don't think I've ever been that far away from the strip but it was definitely worth it.   Everything was fresh, tasty, hot and authentic. It was a Saturday night and they had live music. Will definitely come back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food and service. The waiter never came to check on us, didn't come to refill any drinks.  The chicken enchiladas was dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas!   They serve delicious complimentary chips, salsa, warm bean dip and soup with tomato broth and pasta. The portions are huge. Lots of fresh veggies in the rice. My husband ordered steak--the waiter had the chef grill a second steak because the first was overcooked. I loved the shredded beef taco.   Their lunch specials last until 5:00 (for vegas partiers who wake up late) and are half the price of dinners.   The restaurant is nicely decorated with authentic colorful pottery, glass sconces, pots, fountains, comfortable booths and solid wood tables and chairs. The servers wear traditional clothes and were all friendly.   Free lollipops for dessert!"}
{"text":"Love this place NO DOUBT! The Shredded Chicken Burrito is a must when I get the chance to go here! I Love it. I also love their appetizer, the tortilla chips and dip, I Just Love it. When there is a birthday, they are just the happiest workers and people. The Ambience is Loveable and makes you want to have a live in Lindo's! Hell, If I were rich, they'd be part of my kitchen!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with friends and had a great time. It's definitely a fun environment. The food is good, I won't say great but for a fun night out close to home it was great. I did go again last night with family and had really poor customer service from the host staff. Being that it was a Sat. Night, and I new from previous experiences that it was a loud busy place, I made a reservation a day in advance. I made sure to request a quiet nice table. Now, I'm fully aware that i can just request a nice table, not reserve one, but upon arrival I let the hostess know we would be happy to wait past our reservation time for a nice table (it was a special occasion). The woman working said no problem and it would just be a few min. When we were sat at our table it was right in the middle of 2 birthday party tables, and a small table had been pushed up to ours and stuck out in the isle to accommodate our guest. (We were only a party of 5) it was extremely loud and uncomfortable because 1 of our guest was sitting in the middle of the isle not facing any of the rest of us. We couldn't even hear ourselves talk. I politely asked another hostess as she passed by a few min. After we were seated if we could be moved and she said it would be a very long wait. So we unhappily stayed at our table. My fianc√© decided to take one of our guest down to the other side of the restaurant to show them the view we were hoping for and there were 3 empty tables where we would like to be. A manager passed by and I asked again and he said \"no problem, right this way\". He was very nice and moved us and also brought all of our drinks down for us as well. Overall I just was dissatisfied with the attitude and the way the hostess handled the situation. We were happy to wait longer for a nicer table but instead they sat us early, before our reservation time at one of the worst tables in the place. It really did start the night off in a very uncomfortable way."}
{"text":"Out of all 3 Lindo's in the valley, this one wins with the view.  Unfortunately it is also the busiest location and they have a tiny parking lot, so expect to park in the office lot across the street.  Back to the view, they have large glass windows which look out onto the entire Vegas skyline.  The restaurant sits on top of a small hill within an already elevated part of Henderson, which provides the best view for a price in town!  Food wise I can't taste a big difference between all the locations, but I still prefer the original DI location for its classic feel.  You can easily fill up with a $15 combo plate here and the food will be very consistent!"}
{"text":"The staff at this location was very friendly, bussers, waitstaff and runners all asked about our meal and refilled our water. It almost became over-kill but I'd rather have a full glass of water than be thirsty!  Food is normal Lindo quality and consistency for a very fair price. While I might not crave their food as much as other places, I always know ill get a solid meal no matter what I order!"}
{"text":"Overall one of the best Mexican places I've had in Vegas.  Since re-locating here I've had some problems finding a good value when it comes to meals.  Lindo has become a \"go to\" place for me and many of my friends because of the portion size and affordable price.  I normally get a simple combo plate for around $15.  This place does not try to be fancy and flashy which is another reason I'm attracted to it."}
{"text":"Yummy food, great portions. It was a little crowded, but it was a Saturday night, so what do you expect. I ordered sopitas as an appetizer and had the beef flautas for dinner. The sopitas were so filling, that I could only get through one flauta! I ate the rest the next day for lunch and they were still yummy. Make sure to come here hungry! I couldn't even imagine getting dessert, I was so full, but I did allow myself a glass of horchata, which didn't disappoint! Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!!! Wholly, so good. Chicken enchilada verdes, the best!!! Tableside made guacamole, the best ever. The chips, the bean dip. So yummy. We've already book marked this place. I wish I could remember the name of the cab driver that referred us to this place. Thanks:)"}
{"text":"Best vibe and Mexican spot in Vegas! The view is Amazing, The margaritas are best in LV. Service is top quality. You pay for vibe, as far as food, the rice is bland, chips and dip are great, soup is great, the dishes are ok, but Vegas isn't known for Mexican food so it's the best you'll get.  I eat authentic Mexican regularly from our family and this isn't close, but we still come for the atmosphere and consistency"}
{"text":"So...I do not eat much Mexican food....but this place is excellent. A great variety of menu items above and beyond the usual boring choices you would find anyplace else. Not to mention the amazing service. I might have to start eating Mexican more often....plus I live right around the corner....don't know what took me so long to try this place."}
{"text":"I love Lindo.  I do.  But after three or four visits, I've come to the realization that it's the atmosphere that I love, not the food.  Thus, I can only justify a three star rating.   I went here in December for a work Christmas party and got the surf and turf.  I ordered my steak medium rare and it came out so incredibly rare that I could only eat the outside edges.  On top of that, I'm quite certain I could have gone to Albertson's for a better steak and I'm 110% certain that I could have cooked it better.  What really got me though was the lobster.  Never have I had a more overcooked, rubbery, dry lobster.  It was an incredible disappointment.  My more recent visits included ordering shrimp rellano that was pretty unremarkable and a pork chimichanga that was the last straw on my love/hate affair with Lindo Michoacan.  Maybe it's standard for a chimi but there was quite literally nothing inside the tortilla other than the meat.  No beans, no rice, no cheese, no sour cream, no guacamole.  Nada!  It was just dry and bland and not good at all.  I literally ate the rice and beans and called it a night.   Now for the good part.  The ambiance.  The atmosphere.  The entertainment.  The people.  The view!  All of those aspects are spot on here.  It's a fun spot especially for a group.  Loud, vibrant, decorated like a kitschy joint you might see across the border.  There's a one man mariachi band that's funny and entertaining as hell.  Take note that the wait is long.  Like really long.  Parking is almost nonexistent and usually the street next to the restaurant is lined with cars that couldn't find a spot in the main lot.  I've even seen people park at the closed business park across the street.   I wish so badly that the food was proportionate to the ambiance.  For me, it's just not.  Full disclosure: I'll probably be back just for the atmosphere...cross my fingers I find something on the menu that's muy bueno."}
{"text":"Service is and has always been outstanding. The staff is always wonderful, especially on your birthday! They sing and dance. Living in Vegas it was always a fantastic spot to come to for great filling Mexican food & if you enjoy a diverse selection of tequila, Lindo has is covered.  The price is fantastic and the food is authentic.  NOT TO MENTION THE VIEW. The view of the entire Vegas Valley and Las Vegas strip is right out the windows."}
{"text":"Have had much better experiences with Mexican food. Parking was horrible; tight irregular parking lot that was over filled. Had to park across the street. Restaurant was way too loud. Had to yell to hear someone across the table. Beverages and Chips and salsa were rapidly refilled and soup (came with every meal) was delivered as soon as the order was placed. Soup was tasty, but everything else missed the mark. Enchiladas tasted burnt, tacos were cold and greasy, Chile Rellenos had congealed cheese. Prices were much higher than they needed to be for the dinner received.   As my sister-in-law stated, come for the service, not the food. Save yourself the money and order from Roberto's."}
{"text":"The food was awesome, I really loved it!! The only thing I can say is that it was very loud and hectic, but cool. It was a great time though, lots of fun!"}
{"text":"I came to eat Lindo Michoacan after hearing the podcast Latinos Who Lunch rave about it for over a year! The inside decor of this place is so beautiful and the ambiance of the place is really lively. I came in very hungry lol so I ordered a chile relleno and a plate of two cheese enchiladas one with green sauce and one with red and two micheladas to wash it down :) Needless to say I left happy and full!"}
{"text":"Has anyone seen the South Park episode where Cartman goes to \"Casa Bonita?\" Well, this place is the same thing, just with no tall diving board or pool. That would be cool though.   Lindo Michoacan sits a top a hill that has a great view of the Las Vegas strip from Henderson. Seriously, fantastic view of the strip and even more awesome at night. I came here on a suggestion from a friend and decided to bring the entire family along. First off, this place is huge; tall ceilings, large dinning area, and a large bar with a window view. Lindo is also very loud with live music playing and giant bells ringing (reminding you there's a birthday happening with 50 feet), plus there are kids everywhere. Kids are usually a red flag for me to turn and run out, but I had about eight people with me so escape was not an option.  We sat down and immediately ordered table-side guacamole and margaritas. They have two versions; spicy and regular, we ordered two of each and we're amazed to watch two servers on each end of the tables churn out this green pile of goopy goodness. By the way, you automatically get chips, salsa, and bean dip at your table when you sit down. I lived in SoCal for quite awhile and was privy to a lot of guacamole and Lindo ranks at the top of my guac loving tastebuds. My favorite was the spicy version; great flavor, creamy with crunchy texture, and just enough spice. Highly recommended!   There were a lot of dishes going on at this table, but let's focus on me because...well just because. I ordered the Chili Verde Pork plate; it was both fantastic and huge! This plate is made up of pork that is slow cooked in a green chili sauce for hours until it pretty much melts in your mouth. The pork was super tender and also came with homemade flour tortillas.These were perfectly chewy and soft. I rarely can't finish my meal, but I was stuffed by the fourth bite. Yay, for midnight snacks!   The service here was impeccable and the atmosphere was fun. Great place for families and a possible low-key date night. I might be back for few a cocktails and sunset view of the Strip."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the restaurant. It was a pleasant surprise. We were driving around looking for a restaurant and tada! We saw this one. We went in and the wait was only about 15 minutes. We were told that we could order drinks and have them in the waiting area which is just in front of the restaurant.  Once we were seated, we had great service. The server even brought soup for my friends baby. Granted, the baby is too young but it was a sweet gesture.  The Flautas are incredible and a very large amount.  No complaints. Wish I lived closer so I could make this my regular restaurant!"}
{"text":"Lindo has never disappointed.  Plenty of chips, bean dip and salsa when you sit down. I always order the bacon wrapped shrimp, which is excellent and recommend to everyone but on this visit I ordered something more traditional.Today I stepped out of the box and ordered the Fajitas de Res.  Muy Bueno!  The beef,peppers and onions were great.  They used to provide more  flour tortillas but on this order there were two, and they will give you more if you ask. The tortillas were fresh. All the flavors were good, not too salty but just right.  The order comes with rice, refried beans, which were really good, plus a tablespoon of sour cream and guacamole.  For under $20.00 you can not but leave full.  The tables were clean, and a little dark inside at the booths. (That makes it hard to read the menu). The staff were courteous and the service was pronto.  From the time you place an order it arrives within fifteen minutes.    On this visit they did not bring their opener of a Fideo Soup cup, I didn't know if that is something they no longer do but I didn't miss it since I don't think it was meal stopper.  Over the years of going to any Lindo I have never been disappointed.  I recommend to all for its' value and good food."}
{"text":"What you get here is a million dollar view of the valley with sightly less food value. Yes the food is OK, what is memorable are the chips, salsa and the favorable bean dip served quickly when you are seated. The menu is overwhelming and takes a while to absorb. The wait staff is professional and attentive. The food portions are good, but the food is average at best. My son had the Fried Garlic Snapper and said it was very bland and had no garlic taste. My wife had Carnitas and said she had better. I came out on top with the Pork Chop dish (Can't even give the Mexican name) which had an excellent sauce. However, the rice and bean sides were bland and ordinary, the bean dip was better tasting. I have had better refried beans at places like Fausto's. The Spanish rice was dry and flavorless. Deserts were wonderful, the flan was tasty and very creamy, everyone liked the  cake. Go here for the ambiance and view and don't have great expectations for the food."}
{"text":"Legit authentic Mexican food.   Fast service - we literally Uber there and back in 1 hour from the strip - including dinner.  The red salsa is very good and just spicy enough to keep you dipping.  I especially liked the verde.   After my friend recommended it I asked the taxi line steward .. he vouched for it as well.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Great Margaritas!  Be careful not to fill up on chips, salsa and bean dip before dinner.  For some reason, this place is always slammed. I definitely recommend going here early. Service is great!  They have lots of servers and people refilling waters and removing plates, etc...  Went on a Friday night and there was a full on mariachi band playing. So, if you are looking for a quiet meal... it's not going to be here. This place is fun and loud. Their menu offers LOTS of options.... Chicken, beef, pork, fish, etc... I always have a hard time deciding what I want. And I usually take home half of what I order because their portions are large and after the chips, salsa and bean dip, I'm mostly full when dinner arrives. All entrees are served with rice and beans. And if you get something that comes with flour or corn tortillas... oh man... hard to choose.  Their corn tortillas are not the usual dry corn tortillas.  Their corn tortillas are AWESOME.  But then so are their flour tortillas.  But because I don't get to enjoy corn tortillas like theirs... I usually get the corn.  I highly recommend the corn tortillas... Get Them and Taste the difference.  All corn tortillas should be like this.  :)"}
{"text":"We came here for an early father's day dinner. The first thing we encountered was a breathtaking view of the strip and downtown through the massive wall size windows. You can sit at the bar and have a fantastic view facing the strip or asked to be seated on the lower level for a birds eye view of the strip and the old Vegas strip.     Once you are seated prepare for some live music from a guitar picker playing to a track not far from your table. The songs were all in Spanish, but it wasn't hard to pick out an Elvis or Sinatra tune from the playlist, which made the whole experience fun and unique.      The service at Lindo's is excellent. They have the model correct. In addition to the table server, there is a food runner and separate drink runners. The result is someone returning to your table about every 5 minutes to bring appetizers, drink refills and the food/dessert order.       The menu is a little hard to understand if you don't know Spanish, but it's a small mis-step in the overall experience. One thing that I noticed that was a little odd is that all of the management, kitchen cooks and floor servers were male. There wasn't one female on the floor besides the two hostesses that were greeting guests at the front door. I assume that this is the format in a traditional restaurant in Mexico.      Everything was Perfecto from our first impression to the server Jorge shaking my hand at the end of our experience. For tasty Mexican food and excellent service, go to Lindo's in the heart of Henderson. We will be back many more times"}
{"text":"Can I give this place 6 stars? Easily the best Mexican food in Vegas. Well worth the 15+ min drive off the strip to visit. Colorado green chili burrito, tamales, tacos all authentic and well prepared. Great drink menu, fast service and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is poor. They have wheat in everything! Including the salsa??? The beans?? The fajita I was able to eat could only be joined by watered down bottled hot sauce. I just can't believe the prices with the quality of food. Will not be trying this place again any time soon."}
{"text":"This place sucked the service sucked. The food was bland. Wish they weren't afraid to add seasoning to there food. The sad part about the service was that the manager took are order and yet still didn't come out right. I'd avoid this place. If your looking for real mexican it's not here"}
{"text":"I don't eat too much Mexican food but the menu sounded pretty good so we decided to give it a shot. Food was good but service was better! I tried the chicken but despite it's compelling description, it just tasted like chicken in tomato sauce. The chicken wasn't too dry, yet not particulary moist either.  The seats were comfy, there was live entertainment, so the atmosphere was nice and comfy. My overall experience was nice, I think it's partially due to the servers being super attentive and accommodating. :)"}
{"text":"Ask to sit where there is a view! You can see the whole strip while you enjoy dinner. The food was really good, the menu breaks it down so even if you don't know much about Mexican cuisine it's easy to choose. Service was great too, they were very attentive."}
{"text":"From LA and was recommended to eat here by several friends. Wow! Best mexican meal ever! Need this place back home. The staff was fantastic and on their game the whole time! Juan Carlos was our host and made our dining experience incredible, what a professional! Now to the food! I dined with 5 family members and we were all blown away! We all had various dishes from basic fare to seafood and none disappointed. The tamales were the best i ever had, so moist they melted in my mouth. So many good things to say about this place! YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE! 10 stars!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant. The colorful tile, the fountain, the artwork, the stained glass window... Very authentic. Guacamole made fresh and to order at the table. The homemade tortillas were hot and delicious. We had attentive service for our group of 10 during lunch rush- they even let us order on separate checks. Food was served quickly and to order. Drinks were refilled often.The employees seemed to really enjoy working there. I saw a place for a live band and a very well stocked bar.. I will be back to enjoy that!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I visit Vegas quite a bit and usually eat along the strip but decided to try a local place. It was a good choice. Food was delicious and very big portions for the cost. Staff was beyond friendly and the service was great. My cup never reached empty before the waiter was there refilling it. Oh and since it was my birthday they sang to me and I got some churros and a free shot! I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The Mexican spot to eat in Vegas.  Can't go wrong with Fajitas. Steaming and Sizzling to order."}
{"text":"Delicious food. I got the carnitas and couldn't be happier. I also don't even like guacamole but couldn't resist their tableside-made guac."}
{"text":"I havent been to the old Lindo but the west location (which I visited recently) was very nice. We had chips, salsa & bean dip (salsa & bean dip was OK) to start and followed that with the soup (soup was delish). Our main entree's were enchilads (one green - one red) and there were exceptional. There was live music (would have preferred not). Worth visiting for sure."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican Restaurant!! The view is spectacular overlooking the Vegas valley! The specialty margaritas are wonderful, the antojitos sabrosos and the main courses leave you stuffed wishing you could consume more. The parking is awful though. For a restaurant that size, they should have more parking.  We have to park down the street and walk downhill. This is a real pain."}
{"text":"Out of all their locations, the original is truly the best.  The service is on point and the food is fantastic.  Nothing came out greasy or under seasoned.  Our drinks were never half empty.  I would drive from across town just to eat here when I crave Mexican food."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and musica.  I went in on a Friday night for dinner and it was a packed house.  The food was super delicious. I ordered a carne asada burrito, which by the way was HUGE! The meat was so good, it was some good ol' steak without the fat, which was awesome.  If you're ever in Vegas and want some authentic Mexican food, try Lindo Michoacan.   Only one con, the horchata is fake. I only drink REAL horchata but other than that, excellent."}
{"text":"I love their bacon wrapped shrimp. Fideo soup was the bomb.The margaritas are delicious! The service was great! Came to celebrate my birthday and was surprised with a song by their mariachi and two complimentary shots of tequila! The view of the Vegas strip was my favorite. I do recommend their fried ice cream. I"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the view.  Go at anytime to get a good view of Las Vegas.  The food is ok.  I think it is a bit overpriced.  Service is usually good.  I have had authentic Mexican food many times and this is far, far from the best I have ever had.  I have yet to find a Mexican place in Henderson that was really worth it...I'll keep looking and let you know..."}
{"text":"if you are looking for Americanized Mexican food with a tourist environment then this is the place for you...they use high quality ingredients which is worth mentioning and really the only reason I gave it five stars because honestly I'm not into tourist places"}
{"text":"We came here for a late lunch and this place was packed! It is a huge restaurant that has space for large parties and even has a large patio area. The bar is quite big with a ton of liquors and beer selection and tvs to watch the games on.   When you are seated, they bring you chips, a side of beans, and salsa. The beans were amazing, probably the best re-fried beans I have ever had. I liked that they did a little  more than just the chips and salsa, it was a nice touch. The salsa was really good too, you could tell it was homemade and not the crap out of a jar.  The menu had plenty of options, and everything looked so good it was hard to decide what to order. I ordered a combo that came with a tostada, enchilada, taco, and chili rellano. It also came with beans and rice. It was way too much food, but everything was delicious. We had a few margaritas as well, and they were good and had just the right amount of tequila.  Our server was extremely friendly and the other staff were super nice and actually seemed like they liked their jobs and were happy to be waiting on us. The ambiance is casual and authentic.   Great authentic Mexican food, with great margaritas, and great service!!!!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite.   With that being said, the place is really authentic ole school Mexican. The service is very fast and efficient. We had no less than 4 different people bring drinks, food, clear plates. Impressed.   Food:  the server suggested the Tia Esther- I had with chicken. Thought it was going to be spicy- nope. It was ok. The beans are ok as well. I did like that a scoop of Guac came with the plate. My husband had the Colorado burrito and added onions. very tasty- the meat was chunky not ground or shredded.   House margaritas were good- most house margs are made with lots of sour mix- not these. Felt they were the 'skinny' marg. tasty."}
{"text":"Best service I've had in a long time!! Delicious food, get the guacamole and great prices."}
{"text":"As usual, this place always delivers good food! Enchiladas, tamales, chips, salsa...whatever I have ever gotten has always been great. The rice is a good blend and the fideo soup that is served pre-entree is always delicious. We got desserts on our last visit, and those were SSOOO good! The churros, lava cake, and the sopapillas (sp?)  were yum!"}
{"text":"Good food and amazing customer service!! Love the music and the decorations, made me feel if i was at Michoacan. Prices are a little bit high but its worth it. I really love it,best Mexican food i had ever eaten!"}
{"text":"It is a popular place, but plan on waiting outside as there is barely room for waiting guests inside. The hostess was taking a phone order when we arrived- she was very detailed and patient with the caller, which is nice but caused a backup of people wanting a table. Once seated however, the waiter was friendly, attentive, and really knew the menu. The food is standard Mexican, with fresh ingredients and good sized portions. I had a skinny margarita, and enjoyed it. The seating is a bit cozy and was full of families so it was noisy, but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fun to take the family, great food for a great price.  Wonderful atmosphere.  My favorite mexican restaurant in vegas."}
{"text":"Been so busy lately, I get to review now.  We love Lindo Michoacan. We just ordered some snacks for the NASCAR race we had recording. Chips and salsa (plus we order the extra hot habanero too). The tableside guac is awesome too and to go is just as good. I told them we like it spicy and that's what we got. I ordered some ceviche with no tostados (I already had chips) with extra avocado. It was so fresh and the avocado couldn't have been greener or riper!  My hubby got a couple tacos and an enchilada and that was probably better eaten there but, still good. The people are always nice and welcoming too. Great place!"}
{"text":"Service was wonderful! Margaritas are awesome. Salsa is ok.... My husband got a pork dish and it was yummy. Cooked perfectly. I got the shrimp chimichanga and it was horrible. Shirmp was wayyy over cooked and the pico filling was gross. I'm willing to give the place another chance."}
{"text":"Waiting time is on base of privilege - could be money, friendship or \"Mexican mafia style\". Defenetly, I did not recommended at all. This is just to start! Overpricing food. They can't handling a customer care. Means they doesn't care customer. Period!"}
{"text":"Solid, bustling local Mexican restaurant. Big place, with a great view. Guacamole freshly made at the table. Service solid too."}
{"text":"Went there with my family from out of town and all the food was cold. The food didn't have enough sauce and the  cheese was not melted. We were very disappointed and then to top it all off they charged my debit card 3 times for the exact same amount and when I called the manager be said that they only charged it once therefore I had to work with my bank to get it credited back. Never goung there again."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Food is good, excellent guacamole and fish tacos (choose the fried fish option), and the staff are perfect. You cannot beat the view!"}
{"text":"It was OK as Mexican food goes.  But the salsa tasted like it came from a jar.  Prices seemed a notch higher than most similar places like Frank & Fina's.  I might try it again though."}
{"text":"I had my wedding reception on April 18th and I cannot thank the wonderful staff enough for their service! the environment, food, music was outstanding!! We will definitely come back the next time we visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, Amazing food, Beautiful view. The tortillas where so fresh too!"}
{"text":"I always come to this place when I want to show friends a nice dinning experience. Staff is very friendly and attentive, I notice that the bussers are most attentive than the actual server which is a shame. Food prices are decent but seafood is a bit on the pricey side. Great place to come here on a birthday free tequila shot and the band comes over to your table and plays! The view they have of the strip is spectacular."}
{"text":"Tourists!! There are gems to be found outside of the glittery Strip... and some of these gems have shuttles! Hence, Lindo Michoacan, five stars for you. First of all, quick service with a smile always goes a long way with me. Secondly, chips and salsa AND bean dip to start off... win. Thirdly, tableside guacamole spiced to your preference? Getouttahere. Fourthly, a menu with something delicioso for EVERYONE, including us vegheads. Fifthly (not even a word), the fact that they had a full house and could still capably handle the group of 18 that we were in... seriously en pointe service. Drinks refilled in minutes, orders placed in front of you instead of called out (one of my huge pet peeves) and never felt pressured to get out once the check was presented. Take advantage of the shuttle situation and GO!!"}
{"text":"Birthday shot of tequila gratis! And oh yea, the food is good."}
{"text":"So looking forward to this dining experience last evening...had been recommended by several folks in person and the reviews on Yelp only pumped up my taste buds more...  If this is Las Vegas Mexican food at it's best then someone needs to have their head examined....it was downright BLAH.  Chips and salsa up front was nice touch but Salsa nothing special. Beans were nice free touch too but tasted like straight out of a can. We had several palate's to please. picky 15 year old, 18 year old who loves fish and anything fresh, your texmex appetite and mine who embraces any different, fresh or just darn good food.  How can you mess up a plain chicken quesadilla... two bites and 15 year old  was done...tasted it and couldn't agree more. Shrimp enchilada sounds good and as there was so much shrimp on the menu you figured it was a easy home run. Chewy and fishy covered in a plain sauce...18 year old didn't get through a 1/4 of it and others at the table agreed. Chicken Enchilada, come on how easy is that...apparently not to easy! Barely passable and again just plain. I had the 3 pork chops, Chuletas was the dish name, marinated overnight in a secret sauce. Don't bother, chops dried out and the sauces only secret is that it smothered the pork chops in something I would only describe as tasteless.  The service here was excellent (besides 3 requests for water) and can't fault them in this regard. Almost all the people in their, both small and large parties seemed to be celebrating a birthday party and it was just way to loud. WARNING sign - they listed fish on the menu but all they had were shrimp. This leads me to believe they do not shop fresh produce, how can you not have fish tacos on the menu!!! Come on and yes this only dawned on me after.  We finished our meal and probably returned the food about 75 - 80% untouched. There was an apology from the waiter but no manager to come and ask why, no credit on the bill... NOTHING.  We left our tip and were out of there and likely to never return...$100 down the drain.  I am rarely this bad when writing reviews but when you have options like Mundos in town and Don Juan for texmex/fresh food then I would recommend you steering clear of this over rated Mexican establishment.  Sorry Lindo..."}
{"text":"Saturday 12-19-15, reservation's for 20 people. Rehearsal Dinner, made 30 days earlier and confirmed day of the reservation. Beyond epic fail. Sat down at 9:15pm while watching Management allowing there Friends and Family members. What a joke. ZERO Management Skills. Owners should look into management on shift that night. What a bunch of jokers. Doubt we will be back. Food has always been great and is why we choose this establishment. What a shame. Please correct your management issues with not following protocol. Shame Shame Shame"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of favorite Mexican restaurants in town and has been for years. I usually start with a Cadillac margarita... It's the way to go. I've tried the regular margaritas and they're pretty weak... Love the flavored ones as well but again weak. Great chips and salsa comes with a bean dip as well. As far as food I always order the green cheese enchiladas (#14) so yummy! One thing I don't like is that my fideo soup which comes with my food always gets to the table at the same time my dinner does. Big no no and honestly it's annoying. The last time I was there I had to remind the server about the soup after our meal was already brought to the table. Ugh... honestly I shouldn't have to do that. That's one reason for the 3 star instead of 5. Another big one is....I have noticed that the service there is not as good as it used to be back in the day at the desert inn location. Seems like the servers want you to order...eat and leave. They want to turn tables. I get it more money. As a customer's i do not want to get rushed or feel like I'm not wanted there. Please management change this. Customer service is everything!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic authentic Mexican restaurant. They create an atmosphere with nice decor, live music, and great service. I recommend calling in ahead of time and making a reservation for the seats next to the windows with a strip view. Get there around sunset for a breathtaking view and a great meal!"}
{"text":"Great ambience a little too crowded but that alone says a lot of the place :) waiting time was an estimate of 30 mins for a party of two (too long) we decided to wait next thing you know it only took 10 mins to be seated (thumbs up) to drink I ordered a blue margarita on the rocks it wasn't too strong but I could taste the right amount of tequila in it!  chips and salsa were delicious! Had our fideo soup which was great not too salty like other places! For dinner I ordered Enchiladas de Mole! To be honest those were some really good enchiladas! Loved the mole sauce you can actually taste the home made sauce that makes it authentic! For dessert we ordered a Flameado now that was pretty cool! It's ice cream in flames! Be careful and make sure to blow it! :) we Would definitely be back as it's a great place to socialize and hang out with friends or family!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas I look forward to this place. Amazing service and food. 5 stars is not enough!!!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today for a friend's birthday. The restaurant sits on the corner and is hard to miss. The parking lot was a little cramped.  Upon entry the atmosphere was very inviting and felt authentic with a warm and spacious ambiance.  There was seating on the patio, the main dining room and a room towards the back surrounded by windows. We were seated in the back room with a great view. I would suggest visiting as the sun sets the view of the strip,  and mountains would be amazing.  The service was great from some and lacking by others. The receptionist was not very friendly and pretty much ignored us until a manager asked if we had been helped. Our waiter didn't seem interested in answering any of our questions about items. We had to ask him several times about menu items. He actually told me to hurry up and order. Other staff though we're very nice and offered suggestions as most of us had never visited before. My water was frequently refilled as we're the chips, refried beans and salsa which are complimentary. In addition my friend appreciated the staff coming out and singing to her for her birthday as well as the shot and  churros she was served.  The margaritas were the highlight of our visit. They were very sweet but I like sweet drinks.I also enjoyed the Pina Rita it had just the right amount of everything. The food arrived quickly once we ordered. The portions were very generous. I ordered pork tacos with rice, beans and avocado. It was good, not spectacular. The birthday girl ordered and loved the steak fajita served on a sizzling skillet with lots of peppers and onions. Others in our group said the food could have used more seasoning. Taste is subjective though, some like it hot, others not. Overall though everyone enjoyed the meal with minor complaints .   Overall the experience was a good one. The view the ambiance and the margaritas and food made up for the lackluster service and average food.."}
{"text":"very good food, great view, open till 2am!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Great service and food!  It's hard to find a true Mexican restaurant.  This is my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered the guac for starters.  Its made right in front of you and you can have them spice it up to your liking.  Delicious!  Tortillas are made in house and you can watch them being made right in the dining area.  Taco shells had maybe the best flavor and crispiness of any taco i've ever had.  Top notch mexican food not far off the strip.  Go there now!"}
{"text":"One star for the wait staff who were totally on top of everything and very friendly (no star for the four hosts who just stared at us blankly as we entered the restaurant)! One star for the gorgeous views. And one star for the live entertainment (a guy with an awesome voice). The ambiance is really great but honestly...the food was horrible. I got a combination plate of an enchilada, green chile burrito and a chicken taco and my boyfriend got the chicken fajitas. All of the accompanying spices and sauces were just too sweet. The soup was overly salted, the beans had no flavor. The tortilla chips were burnt and too thick. The prices are a bit high for the food but I would totally be ok with paying it for the view, if the food actually tasted good :( . So sad because I really love the view and just moved close by."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! So convenient, great atmosphere and the margaritas are so delish!!! They immediately give you chips, salsa and bean dip before ordering and are super fast with delivering the meals and drinks (a lot of other restaurants can learn a thing or two from them). HIGHLY recommend it. The view of Vegas is gorgeous too!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is fantastic, the views of Vegas from on top of the hills are a major plus to have for this restaurant as well. I had the tamale and enchilada combo plate and the food was spot on and tasty. Combos are reasonably priced and service was very friendly and prompt. Will be back in the future."}
{"text":"This in my favorite Mexican resturant, the fresh guacamole is the best in town.  I usually go for one of the combination plates but their steak cilantro and coca-cola carnitas are also an excellent choice."}
{"text":"Went here last Sunday morning, I've been to the other michoacan on sunset and always liked it. Didn't realize there was a location so close to me until seeing it on yelp. My gf had a craving for chilaquiles so we decided to give try this location out.          We went her brother, his gf, and their uncle. The girls got the chilaquiles, the brother and I had the menudo, uncle had some shrimp dish. We also had a couple bloody Mary's and some horchata. The menudo was good, it had a nice clean flavor and wasn't gamey at all. Chilaquiles were ok and shrimp was just ok too. Everything seemed to be a little bland and we need to use a lot of condiments to add some spice. The bloody Mary's had great flavor but I would prefer them a bit stronger since they were $10 each.        Overall it was ok but I enjoyed the other location we tried a little more. The service was decent except it took them like 15 mins to run our cards after we got the bill. Value is not that great, our bill was a little over $100 for some basic Mexican fare. Probably won't be back anytime soon, would rather drive a bit for better cheaper Mexican."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. We were able to get seated right away. Staff were nice and friendly.  My husband ordered the menudo and I ordering four different kinds of tacos. The menudo has lots of meat but the tacos was just simple, hardly any favor but they did packed a lot of meat."}
{"text":"It's too bad with so few good Mexican restaurants, what passes for good now is just very ordinary. The food at Lindo is plentiful on the plate and not outrageously priced... it's just that it does not make you say, I must return here.  For folks in Henderson, it's a long trip up to the World Market Center, but that's where you'll find interesting and very creative Mexican fare... at  Mundo Restaurant. ..(moving from their previous location over on Ft Apache, wish they decided to come to Henderson instead). http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2010/apr/14/viva-el-mundo/"}
{"text":"Do not recommend this place what so ever.  Not really Mexican food.  very disappointed! First off chips, salsaand canned beans. Over price with nasty food.  My sis had a chicken with nopales chicken had a smell and a nasty taste, told server and did nothing about.  HORRIBLE PLACE, WILL NEVER GO BACK!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so so so good!! Clean and has great service!!! Will be back every time I'm in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times and keep going back because I love the view, the fresh guacamole and the Mexican Elvis who sings La cuccharracha.  But it's overpriced and the Mahi Mahi, is awful! I suspect it was expired cod, gross!"}
{"text":"Ok tengo q empezar con que este lugar me ENCANTA por las salsas, el consome y las chips que te dan al principio. Es la Primera vez q este lugar me desoluciono con mi Plato favorito BIRRIA.. Me trajeron mi Plato y yo como ni√±o con Juguete Nuevo x comer alfin mi platillo :-/ me Doy cuenta al empezar a provar mi BIRRIA que CASi CASi era pyro consome lo q me sirvieron.. Estaba dificil encontrar la carne :-( jajajajaja les pedi al mesero q por favor me pusiera mas carnita, ni modo con la Pena.. Lo IMPORTANTE q de todos modos celebramos agusto.. Ala proxima MEJOR no pido BIRRIA y MEJOR me como otro Rico platillo d Los q preparan AQUI :-)     Ok have to start with I LOVE THE CHIPS AMD SALSA, But unfortunate I had a very bad experience when ordering my favorite dish BIRRIA. I was very disappointed because I had to move my spoon in order to see my meet! I had to ask my waiter to please ask the chef if he could put some more meet in my BIRRIA.! Next time I would just order another dish that I know are always good :-)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the one in Henderson is was better, especially when it comes to the service provided.  The service was slow and the waiter/bussers couldn't even be bother to say excuse me when grabbing the water to refill your cup or taking the plates away.   The food was not as bad but it lacked in flavor, you could tell something was off. The best thing was the chicken, the sauce tasted bland. Rice was completely dry and missing any sign of Mexican rice."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here, especially the city view. My only wish is that they had better salsa. They serve bean dip and a red sauce that tastes less flavorful than plain enchilada sauce. That being said, Casa Don Juan just opened on Sunset. Their salsa is AWEsOME"}
{"text":"I'm not good at writing very long drawn-out reviews every little smell and salt and whatever else there is to write about all I can say is this place has excellent food the chips and dips  are  delicious .. tableside guacamole is awesome....everything was so good ...my wife had tamales and fish tacos and not one complaint..  everything  it great....its all fresh delicious the service is good it's a very good place for Mexican there many choices in Vegas this is definitely one of the best"}
{"text":"Really very good Mexican food!! They bring you out chips, salsa and beans so you don't have to pay for chips n salsa (a bonus in my book) the food was really great, they have great ingredients and tasty sauces. This was my first time there and I was impressed! They are a tad on the expensive side for me though, most of their items ranged from 15 and up, which I was a little shocked at. They do have cheaper items if you are interested. All in all great food!"}
{"text":"Great view of the strip (you're up high). Large menu with choices for everybody. Inexpensive lunch menu with a great number of entrees all of which includes a soft drink. Strolling musicians at dinner hour. Family owned, I've never had a bad meal there. Great service too."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this restaurant to me for a quick lunch.  It did not disappoint, although the \"over the top\" decor and piped-in music brought back memories of being at Epcot in Florida.  Great portions, good value and excellent service.  If these are your keys to a great dining experience, then you've found Lindo Michoacan in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about this place, so I had to try it. I WILL say the view is amazing and I appreciated there was live music (even though it didnt start until the end of the night at the end of our dinner). I felt the food I ordered was bland and the soup reminded me of knorr soup packets. There was just that extra flavor missing and I didnt feel it was better than any other mexican food place, at least what I was served. We had an AMAZING bus boy as he brought everything for us, asked how things were, and filled drinks. Our server was only seen once, to take our order. I also felt rushed."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican restaurant with a great view of the Las Vegas strip. I have not had anything to eat here that I didn't enjoy. From burritos to tacos, and even classy-er dishes..... This place hits the spot. Great service from the 3-4 guys that wait on you. As far as margaritas are concerned, I go Cadillac all the way. They introduced another drink I am extremely fond of: the Mexican bull dog. This isn't a cheap drink by all means, but provides some much needed refreshment in the desert. It's an upside down corona extra in a Cadillac margarita. Overall great restaurant, and my number one choice for such in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food & service!   Been there several times & will definitely go back.   Drinks are refreshing.  Staff is very friendly & quick to be served.   Food is always hot & in all the times we have been there, never had anything less than superior service & food."}
{"text":"Was there around 2pm... chips, salsa and beans tasteless....  I ordered a beer and some food. By the time the beer was 2 third down I was asked if I wanted another one (????)... huh... ok....  why not? Usually, I finish one before I get another, but what the heck. Came 2nd one. I finish my food, I'm wiping my lips, beer is barely started, boom, she gives me the check. WTF? Where's the fire? Why pushing people out? It's Friday afternoon, relax time.... had another drink...  friend of mine joined me ... we left to Chili's... better chips and salsa, better margaritas and nicer staff.... 1st and last time for me at LM."}
{"text":"My opinion changes for the best everytime I go into this restaurant. The very first time I ate there I ordered this \"goat soup\" which its main ingredients are goat and beer. It was not appetizing at all! To each their own though. The last few times I dined there I was pleasantly please with the service, the the time it took for the food to arrive and the food itself. There are only a few good Mexican restaurants in town I enjoy going to and this is one of them."}
{"text":"Um, clearly many of you have never had real Mexican food.  My best friend raved about this place ever since I told her I was moving to Vegas from California and needed to discover new Mexican restaurants to help curb my insatiable craving. She mentioned how much she loved Lindo so I gave it a shot -- but girl you are trippin'.  Lindo Michoacan is overpriced, bland, and flavors were just flat out weird. The salsas lacked that kick that I love and expect from freshly made salsa. The decor was a chain restaurant nightmare. However portions were big if you like that kind of thing and the view is quite beautiful.   The search for delicious Mexican food in Vegas continues! (Please, any suggestions are welcome!)"}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant in Vegas ! Been going here for years. Big portions, good service and really great food. Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"The food is good but not exceptional.  You come for the view mostly which is spectacular, even better than Ventanos down Horizon Ridge.  I can walk here and mostly do, due to the parking issue."}
{"text":"There food was ok.  Wasn't really impressed.  We felt like we went to a chain.   They were very busy and their service was fast but food was just ok.  They need more of a homemade touch."}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times. We also do take out for staff lunches here as well. The food is always good and they have great service too. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"the restaurant is located up on a hill overlooking Las Vegas with a distant view of The Strip.Yes the best seats are behind the main bar and down a couple of stairs where the tables are right next to the full length picture windows.  The food is exceptionally good and the drinks are generous.  You will always find a birthday or special event group inside as this place is great.  The portions are large so order accordingly."}
{"text":"Great location with awesome valley views, especially on clear days! Fun and festive atmosphere but a little too loud for any meaningful conversation. Food was great; lots of menu choices and amazing guacamole made table side. Great service too! Just too loud!"}
{"text":"AMAZING Mexican restaurant off the strip! Warning.. They have so many good things on the menu I ordered enough to feed a family because I couldn't decide. Walking in we were greeted by every employee along the way and felt so welcome it immediately or a star! We started with the guacamole made fresh, table side and it was very good! They also serve you fresh salsa and a bean dip with chips complimentary. They also start you off with a traditional Mexican soup ( just like grandmas house in Mexico  is what I was told) that I have never experienced before but fell in love right away! I even pinned a recipe right at the table because I wanted to know how to make it. It was a lighter tomato soup with very thin noodles that I could picture myself eating with grilled cheese..yum! So back to this delicious meal... I ordered the chicken chimichanga and it was absolutely huge! Had I known I would have shared it but hey more for me! For dessert we tried the fried ice cream that had a pleasant surprise of caramel on top instead of the traditional chocolate sauce on the east coast. All of the employees were very helpful making sure drinks were filled and plates were cleared timely and most important were very grateful we decided to dine with them. I would definitely go back here and would also recommend it to anyone looking for some good Mexican!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Have heard mixed things from local friends, but for me all 5 stars! Superior service, quick food, great food! Love it! The vibe and all!"}
{"text":"Based on our acquaintance's raving recommendation,  a group of us had lunch at this joint the other day. What a disappointment.  Chicken in the taco was dry, bland, and tasted old. One friend's enchiladas showed up at the table plain with no sauce. She had to ask the waiter for the sauce.  Another friend's plate came without rice that was listed on the menu. The rice never came even after she asked the server.  I am done listing the negatives. The view from the restaurant is great if you don't mind bland food or pay for food you don't get. There are many good Mexican eateries in the Las Vegas Valley but Lindo is definitely not it."}
{"text":"This is a go to place in Las Vegas for Mexican food. It is close to my home. They always have available seating. They are fast courteous. They often have music live music playing. The food is excellent. I typically always get the pub Lanos. It is one of my favorites. But every meal I have eaten there has been great. So you cannot go wrong with this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was recommended here by a coworker, as I was here on business. The ambience is great, service was great, food was ok. I ordered the fajitas and the steak was really tough.. maybe a one off situation tho. I would try it again and go for another protein perhaps."}
{"text":"We ordered the steak nachos with the enchiladas, soft tacos, etc. We loved our food. Full of meat and cheese! With all this great food was exceptional service and reception. Good job, guys!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is great if you're looking for generic Mexican food.  This location is nice because it has outdoor as well as indoor seating.  If you like Mexican music, they have a traditional Mexican band in the evenings.  The food is good, the staff is friendly, and the restaurant is clean.  Nothing special, but fair value for the money."}
{"text":"Good food and decent service!! Not as good as Dona Marias or Phab Phranks for Mexican food but really good!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great Mexican food- the bean dip and homemade tortillas are my favorite! The view of the strip is great and the workers are a lively bunch! Great place to have a birthday dinner-they give you a sombrero, sing, and play the guitar!"}
{"text":"The original Lindo Michoacan has been around for a long time, and they have Mexican food down. Considering the owner is from Mexico and his soon attended culinary school, this restaurant has an amazing variety of Mexicans dishes and a service that never fails. Visit this place if your looking for authentic Mexican food and enjoy The love mariachi! The mariachi is amazing and the food is the best! Mariachi is there Friday and Saturday from 7:30-9:30."}
{"text":"This restaurant had very good Mexican food. We drove like 8 minutes away from the strip and it was worth it. The tortillas are hand made. The steak with the green sauce was super bomb. Also the service was great. We only waited like 5 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Wife and I split Nachos. Chips burnt, cold pickled jakapenos. Really. Have you ever ate charred peppers. Missed opportunity, and just a teaspoon of guac and sour cream on top. Had to pay for extra. Unseasoned. Small portion and very few pieces of bland chicken. Overpriced. Never going back. Sad because Vegas and Henderson are loaded with great Mexican reastaraunts. Lived here several years so we have lots of experience eating out."}
{"text":"First time visiting a Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas.  After living in South Florida and visiting a wide variety of Mexican restaurants I can say that Lindo Michoacan is definitely on par.   The food was great, service was great and the atmosphere was on point.  Will make sure to visit again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. My husband hates margaritas and he loves the mango margaritas!!! We are enjoying ceviche, table side fresh guac, beams, salsa, and we ordered. The portions are huge and I am excited to eat my leftovers. Yum! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It is rare that a man like Rex Marvin pays homage to anything...just the usual suspects...all nude circuses, bars with live sharks, and bring your own shotgun petting zoo's/butcher shops...you know...the true classics that deserve respect. I am not an animal, I know what really matters in this life.  Living in many facilities across the southwest I have learned the difference...the desire...the NEED for great Mexican food in any happy persons life.  Some poor souls go through their pathetic existence never realizing this need. Occasionally, these poor dumb bastards get a sudden sense something is wrong...something horribly terrible is wrong...that sudden cascade of fear...the wave of distress...they look for their keys, they call their love ones...everything seems fine...but it isn't...they have never had real authentic Mexican food!  I have spent many a night in Las Vegas...hung my head there many times. Always with a ton of money or no money. Always alone or with a woman who I pay by the hour. Regardless of my luck, regardless of my company...I always fill my aching head at Lindo Michoacan.    The carnitas are something that should be classified as a national treasure. The carne asada is rich, flavorful and exceedingly special. The Pollo Amador is ridiculously amazing. The Steak Ranchero is tender and well seasoned.  The Guacamole is...well...it is out of this world. It is one of the few guacamoles i would actually pay for. I always think you should make it at home, but this is the one exception to the rule.   There is one last thing I need to say.  The meals are great, the fried rice and refried beans are amazing...but the burritos are not great. They are very good, they are worth trying once...but they are not the best in town. I would stick to the meals.  Eat the food. Enjoy the hospitality. Always wear a hat at an all nude circus.  Thank Rex Marvin. You love him.  He would love you, but he can't love anyone."}
{"text":"Lindo Michoacan is a true authentic. Mexican restaurant. They make home made tortillas and guacamole.   They do not play with their margaritas. I had a mango margarita which I could not finish due to the amount of alcohol. I'm not a drinker so it hit be before my meal came out. I'm definitely not complaining, but be ready for it!   My husband had the traditional grilled chicken enchiladas and I ordered a chicken dinner off the specialty menu, which was amazing.   I give this place 2"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Still new to Vegas so we didn't have a Good Mexican restaurant out here but we have officially found our new favorite spot! This place was soooo good! And the live music was very good also he sounded very good it was very nice listening to:) I think the best was the amazing service it wasn't just your server it's everyone working as a team to make sure u were always taken care of which was so nice and very rare now days. Highly recommended everything about this place! It is absolutely great :)"}
{"text":"must haves: table side guacomole, Javiers's top shelf margarita, and the steak and lobster (if you are feeling fancy) or carne asada(every other 364 days of the year). We went for new years eve and ordered the steak and lobster...sigh. I was actually nervous ordering it from a mexican resturant but it was great. They can prepare it several different ways but we went with the waiter's favorite. Spicy and a new twist on a familar pairing made it reinvented completely. I have eaten there probably 100 times and if I can I will eat there 100 times more."}
{"text":"Jesus will eat here when he returns.  He probably eats here now; I certainly would if I could afford to sit for every meal.   Every employee with which we interacted was friendly. Service was fast. Jaime served us and made excellent recommendations. The place is nice and is clean. The location is unfortunate but not hazardous.   The food. Oh the food. The salsa was like sucking on a delicious curling iron; they aren't dumbing down the heat for tourists. The tableside guacamole had six or seven ingredients and renewed my love for it. I think every facet of the meal was homemade, from the tortillas to the enchilada sauce. The menu is extensive and obscure to this Tex-Mex aficionado, but I will return to try everything.   Makes me wish I had given fewer 5-star ratings to other establishments, cuz this one is truly in the top 1%"}
{"text":"food is always very good. ate here at least 20 times.   service can be fair to terrible, especially if you sit at the bar. I think they need a bartender who makes drink solely for the tables.  toreados are bomb"}
{"text":"I have waited 6 days to write a review as I wanted it to be objective and not emotional. I was invited to a party here.   The booking was for 25 people at 7pm. Those of us that arrived at 7pm were sat at a table with the Party Girl. As people arrived, it was clear there was no seating for them. The restaurant had sat us at a wrong table that wasn't large enough.   I offered to move as I am a work colleague and not family. I was squished in a small booth with 4 other people. We were given a plate of beans, some salsa and some chips and a few utensils. So now we are not on the main table, that's ok, the girls are fun.  I asked for water as soon as we sat down. It didn't come.   We were then moved to a table that was added on to the original table. I sat down, asked for water and they set the places. I had no mat and no fork. I asked for water again, it still didn't come.   Everyone was given a soup bowl apart from me. I ordered fajitas and when they came, had to find a fork to eat them with. I asked for water again and got a glass. I chose to eat the fajitas off of the skillet and leave the sides to take home to Larry.   I asked for another glass of water, it never came.   When the waiter came to clear my plate, I said to him I needed a box for the sides. He said 'are you finished?' And pointed to the skillet. I said yes but need a box for the sides. He picked up the sides and put them on a dirty plate. When I told him no, I want a box to take them home, he scolded me and said in a huff 'you said you was finished', I said yes I am but I made it clear from the off, I needed a box. I still didn't get a refill on the water.   So in summary, I sat at three different place settings, had two glasses of water in two hours, didn't have a place mat or fork, didn't get soup and got told off by the waiter at the end of the meal.   No, I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic, I have tried all the locations always the best service ... Great View of the City from the one in Henderson"}
{"text":"Josue is THE BEST server hands down. My friend and I come here for a happy hour every now and then on Fridays and he treats us SO well. The carne asada nachos are amazing and so are the Margs. Happy hour is kinda early from 2-5pm but well worth it!"}
{"text":"It was a very nice experience. Yes it was noisy and it a little crowded but very nice. The food was great! It is so far one of the best real Mexican restaurants I been to. Coming from a Mexican. :) The staff was very polite with my husband and I. They are very busy but when they came to talk to me they took their time they weren't rushing me they made feel important. Somebody was always checking on us to make sure we had drinks and to make sure we were satisfied and we were very satisfied! A little pricey yes, but very worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food, tasty margaritas and an outstanding view. Service is usually good but felt a little rushed a couple of the many times we've eaten here. Come at dusk for the view with an appetite and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"this place was good services was great! every waiter that would pass would be attentive, ambiance was great definitely coming backkkkk"}
{"text":"les recomiendo que salgan un rato del entorno de las vegas blvd y disfruten este restaurante, para mi el mejor que hemos visitado mexico de verdad, las pasamos super en semana santa del 2012, el domingo santo excelente hasta nos regresaron al hotel ya que eramos 8 personas."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant. For example I went with my family and once we ordered our food they kept asking if we wanted more food but we said no it was okay, about 10 minutes after we got our food they were basically kicking us out. And no there were not a lot of people waiting at the restaurant, most tables were empty. My mom was still eating her food when one of the hosts casually walked by and picked up her plate and walked off. She wasn't done eating nor did he ask her, he just picked it up, started speed walking and tried being smooth about it, which is extremely rude and not at all good customer service. The portions are small, the food arrives cold, it's overall just not that good."}
{"text":"My friend and I frequent here a couple times a year.  Not sure if today was a off day... the food was good,  but our waiter was horrible.   Barely could crack a smile,  was not attentive to us as customers.  Kinda almost rude.  Hope he was just having a off day,  but i almost just wanted to leave."}
{"text":"Food Poisoning. I used to love this place. Perhaps their good reputation made them complacent? Perhaps there are too many items on the menu (over 100!) for them all to be made fresh? Whatever the case, I ordered my favorite, Beef Mole Enchiladas, the center was a bit cool, but I plowed through it. Also had the fried ice cream- this was pre made, not fresh, horrible, this tasted old. I awoke at 3 AM shivering with flu-like symptoms. It gets R rated for horror from there. Never again."}
{"text":"Julio is a very bad server. He was not attentive and we had to ask everyone else for service because he was never around. This review gets one star for the buspersons and servers that waited on us throughout our dinner. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"I've frequented Lindo Michoac√°n many times with no complaints & rated them with high stars. Tonight was by far the worst experience I've ever encountered. According to Louis (shift manager) at the Desert Inn location, Lindo Michoac√°n requires the customer to provide I.D. with debit card purchases. I asked him why? He said, \"it's because the machines process debit cards as a credit card.\" I then told him that sounds like their problem, not the customers problem. I also told him debit cards do not require an I.D. due to the card requiring the customer to input the PIN # that signifies it's their card. I then asked him how would he handle the situation had we not provided an I.D. & he said, \"I don't know.\" However, he claimed they started this change in policy last month. As a manager you should have the skill set to problem solve & exceed the customers expectations. Not only did Louis have no answers, he was unable to come close to meeting my expectations. Therefore I will not frequent the restaurant anymore & I will ensure my friends & family are aware of the horrible experience that occurred."}
{"text":"I'd came here after work on a Friday with a group of people for I guess the happy hour. This place has awesome chip and salsa and bean dip. I got the virgin strawberry daiquiri. It was good. I don't know about the other drinks though. Seem liked people enjoyed them."}
{"text":"The food was great , the service was spectacular , i highly recommed this place . I ordered thr tilapia dish and it was SO GOOD . The servers were on top of everything . 5 stars all the way"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife on a Friday night, and the atmosphere was very lively, loud, and energetic. I felt like I was in a touristy part of Mexico. There was a good mix of people from all ethnicities and age groups, and there was also a mariachi band performing. They were entertaining to watch, but I felt bad for the table that had these trumpets blowin all up in their grill.  We started off with their complimentary chips and salsa. Also shared a mango margarita with my wife. I'm sure many people have experienced this, but I always get too stuffed from eating all the chips and salsa that I only end up eating half of my entree. The salsa and bean dips were really good, and the chips were hot and fresh. We also ordered a side of guac, and it was nice and chunky.   For the entree, I ordered the two taco combo with shredded beef. It was ok. Tasted just like Roberto's shredded beef taco but just less oily. My wife got the chicken taco and chicken enchilada combo, and besides the enchilada being a little too mushy, she enjoyed it.   Not the best Mexican food I've ever had but definitely one of the better Mexican restaurants that Vegas has to offer."}
{"text":"Good service, very tasty food, prices are reasonable. Walked right in on a Saturday evening and was seated quickly. It was busy but they were fast and the food was very good.  Try to get a seat with a view of the Strip, its a nice view from up on the hill."}
{"text":"The salsa was terrible, my chicken tacos were seasonless, and my friends beef burrito was terrible. I was so disappointed because the reviews for this place had been so great."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Every time I go to Vegas, I come here.  It's off the strip but great prices and food.  I highly recommend the drive!  Nothing at this place is bad."}
{"text":"For my last night in Vegas, I wanted something easy for my last meal with the extended fam before jetting back to OKC. Mexican was quickly agreed upon, and my aunt said immediately we had to go to Lindo Michoacan.   Needless to say, it was an excellent idea! The food was perfect. This was my first time to experience a bowl of refried beans along with the salsa for the requisite pre-dinner chips, which I loved. My aunt also insisted we order gaucamole, which is prepared table-side! It was so delicious. I opted for the shrimp fajitas with corn tortillas. The shrimp was very juicy and delicious. My family, usually a talkative bunch, were all so happily enjoying our food so much that it was a fairly quiet dinner.   The ambiance in here is also excellent--there was a guitarist both playing and singing. The decor was what you'd expect from a nice Mexican restaurant too. All of the servers were attentive and friendly too."}
{"text":"Last breakfast in Vegas and we were craving some authentic Mexican. Loved everything about this place. From the outside to the decor inside down to the \"uniforms\" the employees were wearing. Wait staff was very attentive and polite. Never had to ask for refills because they were on it! Dimly lit but recovering from a night out so it definitely helped. The chilaquiles were delicious and I was pleasantly surprised when after they took our drink order they brought out sopa de fideo! Took me back to days at my grandmas house! Family owned and run which I absolutely love. Will definitely be back when I return to Vegas for my next trip!"}
{"text":"This place has good authentic Mexican food. I have been to this location and the Original Lindo on the other side of town.   The comes with complimentary chips, salsa, and beans. The salsa has some kick to it. It's not my favorite type of salsa but it still good.   To drink I got the horchata. I love me some of that. It was a little bit watery for my liking but still refreshing. They were quick to refill my glass though which is always good.    I like to get their table side guacamole. It's fresh and delicious. If you like salt you will need to add some but I'm glad they don't over salt it.  This time I got the Chicken Flautas on flour tortillas. They give you 6 which is more than enough. They also come with a side of rice and beans. The rice and beans were alright. I have had better.    The service is usually excellent at both places. I give it a 4 because of the salsa. I love chips and salsa but this one doesn't make me want more."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Henderson! Incredible view of the city and great atmosphere. I had a delicious pork burrito & sangria! Great place to being friends and family when they come to :)"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Mexican place in Vegas. Courteous staff and great food everytime I go there. Never dissappointed. Love this place and always bring out of town friends/family here too"}
{"text":"This wonderful establishment just happens to be in our neighborhood, and we keep coming back for the delicious food, excellent service, and lively atmosphere! (We recently tried the popular El Dorado Cantina. My partner and I both agreed: LINDO is BETTER!!!!)"}
{"text":"It was my favorite restaurant, but today was the worst experience. The host role her eyes at me because from 8 peopel we go to 12. So we waited 30 min to get sat. We order food and my brothers soup was cold and my steak was buey  al cilantro and it was like with a white sauce and mushrooms wipe off and the green sauce just on top. Send it back came back in less then 5 min but it was medium and I was asking for medium well and the worst part it was the manager who took it back and bring it back. So I send it back again and I decide not to get it back because everyone was almost done. The same  manager came back to the table and she only said we're busy and we try to everything came out fast and good, but some times we miss some details. She don't said sorry, just said that she'll took it off of my check. Wow what a service. Sorry but I don't think we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent, Best Mexican Food in Las Vegas (authentic Mexican Food)  , Julio , Our Server was very Nice, our drinks on time, our food great, no mistakes. Very Good Guys!!!! we will came back soon. 100% recommend."}
{"text":"I'm upset for not taking a picture but I can justify by saying: It was delicious and I drank it all in a few gulps!    I asked my server (as I always do at many Mexican restaurants) if they serve a Banana Margarita. My server looked at me and said he will ask the bartender, as he winked his eye. He came back a few minutes later with a large glass and asked if they made it right. OMGGG! It brought me back to the first time I had it at a small mom and pop restaurant. Yes! I told him it was awesome and thanked him. After I was done, he brought me another one and told me it was on the house. He said maybe they will put it on the menu.  I hope they do!"}
{"text":"So my co worker and I looked at yelp while sitting at the table so we were already dedicated to our meal. We were greeted, sat, and attended to quickly.  Our waiter was great, watched him make guacamole at the tables, then our food came. I ordered the chilli colorado and she ordered a taco salad. The cook is amaizing as he figured out how to extract every bit of flavor from everything on my plate,  I could not even finish anything and I tried. This place has a great view,  but the food is horrible.  My co workers chicken on her taco salad tasted like they froze it, unthawed it, froze it again, un thawed it, scrubbed the toilet with it froze it and then cooked it untill it was as dry as he could get it, then he put it in one of the oiliest shells he could find. This was our first visit and on the way back to the office we stopoed at taco bell because we couldnt even finish our food.  At least the manager who didnt even come to the table gave our waiter permission to comp my meal. Needless to say I will never return to this establishment even if they are paying us to have a meal."}
{"text":"Love this place! My kids do too. They are always greeted with soup right away. Chips and bean dip are awesome. Had a carne asada taco, very tender and flavorful. All the kids had a bigger bowl of soup, it's their favorite."}
{"text":"Boasting some of the best margaritas in town, Lindo Michoacan caters to the locals of Las Vegas and Summerlin. Spacious seating and attentive servers allows this friendly Catina to accommodate both large and small groups well. There is daily live music although it is not the authentic  sound I would expect at a Mexican restaurant. This place is good, and I would  go back, but it will not know your socks off. You will leave satisfied but not blown away."}
{"text":"i really like lindo michoacan.  the chips they bring out are always fresh and are so addicting.  i love spicy food and they have a really good habanero sauce if you ask for it.  the sauce goes really well with the chips and bean dip.  also, their fideo soup is very good and unique.  i haven't been able to find that soup at any other mexican joints.  overall, this place is good food, fast and clean and has really good prices.  i used to come here a lot when i lived in the summerlin area."}
{"text":"I love Lindo's food, but the atmosphere is a tad kitsch. I know it's a Mexican restaurant, but it's a tad loud. The staff can be forgetful at times. Nevertheless, it's some of the best Mexican in the valley."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have had in a very long time! Everything we ordered was great and cooked right. It was so authentic and tasted very home made. Coming from CA we have eaten at many Mexican restaurants and I can honestly say this is by far our favorite and its not even in Cali. It even beats a couple of places we tried in San Diego. If I start reviewing each and everything we ordered this review will easily turn into a novel because I have nothing but great things to say about everything and no one will read it because its too long, so i'll just say go there and try it out yourself. You wont be disappointed. The food speaks for itself!"}
{"text":"We loved the Fideo! You get a small cup after you order. The chips are set at your table almost immediately wen you sit down. They have two dip options - refried beans, and a spicy red sauce.   There's a salsa that is SO HOT, there's a warning and a disclaimer! Your server might let you sample it if you ask nicely, though.   DELICIOUS plates, large portions, authentic decorations and chips to die for!  I'd go again."}
{"text":"Had dinner a few nights ago for the first time at Lindo Michocoan. I love the view (I went during the day so I'm sure at night the strip looks beautiful).  I ordered the tacos al pastor. They were delicious. My only complaint would be that they use corn tortillas to make it more authentic. I hate ordering tacos and getting them in flour tortilla.   I also ordered a margarita on the rocks and it was delicious. Nothing special that \"wow\" me but I enjoyed it. The alcohol didn't overpower it. So if you like strong drinks then you probably wouldn't enjoy it because you hardly taste the alcohol.   My husband ordered goat meat and I tasted his food and I must say I didn't really enjoy it at all. The texture was very chewy and lack seasoning.   Overall our Experience was pleasant and will be going back to try a few more things off the menu.   The fidello soup was helpful to keep my toddler entertained while we ate. He seemed to like it but he likes pretty much everything. I'm not a fan of fidello soup... Don't like it's flavor."}
{"text":"Pedi una platillo de chuletas con salsa d asiote q savia a puro vinagre con chile pero le comente al mesero y me sugerio ponerle salsa verde la verdad me lo soluciono la verdad ESA salsa Roja    fuera lo q Es la comida d bonito michoacan"}
{"text":"Great view and good food. I love their fresh tortillas. I've been here for nine years throughout all their locations. As for service, their staff are friendly. But sometime it take a while for the food to serve."}
{"text":"Eat here!  Coca-Cola Carnitas and Tacos Al Pastore amazing.  Novilla al cognac omg delish.  The service is also very outstanding."}
{"text":"This restaurant has one of the best waiter service ever. The waiter at my table was so nice and smiled a lot and he recommended some things to order. I ended up getting the birria which was delicious. If your in Vegas it's only 10 min away and you won't regret it. It was nice to the girls wearing their amazing Mexican dresses.

{"text":"Having grown up in New Mexico the. Lived in Phoenix for 18 years and now living in Seattle all I do is dream of amazing Mexican food. This place is amazing. OMG."}
{"text":"I'm not Mexican (really? yes really) so I have no idea if my authenticity gauge is accurate, but I do know that I have never had a bad meal at Lindo.  The chips & salsa are exactly what every Mexican place should serve, you can't go wrong with any of the entrees, and margaritas always leave me happy.  This is definitely the place to go if you're in Vegas and craving Mexican that isn't Strip-ified."}
{"text":"I had to give 3 stars because of our first waiter... JAVIER...   I came in yesterday for my bday dinner with my husband and we got sat in the nice view area. Everything started great until our waiter ignored us for 30 min, he passed by several time but did not look our way or ask us if we needed anything. He was busy with the large table next to us. I waived him down to grab an appetizer while we waited for the rest of our party.  Then when my family finally arrived they advised us there was no room to fit 6, so we said thats fine you can move us. Well the waiter wouldn't even address the problem to us the hostess and the bus boy had to speak for him while he stood behind us with a distasteful look on his face.  When we were finally moved the new waiter was much nicer, Rene. He actually acknowledged we there.   Other than the waiter situation, food is amazing, atmosphere is great. I'll be back just not with that waiter."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by a friend and we decided to try it. I've been craving good Mexican food for a long time. I wasn't disappointed, that's for sure, everything was so delicious.i have to say the best Chile relleno since i moved here from Colorado a little over a year ago. Not only the food but the west side of the restaurant is all windows. It's a beautiful view if the valley. We enjoyed our evening. We will definitely be back. I'm thinking the whole family on Christmas Eve. Making my reservation very soon. The staff is attentive and friendly. The bathrooms are very clean"}
{"text":"This review will be short and sweet.  Lindo Michoacan is a very average, non-unique, Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas.  It is as plain as you will get in offerings and flavors; meat, fajitas, tacos, beans, etc.  Nothing exceptional or out of the ordinary.  The prices are the usual for a sit down Mexican like this (around $12-$15 for a meal).  There are also some lunch specials for, I believe, under $10.  Overall, this restaurant can be skipped unless you are craving that Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"THE ONLY THING good about this place is the view, seriously people the service is not good and slow the food isn't good at all with horrible presentation.. I honestly think people are just fooled by this place because of its location . I've come several times to be fair and gave it another chance .. NEVER AGAIN  for the prices they charge . no way! I'll go to Del taco before I go back there again! I will also mention server push the bar  way to much..  way to quick on asking if you'd like another drink.. but you'll wait for refills on your ice tea or water.."}
{"text":"Great View, Great Margarita, the salsa was good, pretty spicy, we had the shrimp quesadilla which was pretty good. Service was outstanding. We will be going back to try more of their cuisine."}
{"text":"Sooooooooo goooood!  Very authentic food. Extensive menu. Friendly and attentive staff. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite Mexican Restaurants... The booths are the only complaint I have(small and are in need of updating) but that said its all about the food and i do enjoy table side guacamole and the portions are worth it..."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, I really did. The atmosphere is very authentic, the drinks were good, and the staff is friendly. However, I was very disappointed with my meal. I had the orange ruffy, shrimp and octopus deep fried ball. It was okay but definitely not worth the steep price. It was on the bland side. The person I was with wasn't too thrilled about their beef tacos, either. Disappointing."}
{"text":"First visit, based on stellar reviews. Service was awesome, fast, friendly and efficient. Chips & salsa and complimentary soup came out quickly. We had the Camerones Ranchero (wish it was more than 7 shrimp for 20 bucks, and was a bit overcooked), and the chicken fajitas were a bit greasy. The flavors were great, and so was the Margerita. Would come here again."}
{"text":"My go-to Mexican restaurant in Henderson. Food is good. I wish they would have a better salsa to dip the chips in. Go at sunset and ask for a window seat to see an amazing view of Vegas. There is usually a wait on the weekends.  Various affordable lunch entrees."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I visited after work for drink. Al although the view was nice the drinks weren't that great the margarita that I thought would be tasty and shakened was actually premixed and very tart which was a turn off. My friend had a Michelada which was not that great. There was a nice crowd with a live band and the food looked appealing. I'm not counting this place out but I will not order another one of their signature Margaritas."}
{"text":"Excellent service deserves 5 stars. From opening the door for you to taking away your empty beers and plates right away. Food is deliciously amazing although I've only had the chicken chimichanga lol Found this place on Yelp while craving and searching for Vegas' best michelada to cure my hangover and get me back in the game for the night 0:-) Anyway, you won't be disappointed coming here, the complimentary chips come with bean dip and delicious salsa as well !"}
{"text":"So we decided to stop in this place for a happy hour guess what!!!! We come out embarrassed thanks to the poor management from EDGAR AND EDDY !! Our server decided to dont serve us a margarita and a beer for one of our female guess, she is 21 years old but looks like 18 . Anyways the server jaime dint try even to be in our side !!! The only star in this review is for WALTER the busser he always with a smile and very fast checking our table , managers EDDY AND EDGAR just pass by many times not even look at us , they are a couple of JOKERS walking like a big AHOLES. So people go somewhere else for a happy hour cause this place is gonna look for an excuse to dont serve you !! What a shame on lindo Michoac√°n."}
{"text":"Linda Michoac√°n is definitely a great, reasonably priced Mexican restaurant in Vegas. This is well known. The only thing I can add is that yesterday I ordered the #9 lunch, roast pork in in tomatillo sauce substituting grilled vegetables for the rice and beans. Perfect for people like me watching their carbs. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at many Mexican Restaurants in Las Vegas, and the world for that matter!  Lindo Michoacan is on of the best in Las Vegas.  (Olamendi's in SoCal is the best in the world, just sayin...)  If you enjoy spicy, hot salsa, ask for their \"Habanero Salso\" when they bring the chips.  It's good AND hot!  Great fajitas, crunchy tacos, and GREAT MOLE!  Can't say anything bad (except the music is a bit loud in the main room.)  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here last week and my entire experience was incredible! This has been my first experience at this location, and I must say it will not be my last.   The servers are beyond kind and very personable! But it saddens me to take away a star; this is only because when the food came out, it was not hot - just warm. Granted - we did have a large group! So it can get difficult getting everything out at once I suppose. Regardless, everything tasted wonderful and the drinks were just as fantastic. You get chips and salsa as you wait for you're meal, and enjoy their delicious margaritas ;) If you request for a seat by the back windows, you can get a lovely view outside too.   Overall, very memorable evening."}
{"text":"My GF who lives in vegas brought me here because I wanted to eat Mexican food. It was a perfect recommendation as its a really spacious authentic Mexican restaurant perched on a slight incline overlooking the valley. This was close to Henderson and Green Valley.  Really large spacious restaurant with Gorgeous Views everywhere you sit. Really large expansive menu with so many items to choose from. Almost half the items I've never heard of before, it was truly authentic. This would be great for couples and large groups because it was so spacious inside.   We ordered shrimp and fish tacos and chili verde. My mom loves Chili Verde and commented it was the best she's had, large portions and the sauce was really flavourful.  The fish and shrimp tacos came with (3) each and rice and beans. It was a generous portion and exactly what I was in the mood for. Service was efficient and friendly. I saw them making Guacamole fresh tableside I'd definitely try that next time.  Great Mexican restaurant I would go again;)"}
{"text":"Its my 1st time here & gotta say it sucks!  It took an hour to get our food, and to top it off, it super overpriced & the food is not even that good!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food you'll find in Vegas....great handmade tortillas, good margaritas, the Carne Lenguna was phenomenal.  This is now a regular stop for me while in Vegas"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food at its best ! I'm glad I stopped by ! Everything in the strip seemed to Americanized . Thanks to the staff very friendly!"}
{"text":"Upon entering the parking lot I was amazed by the view of the Las Vegas strip and valley. Luckily we were able to get a seat by the window as we were immediately greeted with warm tortilla chips and salsa. Chile Rellenos Camaron and Novillo Al Jerez were ordered. I was speechless when the food arrived to the table due to the huge portions. I was unable to finish my dish so I had to box it up for later. The Chile Rellenos Camaron was good, however it was missing a bit of seasoning, but the Novillo Al Jerez was cooked perfectly. This place is great for date nights, families, birthdays, and every other occasion. The only downside here is the wait time after being seated. We waited about 15 mins before ordering."}
{"text":"A must place to come eat when in Vegas!!  We were greeted before we even walked in the door so that right away was my favorite part. It gets better... We were taken to our seats and the hostess was very friendly and informative. The waiter Jaime then came to get our drink order and we had them in no time. They were very accommodating from the busser to the manager. It felt really good to be taken care of and giving us such a great experience. Let's talk food! The menu is extensive (there's something for everyone no matter how picky ;) )and it was very hard to choose because everything looked, smelled and sounded delicious. I decided to split with my friend and we did ceviche de Cameron. torta de milanesa, and a shrimp taco. They all get 5 stars they were delicious and super filling. They also brought out the food very quickly and cooked to perfection.   If you're in Vegas you must must come here :)  Side note: very clean restaurant and clean bathrooms is always a plus."}
{"text":"My husband & I were staying at the golden nugget down town Las Vegas & we were craving Mexican food but not sure where to go. I read the reviews & sounded great so we decided to give it a try. The staff very friendly, great food ,mango margarita really good, carnitas burrito/fajitas was so full of flavor, my husband loved it! Nothing bad to say about this place at all, to bad we didn't live closer we would definatly be back soon!!! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Awesome views of the valley while eating. Food was good. Service was excellent. You get chips, salsa and beans complimentary to start. It was a little noisy in there however. I would come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I had not been to Lindo in many years. And I do not know why!  First off, please make reservations before you go! We made the mistake of going on a Saturday afternoon at 5:30. And although the wait for us was only 20 minutes, the people behind us were just being seated when we had finished our meal. And there was a line of dozens of folks wait  Aside from the excellent selection, delicious food, and charming ambiance, the service was outstanding! Each person from Luis, the manager, Jorge the busser, and the other service staff, they all worked as a TEAM!  As soon as our water was empty, somebody filled it. As soon as a table was empty another platoon of staff came in to clean it and prepare it for the next guest.  Back to the food, my wife had the empinadas and I had the carnitas. Our meals were served quickly. They were hot and fresh. The tortillas were right off the stove and too hot to handle! There was a homemade freshness to everything.   Make your reservation, load up the family and head over to Lindo Michoacan! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Awesome ambiance. Great food. Yummy margaritas. I make sure my dollars support Latinos."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Went here for a family party and expected good things but was not too impressed. Ordered the chimichanga, wouldn't get it again. I wasn't too big of a fan of the bean dip and salsa that came with the chips."}
{"text":"A very cool and authentic establishment, if not just a bit cramped on weekends. But at least you get to enjoy the live Mariachi band. For a decent price you get served huge portions. The chile relleno was to die for, and it came close to tasting like my mom's haha. If you're off the strip, do yourself a favor and come check this place out."}
{"text":"Most of the patrons are Spanish-speaking, super authentic, the food is great, the service is even better!!"}
{"text":"My favorite of the Lindo Michoacan restaurants. It has an amazing view of the city, the food is authentic and delicious, and the service is good."}
{"text":"My mom and I love their fried whole mojarra with salad and beans.  We order it everytime we come here.  My dad loves their beef fajita and other beef dishes.  He said the beef are flavorful and very tender.  My husband always order their enchiladas and tacos.  He said they were very tasty. Service is excellent.  My parents live in Las Vegas and they come here once a week.  The hostess and servers know them already.  My dad tells me they have really great margaritas (cadillac I think).  I have to take his word for it as I do not drink but since he is very picky with his margarita, i'm sure it's excellent."}
{"text":"Great food, super friendly staff, great chips and salsa. This location can be a little bit on the loud side at dinner time so keep that in mind if you want to seat and have a conversation. Other than that I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I really love the view at this place. A very nice, upscale restaurant. I've been here twice. The first time I really liked it, but the second time I went on a Friday night and it was pretty loud. A really nice Mariachi band played during our whole dinner and it was quite loud. I was taking my teenage niece out to eat so that we could connect and catch up. It's already hard enough to compete with her phone and her being a teenager. I had a hard time hearing her or talking over the music. Not sure if this is a just a weekend thing or what. The music is good, but it's just a little loud for my preference. My niece thought the fajita burito was really good. I ordered the carna asada tacos (subbing one with beef shoulder) and it was ok. I've had better. Dinner for two was about $35. I will probably try this place again, but I'd avoid weekends."}
{"text":"This is THE place to go for a spectacular view overlooking Las Vegas. The food is award winning, I know cause I've read about it and seen the awards. I've dined at the one on Desert Inn and I think the one off Sunset is the same owners, but for some reason I am not a huge fan of Lindo Michoacon. The food just doesn't do it for me, and I try to keep an open mind. I guess it's just a different style or recipe? Where is the zip, and gusto? No taste of onions, cilantro, salsa is nearly non existant. I had a chicken chimicanga and the chicken inside was all red and diced up. No other flavors or fillers, kind of bland and no zip. Why? Porque????  Even the chips and salsa wasn't right to me. The red dipping sauce is just plain, the chips are different and the beans are a nice touch, but it had a off taste to it and I LOVE Mexican beans. We had regular margaritas on the rocks, but even that was just average. Put a good amount of salt on the rim, shake the ingredients to a froth! The sour mix was almost grocery store quality. The margarita is the flagship drink, why not make it with some flare?! To me I go for the nice view of the city that is offered in a surprising location in Henderson. The service is very good and that is a plus too. I like it, but the food isnt' my style."}
{"text":"Years ago this was my absolute favorite Mexican restaurant, and not much has changed.   The hostess was very sweet and helpful when I arrived. I was waiting for a friend, and she was very accommodating.  Chips, salsa and been dip were brought out quickly. Salsa and bean dip are pretty good. I was mixing them together. I've had better table salsa, but I've also had much worse.  I ordered the fish tacos, and they were yummy. I went with fried fish, rather than the grilled, and they were very flavorful. I really liked that the sauce was served on the side... I love extra sauce and they gave me plenty.   I also ordered a beer, Tecate, with a salted glass.   FYI for Tecate lovers they have both cans and bottles.  The waiter was excellent to me, but a little salty to my friend (luckily I'm the one writing the review)  Overall excellent food, great beer (ask for a salted rim-so good), service evens out to pretty good... Mostly because my friend didn't mind the extra salt being thrown his way. I'm so glad this Las Vegas staple is so going strong."}
{"text":"Came here on Mother's Day! And yes it was really crowded. The service was good even though it was crowded. They filled my water and coke which I really like.  If you can't do simple things like that then who know what tips will be.   I ordered the Fillet Relleno I had to try it but it wasn't to my liking. I mean for $20 you thinking it would be amazing. The spouse ordered the carne asada. Not bad but it just didn't have that taste. The taste of carne asada which you can taste it's true. I've had my share of carne asada but this is OK. Maybe next time we will pick something different. The kids well she ordered her usual bean and rice side. No matter if it is amazing or blah, she will still love it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican in Vegas.  Authentic food and also great ambiance.  Steak Ranchero is excellent and very reasonably priced for the quality of steak served.  Deep fried Tilapia is a great if you are in the mood for seafood.  Fried and served whole, extremely crispy and a large portion.  Guacamole prepared right in front of you for an appetizer is also a must.  Two locations in Vegas, but I prefer the original one on D.I.  More festive and always a live crowd."}
{"text":"I was in town for the rodeo and friend said they really liked this place so I gave it a shot. I was certainly not disappointed !! Rating is closer to 4.5 stars.  The Mole dish we had was delicious (but still not as good as moms...). The gordo camarones (fat shrimp) appetizers were almost the size of a dinner. Split between 2, the combination sent us home with big smiles on our faces. The house margaritas were tasty, large and one did the trick. The flour tortillas were hand rolled on site.  I would say this place should be on your list for authentic Mexican food in LV. The plates around us also looked similarly large and tasty. Definitely not a fast food place. Stay a while and savor some good food...    Points off for maybe having better chips and salsa (though neither were bad and we ate more than one bowl of each)."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! It's so hard to find a place that has great food and great service but we found it!! This was our first time at this restaurant because we live In CA. We went there for my daughters 21st birthday this week and we were a very large party. They had our table ready for us when we arrived and were constantly taking care of us from start to finish!!! Jaimie our waiter was awesome!!  The food was delicious!!! Everything I tried was great, but my favorite was the shredded beef taco!! They even asked us if we wanted separate checks. And when it was time to sing Happy Birthday, all the staff made her feel so special!!! Thanks for making my daughters's night perfect!!! We will definitely be back!! Wish you had locations in CA."}
{"text":"My first time here and I probably won't return. Things started off not so good when we were seated in the booth at the back of the restaurant near the kitchen door and the bar area for the waiters. Then, although our waiter was nice, he was slow to return to take our order.  The chips seemed a bit oily, the salsa was thin and not flavorful, and the bean dip was just so-so. My husband ordered #13 and I ordered #6. The shredded chicken in both of our entrees was dry and his green chile was drab in taste with some of it being luke-warm.  The Spanish rice was not worth eating. The pricing was okay."}
{"text":"Not sure which was worse, the service or the food. This is three times we've been to this location and it's gotten progressively worse.   On this trip, it took 20 minutes to order, but only after flagging down a server. The appetizer took 45 minutes to arrive and it was another 30 minutes before entrees hit the table. The entrees (tacos, an enchilada and a chimichanga) were lukewarm. Lindo's prices are roughly 20-percent higher than the other non-strip Mexican eateries around Vegas and this is the overall quality you get?  On a side note, I ordered a Michelada. That was also substandard and bland."}
{"text":"Not overwhelmed at all. Lobster was overcooked, steak was dry and was a terrible cut, margarita was water ( it was supposed to be a Cadillac too ) and service was decent but nothing spectacular.    The ensalada was delicious tho..."}
{"text":"Beware!  Had dinner round 5:00 at the bar had a couple sips of my margarita and felt odd and so did my boyfriend. Got food to go and passed out on the way home and don't remember anything, and my boyfriend woke up with an awful headache.Pretty sure the bartender put something in our drinks. Just FYI. The food I've heard is good but won't ever go back there."}
{"text":"This place is so bomb I've probably came here a bunch of times. The food is really authentic, the spices are great. The frozen margaritas are really good i personally love the coconut and mango. The atmosphere is great makes you feel like your at your aunt or uncles house for dinner. The staff is really great too"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for my friends Bachelor party last weekend and we went here for Mexican food based on reviews here ...let me tell you guys something I have traveled the world and been in many nice restaurants in my life , as far as service I have never been to a better place than this one .The service was more than amazing .The food was fresh and delicious and on par with the top Mexican food I have had .The inside decor is great and easy on the eyes .If I could give them 10 stars I would . Great place"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Last time I went which was on Tuesday, my food was a bit overcooked and dry(chicken).  Every other time, it's perfect (Pollo al mojo de ajo).  On a side note, Best Flan in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing Mexican restaurant! Manny our server was great and friendly fron the begging! Jaime the Busser was on too of our table the entire time making sure we had enough to drink and kept clean. My girlfriend ordered carnitas mexicana that had jalape√±os in. She ordered with light jalape√±os but it was still extremely spicy for her. Hit or miss on spicy level. The manager Oscar came by immediately and fixed it right away. New plate not spicy and it came out super fast!  With such an amazing view, best margaritas in town and top notch food, this is a must for families or a romantic date!!"}
{"text":"I love Lindo! I actually enjoy this location as well as the one on Flamingo/215 and the other on DI/Pecos area.  This one has a view of the city to die for! The food is always fresh and delish! The table side quacamole is expensive, but so worth it. I love that this place offers free bean dip with the salsa too!  The only complaint I have is that it is always so freakin loud in here. The place is very open with high ceiling and it makes for the worst place to have any sort of dinner conversation. Good thing I am married and am more into the food at this point, because this would be a horrible date place :p"}
{"text":"The only offal item on the Applebee-style menu was lengua, and that was so dry and tough! Can an authentic Mexican restaurant really not offer other offal options? I think not!  If i wasn't there to meet up with some old friends (who got a recommendation from another friend), I would have turned around and left after just stepping through the front doors."}
{"text":"The place is always super busy, and you will have to wait. Food is okay - kind of hit and miss. Sometimes it's great, and sometimes it's greasy and doesn't taste fresh. It is not a bad local place but we are still looking for a better place around us."}
{"text":"Really good food and the atmosphere is even better. Don't come here if you want a nice quiet dinner. If you want a festive evening with fiesta flavors in your mouth as well this is the place. We ordered enchiladas, a chicken dish I forget the name and an appetizer item(pic uploaded). All were great. Chips salsa and bean dip were very good as well. Service was spectacular even when they were super busy on a Saturday night. What more can you ask for from a Mexican restaurant?? Thank you lindo for being here."}
{"text":"I've been to this place about a half dozen times.  The things I enjoy about this place have been the service the incredible view and the traditional dishes.  I must say that their chips and salsa or not that great the bean dip is very tasty though and for dinner, they give you a small soup that's tasty  They have really good lunch specials and that's probably the best time to come here  I've been with enough people who love it and didn't like it at all. One thing I tell everybody is avoid being a basic don't order a taco or a Burrito or tostada/enchilada, order their specialties, anyone I've been with an order of the basic shit has not enjoyed their meal but if they order a speciality dish (they probably have 30-40 or more options , that's where this place shines,   I usually go with the pollo de ajo y ojo. Basically chicken with garlic and olive oil and you make your own burrito or taco. The rice and beans are average   If it wasn't for the service and the ambience, probably be a three star, but it's enjoyable enough and the food if you get the right thing on the right day can be very tasty.   One tip,  if you get a steak dish it is a good value for a few extra bucks to upgrade your steak to a ribeye I strongly suggest doing that it's makes a difference"}
{"text":"I really like this place stop by each trip. The food is solid. The Chicken Tacos for lunch, and the Fajita Burrito I had was also just right."}
{"text":"Stopped by while visiting some family, on their recommendation, and was impressed.  I had the lunch special Pollo Amador and loved it.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauce was complex and flavorful.  Rice and beans were good, portion size was good for what you paid.  The dinner menu seemed expensive but I hear the portions are huge so that might be why.  Great view!"}
{"text":"OMG! Best Mexican food we've ever had. Hubby made reservations as it was Valentine's Day and we weren't sure how busy they got. We walked in and were greeted immediately. The host was very friendly and led us to our booth. The place is nicely decorated with flags, wood carvings, and brass decor. A mariachi band played great music in the background and they had us dancing in our seats within minutes. =]  Our server, Oliver was very helpful and attentive. He brought us some chips, salsa, and bean dip. We also ordered Tamarindo juice and Jamaica juice. Both were delicious and not to sweat. We decided to start off with guacamole, which was brought immediately to the table. They prepared it right in front of us using fresh avocado, lime juice, cilantro, onions, and tomatoes. Oliver asked if we needed help with the menu and made his suggestions. Hubby finally decided on Buey al Cilantro and I ordered Toro a la Coca Cola. Both of us ordered our steaks medium rare and crossed our fingers. Surprisingly, for a place that claims to have amazing restaurants, Las Vegas falls short when preparing steaks properly.   While we were waiting, we were served fideo soup, which is thin noodles in a tomato based soup. It was delicious and very savory. When the food came out, both of us were shocked at the huge servings!   The Buey al Cilantro is a rib eye steak cooked with cilantro and spices, covered with verde (green) sauce! The steak was perfectly cooked, we were both thrilled. The steak also came with beans, rice, and your choice of corn or flour tortillas.   The Toro a la Coca Cola is cooked in Coca Cola, garlic, dried red chiles, cloves, and secret ingredient. Yum! This steak was also perfectly cooked. The first bite was absolutely amazing. Their steak is tender, juicy, and wonderfully marinated. Their flour tortillas are huge and we had plenty of food to take home!  The employees are amazing. Even those who were not our servers came by and checked in on us. Our beverages were refilled constantly and was never below the halfway line. If management reads this, please recognize Oliver and Marcos for their wonderful service! Our bill came out to a little less than $60. My husband and I had no problem leaving them a $20 tip. We will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Very fun, authentic atmosphere. We dined here as our first night as Vegas residents, and are very lucky to have such a great establishment so close by. The food was awesome - the chips and salsa they serve is maybe the best I've ever had. Portion sizes are very generous as well.   Great service. Really good margaritas too!!"}
{"text":"The scene, the ambience, the view... The chips are actually good AF, ate like 3 rounds lol... The Strawberry Margarita's are good too,  ordered the Twin Lobster Joint... w/ deep fried shrimp. But back to the view it's just beautiful."}
{"text":"The ambience is inviting.  Starters given: salsa, bean dip & chips are alright  Main course . Photo provided of steak skewer . The food absolutely bland. Boyfriend had the steak with cognac and mushroom sauce. No flavor.  My first time and glad I had the taste but will not be coming back ."}
{"text":"some of the best Mexican restaurant ive been to in a long time. The Guacamole is the BEST they make it at you table or bar side so you can eat it how you like it!  I love Ceviche but i haven't food a place that makes it good until i came here to eat. Prices are reasonable and staff is friendly!"}
{"text":"I don't know what's going on with the negative reviews-- I've been here twice and enjoyed it both times.   The first time I was here with a bunch of friends for a birthday party. I ordered some sort of creamed chicken dish, which came out after a reasonable time and was pretty good. I don't know how authentic that is but it was tasty and that's all I cared about. The hot bean dip with the authentic chips is a definite plus, as is the home made spicy guacamole. The beans and rice are your standard mexican restaurant fare-- no complaints.  The second time I came here with my girlfriend. I ordered the steak colorado and she ordered the steak fajitas. I tasted both the entrees and thought it was pretty good stuff. The staff was very friendly, the view was beautiful, the prices were decent. What more can you ask for? Great place for a date!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love the chicken fajitas.  Lunch prices are a bonus.  Service was outstanding. Muy sabroso todo!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Michoacan Cobb Salad. It came out with no bacon nor tortilla strips as described on the menu. I asked the waiter for the bacon, apparently he did not understand. He returned 10 minutes later (this is during a work lunch break) with a new salad, this time, without the chorizo and still no bacon. My coworker translated to him in Spanish that I wanted bacon. He then told me after going to the kitchen that the chefs were cooking it. Well, the bacon never came and no explanation either. When it was time for the bill I told one of the drink servers to have the price of my salad reduced by $2.25 (the cheapest cost for sides at the restaurant) because the bacon never came. He did not understand, so my coworker had to translate to this fellow too. The original server then tried to offer me a free dessert which I declined- the whole point of getting a salad was to have a healthy lunch. I asked for the manager. The server tried to give me a free dessert again, so I asked to speak to the manager myself. The manager never came but did reduce the bill by 25%, which was fine with me because I did eat some of the salad and I wasn't trying to get a free meal, but it kind of sucked because of the whole situation I didn't even eat most of it (plus, the salad was not really that good). The rating is based on the salad but the service might as well be the same."}
{"text":"Located east of the strip - easy to find. Lots of locals go here. The atmosphere has lots of color / ceramic tiles all over. The margaritas are excellent with premium liquor choices as well, the menu variety is wide with excellent chicken, shrimp and beef dishes. I tried their Dulce de Leche cake and being a caramel fan, I thought I died and went to heaven. Their guacamole appetizer is made tableside just like a Caesar salad - and with your choice of seasonings/spices - that too was excellent.  Highly recommended - didn't need reservations surprisingly and the place holds a lot more than meets the eye. If in doubt, though, make a reservation."}
{"text":"I cannot believe that I have not written a review long time ago!  Great restaurant, great food and excellent service.  My favorite:  Marinera salad."}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is amazing!!   Let me start off with their customer service is #1. I was constantly always being taken care of whether it be taking away plates, refilling the chip bowl, refill drinks, and making sure everything is okay. They also had all smiles on their faces as it was a pleasure to take care of their customers. On top of that, I came during dinner which was extremely busy. But I was seated right away and taken care of  Once my order was placed, it wasn't even 10 minutes until I got my order. I was surprised with how fast I received my fresh order. Even though it was fast, the food was great!!  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place for one of your local Mexican spots. The environment is festive with all the decorations, everyone is happy, and the workers are  constantly helping you. There's also a live mariachi band that comes around the tables and perform.  Ps. You are served with chips, salsa, and bean dip in the beginning. And pretty much all plates come with rice, beans, and soup unless you get something off the al a carte.  Enjoy! You've gotta check this place out"}
{"text":"This restaurant is alright. The customer service was good, but my issue is the food. I expected from the hype it would have fantastic food. The food is alright, its very Mexican-American. I expected it to be more authentic. They give you a very generous amount of food, but the flavor of it is muted."}
{"text":"Horrible!  Had a chimichanga.  The outer layer should be fried-NOT!  It was if the food was frozen then warmed in the oven.  No seasoning in the chicken itself, plain on top! No lettuce, or tomato, salsa, or options for salsa,  The chicken was dry & bland.  Then they give you a small scoop of rice (about 5 tbsp) clumped (did I mention no seasoning) We actually had to put salt on our food!  and the beans are powdered!  We didn't see one bean. The Chips & Salsa = well the chips were good but the salsa=Gross! Nothing is homemade, the food is frozen then warmed.  The only item homemade is the table-side guacamole.  And the service, the waiters acted is if we're bothering them lol...Utterly disappointing and seriously overpriced for the quality of food and service you receive.  When I first came to LV I was taken to the original LM on Eastern and loved it!  But now that they have added locations, this place has gone seriously down hill!  What happened??? Service=horrible, Food=disgusting, Price=The price didn't match the quality.  Will never return!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was SOOOO crowded and its no wonder WHY.     We flew into Las Vegas to celebrate a friend's 60th Birthday,,   with the suggestion that we were going to the Michoac√°n (up in the Hills with the view) I read the reviews and really wanted to go there for dinner,,    the restaurant could not accommodate our group, so we ended up at a Pasta joint.     As we had a few hours to blow before our flight home,,  we decided to find the restaurant for an early dinner,,      a search took us to this \"Original\" location,,  What a GREAT find,,     I love Mexican food,, and this is one of the BEST Restaurants I have discovered.       Order the nachos with guacamole -    the owner comes to your table and makes the guacamole right there in front of you.   Great flavor and great chips.    I ordered the Menudo,,   wow,,  just as good a HOMEMADE.   a great blend of flavor and spices with no skimping on the ingredients.     With the chopped onion, lime juice and fresh cilantro.    Reminded me of my childhood.    I also ordered a Relleno with rice,,   truly FIRE ROASTED with great flavor.   Tortillas are hand made with old world flavor.    My wife ordered her Chile Verde dinner,,   the aroma was fabulous.    Even though the room was FULL,,   service was swift and courteous ,,   a Big family party of 21 were next to us,,  staffing was enough that they were able to serve this family of Adults and young kids all at the same time.       the aromas in the dinning room  were most inviting...   We will definitely come here  on our NEXT visit to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Waitress first day on the job.  Can\"t speak english.  Doesn\"t understand me.  Food is ok. View is great.  Sign says max play gets you free drink.  What it means is $20.  So they can't even write what they mean.  This place belongs in Mexico.  Sorry but this is USA.  I ask for lunch chili Verde I get tagged dinner and am charged for it.  Terrible, don't go here."}
{"text":"My number one go to Mexican food place in Vegas! I love the steak fajitas. And the green enchiladas I got last time were good but the chicken in the middle was a little dry. Also, I LOVE their salsa, but last time it was WAY too spicy to eat. Especially for a family restaurant. Also the view was great but the room with the window is extremely loud as it echoes and the main dining room is loud too due to the live band but it is possible to talk over. I also love their lunch specials as their reduced prices, smaller portions, and come with a drink."}
{"text":"No question in my mind - Lindo is the best Mexican restaurant in Henderson.  The menu is strikingly large, varied, and interesting. Starting with their table-prepared guacamole is a must. The margaritas are strong and well made. One of my favorites entr√©es is their Gallo al Co√±ac - chicken breast in a creamy cognac sauce - but you can hardly go wrong.   The wide open dining room has a lively energy to it, if sometimes a bit loud. The servers are fast and friendly. There's live music nearly every night, it seems.  The building is situated on a hill, and has enormous windows running the full length of the restaurant, giving it one of the nicest views of any Henderson restaurant.  If you've got the taste for Mexican, you really can't go wrong with Lindo Michoacan."}
{"text":"This was the worst birthday dinner ever. 2 hours later, our order was never placed, 3 tables had come and gone after eating. Waiter came back and asked us if we had ever ordered. Never placed our order. I had to go ask a manager for our bill. Don't just give someone ice cream and think it's all better. My time is worth more. No discount offered, and worse no apology except from the buss boy, who was great. My family won't be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Very authentic & delicious! My favorite is the Fideo soup & table side fresh guacamole!!!"}
{"text":"Food was OK, service was spotty.  We had good service early on getting attention from our waiter, the runner and others.  Once we got our food the waiter disappeared.  I got a combo with a Chicken Taco, Beef Enchilada and a Verde pork burrito.  The Verde was by far the star, I would order that again.  The taco and enchilada were bland and not worth ordering again.    The commentaries were a mixed bag.  You get soup, bean dip, salsa and chips.  Chips were good, salsa was on the spicy side which worked for me but was too spicy for the rest of my group, bean dip was bland and boring, the soup too was bland but I added a spoon full of salsa and it became worth eating."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night and boy oh boy was it packed. I personally would rather go to the one in Henderson but my family says it's not nearly as good. They said 10-15 minute wait but it was more like 30 minutes. I had the carnitas de la Mexicana and it was pretty good hot and spicy must have been the jalape√±os. The restaurant is always festive with a musical quartet playing guitar and violins and singing Mexican songs. It's probably the best Mexican food in Las Vegas. I had to park in no parking spot next door at the office building. Nobody in our party complained and even my two-year-old granddaughter ate her full of soup and guacamole. Returned for the steak ranchera and it was great. Guacamole wasn't mashed enough that was a first."}
{"text":"Great food and perfect service at a great price.. Def would recommend it and come back!!"}
{"text":"Authenticity as you walk in it smells like Fabuloso nothing says more than that about Mexican authenticity! The food and atmosphere are amazing! Definitely among top Mexican restaurants we have ever eaten. Absolutely the best house made tortillas!"}
{"text":"Great food! Celebrating our anniversary with some friends so we chose Mexican after all who doesn't like Mexican!  Food was delicious, staff was friendly, great little Mexican joint!  Definitely did not leave us disappointed"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food around. They have a few locations in the valley. The food is divine, the service is wonderful, very friendly people with great recommendations. It feels like you are welcomed into somebody's home. The place is set up and decorated like a giant Hispanic house. I was hooked after the first time."}
{"text":"The bf and I frequent this place when we're craving good Mexican food. The place is pretty big and great for bigger groups. Service is always on point and friendly.   Their fresh tableside guacamole is amazing and probably the best I've had in Vegas. I rate a Mexican restaurant by how well they make their guacamole and carne asada. Since this place gets both items very right all the time, it's easily one of my favorites.  If you come here, you have to know what to order. Don't go to a Mexican restaurant and order a simple burrito or quesadilla. There's really not much you can do with those items. They're going to taste the same almost everywhere. You might as well just stick with Del Taco or Taco Bell. See what everyone else is raving about on here and try those items instead.   * One interesting memory there was when I went for a birthday party and the server along with a legit mariachi band came to our table to give the birthday boy a shot of tequila. After their little song and dance, they tilted his head back and poured the tequila down his throat! Hilarious!"}
{"text":"This was great authentic Mexican food! Atmosphere was nice... adobe feel... lots of art... Mariachi band too. Definitely recommend.  Went to Desert Inn road location."}
{"text":"I like the view if you get a spot by the window, and the service is great.  The food is very tasty!  Try the chicken tie ester!  Yummy & spicey  Downfall:  the noise level is extreme!  Poor acoustics amplify every noise along with the   Live music. If you cant hear your date who is sitting next to you..,then your place is too loud.  Please keep small children at home, as the noise level startles them along with the ringing of the birthday bell ...causing them ti scream over the noise."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that this place proves the theory that great & attentive staff will increase the review ratings.   The staff were amazing & the place is very clean.  I got to the menu...great selections, large portions and such potential!!  The food arrived and .....soooo disappointed! Zero flavor.  Beans were runny, salsa was runny, fajitas were bland.    On a positive note the adult tasty beverages of Sangria and Margaritas were good.   End result ...head to the bar, have a drink & avoid the food at all costs unless you bring your own seasonings."}
{"text":"We visited on a Sunday and probably should have gone with the brunch buffet but as it was our first visit we ordered what we wanted. Everything looked good on the buffet table but the did not have chorizo con huevos and my brother had green chillaqueles, both dishes were good. In fact everthing looked good on the menu. I would probbly go back if I ever had the chance.   So why not more stars? Mom, who had a cup of muendo did not have any posole in the bowl. We were so surprised thinking maybe this is the unique prepration advertised in the menu. As it turns out it was just bad luck because the bus boy, who was much friendlier than the waiter assured us that the meundo on the buffet table had hommonie in it. The other reason it did not get more stars was because we asked ourselves what we considered a 5 star Mexican restaurant and we agreed it was Casa Garcias in Anaheim, CA. This was based on the food alone because the atmosphere is much nicer here. In all it was a good visit but we tend to be a lot harder in our evaluation of Mexican.   On a side note, it was interesting to note that the owner was named Timoteo Barajas, which is the same as mine."}
{"text":"Had a great time again!! It all begins with great service, nice atmosphere and a tasty selection of food. Lindo Michoacan has exactly that. Located in Henderson just off of Horizon Ridge. The view of the entire Las Vegas Valley is beautiful and romantic. If you haven't been there yet, start making plans!!"}
{"text":"I believe this is the best Mexican food I've ever had at a restaurant. The fish tacos are so good I've had them on several different visits. Also the carnitas with the coca cola sauce is amazing. Very tender and delicious. The guacamole is made table side and is great. The atmosphere here is just so warm and inviting with live music and a friendly staff. I love this place."}
{"text":"have eaten here twice; once dining in and another, take-away. The dining in experience was decent. Server was good. I wanted shrimp and asked for a recommendation that also had a spicy kick. It was meeeh. About 6 medium shrimp with a cream red sauce that was not as spicy as I had hoped for but remedied that w extra condiment. Certainly wasn't worth the nearly 20 buckaroos. Margaritas were not bad.  Take away got a steak burrito and that was good.   Have to say it's been a chore finding stand out Mexican in this town, and thought it would be the opposite!"}
{"text":"I was less than impressed with the chips and salsa. The chips were a little well done and the salsa was hot. I LOVE salsa and I was unable to eat this stuff.  The service was fantastic! I was impressed with how attentive our servers were.  My food was just OK. I ordered the \"Grandpa Timo's Shrimp.\" Translate into Spanish to order. It was gulf shrimp, stuffed with cheese and peppers, wrapped in bacon and then deep fried. Three of my favorite things in one dish. The shrimp was fantastic but the bacon was really really crunchy. The cheese and the Timo sauce were good.  My wife had the Orange Roughy and enjoyed it. Our meal, without drinks, came to about $42. Not too bad and truly worth it if the service is always going to be this great. We left a great tip."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for Mexican, and came by here with a friend. It's definitely not a cheap taco place at all. The place is huge. They have 2 two areas and a large bar. I believe they also have outdoor seating as well. They serve complimentary chips and salsa, along with refried beans. Chips were delicious. Thick and cruncy. I hate the flimsy ones some places give you. The salsa was OK, it was smoky maybe or something, but I like mine with more of a tomato kick. The beans were good but they got cold quickly. I ordered the veggie fajitas. It's my favorite mexican dish. It was pretty good. Not the best I've had but good. My friend got the chicken enchiladas and she enjoyed. They had a chipotle cesar salad and I was torn between that and the fajitas. I wish I would have gotten that. It has grilled corn and queso fresco with chipotle cesar dressing....sounds delicious. Maybe I'll try that next time! Price was definitely pricey. Not cheap at all. Portion sizes were nice though. Service was good and food was good."}
{"text":"Went here with a couple of my friends & really enjoyed it. They bring you complimentary chips with salsa and bean dip, which was absolutely amazing. After you order your food, they bring some soup which was also to die for. I ordered 2 shredded beef tamales and a side of mexican rice. Tamales were nice but mexican rice could've have more flavor. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Their service is phenomenal. I can't get enough. I really enjoyed their salad creations and I tried the chimichanga which I loved. You can't beat that fresh made guacamole right at your table."}
{"text":"Walking in, we noticed the rustic Southwest decor and the Mexican tunes that filled the air. Really fresh n' tasty food at this place. Even the chips and two dips were tasty. I put my service dog under the table and put some water in her bowl. They were fine with her being there.  I ordered the three fish tacos and they were delicious. My girl had the chile rellenos. Both were very fresh. My tacos came battered with a slice of avocado, lemon wedges and a tangy mayo-based dipping sauce. Chopped lettuce and diced tomatoes for toppings as well.  I also ordered a plain chicken breast for my service dog. I expected a chicken breast on a small plate. They brought it all cut up into pieces and in a pie tin. Very nice of them actually.   The service was on the slow side, but they were attentive enough. My dog ate pretty well - in fact all three of us did. I would eat here again even though the prices were kind of steep."}
{"text":"For authentic Mexican food in the desert, Lindo Michoacan is great.  The food taste amazing, the salsa is spicy, the margarita's are strong and the portions are large.  The service is also very wonderful.  I had the carnitas on the bone and it was fall off the bone moist and succulent.  The burrito is also super huge and can be enjoyed by 2 people!   We also had the Queso Fundedo con Choritzo for the app.  It was not the best I've ever had.  I would pass the next time.  When My wife was sick, I came her to get the Pollo soup and it was fabulous, hit the spot.    The only downfall is that is quite expensive for Mexican food.  Our dinner bill was around $80 (1 drink).  I always feel like Asian food and Mexican food should not be that expensive.   My humble opinon.  Other than that, if you are looking for great Mexican food, I'd recommend."}
{"text":"It's an OKAY to eat here. It doesn't taste authentic at all. The poblano enchilada were gross. They were cheese enchiladas and a chicken breast on top. The were pretty bland. Customer service is okay. They weren't really paying attention to us. But, the Cadillac Margarita was really good."}
{"text":"After we were seated they brought out a complimentary cup of soup for my son, which he proceeded to grab and dump in my lap. Luckily it was only luke warm and didn't do much damage other than irritate me and soak my shorts. Despite that unfortunate beginning, we had a good time at Lindo.  I've only been to Mexico a few times and can't speak to the authenticity of the place. But, judging from it's location in Spring Valley (btw, thanks Misti for finally establishing the neighborhoods for Vegas Yelp, otherwise I would have thought this place was in Summerlin ; ) and the surrounding neighborhoods I'm guessing they cater to a gringo audience. Since I'm a gringo myself I don't mind.  The service was excellent. Our order was taken promptly, food came out quickly, water was refilled frequently, dishes were picked up right after we were done, and the waiter(s) stopped by often to check in on us.  The food was pretty good overall. I liked the chips, salsa and bean dip. The guacamole is made tableside to your desired level of spiciness and it was some of the best guac I've had in a long time. The amount was more than enough for the three of us and would have been good for four adults. We got an order of flautas (3 beef and 3 chicken). The beef was a little dry and not too flavorful. The chicken was tender and tasty -- definitely the better of the two. We  also got a beef tamale. It was oversauced and too mushy for my liking. My son had the cheese quesadilla, which he liked.  The atmosphere is great for families -- and there were a LOT of families there. One side of the restaurant had a mariachi band and the other side (near the bar) had a guy on keyboards singing. There was even a little \"dance\" area where kids were getting their groove on. This is definitely one of the better family-friendly restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Food: D+ Atmosphere: F, would have been a B but read further Drinks: D+ Music: C  Sat in a booth and had to wait for a server for about 30 minutes because of the band that needed to play with their rear ends in our face. At least it was authentic, I think.  The margaritas that everyone has raved about on Yelp are sub par.    The guacamole was actually very good. The nachos were pretty good as well. The soup they give you is awesome. So how did it get a D+? The dinners were terrible. As for the food, the \"gulf\" shrimp are salad shrimp that ruin what was a flavorful dish. The chicken salad was over cooked chicken on some leaves of lettuce. The mole poblano had the same terrible chicken as the salad that ruined the dish.   Bottom line: Stick to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Today we went to Lindo Michoacan in Henderson and we order enchiladas Mole and it was amazing. My recommendation to order with the cream separate because mole is very heavy.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"No bad!, still Mexican food make for American people no for people from Mexico look real Mexican food.  Carne Tampique√±a is not like the one we eat in Mexico. Chilaquiles taste good, but we always have to tell  want pollo desebrado, not with sour cream. I love the location in Henderson they always nice and friendly.  The original in DI is good to."}
{"text":"I love this place every time I come from LA I always take my family to eat!!! Every time is gets better and the service is amazing!!! I'll keep coming here every time I come to Vegas"}
{"text":"Lindo has existed in this same East Las Vegas location for decades. It's longevity is a testament to the flavor and quality of their food.  The original building was damaged in a fire in the 1990's, but was rebuilt and stands to this day. The late Pat Murita dined here often. It was one of his favorite restaurants in the world.  Always friendly and attentive service.  Evening diners will be entertained by a professional Mariachi band.  The atmosphere is festive and lively. Great for groups and families.    The menu features a variety of authentic favorites from Mexico's Michoac√° region.  The seafood specialties are killer. The camarones (shrimp) are always plump and flavorful. Beef, chicken and pork dishes are also excellent.  Anyone who has ever eaten here will tell you that's it's some of the best Latino food you will ever have.   They do a table-side guacamole flavored exactly to your liking."}
{"text":"I usually don't like to pay for fancy Mexican food when I'm perfectly content with a fix from Roberto's or Amigos Tacos. But my experience at Lindo Michoacan made it all worth it.  I went with a party of ten (including two babies) and was seated promptly since we had a reservation. We were hoping to get seated where they have an amazing view of the valley but that wasn't available.  They were quick to bring warm chips, salsa and bean dip. You can seriously get full just from the chips. The servers continuously refilled our chips to ensure they were warm for us.Try the fresh guacamole! It is made table side so you know it can't get any fresher.  I ordered their shrimp enchiladas (over $18) and although it was good, I felt it was overpriced. Good thing I filled up on chips and their complimentary fideo soup.  I give this place 4 stars because of their excellent service. Our water was never less than 3/4 full. We were checked on regularly. And even though some people in our party came late and we ended up being there for three hours, we never felt rushed.  They have a live band which adds to the fun ambiance. I prefer restaurants where I don't have to yell to talk to the person next to me, but just know that's what to expect here on a Friday night.  Kudos to the staff at Lindo Michoacan for your attentive service!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for Lindo, yet! This is my all-time favorite Mexican restaurant. I come here with my family and friends at least twice a month.  If you go to Lindo, you MUST get the table-side guacamole. They bring all of the ingredients to your table, ask you how you like it, and then they make it right there. So good! I'm boring and I always get the steak fajitas, but they are bomb. Can't really go wrong with food here.   Margaritas are delicious, too ;)  Service is normally good, though sometimes it can be a little iffy."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and service. Nice atmosphere. We come here often and are always pleased with our meal. Excellent Chile Rellenos, Enchiladas, and burritos.  Wish their salsa that comes with the chips was more tomato-y and flavorful but that is my only complaint. Recommend highly."}
{"text":"I had the beef enchiladas & for dessert churros.. The beef enchiladas were alright & the churros were very hard, very disappointing.."}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan of Mexican restaurants being that I'm Mexican and I don't see the point in paying for stuff I grew up eating. This place was definitely an exception. The best thing about this place is the customer service. Everyone is so nice and so attentive. It was my sister's 21st birthday so they sang her a song with guitar and all and even gave her a shot and a churro desert! The food is delicious. As soon as you sit down you are offered chips with beans and salsa. Not only that but they also give you a nice little warm bowl of fideo soup. The food is very fresh and delicous. And the tortillas...OMGSH. They're homemade and soooooo good. I've never been to another restaurant that made hand made tortillas!! They really do treat you like family as soon as you walk in the door. The decor is also very authentic and you can tell the decorations were brought over from Mexico. You really don't find too many restaurants like these anymore.Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Just recently I relocated to Las Vegas from San Diego aka \"The Land of the Best Mexican Food\" lol ok ok Maybe that's just my personal opinion. Since we've moved out here we have been on the hunt for decent Mexican food in Las Vegas. My friend Lacey introduced me to Lindo Michoacan in Henderson location. I so impressed with the beautiful setting over looking the Las Vegas skyline. I've been to the Henderson location a few times and every time I have such a great experience. The food was amazing!!! I enjoyed the \"Gallo al Chipotle Estilo\" and the freshly made Guacamole. They have live music, freshly maid tortillas, the Henderson location has the best night view of Las Vegas and how can you beat fresh Guacamole!!!!!??!?!?? Great costumer service, great food, great ambiance, hands down my favorite Mexican food in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This Mexican is impressed by their menu, Cadillac margarita, panoramic view, and overall aesthetics."}

{"text":"One star goes to the amazing bean dip that how can you possibly mess up? And the second star goes to the awesome quesso fundido.   Moving on to the negatives....  The prices are ridiculously high considering how far from authentic this is to Mexican. The chilaquiles were terrible. The staff didn't seem to be completely \"there\". I've never been a huge fan of the Lindo chains....feel like they should try a lot harder to be more authentic with their food. They never fail to disappoint me."}
{"text":"Great place! My co worker recommended it. We made reservations and thankfully we did. The line was outside..people were sitting and waiting in the parking lot. We were seated within 5 minutes. Had drinks on the table within another 5. The food  here is Soo good! I tried their carne asada plate along with their margarita. The waiter was very attentive you wouldn't have noticed he was juggling as many tables as he did.   My food was really good I asked for medium rare and that is what I received. To top it off the server literally prepared the quacamole right in front of us.   Only downside would have to be the price. For my food and one drink my bill was $40.  The margarita could have been better as well. Definitely recommend and make sure to get a reservation."}
{"text":"Went here after a trade show for some company encouragement dinner; place is hella packed with people on a weekday.  THIS PLACE IS THE BOMB.  If you want authentic, gourmet, mexican sit in dining, this is the joint to be.  All of their meat is juicy, their refried beans are perfectly cooked with just the right amount of cheese, fresh salsa refilled at every minute, excellent and attentive service and their dessert, oh god their dessert is just ludicrously rich and sweet.  Great place to take clients out!"}
{"text":"Great view of the city.  Good Mexican food, live entertainment in the evening.  Nice atmosphere and  authentic Mexican food.  There are 3 or 4 other locations around town, this has the best view.  I go here once every week or two for lunch.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I like the new location!  Ask for the green sauce for your chips.  I suggest talking to your waitstaff.  There's so many options on the menu.  The view from the window to the strip is awesome and great for date night or dinner with the family.  The mariachis are great and fun.  They do requests too!"}
{"text":"Love the food.  Nice ambience.  Large portions.  Drinks are excellent!  The location I went to is convenient.  The staff are friendly and very helpful!"}
{"text":"Lindo - on DI used to be a great place.  But it seems like the secret got out, the business grew and quality suffered.  It kind of reminds me of going to a large chain style Mexican Restaurant in Southern Cal.  If that's your thing - this place is for you.  I leave here feeling like I have consumed 100lbs of salt, it's very loud and parking is tough.  But it does have the best view in town."}
{"text":"Lindo has some really great upsides...awesome and efficient service, great margaritas and a large/option filled menu.   The downside...every time I leave I feel fat as hell! I don't think I have EVER had a meal there and not napped afterwards! lol   The chips and salsa and good, the Don Fransico is amazing and the live music was really enjoyable! (Top 40 remakes)"}
{"text":"Really AMAZING VIEWS !!!! Romantic ( maybe because I was keeping it with someone sexy ) and the chips and guacamole were insanely good and the staff were super hustlers always accommodating. My first visit will be back ! Btw the bar has amazing views of the strip as well as the back room !"}
{"text":"Went here for a dinner, heard the view was amazing and it was definitely pretty good.  My girlfriend and I had a reservation and were seated promptly.  It was a bit noisy, but oh well.  We were quickly given some chips and our drinks and our food was done and at our table pretty quickly.  My girlfriend had the raspberry margarita and we both thought it was excellent.  For food, I got the \"cry today, cry tomorrow\" with chicken, which is supposed to be super spicy.  My girlfriend got the coca-cola carnitas.  The quality of the food was only so-so.  The chips were good, but some of them were stale.  The bean dip was a bit watery though the salsa was good.  My chicken was of a good quality but the sauce was awful.  Yes, it's hot, about a 7/10 on my scale and I eat ghost pepper regularly.  However the flavor was like they took some regular sauce you would find on a Mexican dish and added a bunch of dirt to it -- very dark and earthy.  The taste reminded me of when I went to Bangkok Orchid (which I also wrote a review of) and asked for a super hot panang -- the flavor was ruined by whatever they put in it to make it very hot.  It's definitely possible to have very spicy food without destroying the flavor!  The beans were meh, the rice was OK, I asked for corn tortillas but got flour, and I asked for no lettuce on the plate and there was some.  My girlfriend liked the carnitas and I did too at first but on sampling them again I was not as much of a fan.    Where things really failed were in the service department.  Our server was Antonio and he was great at the start but after delivering our food he came back 1 minute later to see if everything was OK and then did not show up for another 30 -- after we had been done for 5 minutes or so, and after our water had been almost empty for a good 15 minutes.  When he did show up he was actually just about to run by our table again and stopped himself.  He asked if we needed more water and I asked for a box for left overs and the check.  He said he'd get that.  10 minutes later he shows up again with a box but no water.  Finally another 5 minutes pass and we get water and the check.  Even with a 15% off coupon, everything came to $45.  Forget this place, go to Jalisco Cantina -- better food, prices, and service.  It doesn't have the view but everything else is better."}
{"text":"Table side guac and great city views.  The service was good and the food was good.  Right away we were served a huge portion of chips, salsa and beans. All delicious and helped hold us over before we got our food. We ordered the guacamole and it was made fresh, table-side. It was delicious.   Up next we had the veggie fajitas, and a combo plate of chili rellenos and a chicken taco. I liked the flavors of the fajitas full of tons of different vegetables and I like that the tortillas are made fresh.   The views of the city can't be beat."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars, although if it were there food alone, I would say 4 stars.   They have the best service in all of Las Vegas when it comes to restaurants. The atmosphere is fun and exciting with often times live music.   Free chips and salsa as well as being dip with any meal. Try their tableside welcome moly, they will prepare it fresh right next to you.  I like all sorts of dishes on the menu, but I prefer to order al la carte 3 tacos with shredded chicken.   Their fried ice cream or churros are absolutely amazing! Try this place out, it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Yummy, enjoyed my extra large mango margarita! I've never had a bad meal here. We tend to have birthday  celebrations here. They help make it fun. This location is large and was not very busy mid week. Try!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food and good margaritas. Service is excellent. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"this place has the best guacamole i have ever had in my life, and they make it right at your table. This place was VERY busy when i was here on cindo de mayo but its a true mexican restaurant. The ambience is awesome... there was a mariachi band and a guy singing while playing guitar while we enjoyed our dinner and delicious margarita mangos!! Everyone in my group was happy with their meal :)"}
{"text":"Great views of Las Vegas, everyone loves the views.  No one liked the food.   Not vegetarian friendly.  Waiter was pretentious, started giving my guests a hard time for being vegetarian, then lied about the tomato soup being vegetarian !! Wow this place is mismanaged.  Staff look at you like your a gringo.   Have been there multiple times for guests and business associates visiting from out of town.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Had the Fish Tacos for Lunch. Grilled perfectly and alot of fish in each of the 3 tacos. Not much room for the cabbage that came on the side but they didn't even need it. Very good, will return!"}
{"text":"This placed was jammed packed on the weekend! A 30 min wait upon entry but it went by pretty fast. There so much going on and also a mariachi band playing the entire time to keep you entertained. -Soon as you are seated you are greeted with chips, salsa and re-fried beans. We asked for the guacamole and our server came right back and prepared it table side for u. It was some of the best i ever ate! -I had the garlic fish with re-fried beans and rice that come with the entree. You choice of flower or corn tortillas that are homemade. My wife mentioned it was our wedding anniversary, we were surprised with a solo performance from the staff and the ban. They place sombreros on our heads and had a slam a shot of tequila was a good time. Complimentary churros were brought out while they sang to us...Delish!!"}
{"text":"GREAT food and drinks! View is outrageous.  Had the avocado tacos and the chicken fafitas, both were fabulous.  Bean dip and salsa with your chips... salsa was not too hot and bean dip was warm... Yummy. I would post pictures but we devoured everything!!"}
{"text":"The food was gr8. I'd give it 5 stars if only I had seen the server more often. The venue has a beautiful view n layout. I had no reservation n I got sat down immediately. Besides the sticky menu, the food came out promptly n was delicious.   What really bothers me is that,  I wish we could tip the busser NOT the server. The bus boy gave us gr8 service, more attention n packed our leftovers. That's my only gripe.   Please tip the busser cash. I'm a regular n I feel for them"}
{"text":"I seen this restaurant in the travel channel and was curious to try.  The food was great! the service was friendly and quick I will visit this place again and again.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Best Off the strip Mexican food! Authentic atmosphere with delicious food! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Yummy.  I had the Carintas burrito w/rice and beans,  S had Shrimp Cocktail;  AD had the Carne Asada Tacos n LD had Tacos.  Yummy.   Service was great and food awesome!"}
{"text":"Loved the grilled shrimp tacos.... and the Jumbo Cadlic Margarita on the rocks, Ooooo yeah!"}
{"text":"Below average visit. Both entrees were shrimp and both were terribly overcooked. Food was fast so the shrimp were definitely reheated and terrible."}
{"text":"Delish seafood and Mexican cokes, as well as the basics. A good value."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance. My friend however was a little overwhelmed with the smell of fabuloso. Awesome cheese enchiladas and carnitas soft tacos. Chips and salsa always good."}
{"text":"Great fajitas best ever had here so far. Plus the view from this place is amazing. Just don't tell them it's your birthday!!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant in town.  I have been going to this joint for over 20 years.  The service is always wonderful.  The food is amazing, and fresh.  The table side guac is the best!"}
{"text":"One of the best places I've had not only in Vegas but everywhere I've been, the food tastes great and authentic and the staff is wonderful very welcoming and attentive. I'm so glad I tried this place I probably won't wanna try anything else after coming here. The lunch specials are to die for, half off on the beer and great selections! Soup for the kids is convenient and taste really good as well 5 stars no doubt"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance. Great food great drinks and wonderful service .. Definitely will go back when I visit again!!!"}
{"text":"Prices a bit high, but food is great and the service is always outstanding.  Their shredded beef is very tasty."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas! Love their chips with salsa and bean dip. Their dishes are authentic and homemade tortillas. Always a must to visit when visiting the city. Service is fast and great too."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food. There is nice live music and it's usually very busy.  The pasta soup is delicious and we always get the tableside guacamole.  The menu is extensive and we usually go with a seafood dish or either fish or shrimp tacos. It's all very good.  I took off a star because the waitstaff is hit or miss. It's apparent that some waiters like their job and some just don't like the paying customer.  We will continue to eat here, but we know now who to avoid!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food we've had in Southern Nevada.  The atmosphere is fun, service is great, and the view is amazing.  Perfect date night!"}
{"text":"The food is great normally however this location is not the same or near comparable to summerline , today I ordered my normal Carna Asada salad extra chard, had to ask them to blacken it more and it took them 25min for a salad to be returned to me , by then my lunch was over and my company had finished their food ..."}
{"text":"Great fish tacos.  But salsa they serve with their chips... kind of not to my liking. And they also serve two bowls of refried beans to dip your chips in too.  That was weird. Or maybe I'm weird. I don't know.  But that was a first for me at a Mexican restaurant.  I mean, I know they serve beans as a side with your meal but as a dip for your chips? Weird.   That's pretty much all I can say about this place. The ambiance though felt like a chain restaurant.   This place was good, but not great."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my husband and his friend and the only Mexican food lindo is comparable to is the dog meat they serve on the side of the road In downtown cancun . I can't believe we paid 75$ for a dinner I could have got on the clearance shelf at smiths . The table side guacamole was bland . I don't understand how it is possible to screw up guacamole that us Made with\" fresh \" ingredients but apparently it very easy !   I got a three item combo , everything did not have good flavor . The chile relleno was covered in the same red tomato sauce as the chicken enchilada that has dry chicken meat . The beef taco was the best part of my meal and was comparable to Roberto's   My husbands meal was the worst part of our whole experience . His beef dish wasn't edible as every few bites had so much fat I had to literally ask for a new napkin just to spit the meat I couldn't swallow into . Who serves meat like this at an establishment that is so well known ?!?! I have literally had better quality meat from don tortaco ! WhAt a disappointment !   The only thing I can say was good about our experience was the service , our sever was very attentive and it was not his fault a \"Mexican food \" place was serving food that should not have been approved by the FDA ."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great staff. I have never had a bad meal here and if anything was wrong they have been quick to remedy the problem. Great place for a quick lunch if you can bear to stay away from the margaritas."}
{"text":"Had been here previously (3 years ago) and certainly didn't disappoint.  Had friends that were getting married and looking for a place to eat for our group of 30+ people so I recommended the place.  Not only did they send a shuttle to pick up the wedding party but also seated us right away and gave us all superb service.  Drinks were constantly being refilled without asking and at the end of the night we were all dropped off near our hotels on the strip.  Food was excellent, service was excellent and overall it was a memorable experience!"}
{"text":"Great place for Mexican food. Ordered Burrito - it was delicious. Also I appreciate the large beer mugs. They make a fresh guacamole from scratch right next to you, so you can choose the ingredients."}
{"text":"This is such a beautiful restaurant, especially if you can get a seat by the window. We finally were able to do that, since we came at sort of an off-time, (4:30 pm) which I highly recommend if you want to get a window seat. The food is good, but the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that to me, the soup is way too salty, and the chili relleno was just OK. The chips and dip were outstanding, as were the enchiladas. The service was very good, and, the Cadillac margaritas are quite nice!"}
{"text":"must have: steak ranchero w/chile verde!!! omgggg its so thick, and juicy goood and tender and seasoned perfectly topped w/cheese and green chile sauce... its seriously THAT good!!!! everything else here is too.. svc, apps, drinks and atmosphere but we seem to forget about this little gem we got here and returned this past monday after we hadnt been there for probably a year? maybe more? we are never disappointed, and the steak is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Chimichanga was very bland. Been waiting anxiously to try this place, great location and view was great. But a little  pricey. Chicken fajitas were good and came out  steaming like they should.  Waiter was  nice and had a beautiful ass. I'd go back just to gawk at that again."}
{"text":"One of the best places for mexican food in town. Similiar prices to Red Lobster if you need a reference. This particular location sits on top of a hill with a spectacular view of the Las Vegas strip and well as other nearby casino/resorts. Expect a short wait to be seated, they do get rather busy. However the service is fast and friendly, we had three servers attending to us. There were no mix ups, a single one forgetting about us nor did anyone seem frustrated with the dinner rush. My steak was cooked perfectly and to my desire however the lobster tail was a bit over done. It was good just a little dryer than I would like. They had a mariachi band playing and would go up to tables to play if it was a persons birthday or other celebration which included staff singing along."}
{"text":"Food is amazing but what's even more amazing is the service!!!! My waiter was Octavio and Aldo! They were amazing!!! I also happened to come during happy hr got a michelada for 4.50!!! Great size and everything!!!! Overall amazing experience!!!!!"}
{"text":"We tried this place at the recommendation of good friends. We were very disappointed: The chips were poor in quality. The salsa was thin and runny - no tomato pieces. When we asked to substitute black beans for the wallpaper-paste re fried beans (those are seldom good anywhere), we were told they didn't have any. They did offer pinto beans instead. We ordered a side of guacamole, the waiter seemed to hesitate but finally delivered it after being reminded again. When it arrived, it was poorly prepared (lumpy and tasteless). My tamale was dripping water and the chicken enchilada was like the guac - tasteless and not very warm.   Never again."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other yelpers. I am a huge carnitas fan and the carnitas here are really good. They come with good basic rice and beans and fresh homemade tortillas, and the guacamole is fresh made and tasty. I really liked the chips, salsa, and the bean dip served at the beginning. The shredded beef tacos are good too.  Some of the other things are a miss....the chimichangas are bad...from the shrimp and the chicken they are just bland.  Service is good and our server pepe was great.  I would go again...although I think san francisco has better mexican food."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic, the Buey y Coca Cola (Rib Eye marinated in Coca Cola) is amazing. I prefer my steaks on the rare side, so as usual I ordered it Med. Rare. Excellent however the marinade was so good, I think I could have got even more flavor out of steak at medium. Highly recommended everything here."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, food, a servers are all great here! I've been here 3 times, and each time is always better. If you can, ask to be seated by the windows; its so pretty especially at night. The coca cola pork is my favorite thing to get, its sooooo tender and the flavor is mouthwatering. Also the the chips, refried beans and red chili sauce they give you before your meal are so good! One more thing, the frozen mango margarita though...it's everything (I'm not even big on alcohol)."}
{"text":"The food was good. What really stood out was the customer service. The place is packed but they get you in without long waits. The happy birthday songs going off every so often was a little distracting but fun."}
{"text":"Great Sunday Brunch...  Awesome location, Sits high on top of the hill with amazing post card view of the city.  Service is spot on. The staff treats everyone like family. The appetizers are great and love them making fresh guacamole table side. Like ordering different entrees and serving it family style. It's said repeat business is highest form of compliment, and we've been faithful patrons since this location opened!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service and impressive decor! Awesome place, little pricey, but you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food with a cool traditional Mexican ambiance. It gets crowded often so try and call ahead. The service is not bad and they usually have someone singing or playing live Mexican music at night. Priced well for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"First time trying this place last night with my family... it was super busy, there was so many people waiting outside and I honestly didn't want to wait but the wait was so short because they are super quick to take people in!!   I did order the sopes plate it comes with 6 lil sopes and I thought that they were so lil that I was still going to be hungry so I also ordered a shrimp empanizado taco and let me tell you that I was soooo full by the time I finished  3 lil sopes and the shrimp taco but EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS highly recommend this place and there mango margaritas."}
{"text":"Stay away from Alberto the rude waiter. I order a corona lite on draft. He brings a bottle of corona (a mistake anyone could make) I told him I ordered a corona lite, he brings a corona lite in a bottle. I again tell him I ordered a draft. 15 minutes later he comes back with the beer. Rude Alberto got mad at me because he can't listen. Takes our order and comes back after our food was delivered. Never saw him again. After we ate we waited another 15 minutes for him to come back for the check. We had to ask the manager for a check. Never saw Alberto again. We USED to come to the restaurant often but we won't be back. STAY AWAY FROM RUDE ALBERTO!"}
{"text":"Ahhh... The legendary Lindo Michoacan! Finally came here for the first time yesterday for my sister's graduation lunch after hearing so much about it from friends & coworkers.  As a party of 8 without reservations, we were seated surprisingly fast! Our table was towards the back, behind the bar area, in a room with several large windows with a spectacular view --- The entire restaurant sits cozily on a high hill, overlooking the suburbs and cityscape.  Service was quick & friendly as well. They're super slick with the chip & drink refills, which can be dangerous. I've always said that my one superpower is filling up on chips & salsa before my actual food gets there...  Anyway, it was a great experience! The normal entrees are pretty pricey (I would say $20 being the average), but they do have a margarita happy hour & a lunch menu that lasts until 5:00 PM with well over 20 options to choose from - a lot of them simply being cheaper, downsized versions of their dinner dishes."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, they have a really good selection and their prices are reasonable. This place is a hidden gem if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"i got serious food poisoning from the menudo. you always take a risk with meat...but damn! i won't be coming back to any of these locations."}
{"text":"Way over priced. Carne asada lacked flavor. You can always can tell how authentic the food will be by the salsa. The salsa was fresh out of the can. However the mojitos and fiedo soup where very good.  Casa don Juan restaurant is way better them this place."}
{"text":"great food great service wen have been to all locations but our fav is off Desert inn in lv"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican restaurants I have ever had the pleasure to dine in. I had the camerones sarandeados estilo and it was extraordinary. The staff in cluding Carolina was friendly and knowledgeable and when they saw me whip out my video she gave me a guided tour. It was a Friday night and they had this great Mariachi Band and they were fabulous, even stopping at my table to serenade our group with some Tijuana Brass music. I decided to have their signature dessert, fried ice cream. Instead I got this wonderful flambe ball of crushed nuts surrounding delicious vanilla ice cream swathed in caramel. I am soooo satisfied. If you get to this place you won't be disappointed, but get there early because they pack up after 7. I'm still licking my fingers. Oh! Did I mention the two moms in the taquiera? They were making fresh tortillas for everyone all evening and smiling as they did it?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Vegas. Over looks the whole strip from the top of mountain. Great service. Reasonable prices. Bomb good. Gauc is fire  tacos are bomb"}
{"text":"We been there four times and it's good except if you don't like your food floating in sauces then you need to order sauce on the side. We order the whole fish and each one came out over cooked or burnt. Another time we order burritos which were good but too much sauce on it. Chips and salsa is always good. Great view of the city that's why I have it 3 stars. Food is 2 stars. :("}
{"text":"This is a fabulous place.  There are hard to find any opportunities for improvement here.  The food was excellent, well spiced.  This not not \"Tex-Mex\" or \"Southwestern\".  Here you will find homemade taco shells fresh out of the fryer and a nicely textured masa on the tamale.  Meat was sliced or shredded, not minced.  Guacamole made table side to your specifications.  Food is spicy without being overbearing and there is more to the flavor to the profile than jalape√±o.  In fact, if I can handle it most people would say it's not \"hot\" enough for Mexican cuisine but I would suggest this is more authentic than what you find in many \"Mexican\" restaurants.  The only thing I wasn't over the moon with was the cheese enchilada which was good but a little on the oily side.  Really, it's hard not to get a cheese enchilada without a ton of oil on it anywhere.  Beyond that, the place is very clean and brightly decorated. It was large with plenty of room for large parties, very family friendly. Wait staff are extremely courteous and quick without being intrusive even during peak lunch hour when the place was really hopping.  Glasses never got empty, chip bowl never got empty of homemade tortilla chips.  Food came out quickly and hot.  Lunch for two with appetizer and teas $45 before tip and we left a lot of food behind because we weren't headed back to a place we could keep it cool.  If you are a lighter eater, consider sharing a plate, even at lunch."}
{"text":"favorite mexican restaurant to go with my mother service is always great there manager came around and checked on us as well as everyother table i would deff go back there again"}
{"text":"We used to love Lindo Michoacan! My go-to food is mexican.  It was Thursday night and we arrived around 11. Someone greeted us, and took us over to a table with a spectacular view.  We were starving so I ordered table side guac. It was fun to watch them prepare it. I am about to start to dig in the guac when I notice a HAIR in it. So grossed out I tell our bald waiter there's a hair in this guac. He grabs it to examine, and simply shrugs and says, \"oh that is just from the avocado peel.\"   REALLY? Since when do avocados have hair?  He hastily goes to make another. He really just seemed annoyed at the fact that I even asked. The rest of the dinner I sit there inspecting every bite.   I understand that sometimes small mistakes like this happen, but I felt the waiter (or manager, I couldn't tell who he was) could have handled this better. He seemed really annoyed that we asked them to re-make it.  Worst part of it all is that we had an $90 dollar meal, and they didn't even comp the guacamole.I'm not expecting a free meal but at least don't charge me for that hairy guacamole.   This dinner just left a bad taste in my mouth. I most likely will NOT return to that establishment."}
{"text":"Mexican food is probably my favorite and I really like Lindo.  I will admit that some things are a tad bland like the salsa and beans they serve with the chips but their entrees always make me happy!  I usually get either the chicken enchiladas or the bean and cheese burrito enchilada style smothered with sauce and cheese.  My boyfriend usually gets the veggie fajitas which are also pretty delicious.  The employees have always been pleasant and the place itself is in a nice area of town with awesome views of the strip"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY LOVE this place. First time here and I was very satisfied!  The food was delicious! The people are very nice & friendly! Can't forget the birthday shot  I will definitely like to come back!"}
{"text":"My family visits this location on occasion . Each and every time , we've had a wonderful experience . The service is prompt and the food is AMAZING . We love the chips, salsa and beans served before our meal . Authentic Mexican cuisine is a difficult thing to find in Las Vegas but I'm glad we're rather close to this location . If you're unsure of what to order , the combination #6 is EVERYTHING ."}
{"text":"This regards the Henderson, Nevada location. Yes, as good as it gets. The glowing reviews are spot on. Make a reservation and plan a few extra minutes for parking- plenty up and down the street if the lot is full.  We had a group of 13 for a special occasion on a Sunday evening. We made our reservation weeks in advance, but finished at the graduation earlier than expected- I called and they said come on in- an hour earlier than we had arranged. They had a beautiful table setup next to a large window- wow. The service was impeccable, even though the restaurant was obviously full to capacity, though not so loud that we couldn't carry on good conversation. Enthusiastic, always present, cheerful, helped by others as needed. What a treat! Had our drinks out in no time, delicious soup for all, and helped patiently take 13 dinner orders, delivered surprisingly quickly, fresh, hot, delicious, just as ordered. The waiter (Erick) checked on us regularly, kept chips, salsa water and margarita glasses full throughout. They even festively serenaded the graduate! Everybody had a wonderful time, all at a fair price. So appreciative of this great spot, obviously well managed, with happy and efficient employees, nice \"small touches\" and spectacular views. Absolutely worth the drive, recommended!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great food, great atmosphere, and good prices for the incredible view of the strip.  All the shrimp dishes are delish.  Try either the beef or pork with Coca-Cola sauce, if you are Coke fan.  Parking is a pain during prime hours, but that is only because this place is so popular.  You will always eventually find a parking spot, there just might be a little bit of walk to the restaurant.  Once you get inside, you will realize it was worth the distractions."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant I've been to in Vegas. Has the best in high end liquor (Don Julio 1942, Corralejo, Ambhar, etc) Food was great. Will def be one of must while coming!"}
{"text":"This is not an authentic Mexican restaurant. The beans tasted like can beans. The salsa was tomato and onions no flavor. I did have lobster and that was ok. The chilaquiles were awful."}
{"text":"Looking for the best Mexican food in Vegas?  Look no further. Authentic is the best was to describe this place. They don't take reservations, so expect a wait. I'm looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Arrived on a weekday early evening around 5 pm. Their was plenty of strip booths available but the hostesses said they were reserved. Never again will I dine here, hostesses are saving best seats for their Hispanic friends, they treat Caucasians very bad here, so many better choices for Mexican food in  Las Vegas and Henderson.  Very unsatisfied yours, Michael  local in Henderson nv"}
{"text":"Love the food and also the area.   This place is the shit. Love that they leave you alone to actually eat.  This place is always busy and I understand why."}
{"text":"Best GUACAMOLE EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. They make it right in front of you! You can add or take away anything you'd like! Their salsa needs a little work, but the guac is worth the trip. On Sundays, they have a buffet that has TONS of food really cheap! My husband says Lindo has the BEST fish tacos ANYWHERE (and we've been to a few places...) If you're lucky enough to hit a night when the \"1 man mariachi\" is there, he's great!"}
{"text":"My first time here starting from the atmosphere to the service and food was excellent. Chips , salsa, beans and fideo for starters while waiting for your food a great touch . I came for my birthday and fathers day best  experience they sang to me and gave me a shot of tequilla . You will definitely see me here again with my family .High 5 to the waiter Edgar and staff ."}
{"text":"So the view is still great, but we went on a Tuesday night and the service was super slow and the staff seemed very confused.  Had to order drinks three times as the guy at the bar kept getting the order mixed up..... the food is tasty, good traditional Mexican."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food in a nice atmosphere.  Great views of the city.  Every item I have had (over ten visits) has been wonderful.  Complete full bar and every ingredient is fresh.  Very good service.  You can't go wrong here.  Las Vegas residents are spoiled with high quality Mexican food everywhere.  You cannot get this quality anywhere in Florida.  Enjoy your good fortune.  \"Save water, drink beer.\""}
{"text":"So great! The food was so good and the waiter was super nice! I love how they bring fideo to your table! Prices are steep but food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is festive and I think that that is their main selling point. The food is mediocre at best. I've really wanted to like this place and I've been back about 4 times. Many years ago when I first moved to Las Vegas, the food knocked your socks off. The salsa ect was spucy and full of flavor. They have changed so much. For Mexican food they're overpriced. The best thing they have is there fresh-made guacamole because you can have it spiced however you like it. Everything else I've ordered in the last few years is incredibly bland. I really wanted to like this place Now it seems they are charging for the atmosphere and a Mexican experience but the food is not authentic and delicious anymore. They have dulled down the flavor and made a vanilla brand of Mexican food. It isn't awful but I prefer Mexican food they way they used to make it. This generic flavor as of late is not for me."}
{"text":"This place is awesome they always take care of us along with everybody else, we always come out here for our anniversary, the Bartenders, waiters, Hostess, everyone else who works there are always very friendly, the food is excellent and a fun atmosphere...... even more awesome when the Mariachis play Friday and weekend nights.......other music also during the week. A must go to place you have to come and enjoy when your out in Vegas......"}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner tonight and I was underwhelmed (sadly). The food was good for the most part but it was the service that was a major letdown.   One of the \"drinks\" we ordered, a simple glass of ice, never came. I even asked a second time but it did me no good. We also never got our sopa de fideo that comes with each meal. After our dinner arrived we saw very little of our waiter. Honestly the bus boy gave better service and more of it. Had to wait for the check too. In extreme circumstances this may be understandable but it didn't even seem like the place was packed.   The saving grace was the food. Both the pork and chicken were tasty. I also enjoyed the salsa verde and my family seemed to enjoy their meals. They were a little skimpy on the rice and beans and the guacamole lacked some flavors IMO (salt, lime, cilantro) but it wasn't anything worth fussing over. It's a shame that the service was such a letdown. Good food + bad service = a poor dining experience. Bummer..."}
{"text":"4 star food, 2 star service.  The servers are stretched very thin, sometimes its very hard to understand them, and the service is just plain slow.  Takes a long time to get refills, your order taken, your food, etc..  Food portions are good and my BF and I have always enjoyed what we ordered.  Their food did make me sick once which is why food isn't 5 stars.  View of Vegas is great, however this place is a little on the noisy side for me"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this is the convention center location, but my review is for that location.   Despite a HUGE convention, there was a very short line at lunch time. The ladies behind the counter were super nice.  The food... taste-wise I felt like I wasted calories. It filled the void, but didn't really satisfied the taste buds.  Just meh."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service today! I'm by myself and they convinced me to sit at the bar for faster service and I've been sitting here for 17 min and they still haven't taken my order. I had to stop the hostess to ask who's taking my order. Finally bartender came over only 3 people at the bar.. that's not good service! To be fair the food is very good!"}
{"text":"Festive atmosphere as soon as you walk in. Family oriented. Great food and service. As soon as I sat down we were asked for our drink order. The chips and bean/salsa dip was good. I had so much food I could not eat it all and took the rest home for supper. If you are a veteran or military you get 50% off!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time to celebrate my daughters birthday- great food and view! Will be back to try lunch!"}
{"text":"I'm a stickler when it comes to customer service. Lindo Michoacan in Vegas has got it right. From the moment we walked into the restaurant, til the moment we left. We were treated to a great dining experience. Once in a while you will run into a place like this. I'm glad I did. So attentive and on the ball. All smiles no matter what any of us threw at the staff. Mind you we were a wedding party of about 50 people. They were prepared and handled our very large group with ease. Now, the food. Just a touch on the bland side. Not to worry though. There was plenty of salsa and seasoning on the table to spice things up. Normally, I would be critical about ok bland food. But this review is about the restaurant as a whole. If the food was better it would've gotten 5 stars. It's an easy fix. Don't be afraid of salt in the kitchen guys. It's our friend most times. Lindo Michoacan is a great restaurant. Go there. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but not great. Not worth the wait nor the bad service we received. My order was okay but they messed up my wife's simple order of bean and cheese chimichanga, twice."}
{"text":"It took me one bite of the salsa to know that the food, no matter what I ordered was going to be great.  I live in San Diego, which is fairly close to Mexico, and as such, has plenty of good Mexican food, so when it's bad or average, I'm going to recognize it. My personal theory is that the farther you get from Mexico, the worse the Mexican food becomes. I don't normally write reviews, and the reason I'm writing the review isn't because of the great food, it's because of the extra mile they went.  Actually, probably quite a few extra miles. More on that later.  Initially, I wasn't so sure I was going to love it as I knew nothing about it other than our friends had chosen it after some research and the shuttle was coming to get us(a group of 9) at the Aria(new hotel, central on the strip). A word of advice for anyone staying @ the Aria: good luck having a shuttle pick you up. This hotel \"has two main entrances\". Seriously, they both might as well be main entrances. This will no doubt cause some confusion for any shuttle driver coming to get you. As a result, we were off to a late start.  The story of the restuarant is kind of cool. Apparently the guy learned to cook the Michoacan style from nuns at a semenary. Transalation: authentico!  I don't even know the name of what I ordered. \"Linda's plate\" or something.  It's basically chicken w/ a specially prepared sauce.  It was fantastic.  Quite a few of the dishes appear to feature specialized sauces. I won't even go more into the details of the food than to see we all loved what we ordered, and much of what's on the menu is unique and not something you can find anywhere else, or at least, do not often find, or when you do it's \"just ok\". When in doubt, as your server, they will not lead you wrong.  Other highlights include the Mariachi band which played 4 songs for our group. They were great, and are something that I personally love. Reminds me of being a gringo tourist for some reason.  The reason for the review, however was the service. everyone was friendly, but where they really went the extra mile is that one of the members of our group had forgotten her purse in the shuttle on the return trip, but she didn't realize it until after the shuttle was already on the way back to the restuarant.  In case you are not aware, Las Vegas is probably the worst city in the world to run out of money.  Losing your purse it kind of a big deal. They have our sincerest gratitude for finding the purse(with everything in it of course) and droving all the way back to the Aria just to drop it off for us and save us the cab fare it would have required to get it. For that, we thank them, and for that, they get a glowing review.  To summarize: Totally worth going.  It is not always easy to find good Mexican food, and this place has great Mexican food.If you have questions on the menu, ask the staff and enjoy whatever it is they give you.  They will definately take care of you."}
{"text":"I always take my daughter. They have such a great family atmosphere and fab food. It doesn't matter if it's family time or girls night out. It's always a fun time."}
{"text":"An authentic Mexican restaurant in Henderson. My brother recommended we try this place for dinner while we were in town visiting him. We were seated immediately and our waiter quickly brought us fresh chips and salsa and took our drink orders. I ordered a strawberry margarita that was ok. After we placed our orders, the staff brought out the appetizer soup. For my entree I ordered the steak picado, but was not impressed. My brother, on the other hand, ordered the steak ranchero which was really good. If I could do it all over again, I'd probably order that instead."}
{"text":"Awe man absolutely love this place. The views from the dining room are awesome!!! The table side guacamole is a must order. Had the taco meal and it was excellent. Also had bulldog margarita which was good! Make sure to get it on the rocks! Blended didn't taste too good in my opinion. Gets really busy so a 25 minute wait is about normal during the peak times of dinner."}
{"text":"Good food with the most awsome view of the strip at night. Margaritas and Mariachi make for a great dinner spot."}
{"text":"The parking lot is not representative of the population inside. We parked up the street and got in within 10 minutes of putting our name down at 7:30pm on a Saturday. The staff were all courteous and helpful; meals came out quick (despite the staff constantly checking the USA vs. Mexico Soccer game that was going on, it was apparently a big deal. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, just impressive multitasking).   The food is excellent. Nothing bizarre, leans more authentic than most \"authentic\" Mexican places, but just quality versions of familiar food. I would trust the steak and seafood here. The guacamole being made in front of you is amazing, and it allows your to steal the recipe (it also appears to be a lot of work)   Our waiter, Rene, was on the ball and had quality suggestions. The Mango Mojitos ARE spectacular. The other busing staff executed excellently. My Cadillac Margarita was almost too strong. Which is how I like it.   SUPER MEGA BONUS: The first Mariachi Band that did not annoy me. Not only did they do a splendid job of traditional tunes, they had a delightful version of Charlie Daniel's Devil goes down to Georgia (I am not a hillbilly; it was just a good rendition.) and at no point did they beg for tips or get intrusive. Excellent stuff."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a few times. Never has been anything special but feel like quality was lower tonight. Drinks very weak with bad mix, table side guacamole with way too much lime, waiter drops fork on floor than picks it up and puts back by my daughter, lastly food very mediocre. Need better Mexican in Henderson!"}
{"text":"The pollo sarandeado is absolutely amazing!  It has so much flavor I could eat it everyday.  The service is also very good during the busy lunchtime."}
{"text":"Ive been going to this place ever since it opened. I love it and recommend it to anyone that wants to have a good time and good food."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! The food is very good. Lunch or dinner, come with a big appetite because they start off with sopa de fideos (noodle soup) and fresh tortilla chips with beans. We always order guacamole to start. My 3 favorite things here are the flautas, the steak with green chiles and cheese enchilada and the shrimp ceviche they call it ensalada marinara. And for dessert, make sure to try the fried ice cream!! Yum!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks with friends! Really recommend you to come here. The view of Las Vegas from here it's great.  Good relax to and enjoy a good Mexican food."}
{"text":"I dont Eat much Mexican Food But Boy was it Good and Really Authentic Food A little On the pricey Side and Awesome Customer Service and they make you feel welcomed havent been here for a while but i this town they are Big and Would Recomended Going With Friends or Family for A Good Night Out"}
{"text":"They were extremely kind to us on my anniversary and even gave us the choice of a couple of tables when we called ahead of time. Anyone who has been here knows how busy it gets so having the choice of where to sit made a very good impression on me. They made the evening extra special with the addition of churros and tequila (can't really go wrong there!). My only reason for taking away 1 star is because some of the items on the menu could be a little better. I've had better chili relleno at other places. I would definitely go back though...their margaritas are the best!"}
{"text":"5 stars for an outstanding Mexican authentic restaurant.  After spending lots of time (and money) on The Strip during our most recent trip to Vegas, my wife and I were looking to find something a little more authentic and local. After getting a tip from tour guide about a place called Lindo Michoacan that was \"a little out of the way,\" we decided to look it up on Yelp. After reading a few reviews with words like \"favorite Mexican\" and \"best in Vegas,\" we knew we had found the right place and headed over.  Lindo Michoacan, which is located on Desert Inn Road between 515 and Eastern Avenue, is a large stand alone venue with a large horse statute standing outside to greet you in. We went inside and found a packed venue that can be best described as being a mixture of a hole in the wall and a large beautiful Mexican restaurant. I know those sound like polar opposites, but this venue pulls it off well.  We were seated at our table and our server came over to bring us menus and say hello. He was very friendly, gave us great recommendations and, despite being very busy, was great about checking up on us throughout the meal. While other service we received in Vegas may have been technically better, his passion, hustle and friendliness made for some of the best service we received in Vegas.  After looking over the venue's massive menu, we put in an order for a couple margaritas (I got one that our server described as the \"Cadillac of margaritas\") to start. Our margaritas came out relatively quickly and were both tasty and strong, something both me and my wife greatly appreciated.   As we were working on our margaritas, one of the servers brought out some chips and dip. The chips were some of the best chips I've had at a Mexican restaurant in a while, and the dark green bean dip was outstanding. The server also brought out the Queso Fundido (with lobster meat) that we ordered due to our waiter's strong recommendation. The appetizer was absolutely fantastic and served as another excellent dipping option for our chips...to the point we were getting full before our entrees had even made it out!  Fortunately, the waiter waited a little while before bringing out our main dishes. Once they came out, the sight and smell of them renewed our appetites. I ordered the Carnitas a la Coca Cola (once again based on the waiter's recommendation). It came with refried beans, a guac salad and veggies in place of the rice. The carnitas were absolutely delicious in that they were sweet, tender, juicy and just overall excellent. The veggies were also great and the guac salad made for another dipping option for our chips. My wife loved her food as well, and the only bad part was our stomachs were running out of room. Fortunately, we were able to box up our food, get the check (all for less than $70! what a steal compared to the rest of Vegas) and head out to catch our flight.   Overall, Lindo Michoacan is a fantastic authentic Mexican restaurant. The fun atmosphere, excellent service and top notch food make this one of Vegas' must-try restaurants."}
{"text":"Honestly my favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. The service is superb. The food is on point; authentic & the closest thing to what we cook at home.   Their organic margarita (slushee) so tasty. I recommend their Chile rellenos or their Machaca con Huevo; enchiladas de mole are cool; the sauce really depends on the chef that is cooking it. Sometimes \"meh\" another time \"YASS!\"   Everyone is awesome ! Jaime and Omar & Javier are my favorites. The manager Edgar is the most kindest and caring manager I have ever met running a business. He truly cares about all his guests, and goes above and beyond to ensure everyone enjoys their experience in the restaurant.  I love the music, the ambient. Truly authentic. I come here at least 4 times a month. This is the ONLY location I go to, because honestly, the others are so boring and the customer service is poor   && when it is your birthday, the whole crew comes to your table to sing you a bday song; put a sombrero on you & bring you a little treat !! 21+ get a tequila shot too!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here a few days before Valentine's Day to celebrate.  It was fantastic.  I can't help but always order the shrimp-stuffed chili rellenos every single time.  I try to order something else, but it never works out.  They are so good!  My husband had the coca-cola steak (I don't remember the name that it is listed as on the menu).  The flavor is so good!  Yes, I snuck a bite.  The chips and salsa were good - the salsa wasn't too hot (which has only happened once).  The service was good.  I will go back and try to order something new, but will probably not succeed."}
{"text":"Met several old colleagues here for lunch today.  It was the first time I've been to this location, so I was kind of excited to give it a try.  The location is conveniently located off the 215 & Flamingo Rd.....so it was easy access for me and them.  The traditional Lindo's Chips & Salsa is served here, complimentary.  It has the same fresh, awesome taste as the other locations.  Good start.  After browsing the menu for a little while, I settled on the Lunch Special #3 \"Tres\".....Beef Chimichanga.  I was going to order a Dos XX or a Pacifico, but since my friends were on lunch from work, I didn't want to throw it in their face that I can drink at lunch and they can't....so I abstained and had an Iced Tea.  The food came out pretty fast.  The Chimichanga comes with Rice, Beans, and Sour Cream & Guacamole on the side.  It was cooked just right.....the fried Tortilla was crispy, flaky, and not greasy.  The Beef was shredded and full of flavor.  I like to get their signature Salsa and pour it on top of the Chimichanga....because the Salsa packs a lot of heat and has that Smoky Chipotle flavor to it.  I mixed the Beans & Rice together and devoured the plate.  The service was excellent and everyone had a good time.  We spent an hour after lunch talking and catching up on stuff.....even though we settled our bill, the server ensured our glasses were full and that everyone was ok.  It's the signature service I've come to know and love about Lindo and his restaurants....glad to see it was the same here.  Will I return?  Of course!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic! The only reason I didn't rate with 5 stars is because the wait staff can be a little short sometimes. They aren't rude, they just don't have that pleasant demeanor one would hope for.  But nevertheless, I continue to return because the food is sooo good!"}
{"text":"The avocado tacos are AMAZING.  The veggie fajitas are also pretty good as well.  Really good, solid Mexican place that we go to every time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food is good.  3 choice of salsa.  Margaritas could be bigger.   Very clean.  Big dining area."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a friend. Read the reviews and thought, wow this place must really be good!  I thought the staff was great. The 2 stars are based on the food.  Rarely do I use the salt and pepper shakers. The rice was so bland I had to. How do you mess up rice? The chips came with a bean dip and red salsa. That was kind of different since most Mexican restaurants only offer a red salsa. I ordered the chili relleno. Pretty basic, nothing special. My kids had the enchiladas. And my wife ordered taquitos. They didn't finish their dishes and when we took it to go we ended up throwing it in the trash.   I have a feeling the great reviews are coming from tourists that haven't had awesome Mexican food. Maybe the same people that think even Taco Bell is real Mexican food. Haha  Anyways, I gave the place a try and will never go back.   If you still want to give the place a try. Order 1 thing, before making a big order."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I'm less and less impressed by the food. I normally order something a la Coca Cola because those dishes have been my favourite so far. Decided to venture into the lunch special menu for a tostada. Extremely disappointed. If I want a fried tortilla bowl filled with a little beans and meat and packed full of ice berg lettuce, I can find somewhere else to get it a hell of a lot cheaper. It was all lettuce. Ridiculous.  Lindo needs to step up their game. Food is more bland every time, service a little slower. Oh, and their table side guacamole. Can we talk about the amount of onions?! Lord Almighty, it was like I had a little avocado in my onions!   Not impressed lately. Will be a while before I come back here."}
{"text":"My partner and I tried the Bonito Michoacan on Decatur a few days before we had a family invite here and I wasn't so impressed, so I thought it would be interesting to try a different Michoacan & might lead to a better experience. Unfortunately I was wrong. Pros first - What I DID like about this place is that it was very open and bustling, but all the while not too noisy that you couldn't enjoy the company you were with. It's in a perfect location too so you can see the city with the strip in the distance, which was really gorgeous. That's where the 2 stars came from. Cons - The good thing about Bonitos for me was the drinks, but unfortunately we weren't offered a drinks menu or anything other than water the whole time we were there. Really disappointing. Then the food. We went for the enchiladas and the carne asada. I was really hoping for something less gloopy and saucy this time after the poor experience at Bonitos, but.. nope! Another school dinner for us! The enchiladas were covered and it was all a bit bland and heavy. The carne asada was totally dry and going cold when we got it. We had to douse it in salsa verde so it would go down, but of course that made the whole thing cold. No check backs, so as it was edible we made do. It was a great evening in all because of the company we were with, but that had nothing to do with Lindos. Will not be returning to any of the Michoacans, if you're looking for Mexican cuisine, there is a lot better around the valley in my opinion."}
{"text":"Good food presented nicely! Fresh tasty guacamole made right in front of you! If you're looking for some authentic Mexican food this is a great spot to try out. Tasted familiar to my  mama's home cooking back in California. She was born in Michoacan."}
{"text":"I can't begin to tell you what a great time we had at Lindo Michoacan. The best wait staff you would ever want to serve you and Victor the manager was the greatest, he became our new best friend. The food was as great as the employees I can't say enough good things about this restaurant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My go to Mexican restaurant -- fabulous very attentive service . Spacious restaurant with a patio to sit outside on a gorgeous vegas day ! Try a banana/ raspberry swirl margarita. We love the chicken fajitas and the Zamora combo ( green chili pork guacamole burrito .. Yum) !!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it 5 stars for the view and the liveliness. The food is slightly above average, but the ambiance is certainly festive and alive. I love bringing friends here and make it a point to come here at least twice a month."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Loved the chile rellenos. Great chips with bean dip and variety of salsas. Pricey as far as Mexican food goes, but the food, service, and atmosphere were excellent, and the portions are huge. Get a table by the windows for a gorgeous view. It is a little chilly there if it's a cool evening, so dress accordingly, but worth it. Even had a great kids menu. Service got a little slower as the evening got later and they got very busy, so if you bring kids, I recommend getting there earlier in the evening. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"It is a great place to go there and relax and have a great meal at any time, I like the restaurant a lot but I'm been setting at the bar and and have the greatest service from Deodara and Analy.  Go there have a great time"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican food experiences I've had in the US.  Chips, salsa, beans - BOMB.  Sopa de fideos - BOMB.  And the menu options are ridiculous.  The ultimate in tasty food.  LOVE Lindo Michoacan!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place won awards. I ordered the chicken mole enchiladas. The sauce was sweet and bland. The texture of the chicken was all wrong, like it was made with sauteed fajita strips instead of shredded poached chicken. The rice and beans were flavorless. The complimentary bowl of noodle soup tasted like nothing but MSG."}
{"text":"Hands down best view and best Mexican restaurant I have been to in greater Las Vegas area.  They give you chips, beans and salsa when you are seated.  Their horchata is the best I have ever had, like ever.  I also get the Ensalada Marinara, which is shrimp, avocado, tomato, onions, cilantro, jalapenos and lime juice inside two avocado shells.  Amazing!!!  They do fun birthday songs with sombreros, cake and tequila shots.  The atmosphere is very welcoming and fun.  And you just can't beat the view."}
{"text":"This spot is an absolute must!! Awesome food drinks and great for kids. Love the decor throughout. Highly recommend for great authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant yesterday. We're new to area and are looking for an authentic Mexican food restaurant. The staff was attentive and I really liked their professional appearance. The chimichanga I ordered was barely warm, the cheese was not completely melted. The usual \"careful, hot plate \" was not accurate. My husbands dish had the same disappointing description, not nearly warm enough. I doggie bagged my chimichanga so I could heat it up at home to enjoy. Not sure I would try again. Still searching...."}
{"text":"I think this is the longest I have ever waited to be seated WITH a reservation. We had a reservation for 7:30pm for a party of 5. I am not making this up, but we waited close to an hour to be seated; we didn't walk out because we had a 20 min taxi drive from the Vegas Strip. So we would have wasted 40 mins n $. We kept asking how much longer and they would ignored us or just say a \"few more mins,\" we just have tables for smaller groups\" etc. Finally, we got seated at a booth for 4 people!; all they did was pull up a chair! Like seriously?! They couldn't do that from the beginning? If all they have are booths and tables minimum parties of 4. That's why I'm giving it a 3 stars. The food was just ok, the guayaba margaritas were delicious and the waiter was awesome.  They need to work on their reservation system or just don't have that option because it's just waste of time."}
{"text":"Too many skanky drunks. Laughing because they think they are cute in front old geezers that think they can get some, but instead they suffer from whiskey di*#  The food is mediocre. The servers are great. The staff is great. They just have to serve the food. No where near the quality of the original on D.I.   Bad move seating a family next to obnoxious drunks. Know your audience. I cannot wait to get the Hell out of this place. Great view, though."}
{"text":"I remember loving this place a couple years back. This time around was not as impressive. I'm not exactly sure what the food lacked: maybe balance, fresh produce, quality seafood. The flavors were not as great as I remembered. Would only be back for a late night drink if I wanted to avoid a sports bar."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was back in the 90's and was one of my favorite spots. I then moved away, moved back into the Valley, but across town. I would always go to a different location, simply because of the distance. I STILL LOVE this place. Food is fantastic. There seems to always be a line, but they move people in and out so fast, it really is not much a wait. The place is loud, but the great thing about this place...as opposed to their Horizon Ridge location...the rooms are contained and it feels more family like, rather than a bunch of loud, old Frat boys that just came off of  the golf course and think they are still tapping the keg. PLEASE! Do yourself a favor and try this place. You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"This place will always be my go to Mexican restaurant. We prefer sitting at the bar overlooking the beautiful view of the Vegas strip. I enjoy their Micheladas and table side fresh guacomole. We normally come here for a few drinks and appetizers.--Also, the bartenders are very nice & accommodating."}
{"text":"Pre-Yelp days this used to be our go to spot after work for some margaritas. I don't make it here as much as I used to, as there are several other places in the neighborhood we choose to go now. The food and drinks here seem to be inconsistent. This goes for the other Michoacan properties here in town. I used to frequent the Flamingo/I215 one for happy hour, but the drinks are so hit or miss, we stopped going. I love the chips & salsa and bean dip here, and I used to be a huge fan of the tableside guac, but my last visit, it tasted he put an entire onion in the guac, I couldn't taste anything else. So I started adding stuff to it to doctor it up, salsa, salt, whatever I could. Didn't work. Margaritas are hit or miss. If you get a decent bartender who understands \"I don't want triple sec or grand marnier\" they can be pretty good, I hate artifical tasting margarita mix. Will I continue to go here? Probably, just stick the usual and don't stray from the chips & salsa & bean dip."}
{"text":"El mejor restaurante mexicano de Las Vegas y el servicio por parte del mesero Roger el cubano excelente, muy lindo lugar y la comida excelente"}
{"text":"We had not been to this Lindo location in about a year.  I remember why.  The service is crazy slow and the food is just average (and a little overpriced).  I ordered the tacos (2 shredded beef, one chicken).  The chicken was so dry I didn't eat much of it and the shredded beef tacos dripped grease.  The beef itself was very flavorful though.  The rice was also very dry.  I know people love this place, but the original on DI seems to have a better kitchen.  The upside to this location is the mass amounts of flat screen TV's and yummy margaritas.  We were able to watch the AFC Championship game just as well as we could have in any bar or sports book."}
{"text":"This place is decent. I took my order to go, so I can't comment on the restaurant itself. The food was good though. It was about as good as any other Mexican restaurant. One particular thing I liked about this place was the Pollo llora hor, llora manana. It was the spiciest dish I have ever had! I loved this dish with the rest of the meal, but I did not care for the taste of the ghost chilis. They have kind of a burnt taste. However, mixed with the beans and rice this dish is delicious. Just be sure to keep a powerful antacid near by for afterwards! That chicken is no joke!"}
{"text":"Leo is an amazing manager. Joy is an amazing bartender. Oswaldo is an amazing server. With these three, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"the view is better than the food... mojitos were a close 2nd food tasted to greesy. Good fresh guac"}
{"text":"The family used to love this place, but sadly it's falling off of our favorites list. We visited last night for dinner. We arrived about 6:15p and was told the wait was about 15 min. 30 min later we were seated.   The service was not good. My table had ordered their drinks, but I couldn't remember the name of what I wanted and had to wait for the server to get me a cocktail menu. 15 min after I finally ordered my drink, I had to ask the server where it was.   The food has slowly gotten worse while the prices continue to rise. My favorite dish has always been the Camarones Sarandeados. It's my \"go to\" meal there. They used to serve 5-6 large shrimp but now you get 7-8 much smaller shrimp for $3 more. The sauce is very oily now and it lacks the flavor it used to.   Everyone who lives in the Henderson area knows that this restaurant is very popular with very limited parking and long waits. It would be nice if they would accept reservations. Over all, I hope the service and food improves or my family will need to find another Mexican restaurant to frequent."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas with my fianc√© for 3 days and decided to stop by here for breakfast on our second day. It was such a great experience we came back the next day for lunch. Great food and great service. Very friendly staff, and everything tastes so fresh. Very generous portions, fair prices. If you're in town you must stop by!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday afternoon and sat in the bar area which was quiet. You have to try the lobster taquito appetizer which was amazing. Pacific lobster surprised me very much. The bartender (female from Chicago but moved out here) was great and prompt with her service. We also ordered the Shrimp Campechana and added some great salsa verde and a wonderful habanero spicy sauce. Great Tequila selection and just a fun place overall. Will be back pronto! Topped off with Cheesecake, delicioso:)"}
{"text":"Wife's boss recommended, hands down best food, taste, service and price. No negatives what so ever. Guacamole made tableside in front of you! Probably going back before we go home...That good!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican I've ever had!   The chips come with salsa and beans that are actually quite delightful. The menu is extensive, which is a bit overwhelming. I had the chicken flautas and they were delicious! We also got the tableside guacamole which was sheer perfection. The drinks are hearty and the entre√©s come with a side of fideo soup. I had never experienced fideo before, but it's absolutely something I will be adding to our carousel of homey meals."}
{"text":"I found this to be a very authentic Mexican restaurant, with a very lovely atmosphere.  The waiters and waitresses were 100% on the ball.  Look at the photos of my drink, never went more than half full.  Chips and salsa were always full too.  Plenty of food and it was the real deal as far as the food goes.  Would definitely come back again.  When it comes to service, food, and taste this restaurant scored the 5/5 which is why I will come back.  The only small drawback was the loud music."}
{"text":"Excellent food - great service - Funky Pimp Juice   I ate here over the weekend with the help my favorite Chowhounder (see: http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=4TByNfzySEQ0K9nglTaJzQ ) - Jim C..  He seems to find the gems with the help of the obscure tools of the chowhound site...  Pros:   Awesome tasty food Great service - Noe Rocks! Live music (Friday night) Locals, locals, locals...  Cons: weak margaritas  Highly recommended!  For out-of-towners this is worth the drive or the cab-ride!  more laters..."}
{"text":"YUM!  YUM! YUM!  Real Mexican Food!  Felt like I was in Mexico!  :)  This place is excellent at many levels.  Ask for a table at the window and over look the strip at night!  Gorgeous View!  The Frozen Strawberry Margaritas \"BUZZ\"  Don't drink to many! I got buzzed off one, Yea, I know, a cheap date! LOL   The atmosphere is very Mexican and the staff is very professional! A-1 Service!  Sometimes you hear a live Mexican group playing and also for Birthdays!  Get out the shots, Yum!  The chips, tacos, beans rice were Fabulous!  Very Filling, Very Tasty, Very Warm, and the presentation was Awesome!  Been there a few times!  A must go for all, family, friends, loved ones, birthdays and that Hot Date! :)"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I have ever had...anywhere...ever! The chips and bean dip are good. Fajitas are amazing. Delicious home made tortillas. Table side guacamole is a must. Carnitas are yummy. They have a good Mexican Cobb salad too.  I am not a big fan of their margaritas, they taste a little like cheap tequila to me but I have gone with 3 other people who love them so it must be I am used to sugary low on tequila margaritas. We are always too full for desert but I plan on trying it sometime.  I will admit there are a few things there I do not like. Their salsa is too spicy for me and my boyfriend but we are wusses. I ordered chicken tacos a la carte before and they weren't any good, hardly any flavor. I ordered something when I was drunk which I thought was going to be like Pollo a La Crema but it was not and it tasted slimey and almost made me puke, but it was an authentic Mexican dish and I was a drunk white girl.  It is all in what you order. Great service, very friendly, and fast. This is the only Mexican restaurant I will go to."}
{"text":"This place always gluts above and beyond! I love the flour tortilla taco shells but couldn't ever get them right. After 2 attempts the manager came out, talked to me,brought out exactly what I wanted, and told me for to order it in the future.   Such great food, such great service... every single time!"}
{"text":"Love this place the food is always great .. The service is excellent... I'm never disappointed... One of my fav places .. Two thumbs ups once again"}
{"text":"The absolute best place ever to have Mexican food .. The food is fantastic and so is the service .. I  this place !!!!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. I thought was another Mexican restaurant aiming to served only to the American clientele but they truly have some traditional dishes. The bar has a great view of the mountains, and the city, including the strip. Looking forward to visit some other day at night. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I want the bus boy Ulysses and my server oops forgot his name, to be there always. I'll pay em...  This place rocks. The decor is lovely. The music is great and the initial salsa they provide is hot! Or I'm just really white. For one I didn't order Margaritas and just focused on the food. I had Chipotle Chicken and it was the best. Superb. And though they were busy the bus boy made sure I was happy. Thank YOU!  A friend recommended this place to me and now I recommend it you! You will love this place."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a long time ago, but today's service was AMAZING! We were a group of 14 and they took care of us so well. Our chips and dips were always filled as well as our drinks! The food came out promptly and was also delicious. I was so impressed with how patient the staff was (my family and family friends are pretty needy lol).This location was awesome and so were the staff! We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Good but not great. BUT its a solid place if your wanting mexican food with variety. The Guacamole is typically AMAZING and one of our go to's. But this time it was chunky and lacked flavor, especially for $9.00. We got a Carne Asada Taco, Chimichanga, Enchaladas and rolled tacos. No real complaints but it could have been better. Service was great and attentive, place was kept clean and our water was always full."}
{"text":"Service GREAT!  But I've had better food in jail.  Nice view.  Speedy, Friendly and very kind but seriously so blah!"}
{"text":"I bought the Groupon and little far from our house, but the review and my friends were talking about this place made me to buy this deal, Wholaa!! i though this place is not great food when i was parking my car in the parking lot bcos of the old looking front view, Believe me, this place is the best Mexican food so far i tried. we were 7 people and all of us were so happy about the service and the food. Only thing is the loud sound in side, but i can understand the Mexican tradition, and the loud music always go together.  Such a great place to get the authentic Mexican food, My favorite was Stake Ranchero, Also My wife got Chicken Fajita was Delisious!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic style food that is as close to Cali Mexican food you are going to get while in Vegas! Was totally having withdrawals until we found this place! Now it is my guilty pleasure when dieting is not on my mind! Going here for a birthday is super fun too because they put this sombrero on the birthday person and make them take a shot while singing and playing musical instruments! Everything happens so fast it almost is like a funny mariachi dream! Love love love their deep fried hard-shelled tacos and enchiladas."}
{"text":"I've come to this location or another many a times but never gave a review. Today I came in to treat my Mom to a Father's Day lunch. We got here at around 11:30am to beat the lunch rush and glad we did. Figured it would be a hot spot for Father's Day. By 12:15pm and almost done with our lunch, the place was packed. We could barely hear ourselves think. Good for them!   The staff was really nice and attentive. Something that I appreciate. Where it missed the mark was the food. I have never left here or any other Lindo location raving about the meal, so I knew what I was getting walking into the door. I wanted my Mom to try it out to see if I were just being too picky in comparison to my other favorite Mexican restaurant. The chips and salsa were amazing and the highlight of the meal. I got the veggie burritos and Mom got the chicken chimichanga. While both were pretty good, we had both had better elsewhere.  At the end of the day, if you are looking for true, authentic Mexican food, I don't think this place will do it for you. At least it doesn't do it for me. I like the true, authentic feel other Mexican restaurants have given me with a more intimate setting. This place is built to accommodate the masses, which leads me to believe that something is bound to be off if there's a full house."}
{"text":"My brother and I loved this place. Gorgeous view, excellent food quality and perfect service. Get the quac, they make it fresh at the table. We had the sopitos and the ensalada marinera, simply awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite spot to take family and friends who come to visit! The food is delicious. I love the vegetable fajitas! They are amazing. We love the view of the strip and it is truly a magnificent view. Good views and good food. This place is fantastic. Plus it is open late! Very busy at dinner time as one would expect. We prefer to come for dinner a little later when it is quieter, and not so many Birthdays around. Make reservations so you don't have to wait ;)"}
{"text":"It's been a couple of years since we've been here and we wanted to do something different.  Dinner comes with fideo soup, rice, beans, and choice of corn or flour tortillas.  My wife had the chicken Celestina, a chicken breast with black and green olives, and almond slices cooked in garlic, lime and wine.  I had the chicken Rebeca, also a chicken breast but with cooked with fresh cactus strips, onions, cilantro, and cubed tomatoes with a bit of chopped jalape√±o.    We both enjoyed our dishes.  I was surprised that my wife liked the almond in her dish.  She's generally been averse to such additions to food.  Imagine my surprise!  I enjoyed the cactus with my chicken.  Both dishes had good flavors of fresh ingredients.  For dessert, we had their chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.  It was more than enough for two people. The cake was a round shaped and was filled with a liquid chocolate and was much like a lava cake.  The ice cream had caramel drizzled on top.  I'm not sure why we don't come here more often.  It's close to home and it's very good.  Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. This place was packed. But I have to say the food had no flavor. The margaritas were amazing. The service was ok, had to keep looking around for someone to refill drinks, chips and beans. I know people who eat here a lot and the flavor and spice of the food were missing for me. My husband had beef chimcagna and it was meat rolled in  burrito, nothing else. I had shrimp fajatis and they were just ok. I have had better. I don't like any other Lindo places and.I tried this one cause it's the original one and still a no go for me. With so many places to eat in Vegas this one needs work."}
{"text":"It is expensive for the type of food that you get here but still yummy. They actually have a pretty good breakfast. The wait to egg works was crazy long so we hopped across the street and were pleasantly surprised since we only had come for dinner in the past."}
{"text":"Loved the bean dip as a starter. Chips were nice and thick. The service was outstanding. Especially the one in charge of filling the drinks and chips. He rocked! I had the steak fajitas, the tortillas were large, authentic, and durable. Others at the table had flautas, chimichangas, and the shrimp diabola. All were happy with the meals.  Great Mexican spot."}
{"text":"As good as it gets when it comes to a \"hole in the wall\" authentic Mexican restaurant. From the fideo soup and margaritas to the atmosphere and carne asada. I'm just glad that it's not an over-priced, over-hyped spot on the strip. When you know about this place it's like knowing of a local secret gem that nobody else has found."}
{"text":"No better Mexican restaurant anywhere!  Dessert Inn location. Authentic 100%! Using finest quality ingredients, authentic recipes, perfect seasoning, they have never disappointed. This restaurant is always packed and amazingly the service is always excellent.  Been here dozens of times on many occasions and we've never had a single bad experience.  It's a very busy place seating many many guests in three beautifully classically appointed Mexican decor.  Good vibes, fantastic food, happy people in a very happy place.  We'd rate it 10 out of 10 if we could.   No patio, no pets."}
{"text":"We're been patronizing this establishment for a few decades.  We have never, not even once had a bad meal here. Service is the best service anywhere ever!  Quality, quantity, quality!  It's all about fresh and abundant portions.  An array of flavourful options of rare to find authentic Mexican restaurant.  Huge facility partitioned into 3 festive fun dinning halls, large bar, and even though we arrived early tonight to get a great table for 8, the place was packed....it always is!  It's a sure bet to eat here when you've hunger pangs for rich delicious succulent Mexican fish, meats, chicken, shrimp, and vegetarian options too! We've brought hundreds of guests here over the years, from clients to family/friends.  Nobody ever complained about anything........ ever! This is the very very best!  Vegas can be proud of this icon."}
{"text":"Not even close to authentic Mexican but the margaritas are wonderful.  And the view can't be beat.  Was pleasantly surprised with beef machaca and eggs for breakfast last Saturday.  Again, not the most authentic but certainly decent enough.  Not good as compared to what I'm used to in So Cal, but pleasant.  Service generally on the slow side for with an almost empty restaurant I was taken care of quite well."}
{"text":"It was a warm and dry 9pm Tuesday. My cohort and myself needed sustenance. He was expecting fast food fare, I was desiring carnitas. I told him, head forth towards home, we're going to Lindo. To his surprise regardless of the fact he has lived down the street from here since, oh say, the late 90s my poor friend has failed to enjoy in the delicacies of Lindo's fine Mexican fare. We're greeted promptly as we enter, the staff's garb clean cheerful, somewhat traditional with clearly written name tags of Victor, Carla, Jose, and so much more. The smell of the spot is enticing, the decor borderline cheesy yet, for some reason it is not cheesy at all. Not unauthentic like Macayos, it is actually just right. The manager you can see pacing around making sure everything is running fine. The servers touching base on tables making sure the customers including the viciously drunk lady across from our table swimming in her margarita while her date just nods hoping she doesn't order an item from each section of the menu. Let me put it this way., the atmosphere is great. Casual yet not too informal. I can take a date here and she would be happy. The place works period.   Food, oh the food. The delicious tasty food. Forget what my buddy chap had, it's not his review. I can say this, the man was shocked he had not enjoyed Lindo before. His food, his beer, his shot of 1942, his astonishment of the quality that went into everything. Hell we even had some tomatillo soup and this man did not bitch one bit. He's a beer snob, a steak snoot, a foodie of self hallucinating proportions when he's hopped up on port.   I had the Carnitas in Coca-Cola sauce. Delicious, if only Chinese food could do sauces like this without the MSG. Seriously, tender succulent piece of pork in this delightful sauce gave me the sweet and the meaty in one plate. Fresh guac on the side, beans that were beany, rice that was ricy. I had no complaints save for the fact I couldn't finish it. Granted we had two bowls of chips and two refills of salsa, but I digress.   Food is on point, service is on point, the scene was set, and my stomach was satisfied. Would I recommend this to my friends family and even strangers? You bet your ass I will.   Hell I even skipped some details so my fingers don't go numb."}
{"text":"Every time I come to town I stop in here to sober up with delicious food. Staff is always pleasant and the food is great!! Must come."}
{"text":"My friends wants to get a drink after they obtained new tattoos near by.  We sat at the bar.  The bartender was nice and helpful.  Had the fiesta colada.  So yummy!  The nachos were good, but way too much cheese."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place. I haven't been back in forever, as i now live on the opposite side of town. Menu is huge,  offering something for even the pickiest of eaters. Food is amazing, table-side guac is to die for,  service has always been top-notch. Don't even get me started on the margaritas.. they're delicious and made perfectly. I've celebrated mine and my daughter's birthday here,  and they always make it fun! Side note,  the view is AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"I have to say, this is probably my favorite restaurant ever. The service is always amazing, the food is sooooo good, and me and my family have been coming here for at least 10 years and we always pick this as our birthday dinner. When its your birthday they give you a free tequila shot and churros. I have only gotten the same thing every time I've been there which is gulf shrimp, wrapped in bacon and deep fried, holy heaven... And the sauce they give you to dip the shrimp is addictive, i dip everything in it, i would dip my shoe in there and it would be delicious. They give you this soup in the beginning with tiny noodles, and a chicken/tomato broth that's so awesome. And also the chips, salsa and bean dip they start you off with is so good, be careful or you'll get filled up before your food comes. All in all you never have to wait for your drink to be filled, great service and awesome food. Maybe a little expensive but worth it!"}
{"text":"We were referred here by our hotel.   It was  clearly a local spot with fabulous hospitality,  service and food.   You couldn't go wrong with a visit for lunch.   It wss quite busy for a weekday lunch but we were seated right away.  I don't know how it would be for dinner."}
{"text":"This is the best place to go! The food is bomb and the views are off the charts. Definitely come here whenever I get a chance!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have a live musician/singer, which is a really nice touch :) The service is very fast and friendly. My absolutely favorite dish here is the carnitas a la coca cola. The meat is really tender and super flavorful. I also like their flautas. And their complimentary fideo soup is so delicious! Almost every time we come here, we're seated right away. Except for one time when we went on a Sat around 7:30 pm, it was super packed and we had to wait about 40 min to get a table. So you should make a reservation if you're going there on a Sat. It gets pretty loud when they're busy (I hate loud restaurants). The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because sometimes they get super busy & because their complimentary corn chips & salsa could be better. The chips are a little on the thick side, not light and crispy. And their salsa seems more like hot sauce than salsa (not tomato-y enough). But their flour chip that comes as a garnish in your entree is delicious. The food portions are a good amount for the price. And I like how they have lollipops instead of boring mints. I keep coming back here again and again."}
{"text":"Lindo Michoacan= YUMMY This place is never a disappointment! The staff is always amazing and cater to your every need, the food is always superb, and the drinks are fantastic. I have tried many dishes here, but my absolute favorite are the grilled fish tacos. The guacamole is freshly made at your table so you can pretty much control how you want it to taste. The chorizo fundido or queso fundido is the best I've had (a lot of places will mix in fake tasting cheese, blegh). Cadillac margaritas are the way to go and definitely do their job of getting you tipsy. This is a perfect way to kick off your birthday celebrations. The views are amazing and so are the desserts. I also love their fideo soup (although I think I am the only one I know who eats it lol). I have been giving this place business for years now and I will continue to do so :)"}
{"text":"Came to Las Vegas and returned to this restaurant and disappointed with their taco salad in the shell which was now just a plain chicken salad.  Tried to explain this was not what I wanted and they did not care from the waiter to the supervisor.  I clearly let them know I was not satisfied with my choice and their change in the menu and I left it there uneaten.  They didn't care and We still had to pay for it."}
{"text":"This is my fouth time in this location and the crew here are always friendly and service is outstanding.  of all the dishes we had there is only one i didnt like and this was lengua a la tequila .. if you want good service witha little ethnic taste lindo michoacan is the place to visit.."}
{"text":"I live in the bay area and a friend of mine who's from Vegas recommended this place to me for our trip here this time around...its one of the most delicious Mexican food restaurants I've ever been to. Authentic food (really!! My hubby is part Mexican and he ordered the chile verde and devoured it), not to mention the decor makes you feel like you're really in Mexico! Tortillas are made in-house, guacamole is made table side, and the complimentary chips and salsa (and bean dip) is right up my alley. There was also a one man band playing that set the mood and the soup before dinner was tasty. great experience with friendly staff and our food came out so quickly! Wish we had one in Cali!"}
{"text":"Wowwww, I thought I was spoiled with Mexican goodness living in the Bay Area. Holy crap, this place exceeded my expectations by a huge amount. Everything, and I mean everything was on point. Some of THE BEST service I had EVER seen in my life and I've done a lot of eating out. Water glass 3/4 full? Get ready for a refill within seconds? Chips almost completely killed? Refill is brought right to your table before you can get the last chip. The staff is very welcoming and friendly as well. Hostesses all greet you with bright smiles and the waiters are very polite. Food was near perfection as well, no complaints at all there. My brother's burrito was literally the size of a football!!! Only thing I have to warn people about, DO NOT plan to eat here if you plan on going out that night. You will be so incredinly full that you will be embarrased to show your 6 pack if you have one. I sure as hell know I nearly needed a food coma and went directly to my hotel room and took a 2 hour recovery nap from my lethargicness. Then I got a call at midnight from the friend who said come down to the casino and I sure as hell did. Interesting night!"}
{"text":"I think I'll probably not be back because my mom had got her soup and she found a hair in her bowl. They probably have a big ass pot in the back and still served the soup . Plus didn't even give us a little discount or something for the inconvenience. Server was okay but not on top of it.  I'll def not be back . I'll rather go back to bonito michoacan."}
{"text":"\" Massive Menu, Great Food, Awesome View ! \"\"   My wife and I were invited by some friends of ours to visit the Lindo Michocan Mexican Restaurant in Henderson, Nevada for dinner. What a place!. The Menu is massive. It will take you some time to read through it, and decide what you are going to have for dinner from their gourmet Mexican cuisine. I had one of the best Chili Relleno's and Cheese Enchiladas I have ever had. My wife had the Carnitas, which were also delicious. Our friends both had the Mojarra ( Tilapia ) which was huge, and look fantastic. The view the restaurant has especially at night over looking the entire city of Las Vegas, is Fantastic ! The restaurant hand makes their own fresh tortillas, and has live entertainment playing great Mexican music while you eat. We would difenitely go back to te Lindo Michocan again !    Visited November 2014"}
{"text":"Went for late night happy hour with my work compadres. They offer sopitos, quesdaillas, nachos, cheese stuffed jalape√±os, and tacos for $3-5. Portions are huge! They also offer margaritas and beers for $3-4. With a spectacular view of the Vegas strip and a freshly made margarita for $3.50, you'll be extremely happy with this happy hour. Much better late night Mexican fix than some sketchy take out...  Chips, salsa, and bean dip are complimentary."}
{"text":"The menu is vast! Allow yourself 20 minutes to read through the 6+ pages of options.    The Summerlin location of this Las Vegas favorite is pricier than the rest.  All of the entrees are approx. $2-3 more than sister properties.  That said, the portions are more than fair.  Your dinner is likely to provide leftovers for an additional meal.  All the meals come with a tasty little cup of tomato fideo soup.  I would go just for this hot deelish little soup cup.  A house margarita is $10 - that's a bit steep for off strip.  On our most recent visit, we started with fresh guacamole.  It is fresh; and mixed up right at your table.  I dined on the coca cola carnitas.  The tender chunks of pork are coated in a rich, dark, flavorful sauce.  They will curb your craving for delicious pork!  My husband was quite pleased with his fish tacos, and my sister in law was ga-ga for her steak tampiquena and cheese enchilada.  Smiles all around.    Dinner was $110 for 4 with 1 marg, 1 beer, 1 tea, 1 guac, and 4 entrees.  Like I mentioned, a bit high on price but high on portion and flavor as well!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food in town!! The service is amazing the food is fresh, everyone is so friendly, Hugo es el mejor!! Andrea at the front is a sweetheart!! See you again soon!  Y muchas gracias por todo siempre!  Much love from LA"}
{"text":"The staff is so nice !! I came there after a long day of work super annoyed and hungry but they put a smile on my face !!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why anyone would give this place less than 5 stars! We are from out of town and a coworker recommended this restaurant and location.   Let's just say that friends make sure that friends eat at Lindo Michoacan.   Aside from an amazing view of the Las Vegas area, the food and service are spectacular.  Everything cooked fresh and to order. The staff is friendly and attentive. I ordered the Tamale (\"Tamal\" in their menu) and Enchilada combo.  My first bite into the Tamale told me what I needed to know about this place. We even ordered a dozen Tamales to take back to our room for the rest of our stay. They have 3 locations but we went to the Henderson location as that is what my friend suggested as we were returning from our Hoover Dam tour. Make the trip to this restaurant. It will be worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm Mexican so when it comes to Mexican food I can be very picky. I've been here more than several times and I have never had a bad experience. The chips, salsa, and bean dip are fresh and delicious for starters. For dinner I've tried the seafood chimichanga, garlic chicken plate, seafood enchiladas, and one of my faces the avocado seviche plate. The margaritas are pretty good too.  Parking is tough around there but the view and food is worth the parking struggle."}
{"text":"This is the biggest Mexican Restaurant I have  been in!  Beautiful Views!  Great Food.  The carnitas was the best my husband ever had!  The service was fast and friendly. They were good about my food allergy.  We went for the 1st time last night.  A Tuesday. The parking lot was full and cars were parked on the street for about 2 blocks in every direction.  We almost left and went somewhere else.  We walked in and were seated--no wait! We will go back!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and it was a great experience! Livier I, not sure if I'm giving last or first name but we sat at the bar and she was a great host. The service was great along with the amazing food!!! I would definitely recommend along with our bartender/server! :)"}
{"text":"We have been there at least 5 times now and I'm a huge fan!!! LOVE the table-side Guacamole, bean dip, chips, and salsa's to start.  We have tried the carne asada taquitos, the enchiladas, the Carne Asada, the beef taco's and chicken chimichanga.  They were all tasty!  The beans and rice are standard.  Love their fideo soup.  Service has always been very good. Prices comparable to the other Mexican restaurants in town."}
{"text":"I'm the trade show coordinator for my company.  It's my job to book accommodations,  flights,  transportation, and find a restaurant to hold our company dinners. We have two major shows and one happens to be in Vegas. I discovered Original Lindo Michoacan on yelp and I read a lot of great reviews. I booked our company dinner her last year in October but before that in July 2015,  I came with my boy friend. I decided I wanted to try it out to give my thumb of approval. Let me just say, they did not disappoint. The service was amazing from hostess to bus boy to the entertainment. They start you off with home made chips and salsa and refried beans! Soooo good! The drinks, especially the Margaritas, are perfect. Especially the organic Margarita. Once you place your order, they bring you a small bowl of fideo. They have a variety of food to choose from including vegetarian. Since July 2015, I've been back here 5 times. Twice with the company and 3 with my boyfriend. Most recently on October 18th. The CEO asked me to book the dinner here again.  I highly recommend the Pollo asado with rajas de chile y crema, served with rice and beans with homemade flour tortillas. This is my favorite dish. The carnitas soaked in coca cola is pretty good too. The birria de chivo is good and I'm picky about birria de chivo. If it smells nasty, I won't eat it but theirs is legit. It doesn't smell nasty and is delicious with cebolla and cilantro. This time around I ordered Pollo asado al mojo de ajo! And it was just as tasty as the other dishes. Real authentic Mexican food. I wish they would open up a location in LA. They have 3 locations in Vegas. If you're in town and want legit Mexican food, I highly recommend this spot! There's a reason why the were voted #1 in Vegas. They do not disappoint."}
{"text":"Let's start off  with the environment. The vibe is set to a very welcoming/vibrant atmosphere since the moment you enter. It's busy every time i go but worth the wait. The food is delicious and you can never go wrong with a carne asada plate. My only issue is the seating. In some seats the padding is so much that you feel squeezed into a booth. Besides that overall it's worth the visit."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Mexican food place when in LV. The service is outstanding first of all, they serve Pepsi but have Coke in the original glass bottles of you ask. When they bring you your chips they come with salsa AND beans. The Sopa de Fideo is a little bit of home when I'm on my business travels. My favorite thing to get here is the Al Pastor taco plate with nice cold Michelada.  I'm not a huge fan of any of their seafood here, but their original take on the classic steak more than makes up for that. Pretty sure this place has been on TV a few times.  Parking kind of sucks during dinner time, thankfully they have a large lot in the back."}
{"text":"I frequent this spot for its cognac chicken(highly recommend), carnitas and gulf shrimp dishes(the crema one is amazing). The food is muy authentico and the atmosphere is great with live music/great service.  Three stars because they have a disgusting salad option/(s?)... opting for something on the light side of fullness, last night I tried the seafood salad: an avocado shell filled with a cold mess of (too much) bland shrimp and avocados on a (mainly iceberg) lettuce blend. If canned shrimp existed, it would  taste like that in last night's salad.   They do have a cobb salad that sounds promising. I have faith in this place(one of few good places to eat in my neck of the woods) and will try it soon enough.  Lately, the guacamole has been too chunky and bland(ask for much lemon and less texture) and I concur with Keith that the complimentary soup here is lame and should disappear."}
{"text":"Had so much fun at this place. The view from the bar is amazing! Nice live entertainment. I'm not into mariachi music....(i know, I know it a Mexican restaurant) but it was nice Spanish music.  I even made some money gaming at the bar.  I would say the best Mexican restaurant in Vegas. Ambiance(view) food, service and live entertainment. I live in Summerlin and make the drive here when I feel like Mexican food"}
{"text":"Been going here for a few years now. The food is always consistent. Flavors are bold and presentation is visually appealing. The menu has a little bit of everything, from quesadillas and burritos to menudo and lengua. They also have a happy hour from 2-5 in the afternoon with 2 for 1 cocktails. Just wish they'd include appetizers as it would probably entice me to go a little more often.  The restaurant itself feels cozy and comfortable (we always sit in the bar area or on the patio). They also typically have some sort of live entertainment. You can't go wrong with most of the appetizers they offer but I really enjoy their plates. And of course the margaritas are delicious. One of the better options around for sit down Mexican food."}
{"text":"Right up the place from the dealership I work at so I am surprised I've never tried this place out before now!  Great service and even better food! What's not to like?  Cheese Enchiladas 4/5  Queso Fundido with Chorizo 5/5  Carne Asada 5/5  Everything was good, made well, and pretty quick. We made it in and out on our hour lunch break with enough time to get back to work."}
{"text":"Went their for dinner last night. The place is really loud, some enjoy that atmosphere as did some of my group. I prefer a place that I am able to carry on a normal conversation. I had received really good reviews though, so I figured I would give it a shot anyways. We ordered the guacamole, it was really bland. I ordered the Chile Colorado, and it tasted like vegetable oil. The view of downtown was the saving grace. If you like the busy atmosphere, then a good place to go. If you want good food and a quiet night out, then i would recommend trying a different place."}
{"text":"I wanted so badly for this place to be amazing unfortunately it fell so short. The parking lot is a mess with not nearly enough parking for the size of the restaurant. We walked in and it was so loud you had to yell to have a conversation. We always sit at the bar so we made our way over there and had perfect timing as a couple was getting up so we were able to sit down right away. We were there on a Sunday night and they had 4 bartenders and the place was packed, but the service was just flat out some of the worst I've ever come across. Every bartender had a scowl the whole time we were there. We ordered margaritas and for the second round we asked for it to be Cadillac and the bartender glared us even more and rolled her eyes. This is on the drink menu we weren't asking you do anything ridiculously hard or outside of your job description we were simply asking for you to add a floater to the top of the margarita. We order the carne Asada tacos which were very good and then the carnitas Coca Cola which was bar far one of the most unbalanced dishes I've ever had. And most of the pieces were super fatty and gross. Then all four bartenders were standing around talking to each other in a group while we the couples on both sides of us all had empty drinks and trying to get another round. The service was so terrible especially for the amount of staff they did have. The only reason I give this place 2 stars was for those tacos and the view other than that I would give this place 0 stars for the service, parking and the carnitas."}
{"text":"Try to be seated by the window, because of the view. The view you get of Las Vegas is spectacular.  Service was excellent. Starting with host to the waiters everyone was very nice and friendly.  I had the chicken enchiladas was a little disappointed because the chicken didn't have much of a taste. I love some spiciness to my good.  I have to say the guacamole was excellent the waiter made it in front of us. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Had just finished playing golf at LV National and yelped for some good Latin cuisine. BOOM...Get out the way, get out the way Hommes...Lino Michoacan 1.2 miles away. (yes, I know it's not Hommes)...anyway so I've been eyeing LM for over 6 years peeping the one in Summerlin when I lived out there but never went because I thought it a chain and you know, I'm a big supporter of Mom & Pops local but I went and was blown away.    Door opening, smiles all around, everyone took ownership, everyone cared; it was refreshing.  Bathroom check...clean!  Boom. Smelled good, looked good. First thing I check when I go to a new spot is the lavatory.  If they care there, more than likely the Cocina is limpiola...Clean.    They have chicken Mole!!!  I've not had good chicken mole since I was in Berkeley.  When I have breakfast at a new place, I always have the corn beef hash. If it's legit, then I come back.  If it smells and tastes canned, well... you know.  If I'm having lunch or dinner at a spot and they have Fish and Chips, I check that.  If the fish is frozen and water comes out when you bite, well again, you know the deal.  Can't do it and won't go back. Don't skimp on the shrimp. I do a Mole check for the legitimacy of a Mexican restaurant.  Our drinks arrived quickly and like a ballet, the chips, red AND green salsa and a small bowl of REFRIED BEANS arrived shortly after with the freshly made in the hizzy chips. Thick chips, lightly salted, crunchy good.  The salsa were fresh, made in house I'm certain, visualizing  un Abuela supervising the making of the sauces and every aspect of the making and delivery.  The entree arrived.  Chicken Mole... mmm, mmm, mmmm.  Wish I took a pic...did I???  Anyway, I digress.  The sauce was smooth, glossy brown with that reddish hint of under tone.  The mouth was delicate and flavorful, the nose was aromatic and filled your olfactory senses with pleasure.  The chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked, succulent pieces of tender chicken breasts.  This was legit.  Rice and beans on the side, both perfectly prepared.  I'm a big guy and I could have taken the doggy bag but I finished.  My golf buddy didn't grind and took the bag.  Whatever.   If you go, you will be happy and perhaps surprised as I and my ATM was happy too."}
{"text":"What a relief to have found this place ion a late night shortly after arriving Sin City! The guacamole (that they actually make AT your table! :) is a MUST! The food was great & so was the service. My only complaint is the volume of the music-- please take it down a notch!"}
{"text":"I frequent the Flamingo and 215 location of Lindo's but this was my first time at the Henderson location.  My friend lives in Salt Lake where good Mexican food is non-existent, so when she asked for some Mexican cuisine, I took her here.  The guacamole was unbelievably good!  It's prepared tableside and it had a nice amount of cilantro and jalapenos.  I had so much guac that I could not even touch the amazing chicken dish our server suggested I get.  It went home with my friend.  Service was great and the view is out of this world! You can see across all of Las Vegas.  Portions are huge.  You've been warned!"}
{"text":"The food, portions, and service are all amazing. This is hands down the best and most authentic Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"If you'd like to get a glimpse of the afterlife. Order the Guacamole and chips. Heaven sent us a miracle mixed by a waiter in a Mexican bow tie."}
{"text":"Best Guacamole we ever had. Prepared at the table. Very good food. Very friendly service,great atmosphere. Will visit definitely again when being in Vegas next time."}
{"text":"I don't usually dig Mexican food so I wasn't too thrilled when my husband suggested we give this place a try. He was suckered in by the large glass windows and the restaurant's location, perched high atop a mountain overlooking the Vegas valley. (The view did NOT disappoint, by the way! It's a great place to take out of town visitors to impress them with a stunning view).   The restaurant is large and spacious. The hostess was super friendly, and you walk in right by the open kitchen. The menu is large with all sorts of interesting and creative dishes (I got a chicken breast cooked with sweet peppers and topped with cream and it was amazingly tasty). I also asked if I could have veggies instead of rice and beans and they said no problem and were very accommodating! All dinners come with freshly made flour tortillas (sooooo yummy), rice & beans (or a vegetable medly of mushrooms, onions, zucchini and peppers if you ask), and a pretty dang good cup of soup (tomato broth with noodles). Another big plus is that they serve Pepsi products. Nothing's better than a fizzy Diet Pepsi on a hot day!  The complimentary corn chips, salsa and bean dip were nothing to write home about, but we managed to gobble down almost the entire basket. The food really is \"Mexican gourmet\" as advertised. The ingredients tasted fresh and the options inspired. There are also standard items for picky eaters (tacos, quesadillas, fajitas).   The best thing about this place is the service! We had TOP NOTCH service, better service than we have had in some of the fancy places in town! I kid you not. We never had to ask for anything or needed anything. It was amazing. The service here is something that really surprised me but it will keep me going back!"}
{"text":"One of the three Lindo Michoacan locations in Las Vegas, this one can definitely hold its own. While not quite as good as its sister locations, this is the closest one to me so I eat here often. The signature stellar Lindo service is here (really, how do they always manage to give 5 star service no matter the time of day) and the food is delicious.   I love the queso here, it's basically a big plate of REAL melty cheese baked with charred poblano peppers and served with Lindo's delicious homemade flour tortillas! I love the tortillas here and I frequently eat my weight in them (bye bye low carb diet). The complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip is always a hit too. The food here is just delicious. You can't go wrong with many of the dishes (although sometimes the chicken quality in some of the specialty dishes is a little bit rubbery and \"off\" -- don't know why, but it has happened a couple of times at this location). I've never had an issue with the chicken quality in the chicken fajitas or with any of the seafood or beef dishes. The guacamole is worth getting, and they have yummy Diet Pepsi and fresh brewed iced tea. Again, the focus is on quality and service.   The prices are higher than your average Mexican restaurant but I think it's worth it. This location runs incredible lunch deals and specials during the week, and the kitchen is fast so it's the perfect spot for a quick workday lunch.   The hostesses will automatically try to seat you in the bar section of the restaurant if you are a party of just adults. There's an extra special atmosphere in this area on weeknights when a dude in a sparkly red shirt plays a synthesizer and sings pop songs in broken English. It's pretty rad and it's not too loud, which is nice. If you are looking for a quieter experience, ask to be seated in the other part of the restaurant.   Note that the parking lot here is deceptive and is often overflowing with cars. Even if it appears packed, do not be discouraged and assume there's a wait -- go in anyway. I've never had to wait here even on a very busy Saturday night."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite of all the Lindo locations in town (and this is the original, where it all started)! There's no view and parking is obnoxiously limited, but the service is fast, the employees are friendly, and the food is yummy.   This is where I come when I want to blow my low carb diet. The fresh made flour tortillas are so good that I usually end up eating several baskets -- and it is always worth it! The corn chips and salsa / bean dip are all super tasty too. The menu is large enough so there truly is something for everyone. This location does a big office lunch business because they have a great smaller portion lunch special menu, so expect crowds if you go during the workday.   My go-to favorites here are the queso with peppers as an appetizer (simple yet always amazing), the Pollo Con Rajas Y Crema Estilo Stephania (chicken breast with mild roasted peppers and a yummy cream sauce), and tasty chicken fajitas. A true local Las Vegas gem."}
{"text":"Foods amazing. Staff is awesome. Not a lot to say but the best Mexican food in town. And always go on your birthday cause you'll have the time of your life! I know some of the staff so I never have a bad experience."}
{"text":"The food and service were spot on.  The only thing I didn't enjoy was the salsa! I would suggest making a reservation or you will wait!"}
{"text":"This place will not leave you disappointed.  First walking in, I thought I was going to be in trouble as the bar part was unusually hot. Didn't know if that was part of the Mexican charm of the place but the table seating was much cooler. You have to be careful with the chips and salsa they give you, as you will definitely eat more than you should. They are delicious.  The Cadillac margaritas were magical. It wasn't so pounded with sugar that it would make you diabetic, but it wasn't deprived of sugar to make you think you were just drinking straight tequila. It was the perfect blend and I drank a few of them.   There are a lot of interesting dishes to try out as it appears the owner is really into putting a twist on normal Mexican food. I ordered a bone-in rib eye that had a coca-cola sauce. This was by far the most tender rib-eye I've ever had. The coca-cola sauce added a subtle flavor to the rib eye and it did a magnificent job tenderizing the steak. It's something you should really try out.   The other nice thing they had there was entertainment. We had just missed the mariachi band, but we did get there for a guy singing karaoke. He was pretty decent and it added a nice touch to the meal. The other great thing is that, if it is your birthday (or close enough), if you tell the server, they will come out, put a sombrero on you and sing to you. The song is finished with the birthday person taking a shot of tequila and getting a birthday churro. Honestly, the churro was probably just for decoration as it was the hardest grossest churro I've ever had, but it's the thought that counts.   Overall, I really enjoyed the place. I didn't feel like it was hokey, it felt pretty authentic with the decorations and with the faucets in the bathroom being like a water pump. The food is a bit more expensive than I would normally pay for Mexican food, but since it was really delicious with the great atmosphere, it was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Came here because I had some friends raving about how great this place was. Honestly I was slightly disappointed from the hype. I guess my expectations were set pretty high because of other people's recommendations. I heard their customer service was top notch and was one of a kind. Unfortunately tonight proved otherwise. It seemed like they were just going through the motions and not being sincere about it. Our server didn't introduce himself like he did with the table right next to us.   I came with a group of people so I had plenty to taste. All I can say is that the food was okay, nothing to write home to.   However on a brighter note their service was very prompt. Food came out at a good pace and they also give you chips and salsa to munch on while waiting for the entr√©es. Drinks were constantly being refilled so that was nice."}
{"text":"If you order takeout, check the bag to make sure everything is there. I ordered a combo comprising 1 chili relleno and 1 cheese enchilada. They left out the relleno so that was $13.24 for 1 salty cheese enchilada and the sides (chips, salsa, soup, rice, beans). I called back, not to demand anything but just to inform them there had been a mistake. I was told ok and can you please hold. So I held. And waited. And hung up after 10 minutes. Check your takeout bag."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but it was a tad bit burned and the serious was simply \"alright.\" I've been to the one on dessert inn and pecos and that one is so much more constant with their service and quality of their food."}
{"text":"Being Mexican I'm always looking for good, close to authentic Mexican food.  Took mi madre to Lindo yesterday for D√≠a de las Madres. Place was absolutely packed!!! As we arrived we saw a pretty big line but no big deal, we knew this was a possibility. Hostess( don't remember her name, she's blonde ) asked if we had a reservation, I said \"no, sorry girl\" she rolled her eyes and said \"of course\" which I thought was a bit rude. I get it though, I work in the industry so sometimes we may come off rude unintentionally because we're busy. Our server was fantastic, food was excellent, vibe was great! Loved the mariachi! Oh and the delicious churros for dessert. All staff from manager, bussers, food runners and hostesses were on their total redbull and roller skates game! Good job y'all! Will be back for cocktails and a sick view soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's on top of a hill & has one of the most beautiful views of  Las Vegas. This place is huge & has tables outside their patio to enjoy the weather, food, drinks and view! Great drinks & delicious food. Service is good & atmosphere is alive!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy low quality food full of GMO, this is your restaurant.  To be fair, we dined there several times over the last few years out of desperation.  Good Mexican food is lacking in Henderson, NV.   The chips taste like they contain a sawdust filler as a binding ingredient.    Until this restaurant we have never experienced \"dry\" pico de gallo.  No lime or lemon!  Unbelievably they always use tomatoes that are near white as the tasteless onion they use.  Unsatisfying, tasteless and cheap ingredients.  There is a reason for the dim lighting in the restaurant and that is because if you could actually see the artificial color in the cheese, you might not eat the meal (sorry but I can't even call it food).  There is no pride in food at this establishment. It is over rated.  For excellent mexican food with flavor visit Leticia's, La Comida, Denudo or Mi Casa.  Taste the difference for yourself."}
{"text":"I would say 5 stars for the type of restaurant. Not too fancy but still great service and tasty Mexican food at a good price.  The atmosphere is always fun, nice staff and sometimes live music.  We always order fresh guacamole - your server comes to the table and prep it in front of you - another great feature. You can tell him how spicy, how much onions etc.  My favorite thing is the BIG MARGARITAS :) you can't go wrong with them.  The whole fried fish is excellent and also the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Good food, great view of the strip.  Don't ever go to this place on a Friday night!  Its just crazy busy!  Parking sucks.  The inside is extremely noise with the mariachi band playing and all the talking.  The food was excellent... Just the inside atmosphere... It felt like I was at a rock concert."}
{"text":"Worth the drive off the strip to eat here the view is amazing and the food is authentic and awesome"}
{"text":"Good family style Mexican restaurant. Nothing bad on the menu.  If you aren't full after eating here, it's your own fault.  Chips and salsa are served along with refried beans, so be sure to save room for your meal!  This is the sit-down Mexican restaurant I recommend to friends and family in town visiting.   My favorites are the chimichangas and chicken tacos."}
{"text":"Authentic, noisy, great service. A perfect Mexican restaurant, portions are alittle small but there is free chips beans and salsa"}
{"text":"Group,of 4 of us dined here, food d was exceptional. Service was amazingly  efficient and friendly, drink menu options terrific. I travel to MX for 10 days vacation every year, this was as authentic as it gets folks. Can't wait to go,back."}
{"text":"Overall solid food and service. The complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip are good. The table side guacamole is really good. The weekends there is a singer/live band which is a good atmosphere. It's gets busy on the weekends and parking can be a pain so be patient. Slots at the bar but never played."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few of the Lindo Michocan restaurants here in Vegas and haven't been wowed yet. I tend to come here for birthdays of friends who are bit fans, but I don't really come here other wise.   I like how the tortillas are freshly made in house! They are very delicious and have great texture! I also like the view from this particular location! Very romantic and great way to see the city.   The sauces seem a bit flat and not quite what they probably could be. The mole was ok and I do enjoy their carnitas. Their tacos, enchiladas, and tamales aren't the best out there.    I have yet to find a really really good place for Mexican food her in Vegas."}
{"text":"Good food and great service.   Tip: if you like space to eat don't get a Booth, it's a little tight."}
{"text":"On a busy Saturday night, my boyfriend and I were in and out of this restaurant in 38 minutes! - AND we had a window seat with a great view! Our server, Alvaro, and our busser, Rafa, were amazing!!!! We had WONDERFUL service and our food came out within 5-10 minutes! Thank you for the quick and amazing service! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The music was a bit too loud so it interrupted conversation and the wait was a little long. But the customer service was exceptional and fast. They always made sure everything was good at the table and that we had everything we needed. Another note is that the food wasn't amazing but it was okay."}
{"text":"Solo pasando a dar grasias por el excellent service mejor comida y calidad grasias a Luis y Javier por su excelente servicio those guys know how to attend people thank you again y arriba Michoacan - David"}
{"text":"We eat here all the time and absolutely LOVE the food and the margaritas (try the organic margarita) but the service is truly extraordinary! EVERYBODY is so friendly and you can tell they are working hard to make sure all of their customers are happy. We sat at the bar for the first time today and Carmen was our bartender. She was so incredibly friendly and went out of her way to make sure that we were happy with our food and our drinks and actually made our visit a lot of fun today. Unfortunately, you just don't get that kind of service much anymore. We love this place and will be back again and again and again."}
{"text":"Came with my wife as she is from Mexico too, we order chicken enchiladas and it was very good and came out very fast too. For eat some Mexican food this is very good restaurant and they have big menu"}
{"text":"Food was good nothing too special though. I felt like a lot of the food is over priced. Their hot sauce was fire literally! That's probably one of the best highlights. Had the ceviche which was okay and the coca cola carnitas which were good but lacked salt."}
{"text":"How can you not love this place? Awesome chips and salsa, vegan beans for dipping (on request) and TONS of veggie options on the menu in addition to all the meat eater plates. This is definitely a restaurant with something for everyone and we always bring new guests to vegas here."}
{"text":"We went here for our wedding reception last year.  We were craving some menudo so we decided to come to the original Lindo Michoacan, and were not disappointed.   It was super packed, minimal wait and the service was excellent.  The food was even better.  The best part was the live mariachi band they serenaded a newly wed couple.  It was beautiful!!! The prices are higher than most mexican restaurants in town but well worth it.  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, excellent service and the margaritas were great!  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"One star. Entire drink spilled over my back by the waitress. Spent eating my meal wet. Found a hair in the rice. No compensation, they only offered to make a new plate. Not going back. The waiter was very nice about the whole situation however it wasn't enough for me to come back."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best Mexican restaurants in town. The menu has a wide variety of favorites for those used to Tex/Mex food, but they offer so many of their own traditional Mexican family recipes that are delicious chicken, beef, pork and seafood dishes. They have an open kitchen where you can see them not only cooking, but also making fresh flour and corn tortillas. Their oversized chips are served warm with a roasted pepper salsa that is incredible. They offer table side guacamole made to your specifications. Their meals are oversized, so you'll leave with leftovers. Their fresh fruit margaritas are authentic and delicious. They have an amazing birthday tradition involving their nightly performer who serenades with a guitar, plus lots of clapping and cheering by the wait staff, and a complimentary tequila shot. It's a bit pricey but well worth it! And they have the best view in Henderson."}
{"text":"When we want some Mexican grub we think of El Jeffes but sadly it's looks as if they have closed down. There's still a little hope left that maybe they changed their hours and that's why they were closed... Anyhow, we decided to try the new Lindo Michoacan because it is near my house and I have eaten at the Green Valley location and thought it was o.k. so it's time for a second visit. It's nice in the inside-very spacious and of course the view is awsome!!! The whole strip is always in your view. Their chips , salsa and bean dip all needed seasoning. So right away I'm not happy. Not to mention the prices are too high-my chicken dish was $16.95. The kids meals were sad...3 mini quesadilla triangles are all they get on this huge plate coverded in beans and rice that the kids did not want to eat-what a waste!!! My chicken dish consisted of a pounded chicken breast covered in a chili and mayonaise mixture. That was very tasty but when everything else lacks taste it doesn't matter to me that one piece of a dish did have taste. We decided as a family that we didn't care to go back - there are so many other good Mexican restraunts in Las Vegas that I would save money on and not have to put salt in the salsa."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service was fantastic! Order the guacamole, they make it tableside and it is very refreshing! Also recommend trying the horchata, its delicious!"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite Mexican restaurant for 4 years now. The tortillas are the best I've ever had, and the Camarones con Rajas y Crema (shrimp in a cream sauce) is my go-to meal. I dip the tortillas in the shrimp sauce. The service definitely can be slow at times, but if you just ask any server for help they will always take care of you, sometimes you just have to ask!"}
{"text":"Everything I order is wonderful and the staff is always so nice and accommodating.  Great view - lots of TVA for football watching!  Tonight my husband had the carne asada - it was cooked perfectly and tasted fabulous.  I had the #1 - superb and the Cadillac margarita is a must! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome tequila bar and restaurant. It overlooks the whole strip and you can watch the sunset on the mountains. Just a beautiful sight. They have a full bar and delicious tacos. I have a carnitas, steak and chicken taco and some churros. It was all delicious. Best way to end the trip"}
{"text":"I remember coming to Original Lindo Michoacan when I first moved to Las Vegas 12 years ago.  It is one of the first Mexican restaurants I tried here.  I loved it.  The sopa de fideo (noodle soup) to start dinner was such a departure from the standard chips and salsa.  I went back once or twice more after that first visit.  But that was followed by a long absence.  Flash forward many years and I was back.  I had a craving for a sit down experience rather than a taco shop which is just all too common here in good ole Las Vegas.  Yesterday I had the opportunity to stop in.  I was a couple of hours late for the lunch rush and a couple of hours early for the dinner crowd.  Still, it was a rather busy restaurant.  It is popular and yesterday was Sunday so it makes sense.  There were a lot of families dining but I got right in and seated in no time flat.  As I was looking over the menu, I was brought an offering of chips, salsa and bean dip along with the aforementioned sopa de fideo.  I ordered the combo number 6 which came with a chicken taco, a chicken enchilada and a chicken tostada with guacamole.  And of course rice and beans too.  I think my food came out right as I was finishing my soup.  Good timing.  The taco was nothing special.  Basically shredded chicken with lettuce and cheese in a crunchy shell.  About the same as I get for $0.99 on a Wednesday night from Roberto's.  The tostada was good.  It had the same chicken, lettuce and cheese as the taco but with the addition of beans and guacamole.  The enchilada was by far the star of this dinner show.  A large corn tortilla stuffed with tender and well seasoned chicken and topped with red sauce and cheese.  I'm not always a fan of enchiladas.  Especially with red sauce.  But this was rather good.  No meal is complete without a killer dessert.  I ordered a flan on this occassion.  I had tried the flan previously at another Michoacan family of restaurants location and thoroughly enjoyed it so I had high hopes.  The flan last night was OK.  Not stellar though.  It was smooth but a little dense for my liking.  It looked like the kind I used to make as a kid.  The Jell-O brand if that helps any.  The picture showed it with whipped cream.  There was none.  Just a little of the caramel sauce on top.  It was fine and did satisfy that sweet tooth but $5.75 for it?  Eh."}
{"text":"When we come to Vegas, We make it a point to stop by for the Happy Hour and Shrimp Tacos! The chips & Salsa along with the cup of Fideo & Beans is a meal by itself . Service is always good our waiter made some good suggestions and answered any questions regarding meals. Only draw back was the Men's restroom which was messy maybe due to being busy on a Saturday ,"}
{"text":"Flavors were very good and service was spot on. We ordered Chile Colorado and Combination #5. Then we followed up with Sopapillas for dessert. Had to try it just once."}
{"text":"great atmosphere, food is okay, I have had better before. My burrito was pretty big, but my family all commented that their meals were just fair."}
{"text":"Mi lindo Michoacan es muy lindo.  Where else can you get an amazing view of Las Vegas as well as rich and authentic Mexican cuisine? Border Grill probably... But look no further because you have arrived!  There's nothing bad to say about this establishment. I enjoyed the food which consisted of Enchiladas, rice and beans. A bit costly to have in a weekly base - bi-monthly is more feasible.  For a true Mexican experience, I recommend having the mariachi play a couple of traditional Mexican corridos (powerful narratives/ballads). For a truer Mexican experience, I recommend 3+ shots of tequila. For a truer-er Mexican experience, I recommend making friends with a Mexican and have his/her grandma cook for you."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! The service, the food, the staff... it's an all around win! The manager, Leo, is the best! He's been there since I've been a regular (10 years now) and has always been super humble and gracious. The atmosphere is always fun, but not too loud. You HAVE to try the table-side guac. Do it."}
{"text":"Great View, Large Menu (literally).  It really helps to look through the food photos to help make your selection.  Thanks Yelpers!  The lunch menu has many selections for a great price.  I had the steak and shrimp fajita lunch and it was great.  I was happy to see that there is a lot more on this menu than just the fajita/burrito/enchilada and two meats you see at a lot of other Mexican Restaurants.  You could come here everyday for a month and order something different from the day before and not get board.  It's a great experience but as another yelper put it best \"the food is good and the menu is vast, It's not the best Mexican [food] I've ever tasted, but it's good.\" - Kendra F."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Shrimp tacos were fresh and hot. Serving size was plentiful. Our first server was quite slow, despite being seated at the bar top. Our second bartender paid much more attention to us and was a delight. We thoroughly enjoyed our food and will definitely be back the next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was terrible.  No flavor, over priced. Service was worse. Dinners didn't even arrive at the same time. Waiter never came back to check on us or ask for drink refills.  Will never go there again."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. The service is excellent. The staff are all extremely friendly. The bean dip and salsa are delicious. Some of the best chicken tacos I've had. We haven't found anything we don't like yet."}
{"text":"This place has three locations now. This is hands down the best Mexican food in Vegas. Reasonably priced as well. The habanero salsa is my personal favorite."}
{"text":"Sweet baby lord Jesus this place is so good! EVERYTHING, is beyond amazing I've came here couple of times and ordered most of everything and trust me when I say that everything on the menu doesn't let you down. Very authentic and service is amazing!  Our waiter (Gerardo) hope that's correct /: He was outstanding! And patient with us he told us what he liked and what we liked and not only that but he was being really friendly & helpful!  Try to seat w/ him when you go!All of the staff is amazing and that's what keep me coming back (other than the delicious food) 5 stars for lindo! PS.  Try the fried ice cream and horchata!"}
{"text":"Lindo's (as we call it) is a very special place. The food is not the best but you can't beat the atmosphere anywhere in Vegas.  It is a must every time we are in town.  The guacamole is the best around and the Mexican bulldogs with mango and blue moon are amazing."}
{"text":"This is a Mexican restaurant with class and style. We were greeted at the door with a smile and hospitality. Although you may order the typical dishes you would see at other Mexican restaurants, our table ordered some of the more unusual items such as Buey Al Cilantro (rib eye with verde sauce) and Carnitas a la Coca-Cola (pork cooked in Coke). The flavors were great. Service was pleasant and prompt. Not impressed with the cramped width between our booth and a nearby table of twenty nor the AC blowing directly on us. Why the 5 stars? For focus on the customer.  We had a $15 cab ride from the LVH to the restaurant but were delightfully surprised to be offered a ride back to our hotel via their own shuttle at the end of the meal (no charge). Good job!"}
{"text":"The original Lindo is awesome. This location is beautiful but I've been there twice. The first time the service was bad  the second time the food was cold. When I spoke to the manager on duty he said he would check into it I won't be giving them a third chance. I will drive across town to the original location."}
{"text":"I am from Southern California where you can get authentic Mexican food pretty much anywhere! Since moving to Vegas, I have had a very hard time finding decent Mexican food.  I read so many positive reviews about this place that I thought I would give them a try.  I don't know what you people consider \"authentic\" Mexican food, but this isn't it.   The decor was very nice, I really loved the inside of the restaurant.  The staff were all very friendly as well.  The salsa was not good at all.  It wasn't spicy enough and was actually kind of bland.  The fideo soup was new to me, I've never seen that before in a restaurant and it was alright.  I ordered a beef taco, beef enchilada and chile relleno plate.  They used the same green sauce on both the beef enchilada and chile relleno.  The sauce tasted like it was from a can.  And unless everyone else has it wrong, I've never heard of green sauce on a beef item.  I do not recommend this place, nor will I eat here again.  It is kind of sad too because as I said,  the decor and service were excellent."}
{"text":"What a great place to hang out on the patio and have a good Mexican meal. The prices were reasonable and the waiters have some good recommendations if you don't know exactly what you are in the mood for."}
{"text":"It was fun to venture out to the original Lindo Michoac√°n. I've been to the other locations, but this one has a unique charm.   The parking lot isn't huge, but it holds enough cars to get by. Inside you are greeted by an abundance of workers. The uniforms they wear add to the authentic ambiance of the location.   You feel pampered here, because there are so many people making sure you are taken care of.   The food... is good. The chips and salsa disappeared off the table fast. But they were quickly replaced with more. We tried a couple different burritos and they were all packed full of flavor. Three grown men and all of us were stuffed walking out. There was no way we could even think about dessert.   It is not as convenient to get to as the other locations, but I think you'll find it worth the drive to check out the Lindo Michoac√°n that started them all."}
{"text":"Best Mexican fish plate I ever had. The \"Filet Relleno\" so complex I don't know how they do it but I'm glad they do!!"}
{"text":"Always on my list when I hit Vegas, the food is really good, along with the service,  Some times the live music is better than the rest but a real bonus..   Funny how may local Mexican looking ( to be PC) eat here, always nice to see it`s just not another tourist trap.  a double Kudos for some really good mexi food and a great atmosphere.."}
{"text":"One of the best views of the Valley, especially at night.   The food it's pretty good, but it's not the best I've ever had.  I had the taco's. As for the margarita's, they are made with sweet and sour and are horrible and weak.  I prefer mine to be made from scratch and at least have some tequila in them.  The ambiance is nice, but it's really loud.   The service is good. Would I recommend this restaurant to friends and family?  No.  There are better Mexican restaurants out there, but if you want a nice view this is the place to come."}
{"text":"In heaven. On vacation here in Vegas and so sad I can't come back to this restaurant every week. The guacamole, salsa, and queso fundido were all amazing. The steak in the fajita burrito was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and my parents' chile relleno was the best I've ever had. If you are looking for good food away from the strip this is it!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. The service & food were fantastic. Definitely a fun place to celebrate a birthday as well!"}
{"text":"Husband and I were craving Mexican food. We wanted to relax and chill on our date night so we came across Lindo. I love the area, especially because it's close to us. I've heard many people rave about this place so we decided to try it!   As soon as we walked in, you can smell the deliciousness of the Mexican food. Hostess greeted us and were very friendly. It was a little loud, but we don't really mind the loudness. The atmosphere was really nice and kid friendly and the hostess sat us at a table with the best view of Vegas. It felt really nice.   It took us a few mins to go over the menu, which has plenty of choices from combos to ala carte. I ended up getting the 2 burrito combo which had shredded beef and tender pork with green sauce, served with Mexican rice, beans and a small portion of salad. Hubby got the 3 enchilada combo with beef, chicken and pork with the same sides. Both for $15 each.   As we were waiting for our food, they brought us home made crispy tasty tortilla chips with with mild or spicy salsa and bean dip which was yummy.   Once our order came to the table, the plate was super hot, we had to wait a bit. The portions were really big, I mean for $15 I'd hope they were big. So I took a bite out of my beef burrito and this is where my 4 starts come in. My beef burrito was really really dry and I'm not sure if it was that day they had over cooked it or that's really how they cook their beef. My pork burrito was very tender and was really tasteful and I loved it. Same thing goes for hubby's chicken and beef enchiladas.   Ordered tres leches cheese cake which was yummy. Other than that. I still yet have to try the rest of the food."}
{"text":"so I got here at 6:30 and it's 8:15 and I still have NO food. if you have a big party don't come here, they ARE NOT prepared!!!! I repeat NOT PREPARED, it's cramped as fuck, the beans are shitty, pls help im hungry."}
{"text":"Love this place. The skinny margarita with agave is delish! Fajitas YUM"}
{"text":"Service was spectacular!!! BUT........This is average Mexican food, nothing special. Even the \"atypical\" dishes aren't that outstanding. The chile rellenos with shrimp is bursting with good-sized shrimp but the peppers aren't cooked enough, too raw, and the sauce lacks flavor. Not worth the $20 price point. The mojo pollo, or Gallo al Mojo de Ajo, has a weird tang to its sauce. Either the wine is cooked too much in there or the garlic is off. Either way, not really impressive and not very mojo. I noticed no Guajillo pepper either. This is thinly sliced, grilled chicken with an average sauce. Typical gummy rice and refried beans on the side. The view is about the only thing worth revisiting at this location. Their prices are a bit high."}
{"text":"I use to come here once a month with my wife for lunch and or dinner. I remember the service was pretty awesome, but the poorest most profound thing I found wrong with this company was that the day we ordered our food, it was on discounted day and I didn't even know about it. We received our food and as I took the first bite, I had something in my teeth that felt odd or weird, as my wife looked at me and said maybe it's cheese, I then began pulling it out of my mouth and it was a long black hair which did not belong to me, because I shave my head and my wife's hair is brown and it was physically impossible to have her hair fall into my food cause she was sitting across from me when the waiter placed our food down.   Once I noticed this, I immediately asked for the manager and both the waiter and manager were shocked and the manager actually had the nerve to ask me if the hair possibly belonged to me and or my wife, I laughed and had to ask are you kidding me my head is shaved and my wife's hair is brown not black, he then said we can remake your food and comp this meal.   I said no to the manager and appreciated his comp, but I had lost my hunger after having that in my meal. I took one bite and had a long black hair in my food. Now other than this it was an alright place, but since then I won't and refuse to return, because not only did I walk out without a comp which I honestly didn't have to have, but the respect of the manager should have been there and he should of said your next meal for myself and my wife should of been comped.   Normally in a situation like this I never complain I don't care about spending the money it was the fact I was asked is the hair mine lol or my wife's when food was just brought out."}
{"text":"Greatest Mexican food we've had in two and a half years. (We came to Vegas from the Dallas Texas area.)The service is outstanding and the menu has a tremendous selection of dishes to choose from. If your looking for a great Mexican meal with a very relaxing environment put this place on your list."}
{"text":"Great restaurant pretty large portions got three very stuffed tacos for about $14. We also ordered the table guacamole where some guy made guacamole right in front of our table! The service was fast also. And the tacos Tasted good."}
{"text":"Do not come! If I could give half a star, I would. While the service and speed is to be admired, the food, beginning with the flavorless salsa, refried beans, and soup that they give everyone leaves something to be desired. Let me preface this by saying that I lived in Houston, Texas, for seven years and I am a foodie who knows great Mexican and Tex-Mex (this is neither). The food here has no flavor. My mother ordered the Red Snapper and sent it back because it was rank!!! We never send back anything. My father's beef and chicken enchiladas tasted like the meat and sauces were prepared the Saturday before (we came on a Wednesday). The fajitas tasted like fajitas that someone who has never eaten fajitas, but ran across a recipe for \"Mexican food\" in a Betty Crocker cookbook and \"tried them out\". Do not spend any money here, it will be like you are simply lighting a pile of money on fire and just watching it burn while you walk away. This restaurant is so not worth it."}
{"text":"Chili verde and the tortillas tasted homemade! Everybody's food looked great not a long wait and the workers were on it never had to wait to get my drink refilled! I'll come here again when im in town."}
{"text":"This place has a fabulous view and we were really looking forward to eating here as the tantalizing smells wafted toward us as we walked in. Unfortunately, the place is TOO LOUD! We left without dining since conversation was difficult."}
{"text":"GREAT SERVICE, GREAT ATMOSPHERE!! Food well very good not amazing but very good. Lacked a bit of spice probably just basic like salt. But great presentation!!  I had appetizers for dinner. Fidello soup. Excellent!! Guacamole needed more lime juice and salt but hey personal preference. Queso Fundido very good but could of used a better quality chorizo. Finally, Sopapillas very VERY messy to eat. Lots and LOTS of lettuce. Again just missed a smidge of something to pep it up. Otherwise very good. Would have given 4.5 starts but service was that good!! LOVE YA JORGE!!  ALWAYS ask for him. He's the best. Also, great team here even the managers get involved. Great Job guys!!"}
{"text":"I had the absolute pleasure of having dinner here tonight. First I have to talk about the view. It is spectacular. The restaurant overlooks the city, and the sunset was absolutely breathtaking.  We sat down, and shortly received chips, salsa, and a bean dip. The bean dip was delicious, and a pleasant little something extra. The salsa was a little spicy for our pallet, but it had good flavor. We ordered the shrimp ceviche to start. (It was recommended by our waiter) All I can tell you folks, is YES. Oh my goodness, yes. If you are looking at it, Order it. You will not be disappointed. It came accompanied with to tostada shells, and fresh fresh avocado. Fantastic first impression.   For my entr√©e I was feeling a little adventures, so I ordered soapa de 7 mares. Actually to be completely honest, a woman at the table next to us raved over it- so naturally I had to try it. (Especially after hearing how tasty it was)  The seafood and vegetables in this soup was so fresh and flavorful its not even funny. Surprisingly, the zucchini was one of my favorite parts of the soup. It soaked up all of the flavors of the seafood, and was simply delectable.   My husband ordered the carnitas burrito. You guys. This burrito was enormous. Like the size of a 2 liter of soda huge. He could only eat half of what was on his plate, and still had a full sized meal to take home. I was lucky to score a taste of the pork, and it was so tender and flavorful. The burrito had a super yummy green sauce drizzled on top that pulled the dish together. He made a good choice with that one. We left super full, and very excited about our fun dining experience. Next time we plan to order the guacamole, it was a huge portion and they made it table side so you know it's nice and fresh. (We saw them make it for the table next to us)   Can't wait to come back, definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Gawwwd... I hate going here. I went today for my Mom's bday but it only reminded me of how this place sucks.   First off, I will give credit to where credit is deserved.  There service, bussers, waiters, and so on are excellent. they are fast, friendly and have lots of character. The live music is excellent too.   Now, for the bad.   The hostess, are TERRIBLE, three of them told me that my wait would have only been 20 minutes. 45 minutes later I was pissed, don't tell me a ballpark number if it isn't even close. I tried to talk to one to see what the issue was and in the middle of explaining the situation, she cuts me off to talk to someone who just walked in threw the door... These hosts don't do Sh**t. I was there almost an hour and I didn't see one of them sit anyone, all they did was write incoming guests names on a piece of paper and that's it.   There food is blehhh... I don't think it has flavor..."}
{"text":"The customer service was beyond excellent, top notch service I have ever received. Food was excellent.  Definitely worth coming back."}
{"text":"This place is okay... Parking lot is small for this restaurant so cars literally have to park on the street sometimes to get parking. We had a reservation so it didn't take long to get seated. I ordered some chicken nachos and they were delicious! And huge! (This was the appetizer) When my main dish finally came, I did not like it. It was a carne asada torta.. Who gets a torta wrong? Well they did.. Was not good...  If I ever go again, I'll just order nachos for me:) This place is expensive btw"}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review.  I honestly Cannot say anything bad about this place from the last few visits.   All times I was fortunate enough to be seated by the windows to see the great view of the strip.  My most recent visit was only about an hour ago and the food as always was delicious.  Our server extremely busy with a large party but did a great job at making sure that we were well taken care of.    Not long of a wait. Excellent customer service Delicious food prices are a little higher than other Mexican restaurants, however I've never had this great of service at any of the others.  Well worth the price.  Overall 5 stars"}
{"text":"One star-ness is for the view.  This is a great spot to hear live Mexican music and socialize....HOWEVER, if you order food or come into contact with most of their staff (minus the management & hostess, they're pleasant) then you'll begin to dislike this place as much as I do. I TRULY attempt to give businesses and people the benefit of doubt, and after my visit today, NOPE, NO MORE!!!!   Horrible!  I was bitter when I paid my tab.  Ugh! Off to meditate to purge this negative feeling."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  Live music that is not over bearing. Friendly staff from start to finish.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Very good. Hands down one of the better higher end Mexican food I've had."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my mother in law's birthday. It was really good this time around- maybe we ordered better dishes. Hmm, Anyway, The four of us had dinner here for $46.00. My husband and I both got the fajita burrito, but I got the chicken and my husband got the beef. It was excellent- the burritos were huge. Mine was just as stated in the menu (chicken, onions, and peppers), my husband made a few changes. The burrito was served with green sauce and cheese on it and guacamole on the side. I didn't finish it, and took the rest home. My mother in law got the chimichanga (hers was huge too). Her husband got the two taco combo. And the birthday sombrero serenade with three halves of a churro and whipped cream. was funny. The tequila shot was also complimentary. The server called it \"sugar and water.\" How funny.   Next time, we're probably going to order the same thing."}
{"text":"I needed to take some mid-western family members out to eat and they requested Mexican. I instantly researched places that would meet the following criteria: not a chain (like Chili's or something), sit-down place (not a taco shop), large portions, at least some authenticity.   This place left me pleasantly surprised and was just what I had in mind for my visiting family. The place is huge, so we were able to be seated right away at a large table. There was a man with a keyboard singing the whole time, which was a nice touch although it prevented us from doing a lot of talking as one of my family members is a little hearing impaired.   They brought out the standard chips and salsa but also had some tasty bean dip. Pretty good but the only problem that occurred is when my water was being refilled, the waiter spilled on the chip basket. He took it away and never replaced it. Bummer.    I ordered beef flautas with flour instead of corn. Pretty standard flautas and when I tried my boyfriend's dish, I was upset that I didn't branch out and try something different on the menu. He ordered the coca-cola steak where the coca-cola sauce served to soften the meat while lending a sweet sauce. It was interesting, but in a good way. My dad said the taco he had as part of his combo plate was one of the best tacos he has ever had in his life.   Of course, since we went about a week away from my birthday, my parents told the waiter that it was my birthday. So I had to endure a birthday song sung by several of the staff and then a surprise tequila shot! It also came with a slightly stale churro. But that is just me complaining because the only churro I like is a fresh and hot one.   My family members loved the place and they enjoyed all of the other extra curriculars that came with it, like the singer, the birthday celebrations, and the decor."}
{"text":"We just moved to Las Vegas and went to this restaurant based upon reviews from some of our neighbors. We LOVED IT. Our other favorite mexican restaurant is Super Mex, but this restaurant will become one of our favorites, for sure. Starting with the soup, chips, salsa and beans-what a great idea. We will be back many times in the future. Try this place and you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"The food is good, great ambiance, and views of the city. Fun place to feel social and enjoy a meal!"}
{"text":"The best seats in the house are behind the main bar, down a couple of steps and hidden when you first walk in. Don't make the mistake of requesting a seat off to the left hand side, ask for one by the main window! I'm making sure to come back here for July 4th to see fireworks!  Chips, salsa and bean dip to start. Order the fresh made guacamole- they make it for you right at the table and it's AMAZING. Ask for all the toppings- they make it a little tiny, tiny bit spicy but it's not even noticeable. If you want no spice, just ask!  The a la carte items in the back are half the price, same full size portions just minus the rice beans and soup. The portions here are so big you won't finish it anyways, no need for all of the extras! The combo plates are a nice mix and if you're feeling like having leftovers for the next two meals, go for it.  Parking is tight so they'll always be people parking up and down Carnegie. They do some pretty fun stuff if it's your birthday so celebrate the Mexican restaurant way! ALCOHOL!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you have to wait because they are extremely busy here. But with that being said they run like a well oiled machine. The service is great. The food is delicious. I had the steak ranchero and it was one of the best steaks I've ever had. We love the bean dip that come with the chips and salsa as well. The food is amazing here but the best part is that it has the most stunning view of the Las Vegas strip from inside the restaurant. This place has become a favorite of ours."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp Las Vegas for the recommendation.   Showed up here after a day of walking and shopping and I have to say Julio, our waiter, is fantastic and made the experience a memorable one by making recommendations for my party; who are a bunch of newbies to Mexican food.   The service was pretty attentive with our drinks being refilled and empty plates being whisked away without us asking or noticing.   I orders the garlic shrimp; which was pretty good, bf ordered something chicken salitas (?); the other two in our party orders a chipotle chicken and carnitas. The carnitas were probably the winner, but not by much.    The menu is a bit confusing, so if you get Julio ask him for help navigating the menu.  Do it.   The table-side guacamole is pretty fresh and tasty too. It is worth the drive off-strip."}
{"text":"Buey al cilantro and camornes abuelito Timo are to die for!!!!!!!!!!! Love the beans and salsa they give you when you first sit down."}
{"text":"The food and service were both excellent, with good portion sizes!  And how fun is it to have fresh guacamole made tableside?  I'm just sorry it took me almost 2 years to make it here from the first time friends suggested it.  I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Consistently rated as one of the top Las Vegas Mexican food restaurants in Las Vegas, Lindo Michoacan offers authentic dishes in a comfortable, inviting and festive atmosphere.  Most nights will find the original location filled with patrons mulling over the hundreds of menu items while listening to an occasional mini mariachi breakout.    Our party of five did not have reservations for a midweek, 7:00 pm visit, but after a short wait, we were accommodated."}
{"text":"This is one of my local favorites and most of the food I've tasted is delicious. With that said, on the weekends, the wait can take up to 1 1/2 hours. The problem is the host staff whereby they will tell you the wait is about 30 minutes. That is not the case. I believe they need to be forthright with their customers so the expectation is not ruined because of the long wait. I think they tell people the less time so people don't leave. This is definitely not a good management policy.  Other than that, we have enjoyed the food and the wait staff each time we have been here."}
{"text":"I read such great reviews on yelp so I had to try but to my surprise I was very disappointed. To start i love Patron so i tried the patron marg. It was very bitter. So i asked to try a Javier marg but he brung me the same Patron marg but extra bitter it was awful! I ordered the steak sopitas they were probably the only thing that was ok. The chicken quesadillas were dry and cheese was cold. My chicken enchiladas tasted like the sauce was burnt and the chicken was dry as well. Last but not least i was excited about my carnitas plate but it had NO FLAVOR and the meat was tough.  My rice was hard like it was left out. I was very dissatisfied. The location is big and had a beautiful view. Customer severice was ok when i said the food wasnt great they pretty much ignored my comment. I wont be going back. Spent 80 dollars on something i could've made at home. The food looked delicious but tasted terrible."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place to enjoy a meal. We started with the steak and chicken nachos and finished by splitting the shrimp fajitas. It was all great. And the service was top notch as well. I would not only recommend this place.  I will be back every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love Lindo Michoac√°n for the atmosphere and location. The restaurant is on a hill and offers an incredible view of the strip, lively atmosphere, and live music on the weekends. They do not accept reservations and the weekends can be very busy so expect to wait to be seated. their food is standard Mexican food but not my favorite in the city"}
{"text":"Run of the mill Mexican restaurant n not special bc it's in Vegas. Very large menu, chips n salsa were very good w cold ass beers but I prolly wldnt return; the food was average to slightly below, I didn't find anythg special here .... Sorry!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious!! However the wait was bad. Family and I arrived around 6 pm and got seated at 7pm. The environment was great everyone was friendly and the music was awesome. I recommend the place just expect to wait"}
{"text":"Having spent a lot of time in the last few years in SoCal and Tijuana, I have been to many-a-Mexican restaurant. But this one takes the cake. It's on the pricey side for what it is, but the food and service are both top-notch.  One caveat: SOMETIMES the service slips. After raving to my dad about how amazing the service was, I took him there, and our waitress only dropped by for our order and the bill, and the wait times were ridiculous. I looked like a fool!"}
{"text":"Amazing view, busser was friendlier than our server.  Food was great, prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants in town. I'm obsessed with the fresh guacamole dip and queso fundido served with fresh homemade corn or flour tortillas. Try out an organic Cadillac margarita too and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food with great flavors and taste.  They even made fresh guacamole front of our eyes,  it was so good. Free chips,salsa and beans before you even order... what excellent service. Me and my Wife ordered tacos, and they was so good.   Really romantic place with gorgeous Vegas Strip view.  I love this place 5 from me fellas"}
{"text":"Food and service are impeccable here....Best Mexican restaurant in Vegas! They never disappoint. Every time I have eaten here it reminds me of my abuelas cooking."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, environment is fun and friendly, and the service is great. Our cups were always full and numerous members of the wait and management staff stopped to make sure everything was to our liking. The chips, salsa, and bean dip were a nice touch while we waited for our food. The food came out quickly and was just as described on the menu. The only reason I didn't mark five stars is because I think the portions were a bit small for the price."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to this restaurant and to be honest I was very happy with it. The times that I went, the service was very good, friendly and to me most importantly fast. I One would MAYBE feel that they were being rushed to eat and go because I did notice they immediately kept taking the dishes away after we finished eating, rushed with bringing the check, etc .. But, thats how I like it .. I like getting my food/check/water/service .. everything prompt so thats why I didnt mind, (coming from an impatient person) while others maybe don't like getting rushed .. But overall, the food was great!! They start you off with unlimited nachos with hot/medium sauces. For drinks, we ordered the frozen Mango and Raspberry Margaritas .. which were good. We shared the Carne Asada knowing that their plates are HUGE and we still were full. For desert we ordered the Flan, which was the only one that was \"eh\" .. I had better! But overall, the place is pretty big, they have a live entertainment with some nice Spanish music and the whole atmosphere and decor was very nice. I'll definetly hit this spot up again if I am craving Mexican."}
{"text":"I'm coming here for the views and atmosphere.  Service is perfect, margaritas not too sweet, views incredible.   My favorite dish is whole fish, fried and I understood that it is hit or miss. Sometimes it great, tender and juicy, sometimes its dry and overcooked. So unless i'm crazy hungry i stay on the safe side with fish ceviche. Ceviche is always done perfectly."}
{"text":"One word to describe my visit? DELICIOUS!!!  Stopped in for lunch with my guy and we enjoyed combination steak and shrimp fajitas and a chicken chimichanga with a jalape√±o margarita.  Salsa and chips were fresh and I liked how they served bean dip with it.   Service was attentive  The only cons is the parking is kind of limited"}
{"text":"Very busy, great selection of tequila. The food was ok, but it wasn't expensive. So overall I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Very tasty Mexican food. The view at the Lindo is amazing! Best place to go for a girls night, date night or special occasion especially if you call ahead for a table near a window for night or even day time views of the Vegas valley!   The menu has many delicious items, the fish tacos, the pollo azado burrito, the spicy pork carnitas(food network) and the table side guacamole.  The Cadillac margarita is delicious!!!! The dessert of the fried ice cream is amazing but when ordering make sure you ask for the flameado! That's the best dessert!"}
{"text":"Chain Mexican restaurant located in the Horizon Ridge area.  The restaurant is spacious but parking is limited and it does get crowded.  Ask to sit by the window and you will be treated to a gorgeous view of the Las Vegas Valley and strip.  The drinks are good but the margaritas are very weak.  The food menu is very large with many selections. I had my usual, the number 20 with an enchilada, chili relleno, and tamale. Delicious as always."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican restaurant in downtown Las Vegas off the strip.  The restaurant has indoor seating, a full bar, and live music.  Chips, salsa, and bean dip are complimentary.  We had the Cadillac margarita to start. It was good but could have been stronger.  The menu is very large. If you are looking to try a few things see the combination menu on the last page. I had the #20 which was a cheese chili relleno, tamale, and green chili chicken enchilada. It came with rice and beans. It was so much food I could only eat half. Very tasty."}
{"text":"This location is our favorite one out of all the Lindos. The one on Horizon Ridge has a very pretty view and nice ambiance but this one on Desert Inn simply has the best tasting food and drinks. Their preparadas are so bomb!"}
{"text":"Finally was able to check this place out. Overall it was a great experience.  My only complaint was the service."}
{"text":"We asked the waiter what their specialty was and he recommended carnitas, so we ordered 3 different carnitas dishes, and we were so disappointed. They were more like pork stew than carnitas we are used to at other Mexican restaurants. The Coca Cola one was really a pulled pork BBQ. Not to mention there was a lot of fat in all 3 dishes. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Just tried this yesterday, even thou I had been to the one in Henderson before you can't compare... atmosphere is ok, I liked the mariates but food & drinks had no flavor, as a typical mexican restaurant the salsa & food was not what I expected at all... the one in Henderson has better food, great drinks and an amazing view!!"}
{"text":"Today was the 2nd time I went to this restaurant. I suggested it to my friend as a meeting place since she wasn't familiar with Las Vegas. Because it was lunch, my friend, her husband and she all ordered a taco salad. My husband had the Chili Colorado. The salads were very bland and the lettuce was still in such large pieces, we couldn't find the bottom! My husband said the same about the chili, that it was bland. The server was very gracious as we hadn't seen each other for so long we kept forgetting to look at menu! We won't go back unfortunately as the first time wasn't that good either."}
{"text":"Yum! Food is fantastic! View looking at the strip is beautiful. Guacamole is fresh and flavorful. If you're in Vegas, make the effort to find this place it's well worth the money. The only thing I didn't like was the salsa that comes with your chips. It's on the bitter side."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to eating here while in Vegas as it had good reviews and we love michoacan style food. This was way different. I didn't eat my food and my husband was disappointed too. I ordered carnitas a la coca cola and it was like BBQ pulled pork to me. Hubby had chile Colorado and didn't like the chile they had on it. We were bummed thought we found a gem in Vegas but turned out not to be out style"}
{"text":"went for lunch and everything was great. i usually dont eat mexican food but their carne asada was awesome. the view of the strip is also something good looking at. our server miguel was also awesome."}
{"text":"Made reservations for a wedding reception a month and a half ago for a party of 40 at 9pm.  We arrived at 8:15pm and have been waiting to get seated!  The tables are not ready &  ow they are saying until 9:30pm!  This is ridiculous!  Never again will I come here and to top it off, the food is pricy & not even that great!"}
{"text":"We went here on a busy a Friday night. We did have a reservation. We were seated shortly after arriving. Even though they were busy the service was impeccable. At the table next to us a customer was being a jerk and the wait staff was still super friendly and handled the situation in a class act textbook style. It was our child's birthday. The Mariachi band played at our table had him wear a giant sombrero , put a candle in the flan, and gave us a complimentary birthday shot of tequila. We are going back again this Friday for another birthday celebration. First class , class act place. Avg price 15-20 pp."}
{"text":"Good but not great. BUT its a solid place if your wanting Mexican food with variety! They charge extra for extra salsa and chips.  I also received mediocre service. I had to ask the waiter 3x time to refill my water."}
{"text":"The best authentic Mexican food. Amazing service and I love that they give you chips, salsa and beans and then they still bring you an authentic Mexican \"sopa\" (soup). My best experience at any Mexican restaurant. This place is one of my must stops whenever I'm in town. Thank you! ..... The flan, ceviche and fajitas are amazing. Every time we are in town and we stop by we remember why this is our favorite Mexican restaurant anywhere. This is by far the best customer service and best tasting Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Is it my imagination or has something changed lately?  A new paint job, but no more complimentary fideo soup.  Friendly staff but they forgot our tableside guac and my corn tortillas, the rice wasn't as good as before, and the place wasn't that busy."}
{"text":"Always find ourselves coming in for their lunch specials. Wide range of dishes and proteins. Love the shredded beef salad. It comes with it seems a cup of marvelous beef in their taco shell with a sprinkling of lettuce and small splotch of guac.   Seems popular.  The chicken soup had also about a cup of chunks of white chix. Big pieces of carrots, squash and a corn cob piece. Comes with 2 tortillas ( corn or flour).  My 2 main draws are the Cadillac Margarita on the rocks and their chips, salsa and refried beans. Salsa is spiced with wonderful heat and flavor, for me.  The view and easy parking are plusses, too. I like the servers outfits, too. A comfortable place."}
{"text":"One extension of my family loves this place. Every time there's a Birthday here we are again. I suppose it's a fun ambiance, but the food a couple of us had tonight was not that great. The 3 stars is because the view and the ambiance help. They do a nice job with the b-day celebration too. The dinner I ordered was 2 stars at best. The chicken was extremely dry and lacking sauce. Adding the sauce helped, but I would not recommend them if you want a quality meal. For a celebration is slightly better than average."}
{"text":"Well, finally came back here yesterday.  Never as good as the first time!  Beans were bland, chips not tasty, tacos and enchilada were just ok, I did like that they make the guacamole right in front of you and you get to pick the ingrediants. that was fun!"}
{"text":"This is my go to Mexican spot. The view is amazing!!!! And so is their freshly made guac. 4 stars because I feel like the food isn't consistent. For some reason it's always on point when their busy! The service and quality of food is better when their busiest.. but love the vibes and everything!!!! My favorite dishes are the shrimp tacos and el pastor tacos"}
{"text":"The reviews are so-so but we finally decided to try this place out and were not disappointed. The service was AMAZING. My husband and I both had a margarita and they packed a tasty punch. The bean and salsa dips were good. I feel like the entree prices are a bit higher (couple of bucks) than the food warrants but that won't stop us from dinning here again. Solid 4 rating."}
{"text":"Every time we visit family in Henderson we make sure to stop by and have some delicious food at Lindo's. They are always so friendly and give my daughter a little bowl of noodle soup. The wait staff is friendly and helpful. The food is delicious and authentic. And you will never have to wait for a refill on your drink because a waiter will always be right there to insure your cup is always full. You are missing out if you don't stop in for some yummy authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"The service is great, guacamole was good, tried a mango margarita which is also good.  I had a wet carnitas burrito which wasn't amazing but not bad, I'd come back if friends wanted to."}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican food in the area! I recently moved to Henderson and have been looking for a great Mexican place. I absolutely LOVED this place! Awesome super loud and fun atmosphere, incredible view of the entire area and the strip, delicious salsa, and the menu options are endless! HUUUUGEEEE menu, I was so happy to see they had Enchiladas Sueizas! My favorite. I got it, and the grilled chicken in it is great. They also gave us free Modelo's just for taking a picture! Can't wait to go back. The whole experience was awesome, such a fun environment! Good times!!"}
{"text":"Wow! I frequent the Lindo Michoacan in Henderson that I live right by, but I stopped at this location for lunch while I was in the area. Let me start by saying that being from the Bay Area in California, I am a hard judge of authentic Mexican food, and I rarely ever find restaurants out of California that live up to my expectations. This location on Desert Inn of Lindo exceeded my expectations by far! First off, the service was amazing. Got sat right away, ambience was great and reminded me of my favorite Mexican restaurant in California that went out of business. Their chips and salsa are to die for--I mean seriously, like the best salsa I have ever had. They bring bean dip too. The lunch specials are amazing as well. This visit, I ordered the Chile Verde lunch special for only like $9, and my iced tea was included in this price (score!), and it was seriously the BEST Chile Verde I have ever had. Normally, I stray away from ordering this dish at restaurants I have not been to, but this was just ridiculous. When I typically order it, there's fat on the meat. In this case? Nope, not one bit. So so tender and delicious. Their corn tortillas are incredible too. My server Miguel was awesome! I hope to get him next time I come in. He offered great suggestions and was attentive and very friendly. He even gave me a tip on what to order next time I am in! Thanks Lindo Michoacan, I'm so glad I finally found the best Mexican in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food with a great view. There's a reason that this place has a long wait on weekends.  I must mention that the service here is really good and very attentive. On our most recent visit our waiter checked on us frequently. There was always a staff member in our section making sure that every need and want was met.   The view here is awesome. The restaurant is situated on a hill so certain dining rooms offer a great view of the valley. There is also an outdoor area that offers a nice view.   The food isn't just the standard burritos and enchiladas even though those are awesome as well. The menu is huge and offers many more authentic options as well as the standard Mexican restaurant offerings. The chips and salsa that start each meal don't disappoint. I also enjoy the soup that comes with most of the meals. The food isn't as cheap as most Mexican restaurants, but I figure you're also buying the view.  This is an awesome spot for good Mexican food that makes you want to come back."}
{"text":"I used to love this place two years ago, and always recommend  it to friends and coworkers, but last week when I went it was kinda blah.  Pros- friendly hosts and waiters/waitresses and bus staff.  Huge menu with lots of options to choose from.   The cons are- Why start live music so early?  I came in around 5pm and the hostess sat us right by the speaker, I wanted to have dinner and a nice conversation  with my boyfriend not get a headache, maybe start the musicians a little later on like 8 or 9?  So we moved from the bar side to the main area, even with all the screaming kids it was still quieter than the band side.  That says something right there crying babies sound better than whoever was singing in the other room.  For my food I was really craving a chimichanga, a nice deep fried burrito usually with beans cheese and meat stuffed inside and melted cheese sour cream some sauce on top, yum.  What I got was a soft tortilla with just shredded chicken inside nothing else, and a bare top, nothing, no cheese, sauce, or even guacamole.  I should have went to Cafe Rio, Zabas or Chipotle it would have been cheaper.  The kicker is when we were leaving they had at least 7 different parties of people waiting to sit in the dinning area, no one wanted to sit in the bar area and listen to the live music, that side was dead so many open tables, feel bad for the server who had that dead section."}
{"text":"The entr√©e I got \"lengua con tequila\" was poorly seasoned and had absolutely no sazon. I also got a cadillac margarita that tasted like they just lazily put the alcohol and margarita mix. For $12 bucks a pop I'd expect something better and after I told the mesero about the drink he had them make me a new one which was much better so that's why I'm giving this spot 2 stars. Pretty okay customer service but the food... I've had better cooking from my mom."}
{"text":"Four stars for the food.  I love the view here, as well as the pork verde with green chile sauce (super tender & the sauce is tasty!) and the steak nachos (happy hour). I don't handle spicy foods well, and I found both dishes to be non-spicy! Also, the churros are great. Get the churros! (3.50 for 4) Dinner typically costs more, with dishes starting at $15-17/dish.   With that said, though the food is delicious, service seems subpar. Lunch should have came with a drink, but they never got it for me. Asked for corn tortillas, definitely got flour tortillas."}
{"text":"First impression, they serve gold here for the price of silver. The parking lot practically required a lottery ticket to get a spot.  Thankfully,  I'm lucky.  Our party of 9 was seated right about our reservation time. There was a 2 hour wait for walk ins.  Refreshments, adult and child, were served quickly.   Guacamole, check,  chips, salsa, beans galore. Now, for the meal.   I purchased the beef tamale and beef enchilada. They were both red sauced. I think it was the only tamale on the menu,  no green sauce. Booooo.  It wasn't  amazing, but I did enjoy the beans and rice.   I took leftovers and consumed the next day. I felt like the hulabaloo missed me. I'll go and try something else with green sauce, if they have any. Oh,  I did get some carne asada chunks in my enchilada. That was tastier than the shredded beef that occupied the majority of my meal."}
{"text":"Awesome margaritas!  The food are a little pricey but very good and we like the fast service.  Live music during dinner is great and enjoyable."}
{"text":"I used to eat at the Chinese buffet across the street when I was younger and would see all the cars coming in and wonder, \"why is that place always busy?\" Now I know why. This place is great!   I've eaten here about 3 times. This last visit, I came with a group of 10 at 11pm after working the UNLV game. We chose to eat here because it was open late (until 12:15), has vegetarian options, and alcohol.   While waiting to order, they serve chips with salsa and beans! Our table devoured all of it! It was so good.  After, we were given fideo soup before our meal.   The entrees here are ginormous! I got el burrito bionoco, which is served with either chicken, pork, or beef, and rice, beans, lettuce, sour cream, pico, smothered with enchilada sauce and cheese. I ate 1/4 of it and took the rest home. For $11, it's a steal! Half of my party needed to-go boxes, so you know that's a lot of food.   They also had some kind of karaoke night when we were there. I couldn't see what was going on since it was on the other side of the restaurant, but you can here a crowd of people cheering on others to sing. It's pretty funny to listen to while you eat since the restaurant sounds so lively. The other times I've come, there is a mariachi band that goes to each table and plays a song for them.   This is definitely a place you want to try for good food and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great lunch specials , great margaritas ! Can't wait to return for dinner!"}
{"text":"Service here is amazing. Nothing to complain about there, and so is the environment and the VIEW! OMG. I am finally writing a review after enjoying Lindo more than one occasion, because I really wanted to love their food, and tried at least 3 different things (Camarones a la diabla, pork carnitas, and tacos over my 3 occassions) and sadly, every time their food is bland and meh. My husband can't even finish a plate here which says something, LOL.... if we are going out to eat someplace like this, we will darn sure eat what we pay for. Finally we told the server, who was great and brought the manager over, who discounted our ticket (which we did not ask for, so that was unexpected). But overall, when you dine out and want to pay their prices, you expect much more.   I really hope that they step up their game! Drinks & a view, go here to just enjoy the ambiance but don't expect outstanding food. (sorry Lindo)"}
{"text":"Absolutely my family's favorite restaurant!!! The atmosphere is festive, the view's are stunning day or night, the staff are so friendly and efficient, and the food is outstanding!!  Its our go-to place for all special occasions, especially birthdays.  The mariachi plays the guitar while everyone sings and you get a free churro dessert.  If I have one complaint, is the red salsa is not user friendly.  I like a more mild, tomatoey salsa."}
{"text":"The view and the service was nice, but the food, well...  Not so much.  I have to say, I was really disappointed.  I had the chicken taco.  It was very bland, to say the least.  I \"encountered\" chicken bones, not just once, but twice.  I had a taste of my husband's carne asada, and must say, a taste was about all I could handle.  No flavor and the meat was on the tough side.  I commented that we would have been much better off with the food at Taco Bell. Sorry, but just being totally honest here.  Won't plan on ever coming back here again.  A nice view and service just won' t cut it for us."}
{"text":"Lunch today was just another check mark on the crowded slate of area Mexican restaurants.  There just was nothing outstanding that really one would want to write home about.  It did not appear that any particular server was assigned to a dedicated set of tables.  One waiter took the orders, another brought drinks, yet another brought food and then another brought the bill.  After serving, not one stopped by to question if everything was satisfactory.  The salsa was simply too spicy.  Our menu choices appeared bland and more like commissary fare.  The tacos were on the greasy side.  Parking is a challenge to say the least.  The noise level is very loud and it is difficult to maintain a normal level of conversation.  Their restaurant has plenty of potential, but sadly was not found.  There seemed to be the attitude of maintaining a high turnover, but not emphasis on a quality experience in either food or service.  A return visit is quite doubtful."}
{"text":"This is the newest location of this great family-owned authentic mexican restaurant. It starts with  Outdoor seating, fabulous decor and a great bar. The lunch specials are great 32 to choose from. Personally I always like the Steak Picada or a la Mexicana. I don't know how they do it but I literally cut this steak with a fork. It was the most flavorful & tender steak I've ever had at a mexican diner. The tacos are crispy with shredded beef. By some stroke of magic the taco topping are still cool instead of all hot & wilted like other places. The service here is better than most any place you will ever visit. They take pride in their work and they want to make sure everything is to your liking. The menu is very extensive and reasonably priced and the servers are very good at describing all the dishes for you. If this place was in my neighborhood, I'd work a deal to wash the dishes for a free meal every day. Hats off!!"}
{"text":"The service here is excellent. The restaurant is really nice inside; and depending on where you sit, you can get a great view of the strip. Unfortunately, this is the worst Mexican food I've ever eaten in my life. They bring out chips with salsa and beans at first. The salsa is like watery hot sauce, and the beans have this bizarre \"cafeteria\" taste. I ordered a dish with carne asada and the meat tasted like it was boiled. No flavor at all. I've eaten Mexican food in Mexico, California, Texas, etc, and I've never had anything like this. I don't know what their doing here, but the food just doesn't taste right. I wonder if it's because there's a lot of white people in the neighborhood and they think we like bland food??"}
{"text":"It was delicious Chile verde. Chile Colorado was okay. Fried ice cream was excellent. Huge size!! Service was great! Will come again for margaritas!"}
{"text":"Came to lindo last night, we loved the view as we got there early enough to get window seating. Service was good. View was great. Food was mediocre I had the Chile relleno (they put a tomato like sauce on it) doesn't seem like authentic Mexican food, hubby had tacos and they were ok. I've been to lindo before years ago and now I realize why it's been so long since I've been back. Cost of the not authentic dishes will make me likely not to return"}
{"text":"this is my fave mex rest in vegas!! i was first introduce to this place by sum loser guy who happen to be a total lame all weekend , he was my friends b/f friend, the only thing he did right that weekend was take us all to this restaurant, anyway we went here and the we sat down and the server came immediately with the salsa and bean dip! the bean dip was soo good, the beans tasted like they were just made and smashed ! i got the enchilada and chili relleno, omg!!! the enchilada was meaty, the chicken was juicy and spiced to perfection! the chili relleno was cheesy and gooey and spicy just the way i like it! this is definitely my spot when i come to vegas, and so far eveyone i have brought here enjoy it too!! the service is awesome, food is awesome, the enviroment is awesome! this place is just awesome!!"}
{"text":"I've been here for every birthday , graduation, anniversary etc. you can imagine & not once has this place ever disappointed me! They have great Mexican food & the service is spectacular  they're fresh guac, margaritas &  \"pollo sarandeado\" is to die for! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"We ordered four meals for carry-out. The chicken was over cooked, the tamales were dry, the guac was warm. The salsa was so hot, it felt like it burned my tongue. None of us liked the food and were sorry to have spent $65 here.  Only one person ate all of his food, two of us hardly ate any. All four of us felt bloated, heavy, and gassy afterwards. Disgusting. Some of the worst 'Mexican' food ever."}
{"text":"As my Californian friend said, she only eats Mexican food when she's back in LA.  Well, here in Vegas, which is close to LA, I've discovered that I can find a good authentic Mexican restaurant east of LA.  My recommendation is the shrimp with their special chili pepper sauce and the carne tampiquena.  Their tortillas are freshly made and best of all, the price is right!"}
{"text":"It was beautiful atmosphere with live music, mariachi going table to table.  We tried cactus for the first time, it was weird, but I was exited to tried. Chicken and fajitas - excellent! Sangria 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying the staff is so sweet and very attentive and the views are spectacular. My boyfriend and I came here for happy hour at around 3:45 and ordered each a Cadillac Margarita. Drinks were okay nothing spectacular, but what really set off the vibe was the absurd drunk woman talking so loud and screaming at times next to us. People all around the restaurant seemed to be annoyed by her. It bothered us so much that we just ended up leaving. I wish management would have said something to her to at least kept her voice down because it ruined our first experience here."}
{"text":"YUM YUM! Hello Cadillac Margarita & chips, beans, salsa to start. Decor fun, waiters are friendly & get right to u! BUSY & no wait on a Saturday!! Food is hot & delicious"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food but we tried this place close by. They start you off with fresh tortilla chips and spicy salsa and bean dip. The bean dip is good but I am not crazy about it. I tried a pulled pork and scrambled egg (it seemed kind of like a breakfast concept). It was just ok to me. The horchata was good, and the tortillas come out nice and hot but cool and harden up very fast if you don't eat it right away. They seem to have a huge variety of different Mexican food, I even saw meats like beef tounge."}
{"text":"Very busy place. Our first time there (found reviews online). Long wait (temp 109 D) but chairs available. It was Fathers Day. Service was great and food was above average. I had an \"organic\" margarita that was very good. Service was pretty phenomenal considering the masses of people trying to get in.  I have no idea if they take reservations. Did not check. But...will certainly go back."}
{"text":"Really good food and really good service ! Ordered the enchiladas they were delicious and a large portion ! This place has been featured on tv shoes and in several reviews! It was well worth it! I will return"}
{"text":"I often base the tip on how long my water glass stays empty. They earned a bonus tonight. Good food, above average service, chili Colorado burrito very good. Most everything we have had here is tasty. Ask to sit by the window for a nice view of the strip. So why not five stars...well they are a little pricy but sometimes it's worth it...good food, good service...yeah worth it."}
{"text":"Great customer service! My table was repeatedly asked if we were ok and they had live music! The food was great and very authentic. This is a place I WILL come back to."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food.  Here in Vegas, I have found few places that match the quality of the food and taste.   However, make sure you go to the Original Lindo at Desert Inn.  It  is just better."}
{"text":"First time visiting few nights ago, and was impressed. Bean dip was tasty, but salsa decent. Friend from Texas said \"Bah, better in Texas!\" but his nachos could have fed at least three people, and my steak quesadilla which turned into a shrimp 'dilla somewhere between the waiter and my plate, was outstanding. Would order shrimp 'dilla again, for sure, despite the mix-up. I heard their peach margaritas are notable, too. Will find out next time."}
{"text":"OMG......what an awesome place to eat. My dad is from Morelia, Michoac√°n so of course when I was in the Vegas area, I had to try it. Everyone is super friendly, and very fast service. You get yummy salsa, crisp chips and bean dip before the meal. I loved the margarita! I asked if they would make me a pineapple margarita and they were very accommodating. The fideo soup, yum! I can't wait to eat here again when I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best places for Mexican food in Las Vegas. They have a wonderful view of the strip as the restaurant is a top a hill. They have gaming at the bar which is always a plus. The staff was extremely nice and attentive. Everything I tried on the menu is delicious!"}
{"text":"Their meat portions are very generous. The seasoning was not my favorite, but I have to say it is pretty close to authentic. The one thing that I will definitely go back for is their fresh, table side guacamole! That is the best I have had. It is a must when you go!"}
{"text":"This place used to be one of the best in Las Vegas. For years we are at the original location on DI. Sad to say I'll probably never eat here again due to the taste of ammonia in my steak fajitas. The grease on the chips made me unable to eat them. It's bad when you can't even get full on the chips!"}
{"text":"I have eaten mexican all over the southwest and Mexicao and this was one of the worst.  There were 4 of us and all meals were bad.  The meat was  devoid of any flavor.  It was over cooked and dry.  I have had better rice from a rice a roni box.  The noise was deafening and you could barely carry on a conversation.   As for the compimentary  taco chips, the salsa was watery and tasted like chili powder. So be warned."}
{"text":"God I love Mexican food and it doesn't get any better than Lindo. I have been here so many times and it is a Las Vegas staple. I had my 18th birthday here. I have taken people here just for the specific purpose of introducing them to the incredibly flavorful, spicy salsa. The amazing Coca-Cola Carnitas. The oyster appetizers and the FANTASTIC made right at your table guacamole. Oh - they make it to your specifications!  Add on top of all this a great mixed drink selection. Original margaritas are ALWAYS good. The meats are all marinated and delicious. One of my favorites to get is the pork with green chili sauce. HEAVEN ON YOUR TASTEBUDS.  They are BUSY on Friday and Saturday nights, just so you are aware. The lines can often go out the door. However, even without reservations the staff at Lindo are quickly helping get people in the door and in seats, rather than standing around waiting for food.  The ambiance can be a bit loud if you are here on busy nights because they tend to get large parties and remember - there could be a loud mariachi band playing right next to your table at times.  The last time I came here our waiter was great. Our chips were never not filled. Our drinks were consistently refilled and our meals were delicious. I ate almost ALL of my food, which is crazy, but I was hungry.   If I could eat here all the time, I would, but um... I can't because I don't want to weigh 350 lbs."}
{"text":"The view and the architecture of this place is outstanding. You can see the strip and the whole valley. However, it's very, very loud, the food is average, lots of obnoxious drunks and the customer service, while efficient, has no smiles and lacks that friendly quality, everybody looks stressed. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food and awesome table side guac....  But far from the reviews that everyone gives it.  Average at best."}
{"text":"Nothing special.  Refried bean dip is bland, chips needed salt. The oysters are good! Carne asada was tender but lacked seasoning.  Customer service was good. Would I come  back? ... nope."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here since 1990. It was a little restaurant back then but is now a small local chain. The food is still awesome and always go there to eat whenever I am back home in Vegas."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food, great drinks great appetizers , the staff are very friendly, especially the bartender \"Paola\" she has an amazing personality and very friendly we'll come back again"}
{"text":"Love Lindo always recommend love the music and the food the view is amazing too. It's a great place to take out of town guests . We come here at least once a week. It's even kid friendly"}
{"text":"This place is pretty nice I like the Mexican theme they have going on I go for breakfast several times the servers and bussers are always nice and always checking up on you and they surprised me in my birthday haha"}
{"text":"We visited on a Sunday night over President's Day weekend and it was PACKED - even at 7pm, we had to wait 30 min for a table. The server was decently attentive but kept forgetting the kids' drinks and had to be reminded repeatedly.  The chips are house made, hot, and greasy - beware of filling up on them before the meal comes, especially on a long wait like we had!  And the accompanying dip came in two varieties:  uber spicy salsa (high bar for uber spicy here) and bland bean dip.  I found myself wishing for something moderate. The kids liked the bean dip, however. Thumbs up for the frozen margarita that helped wash it all down (for us -- lemonade for the kiddos :))  .  Do the skinny option for a more authentic experience, if you don't want that nasty sweet and sour mix.  OK - onto the entr√©e.  Everyone seemed  happy with their choice -- my wife got a goat soup that was unusual and tasty, from the bite I had. I got an orange roughy dish that was stuffed with shrimp, octopus, and cilantro/tomato mix, then lightly fried and coated in a creamy sauce that was --  yes, uber spicy!  And delicious.  I found myself wishing for two stomachs and regretting all of those chips, as there was no way I could finish it. All in all, considering that we live in Seattle and yearn for authentic Mexican, this fit the bill with some unique dishes we'd never tried before."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. I was here for a convention and man it was convenient and cheap. Love this place. By far one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service!!! There was always someone close by to refill our chips and drinks. A fun environment on a Saturday night with live music. Our food come out fast and it was hot and delicious. My favorite Mexican restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"Looking for a suitable replacement for the family fave Jalisco.  Need to keep looking.  Been here a couple of times.  Waiters/staff are great, but food only so-so.  Maybe bad menu choices on my part? Clientele was very rude - that left the most memorable impression."}
{"text":"We like this place.  The food is consistently good and the service is generally pretty good too. We especially like the fideo soup, which is a great appetizer.  We also love the mariachi band that performs on occasion."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican restaurant with amazing view  in the city of Henderson. It is almost always packed when ever I come to dine. My husband and I usually grab a drink at the bar and admire the view before being seated. Every time I have dined there has been a mariachi band and live guitarist- makes the experience that more enjoyable. Their chips and salsa are delicious and are also served with bean dip! I usually order the tostada appetizer or the shrimp tacos, both delicious! Amazing food, affordable, and spectacular view of the strip- you can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Excellent food in a great atmosphere! My new favorite Mexican food restaurant in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is just like you've traveled south of the border. The host, waiters and staff were courteous and attentive.  To start our meal we received the chips, salsa, and bean dip and mmmmmm was it authentic and delicious. My meal was preceded by a small bowl of tasty fideo (skinny noodles in a soup). I ordered their two (medium sized) burritos and my wife ordered the mole. Both were exactly what we were looking for.  We arrived during happy hour and we each had a Mango Margarita and they were potent. Just what you're looking for when you're trying to escape the dessert heat.  Well worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Their burritos are incredible the fact that they give you free chips when you walk in there right on top of everything when you need something they open the door for you when you leave and enter and mine favorite part about the entire experience is we get free chips and dip this is my girlfriend's at my favorite spot to eat really good food but yeah"}
{"text":"We came here on Superbowl Sunday which happened to be nice and quite. I was extremely grateful for that!   We started off with the fresh Guacamole dip ($8.25). It is my favorite way to start a Mexican meal! I like the fresh pieces of jalapeno, tomato, onion and a squeeze of lime. I love when  my guacamole has a thick and chunky consistency. This was delicious!   My main dish was the Camarones Abuelito Timo. It was plump Gulf shrimp stuffed with cheese, peppers and wrapped in bacon and deep fried. It was good but not great because it was little bit too salty for me. I had to peel off some of the bacon to make it a little less salty.   I saw that they had a Tres Leche Cake on their dessert menu but they ran out! We settled on a cheesecake that tasted similar to the Tres Leche but it wasn't my favorite. I'm not a big fan of cheesecake but it still tasted decent."}
{"text":"Hanging with a friend while his wife is away we came to check out this location of Lindo thats on the hill that used to be a Carmine's Little Italy. Nice looking place with a great million dollar view of the city through the expansive glass. I ordered the Carnitas which were cooked perfectly crispy and tender with enough fat to stay juicy. My friend had some type of enchilada platter that looked pretty typical. It was a good meal but we later lamented that we should have tried something more \"Authentic\" but played it safe with the tried and true. After dinner spent a few minutes in the parking lot trying to spot distant landmarks."}
{"text":"Came here with some cousins from out of town where great Mexican food is hard to come by. The four of us shared several dishes like the Mole Pablano, Carnitas, Lengue, and some Carne Asada. All of us were satisfied and filled. Nobody wanted dessert but i ordered some churros for the heck of it and they were OK. Gotta come back to try more new items next time."}
{"text":"Always come here when in Vegas.  Yummy food but fill up on appetizers   Could improve the Guacamole and if the rice wasnt in chicken stock that would be great."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas attending a convention and decided to explore where the locals go to eat and stay off the strip.  This place was highly recommended by our hotel so we tried it for dinner our first night in town.  We loved it so much that we went back for lunch on our way to the airport two days later."}
{"text":"I really, REALLY wanted to like this place. I really did. The raves from my personal friends, all the reviews here on Yelp... I promise you, I had high hopes. But overall, it was just average.   I will admit that I am a bit \"Southern California persnickety\" about my Mexican food, but have a pretty good tolerance for even bad Mexican food.  It's grease and meat and cheese and hot sauce -- what's not to love?  Sadly, the food here was neither good, nor bad, it just... was.  Bland is the closest adjective I can give it.  The salsa was bizarre and had strange tangy-ness that was unexpected and off putting. The consistency was kind of like Cholula hot sauce, not a true salsa. The beans were beans, on the loose side, like a dip. Pretty decent, better than the salsa. The chips were fine.  We each ordered fajitas, he steak and I chicken with flour tortillas. The steak, I swear to you, had no flavor at all. It just tasted like cooked meat.  The chicken had slightly more flavor, but really, nothing to write home about. We saw spices on it, but strangely, there were none on our tongues. There was no zing, no heat, no depth, it was just... food.  Now, the tortillas -- those were awesome. Really good tortillas, freshly made.   Where they lacked in the flavor department, they did make up for in service. While we were initially forgotten after being seated way in the back by the toilets, after we reminded them we existed, they were extra attentive. Overly so, even.  I think they could tell that we didn't love our food, as we asked for a box after just a few bites (I decided to try my hand at improving upon the leftovers the next day.) So they were very concerned about us being happy. We said we were and smiled and nodded -- we just didn't have the heart to tell them we thought their food was mediocre. :(  They brought us extra hot tortillas to go, at no additional cost, so we were very appreciative and tipped accordingly.  The meal itself was pretty pricey for a mexican restaurant, in my opinion. $15-$20 a person -- maybe that's the going rate, but I'm used to more $10-$15 a plate, the high end for fajitas.  Our bill, without alcohol was $49, not including tip, pretty high for 2 orders of fajitas, if you ask me, but maybe I'm just that old fart recalling how it used to be a quarter to go to the movies. I don't know.  Anyway, I feel bad for not being totally in love with them. What they lacked in flavor, they made up for in customer service, so 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"We travel from SCAL to Vegas often and NEVER miss an opportunity to visit this restaurant. With all the excellent Mexican offered in Cali, this particular restaurant tops them all. Service is 1st class, seafood prepared to its finest, soups always delicious, combination plates never disappoint and dessert always a treat. We love the wait staff and had the pleasure of meeting the owner Javier. It's been 5 years now and I can't say there's ever been one bad experience here at the Henderson location. Did I mention the view is the best view I've seen in a restaurant in the Vegas area? Try this place and rate it yourself! #BestInVegas2004-2005,2006-2007,2008-2009,2011-2012,2013LasVegasReviewJournalPoll"}
{"text":"Really good food and large portions. The guacamole was delicious, but once you have too much of that (and the chips), you feel really full. So don't eat too much before your actual entre arrives!  We went on a Saturday night, so it was pretty busy. The wait wasn't too bad (about 45 minutes), but the parking was a hassle. My brother had to keep circling the lot while we waited outside. The lot is very small, but the view from there of Las Vegas is beautiful.  Because it was busy, the place was loud. It also seemed like 30 people or parties were celebrating birthdays there because the waiters and waitresses kept singing happy birthday, like, every ten minutes. So this is not the best place to really talk, unless you don't mind yelling over the noise. Maybe it's not as loud on less busy days.  Despite the hectic atmosphere, the service was prompt and everyone was polite and welcoming. I recommend this place for large groups. You'll have a good time."}
{"text":"Anyone who's read my reviews of Mexican restaurants knows that I judge a Mexican restaurant, first, by how they make Chile Relleno... AND then anything else they might have.  My first impression of Lindo Michoacan was that this restaurant does not take Chile Relleno seriously, as the establishment serves it only as an ala-carte item or as an item included within their combination dishes. There are NO entrees with Chile Relleno by itself.... the waiter recommended that I order a couple of Chile Rellenos and just make my own entree... He just does not see the difference!  Chips & Salsa - Large crispy and warm tortilla ccrn chips. Very tasty and appetizing Bean Dip and a Red Chili Salsa concoction. FYI: my kids told me to take it easy on the Chips and Salsa during Lunch, as Lindo Michoacan charges customers at Lunch for extra Chips and Salsa! WTF!!!!  Chili Relleno - Abover average size Chile, but immersed in a very watery, very watery sauce. Relleno disintegrated while it was just sitting there! Ttalking to my Hispanic friends in California, I found out that Relleno are a very difficult item to make...  but Rellenos are also a staple of any Hispanic restaurant.  Camarones Ranchero - Immersed in a watery Ranchero sauce that was reminiscent of the Chile Relleno sauce.... coulda been the same sauce! For $16 the pricing is just way too much money for the below average preparation. There is NOTHING innovative about the recipe for this Shrimp in Ranchero Sauce entree that would justify the high price! Lindo Michoacan should apologize to every customer before seating them on their high prices and below average quality.   Tortillas - Hand-made, home-made flour tortillas.  Besides the Chips and Salsa, the best part of the Lindo Michoacan experience.  I'll temper my two star rating with my kids' above average ratings. They love this Mexican restaurant for some reason. The positives of the home-made Tortillas and the Chips & Salsa does not offset the negatives of watery sauces that smother the Chile Relleno and Camarones Ranchero compounded by the very high prices and below-average service."}
{"text":"I think that I have eaten at all the Michoacan locations through out the valley and the original Lindo Michoacan on Desert Inn is by far the best. It is worth the drive. One of best Mexican restaurants in the city. I love their chips, beans, and salsa that they bring when you first sit down. It never fails that I finish every bit. The fresh guacamole that they make at the table is a must!! The taquitos are so fresh (they make their own home made tortillas). My husband got the whole fried talapia, and devoured every bit. Their super burrito is the biggest burrito I have ever seen, it is also delicious! We have been several times and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Do you like waiting over an hour for service?  Bland chicken in your tacos. And a super noisy environment with a wait staff that barely comes to your table?  Well my friends you have come across just the place to waste your money. Honestly take the trip to rosaritas beach taco shop on horizon ridge this place sucks. Two times I have given it a shot both times same results. But I suppose the veiw is worth taking a date here for drinks, other than that stay away from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Pride of henderson Nevada One of those restaurant that closest late.which is another plus point specially in this place that peoples seems to be up all night. After casino hopping in the strip my cravings for mexican dishes is so intense.  Big restaurant on a hilly part of Henderson,parking is free and in it there is a view deck where you can enjoy the beauty of scenery and the lights from the strip. Mexican inspired decors,im loving everything,from the big wooden door,its like aztec temple.  All servers and receptionist are wearing traditional mexican clothes and they are looking fantastic. Small flatform can be found in the middle of the restaurant,live music is ongoing,mexican songs.  we seated  near a huge glass panel window,view is amazing what a night. Waiter service,excellent service,another place where you can find bilingual crew.our server bytheway is young handsome mexican guy that adds 1 star on my review.  Takes reservation,wifi free and they have big TV screens that plays sports when we came.noise level is morethan average...lots of patrons and there were few b days going on. Full bar,no outside seating,good for all ages,group,family and kids.Accept cash/card/debit.  Foodwise, all the dishes we ordered were all very good we had the carne asada \"don Francesco\"juice tender flank steak grilled with monterey jack cheese enchalada,we had the playa azul a white fish fillet sauted in a delicious spanish sauce made with tomatoes,onions,jalopenos,topped with cheese,i also got the taco a beef taco 1 piece very very good it comes with a holder so your taco will be serve standing on a plate what a brilliant idea.  Aside from from this we had the fresh salsa,freshly made beside your table so fresh so so good. Serving is generous its actually huge,excellent quality and taste is really superb. This is one of so many restaurants that i would visit again and again. i recommend to all locals and tourist like me to visit this place and discover for yourself what a good mexican restaurant is....."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices for delicious food and great service here. My boyfriend and I first dined here a few weeks ago and it's our new favorite Mexican restaurant. It's even better than our beloved Frank & Fina's in Summerlin. The food is amazzinnggg. I have nothing else to say except to be sure to order the guacamole. The servers bring the ingredients to your table and make the guacamole right in front of you so it's fresh. You can also choose to have the flavor taste mild, medium, or hot. Also, try to come early or request a table with a Strip view. The far side of the restaurant behind the bar has a stunning view of the Strip. Definitely recommend to anyone in the mood for great, authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and it was slow so we expected service to be good. We first walked in and got seated right next to music. I was with my 2 year old mind you. Service was incredibly SLOW. our waiter was kinda awkward. He barely checked up on us. He took a while to take our food and it took hike forever to get our check. Hell visit the table next to us but won't check if we need anything. For what you get, it's pretty pricey. They give you chips and salsa-which is really spicy. I ordered the chicken flautas with flour instead or corn. They charge extra for flour. This alone was $15.95. My sister ordered the beef chimichanga for $9.95. Beef was unfortunately dry. We've had better Mexican food to be honest so we probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The queso fundido was pretty amazing as well as the 4 shrimp entrees our table tried. Our waiter Albert was terrific. I'm a native and I don't know why I have never been here before. We will definitely be returning and I don't even mind the 30 minute drive to get here."}
{"text":"I like this spot. I liked the staff, atmosphere and food.  We were in a big hurry and explained this to the waiter, and they brought our food out super quick!  They staff was extremely attentive and friendly.   We ordered the guacamole, which they make fresh right at your table.  It was very good.  Then I orders the steak fajitas.  They were decent, but I've had better. They did however put grilled tomatoes in with the meat, peppers and onions, which I liked. They also have amazing fresh flour tortillas that really helped bring up the flavor in the fajita.   If only I wasn't driving, I would have been able to rate the margaritas for you too.   Overall, I really did like the place. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"\"Javier's\" Lindo Michoacan  Restaurant is one of our favorite restaurants to visit when in Vegas. Food is as close to home made as we can find. Hand made tortillas with butter, awesome Margaritas and great food. Come hungry because the plates are loaded!"}
{"text":"The location is nice, with a lovely view of the city. The good itself was good enough, but not anything to write home about. The service was not so great. We came for lunch, and their lunch specials prices have a drink (soda/tea) included in the price. I didn't see that at first, and our waiter didn't point it out. When I noticed I ordered an iced tea, which didn't come until after the good. We saw our waiter to take our order, otherwise it was someone else assisting us. It wasn't busy at all, so I wasn't pleased with that."}
{"text":"The service is the worst we have ever had here.  The manager took our drink order because our waiter never came.   The food was ok, nothing special and it took forever to get anything done.  This place is not expensive but I would rather pay a higher price for the great service and great food versus ok food and lousy service.  We will not go back to this place unless we are with a large group who chooses to go here."}
{"text":"Cinco De Mayo baby!!!!  They have a pretty good Happy Hour and the lunch menu is available until 5pm, you cannot beat that.  The staff here are amazing, very friendly and attentive.  Even when it gets busy, they try really hard to keep up on making sure your drink is never empty.  What I really like about this place is the number of staff they have working.  There is always someone around to help you if you need something.  The food is not bad, the bartenders make amazing drinks.  Most are young and my friend who loves this place cannot figure out how some of these girls who are 21 and 22 seem to make drinks better then most bartenders in town. For me, I don't try and figure things like that out, I just say \"give me a drink\" and I am happy.  This place is awesome and you should try it out if you have the chance."}
{"text":"The food and service are generally excellent and professional.  To enhance this experience, they need to double the parking spaces.  The facility also needs to double the restroom facilities.Awful lot of customers for one crapper!"}
{"text":"Had fajita burrito and my wife had chiles rellenos,  great taste. Didn't have drinks but the margaritas looked tentive to drink. The chips, salsa and beans just great. Price is a little high but worth it and service is really good but the need to touch the table a little more frequently."}
{"text":"Although a little pricy, I found everything we tried to be presented well and great tasting. The service was also excellent and friendly.  I don't live in Las Vegas or go to this area very often, however if I was in the area I definitely would be back."}
{"text":"The food here is fairly tasty and the service is good.  Mainly, I lowered the rating because of the ridiculous pricing.  I am from a border town in Texas where just about anything on Lindo's menu would sell for $12 or less.  A plate of chile Verde shouldn't be 20$.  We aren't on the strip and there is no valet parking.  The only way I would consider going back is for lunch, where many of their plates are nearly half price.  The portions aren't extraordinary either.  If you're a tourist from the midwest and Mexican food is scarce, you will love this place.  Personally I'd go across the street to the restaurant in the La Bonita grocery store and stop by the bakery on the way out."}
{"text":"WE HAD OUR CREDIT CARD INFO STOLEN FROM THIS PLACE!!  BEWARE!! We ate lunch here one afternoon about a month ago.  My partner used his business card as it was a business lunch - hasn't used this card in 6 months.  Well one of the tons of different staff that served us is a THIEF and skimmed the card and security code!  Two weeks later someone in New York is trying to use a perfect replica of the card to make purchases at gas stations and food.  Our credit card company caught if quickly as we have zero connections to New York.  Beware. They hired a roach of a person.  The nachos are not worth it!  I contacted a manager but for all I know he's in on the scam.  It was absolutely THIS place!"}
{"text":"Excellent service  Food was amazing and fresh to the table!  Servers were very friendly and very fast! We were treated like family. Definitely would come back here again!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I can't say enough good things about it. I've never waited more than 10 minutes to be seated, even on super busy weekends.   I love that their chips come with salsa roja AND beans! A lot of the meals come with sopa de fideo too! The fideo soup is way too good. The fatty in me wishes the bowl was a bit bigger though.   Their ceviche is also incredibly good. I usually get the flautas and it comes with beans and rice. It's absolutely filling!   Also, on some days (I think weekends), they have live mariachi!"}
{"text":"Best food, best service, best atmosphere - this place has it all.  Friendly people and yes it is always packed and noisy - but that is because the food is so excellent!  After eating here every other place that I used to enjoy just doesn't cut it.  This place in addition to common Mexican items features an impressive array of sea food dishes as well - all tortillas are made fresh by hand right there - you can see them being made and believe me fresh is much better than refrigerated.  The chips, salsa and bean dip are the best in town.  Try the, \"Uropan\" combination - the green chilli is incredible - Don't miss out - go!"}
{"text":"What a cool spot with an incredible view of the city! I have not had a chance to eat here yet but i did have the pleasure of drinking two delicious and perfectly made chamucos margaritas. Ill tell you, i am a true tequila lover and it is hard to find a good selection of tequila, let alone a good margarita and this place has both!   Plus, the chips and salsa and dip they bring out are incredible!"}
{"text":"Not really into Mexican food but this is definitely the best in Henderson,  NV.  They make the guacamole dip right in front of you. Food was fantastic and the view was amazing.  Great place to go if your looking for a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our lunch here today! The view was amazing, service was great, and the food was good. Can't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"Had a pretty good lunch here today. Husband had the beef in chili colorado and I had chipotle chicken. Both were delicious. Both came with soup and the tortillas are hand made here."}
{"text":"After many suggestions from friends and coworkers to come to Lindo Michoac√°n... Jacob and I finally did! I would just like to say.... we are not disappointed!  This is probably the best Mexican restaurant I have been to since I've moved to Las Vegas, and going out for tacos doesn't count. When I want mexican food... I mean, rice and beans with chips and salsa on the table, and not small tapas or modern style Mexican food that's going to cost me next months rent.   When we came in we were friendly greeted by the hosts who promptly sat us as a table. Not only were we greeted by our server quickly, but we also had a very attentive busperson who frequently came to check on us. She refilled our drinks before they were empty, and would check on us frequently to make sure everything was okay and we had everything we needed.   A few minutes after reviewing the menu, we were greeted by our server who was very informative about the menu. He was quick to give recommendations when asked and quickly delivered hot chips and spicy salsa which a side of creamy refried beans! I was in love with the slight kick their red salsa came in, and knowing it's not their spiciest makes me even happier!  There's is one thing that I love.... spicy food! When we came in and I realized this place is known for the spiciest dish in Las Vegas... I had to try it.   Few had stated that their servers had persuaded them to eat something differently because of the spiciness. Our server stated that on a scale from 1-10, this was a 50.... so I ordered it, of course. And he wasn't lying. Even though I asked for half of my carnitas to be the Cry Today Cry Tomorrow, I quickly was holding back tears and my entire mouth from my lips to my gums had gone numb from the ghost peppers. Now, those who love spicy food will roll their eyes and come here to try it anyways, which I respect and encourage! If you can handle it. It is worth trying one time. The carnitas melt in your mouth and that flavor is irreplaceable. HOWEVER! It's been over 24 hours and my stomach is still upset from having a half portion of their ghost pepper salsa. So, if eating a raw jalape√±o is too hard for you, just ask for a side of the Cry Today Cry Tomorrow salsa to try with your chips first.   On a side note! Jacob ordered the Chile colorado, which he swears is the best he ever had, and quickly finished before I could even take a picture!  This is the first but certainly not the last time Lindo Michoac√°n has seen us! I am ecstatic to try out the many wonderful dishes served here!  Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Wow best mexican food in Vegas!! Coming from LA it has been a rough 3  1/2 years trying to find a good mexican spot. Best service I have had ever at a restaurant. Very attentive staff and amazing atmosphere. The view at this location is spectacular. If you are planning on a date night, you can call and make reservation. A great view of the valley. It is worth the drive from mountains edge. They had live music on Friday. Very good place. My husband did good by bringing me here. Real authentic cooks! Love this place!! P.S. The only bad thing is when you leave, the smokers congregate and smoke right in front of the restaurant entrance. So gross for someone who loathes the smell of cigarettes ."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for overt 15 years and have never been disappointed. A great menu to chose from, excellent service at very fair prices. The food is always fresh and well prepared. Ciao"}
{"text":"I've never seen my cousin dig in so much, and he is a pretty sharing guy but this time he could not share his tacos. He told me to stop him from eating more complimentary chips and salsa by slapping him, and of course I was glad to do that (I ended up almost slapping him because he broke his say but he stopped me before I could). They give you refills if you order drinks (get horichata!). I know you would mot normally order a fish dish as a main in Mexican restaurants but me and my dads favorites was the tilapia, which was huge! But it was perfectly cooked; so crispy on the outside and tender in the inside.   The ambiance is very fun and cheerful and its very authentic. Serving portions are huge, and lots of complimentary chips and salsa (refills too) along with homemade tortillas (get corn tortillas) and even soup."}
{"text":"Service was seriously lacking on my visit to Leave Lindo. I have been wanting to try since it opened and I was disappointed in the service and the food. I was excited because this place has one of the best views in town and because I love Mexican food. A friend's birthday is what brought us to this restaurant.   We had a reservation for 13 people. We showed up on time and we're still waiting to be seated. The waiting area was packed and most of my party had to stand directly in front of someone that was seated, butt to their face. I also had to keep moving so the servers could get by since the waiting area is blocking the exit for the kitchen. Staff seemed over whelmed with the amount of people. I was overwhelmed with the amount of people.  After being seated we received glasses of water, chips, salsa, & beans. The table was so small that it didn't really have enough room to put food in the middle. I know I am a large man but I also did not feel I had a comfortable amount of room to be seated for dinner.   Hot delicious beans made me happy. The chips were amazing. Continuously being refilled with fresh chips that were hot and fresh which in the end was confusing because this wasn't the same for my meal    It was about 20 minutes before our drink order was taken. Drinks came quickly. About another 20 minutes before the order was taken. I believe our chips were refilled 3 times before we had our order taken. Everyone was getting stuffed on chips. They were honestly perfect.   When the food came I was very excited. I loved the presentation of the nacho appetizer I order as an entire plus carne asada. The person seated next to me order the exact same thing. As she took a bite I commented on the presentation and how nice it was. She commented on how the chips were burned and the steak was flavorless.    I began to grab for a chip. These chips were not the same ones from the table. I don't think they were made from the same tortilla either. They were like fat uncrispy wedges. When I put it in my mouth I could taste what tasted like burnt oil. The first thought in my mind was OMG the bright me a plate of chips that were fried then refried to heat them up. The taste of extra oil was apparent.   I almost didn't believe that the steak could be flavorless. It was. I felt like I was being punished for ordering an appetizer as an entree. When the server came by I made my first food complaint of my life and it was one of the hardest things I have ever done. I am upset I didn't complain more after my experience.   I told the server the issue with our plates. He quickly grabbed the food and said I'll get a manager. The manager asked us if we wanted anything else? The truth of the matter is that I wanted the nachos on the fresh hot chips they had kept bringing to the table, not the ones they had reheated for my entree. He said ok and that was that. They removed it from the bill with out saying anything.   I feel like the manager could have made some type of attempt of apologizing. I sat there for over an hour before food was brought to the table. Quickness wasn't the impression that was left by Lindos service so the real reason I didn't order anything else was because by the time the food comes in afraid everyone else would be finished.   We also had a friend at the table with cold fries. There was obviously a problem in the kitchen tonight. Just wish I could have had a great experience here. The prices weren't outrageous but they wee higher than going to a taco shop where you can get quality food and quick service."}
{"text":"The food has really gone downhill. My daughter even complained her chicken was overlooked and she is 7. The fajitas had no flavor. The service is terrible when it is busy. No excuse. I don't know if it is just this location or what but I will not come back to this one. I came for lunch recently and we didn't enjoy it then either."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to place in Las Vegas.  Any night of the week, the place is packed.  You will be waiting on a Friday and Saturday night.  The table side guacamole is awesome, I get it every time I am there.  The food is more on a traditional Mexican side, not the fancy stuff you get on the strip. If you have a rental car, it is worth the drive. I will go back the next time I am in Vegas, for sure."}
{"text":"Lindo Michoacan is another West Vegas secret I will gladly expose for my yelp-ographic experience. Located at Hualapai and Flamingo, it's about a 5 minute drive from where I live and quite awesome. I think of Lindo as the perfect \"step-up\" from Roberto's Taco Shop, a sit down custom mexican spot. My last visit in October was really great: service was outstanding, no wait, and my food was immpeccable. I usually order the steak cilantro with extra tortillas and guacamole, perfection. Another great secret, revealed ^_^"}
{"text":"Meal was great, food authentic and great tasting service was good,waiter always follow up"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Las Vegas! We eat here from time to time because the service is great, the food is amazing and they have a fantastic view of the LV strip!"}
{"text":"Their Chips and Beans are going to be the death of me! It's like you can't stop eating them and as soon as you are finished they bring more. It's so bad that we can't shop in the mall across the street because we know where we will end up! It doesn't hurt that the service is fantastic, the traditional Mexican menu is filled with fantastic items like the fido soup... But those chips and beans get in your head and start calling to you..."}
{"text":"Place was bomb, second time here. I ordered the machaca and can't complain about anything. All the staff was super friendly!"}
{"text":"Great service, excellent traditional Mexican food and good drinks.   My order was actually brought to me incorrect made. It was a big deal. I just didn't want pico on one of my tacos. When I mentioned it the bartender immediately took it back and I was brought a replacement taco expeditiously. Best traditional Mexican food in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food at this restaurant and my husband and I make it a point to eat here whenever we are in town. Delicious Mexican food with an awesome view of the strip. Fantastic!   My only complaint is that the portion sizes are really too large for one person. I don't like eating leftovers and so it just seems wasteful. They give you free chips served with bean dip and salsa as soon as you sit down and those are just to good to not eat. Plus, most meals come with a starter of fideo soup.  In addition, most of the entrees come with a heaping helping of rice and beans. The best remedy to the superfluous amount of food is to split an entree with someone or just order a la cart (though those items are limited).  My favorite meal here is the Shrimp Diablo. Tell them to make it extra spicy and you will be in for a real treat. I also love their Micheladas (that is my favorite drink to eat with Mexican food), though they call them something else here.  I love the upbeat atmosphere though sometimes when they have music it can get too loud.  We have always had excellent service from the waitstaff though I have noticed that the hostesses all seem to have some kind of chip on their shoulders.  As others have mentioned, try to avoid peak times or you will have trouble with parking and likely have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"I feel like everyone goes nuts for this place. But I don't really see why. It's over-priced mediocre food that you can get at a more charming mom & pop business that's less expensive and with better quality.   The Good: -fried ice cream -giant sombrero that they make you wear while they sing the happy birthday song -the shot of tequila that they slam on the table after they sing to you (better drink that sucker fast!) -the soup that you get at the beginning of each meal (which is a little bit of a stretch putting it in the 'good' category since I think it's a little too salty)  The Bad: -over hyped salty food -prices"}
{"text":"I can honestly say the food was excellent! Those homemade tortillas that lady was making next to my booth smelt so good & were so fresh! The hot refried beans and homemade salsa and chips kept coming and coming!  The Happy Hour 50% of margaritas were bomb & I don't like tequila and they made it with rum instead and the Strawberry One it's a must have! If you like true authentic Mexican cuisine stop here!! You won't find anything like this on The Strip especially if you are just visiting here!"}
{"text":"For the first time, reviews are actually accurate!   Sauces on every dish are tasty and great.. Carnitas, pollo sarandiado, guac, cabrito stew, fish tacos all winners.    This one has been bookmarked!   We'll be back"}
{"text":"This is a warning for vegetarians going to Lindo Michoacan.  First, great view, nice servers, and delicious chips/salsa.  However, all of their refried beans, including the bean dip served with the chips, are made with lard.  Their rice uses chicken broth.  This is fine if you think to ask.  Unfortunately, you might think ordering off of their vegetarian menu safeguards you.  It does not.  The vegetarian items are served with larded beans and chicken broth rice.  I ate there a year before realizing it.  My fault, I know, but now you know better."}
{"text":"Food and service were just \"so-so\". We were in the bar area. Our server paid very little attention to us and many times just forgot to bring what we asked for. That was very disappointing. The busser was actually MUCH more helpful. As for the food my friend ordered \"Mojara\" and that was delicious. However, my \"Enchiladas Suizas\" were not very tasty. I lived in Mexico for 10 years - there, they would always serve them in red sauce with melted cheese on top. Not here."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Mexican restaurant to date! I visit at least 2-3 times per month and I've never had a bad experience in any regard. I attended a family dinner here earlier in the evening and it was only a 5 minute wait to seat all 15 of us (we were assholes and didn't even make a reservation beforehand so bonus points for them being able to accommodate all of us so gracefully). At no point did I have to ask to have my drink refilled (and I go through a glass of coke in like 5 minutes flat you should see it in person) and the waiters were extremely attentive. The food is amazing; I usually get the chicken enchiladas and the fideo soup. The interior of the restaurant itself is super cute--lots of Latin American inspired decor and they frequently have a live performer who sings and plays on a keyboard. I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you haven't tried it yet. If you decide to go, play a little prank on the person joining you and tell the wait staff that it's their birthday. Trust me, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The food, which was average, was generic Mexican food. However, what prompted me to write a review was an incident that took place during our meal. One of the members of my party had her purse stolen off of the back of her chair by either an employee or another patron. When the issue was raised, the restaurant staff responded horribly, and refused to call the police or check the tapes until the following day. When the manager was called to the table, his response was, \"so, you're going to go file a report, right?\" My friend, obviously distraught, was shown no empathy or compassion and it seemed like every manager and employee we spoke to was incompetent and confused. Oh! And they proceeded to bring her her bill at the end of the meal, to which my other friend replied, \"she will pay her bill when you find her wallet.\" After some persuasion, they comped her meal. Not a good experience. This was my first time here and I will not be back."}
{"text":"C'mon, Vegas,  \"eight years in a row,\" are you kidding me? \"The best restaurant in Vegas.\" The only good thing about this place is the majestic views. Other than that the food is lame, the service is terrible, and the price is exorbitant.  Well,  the real estate justified the prices. So in a way we agreed on to pay top dollar for what ever we ate there. The chips and salsa were good. My order was all screwed up.  I ordered a shrimp cocktail that my server forgot about it. My fried fish wasn't cooked with the right sauce.  So my server apologized and decided to send it back to the kitchen. In retrospect I. Wish he would have been allowed me to participate in suchlike decision.  But not.  He just took the fish back. The kitchen slapped the fish with the aforementioned sauce and refried the same fish one more time. The ensuing outcome was logical: my fish was with crust harder than a rock. Now you could say: everyone can make a two mistakes in one order. But the table right behind send their order back because meat wasn't properly cooked. One more gripe.  The server  and busboy insisted on calling me Amigo.  Amigo is a term of endearment.  So I wanted to lecture them on the proper etiquette. I just left the cafeteria bland taste food with fantastic views behind with a Texas-size disappointment."}
{"text":"Brought my mom to celebrate her b.day! Food was great until the end! A party of 60 came in. They started moving tables and seating people. Little by little all the tables were being filled up by one party and our table was the only one they were waiting for. About 6 people were standing around us waiting for us to leave! I felt like I couldn't enjoy my fried ice cream or my parents company. I felt rushed to leave!"}
{"text":"The service was wonderful. Great atmosphere. Amazing micheladas. The food was awful though- get a new chef! Great traditional recipes done wrong."}
{"text":"It's one of my family's favorite Mexican sit down places. The food is good, the service is efficient & the portions are huge! Plus, the chips beans and salsa are addicting!"}
{"text":"I came in with a party of 10 for a celebration dinner. The service was great. They made sure our drinks were full and we were content. It was very loud inside so you won't be able to talk much. The food was good but average in my opinion. I loved the margaritas! I'd definitely return again for happy hour."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. I love the service and the dishes are always great. The pricing is reasonable and the staff is always standing by!"}
{"text":"Great service, great prices, and awesome food. Handmade tortillas are bomb!! Being from phoenix and favoring the more \"hole in the wall\" authentic Mexican food, this place was a highlight of our Vegas trip. Real quick off the 515 too. Great tasting food and tons of choices!!"}
{"text":"Best,best ,best Resturant they attend to you right away  second time being in vegas................................... I love the strongest  Margaritas"}
{"text":"Came for a family members birthday dinner.. made the reservation two days before hand & waited 2 hours to be seated. Several people with no reservation were seated before us and they left before we were even seated!  The managers were so rude & the hostesses were acting as if we were a bother to them.  When we said we were leaving to go somewhere else they all of a sudden had a table ready.. & offered us complimentary margaritas... to the teens in our group..  Very disappointed. On a lighter side, at least the food came out faster than expected."}
{"text":"Friends, DW, and I dined here 01/08/12.  This is a great off the strip Mexican restaurant.  Arriving in the evening after dark, the restaurant does not look very inviting.  However, based on yelp reviews we sucked it up and went in.    Interior is nicely decorated if not a little dark in one room.    Service staff were outstanding across the board.  We ordered guacamole which was prepared table side.  Fresh ingredients make such a difference!  Neither of our friends \"liked\" guacamole, but I can tell you they helped us polish it off down to the last chip!  Margaritas were very good.  Beers were cold and served with chilled mug which is always a nice touch.  Entrees were all outstanding.  Among the 4 of us we ordered 1 burrito, 2 Carne Asada dishes, and Carnitas.  All were excellent, with the accompanying homemade tortillas being an excellent treat!  and when I say homemade I don't refer to the tortilla pressing machine that I have seen in other Mexican restaurants.  Sylvia was making them by hand throughout the evening.  We love Las Vegas and go about once a year, and will definitely come to Lindo Michoacan again."}
{"text":"This place by far my favorite restaurant off the strip!  The margaritas are the best, fideo soup is delicious!  Everything about it is superb!"}
{"text":"I love this place ! If you're ever in Vegas and love Mexican food don't sleep on this place !!! Thank you for the amazing hospitality  makes me feel right back in Mexico ."}
{"text":"Lunch service in west Las Vegas location. This must be some place since everyone was of Latin decent. This place is kid friendly. Good lunch choices from 10-16 dollars. Taco enchiladas etc served with refried beans and rice with beverage service, chips and cup of soup.  I had chille rellenos with shrimp, generous portion with white wheat tortillas.  Cost about 10$ per person. Well worth its local reputation."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is awesome! Family friendly! And an epic view!! I love how they always offer our 1 year old their tasty soup asap so he isn't waiting really recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place does not even deserve one star! I ordered 2 cheese enchiladas which had soooo much sauce, you couldn't even see the cheese or tortilla. The food also made me sick all night. Called to let them know it was bad and  I was dismissed! I will NEVER eat here again! Disgusting!"}
{"text":"best Mexican food in the whole town ! has a good bar where the drinks are very good . great menu lots of options . food comes very fast . there are a few of these places around town but by far this is the best . the staff is always ready to help you with what ever you need. and when it is all said and done the price is very fair."}
{"text":"Amazing view of the Vegas Strip!  I had a tamal and  enchalada dish that was lacking in flavor.  The house blended Margarita was a 10/10.  Great waiter service.  Very loud environment...to the point I found myself almost having shout to talk with somebody sitting across from me. All in all I would go back just for view."}
{"text":"My favorite mexican food place in the Vegas valley. Best skinny margarita to boot!! I take back any negative thing I've ever said about this place. Strike my last review. This spot is the biz. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Loved the original location on Desert Inn, so when I moved to Henderson in 2011, I looked forward to having many a meal at this location.  AMAZING!! Mole Poblamo is my favorite!! Servers and hostesses are so friendly. And the ambiance is only topped by the beautiful view of the Las Vegas Valley!!"}
{"text":"The carnitas was really really good! Atmosphere was also wonderful with the beautiful views of Las Vegas. Miguel was an excellent server!!"}
{"text":"Come into town 2times a year and eat here.  Not anymore.  The entire place has changed from service to food.  The service was slow as it took an hour to get our entrees and they were cold, not hot or even warm.  The chips are not the same: they are thick, hard, tasteless.  The red salsa had a horrible metallic off taste.  When we told the waiter he said it was fresh but would bring us more: it had the same horrible taste. It was inedible. The entrees we're all bland, greasy and not served warm.  So disappointing."}
{"text":"This restaurant's view makes it worth it!  It is built into a hill and an entire wall is glass overlooking the Las Vegas area. You can see the strip and everything.   As soon as you sit down, they serve you warm, freshly made chips, warm bean dip, and salsa. As soon as the basket gets low (and it will because it's delicious), they refill it.   The menu is huge and has a lot of variety. They have a lot of unique dishes in addition to the standard dishes you find at most Mexican restaurants.   I ordered the chicken quesadilla. It came with guacamole and sour cream. The flour tortillas looked home made. The quesadilla was pretty good overall, but it was a bit on the bland side.   The restaurant is quite loud. They sing live music loudly, and people talk loudly. It is pretty hard to hear others at the table. We weren't even there when it was very busy, and I couldn't hear others at the table well."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of their table side made guac.  The chicken isn't that great but that's beef is moist and tender."}
{"text":"One of our favorite stops for Mexican. Loud and lively, you feel like you are in Mexico witha beautiful view of the strip in the distance. I never deviate, getting the chicken burrito platter with all the traditions , rice and refried beans. I also love their margaritas. Always a winner in my book."}
{"text":"About 30 of us came in from out of town to celebrate my mom's 60th birthday.  I did a little research trying to find an amazing Mexican Restaurant and hit the bulls-eye!    AWESOME customer service!    Every time I called the restaurant to coordinate or ask questions about our upcoming dinner, they were super friendly and appeasing!  They had no problem letting me bring in a cake and actually let me drop it off the evening before to keep in their refrigerator (sneaking in the back door so I didn't have to get caught up in the huge line upfront)!   It was just a wonderful experience - the staff was fun, polite and very attentive!    The food was great -  I wasn't the biggest fan of what I had ordered (Gallo al Mojo de Ajo - just wasn't my cup of tea) but ended up nibbling off of my mom's burrito (and taking the rest back to my hotel) and it was AMAZING!    The best part of the night was when they came out to sing Happy Birthday to my mom, aunt and great uncle (who turned 80!).  They must have had pretty much the whole staff come out to sing with surprise tequila shots!  I had read some of the reviews before and so I knew it was going to happen, but totally blanked until moments before!  I just wished I had grabbed my phone to record it because it was HILARIOUS!!!    Thank you for such a wonderful time and thank you for the awesome customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Love the horchata! And of course all the yummy food! Last time I came I was 9 months pregnant (about to pop) and drank about 7 cups of horchata lol and the busser (don't remember his name) was definitely on top of filling up my cup every 5 minutes!! Great service very friendly"}
{"text":"Bland.  That is the single term I would use to describe this meal.  Even the \"spicy\" table side guac was bland.  The chile colorado wasn't that great.  A few pieces of the meat were really fatty, and they do the version which is cooked to order and not the version in which the meat simmers in the chile sauce for hours.  To make it worse, they must have had some \"bring your screaming young child\" promotion or something.  For that I blame the parents for not giving enough of a shit about teaching their kids about proper public/restaurant etiquette."}
{"text":"This place has the best customer service and FOOD! It's our families favorite Mexican restaurant! The food never fails us:) I especially love the unlimited amounts of chips, salsa and beans. Our kids love the Fideo soup that comes with each meal. Yummo!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Service is excellent! Consistent quality and quantity. Best mexican food experience next to home cooked. Reccomend the carnitas coca-cola, tableside guacamole app, and cadilac margaritas!"}
{"text":"Our favorite local Mexican restaurant. Good chips and salsa/bean dip! The chicken mole is the best in town! Great views of the strip too, go after dark to see all the lights on the strip!  Servers are friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"love this place.. excellent service amazing food and the preparadas amaziing!! by far our favorite place to eat #familyfriendly"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!! I'm going to try to make this review short.  The food is outstanding! Bacon wrapped shrimp is to die for.  The handmade guacamole (which is made in front of you) is probably the best i've ever had.  The service is very on point! Our server was humorous yet still very professional.  I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"The search is finally over, no more hunting for the best Mexican food in Vegas. The view is amazing and the food leaves you speechless. I will be back again and again and again."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food! The decor is a bit less like the taquerias in California, but more similar to the Mexican chains in CA or Tex Mex chains on the east coast -- cheesy, homey atmosphere, with the familiar margarita glasses and heavy plates. The menu is comprehensive -- a lot of generic Mexican dishes you would expect, plus Michoacan specialties.  I got the carnitas, and man, was it good. It was not the deep fried kind, but rather, slow cooked and stewed, which made it really flavourful. The green sauce complemented it well, and the rice and beans were good as well. It was a really big plate though, plus I always fill up on chips because I love salsa, so share plates if you need to. I barely finished half of my plate!  Service was a bit slow, but overall not too bad. I just want to taste those carnitas again..."}
{"text":"Great fresh food with very nice staff. Live mariachi on the weekend is very talented. Love the bar area for a couple drinks and relaxation."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with the bf on New Year's Eve. The restaurant was lively and full of smiling patrons.   Pros: We were greeted with a smile from the hostess and seated almost immediately upon arrival. Quickly after being seated, we were served chips, salsa, and beans for dipping. We ordered from the lunch menu, which included a drink (and 1 free refill) with the meal. The prices were great. I ordered a shrimp dish and my bf ordered the taco salad. Portion sized were decent.   Cons: Only one round of chips and salsa. We weren't offered a second batch with our meal. Food didn't have as much spice or flavor as I anticipated.   Although the flavor of the food could've been better, the 4-star rating is for the service, prices, and overall ambiance of the restaurant. We will be back the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food hookup in Las Vegas.  The food is delicious and very flavorful.  This is my fifth visit here and I am always very satisfied when I leave.  They always seat you quickly and they are so happy to see you.  We ordered guacamole with habanero chili it was so hot and delicious.   Today I had the chili verde. The pork was tender and juicy.  My honey had the chicken mole poblano it was very good.  My brother from another mother had a delicious cilantro steak.  Everything was great.  A must come see taste and drink place to be in Vegas!! Thank you Javier & Alex for great service and Luis you have a great team. I'm sure because you are an awesome manager.  I love it here we will definitely return!!    **** Location a little off the beaten path.   ***** Food  ****** Service  *****. Ambiance"}
{"text":"I visited Original Lindo Michoacan in May while in Vegas for the Mayweather-Pac fight. A group of us took cabs from the strip to the restaurant.  1. The service was great 2. The food was just ok. I've eaten    Mexican food for over 35 years. It was just ok. 3. The margaritas were the worst I've EVER had. You can't be a good Mexican restaurant and have terrible margaritas.....  With that said, I won't return when I'm in Vegas this September for another Mayweather fight. I had read so many positive reviews but I was thoroughly unimpressed. My reputation as a foodie took a hit from the group I had brought there...."}
{"text":"They offer some decent lunch options. They seem to be good for classic streetcars types of dishes. We don't like their lengua or mole much though."}
{"text":"They have it down to a T - they're quick to bring out waters without asking, chips salsa and beans automatically, and fideo soup before your meal. Staff is well trained and fast paced. Food is amazing and you just can't beat price for what your getting! There's no secret why they do so well."}
{"text":"Why would you eat at this cartoonish, small-children-infested sideshow when you could eat at Frank & Fina's across the street?!  We almost walked out as soon as we walked in, and I wish that we had.  When you walk into this restaurant, the ambiance stresses you out. The fake Mexican decor and the immense amount of noise in the place are just too much. If you want a peaceful meal, eat elsewhere.   The food was laughable, though the waiters were friendly."}
{"text":"Looking for a fast and reasonably good lunch option around Desert Inn and Eastern? Lindo should make your short list. They have reasonably priced lunch specials and they are slightly overstaffed which helps to get you in and out pretty fast if you need to get on with your day.   I've had my share of experiences with Lindo...look at my previous reviews, it's a love - hate thing. They've messed up my orders. They can't seem to refill the salsa and sometimes the chips. And no not everyone wants fried fish tacos. But sometimes none of that crap matters. You go in and don't have to wait forever to be seated. And you'll don't pay out the nose for what you get. Sometimes...that's all you need.   Back up to 3 stars...and removed from a special list."}
{"text":"Best Lindo Michoac√°n in Vegas.  Really good food and great customer service.  Came for Father's Day, we had to wait but it was expected especially on a holiday.  One downside. Music was a loud.  But I left with a happy belly.  I recommend this place for any occasion.  Probably best Mexican food in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on friends recommendation and it did not disappoint.  We typically stay on the strip so this was quite a venture out for us.  I believe that there is a closer one to the strip...but we had to check out the \"original\" one. We came on a friday night at 6:30pm and found it starting to fill up. Location/Ambience:  About 15mins from the strip.  Easy to find and plenty of parking in the back.  The vibe was chill.  Decorated in traditional mexican decor.  Restrooms were clean.  They would arrange tables to fit group size. Service:  This was the best service at a Mexican restaurant that I have ever received.  we were greeted and shown to a table right away.  As soon as we sat down, chips/salsa/beans (yes beans) were placed in front of us.  Multiple people would stop by and ask if everything was ok.  Great recommendations.  Loved the fact that there was a lady making fresh tortillas in the corner.  Food came out at a decent pace.  Drinks came out super fast.   Food:  The menu was definitely extensive.  Nicely organized by proteins.  LOts of things I wanted to try.  I loved the chips/salsa/beans.  NOt terribly spicy but got a nice heat to the salsa.  I opted fro the Buey Al Cilantro (on server recommendation).  I have never ordered a steak (rib eye) from a mexican restaurant, but this turned out to be fantastic.  IT was cooked perfectly medium.  But what made it awesome was the cilantro/onion/chile verde sauce.  It was really really good.  I would cut a strip, add some beans/rice, and eat it with their tortilla.  I'm still thinking about that dish.  Great value at $20 too.  My wife got a seafood soup and that had some nice flavor as well.  The mango margarita was a tad too sweet.  But the original one was great.   I would definitely recommend this place.  I would love to return and try out the other items."}
{"text":"Server team was really on point. Very on top of things. The speed of service could have been a little slowed down. I get it they are going into prime time and want to turn tables, but you shouldn't go so fast that guests feel rushed. Not saying it was bad or intentional. They were just so on top of things they were focused on speed. Hence the 4 stars not 5. Excellent dinner overall. Were already talking about when we were going back. Excellent view of the city. Congratulations to a family that has been working for many years in this city opening one successfull store after another.  We definitely overate. Who order 3 desserts for 4 ppl at a mexican restaurant?"}
{"text":"Have been here several times. Sometimes it's off the hook and other times is so very disappointing  if you come in after 8 pm food is totally inconsistent-- carne asada tacos came out as if meat was boiled grey looking horrible. The time before early evening it was amazing dark, caramelized the way it should be. Another time rice was so hard and crusted!! They should be ashamed to serve that--if too late to make more then offer fries something else instead of serving a staple --Mexican  rice that old and dry. I just don't understand why so inconsistent??? For as many years as they've been voted  \"The Best\" it makes no sense. Also if you dine late night expect to eat in silence  after 10 not even overhead music, even if customers are still arriving as they advertise open till midnight."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised they were opened until midnight on the weekends. The restaurant is perched up on a hill so a lovely view of the city went well with the friendly and welcoming staff. I was worried were coming in half an hour before closing that the staff would be weary and that the kitchen was closed, but the hostess was enthusiastic and we were seated right away. The restaurant is quite big and decorated tastefully with rustic decor without being cheesy.   Complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip came out first. It was ok. I had the carne asada nachos, fajita steak burrito, and chicken quesadilla. The chips in the carne asada nacho was a little greasy, but the meat itself was good. The portions we're big, well seasoned, not salty, and the service was attentive. This is a good place to have dinner dates or get togethers with friends and family since the city view makes a nice backdrop. I would definetly come back to try out their drinks and try their other specialities."}
{"text":"I've been here more times than I can recall, since my fianc√© and I frequent this spot with his family for birthdays, Mother's Day, and Father's Day yearly, and with their large menu, I'm never bored.  I've also had the opportunity to sit in different areas of the restaurant, my favorite being near the windows and wonderful view of the valley. The service has also always been wonderful. Prompt refills of beverages and the complimentary chips, salsa, and bean dip! The food arrives quickly too. General manager, Gerardo is extremely kind and so accommodating. I've made reservations with him and he comes through with the best table in the house for our special occasions!  The food is where I'm a bit torn. I've had really good dishes and I've had \"shrug-worthy\" dishes. Like I said, I'm never bored - it's always an adventure to try another dish and not knowing how good it'll be with just the short menu description. Primarily, the dishes lack proper seasoning (a little salt can go a long way people!) and that takes away from the complex flavors. However, the dishes that I've enjoyed had developed the flavors completely and thus, were very memorable.  One dish I have really enjoyed was the POLLO en PIPIAN. A juicy chicken breast filet served with a delicious Aztec mole (sauce). The flavors in the sauce are deep and just create a different experience for your chicken. Lately, I've been gravitating toward the \"Especialidades del Mar\" (specifically the shrimp) section and I'm glad I made the leap! They use large Mexican Gulf shrimp and it is always prepared perfectly! Fresh, juicy, succulent, with a nice bite. I really enjoyed this preparation in the CHILES RELLENOS de CAMARON where the shrimp was saut√©ed in olive oil, white wine, onions, tomato, cilantro, and jalape√±o. A big heap was then placed on top of two roasted pasilla chiles, then topped with cheese. Delicious!!   My fianc√© and I always order completely different dishes, which is wonderful since I get to try things I wouldn't think of ordering and it normally turns out that his selection is more tasty than mine! I like to think that this is because he's not as concerned about ordering healthy dishes as I am, not because he's a better \"orderer\" lol. Anyway, I can't remember his dishes (not does he), but there were several we have both really liked! Essentially, we don't order the typical Mexican-American fare of burritos, nachos, enchiladas, or fajitas. I did order their Chimichanga once and that was a mistake. Perhaps these items are not their strong points? Either way, I like the specialities with moles or diabla sauces, meats saut√©ed in olive oil, lemon, and white wine, rather than slathered in cheese.  Overall, I always have great dining experiences here. I never have to worry about long waits, lacking service, or really bad food. I am torn between three and four stars since my food experience is inconsistent, but my likelihood to return is very high, thus four stars.  BTW, they are extremely busy on holidays!! I suggest making a reservation, if possible, or expecting a little wait (it's never been long). Also, the parking lot across Carnegie has been opened for restaurant patrons, so you don't have to resort to parking on the hilly street (which we have had to do many times in the past)."}
{"text":"Great food. Salsa was fantastic. Our server Pedro was super friendly and fast. The fideo soup is killer! We had two little kids with us, and no-one treated us differently. Thus is our new go-to for any trip to Vegas. The carnitas are to die for!!! Worth the drive a little off the beaten path. Don't miss this place, if you are a fan of authentic and delicious mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"Love me some Lindo!  Always great food and excellent views of the city.  Great place to take newbies and/or visitors- the table-side gauc is bomb.com.  They serve this tasty Spanish soup before every entree and I just can't get enough of it.  The margaritas are good but nothing too special.   5 stars because I simply love the view, enjoy the food, and the service is always good!"}
{"text":"We eat here about once a week. They are always great all around. Great food, great service, fun atmposphere,good value! They also have a great view of the strip!"}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I ate there for the first time last night. First of all the view of the city is beautiful! The restaurant was well kept and the service was great! They had multiple people walking around filling our drinks and asking if we needed anything. The food was also pretty great! We ordered the carne Asada and shrimp tacos they were filled with a lot of meat. Our daughter ate the pollito (fried chicken and fries) from the kids menu and surprisingly she ate it all! She's pretty picky when it comes to food so this was a pleasant surprise. My husband and I also ordered a michealada which was also delicious. Overall, we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I can't say that this place offers \"authentic\" Mexican food as it reminds me of El Torito and/or Acapulco's.  But, for the general public, I guess, its as authentic as you're gonna get on the West Side.  The menu is pretty expansive, so take a minute to peruse...I chose the Chile Verde Burrito, and it was very good.  Spicy, but good.  Big enough to give me left overs for the following day, too.  My hubby ordered the Carne Asada Torta - as did my uncle - and my aunt got the fajitas.  Pretty expensive, but they picked up the check, so all good.  Probably will go back to taste other things on the menu - but it will have to wait for a pay week!"}
{"text":"*APOLOGIES FOR LIMITED NUMBER OF PICS*  I love love this place! I've been here over three times, and I cannot say enough wonderful things about this place. I'm a vegetarian so the food choices are limited.  The decor is very cute, totally looks authentic and the hostess have typical dressing on.  They always provide chips salsa and bean dip before the meal along with a small noodle soup which is extremely delicious! I completely recommend you get the large guacamole which they prepare in your table, it's amazing.   Since I'm a vegetarian I always stick to either cheese enchiladas or burrito with no mean but other than that they'll be able to accommodate for you if you ask.  Birthday are great to spend there that sing for you and give you a free tequila shot! Most definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"One of my all-time favorite places! Great food with a great view of the city!"}
{"text":"I go here 3 times during the year on one of my cheat days and what I like is that the food is always consistent. I order new things every time I go and never had a bad meal. The only reason that I gave them five stars is that the food does not blow me away. It's good but not great. What is great is the service. My drinks are never empty and it's service with a smile. I'm a big fried ice cream fan and they have the best in Vegas. Nice environment to take family out to dinner or guest from out of town to see the nice view of Vegas. In my opinion the best Mexican food in Vegas. If you know of a better one let me know so I can try it. Thanks"}
{"text":"IMO best Mexican food in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The first bad sign was the parking situation. There is a small lot which is simply not enough parking to accommodate the restaurant. Most people had parked on the street. I was lucky enough to circle the lot a few times and find a spot.   We arrived at around 5pm on Saturday night. For our table (2 people) we were told the wait time would be 20-25 minutes. Right around 25 minutes our table was ready.   We were served the complimentary chips with salsa and bean dip. Salsa had a good kick to it. The bean dip was served warm and was a little bland in my opinion.   I ordered the veggie fajitas. The veggies were served on a sizzling platter. It seemed that there were more onions than any other vegetables.   The homemade flour tortillas were phenomenal. While the meal was only served with two the server offered us more.   Service was good. Our server was super attentive and friendly.   All in all the food was OK, not sure if it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service here. Me and my dad go here alot. And I must say their guacamole is made fresh right in front of you! So delicious. Also id like to add the flan was the best flan ive ever had. This is an amazing place with live music and friendly vibes"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Come every single time I'm in Vegas, food is good, prices are good, service is always great. One of my favorite mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"In the past 20 years we ate here so many times, lunch, dinner, we did all! Tried almost everything from the menu! Never been disappointed! From hostess to servers, all very friendly! No matter how busy the place, seating and service is always fast!  Lately we are eating lunch here! Their specials are worth driving from West to East! Prices are very reasonable. The food quality is good. They are very helpful to explain the menu items. I'm not from that region, so I always have questions! They don't mind making changes to the orders, if I'm asking for it. For example if I don't like something very spicy, they are willing to prepare the meal for me the way I like it! They make everything right! I love their Shrimp Fajitas. Very tasty! Love, love, love their homemade tortillas! Always fresh!!! My latest addiction is their Mango cake. So refreshing! Of course the Margarita is a must, especially with premium tequila! So you can SAVE water!!! The restaurant has a very welcoming atmosphere with beautiful, authentic decorations. Live music is always entertaining!"}
{"text":"We often go eat here as it's close to home, the food and service are fantastic and the margaritas are great too, They have a great view if the strip too great for bringing out of town guests."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant from the yelp app my honey and I are staying here in Las Vegas for the weekend and you will not be disappointed coming here! I really enjoyed the Chilaquiles!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here based on an article we read of \"20 places everyone who lives in Las Vegas should eat.\" I agree with the article. We kept it simple, we split a shrimp ceviche and I had huevos con chorizo and my wife had a shrimp verde dish. The food was top notch, some of the best huevos con chorizo I've had... and the service was impeccable. My wife had never had a Michelada before and really enjoyed it. I would definitely suggest this place, and come back here again myself."}
{"text":"Best meal we had while in Vegas for a weekend. I lived in Vegas in the 90's and used to frequent this resturaunt for the flavors. Places usually are not as good as you remember, this is the exception. Guacamole was better than we we get at home and the Steak Ranchero had better flavor than I remembered. They cook the steaks a little on the rear side, so watch for that when ordering."}
{"text":"Came here with my bf...best mexican style restaurant food yet in vegas. We got seated right away. We got our food right away and our cups stayed full!..great service + great food = happy customer..definetely coming back!..strongly recommended."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants! You can't beat the service here. Whenever your drink is empty, there is always someone coming along to fill your glass. The food here is delicious.The ensalata marinara is probably my favorite salad here. The avocados and shrimp in it are a very fresh combination. Gallo Al Mojo De Ajo is a great dish for all garlic lovers. Definitely try the fried ice cream, but get it to share with someone, the portion is very large. They have a large variety of flavored margaritas which are great!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today based off of Yelp reviews. Excellent restaurant.  From the time you walk in, you are immediately met by a very friendly staff and a very cool interior.  Not only do you get some really good chips and salsa but also then some fresh made refried beans to dip the chips into.  YUM.  Then, while deciding from their amazing menu they also bring out a small cup of some very good fideo soup.  YUM YUM. The waiter was very friendly and attentive to our \"special requests\" and made some great suggestions. I will admit, I was hungry and I was a pig!  I ordered combo #1 with a taco, chile relleno and a cheese enchilada and all were really good.  The relleno was one of the best I have had and I have eaten a lot of Mexican food.  My wife had the \"Gallo al Conac\" and it was simply amazing, not the normal Mexican fare with more of a white cream sauce.  She loved it. This will be a new must stop restaurant for us whenever we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and were told 20-25 minutes. It has now been 55 minutes and there are still 4 people in front of us. We never would have stayed this long if we knew the true wait time."}
{"text":"Oh Nevada and their lack of Mexican food. We had to travel so much to get here but it was well worth it.  The reception for my grandparent's vow renewal was held in this beautiful restaurant. I really enjoyed the view of Nevada as we sat next to the huge windows and the service was A-OK.  I ordered some shrimp in a sauce of green roasted chili. It was very delicious! I sampled a few other plates as well. I tried the Camarones a la Diabla and they were not spicy at all. It was a disappointment. If you want spicy shrimp these are not it. I also sampled the Ensalada Marinera (Marine Salad) and boy oh boy! I wish I wouldve gotten this instead. It was very delicious and filling! Next time I am ordering one of those bad boys.  The red rice was alright, nothing compared to home-made, and the fried beans taste like canned beans. Sorry. However, those two didnt damp the mood for the rest of this wonderful restaurant. Their torillas were hand-made, their chips and salsa were divine and their fideo soup was delish!  I would definitely visit this place again but I dont think I will, it's too far from the strip."}
{"text":"I've tried and tried numerous times to really like this place.. I will say the margaritas are delicious, but they better be at $10-$11 a piece. We normally like to sit at the bar as we are very casual people. However, when I can see and hear the hostess clipping her nails from where I'm sitting, it's pretty disgusting! I hope to God one of those didn't fly into my food! We ordered the fresh guacamole that they make table side. This is the third time I've ordered this.. I know they have all the ingredients placed in front of you, but I swear it tastes very much like a ton of green pepper, which I very much dislike.. keep in mind I've eaten guacamole about 95 other times with no issues.. so after the guac, salsa, and chips we weren't super hungry and opted for the queso with sausage. ICK!! I had to sop up the grease with a napkin. And this was no queso I'd ever had it was basically a melted brick cheese..  on previous visits we have ordered combo meals and have been less than impressed. If I were to go back here, it would be for drinks with only..and you're buying!!"}
{"text":"Traveled from Phoenix Arizona and let me say it's worth the drive even though started off with waiting after being seated for 25 minutes for our drinks and any service and the assigned waiter kept just Passing our table by !!! Due to his focus was ONLY on a huge party in the center which was fine but I'm still wanting some service , so I went to complain about my service and let me tell you the manager (didn't get his name ) was an ANGEL !!!!  right away we had service and so much attention he even covered out plates and drinks OMG!!! So once again this place is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! I got the chicken with rajas y crema meal let me say took me back to my nanas table !!! Authentic!!!! I will be returning !!!! THANK YOU FOR SUCH WONDERFUL SERVICE!!! And also food was A++++!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. We were greeted in the front door while fresh tortillas were prepared right on the entrance. The service was great and the food was good. I had chilaquiles and they were delicious! The fresh coffee was nice. We proceeded to go to the bar area after breakfast and had margaritas! I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  The food is amazing and I love the drink selection.  I see people stating how the food is pricey.....totally not....it is great food and big portions.  I work on the strip so the quality and price are amazing and worth it.  It is a restaurant people...not Robertos.....the most expensive dish is 19.50."}
{"text":"Homemade torrillas the beans are homemade. The staff is fast, courdeous, and so nice the best service in a while I have had. The plates are huge drinks are great the seating is a lil tight but overall there service is awesome."}
{"text":"I was just driving looking for a place to have dinner and we came across London Michoac√°n.. Great menu so much to choose from and the service was very friendly! They sing and celebrate birthdays for all! I wouldn't mind going back for another one of their drink specials!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely THE best Mexican restaurant on earth! We shared between 4 friends. Carnitas, Beef Fajitas, and Bacon shrimp fajitas!Home made tortillas...soooo good!  It was pure bliss with a side order of fresh guacamole they made table side!! If you go to Vegas... a must stop!! Margaritas to wash it all down! :)"}
{"text":"I'm from Cali I was in Vegas for the weekend and wanted some Mexican food I asked my cousin she reccomended this place so we took off it was about a 10minute drive from our hotel we get there and there is a big parking lot it was not full so I thought it would be a bad place the place started getting packed ppl where coming in left and right good thing we got there early after we go in and get greeted by some girls in some Mexican wear really nice they sit us down and then our waiter comes ask us for our drink then takes our food order. My wife asked for puntas de filets de alba√±il its steak with onions tomatoes and jalape√±os I had a hangover and ordered me a menudo. Before the food arrived they bring you chips and salsa and some bean . also with your order you get a fideo soup really good. The food had an authentic Michoacan flavor I know because my dad is married to a lady from over there. Food was good and the restaurant it self is like being in Mexico  I liked it and I will go back when I'm in Vegas again."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and I couldn''t believe how big this place is... The parking lot was packed and cars were parking on the street.... I thought it was going to be a long wait but to my surprise we were seated right away. The frozen margarita was perfect like my favorite restaurant in Cozumel except I wasn't looking at the sea but the beautiful Las Vegas strip. The guacamole was made tableside and the waiter Angel made it 1/2 spicy to please our friends and 1/2 not for us. It was delicious. Our meals were also good. A lot of food so next time I will order a smaller portion. It has a party atmosphere and is not the place for a quiet dinner. This may just be our new Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican food I'd recommend going here at least once. The food is delicious although priced a little high in my opinion. When I went they had a love mariachi band playing which added to the ambience. This won't be a regular spot for me, but definitely here and there when I'm craving some yummy shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"Service and food were above and beyond what I expected. This is now my favorite Lindo Michoacan location.   The guacamole here is great. They have a certain way of doing it but you can feel free to make a suggestion about certain ingredients to cater to your liking. i let them do their thing and it never disappoints.  The food was great, we had a Chile Relleno/ Tamale combo. The Chile Relleno was really good. The pepper was cooked just right, nice and tender but not mushy. The stuffing in the Chile was delicious. The Tamale was great a beef tamale and I could just sit there and eat that all night.  We also ordered a Gallo al Mojo de Ajo. It was a chicken breast cooked in a garlic wine sauce. I cut up that chicken, tossed it in a flour tortilla with the rice, beans, and guacamole and I was happy. Also ordered a Tamale with that, I think that is going to be a permanent a la carte order from now on.  Up next was the Banderillas de Torro. Grilled Beef skewers with onion and green, red, and yellow peppers. A little tough on the meat but tons of flavor. Good stuff.  Service is half of the experience for me. I can go somewhere with excellent food but if the service is lacking it's ruined or I can go somewhere where the food is OK but as long as the service is great, I will have a good experience. This place is a no brainer if you're in the mood for good Mexican food and excellent service."}
{"text":"FIRST, its authentic and original...has been here in that location since i can remember... the service is awesome and the atmosphere is quite festive with the decor and the mariachi's moving around the room...  its a large menu, so everything is not awesome but overall.... my meals and experiences there have always been acceptable...i just love the service!   my only suggestion to lindo...please learn what a REAL michelada is... pouring clamato juice in a jar and adding spices is something my four year old can do!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times. The food is always good and the view of the strip is amazing. Can't go wrong with Mexican food and margaritas. So good."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Good food.  Very satisfied with our visit. Chips were replaced promptly as well as drinks.  We had more than one server.  Definitely a place to come and enjoy."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving some mexicans while in Vegas, I go to Lindo. Satisfies everytime.  End a nice meal here with their ice cream flamb√©. A must-try.  I do however must mention that the Henderson Lindo has a better location..."}
{"text":"When asked about a good Mexican restaurant in town, our friend immediately recommended the original Lindo Michoacan. He sited it as authentic and the most noted in Vegas.   We enjoyed the atmosphere and wide variety on the menu. We were thrilled to learn it was happy hour (at 3pm), margaritas and beer were only half price, and that the lunch menu was still going.   Half the menu had English translations and half did not but our server was very good at explaining the unique parts of each dish and we had a hard time deciding!  We appreciated that the flavors were rich and dishes somewhat unique from other Mexican popular restaurants. I felt like something fresh so ordered the fish tacos (unoriginal, I know). The fish was high quality, grilled (I had the choice of that or fried), and very juicy! The sauces were also yummy and different than others I've had.  My friends got the Pescado Ajillo (garlic fish) and Beef in Chili Sauce and found both to be unique. The garlic in the fish sauce was a little burnt tasting. The beef was lean and served in hearty portion.  The margaritas we tried were delicious and my friend really enjoyed the spicy rim on his michelada! Another best were the fresh, hot, handmade corn tortillas we were served straight from the oven!  Our bill for 3 people for hearty lunch and drinks was $50 and we were happy with the quality and taste."}
{"text":"In February of this year, a large group of family and myself headed to Las Vegas for my wedding! Good friends of ours had recommended this place, so we went ahead and made reservations. They picked us up in 2 shuttles from the chapel and drove us there. We were received with nothing but smiles and had an entire section just for us. The food was great! the service was the best! and they even drove us back to the hotel!   I definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"After watching \"Heat Seekers\" on the Food Network, I decided to try the Cry Today, Cry Tomorrow chicken.  Before I ordered, the manager gave me a taste of what I would be in for!  This was impossibly HOT and could not be eaten and this was only about an eighth of a teaspoon,  I had to run into the kitchen to ask for milk to kill the burn.  I had already ordered an appetizer and a pork dish but lost my appetite do to the fire within and had to cancel my order, unfortunately.  I would rate it 5 stars for service and atmosphere, but I really didn't eat.  There is a big selection of tequilas and mezcals if you wish to imbibe. Special thanks to Jamie, my waiter for being accommodating while I was on fire!!"}
{"text":"Love this place as well, its got a really fancy interior and it is designed like a real cantina.  The food is also exceptional there.  But Bonito (reviewed earlier) seems to have more earthy and home style food.  Have never had a bad meal at either place.  I had the ceviche here once and it was divine!  FRESH, marinated with citrus and melt in your mouth to die for delicious.  The refried beans at the other Michoacan (Bonito) is better but this is still a fantastic place.  Don't limit yourself in Vegas to eating only on the strip.  There are a ton of really great places to eat at."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. Out of the way from the strip but definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurant to go to.  I've been here a few times, service are fast.  Friendly employees. Last sunday I was here, it was very busy.  The food was great.  I ordered carne asada tacos this time.  Love it.  I would also reccomend the beef fajitas and deep fried snapper which i ordered before.  I really enjoyed my mango margarita.  The location of this restaurant has amazing view to the Las vegas strip. I would reccomend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Beyond excellent!!!! Noe was a awesome waiter, queso fundido was excellent, my carne asada out of this world, portions are just fine and the service is just Perfect!!! Will make this top of my list for Mexican Food (and I know Mexican) in Vegas!! Thank you guys....."}
{"text":"Good service very bland food. Almost tasteless and over priced. Save your money. Better restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican food.  To start off with they give you chips, salsa, and a bean dip. I loved it.  Next, I told the server I had a bad hangover and he brought over a very tasty Bloody Mary.  He then brought out a little broth in some little bowls. It was so good! I noticed they give it out to the children who visit, but I have to say it cured my hangover!  The breakfast with eggs and shredded beef was so good!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing and authentic. Next level, not your average Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very cute and the view of the strip is amazing.  The food was just ok. If the place did not have the atmosphere I would not return. The service was just ok. We were greeted by the hostess but she did not smile once seating us. The first waiter we had Jesus was really nice. There was a moment of confusion for us though because I guess there was a shift change and we were not told so we didn't know who to ask for the check from and a to go box. Maybe this should be a service standard implemented?"}
{"text":"Food & Service is Fabulous. We were staying at a casino & this place was recommended. Great portions. Atmosphere is authentic. Coming back here next time in Vegas"}
{"text":"The customer service & food was just great. Their tortilla chips, beans, and salsa were good.   You definitely have to try their shrimp ceviche & Mojarra(tilapia) delicious. Will definitely be coming back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since I was little. It was my mother's and step father's favortie mexican restaurant and over time has become mine. Everything on the menu is great but what has been my favorite all these years is the mole poblano. Everyone is always nice and the owner has never forgotten us and always takes time to say hi. To me this is the best mexican restaurant in vegas and even though they have multiple locations nothing beats the original. However make sure you are prepared to wait because from the time it opens to the time it closes this place is busy and something that has been that busy all these years has to be good."}
{"text":"Such amazing service. Ordered the fresh table-side guacamole and the shrimp fajitas.   Our waiter was very attentive and came within 5 minutes of us ordering to make our table-side guacamole. They asked how much of the mix-ins to make our guacamole exactly the way we wanted. The guacamole tasted so fresh and had such little ingredients. All together, they used avocado, diced tomatoes, onions, cilantro and jalapeno; as well as dashes of salt and pepper and a squeeze of half a lime.  The shrimp fajitas came out very quickly as well. We asked for both flour and corn tortillas and it was not a problem. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here once a month as a treat.  I love the authentic Mexican cuisine this place offers.  Everything is fresh when it comes out from the kitchen.  We have never waited long for our food.  Great service and great prices.  You get a lot of food for what you pay for which is worth it.  The Chile Relleno is fantastic."}
{"text":"This restaurant probably served me the worst steak picado I have ever eaten in my life, and I have tried this plate at a lot of establishments. The steak chucks were hard, and were super tough to chew. The meat seemed old, and if not old then just cheap and tough. The sauce that the meat was cooked in was rather bland and flavorless. I had to ask for their extra spicy sauce in order to add some \"pizzaz\" to the food. The soup appetizer that came with the meal was pretty good though, so I give them some credit for that. If it wasn't for the soup this place would get 1 star vs. the 2 stars that I am giving them for this experience.   The menu seems to be more tailored to the tourists and is not the traditional Michoacan dishes that I have eaten at other places. For someone who isn't up on what \"real\" Mexican food should taste like, they may like it here, but for me I give this place two thumbs down and a big ol' YUCK!. Never again. This place is totally over rated!"}
{"text":"After living in Las Vegas 21 years can't believe it was last year we found the best Mexican food in Vegas! We enjoy the food and great service, can't wait to go back!  Also enjoy the Henderson location."}
{"text":"Best Ever!!!!! Staff is the Bomb...super friendly. Food is awesome. Great flavor. Love it!! Love it!!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my big burrito I got from here. They know whats up!!! I love the fact that they also serve beans with your nachos. I wish they had a plate with loaded enchiladas not just 2 enchiladas. I'm  a big boy and I love to eat!!! Great view of the strip. Very friendly service haven't played thier games at the bar yet but I just love how everything is decorated and even love how they keep the bathroom cleans. This will be my go to place for real Mexican food."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Wonderful service. We were watching the waitstaff and no one was just standing around. Everyone was pitching in to help no matter whose table it was. The manager Erik was even helping out when something fell on the floor. He grabbed a broom and swept it up right away. Our waiter Luis was amazing and stopped to ask if we needed anything several times even though the restaurant was at capacity everything was smooth sailing. My hats off to management who hires good conscientious people to work there. It pays off. We will go there every time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"The view of the strip is amazing! There are plenty of window side tables but calling in before hand and making a reservation to get one would be a good idea. It does get busy for dinner.  Went around 6pm on a Thursday. Surprisingly it was pretty busy but since there are plenty of tables alongside their huge window, we were still able to get a table with a view of the strip.  I ordered the Ceviche which was decent. My boyfriend ordered chicken fajitas, I was not impressed. Maybe we ordered wrong but from previous reviews I was under the impression that they served authentic Mexican and it was a bit Americanized to my taste.  The service was horrible. We probably only saw our waiter three times: 1.) to take our order 2.) dropped off our food 3.) for the bill. We saw other servers more than we did our own and had to order drinks from the bar because he took to long to check on our drinks.  I liked the ambiance, scenery and view but it was lacking service.  If I return it would be for a happy hour. I would definitely sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Sorry Lindo, but you are overpriced and not very good.   Honestly, this seems to be more of a social spot then a place to get some good Mexican food. The food is meh and the drinks are meh. It has a cute atmosphere and the view of the valley is pretty great so I'll give it that. That's about it though!"}
{"text":"This place is great from top to bottom. The view is incredible, the staff was attentive and personable. The food however is the real star of this restaurant. Some Mexican places over salt everything or put way to much cheese in the dishes to overcompensate for the quality of the food. I have been coming here for years and have only had good experiences with this place. I would recommend it to anyone looking for quality Mexican food in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so bad, but nothing was working in my favor tonight.  Pros: the staff and everybody was so, so nice and we were seated immediately  Cons: EXTREMELY loud, couldn't hold a conversation over the music and other people. Ordered a $14 vegetarian enchilada with \"saut√©ed veggies\" that I'm almost positive were canned- it was not good. Please don't order this. My mom in law got the same thing and agreed it was not good at all/came out of a can. The seating seemed a little cramped with people bumping into my chair and squeezing in between our table and others.  Won't be coming back with so many other good Mexican restaurants in town to choose from."}
{"text":"This place when they first opened was great.  We went here yesterday, and let me start with the hostess sitting us all the way in the back, as if she was trying to hide us in an empty restaurant.  Secondly they brought out the chips and salsa with their bean dip.  The beans tasted so gross.  They tasted burnt.  Anyone who knows the difference in cooking beans, or leaving them out overnight will understand this nasty taste.  We ordered the guacamole they prepare at the table, and started to explain to the server.  When we told him about the beans, he stood there and argued with 3 Hispanic women that the beans were fine, not burnt that that's how they are suppose to taste.   GROSS!!!!  We told him no.  No amount of salt would fix this.  He had an attitude that we did not deserve.   We proceeded to order our entrees at this point I was ready to leave sick of his attitude. However Out of town company was here so we tried to make the most of it.  The food came and was lacking flavor the chicken was dry.  The milanesa was tough.  We left, and said this place has gone down hill.  Either they changed cooks or sold the business.  No more Lindo in my families future.  This is sad because I have booked parties in the past, and was never put off by the food like Thursday 4/20/17."}
{"text":"There is not a meal that I have not enjoyed here.  With so many reviews and top-notch ratings already, let me just suggest the lengua or the carnitas.  But like I said, everything is good here!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times thus far and had 2 good experiences. On my most recent visit, I went with my kids on my birthday/Mother's Day. I had a migraine so I slept most of the day. We stumbled in at closing time. My son explained it was my birthday as well as Mother's Day and that I had been sick all day. We were the only people in the restaurant so that was nice. I've been there with a migraine in the past when they had live music and it was torture.   Our waiter was attentive and patient although it was obvious it had been a long day for him. I had a margarita-frozen which was just okay. We had this appetizer that I crave. I forget the name. Basically it looks like a shrimp burrito. It's fantastic. My daughter got a child's plate with a quesadilla and rice and beans. I got a combo plate with cheese enchilada, tostada and taco (I hate shredded beef) and rice and beans. My son got a #13 Combo with a burrito and enchilada which he promptly doused then bathed in ghost peppers and habanero sauces to the the shock and awe of the staff. They inquired as to his need of water or milk which he declined. Ghost peppers aren't hot enough for him. At this point, I think he would delight in chemical burns. He has a vast array of hot sauces at home.   Our food was tasty and satisfying. I asked for cherry cheesecake for desert and they told me they were out. Then they found some squirreled away and made my day. The next thing I know, they bring out a sombrero, churro desert and a shot of tequila along with 3 free hot pink Mother's Day T-Shirts! They sing Happy Birthday Panchita and my son got the entire humiliating scenario on camera. The tequila was very smooth, I gotta get me somma that! It's Giro. Smoother even than Patron!   It was a nice birthday/Mother's Day that my kids and I will always cherish. We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I have been in the city for a long time and this is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant. When I walked in this restaurant 22 years ago and saw a lady making fresh tortillas I knew this was the one. I have eaten alot of things on the menu and I have been very satisfied with most. I really enjoy the shrimp dishes"}
{"text":"Great place. Love the size, the decor and the food.  You are greeted and sat when you walk in and attended to by many people who keep your glass full and your special requests coming.    I had the chicken mole and it was delicious.  The mole was not too spicy and the perfect amount for the plate of food.  The Coca Cola carnitas was so delicious. The meat was not dry and the sauce was exquisite. The portions size is large, so be hungry.    The iced tea was delicious.  Thanks for making a great brewed tea.   I would love to go back and try another dish.  I wish I had dessert after I saw the photos of what they had.    Only flaw; the temperature!  It is a little too warm in there for my liking."}
{"text":"Dined here Oct 14 2017  Arrived just after 5pm and there were already many others dining. Service was outstanding - starting with the greeters at the door who made us sincerely feel welcomed ..  Very extensive menu - having never been needed extra time to read through.   Chips, salsa (very spicy!) and a bean dip to munch while deciding what to order. La Buenona Margarita was very good - Husb had a Pacifico draft. Dinner was absolutely delicious!  Fideo Soup came first.  I had (7) Jumgo Gulf Shrimp in garlic  - without any guajillo peppers as I cannot tolerate spice - just the right serving of rice, beans and guacamole on the plate along with 3 fresh tortillas.   Husb had Chili Verde and gave it two thumbs up as well. Atmosphere is lively, but no obnoxiously loud so that we couldn't hear our conversation ..  Several TV's displayed sports. Bar had numerous patrons dining, watching sports and playing video (poker probably but didn't look) Overall a great find and we will return."}
{"text":"I been here twice and both times I was pleased. The service was great. It's a authentic Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant!   Everyone that we came into contact with was gracious and friendly.    Upon our arrival the manager opened the door with a big smile and welcomed us into the restaurant. We were seated right away adjacent to the massive picture windows.   The view is as amazing as others have described.  The whole Las Vegas valley lies in front of you like a picture postcard. I'm sure that it's mind blowing at night,  but even during the day it's spectacular.   The service was impeccable: Professional, friendly, quick. The staff was always available with more chips and salsa, drinks,  napkins--whatever we needed.   The food was well presented,  very hot and delicious. Everything tasted as if it was prepared in house. For sure the tortillas were, because they make them right in front of you at the entrance to the place.   The menu variety is large and we can't wait to return to try more delicious and original dishes.   We couldn't have asked for more. This place was the perfect example of what a restaurant should be.   Hats off to Erik and all of his crew!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican Restaurants! Super authentic with hand made tortillas and the food is amazing!! Chili Rellenos being one of my favorite on the Menu!!!"}
{"text":"I tried the summerlin and the henderson location within a few weeks of each other. They are both nice but henderson appears to be their flagship. So will comment about my henderson experience. Again I ordered the Carne asada burrito and a pepsi. I like to try staples to guide the quality of the meat etc. To start they give you some tasty bean dip and salsa and chips. The burrito itself required an up sell for rice and beans. I mean come on dude just add it in automatic. A burrito that only comes with meat and Pico de gaillo...eh a bit stingy..anyways the cuts of meat were very good and the burrito was good..however the place itself is a 10 and the ambiance and views are a worth whatever they charge which was within reason. .bottomless pepsi and my tummy was a happy camper..customer service was excellent...deducted one star for the nickel and diming on the beans and rice..I think it would better to just say it's 11.95 including beans and rice..if it had been so I would have given 5 stars so let's call this 4.5 stars for a minor annoyance...will return for sure :)"}
{"text":"we braved the cinco de mayo crowd and still had a fantastic time. mariachi band awesome The lindo michoacan Cadillac margarita tasty I had 2.¬† The tableside guac always yum yum yummy, Dad enjoyed the carne asada taco combo, and I loved the camarones con raja y crema estilo stephania platter with corn tortillas. only downside it was hot inside not enough a.c. for the amount of people and the noise level"}
{"text":"What a joke. Used to be good. Got here before 5 for their lunch specials, had to use the restroom that they were cleaning. By the time I ordered it was after 5. So they said I couldn't order from the lunch menu at 5:07."}
{"text":"I'm telling you, their guacamole is the best thing I have ever tasted. They make it fresh right in front of you at your table when you order it (I think it's a side dish; not the one that comes with the meals) and it is so so so yummy! They're dishes are great, and the complimentary chips and dips that come before the meal are so good; I almost got full before even getting my meal. The staff is friendly and they even have live music playing at night.   A little side note; parking on weekends get crazy so get there early or eat here on the weekdays!"}
{"text":"I been to this restaurant twice, found it by mistake and will be returning every time I'm in Las Vegas. Try the guacamole it's made right in front of you, they also have a drink menu and the prices are fair. Best view of the Vegas skyline!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome..Locals told us about this place a few years ago and we always make it a stopping point whenever we go to Vegas(like in 3 hours:-)..They even have video poker if you want to gamble..The buffet on Sat/Sun morning is awesome..If you like/love Mexican food, you definitely want to stop here...Very easy to find....Pete"}
{"text":"It's our own fault for trying it but my son was in town and we had to dare each other to try the Food Network Special. It's called \"Cry Today, Cry Tomorrow\". It does not misrepresent the fact it is super hot, which it is but there is absolutely no flavor to the meal at all. If you're going to call attention to something, at least make an attempt at adding flavor to the heat. Tried the Chile Colorado at the Original location yesterday for lunch and again it was just bland, No flavor. I added my rice and beans to it so it had some flavor. Not impressed. There has got to be better nearby."}
{"text":"Best Authentic Mexican food in Vegas enjoy everything in the menu great service too!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this food is not good. The ambiance is great. The view is one of a kind. But the food is gross. Steak Picado tasted like old man's breath. Carnitas had died in the pot. Dry, dry, dry. They turn tables off their reputation which is long past due for an overhaul. Worst of all, a lot of people are there for a special occasion. I thought they were being taken advantage of for the price of the meals. Check out the taco shops in town instead. You'll save a fortune."}
{"text":"The food here was decent. The service was friendly. The soda was Pepsi (booo). Not a revelation in Mexican food, but decent for what it was."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations from the friendly and swift/hard working staff to the beautiful and original Mexican decorations! The staff was great from Daniel who was our waiter to Miguel who made sure we were all very well taken care of! Thank you thank you so much! The food was amazing and the cocktails were refreshing and delicious! We will definitely be returning when we come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great service! I appreciate the attention given to us by the staff. It was a little dark in there (ambiance), but the waiter and manager gave us flashlights so we can read the menu. Everything came out quickly - chips and dip and water came out within a couple minutes of our being seated. Started off wih the Rigo Margarita. I'm a lightweight when it comes to drinking, so that got me tipsy in a few minutes. The menu had a good selection of dishes - not your typical Mexican restaurant menu.  I settled on the Torta de Pierna (Roast Pork Mexican Sandwich), served with a heaping helping of french fries -  the first time I've seen french fries in a Mexican restaurant! I ate everything on the plate. Lol, the busboy even commented that I almost ate the plate! Good sandwich. Veruka ordered the Beef Chimichanga. She only ate half then said she was full - geez, I can't take this chick anywhere! ;-)  At some point in time,  I want to come back to try the other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Sorry but this isn't Mexican food. This is Tex mex at best. After living in Socal for 8 years I grew accustomed to authentic Mexican food, and this is definitely not it.  The location is pretty amazing though."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  Made reservations since it was a birthday dinner, and when we arrived they said it would be a little bit of a wait.  After 30 mins, we inquired and we were told it was just a little bit more of a wait....\"a little bit\" turned out to be an hour and 10 mins... When we inquired with the girl at the door, she couldn't even remember our names, who we were..etc.. so much for having reservations!  Left... hungry and upset...."}
{"text":"Over priced food had absolutely no flavor. Do not waste your money or your time.  Sad to say this place was a disappointment. Do not waste your money or time. How they are always busy it's unbelievable."}
{"text":"We recently visited this restaurant for my cousin's rehearsal dinner, and overall, we had a wonderful time.  The staff was very accommodating to our party of 30, giving us a side room with an exquisite night view of the valley.  Several servers waited on us hand and foot, keeping drinks topped off and the salsa and chips full.  The restaurant was very busy, with a pleasant noisiness that complemented the fellow singing and playing the guitar.    For the appetizer, we had sopa de fideo, and fresh guacamole with a really nice kick... good, clean, fresh jalape√±o spice on this one (perfect for El Gigante Picante Del Monte!)  For the main course, I enjoyed a New York strip, cooked rare... just how I like it.  Thick and juicy, with nice Mexican sides of rice and freshly prepared beans.  Washed it all down with a cold Pacifico, and I was doing great.  My bride enjoyed the chicken enchiladas, and I stole a bite-- very fresh and flavorful.  Everything seems to be prepared in the restaurant, not bought in a big can and warmed up in the back.  Parking on a busy night is a tough proposition in the parking lot-- best bet is to find a street spot and walk in.  Speaking of walking in, I would recommend making a reservation, as the place was packed, even when we left.  If you find yourself in Hendo or just want to take a bit of a drive away from the strip on your next Vegas adventure, this spot is worth a try."}
{"text":"The view alone was worth the visit. Happened to be during a rain storm so there was crazy lightning across the skyline and you could see everything through the windows. Plus the lights of the strip. I had the chicken fajitas and they were yummy. I'd go again"}
{"text":"I went here because I wanted Mexican eats after my haircut east of the strip.  This restaurant has won the best of Las Vegas award for best Mexican restaurant in town numerous years (it's advertised proudly on their entrance).  Sweet, looks like a winner.  Friendly servers, large restaurant, lots of employees so you're never without.  (I think there was a separate beverage guy and chips/salsa guy).  They start you off with a soup of some sort.  Good but rather simple.  Chips were good, salsa not hot, bean dip meh.  Wife had the standby chimichanga, and she was pleased.  Carnitas were good.  My kid's beef taco was nothing more than a shell and beef (not ground).  No lettuce, cheese, nothing.  My kid was okay with that though, but I thought it was strange.  My other daughter's chicken burrito was just as dry and boring as well.  Prices were a little steep, but it was pretty busy (no wait though), and based on the awards they got I would charge more too.  It's a safe bet for Mexican sit-down (nice booths, friendly staff, even a singer), especially for non-Spanish speakers and families.  If you're willing to gamble, there surely must be better hole-in-the-wall types of places around."}
{"text":"We love the food here. After living in So. Cal for 38 years, we are really picky about our Mexican food. This is the first place in the Vegas area that we consider \"real\" Mexican food. We eat here on a regular basis and love it!!"}
{"text":"Way to go Lindo! Great service even when they are SLAMMED! Claudio (server) and Roarigo (busser) both very nice and fun made such a fantastic team. Also made a great impression on my unlce for his birthday, he thanks you as well. :) I would be a PROUD manager/owner if I had you two!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yesss! We came in on a Saturday night around 8pm it was really busy but we were seated within 10min. The food was delicious and their drinks were strong but still super tasty! The service was wonderful from the hostess to the waiter and busser- all were pleasant, attentive, and prompt. Our night was so much funner than expected. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Being Mexican, my family and I always desire \"homemade\" Mexican food, specifically a place with fresh authentic beans. Coming from southern California we have pretty high standards when it comes to Mexican food. Lindo Michoac√°n did not disappoint! Some of the best Mexican, if not the best Mexican food I have tried in Las Vegas! I made reservation for Saturday night at 7 pm. And when my family and I arrived the place was packed! As we waited for our table there was a live mariachi band for entertainment. We did not have to wait long to be seated, where our drink order was taken and chips salsa and, bean dip were placed on the table as an appetizer. Yum! Salsa was delicious and had a bit of heat and great chili flavor. The bean dip was my favorite, like I said you know a Mexican place is good if they make good beans! The chips were delicious as well and obviously homemade. Service was friendly and prompt, even in the midst of a rush hour. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito wet, it was a generous portion and was very delicious. The wet sauce was tomato based which was delicious, however next time I will request the diablo sauce, which is more of an enchilada type sauce. My whole family enjoyed their dinner plates and all of the food looked delicious to me. I can't wait to try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"Always have a great experience while I'm here! Food is good, service is friendly. The food arrival timing is good and they don't try to rush you out when trying to enjoy yourself! Can't forget the beautiful view!"}
{"text":"We've been patronizing the original for decades.  This location is closer to our home and provides the same inviting atmosphere and delicous food.  However, I do miss that there is no tortilla creation station as in the original location."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican food restaurants in Vegas!  Flour tortillas made on the premises with the station set up in the dining area so you can watch them if you'd like.  Everything I've ever tried has been very good.  Plenty of parking and they need it because they are always busy when I go.  Huge menu selection."}
{"text":"I was assured this one was so much better than the other one I went to.  Boy, were they wrong.  The same bland Mexican food and salsa still tasted like a can of tomato paste."}
{"text":"Heard great things from the concierge at the hotel I'm staying at.  Extremely disappointed...  The \"hot sauce\" taste like a can of tomato sauce with a packet of McCormick taco spice thrown in it.  The food is so bland it reminded me the \"Mexican food\" I get when I visit my 96 year old grandmother at the waiting to die home.   There are so many better places in Vegas, believe me!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Delicious food.  Friendly promt service. And mariachis. What more could you ask for? Muy bueno!"}
{"text":"I love this place. On my visit last night I had the steak ranchero and it was great. Never disappoints!!! I have had several dishes here and they are always consistent. The staff is always amazing. The manager checks on you to make sure everything is right. I even love the man singing and playing music. Not too many places in Vegas that are great across the board...but this place is close."}
{"text":"We went to the one on E Desert Inn Rd., let me start by saying the food is awesome and the portions are plentiful!  The cheese they use in their food is so good,  the enchiladas were amazing and I'm sure it was the cheese! The chips and salsa are also super good, they give a bean dip along with the salsa which is equally delish!   The only things that  I would complain about are the margaritas and our server. Starting with the server, he was really short with us and very unfriendly. The other staff members were so friendly though, so it wasn't such a problem as it could have been. The margaritas were terrible, they tasted like a glass of sweet and sour, literally the tequila was unnoticeable. With that said, I can handle dinner without a margarita and an unfriendly waiter as long as the food always tastes this yummy!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, good service but awful food!!! If you want to have drinks this is the place to go. I've given this place a try five different times for food and every time I'm more disappointed. The food comes out pretty quick and from the taste I'm pretty sure it's not freshly cooked."}
{"text":"This place was fire! Me, my fianc√©e and baby boy really enjoyed this place. The service was awesome, the food and drinks were great as well. The ambience was cozy and relaxing with music playing not too loud it was perfect. Parking was easy to find couldn't have asked for a better dinner tonight. It's gonna be my go to spot now.   I can't wait to bring my family here!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas we always stop here for dinner and it never disappoints! The service was fantastic! The atmosphere was great! When we went they also had a gentlemen offering live music which enhanced our time there. The food is AMAZING! Also, I would recommend having guacamole they make right in front of you! Probably the best Mexican restaurant I have EVER been to! The margaritas are on point! The pricing is also reasonable.. You get what you pay for. I have nothing negative to say about the time I have spent here."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant near my house Good lunch deals and great service Delicious drinks as well!"}
{"text":"Not sure what happened here.  The chips are too thick & served cold.  The salsa is lackluster.  The table side guacamole was tasteless.  Despite the great view of The Strip and the fantastic array of tequilas, I'm still lookin' for the right combination of food, drink and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  I've enjoyed the Henderson location most.  The E. Desert Inn location is also off.  But the W. Flamingo is just \"not great\".  The taco salad at lunch today was the worst in memory - no flavor - simply thrown together.  Cabbage to fill the lettuce.  Not much tomato.  Not a spec of cilantro or onion.  The chicken was gawd awful.  Service staff was working hard, but without good effect.  From Henderson, I got the impression this group was run by a nice family and had their management chops down.  I'm afraid not.  Alternatives abound."}
{"text":"If only...  All the ingredients are there, but the execution is a bit wanting.  The margaritas are too sweet, compared to their Henderson location and the table-side guacamole is heavy-handed on the salt.  Tweaking the margarita mix and adjusting the portions of jalapenos, onions and salt in the guacamole would make this a \"perfect\" Friday-after-hours hang out - with \"futbol\" on the screen over the bar.  If only..."}
{"text":"AMAZING food!!! We cant wait to go back!!!! The atmosphere was fantasic and the salsa and bean dip........soooooooooo good!!!"}
{"text":"This place was so good I had to use my first ever Yelp review on it. The food took a while to come out but you are so busy enjoying the atmosphere that you simply dont mind. Once the food hit the table I understood completely the wait with everything being fresh. The bussers never let my drink get empty and our server Jesus was extremly atentive. Ive been in the service industy for 10 years now and its been a while since a restaurant has left me talking about it hours after ive walked out the doors but this place was amazing."}
{"text":"Aye Carumba... Gotta try it, but be ready first.  1.  The real deal - This is the real deal of Mexican food my friends. If  you are used to having tacos, nachos, burritos, quesadilla, taco salads, or items from Chipotle and Baja Fresh or Zabas, then don't expect more of the same.  If your idea of good Mexican food is El Jefe, or Chevy's, then just put on a different view point for this place.  2.  It is...- The food here is the real deal and it is very, very tasty.  How many places can to go to order  caldo de res (beef soup)?  Or even the Birria (Goat Stew)? This stuff is authentic.  3.  Parking??? Que Paso - How many restaurants are you aware of in Vegas, where you have to park on the street or across the street because the already large lot is so full of guests?  4. All this means...- This place is a great place. It is real food, so you have to critique it as real food. The salsa is wonderful, the tortilla hand made.    5.  Music and Decor - Be careful going on nights and weekends when they are playing music. It can be a bit loud.  6.  Reservations - The staff is a bit on the non efficient side. Be careful.  And, the place is busy....  Try it, Try real Mexican Food,  Ask the waiter for what is really authentic. You will find it here. By the way, yes it was an italian restaurant in the past, but the place back then was never full and never that good. This place ROCKS."}
{"text":"Fabulous!  Gotta go here.  1.  Ambiance - Great, traditional, can seat large or small parties.  Date, friends, or business, it is great.  2.  Appetizers - the salsa, the home made fresh made tortillas and the bean dip are great and never ending. Just ask for more and there it is.  3.  Food - So good, so much to choose from. If you are eating American style, they have lunch specials with all your popular dishes like Enchiladas, Burritos, Tacos, Taco Salad, and they have more interesting things such as tongue, pork chops and shrimp dishes.  The fish is great, the lunch specials are nice, but my all time favorite is the Caldo de Res.  How many places in NV can  you get this?  It is SOOOOOO GOOOD.  4.  Food part 2.  Forgot about the Menudo, and the tongue.  Lengua a michoacan or tacos de lengua, the beef tongue is great here. You know you gotta have a lot of people coming here to serve the more exotic things.   And, try not to order the burrito, mi amigo. That is like going to a steak restaurant and ordering a PBJ Sandwich. Tasty , but not what you order eating out!  5.  This place may be better than the new on on Carnegie and Horizon Ridge in Henderson.  A must to go."}
{"text":"Great chips and salsa. The lunch menu is pretty good and cheap. Many options to chose from. No waiting to be seated. Nice view. The chimichanga was excellent"}
{"text":"One of the best places you can eat at.  Call ahead and make a reservation though unless you enjoy waiting like the Uruk Hai before a battle on Middle Earth.   I can only vouch for this location tho, which has one of the best panoramic views of the Strip at night."}
{"text":"This was the best Mexican food I've had in years! The homemade flour tortillas are to die for and I love that all dishes come with Fideo soup to start.  I usually order enchiladas at any Mexican place and decided to try their mole enchiladas with Steak. When my plate arrived I couldn't even find the enchiladas because there was a gigantic piece of well seasoned carne asada on top that was so amazing! Needless to say, portions were huge. We got to-go boxes and it felt like we barely touched our food even though we pigged out. The only disappointment were the churros for dessert which were nothing special, just the typical street fair kind and I suggest that they improve on this. All the Fine Mexican restaurants have home made churros on their menu accompanied with dipping sauces. Not so here. A minor detail, but I'll let it slide and will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Vegas. we visit this location every time that come to Vegas the service is very good food very good."}
{"text":"Staff is great, restaurant is great but food is just bland, it's missing flavor. I'm 100% Mexican, so I'm picky about my Mexican food."}
{"text":"Usually a SRO place on Friday night. We found the food to be quite typical TexMex, no zing for the palette. But hey, the view is great."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant with Amazing Mexican food.!  The original is nice but doesn't even compare to this location."}
{"text":"Best Mexican Restaurant!! I have been coming here for years and it's still amazing. The food is always so good. I usually order some shrimp dish..I try too change it up. Beans are amazing and you can tell everything is fresh. Everything I order..not one thing I didn't like. They also have great kids meals too. Friendly staff as well.  I have noticed the prices have gone up but it's well worth! I have been too the one in Henderson and this location seems too be a bit better. So good!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's so fun and the food is delicious. The margaritas are very good and you leave there HAPPY!  We have gone to the location closer to our house in Henderson.  It's also good, but there's always something special about the original!"}
{"text":"Went on date night here last night.. Probably passed by at least 50 times since I've moved to the area over the last year. But honestly, awesome view and romantic.. Amazing food and margaritas & great great service!! Going back after weekend"}
{"text":"I had been craving mexican for days and was pretty excited to come here when i heard how good it was.    i started with a peach strawberry margarita.  yum!  then had some chips, they werent that great but i was hungry so i still ate them.  the salsa wasnt anything special either.  it was all spice.  no flavor, or substance.  i ordered chicken fajitas.  when my plate came out it was about 80% peppers.  there were maybe 4 pieces of onion, and barely any chicken.  i made myself one fajita and then didnt want anymore.  the tortillas werent good either.    maybe new york has me spoiled when it comes to mexican food, but this place was not even close to what i expected."}
{"text":"Last night I asked to eat some where new, which meant *hey babe let's go for Mexican* in his mind. Let's just say it's always on his mind... We parked along side of the uphill road. The parking lot is large, but it looked packed. We were seated at a great table down in the front where there's a beautiful view. I ordered a Pina colada that wasn't up to my standards ( but hey, I'm Puerto Rican and picky ) I had the taco salad and bf ordered tacos. They were both very delicious! I'll be  returning for sure. Great for birthdays and events! Thanks"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing, there is music  and the drinks are very good..The food is alright being Mexican I know it could be better.."}
{"text":"One of the best views in the city. It's located up high in the Henderson hills overlooking the entire valley. Go at night! Their margaritas are always very good. I've tried a few different ones but I'd go with the Patron Perfect Margarita. The chips and salsa are good, nice heat on the salsa! The bean dip is tasty and our son loves the Fideo Soup that comes with the entrees.   My wife got the Toro a la Coca-Cola. It was good but very rich. I ordered the Puntas de filete Albanil which was killer! You need to like some heat because the jalape√±os are fresh but it was great. The New York steak was juicy and the onions perfectly carmalized. I'll have a tough time switching away from that dish! Service is always good too!"}
{"text":"best. mexican. food. EVER! Every time i am in Vegas we make sure to eat here, sometimes we eat here every day..no joke. This place makes my heart melt. I LOVE LINDO!"}
{"text":"A MUST GO! This is by far the best Mexican restaurant We have ever been to and we're from California. All the staff members are AMAZING, which is so rare these days. We had WALTER and CARLOS, they both gave an astounding first impression before we even ordered our food. They created a great atmosphere for not only us but every customer we saw them interact with. Really great personalities which is the main reason we will be coming back to this restaurant besides the amazing food."}
{"text":"What a view! Ask to be seated with a view at sunset it's gorgeous... Service was excellent and food tasted great. If I had to find something wrong it would be the noise level.. But for them that's a good thing because it was busy ass hell!!! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I hate to put a Lindo's down since I am a HUGE fan of all the other locations. But This one.. ehhh not the same.  I was excited when I found out a couple months ago that they opened a location in Henderson so everyone is the area could enjoy such awesome Mexican food, but when it was my turn to try this one out I wasn't so happy.  First off the building use to be a Italian restaurant so it doesn't have the same feeling as the other locations. I like to feel like I'm in Mexico while eating good Mexican food, there is like no atmosphere here. Yes there are great views but it's kinda hard to enjoy when you're back to back with everyone around you. The tables are so jammed in this place I was so uncomfortable.   Next up the orders were so butchered and the service was not the usual standard I am use to at the other Lindo locations. The table side guac never came, there was like no tequila in the margaritas even when we order a double, and the changes to the orders weren't there.  The server was cocky and didn't really help us out when we weren't happy.  I know it was a busy Saturday night but there are some things I don't think are going to change because of the layout of the restaurant. Just not the same. I will stick to the West Flamingo and Desert Inn locations."}
{"text":"A+ for effort. I love the view and the service has always been wonderful. The food is good. I think the food is very good and honestly I've had better Mexican food but they get 5 stars bc they are wonderful for large parties as well as a cozy environment for a simple date night.  You can't go wrong suggesting this for dinner!  I love good service!"}
{"text":"So good I'm posting this review while eating. I'm so stuffed and satisfied. This place is a real gem in this community. Definitely my new spot."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here frequently because it taste great and they serve the food quickly. They have really good salsa too!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible! My personal favorite is their chicken soup and their flan. Best tasting flan I've ever had. Service is great, view is spectacular and the food is very tasty.  I've never been a fan of Mexican food but this is truly a great restaurant and I would recommend it to everyone, as I already do. Lunch specials are also very inexpensive for what u get!! Best Mexican restaurant in Henderson, hands down! ;D"}
{"text":"Very tasty, and the view is excellent! It's a busy place though, so sometimes things are a little slow, but that's to be expected. Otherwise all positives!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I always come here to eat. Hands down the best continual service every time we go. Never have had a single complaint."}
{"text":"I love love this place. It is the best Mexican food I have found in Vegas. Its not like down and dirty San Diego Mexican food but it does the trick.   Love coming on the weekends when they have some live music. Its a 1 man band on his piano, but non the less I love it. Little kids tend to get up and dance the night away. It is a good family place where we can come as a family and mommy can drink margaritas and daiquiris.   They have good lunch specials for around $10 found on the back of the menu. They also have great Fideo soup. The shrimp cocktail is good as well.   I tried the oysters one time and no bueno. I guess i should have known better than to order them at a Mexican restaurant. They skip the fixins like the horshradish, etc and just give you plan ol lime.   The steak dishes are great and beef tacos are the bomb diggity. And of course rice and beans with everything!  Make sure to grab a sucker on the way out cause they are the best."}
{"text":"Loud, difficult to converse even early evening  (5ish). View was lovely but food was only mediocre. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food I can remember having.  Everything tasted like it came from a can.  Wife and I came here a few months ago for lunch and we both were horribly disappointed.  The verde sauce tastes like the stuff that comes in a can in the Mexican food section of the supermarket.  Margaritas tasted old and tired -- Tasted like the sour mix came from a can or powder.  Nothing fresh and all terribly bland.  View was pretty good, but didn't compensate for the awful food.  Waitstaff did some corny Mariachi birthday thing for a table nearby.  I felt bad for both the staff and the birthday table.  Serving staff did try pretty hard though.  If it wasn't for the decent service (in spite of the corny Mariachi routine) we'd have given it one star.  It's not like we got sick or anything, but it was so bland and canned tasting that I can honestly say I've had better Mexican food from a TV dinner out of the frozen food section of the supermarket.  We couldn't believe that this place got voted \"Best Mexican Food in Vegas\" or some such thing.  What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Hola ayer 5-10-17 fuimos a comer con mi familia al lindo Michoac√°n pero fue una gran decepci√≥n porque la comida est√° muy mala y los meseros atienden mejor a los americanos que los hispanos. El due√±o deber√≠a poner m√°s atenci√≥n a su negocio y no dejar que los trabajadores lo hagan perder clientes yo personalmente he recomendado ha americanos al lindo Michoac√°n pero ayer d√≠a de las madres fue una total decepci√≥n haber comido ah√≠."}
{"text":"Food was great. Each time I'm in town, it's a must to stop and eat! Only things I'd like to see changed is the flavor of the rice, and the brand of coffee served. Besides that, everything else is great!!! Service is awesome and I love their birthday singing."}
{"text":"Went there lastnight . Eating leftovers today ! Alot of food . Best mexican in vegas though ."}
{"text":"As good as it gets when it comes to the freshest, tastiest Mexican food in town.  Everything is lovingly prepared and oh so delicious.  Add the best servers in town, and this is the place for you.  Don't forget to try their famous margaritas too!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place.  The view was gorgeous but I've had better fajitas at chili's!  The busser was on top of it, but the waiter was a little weird.  The horchata was about the only thing that I can say was really good, which is sad because I've heard so many good things about this place.  We probably won't be going back, if it wasn't for the ambiance."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has only has 3.5 stars. For my opinion, after coming here for many years, It's a solid 4.5 stars. Now because their rate is low, I'll give them the 5 stars. Fast and professional service, Fun atmosphere, And most important good food!  Not my first, and definitely not my last. Trust me. I know food."}
{"text":"The two stars are just for service and ambiance, I agree with some of the other reviewers that the view of Las Vegas is beautiful, the food lacks in taste and quality though.  I had high hopes when we pulled in to meet another couple for dinner as the parking lot was full.  The food is on the mild side which cater to milder palettes.  My friend ordered the marinated pork chops, expecting 3 succulent chops only to find 3 thin slices of pork chops, which looked as if a pork chop was sliced into three.  Her fiance ordered the green chili burrito combo asking for just beans, cheese, rice, and sauce since he is a vegetarian, but they added pork into it.  My bf ordered a cobb salad and enchilada a la carte and did not enjoy his meal.  I ordered the Carnitas Fajitas and did not enjoy the taste.  It did not taste fresh and it lacked flavor...tasted like it was never marinated and came out of a slow cooker.  I actually took it back to the hotel room and doused it with the salsa I had leftover from the catering truck we purchased our breakfast from earlier, which was much cheaper and had more flavor.  Since some other reviewers raved about the \"delicious and different corn tortillas\", I ordered those with my meal to find stale corn tortillas that were most likely store bought, not homemade at all.  While I was packing my takeout container, they staff quickly took the tortillas...maybe to reuse since mine tasted old and stale?  As far as the salsa and beans served with chips prior to ordering the meal, the chips were cold, salsa was very bland, beans were nothing remarkable.  The fideo soup actually did have good flavor, but lacked substance.  The atmosphere was also very loud with music, so it is not a place to gather for people who are trying to catch up.  They were very busy so I am sure they will not miss our business.  I have had much better Mexican food in other restaurants and taco shops/stands."}
{"text":"Awesome view of the Strip and great mexican food.  We had the chile rellenos and some tacos.  Very good food and service was very friendly.  A big place with most tables having some sort of view."}
{"text":"I really, really, want to give Lindo a better rating but each time there is something that lets me down.   The food: Awesome. The flavor is great and the menu is vast. You are sure to find something you like here. The chips and salsa are great too. I usually order the chicken or veggie fajitas which are fantastic or the carne asada tostada - love it. They also serve this awesome tomato/garlic soup before dinner. I love it.   The service: Sub-par. The waiters are always friendly, but they always mess up at least one of the orders. It's frustrating. Not sure if it is the language barrier or what, but without fail, something usually goes wrong.   The atmosphere: Great views of the strip and Henderson. The downside is they keep it hella loud. On top of the talking, they have live music. Instead of being entertaining, it is mildly annoying if you are sitting around it.   The parking: On a Friday or Saturday night, there is never enough parking. You either end up walking a bit or parking across the street which is \"not allowed\"  My recommendation is, if you are going to eat here, go for lunch. The food is worth it, but the noise and service on a weekend is not."}
{"text":"We had lunch at 1P; waited about 10 minutes for a table, ordered from the Lunch Menu.  Great, friendly service and terrific food, reasonable prices.  Tortillas made fresh, on the premises.  Fresh ingredients.  Best Mexican we've had for years."}
{"text":"From the airport my family picked me up and we went directly to this great Mexican restaurant. This was a good break from all the TexMex I've been enjoying in Htown. The view was great, the dining room buzzing and the wandering mariachis come over to sing you a 'Happy Birthday!' plus a shot or two of tequila. My Carnitas plate was just right but what got me going were the chips and their flavorful, hot salsa! The 'made-to-order-at-your-table' guacamole was a sight to see and taste. GO ALREADY!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, this is the place to go. Other places that boast authenticity usually cater a more \"tex-mex\" palatte. Lindo Michoacan is the real deal. Though it is supposed to be \"gourmet\" food, the reality is that it straight-forward Mexican food. It is what most Mexicans eat at home, which is why it is a nostalgic place to go if you're Mexican. The food is well seasoned, and it is very similar to what you would get in Mexico. By this, I mean that the chef does not randomly use cumin and cilantro, like other places. I ordered the Milanesa, which was done to perfection, and the rice and beans that came as side dishes were perfect. My husband ordered the Carnitas, and they were also cooked very well, and perfectly seasoned. Before you are served entrees, you are treated with chips to dip in salsa and refried beans. The chips were sub-par (I would have expected freshly fried \"totopos\"), but the salsa was excellent and not ketchup-y at all. The refried beans were also delicious, and had no hint of the often confusing cumin! We shared a Queso Fundido as an appetizer. It was very good, except for the tortillas. I would have expected home-made flour tortillas, but instead we got huge, burrito-style flour tortillas that almost put me off the entire meal. But, since the food was so good, I was willing to overlook this major detail. Further, you also get a cup of Fideo Soup, which is a Mexican noodle soup. It is a very simple dish, but so many get it wrong. This one was executed perfectly. Overall, the food is excellent and authentically Mexican. The decor is tacky, but so are most places in this town!"}
{"text":"The restaurant overall had a really good atmosphere. The employees were really professional and always checked in if we needed anything. They start you off with chips and salsa along with fried beans and have a wide variety of different meals whether you crave chicken, seafood, beef etc. they offer different plates on the menu. The food I ordered was good however my 7 year old sons food was a bit cold. Overall I liked the food and experience."}
{"text":"This place is very meh for me. I went there the other night for the first time and was severely unimpressed with the food. One of my favorite things about going to a Mexican restaurant is the chips and salsa, but was soooooo let down with how bad theirs was. Just a nasty chip with a dark red sauce that you can tell is just chili powder. My GF and I tried several items on two combo plates, and nothing stood out. Just all very mediocre.   The one good thing about our experience was the service. The service was amazing. The guys watching our group were on their game, and really impressed us. So if I could, I would give 5 stars for service and 1 star for food. If I could give my rating an over all 2.5 stars I would."}
{"text":"Last night I went to take my husband for Father's Day.  I had reservations but had to wait about 30 mons.  Not bad. I hadn't been to this location in about 3 years. The customer service was EXCELLENT!  I was there with my 2 kids and my nephew.   I have to say I was extremely disappointed in the food.  I ordered the 2 tacos combination (1 Chicken and 1 beef)  The meat tasted like WATER.  When I say it had absolutely no seasoning, I MEAN NADA! My husband ordered the carne asada plate and the meat was not seasoned at all either. My nephew ordered the Torta sandwich, OMG the meat was red and chunky. Just a bad food experience overall"}
{"text":"my girls and i would stop by all the time and would always enjoy our evenings here but this time my bf and i decided to stop by for brunch and wasnt that wowed about it...sure they had a variety of food but it wasnt tasty as their regular dishes...the only good thing was that we left paying $25 for brunch and 8 margaritas which were included in the brunch...oh and cant forget about the homemade tortillas made there...stop by and order from their regular menu you cant go wrong with that...btw the service here is awesome they are all very welcoming and always on top of things!"}
{"text":"Pros: GREAT spot for a date night or to treat visiting family/friends in terms of the city view, fun atmosphere, and price point. Also, they do not use lard in their frijoles/beans! Cons: I would have preferred they serve tortilla soup with meals versus the uneventful fideo chicken soup and some meals turned out to be dry. However, I'll still be back!"}
{"text":"Been here before just never paid attention to it...the reason we have come back was because a friend of my wife gave her a gift certificate and now....I must say really really good and authentic as you can get on this side of town(summerlin).  The service spot on the food was great...the Carnitas reminded me ol town San Diego crispy on the outside and soft and flavorful on the inside....horchata out the gun ok was still good LA mojara was great and the tortillas hecha a mano was a good touch also simple but a big reminder of my grandma(Chichi) cooking fideo soup Next time I would like to come down for Cinco de mayo and hear some marachis..."}
{"text":"Came her with a group of people. Overall average. The food was decent. Service was good. And desert churros were great. I will return to this place again."}
{"text":"We rely on Yelp reviewers for a great Mexican restaurant while in town. All of the great Yelp reviews lead us here. We were greeted as soon as we walked in, seated and quickly served chips, hot refried beans, and salsa while we waited for our order. The decor was fabulous and always great to see the Mexican heritage. Our food was brought out rapidly and our server and the manager kept checking up on us to see if we needed service or anything else. The food was amazing and since my husband is from Michoac√°n, he said the food tasted like his moms. Kudos to me for finding this place!!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife love this restaurant. I've only tried one bad thing on the menu (which was my bad because it was a Coca Cola marinaded steak and I hate sweet meats). They always have live music and delicious margaritas (often they are very heavy handed with the tequila which I love!). The salsa is good (nothing to write home about though) and they have really good guacamole. Good restaurant overall."}
{"text":"Great food, great view, great atmosphere. The service was the best. Our waiter was fantastic. His name was Jorge or something. (Serious resting face, great smile, pitch black hair) Food came out fast even though it was so busy. Been there 2 other times. Nothing to complain about... Except parking... Small parking lot sucks."}
{"text":"The food is unbelievable. Had the carnitas plate. Maybe the best I have ever had. The guacamole is made fresh at the table. My wife had the shrimp and loved the dish. Everyone else had the fajitas and thought it was the best they ever had. Must go to in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"In the years since I wrote my first review, we've come to love Lindo Michoacan at this location. The staff is friendly and attentive, and the food never disappoints. The Mole Poblano is a family favorite, as is any of the carnitas dishes. And if you go, don't forget the table side guacamole. We try every Mexican place we come across, but we keep coming back to Lindo."}
{"text":"One of the best sit-down mostly authentic Mexican food restaurants in Las Vegas.  Better than the sister restaurant in Henderson.  Been here a few times already.  Best to make a reservation- lines get long, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"It's very shocking to me to see such a nice place have such bland and tasteless food. I mean even the case so dip was bad. ? I kid you not it was Jack cheese melted on top of a green Chile. You couldn't even dip a chip in there because it was a robbery hard piece of cheese. Nothing mixed in with the melted cheese just melted cheese on top of green Chile. It wasn't edible. Their guacamole is OK but how can you screw up guacamole. The enchilada sauce was flavorless. No spice at all.  This is a place for people to go have Mexican food who don't like Mexican food. This is a great place for atmosphere and a Mexican vibe with none of the spice or flavor of authentic Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic and my favorite place for lunch in Henderson. We decided on this place because a colleague was craving something spicy and my sister said this was the place to go. The menu at first was a bit overwhelming but the back page was all their lunch specials (36 of them LOL) and we all ended up picking from there.   One of my colleagues went with Taco Salad which was enormous and from the looks of it and his opinion delicious and they other (craving spicy) Camarones a la Diabla which was exactly the spice she was craving.  I went with their classic Carne Asada which was excellent. Steak was cooked just the way I wanted it and the sides were also good. All in all was an excellent meal and I will be coming back next time in the area."}
{"text":"Ehhhh. I wasn't too impressed for all the hype it has. It's ok but not authentic Mexican food. I think it's very commercialized. I ordered the shrimp fajitas. The shrimp was tiny and extremely dry. My husband ordered the carne asada and it was hard as a rock. The margaritas were watered down. Bean dip was good. Queso Fundido was good too. Maybe we went on a too crowded night. I will say the service was great though."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I've never had a bad experience here. Last time we came was Cinco De mayo and they always give out free stuff and the mariachi band is playing live music but no matter what time of the year it's always a good time at Lindo.   This last visit  we came we were seated immediately and our server was prompt on taking our order and greeting us. Complimentary beans and salsa came out right away but be careful not to eat a lot of them because you will get full fast. My boyfriend loves micheladas so he ordered one of those I'm not a beer drinker and don't drink a lot so I had a coke. Straight from the bottle like in Mexico. I swear that is the only way to drink coke it just does something that a can doesn't do.   We decided to order from the lunch menu to save a few bucks and I didn't know that it came with a free soft drink otherwise I wouldn't have ordered the coke. Call me frugal but hey I might be ;). My boyfriend who loves anything pork ordered carnitas which was juicy and tender. I had enchiladas one beef and one chicken. Super good. Both come with rice and beans and I couldn't even finish both enchiladas because I was already full after having chips and beans. The carnitas also came with fresh guac and fresh tortillas. Man those were yummy. Lunch specials do not come with sopa de fideo so we also ordered some of that prior to eating our entrees.   Plenty of busboys and staff checking on us  throughout our meal despite being Busy on Fourth of July , people must have been craving Mexican food. I'm always craving Mexican food and I never get tired of it and Lindo never let's me down."}
{"text":"Not great, certainly not bad.  I've heard their fresh guacamole is excellent but it's pricey. (I haven't tried it yet).  Their lunch specials are great. I love their green chille pork burrito, their salsa and chips are really good, Their burrito was just ok. Their soup is SO yummmy   Service is VERY nice and REALLY fast   They are a little pricey though on their regular menu."}
{"text":"A Las Vegas staple, this is definitely the go to place when you want some good Mexican cooking. It goes way beyond the taco, burrito, enchilada fare and has a menu full of of excellent dishes made with steak, chicken, shrimp or fish. So many to choose from you won't even get through the full menu on your first visit.   One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. Homemade tortillas, chips and hot sauce, great atmosphere, great service, there is nothing about Lindo that disappoints. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been going here on and off since they opened this location.  Either my taste buds have changed over the years, or their food has gotten bad.  I've gotten their chile relleno about half a dozen times and the last time was the worst.  No flavor, soggy, just not what I would call a chile relleno.   Service is always good and servers are attentive.  But I really do think they need to change the way they make their food or have their cooks taste their food (so they can make it better)."}
{"text":"It is my second time eating here. I am not a local so i cant enjoy this place as much as i wish i could so when i am in Vegas i make sure i eat here at least once. The food is great! Some things are not completely \"authentic\" but its as close as you can get. The table-side guacamole is so good. I has the beef flautas this time and they were so good. The place is not cheap but the portions are huge. The agua de Jamaica was delicious! The bus boys/waiters are on it! As soon as my cup was half full they immediately came to refill it, and when i say immediately i mean it... They are so attentive and i never had to ask for anything since they offered way before i even thought about it. We enjoy eating here so much because the place looks so nice and authentic, the service is great and all the food we have tried has really surprised us so far. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Grew up in Los Angeles. Been to Mexico more times than I can remember. Have eaten at virtually every Mexican restaurant in the valley over the past 25 years (including all the family places around Eastern and MP etc..). First time ever someone tried to convince me an enchilada  was really a burrito. Didn't argue, wasn't worth the effort. Disappointed as I've eaten here many times before..... Signed, Disillusioned Asian who grew up thinking he was Mexican...."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this restaurant for a long time so had high expectations. I love Mexican food. The view is 5 star. We went at lunch so I imagine the evening is spectacular. The regular margarita on the rocks was okay. For $9 I think I expected a little better. They give you chips and salsa and bean dip. Which were okay. I had carne asada tacos and the meat was a little fatty for me and they tasted okay. The lunch came with beans and rice which was good. My friend ordered the chicken enchiladas. I did not try them but they looked very good. Service was good. I will return but probably not order carne asada tacos."}
{"text":"One of the best views overlooking the Vegas valley. This restaurant has multi-level seating which leaves a lot of seating to enjoy the view. The staff is always friendly and smiling. They have a decent lunch menu and good happy hour prices. I had the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans, and my partner in crime had a taco salad with grilled chicken. I would visit this restaurant again"}
{"text":"I came here expecting so much.  I've lived in Vegas for years and always heard such great things about this place.  Plus, they're on the 'Best Of' list for years. Wow was I disappointed.  Service was pretty much non-existent - the other reviewer that made the comment about the lack of refil on chips and salsa was accurate.  However, we didn't even get a refill on our water.  The food was pretty tasteless.  My daughter posted a vine about the absent server because it was so obvious.  Now at least I can say I've tried the famous Lindo Michoacan... don't have anything good to say about it. For the price, the quality was sub-standard.   Bloody Mary came in a thick, narrow glass so the content was very small - it was overpriced and under-tasty, too.  I'll stick with Taco Bell for a better Mexican meal."}
{"text":"I've been here several times as well as the one in Vegas. The staff is always great, the food decent (the guacamole and bean dip is great!), and their margaritas are perfect! Whenever we are in Vegas we always go eat here because its that good!!"}
{"text":"The food here is 1 star at best. The location overlooking the strip and the service are the only reasons I gave it 2 stars. No joke- my family and I have eaten here at least 5 times where at least one person left feeling sick. Not sick like you ate bad chicken, sick like you consumed 5 lbs of salt. Gross. In addition, it's very HOT inside like they refuse to turn on the AC in the desert heat. If I'm forced to come here for some reason, I literally will not eat even the chips because of how much salt they use on everything."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and this place is the bomb!  Went in a party of five.  Everyone got something different and everyone loved their meal.  Best Mexican food I've had anywhere.   The service was excellent - friendly and helpful.   The price of our meal came out to less than what we paid for our hotel's crap dinner buffet and was of far better quality.   It's worth traveling off the strip for that's for sure."}
{"text":"We came here for my sisters birthday and it was great.  We made a reservation so we got a great seat, the view was amazing, food was great! My husband got Novello al co√±ac.... It was so good... Much better than my tacos al pastor.  It was a great time with my family. Manny was a great server the don julio anejo was so sweet and smooth, it was a great way to end our dinner:)"}
{"text":"The best, most authentic Mexican you will find. Good prices, always awesome service....a Vegas Favorite! I love there flour chicken flauntas."}
{"text":"Had a really nice time. Great location. Packed!!! But the wait wasn't too long.  They come around to the table often to check and make sure all is well. The 'only' thing that could get better  in my opinion is the parking. Besides that this place is awesome."}
{"text":"Wow. Food is a 5. Service is a 5. Ambiance and atmosphere is a 5. Hands down the best Mexican food I've had. You feel like your in a old Mexican restaurant , in Mexico. Service is non stop. Someone is always tending to your needs. Wow."}
{"text":"Visited Lindo for lunch today. I hadn't been there in a while but I noticed that their wait staff was much more attentive. Everyone greeted us with a smile and seemed happy to work there. A restaurant can have great food but it's the service that will always get me to come back!"}
{"text":"Holy cow! We were looking for a good Mexican restaurant in the Las Vegas area, and after researching Yelp, found this place. It was AMAZING! Very impressed. It's clean, fresh, tasty and has fantastic service. Recommend A+++!"}
{"text":"Want a great view of The Strip while you drink your margarita and enjoy good food? COME HERE!  The food here is good and their prices are average. The service is great. They're very accommodating with large parties and children. Their margaritas are great - not too weak. The table-side guacamole is delicious.   They also give chips, salsa and a bean dip. All three are great. I like having a little bit of salsa and bean dip on my chip."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very nice servers here. But: I've been three times, and 2 of the 3 it was deafeningly loud. The \"open\" floorplan that another Yelper praised means that the more people there the louder it is. Take someone there who is a bad conversationalist and you'll be fine. But not intimate. Not romantic. Not in the least."}
{"text":"I am always looking for a good place to take relatives from out of town. Somewhere that is only in Vegas and not a chain. My Cousin was visiting from out of town and we went here on a Friday for lunch. The parking lot was very full so I was worried there would be a long wait. We were greeted at the door and immediately seated. We were given chips, salsa and bean dip right away. They were nice and fresh. Our drink orders were taken and delivered and our food came out really fast! I had the lunch enchilada special. It was very tasty. The service and food were excellent! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place used to be so good, it has become a touristy move the table place. Food wasn't even hot, temperature wise"}
{"text":"If nothing else go here for the view, it is amazing.Overlooks the whole valley. Food is great . First time there was @ night and it was very loud and very crowded. I prefere going to lunch here."}
{"text":"I've been going to Lindo Michooacan La Loma for years, actually it's become a part of my family go-to spot for Mexican food. Aside from the beautiful view of the city you can see from the restaurant, lots of fond memories with friends and family have happened there.    I must have eaten everything on the menu at least once, but if I had to pick a few items I like the most its the \"Chile Verde De Marrano\", \"Pollo Rebeca\" and \"Tora ala Coca-Cola\" all very delicious.   Service is great!! I've never experienced a problem even on busy days, they are attentive and are a courteous staff. In fact, one of the bartenders her name is Erica became a friend of mine. She's very cool, knowledgeable and a good person to have a chat.     All in all I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times in the past and every time I had left disappointed in the food and service. But this review is based solely on my experience today 05-17-16.   First off, I want to say that our server Manny was the nicest and accommodating server I have ever had at this place, which was a nice breath of fresh air. I had questions on what the tamarindo and Jamaica juice were and he was kind enough to bring me a sample of each which I completely appreciated. I ended up satisfied with the tamarindo.   Second off I will suggest to get the guacamole for an appetizer. I love and appreciate that they make it fresh at the table. It is my favorite item on the menu for that exact reason.   Thirdly I will say that the reason I gave this place 3 stars is merely based on my personal preference in their food. I suppose I have yet to find an entree that I like. I have tried the tacos, Tortas and burritos and I haven't had a single entree I can say that I liked or enjoyed. also the menu can be vague and difficult to understand, especially if you don't know Spanish, but again that's were I commend Manny our server for answering all my questions and having patience with me!   So I appreciate that the service has moved up a notch or two since I've last been there! My time was very enjoyable I just wish there was something I could find that I could enjoy as well as my experience!! But I am happy that they have improved their staff and service and I guess I will be back to find something I love!! I am determined!!"}
{"text":"excellent customer service, food very delicious the enchiladas with red sauce and shrimp is very good. but a very noisy place, you can't even hear yourself!"}
{"text":"Haven't had authentic Michoacan food since I was younger traveling to Morelia. The overall service was great, server was prompt and helpful, busser didn't waste any time clearing our plates out of the way. The chips and salsa AMAZING! Never seen any place serve bean dip with their chips which was great even though it needed a bit of salt. I would advise come hungry if you're doing the apps and entree with dessert. Oh before I forget they serve breakfast day or night!!!"}
{"text":"Cool Henderson hang/eating spot. Great views and drinks. Servers are always nice! Killer guacamole and salsa! One of our go to spots for sure! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Sunday night dinner drove up and parking lot and street was full of cars. We got seated immediately and great chips salsa and bean dip sipped a nice margarita while looking at the extensive menu.  We ordered carnitas and fajitas. Service was prompt food was amazing. Our waiter recommended mango cake for desert. It was amazing. Love this place and we will return soon. View was also beautiful."}
{"text":"I've gone to this restaurant several times with my family & it never disappoints! There's plenty of food and it tastes sooo good!! Not to mention that the view of the strip is beautiful. This restaurant is perfectly set up so you can over view the strip and at night time it looks breathtaking! Definitely recommend for good food and a beautiful view!"}
{"text":"Loved this place and the view. Service was great, went here for a family birthday party and my sister was capped with a sombrero, and given a shot !! We kept the drinks flowing. Totally recommend this Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"This review is long over due I have had the pleasure of enjoying this food on multiple occasions every time we have friends, family and just if the temptaion becomes too great we visit Lindo, I have had good, bad and horrible mexican food in this town but I will say in my opinion it does not get better then this. Authentic, flavorful, fresh, original and served by an extremely attentive wait staff. My daughter and her fiance never miss an opprotunity to eat here when in town they live in California (where I am from) and thought all the best mexican food could be found... but I was wrong it took me 3 1/2 years to find this place and I will always be a loyal patron, if only for the table side guacamole, (yes I know this isnt impressive) but it is always flawless...the Pork Chili Verde has so much flavor like it has been cooked with love for hours.  I have had breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner here it never disappoints, it can be very busy on Holidays and weekends but it is worth the wait and the view did I mention the view? It is worth seeing especiall at sunset or after dark. Try it you will like it if you enjoy authentic deep rich flavors and quality fare you will become addicted to this place."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever! Get a seat close to the window because it's a million dollar view!! The waiters and busboys are super attentive. The service is truly outstanding. Their menudo is the best cure for a Vegas hangover. We always stop here when we get to Vegas and before we leave. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Close to my house and a great view but the food is just okay! They do have great shrimp ceviche but their  hot foods  aren't too impressive! For the price their are many other great Mexican restaurants to go to!"}
{"text":"Went to the Sat. Brunch. For around $14 u get all you can eat, 1 Alcoholic drink, Unlimited Drinks(including mexican drinks like Horchata, etc) Unlimited fresh handmade tortillas & Salsa/Dips.  The food had plenty of choices and were AUTHENTIC homestyle cooked foods. Some of the Choices included: Scramble egg dishes like \"a la Mexicana\" & \"with Chorizo\", They had salad & Nopales. Chilaqueles (Red & Green), All kinds of Mexican Stews like \"Beef Chile Rojo\", \"Chile Verde(Pork)\", FANTASTIC Carnitas(Bone in), Chicken Mole, Camarones ala Diabla and other classic mexican Meat stews. The BIRRIA de Chivo(Goat) was my favorite dish(topped with Onion, Cilantro and lime), my running mates said the MENUDO was fantastic but i couldnt stop eating the Birria so i didnt try it. It was so good all my buddies went again on Sunday but i decided to skip brunch and just workout the hangover lol. The Brunch ends at 2pm so my buds ordered Enchiladas verde de Pollo(Chicken/Green), Carne Asada Soft tacos(with Handmade tortillas), Caldo de Res, Enchiladas Rojas de pollo(Red/Chicken) and a Chicken Quesadilla to go. Everything was between 4-5stars, The Green Enchiladas & the Caldo de Res were perfect 5 stars. I also enjoyed the fresh table-made Guacamole, the salsa & bean dip with chips and the Flour hand made tortillas are awesome!!(corn are good too). The bathrooms are great and the atmosphere is very homey. SERVICE WAS SUPERB!!! The food was 5stars but when combined with the GREAT Service guarantees i will come here atleast 2 times everytime i head to vegas!! MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 5ppl with a view, when we get there we are squeezed into a booth for 4 with a chair at the end with no view. I get that its a Saturday night but that's not my problem, that is why I made a reservation.    The food is usually good, but this is the first time it was \"meh\". The guacamole which is one of my favorites, was just okay. I had the carnitas burrito and while the carnitas was cooked perfectly tender, it just had no flavor at all, the same with my mom's chicken fajitas, no flavor.  Sad that a Mexican restaurant has no flavor.  The service was decent but it was so hot that everyone at the table was sweating., I don' think I would go back."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday. Called and made a reservation, asked for a table with view. Got there and seated quickly. Service was amazing. Food was amazing. View was beautiful. This place has great margaritas. Get the Cadillac one. Boyfriend had chicken burrito, I had a steak with green sauce. We got the flaming dessert. Everything tastes so fantastic. And don't forget to order table side guacamole. Mmmmm. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Word to the wise... If you are solo or just two- sit at the bar. You'll get exponentially faster service and no wait.  Love the food. Best fideo I've ever had. Lindo never disappoints- and the view is priceless."}
{"text":"Always great food! My fav is the mol√©! Can't go wrong with any of their dishes though. Be prepared for a wait unless you make reservations & even then you might have to wait a while"}
{"text":"This is literally my favorite restaurant in Vegas. They are typically pretty busy so you need to have time but, oh god, is it worth the wait.  They give the unusual chips and salsa when you sit but they also give retried beans as well. My toddler loves to dive into those as soon as we sit. Speaking of, they also immediately bring out a bowl of Fidel soup for the kiddos too. Don't worry, you get yours before your meal, after you order. The drinks are strong, the food is delicious, and you will have leftovers for the breakfast munchies you will have from all those margaritas. We take anyone who comes to town there and we have always been thanked numerous times afterwards. Go there. Now!"}
{"text":"Wow super super super super super legit. Very happy leaving. Full belly food food and a Michoacan spirit i havent seen since Los Angeles. Im a white boy and never knew how much i missed this culture until being away for a bit. Thanks for the first meal looking forward to many more!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best mexican I've had in town...so far.  Very authentic and they have a huge menu that should suit every taste.  In the middle room you can even see the tortillas being freshly made.  The only thing that was bad about my second trip was the fact that for the life of me I couldn't remember what I got the first time to order it again...but my second meal was excellent as well.  The guac is made table side and is super fresh.  I love making homemade guac myself and actually will not make it without cilantro anymore because they used it at Lindo and it really made a difference.  We live a good 6 miles or so away and on the way everyone was asking why we were traveling so far for this restaurant and if we were getting Mexican food, why we couldn't go to one of the one hundred places that are closer.  By the end of the meal everyone need why and gave me kudos for the selection.  It will be hard to go anywhere else when I have a craving for Mexican food."}
{"text":"This the the BEST Mexican joint in Vegas. The food is really good, service is cool and price is quite reasonable. The inside atmosphere and decoration is pretty cool too. Also, this place is ALWAYS crowded during lunchtime and dinner time. Finding a parking spot can be hard and a challenge during their peak time. DEFINITELY visit this place once if you're ever in Vegas and craving for some good Mexican food. However, it may take 15+ mins drive from the Strip area."}
{"text":"I have nothing but great things to say about this place. It is a bit of a drive off the strip, but it is so very worth it. To start off, the bean dip and salsa were amazing and tasty. I had a craving for camarones aguachiles and ordered that as an appetizer. If you love VERY spicy chile, these will not disappoint! I ordered the tacos de carne asada which were so delicious and tried some of the Carnitas a la Coca-Cola which was also tasty. The staff was super friendly and attentive which made the experience as a whole even better. If you're looking for a delicious, authentic Mexican meal for a good price go visit Lindo Michoacan!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I was in Vegas for a conference at the Hilton and looking for a good place to eat because the casino food was horrible and expensive.  A friend recommended this place.  He also recommended the guacamole that was made at the table. Wow again, the guacamole was amazing!  There were 4 of us and we each had a different item for the main course, each one was delicious.  Can't wait to go back!  The margaritas aren't bad either.. :-)"}
{"text":"Coming from California and having so many amazing Mexican Food in L.A...this spot was pretty good.  The ambiance was super cool! I was totally digging the mariachi.  For me drinks/cocktails are important and they sure as heck passed the test on that.   They serve bean dip, salsa and chips as soon as you arrive.  I like that! It was pretty authentic considering that this restaurant is in Vegas.  For dinner I had the chicken enchiladas w/green sauce.  They were Delish! Just make sure you ask for your soup or salad if it comes with your meal because they forgot to serve me mine and I didn't realize it until I was already in the car.  Regardless, I'll definitely try it again when I'm in town & craving Mexican food. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow! If you are visiting Las Vegas and want to have REAL, authentic Mexican food, then you have go here. The state of Michoacan is known for their Carnitas so I would suggest you try them. The food is amazing and the customer is outstanding. It seems like more and more restaurants are incorporating  the buddy system. We had  several waiters and this kept everything flowing, everyone was happy and had a great time."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great restaurant.  When your in the mood for Mexican, you've got to try Lindo Michoacan.  This place is great.  They had live music, the best view of the city, great food, great service and awesome margaritas.  I was a bit nervous when we pulled up since there were about 40 cars parked on the street and the lot was full.  We went to the hostess and asked how long it would be for a table of 3 with a view?   She said we can seat you right now.  I was like OK!, let's do this...   we sat down and immediately had our drink order taken and had our food order soon after.  We got chips and salsa, followed by some amazing soups and then we all got different combo plates.  Mine was chili releno, chicken taco and a beef burrito w/beens and rice.  Everything was perfect and it came with a side of roasted jalape√±os.   PERFECT"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, service, ambiance, and prices.  I've eaten here several times and walk away with a full belly and sated appetite.  I've come with my wife and large groups, always a good time!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times throughout my pre-yelping days.   True and true, the food is awesome, as always.   Today , the service was pretty bad. A lot of annoying little mistakes mostly by the seemingly undertrained youngsters on the staff. I could go through the mistakes one by one, but that isn't really necessary. It is simply a matter of finding employees who not only are good at providing good service but truly desire to give good service.   The saving grace. Juan Carlos came in and the service level shot through the roof. He must have been on break or something. If all the service personnel offered his level of professionalism, they'd have a world class place here."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to any Lindo Michoacan and I can't believe it hasn't been sooner. Authentic Mexican food is awesome, but I didn't realize they also have mariachis. Did I mention that I love mariachis? And they were not crappy ones either. But anyway I came here for dinner and drinks with some coworkers. They had mango margaritas which were tasty (and I don't even like mango) and I had a watermelon margarita which was very good. I could hardly choose what to get but settled on the Steak Ranchera (about $20) and it was delicious. They also bring you chips and salsa of course which were good but the little cup of sopa de fideo they bring before your entree was friggin amazing. I need to figure out how to make it like that cuz it was the bomb, I could just have a big bowl of that in the winter, with some tortillas.... mmmm. I ate til I was stuffed and had enough steak and rice and beans left for lunch the next day. Also my coworkers told me that they have $5 margaritas for happy hour? Regardless I need to come more often for mariachis and delicious generous food."}
{"text":"Fifteen years ago when we first moved to the Las Vegas area we were told (incorrectly) that Macayo's was the best Mexican food in Las Vegas.  Their food was good until we tasted Lindo Michoacan's food - their food is not good it is great.  We have never returned to eat Macayo's canned Mexican food.    Being an adventurous eater I judge Mexican food establishment by two simple rules.  Do they offer on their menu proteins like lengua?  If you don't offer at least lengua then you are not a true Mexican eatery.  Lindo offers lengua.  Do you offer a salsa for the more spicier inclined?  Lindo offers a spicer house salsa - just ask the server when they bring you the regular salsa and chips.  Two for two.    The food at Lindo's tastes fresh and their menu is loaded with several choices to fit any palate.  Servers are attentive, knowledgeable of their menu, and quickly whisk away to quickly fulfill your orders.    As for the negatives - none of them are about the food - that's rare.  The Original Lindo's is small and yet packs in the booths and tables as close as humanly possible.  This can make it hard to navigate around for those traveling to use the restroom or in our case those that are handicap and use a walker/wheelchair.  Packing everyone in also means that this place is loud.  At times it can be hard to carry a conversation with your friends/family.  Even worse sometimes on the weekend they employ a DJ to blast out music which makes conversing even harder.  Outside the parking lot can get packed with cars as the restaurant doesn't have enough spaces it should for its popularity.  Be prepared for some patience to find a parking spot and waiting for a booth or a table.    Last negative - and it is an interesting one to note.  This location allows individual/groups to \"buy-out\" the restaurant.  It was disheartening to make plans to catch up with friends I hadn't seen in 3+ years only to be turned away because the restaurant had been bought out for the night.  We got off easy as we quickly researched another restaurant on our phones and then set off in our cars but we saw others who had taken taxis to eat dinner only to turned away.  For our inconvenience we were handed a \"coupon\" for a free margarita on our next visit - yet the \"coupon\" made no mention of it and looked like a standard flyer.  Personally, I think they should have given a recommendation for another good Mexican restaurant in the area (especially for the poor people who took/paid for the taxi).    But this is a restaurant and although hospitality and accessibility are indeed very important pieces it comes down to the food.  In the 10+ times I've been here I've never had a food related complaint.  However, now I may just have to call ahead to make sure they are not \"bought out\" for the night."}
{"text":"I stop in for the lunch menu every now and then. The service is always very friendly and speedy. I usually get a taco and cheese enchilada."}
{"text":"A must try! The bomb. I recommend their Shrimp fajitas, their bean dip and salsa is the bomb. I could eat that all night! Their tortillas are made by hand in front of the restaurant by a lady in typical dress of Michoacan, exhibition style. The waiters are in formal dress also. Though casual dress is totally acceptable. This place has been here a lot of years, at least passed 31 plus...the owner I've known since the mid nineties when I worked at the cable company. Very nice guy and strict with his restaurants food, presentation and it shows! He owns another one on Decatur and Twain which is another \"The Bomb.com\" A high recommendation to both thesevrestaurants. Will not disapoint."}
{"text":"This maaaay be my favorite full service Mexican restaurant in Vegas. The Henderson location is my favorite location because of the stunning view of the strip (ask for a seat by the window) and the Desert Inn location is my favorite because of the ambiance. It's a bit more lively and authentic feeling.   A few of my favorite dishes include the avocado salad (shrimp ceviche served in two avocado halves), the camarones sarandiados (OMG THAT SAUCE), and the lengua en salsa verde (for you cow tongue lovers).   The homemade tableside guacamole and chips are a must.  You're welcome!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for years but a different location.  This was my first time here Saturday afternoon and we had the worst service.  When my friend and I were seated they gave us water but never asked us for drinks.  We had to ask our waitress over to order drinks then again flag her down to place our order 20 minutes later.  Once the kitchen delivered our meal, we never saw our waitress again.  We had to flag down someone else to refill our water and once again to get our check.  We were completely ignored while we were there.  Worst service ever, very disappointed.  I'll continue to go to the Henderson location."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food spot in town. The chips are always great, love the fajitas, tacos, and drinks are great!"}
{"text":"Incredible service kept the bean dip flowing all night long! Our beans never hit empty. My tea glass was perpetually full. Between our waiter, the server assistant and the manager, who all visited our table, we experienced impeccable service. The service alone earns a shiny star!  The restaurant is fancy-schmancy in an Epcot way. (Point on Andrew M!) They also have a nice patio with misters. We decided to sit inside, and I think it is a tad dark in there. I had to squint to read the menu.  After some squinting, I remembered one of the reasons we don't go out for Mexican too often- In comparison to my days in Georgia, Mexican spots are more expensive than I anticipate. $18-20 entrees were all over the place.  This isn't a Speedy Gonzalez combo type of establishment. My husband finally selected a fried whole fish, which for around $15 was a great deal, and I went with the vegetarian enchiladas with green sauce.   The whole fish was a sizeable tilapia that the husband thought was terrific, and it came with three sides. I was particularly happy that the veggie enchiladas weren't cheese, but actual saut√©ed vegetables. The tangy green sauce was the perfect complement. And, each of our dishes were under $15, so I felt like we were able to find some value options on the menu, especially given that each comes with a tasty cup of a simple fideo soup.   We had a delicious meal with great service and all the bean dip we could handle. That is a success in my belly."}
{"text":"Ehhhhhhhh plain much??? Service is good... Food is blaaaaaaah. Check out my delicious side salad"}
{"text":"This is my second time here. It is alway very busy. The food is really good. There's not that many Mexican restaurant out in Vegas."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a great location. They have a seating area on the other side of the bar that has a great view of the city.    It's usually packed if you make a couple laps in the little parking area you will usually get a spot.   The food was good it was typical Mexican. The drinks were good service was good."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant while staying in Henderson. Wanted it to be really good since I was taking a friend to lunch. The service was very rushed, the food was terrible. We all ordered the chicken and cheese enchiladas. The chicken was dry, the sauce was dry and not a lot of it, and the rice was clumpy. It's also a very busy and loud restaurant, so if you're going for a quiet lunch....Don't go here."}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican food for a reasonable price. Great atmosphere with an excellent view of Las Vegas. Staff is very attentive and professional, and there's no element of tackiness that plagues so many Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"The view is spectacular, food was OK, margaritas were yummy, but the services were 4 stars."}
{"text":"When you and your 3 friends are the only  gringos in the place you know you're right where you want to be.  Great food. Great service. A bit off the strip. Don't hesitate."}
{"text":"The food presentation was on point although I have to say the food was not outstanding, just okay. The ambience, service and the music were pretty nice."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Authentic delicious Mexican food. Great drinks. Guacamole was on point. The music was fun and the place was full. Service was exceptional and the food was amazing.   Only complaint is it was HOT! in this place. Had to step out a few times cause my whole family was sweating.   Recommend: YES!"}
{"text":"Always love the food here but lately service has not been good. Not sure what changed other than I see some new staff."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever  I have tried lost of Mexican food! But this one meets all my expectations! My kids and husband love to go there! Everything that I have tried! It is so tasty  love that place!!"}
{"text":"A nice change from the usual Mexican joints I'm used to in Atlanta, but nothing great by itself. A small description of the Mexican named dishes would be a nice touch for those not in the know.   The salsa is a nice, but unique change from the usual pureed tomatoes served on the east coast, and with refried beans to boot. The chips are different also, with thicker chips help to mound up salsas, beans, and the queso fundito.  The fish tacos are decent, but nothing to write home about being overly dry, but not totally without flavor. I am used to an aioli or some sort of jalapeno mayo to help moisten the fish, so I just used the salsa instead. Maybe it's just how this place does tacos pescado???   All-in-all I think I would give this place another chance with another set of dishes, so there might be another update in the near future."}
{"text":"Hidden Vegas gem off the strip. Been coming here for years and love it. Signature dish is Toro de Coca Cola. Rib eye marinated in Coca Cola. Its insane. I always order this dish. Also, I am a huge fan of Jalisco Estrella beer and they serve it here on draft. Must try."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and very friendly and courteous staff. The food is good and serves decent portions. I do think that the food is overpriced, it's mostly beans and rice on the plate and a portion of your choosing (i.e shrimp, steak, or chicken). The fact that it's mostly beans and rice on the plate is always what gets to me when it comes to the pricing. Also the steak usually has a lot of fat on it and the shrimp is always extremely over cooked which makes it chewy and rubbery."}
{"text":"I also attended the same dinner that Matt C. and Raymond did. From my perspective, it was Cinco de Mayo and I expected the service to suck. Lindo really shocked me however, with how much they sucked. We didn't leave from our 7 PM reservation until 10:30!!! Not because we were slow, not because we were chatting.. no because service was that awful. An hour to take our order, an hour to drop the check, etc, etc. You expect bad service on Cindo de mayo, but wow they really knocked it out of the park.   The first margarita from the bar was ok. Not great, ok. It tasted like it had some tequila in it, it cost $5, whatever, I was happy. We then proceeded to order margaritas at the table and like others have said - it was a glass of cheap nasty margarita mix. I consider myself an expert margarita drinker (5+ years in Houston will do that for ya!) and these were abysmal . I'd be shocked if they had more than 1/4 shot each of tequila and the mix they use is gross. A margarita with no tequila isn't worth $5, its worth $0!! Please just charge me $7 or something and actually put tequila in it.   I know there was some drama in our group about the spicy guac, but from a mild girl's perspective, the tableside guac was delish! If you don't like it hot you'll probably be very happy with the guac here.   I'm giving them 3 stars because the rest of the food was actually pretty good. The husband and I split the beef crispy taco and flank steak. Flank steak is actually pretty easy to screw up. Theirs was shockingly good. It actually came out medium rare. The flavoring was perfect. Portion was huge. Very damn pleased with our flank steak. Crispy taco was also bada**. Oh and lastly I'm a sucker for GOOD homemade tortillas. Their's were fabulous. Some of the better restaurant tortillas I've had in Vegas.   Overall, apparently avoid Cinco de Mayo, avoid the Margaritas, and get the flank steak."}
{"text":"I was excited to have some authentic Mexican family style food while in Las Vegas. The. Reviews for Lindo Michoac√°n raved and I trick out there with a friend who is traveling with me. The food was not as exceptional as I hoped and to top it off both of us got very bad food poisoning... I am in Vegas for a trade show and had to spend the day in bed. Very sad"}
{"text":"Large menu, good service, great food.  Not much else to say other than its extremely popular and if you go on a Friday or Saturday night at prime time, you will wait.  The view of the city from the window tables has any visitor from out of town thinking the meal was one of their highlights of the trip."}
{"text":"You are paying for the view and atmosphere.  Food is way overpriced and forgettable.    This was our second visit to this restaurant,  (the first time, at dessert, my child got fried ice cream and we didn't know there was peanuts in it.  My child is highly allergic, we had to leave in a hurry) I called the restaurant in hopes of speaking to a manager they might want to put ingredients on their dessert menu (or even a simple disclaimer \"contains nuts\" would do.), never got a call back. This time I got mixed fajitas, it was more like a lunch portion, cost me nearly 20.00! Kids meals are nearly 7.00.  Lindo Michoacan... probably wouldn't hurt my feelings if I never go back."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to this place ... I love it ... It's so original. The food is amazing and the service is excellent. Everyone greets you with a smile. I had the steak fajitas with hand made tortillas."}
{"text":"i would give 10 stars!!, SO delicious!, i brought my uncles, they were in town, from Florida, they were expecting me to take them to a nice place, to have a good lunch and i always heard about this restaurant but i never tried it before, it was my best first time trying it, beautiful place, a lot of parking, delicious food, beautiful waitresses!"}
{"text":"My search for really excellent Mexican food in Vegas continues. But this has become an acceptable placeholder until I find my unicorn. The menu here is large and has many good choices. I got the tamales my first time - and odd choice for me, because I rarely gravitate toward tamales - and they were very good, I'd highly recommend. Another time I got a burrito, and it was above average. The meat here is well cooked (not amazing, but reliable and tasty). The guac is made tableside and made from good ingredients.  Then of course, there is the view. Coming here for happy hour, sitting at the counter and having margaritas, is really the best part of coming here. Bartenders have always been friendly and the drinks are a good deal.  This place would be average at best in So Cal or even Nor Cal, but it's one of the best I've found in Vegas so far."}
{"text":"doesn't get any better than this.  went on a saturday night and surprisingly there wasn't a wait.  we were seated right away.  the chips, salsa and beans were the best ever!  funny how 3 small bowls can make me happy.  i ordered 2 tacos, carne asada and carnitas with a side of rice and beans.  this also came with soap was so good and just like my mom makes.  the service was great even when we kept eating up the chips, salsa and beans.  i've been there about 3 times and look forward to it."}
{"text":"My biggest pet peeve about dining out is sticky menus. I hate sticky menus. The hostesses were washing the menus when we came in the door. I was so glad to see that. We were seated immediately and promptly brought chips/salsa/beans and water. The service was very fast and excellent. My daughter spilled her drink all over the table and the staff swept in and had it completely cleaned up in about a minute. Our food came out quickly and everything was delicious! I can't spell anything that we ordered, but we have eaten here numerous times and have never been disappointed by the food. Our favorites are the fideo soup and sopapillas (the two things on the menu I can properly pronounce lol). We also got a seat by the window so we could enjoy the lovely view of our city. We will most definitely be back. :)"}
{"text":"A friend told me this was the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas so we went for lunch. If this is the best i feel sorry for Las Vegas. The tasteless chips, bean dip and hot salsa were awful. The Fideo soup was a watery mess. My combo contained a dry tasteless tamale, an ok beef taco and a watery burrito.  Super Mex hands down has better Mexican food and more reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The place has a nice decor, the staff are friendly, and they have really good, authentic, Mexican food!  We ordered their guacamole, which was really yummy. They make it table side for you and they provide a pretty well sized bowl of it.  I ordered the asada mole enchiladas, they were delicious! I was a bit nervous about ordering mole because so many restaurants mess it up, but this was perfect. The portions are pretty large and the prices are extremely reasonable. I'll definitely want to come here again. :)"}
{"text":"Views are spectacular! Love the decor and size of the restaurant would be amazing in the evening to look out over the valley. The food was okay to good certainly not the best Mexican food I have ever had but good. I would go back to try some drinks I was there in the middle of the day on business :( so no margaritas this time. While we were there there was a mariachi band that was way way way way too loud, we literally could not hear each other over the table but I am thinking that it was a special occasion and hopefully not the norm."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican Restaurant in Las Vegas. Great service good food and wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Absolutely impeccable service, these people definitely know how to treat customers. Drinks were never empty, table never dirty, fast service . Amazing customer service, great atmosphere. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Loved it. Service can be a bit slow, but they're always busy. The gallo cognac is my absolute fave. Will continue to visit here when I'm in town. Excellent food and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for lunch last week. I've been here before but he hadn't. First thing we ask was for a view of the strip table. They were able to accommodate. You can have happy hour anywhere in the restaurant so that was a plus as well. I got a caddy margarita and it was strong!!! It was delicious tho. German (our waiter) suggested it to me. He was great at customer service. The whole team was. If we were out of chips or water another waiter or bidder would come refill us. My boyfriend got tacos and he said they were great. I could tell because he ate it quick. He said only thing he had an issue with was the fact the taco shell was really hard. I had the chimichanga. I always get it and it always tastes the same. So delicious melts in your mouth. It's always a great experience at Lindo. I suggest you go at night so you can see the strip."}
{"text":"The food, although it's different from what I'm used to, was delicious! The first time we went the waiter was awesome and nice. I am a little disappointed that they don't have mariachi but I'll live. The view is amazing, you can see the whole valley. And the atmosphere is great. The decorations were awesome! And apparently everyone celebrates their birthday there because they sing \"las ma√±anitas\" on a regular!"}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas hands down. We during on the menu is great. Be sure to start your meal worth fresh guacamole made right at your table. After that comes the most difficult task, picking your entree. No matter what you pick, you will enjoy it. This is as authentic as it gets. Enjoy... Highly recommended..."}
{"text":"Always a \"must eat\" whenever we're in Vegas.  This is such a fun place with a menu that you can't go wrong with.  Everything we've eaten here has always been sabroso!  Here are some tips:  1) Love the bean dip & Salsa  2) I'm not usually a fan of ordering chicken at restaurants but they have some awesome chicken dishes 3) Mango Margarita...yummm  Service is always fantastic and sometimes they even have live music :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food. Great service. Love the Enchiladas de Mole con Pollo, tamales, and shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but the food is inconsistent. One time the food is outstanding and the next time the food is overcooked and not hot.  I have eaten here five times now.  This time I left feeling rushed.  One thing going for them is, they have very good margaritas."}
{"text":"...the food is good...the adult beverages are good...and the view is killer...what more do you want...hmmm"}
{"text":"I had the carnitas plate. Some of the best, ministers, carnitas I have ever had. Flan was the best."}
{"text":"Ok service. ok food.  The fideo is yummy!.   I ordered the lobster tails.  They were terrible.  Very chewy for 40 bucks.  The chips and salsa were good.  I would never order the lobster again."}
{"text":"When you are feeling home sick and was craving authentic Mexican food. Im originally from Cali and tried one other place, and it was not close to what we used to be able to eat. After looking up places nearby, we came across this gem. You cannot miss this spot as it is located in Anthem/Henderson, and it is bright orange on the outside.   Before getting to the inside, this is by far one of the best locations for a restaurant. Whether you are coming to lunch to meet up with friends or going on a date with that special someone, the views of the strip are breath taking from the parking lot. Now if you come during dinner time, you can catch the sunset or even enjoy the beatiful lights that fill the skies that vegas is known for.   The service: we arrived a little after 6pm and the place was packed. Luckily, as soon as we got inside, we were seated right away. While looking through the menu, a gentlemen dropped by our table and gave us complimentary  salsa, chips, and beans. Not long after did we place our orders. I ordered the taco de pescado with rice, beans, and soup. My fiance ordered the carne asada torta after looking through their extensive menu. Prices are around $10 to 30, but well worth it.   How everything tasted: ohhh my, the tacos de pescado was fresh and by far the most tender for being grilled. I also loved how the 3 were fully loaded accompanied by ginormous avocado and lemon. They are by for the most generous. It also came with a spicy chipotle style sauce, instead of the original tartar. If you do not like it, fish platter also came with pico de gallo. On the other hand, the carne asada torta, was also ginormous. Big enough that my fiance could not even finish the entire thing! That was a first. All in all, we left with happy tummys.   We were offered dessert, but had to pass. Definitely will have to come back next time to try the dessert."}
{"text":"Service was great. And fast considering we went on May 5th the very first time.  Was seated promptly. Bucket of beer deal was great. Got an opportunity to taste several Mexican beers I had never tried before. And really liked them. The view was awesome. Looking forward to coming back again. Thank you"}
{"text":"Come here at an odd time because it's always packed and it's hard to find a parking spot. It's a surprise to me that this place doesn't have at least 4 stars. You get a nice view of the strip and the food is fantastic. The staff don't seem frantic or annoyed even if they get so busy. They have so many loyal customers including myself. It can get pretty loud especially if there's anybody celebrating their birthday. So, if you're the grumpy kind or having a migraine headache, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Their carne asada enchiladas are the best I've ever eaten anywhere EVER, their chips & salsa are A+ and their appetizer soup is delicious. I'll be coming here whenever I'm in Vegas for the rest of my life..."}
{"text":"Authentic mexican .... love everything here.  Carne asada with jalapenos, Veggie enchiladas, chile colorado, carnitas, cannot go wrong.   My absolute favorite is the fish tacos.  light grilled white fish with mom's special sauce.  too die for.  lindo also has the best rice and beans in town.  light airy and delicious.  service is amazing and the restaurant is always beautifully done.  one the of the best mexican restaurants with affordable pricing."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants I've ever been to. They bring shame and dishonor to mexico"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time tonight. The service was impeccable! Our server was Miguel, and the busser for our section was just as attentive. If anything got low: water, chips, salsa, drinks, it was like they were standing around a corner with refills. I couldn't have asked for better or more kind service. The food however was mediocre at best and the restaurant was REALLY WARM. I think my favorite part of it all was the frozen strawberry margarita. We probably won't be back for food, but thank you to the staff for working so hard to bring great service."}
{"text":"This used to be a favorite, but portions, quality, and service have been declining. :( The entertainment is wonderful, but you pay for that in menu prices these days. Tonight, we had watered down margaritas, fajitas without onion, a chicken taco with  basically just a  fried tortilla, and service that required us to pay through the hostess. I know our server was spread thin, but there is no excuse for the decline in food and price! One last try, Lindo! I want  to want you! (;"}
{"text":"I went here last week with a friend, and it was fantastic.  First of all, I love that they make the guacamole right in front of you.  Very cool!  (And also, it was very delicious!)  I got the vegetarian fajitas (YUM!), and I had enough food for two more meals later - so definitely  value for your money.  The service was also fantastic.  I didn't even have to run out of water before the waiter was at my table giving me more.  I think we had maybe three different waiters attending to different things at our table.  All in all, my friend and I felt very well taken care of!  I recently moved here from the Midwest... never going to eat Mexican back home again.  I'm too spoiled now!  Great experience, and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Came here late night with a friend, and ordered the vegetarian fajitas - yum!  Great service, as well.  We had a couple different wait staff take care of us other than our main waitress, too - all very attentive.  I never got to the bottom of my water glass.  I really liked the decor here, too.  Great place, can't wait to come back!  I've been to their other location in Henderson; it's a win-win!"}
{"text":"Have tried to eat here a few times . Only reason to come here is for the view. The food is not good its kind of expesive dri ks take awhile to get to table. I wouldnt bother there are plenty of very tasty mexican places in south nevada"}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch here.  The chips, salsa and bean dip is wonderful.  I had the #24 lunch special, Shrimp and Garlic with beans and rice.  Camarones de Mojo de Ajo.  Nice and garlicky.  Great sopping the sauce with corn tortillas.  Great service.  Go here for the lunch menu, then try the dinner menu.  It's the bomb!"}
{"text":"I had wanting to try this place for a while after hearing how good it was.  Service started with the waiter bring chips, salsa, and bean dip.  There was something noticeably absent from both the salsa and the beans: salt.  The beans were incredibly bland.  I mixed the salsa and beans together and added salt, and this resulted in a much more flavorful appetizer.    I wanted to try the salsa used in the pollo llora hoy, llora ma√±ana, so the waiter brought a dish of it to the table.  My girlfriend and I quickly emptied the bowl onto our food.  By itself, it did not have too much flavor because it needed salt, but it was a nice addition to other food.  In this quantity, it had a kick but was not terribly scorching.  If it was served in the amount that can be found in the pollo llora hoy, llora ma√±ana, I can imagine the heat would build up to an ass-kicking level.  Being a big fan of mole poblano, I ordered the pollo en mole.  I was hoping and praying that it would be made from scratch and not come out of a jar of Do√±a Maria.  Thankfully, it was from scratch and was quite good.  The chocolate was used to round out the flavors of the chiles not to make the mole sweet. It is definitely one of the best moles I have had in a US restaurant.  The pollo came with beans on the side, which like the bean dip, needed salt.  My girlfriend order the sopitos, half with carne asada and half with chorizo. She enjoyed them but needed to add salt.  The service was great.  The waitstaff was quick to fill up our drinks and bring us anything we needed.  Overall, I would eat there again, but  what prevents me from giving it 5 stars is the under seasoning.  In truth, such egregious under seasoning probably does not even deserve 4 stars.   I am not really into salty foods, even buying reduced-sodium products at the market, but salt is the building block of flavor and without it food is flavorless.  Here, it did not seem like the cooks used any.  At least there was salt at the table."}
{"text":"Wow.. did we love the view and our food! As a bonus too we had great service. The combination plates and our Shrimp Diablo... was so delicious. You get a lot of food for the $. So I would say this is a great date place, birthday celebration place, and a fun group environment. :)."}
{"text":"Loved our servers. Lots of items in the menu. I got the carnitas plate and it was delicious.  Had to take home half of the plate.   The guava margarita is to die for. La torta vegetariana  is huge! My daughter saved half of it for later.   Great food,  great flavor.  I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been here two times and both times have been great! The atmosphere is great and the service is awesome! They refill your drink as soon as you're done. They're on top of everything. I ordered carne asada and man was it good. The chips with bean dip were good. I will make this a must on any trip to Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Love the spot real Mexican food the place is off the strip which is goo not crowded at all service was great will stop buy again when in town"}
{"text":"We found this place by chance and glad that we did! The first two places we looked up were closed. The food was great and service was too! Good red sauce and beans were brought out with the chips! Good lunch specials and large portions! This was the cheapest and best meal I've had in Vegas so far! I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"After being unimpressed with the reviews of the strip Mexican places we decided to cab it out here (a mile or so) and glad we did. Great food, and didn't feel like a Vegas chain but more like some of the family restaurants out this way in California. The traditional mole sauce was killer. Waiter made the guacamole right at the table, adding jalepenos to suit the requested amount of hotness (lots). Excellent, attentive service. One of the better choices for Mexican in Vegas."}
{"text":"Always come here when I'm in Vegas. Even with the unbearable heat outside I always come inside and order a menudo (taste very clean). The staff is always nice and attentive. The lady servers are so pretty, & the gentleman servers are very polite. Would definitely recommend to come and try this place out."}
{"text":"OMG save your money go to Taco Bell. Decided to try Lindo's newest NW location on Tropical. NW area is still lacking good Mexican food. Thought Lindo would be the answer...............Not!.. Decor is nice..Went for lunch. Was promply seated which was good..then things went downhill. Was asked by four people what we wanted to drink..none was our server. Omar was a server..I think he needs to go back to making \"tents\" He could barely speak english and this must of been his 1-2 day on the job. Each thing he did, he needed to check with someone. He needed help taking our simple order. Simple order 2 Tacos and 2 Enchalidas. He couldn't seem to understand that all I wanted was 2 cheese enchilda's. He kept asking me if I wanted beef or chicken. Told him i wanted just cheese,onion and olives. After the second waiter explained it to him he seemed to finally understand. They serve you some chips,salsa and bean dip while your waiting for your order. It's ok, wish the chips were warm. They are very attenative about re-filling your beverage glass, as long as coffer or ice tea. Order arrives..Tacos...rock hard thick shell w/ dried shreded beef..I think the beef was cured in Death Valley. You also get some crispy spanish rice and re-fried beans, actually the same beans as in the bean dip with a spinkling of cheese. Enchaladas. A very garlickly sauce..All the cheese was on the outside, nothing inside..Onions and olives...none. Had to ask for them. When Omar returned he had the onions, but said they didn't have any olives. Which I found a bit strange because I saw them on a taco salad. They try to hustle you out as soon as possible. Removed the utinsils I didn't use from the table, before I was half way thru our meal. Removed the chips,salsa,bean dip when Omar presented us with our check.  Spoke w/ the general manager before I left about our experience. He said he was sorry and would work with our server. But I have no doubt he was just blowing me off. Offered to comp me a future meal. Assured him that was not necessary as I had no intention of ever eating at one of their restaurants again. You'll get more bang for your buck, and better food if you go to Taco Bell...Order a platter meal.."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised at how clean the location is and how easy to find it was! The food was served fast and the staff was very attentive and friendly. Can't go wrong with free chips, salsa and beans!"}
{"text":"Amazing views!!!!! Number one thing. Man but you better have a reservation any night of the week! This place is always packed and for a reason!   Food=amazinggggg. So moist, flavorful and cooked to absolute perfection. I love to get the coca cola pork. Wrapped in their fresh tortillas... Perfection.   Service? Amazing as well. Always refilling my drink and very attentive, yet you don't feel like you're being rushed out of the restraunt.  Ten stars. Love this place."}
{"text":"The place is overall good. The food is good. The service is satisfying. The location is phenomenal, since you have that amazing view of the Las Vegas strip. The only negative thing I could say about this place is that the d√©cor is a bit outdated. Then again, you get that feeling that you're in a true Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fast service and great food. The guacamole table side is so yummy. The menu is huge and there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Definitely a must go to while in Vegas. I rarely eat Mexican food because I get the real, authentic stuff at home from my mom & family, but if I'm ever craving Mexican food in Vegas while partying or visiting friends I always go here. Especially to cure the hangovers. Portions are a great size for the price."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant by far in Vegas. I love how (cliche) the place is decorated inside. The servers are always friendly. Guacamole always made fresh! The Fideo soup prior to your entree always tastes delicious! I love the salsa, beans, and chips they give you to munch on while you wait for your meal. As for the Entrees I always order Enchilada combo or Chicken Fajitas. Always great! And on birthdays it is so much fun! They put a sombrero on you, sing, give you a tequila shot (if you're of age) and dessert. The Churros are a must if you love sweets! They have a live band there and it's a very fun, friendly atmosphere. I always recommend this place and have been going for years :)"}
{"text":"Only because the service was great is why Im giving 3 stars. Brought my friend here from out of town to dinner. She ordered enchiladas and I ordered steak fajitas. Everything was fine until our entrees came. There was a block of rice that was uncooked hard and stuck together. I figured okay I can live with that. Started eating the fajitas. They were great until I got half way into the plate. As I looked down into my food I noticed a few pieces were very pink. I know there are people that like beef cooked there own way but I prefer mine to be well done which this obviously wasnt. Again, the only reason Im being somewhat nice about my rating was because our server was amazing. I didnt even bother with complaining cause he had been on top of everything and didnt want to ruin his night. We tipped him well of course because it wasnt his fault that the food came out the way it did."}
{"text":"Seated up on a hill near Anthem, this location is breathtaking. If you can, avoid the main dining area and get a table near the windows. When I came here it was a beautiful, clear day, so you have an unobstructed view of the city.   When you sit down you are welcomed with a bowl of warm chips, a side of salsa, and refried beans. The chips are addicting and you might be surprised by how fast they go, but do not worry, the staff will refill it for you.  Our server was a little hard to find, but the hostess and busser came to take our drink orders and then refilled them frequently. Two baskets of chips in, our waiter came around to take our order. This normally would not be a problem, but one person was on a lunch break from work. After another twenty to thirty minutes we got our order. If you have the time to wait, this place is good, but avoid if you have a time restraint.  We got cheese enchiladas, carnitas, carnitas burrito, and the steak skewers. The friend who got the enchiladas liked her dish. The carnitas were seasoned well, but some pieces were really dry. I slathered my in salsa and guacamole. My friend who loves carnitas could not finish his. To give you an idea about how much he loves carnitas, he ate them three meals a day for three days straight while on a business trip.  He also said that he wanted to spit a bite out because it was more like chewing gum than meat. The skewers were the best. Moist and tender with gorgeous pieces of peppers and onion. The portion size is enormous, for $15, it is a great deal for two.   Overall, the view is what you are paying for."}
{"text":"I am Hispanic and very picky where I eat Mexican food.  This place is amazing.  Had huevos rancheros and they were very tasty, salsa is fresh. Husband tried torta de carne asada, it was very good too. Can't wait to come again.  Tip... even though the chips, beans, and salsa are sooooo delicious, try to stop yourself because food is worth it."}
{"text":"I found my new favorite dish here...the Camarones Sarandeados Estilo \"Tia Esther\" (18.25$). I had it last night and I can't stop thinking about it. The shrimp were sweet, perfectly cooked in a red sauce with a hint of heat. I also had one of their Javier's Organic Margaritas (10$) on the rocks, I'm usually not a big fan of margaritas but this was delicious. I like their fideo soup, but I add a bit of salsa to it and crush up a few chips, you won't be sorry if you follow my lead. Service was great. It was a bit loud, they had a keyboard playing in the dining room that made it hard to talk, that was my only complaint.  It was our friends birthday so the staff surprised him with a song, some churro a, and a shot. Very cool!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went there the other day.  I ordered the fish taco plate.  Have to say it really had no flavor.  Seems like nothing really had any seasoning.  Fish was bland. The beans had no flavor to them and the rice was just ok.  Had 3 little tacos and for the price that we paid I'm thinking it should have been better."}
{"text":"The food was great and the price was good.  The only few things we disliked here was that there is too much going on and our waiter didn't come once to see how things were, or we needed anything more (which we did), he came at the end of our meal to offer dessert and the check.   We were trying to get his attention but he was too strung out.  So this is what we didn't like, one who puts children near speakers? (children need to be placed away from the DJ and speakers)  The greeters need a little more training on that, a fail on management.  Another fail, from management is the singing of the Happy Birthday to guest. Great idea, but don't take the waiters / waitresses away from their tables.  Keep the help, the food runners, waiters & waitresses doing their job and create another job for other positions there that don't have that big of an impact to your operations.  Such as, your three overwhelming greeters, use two to sing and alternate them as needed. Use the manager walking around as the other singer and that singing DJ too.  Now, you have a team of singers who won't impact your operations as you did before.  The last thing that was just as annoying as everything else failing here was that darn cow .  Are we at the NFR? This is crazy, employees were even cringing when they had to hit it.  It was just too much.  Why at the restaurant? In the middle of the dinning room, what? Good food but the environment needs to be controlled."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with friends, same day reservations are okay and generally fairly accommodating"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely the best! I didn't want to try it out in the first place but I am so happy I did. Even though it was an hour wait (totally worth it), the staff was attentive and fast! It was literally the best staff I have ever encountered. If I had hundreds of dollars to tip them, I would have!   The place was insanely busy and my water was STILL filled 5+ times. Since it was busy, it was noisy but it honestly didn't bother me. The atmosphere was incredibly fun because there was something happening in every corner. Music and \"Happy Birthday\" going off in every corner! We asked them to sing \"Happy Birthday\" to my aunt and a handful came over with a sombrero, put it on her head, started singing, and then gave her little tequila shots! It was the best ever.   I haven't even talked about the AMAZING food yet! It was hands down the best tacos I have ever had in my life. I have shrimp and carne asada tacos. I couldn't get over how delicious it was. The carne asada was perfectly flavored and just melted in my mouth. The shrimp was really to die for. It was also nice that they gave out beans with the chips and salsa.   If you want a relaxing day with amazing meal, I suggest coming on Sunday during lunch. I went again on Sunday after the crazy Friday night and it was more laid back. There was no wait and we had an amazing view of Las Vegas. The view would have been 10000x better at night with those lights but it was still great. The service was still A1. I also tried the ceviche was of course, great. I am weird with seafood but I trusted this place. I'm glad I did.  All in all, try this place out! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"We came to vegas for a quick vacations and my friend already told me about this place so we decided to give them a try. Customer service was great ! And the food was really good my husband had chile verde and I had carnitas. It was delicious! I really recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this place after reading all of the reviews. The fist thing was that the floors were greasy and slippery. We had to hold on to the chairs so we didn't fall. The staff there didn't seem to mind the slickness. The second thing was the food was over cooked and mine was burnt. The service was good, The margaritas were also good. But I will never return there."}
{"text":"Call me non-traditional but my last 2 visits were Valentines Day and St. Patrick's day.  I can't wait for the next holiday!!  Great food, extremely friendly and helpful service.  Can't beat the view for a Henderson location."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what happened to this place. This chain use to be the best spot in Vegas to satiate a Mexican craving. It is now rated, in my opinion, under Taco Bell. I use to frequent this restaurant at least once a month, but this year my visits dwindled to twice. After the trip tonight, hoping it could redeem itself, I will not be going back. The salsa was awful, it had a very metallic flavor, and even though my husband and I ordered 2 compliantly different dishes ( chili Colorado and taco salad) they both tasted exactly the same. Bland and flavorless. I sat there at the table trying my best to stomach my salad, adding the table side guacamole, salt, pepper, anything and everything I could (not the salsa) and nothing I did helped. It all tasted exactly like NOTHING (with salt and pepper). I honestly don't have any idea why they have gone from awesome to awful, but I will most certainly never be going back."}
{"text":"We have visited this location at least thirty time and each time, we are amazed by the food, the staff and the experience!    I love the chicken tacos and my wife enjoys garlic chicken.  The have a real good selection of Mexican beer, my favorite is Carta Blanca."}
{"text":"We frequent the Lindo Michoac√°n Restaurant in Henderson and have always enjoyed the overall dinning experience.  I will tell you this location is as equal in quality of food and service!  The dinning room is always buzzing with the smell of fresh, exciting food and people enjoying the Food, Margaritas  and Music.  I love the rolled tacos and the shrimp Cocktails and the service is the best.  All three locations have been outstanding and I would recommend them to anyone, who enjoys Mexican food......  A must when traveling to Las Vegas, Henderson or North Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"We had a outstanding meal, the Flatas were great, they have several mexican beers to pick from and the people are always nice.   We will be headed back to see them."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Really reminds me of TexMex from back home.  Had the cheese enchiladas which had an great mild red sauce.  Rice & beans were great also.  Started with a michelada, which came in a nice big glass with the chili salt rim.  Perfect for a Saturday lunch.  Get a table by the giant panoramic window, it has a great view of Henderson all the way to the Strip."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD GREAT VIEW SLOOOOOOOOOOOW SERVICE (which is why not 5 star)  Came with the family last night. I've eaten here many times before. Never had any complaints.  FOOD: Absolutely delicious! The food was definitely some of the best Mexican food I've eaten. No complaints at all.  SERVICE: We were promptly seated and our drink orders were taken. The waiter disappeared for 20 minutes before he took our food order. Food came quick. After we were finished the bus boys cleared the table. It took the waiter 30 minutes to bring the check!  Like I said I've eaten here quite a few times and never had such slow service. 20 minutes to take a food order and 30 minutes to get a check is simply not acceptable in the food service biz. The waiter was nice though but just real slow."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic food, great service...prices are reasonable. The salsa and bean dip are the best!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this Lindo about 5 times.  I have never been disappointed.  I usually order the Pollo Sarandeados with flour tortillas.  It is always good.  I cut up the chicken, put it in the flour tortillas with some guac, rice, and salsa - it is awesome.  The chips are always good.  The bean dip is spot on - good flavor and always warm.  I tried my daughter's quesadilla this time -  she loved it and I thought it had a good flavor.   The atmosphere is inviting - large and spacious.  The service is always friendly.  And, they had the basketball game on tonight - bonus.   I will continue to return.  This is a great place for dinner."}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas you need to come here for the best Mexican food and the service is excellent prices are very affordable and food delicious"}
{"text":"Great guacamole, margaritas, and fajitas were delicious.   Bday parties get tequila shots!!!"}
{"text":"My friend Eric wanted some GOOD Mexican food, so I introduced him to Lindo!  We asked to sit by the window, and as always, the obliged.  Manny, and Juan were the BEST!  They impressed my friend SO MUCH that he can't wait to return!  The food quality, and service is always high.  This place never misses!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in town! My husband and I eat here about twice a month. Every time we go I try something new but my husband loves the Camarones Abuelito Timo so much he always orders it. Our favorite waiter Renee doesn't even ask him what he wants, he just knows. I have loved everything I have tried at Lindo. The views are fabulous, the food is beyond your typical Americanized Mexican food. The drinks are great, superb service, the live music always awesome, and some nights there is a great Mariachi band. Expect to wait for a table but who cares, it's worth it. Order a margarita, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went here last night... Usually every time I've gone it's been great!  Not this time, we walked In around 9 pm after I got off work. We were seated promptly and in a nice booth, while we waited for maybe 8 min I noticed the time because I had been watching my phone.... Then the manager walks by noticed we were still waiting thanks to him, Nestor came to our table. Let me say this server had no personality we were greeted with \"do you want a drink?\" We order two Cadillac margaritas ($10 each) he brought out the drinks... \"Do you want to order?\"  Sure can we start out with the guacamole!  Now I assume that table side guac would include some sort if conversation other then just \"how spicy do you want?\"   Nope not for us that night... After he finishes mixing our guac he places it on the table next to our chips and salsa that were brought to the table while we waited on a server to come to the table... So by now we have less then half of our chips. One would think that when you order a app of guacamole you would get more chips? Next Nestor wants us to order  with his over the top \"do you want to order now?\" Sure I say because by now I'm over him and his lack of service skills lets just order... We both order and my boyfriends food comes correct but looks like a microwaved set of chips and cheese with dry (ill guess had been sitting in a third pan in a steam table all night) chicken with canned jalape√±o that they call nachos! Great I ordered 2 chicken tacos that came with soup rice and beans... I received    2 chicken tacos on a plate.... Nothing else lucky for me the food runner brought out out food and I quickly let him know I was missing half of my order... He was really nice about it and said he would fix it (I wish he was my server at least he cared about what was going on at the table!).  The only time we got to see our server again was 1 while he stood in the middle if the dinning room watching the game highlights on the tvs or 2 when he came by to say \"want another drink?\" Never to ask how was our meal was or would you like dessert?? Nothing it had to be the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant!!!  My boyfriend always has a sweet tooth so I really wanted to order him a dessert... But when the bill was just dropped off at the table I was over it! All in all my bill was 75 dollars I have never left a server less then 20% EVER but this was the worst night ever I left him $10 and that was being nice... i wanted to write on the bill what i thought about the service but really thought would he even care???  I was so mad with the evening we left to go to smiths to buy wine and dessert since we both had a horrible experience I assumed I would have a better time at home! Should have picked up Roberto's and made my own guac and drinks at home! At least I would have had a great dinner and would have saved money...."}
{"text":"From the beginning to the end was absolutely the worst service I have ever received EVER extremely disappointed ! We sat down after about 5 mins the waiter came by to take out drink order I'm a sucker for a yummy Michalada but that's not what I got I got a glass with ice and lime and a bottle of beer on the side (which was left untouched) the we order our food I ordered the chicken salad in a tortilla shell and husband ordered a shrimp ceviche salad (looked awesome) so after the food arrived my dressing was left out so after 10-15mins I was able to get the attention of a waiter to have him bring it out! So disappointed with the lack of customer service ! I usually enjoy this place but what a waste of 50.00$ this visit was! Maybe if the waiters paid attention to paying customers instead of chatting he could have seen how disappointing this experience was !!"}
{"text":"Food and service was great. Was kinda cramped. Small space. Once again food was very good!"}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" place for great Mexican food. Even on those days when they're crowded, the wait is never more then 15 minutes. Take that time to enjoy a margarita at the bar - delicious. Table side guacamole is a must. It's hard to pick a favorite, but their beef chimichanga is definitely one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Food here is good, their consistency is not that good. Tonight the food was fresh, had very tender pork in my burrito, my husband's steak very thin but had decent grill flavor.   Service was good, maragrita was very good. Music started just as we finished."}
{"text":"This place opens at 9am and I am hungry, so we head out for some good Mexican food.  The service is great, considering we one of a couple of tables, this early, not too many people here.   I get my order in for a combination plate, I think it's called Patzcuaro, it included a chile relieno, one tamale, Green chicken enchilada and sour cream with onions.  The chips and salsa are very fresh, the chips are warm, the salsa and bean dip is very spicy.  And they offer a refill!  We get a small cup of soup, with noodle, hot but needs a little kick, so I add some of the salsa on the table.  The food comes out pipping hot and the cheese all melted the way I like it.  A very good meal.  The food is fresh, the service is great and they are open early."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Super busy but the staff full of professionals. My margaritas were delicious with just the right salt. The server brought me especial salsa that was great. A nice bean dip too. Taco served in a little steel holder to keep it hot. The chimi was full of meat and not soggy or greasy. And did I mention the staff-the best! My new go to place when I come to Vegas or Henderson!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food and amazing atmosphere! I ordered the burrito/tamale combo, and it was great! Would come back for more Mexican food."}
{"text":"I've been here before this time I came with a few friends & my kids . Both my boys ordered their food , my friends . We all got our food & one of my boys got his food which was a torta with no meat. I flagged the waiter and told him it took a while then we told him to just make us a quesadilla like my other son had ordered . Well they brought him his quesadilla AGAIN no meat!!!!! Second time at this point I was irritated. I told Javier again. He took it and a few minutes later came back with the new plate which was suppose to be a quesadilla with asada. Well AGAIN, NO MEAT! t the end of our meal I asked them for a discount for the inconvenience my son had to deal with during his meal. Well guess what ..... the manager was told of the inconvenience and only decided to give me 10% of my sons meal which was 1.05$!!!!!!!!! Annoyed basically they made me feel like I don't matter as a customer . Oh well my food was wrong and it don't matter if it's not ur fault ! I will think twice before I come back here again! I gave them 2 stars because the other staff did make a effort. What's 1.05$ off your meal when you keep getting the order wrong !"}
{"text":"This was the worst mexican food in Las Vegas.. second time here wanted to give it a second chance. Had the Carnitas, dried out and crunchy, rice was bland and the beans tasted like canned. Cost was good but could have gone to Robertos for the same price and had better quality of food. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food, drinks, and atmosphere of Lindo. Unfortunately, there have been occasional visits where the service has not been up to par. Coming at non peak hours is your obvious option to increase your chances of getting better service.  As far as food, my suggestion is not to order the typical taco, burrito, enchilada, or fajita. You can find these items down the street in either direction, or hell, you can make them at home. I try and order a specialty dish which is usually a unique take that I haven't had or is not as common.  On the our most recent visit, our party of 7 had a reservation at 7 PM and were not seated at our corner window table until 7:20 with our order not being taken until 7:40. My cadillac margarita was served in a daiquiri glass which was interesting. Everything smoothed out after our order was placed.  The shrimp ceviche could have used a little more kick with more jalapeno. I think a bead of sweat is forming on my brow as I type that I had the camaron a la diabla. If you like spicy, this is the dish for you. We finished with some fried ice cream and that was OK. I've had about half of the beef dishes and have been pleased with all of them. Most of the specialty dishes range from $15-$20 and come with fideo soup, rice, beans, and tortillas."}
{"text":"I have pretty much been to all of the Lindo Michoacan locations in Las Vegas and this one tops all of them based on location/view!  It's amazing! The view is a beautiful skyline of the Las Vegas Strip.    As for service, our busser Angel was a bit more active than our waiter in terms of ordering.  The Dessert Inn location seriously has it down when it comes to overall service.  As for the food, the salsa, beans, and chips are something you must watch out for if you plan to eat your main course!  The salsa combined with the beans has just the right amount of heat that you lose yourself in them, and the busser just keeps them coming.  The tomatoe based fideo soup served before the main course is also good.  It reminds me of my moms.  I normally stick with Camarones Abuelito Timo, I was happy to see that the flavor is consistent between the other restaurants.  bacon wrapped, cheese covered shrimp, with a delicious mayo/Tabasco aioli....can't go wrong with bacon!  Overall the location, food, and environment is great!"}
{"text":"I would give it a 0 star is I could! I spent more than$400 gambling not including our dinner tab and the manager would buy us 3 drinks because we stopped gambling. It seems as though you would be better off putting in $100 and nickel and diming the machine all night. I will not ever visit the bar here again. No wonder there are no customers visiting this bar. They do not get taken care of!!"}
{"text":"Excellent mexican food. I go for the tacos, soup and Ronaritas. I always order the lengua tacos, it comes with three tacos, beans and rice. They bring out chips with salsa and beans which is delicious. Its pretty quiet and the staff provides excellent service. Sometimes they can be a little much because everyone will ask you if you need anything every time they pass. It can be a little annoying but at least you aren't neglected the whole meal. Haven't tried the bar area but its worth checking out if you want a good mexican restaurant that's authentic."}
{"text":"Been Mexican, I give them 1 star food was awful, this use to be a good place to eat at .they change cooks!!! Service is terrible our waiter today Sunday December 22 of 2013 ,Irving took our money and then came back acting innocent asking if we wanted our change back this is low, I can't believe we got Jack at this place!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really good food but had to wait 30 minutes to get the check after I was done eating than a further 30 before it was picked up and charged. Might have just been busy but still that was ridiculous."}
{"text":"We used to frequent this place... at least once a week.  I will never willingly return. The food has slid so far downhill that it's not the same restaurant.  The waitstaff, with the exception of a couple waiters, is poor at best. They messed something up on our order the last 4 times we went. The manager is unapologetic, and always had some lame excuse. Also, not that he has to, but if I managed a restaurant and saw a couple come in week in and week out, I'd buy them a drink every so often. Never once happened. The other Place, Viva Michoacan near Sunset and Sunset is way better. Worth the drive when I could walk to Lindo.  update:  we we t back, and the food and service has been remarkably better. Good job, Lindo!!  4 stars."}
{"text":"The place is extremely busy on a Friday evening.  After waiting almost an hour for a table we were waited on fairly quickly.  The food was good and service adequate.  But the atmosphere was very noisy and hard to talk."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and each time I leave with my tummy satisfied. Service is great but the menu items are kinda pricy. But their lunch specials are a bargain with a good amount of food. I love everything I tried and portions are more than enough. The thing that keeps me coming back is the table side guacamole. It's so fresh and seasoned just right."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, variety of food, excellent service. I consider it one of my favorite Mexican food restaurant. Also if there is a happy hour the remind you, not like other restaurants... I keep going back whenever I feel Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I enjoyed the customer service!! We had hector as our waiter and he was very helpful and welcoming. It was my sisters birthday and she very much enjoyed the mariachi band and food. The place was very crowded and busy so I would recommend setting a reservation in advance. We had the patio window seats and there was a gorgeous view of the strip. Overall good was great and I love the atmosphere and energy."}
{"text":"We got seated right away and even got a choice of booth or table. We chose the booth. As we started to look over the menu a waiter brought the kids some soup which was awesome because they were very hungry. Shortly after they took our drink order and brought us  chips with beans and salsa. Drinks came out and I quickly drank the cup empty. The drink waiter came by and refilled my cup and brought us out another bowl of chips because we had wiped those out fast also. The chip/drink waiter (Fernando) was on point with his refills. He was awesome. We ordered our food and shortly after we got our soup. That little bowl of soup is so good. It wasn't long after we had finished our soup that our food came out. I ordered the chili Colorado. The meat was so tender and the meal was so delicious. It's definitely my go to meal when I don't know what to get. My wife got the enslada marinera. It was very good. It was a nice light dish that reminded me of ceviche. I think that might have to be my second go to dish."}
{"text":"Use to love this place but then they changed the salsa.  So I now I have to travel to the desert inn location."}
{"text":"Love this place. The husband and i frequent here and always enjoy ourselves. Great atmosphere, great food, and awesome service. I love their margaritas and the chills and salsa come with bean dip without being asked. Really, this place is great and i don't know why it took me so long to review"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years, and it's always good. Even on the craziest busiest day Mothers Day it was insane in here but they kept it together as a team. I didn't get a chance to write a review so doing it now. They need more stars for their customer service! Food always fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"Just ate here tonight with my family and I have to say it was one of the most pleasant dining experiences I've had in some time.  The food was good. I don't know if any one item really blew me away but the food from top to bottom was satisfying. I had the combination plate with a chile relleno, chicken enchilada and a tamale. The tamale, which was actually the reason I ordered the plate was probably the weakest thing I hate, but it was more than made up for by a good enchilada and very, very good chile relleno.  For desert we had the fried ice cream and, my favorite dish of the night, sopapillas. Both were delicious.  Now, having mentioned the food, I want to say that the part of the outing that made my night was the service. I've had plenty of good food at plenty of places--it's really not hard to find in Las Vegas. Finding a place that makes you feel great on a Saturday night purely by the strength of the service though? That's a lot harder.  Everyone who waited on us was smiling, prompt and very nice. Our bussers key our waters full and our tables clear. Our orders arrived quickly and everyone was particularly nice and interactive with our baby. If fact, during the course of the meal a lady brought us a stuffed burro from the restaurant and gave it to us. It entertained our daughter long enough for me to finish dinner.  I hope this evening was not an anomaly because I'm looking forward to this same treatment when I return. It really set this place apart and really made for a nice Saturday evening."}
{"text":"I'd write more but I'm so happily stuffed at the moment! I had the carnitas mexicana and couldn't leave any behind - although I usually don't take left overs home because I never eat them. I'm planning on eating the rest as soon as I get remotely hungry again.  The service was quick, to the point, yet very thorough. I wish I had gotten our servers name because he was working his tail off. You can tell the staff works hard to accommodate you and they stay on top of the drink refills. Make sure to get the table side guacamole!!   Can't wait to go back and take visiting family members there. I definitely recommend this  restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding. Great food and even better views. We watched a lightning storm from the huge window that runs along the entire rear of the restaurant and overlooks the Vegas Valley. The nice hostess even arranged tables for us so we could sit near the window. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for Mexican in the desert! #lindomichoacan makes your guacamole table side while you gaze at the Las Vegas Strip from their balcony!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the welcoming atmosphere, the salsa, beans and Fideo soup was a treat too. We were in for the soups and could have been a little more home style/ authentic although it was still good. Will be back to try out more stuff."}
{"text":"Great view. Service is a bit slow but the food was good. Its menus has some very different combinations from restaurants in California. I have been back 4 times and will go back again. Just chill and enjoy the view in the evening."}
{"text":"It's Cinco de Mayo and this place is loud as hell . the food tonight was terrible chili Colorado was as bitter as could be. I like this place, but after tonight's food I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"It's just not very good, it used to be better but never was really good. I remember when it opened and what a big success it was immediately. I never understood why it was so popular, it's what I call a 10 year restaurant. That's a place where I eat and don't really like the food; then after 10 years of people telling me how good it is, I think maybe I missed something. So I try it again and am reminded why I did not like it the first time, 10 years ago.  We ate here again recently because it was open late. The meal was disappointing as usual, nothing was terrible but nothing was good either. We only ate about half of our meals and did not get containers to take the leftovers home. It's kind of pricey also, about $100 for two, definitely not worth the money.  Las Vegas is not a great town for Mexican restaurants like LA or San Antonio are; tacos yes but restaurants not so much. There are however two places in this same part of town that are far superior and cheaper than Lindo Michoacan. El Ausente and Hacienda del Rey are much better choices and better values as well."}
{"text":"Overpriced Mexican food... I've been to at least 3 of their restaurants thinking it was a \"location\" issue, but no!  It is themed after Mexican border towns.  With bright/busy colors, and \"Adelitas\" dressed female staff... a look that is far from current Mexico.   The food is geared more for bland palettes... A little better than a taco truck because it is served on an actual plate. But, the food quality isn't superior to warrant their premium menu pricing.   Chevy's restaurant (although Tex-Mex) has a more authentic feel and taste!    I'm rating 2 stars only because, they represent another option in town and the other for effort.    They are known for their margaritas, but nothing you haven't had before in any Mexican resort.   After going to 3 different locations of theirs (Including the one in Green Valley) this restaurant only gives their patrons a false a sense of status, but is lacking major points in food quality, service, food temperatures (SNHD) and overall experience of the place.   GM's take notes and hope you welcome constructive criticism to make your place a better option in town."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about how awesome this place is. What a great experience. The hosts and wait staff, the food, the decor, the mariachi band. Everything was really great. What a welcome break from the strip. Next time I'm in Vegas, I will absolutely be going here."}
{"text":"Let's start with the service from Antonio....not good. He was disinterested and when we asked him to recommend something he have us a blank state.  Food wasn't good. Neither of ate all of it or even half and didn't want to take it with us. Both of us got chicken, enchiladas with mole for me and tacos for my husband. The chicken was soooooooo dry I couldn't even chew it. We got table side guacamole made with ONE avocado but was $8.50."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location in a LONG TIME! I tend to frequent the one on Carnegie in Henderson or the one that's less than 5 minutes from my house in Summerlin.  Place was packed on a Friday night, and there seemed to be an overwhelming number of people celebrating their birthdays this night!  The food was good. I ordered the vegetarian burritos and they were awesome! The server was pretty good too. Paid good attention to how we were behaving at the table. Checking on us quickly in the beginning, but noticed we were too busy conversing so switched to checking on us every ten minutes or so. I also think he had a thing for my date, as he never really looked at me when he came to check on us! lol! All good. Just shows he has good taste!  All in all, a great experience and I would eat here again, but have to be honest when I say I'd go to Carnegie or West Flamingo locations first. Nothing against this location, just my preference of area and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Have been here several times. Good food always busy but very efficient friendly staff. Great location"}
{"text":"So now that I am the second one to review the Cinco De Mayo Massacre I will sail away in the boat of Asshole with Matthew C. I understand Cinco De Mayo is like a national holiday for drinking and eating lard filled Mexican food but holy frijoles this place was ridiculous.  As far as I know one of our fearless leaders called and made prior arrangements for seating for our group. Well, by the looks of it, they reserved the waiting area for us and forgot that we wanted to eat.    My night started off crappy after standing at the bar trying to get the attention of the ladies working the bar for about 20 minutes before leaving the bar empty handed and frustrated. We then finally got seated and the waiter asked us what we wanted to drink... We ordered  Margaritas in hope we would be put into a Tequila Coma and that was not the case.. It was like pounding a bottle of Margarita mix hold the tequila.   Next Misti Y.  was awesome enough to hook the table up with the table side guac, and I happened to be sitting with a group of other \"Hot and Spicy\" fans so we asked for our bowl to be HOT.... I think they took the lead of the person making the margaritas and kept out the main ingredient. Jalapeno.   So by this point it was damn near Seis De Mayo and they took our order. We all put our orders in at the same time and i will say that all the food came out quickly... Well almost all the food... Matt C. was sitting to my right with nothing on the table in front of him. we all tried to get the attention of the waiters and when they finally listened to us, we said,\" he did not get his food\" the waiter said okay let me go get it. About 10 minutes later we had to stop him again and this time he had to ask Matt what he had ordered and basically started this process all over again.. Horrible!!!!  Yes, I did open the door for them to earn another star back from us in which they did, but I am glad Matthew C. did not end up with a chipped tooth or something worse.   I will not be back to this location... Esto era horrible y nunca voy a estar de vuelta"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends after an extremely long weekend of drunken debauchery on the Strip. It was a Sunday morning and not too busy yet. We were seated right away and offered drinks. I desperately tried to avoid more alcohol but they suckered me into ordering a mimosa. I tried to convince myself that I only ordered it 'cause you get a complimentary drink (sangria, margarita, or champagne) when you order their brunch buffet. The mimosa was fresh and yummy.   The brunch buffet was $12.95 which includes the free drink and chips & salsa. The chips also came with a bean dip which was quite tasty. The menudo and posole were delicious. Rice and beans were great. Tortillas are handmade and served piping hot with your meal.  The staff was friendly and attentive. They seemed as if they actually enjoyed their job.  The bathrooms were clean and they smelled wonderful. I don't know what air freshener they use but it is divine.    I took one star off 'cause this place is pretty far from the Strip but worth the extra effort. Additionally, I noticed that there was a sign on the front window that said that they had been voted the \"Best of Vegas\" award for two years. That can't be a bad thing right?  I loved the fact that all the servers wore shirts that said,\"Save water, Drink margaritas!\" Definitely my kind of place..."}
{"text":"I went to Lindo Michoac√°n for the first and last time two nights ago. I had heard good and not so good things about this restaurant and decided to try it for myself. The queso fundido was horrible; a big glob of melted cheese with some chiles thrown in. We had to CUT the dip and plop it on tortillas to eat it. Not a good start. My shrimp dish was mundane at best and my rice was filled with Lima beans. Our waiter was inattentive, acting as though we were an inconvenience. The only person that was awesome was our busboy, who was not only helpful answering questions, but also made sure that we were taken care of at every turn. I am BAFFLED by the fact that this restaurant is consistently named Best of Las Vegas every year. I can overlook a mediocre meal but bad service I cannot. I will not be back and will not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a family member and decided to check it out... my mother was born in Michoac√°n so this place had a lot to live up to... this place did not disappoint!!! I almost wanted to get up and check the kitchen to see if they hired my mom!!! It took me back to my childhood it was so great!!! In fact i came back the next day for breakfast!!!   Also shoutout to Pablo!!!! He served us both days and I can't say enough great things about him!!! He made sure our drinks and bellies were always full and fed!!! I will come back when I'm in town!!! Thank you Pablo for being the best of what Lindo Michoac√°n is all about!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food - i ordered the cheese enchiladas verdes. Yumm!! We had a party of 30 - staff was friendly and attentive. The mariachi group was really good!"}
{"text":"This is the second time i come to this restaurant while visiting Vegas. This time i had the carnitas plate. Crisp, moist and flavorfull. It came with rice, beans and chile toreados (grilled jalapeno peppers). You also have a choice of flour or corn tortillas. I got a free desert just for doing their survey. The food came out fast and the staff is very friendly, a plus. Overall, i wod definitely return."}
{"text":"We are still looking for a decent Mexican restaurant as this one failed to convince us:  Firstly, there is way too much food served. As we anticipated this already, we didn't order an appetizer. Nevertheless we all were stuffed way beyond the point of satisfaction. I prefer quality over quantity. And, yes the quality was mediocre. There are way better Mexican restaurants out there.   The location with its nice view over the valley, however, is great! I just wish the eating experience would match with the high-end location."}
{"text":"Service is ok. Food was just ok. Nothing special about the chips & salsa. Margarita was the highlight of the meal. Had steak Ranchera & fajitas. We came on a Friday night, so it was expectedly busy. Unfortunately, management elected to have a large party in the dining room. It sounded like Chuck E Cheese. 8-11 year old children running through the dining room with absolutely no regard for the other patrons. Not one server or employee said a word to the party (which isn't surprising when they're charging an automatic gratuity). Conversation across the table was impossible because it was so loud. Total let down as we'd heard decent things about this place and we enjoy Mexican food."}
{"text":"Oh how I desperately want to love this place....but I don't. In my opinion the food is subpar and the service lacks. I've given it many chances thinking I didn't order the right thing or service was just off that day. Nope. After about 5 visits I can officially say that I'm still in search of good Mexican food in Henderson. I gave it 2 stars because the view is amazing and I haven't gotten food poisoning there."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes and was so excited to try this place. First experience was on a Monday night and they were hoppin'. Live music and all. Service was good but my meal lacked. I thought it was perhaps my menu choice so I gave it a second shot. Yet again I was disappointed in my food. Always love good chips and salsa pre-meal which they have. Good atmosphere, especially if you're with a group. But sad to report that I was dissatisfied with the taste of the food. I will say they have an amazing view."}
{"text":"This location is AMAZING. This place gets packed and even though it's huge sometimes you have to wait a few minutes to get seated.   I made reservations for a Saturday near the big window because good food+good drinks+good company+good view= extremely special dinner. The few times I've been here I've received good service. The waiters have been attentive and frequently checking on us. Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"Good food service was fast, different then any other Mexican place they was busy as hell but they staff always stop by , hope the fix the soda machine was Lil flat"}
{"text":"Good authentic salty Mexican food.  I've tried multiple items on the menu and they don't disappoint.  Gotta get a Cadillac margarita while Ur at it..."}
{"text":"I love the decor, and all the hostess's are dressed up in really pretty Mexican skirts and blouses. I can't quite name a favorite dish, but so far every thing ive tried here is awesome. So if you have never been here or your visiting Las Vegas PLEASE try this place!!! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This place is the worst. They take reservations and then you arrive and they refuse to honor it and say it's an hour wait for walk ins."}
{"text":"I reviewed this place about 3 years ago and my opinion has not changed. Still a great restaurant that excels in service.  Staff highly attentive, and really liked the three young lady greeters at front in regional dress.  Food of course great and varied.  We have a condo in Vegas and visit 4 or 5 times a year and this is often our default go to place.  Avoid it at Mexican Independence day though.  Real crowded with large groups and service suffers a bit."}
{"text":"Excellent service, large menu, very friendly staff and very popular place so be prepared for crowds and raucous noise.  Best fish tacos ever, melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"A friend from work highly recommended this place and you know what, he was right.  Original Lindo Michoacan was fantastic!  Our waiter quickly brought our drinks and some complimentary hot chips, salsa and bean dip while we looked over the menu.  Now while I could have gotten full just eating those wonderfully hot chips and dip, I had to stop myself from eating them all up so I could save room for all the other food we ordered.  We went with the Queso Fundido with Chorizo, the Enchilada Tarasca and some Carnitas a la Mexicana.    Omg the food was glorious!  Super flavorful, filling and tasty.  I only wish I could have eaten more.  The Queso Fundido was the most deliciously gooey combination of cheese and spices.  I wish every day I could eat me some of that cheesy goodness.  And yes I do love cheese that much.  Then my lunch special that included an enchilada filled with cheese, beef and chicken ... drool worthy.    Everything and I do mean everything I tasted was delicious.  In fact I was only planning on eating half of my food and taking the other half to go to eat later, but that didn't happen.  The food here was just too good.  My friend, who is a pretty picky Mexican food lover, absolutely devoured all of his as well.  We both thouroughly enjoyed eating here.   I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm really puzzled by all the good reviews...the food was about a 2 or 3 on a scale of 1-10. Party of four, nobody was happy. Everything overcooked, really cheap ingredients (chicken, shrimp), the mole sauce was runny and watery, the soup had zero flavor! I will say that whoever is making the salsa should be promoted to head chef. That was only thing that was good. Run of the mill Margaritas, just some mix and very little cheap tequila. It's a shame because everybody was nice. Really disappointing. Cannot for the LIFE of me understand all the food channel references...will not return for sure. Was tempted to give it a 1."}
{"text":"If you want authentic, delicious mexican food, look no further!  As a central California native, I am extremely spoiled with my mexican food. After moving to vegas and trying numerous places, I finally came here to see if this would finally satisfy my need for \"real\" mexican food.  To say I was impressed is an understatement. They are always packed, but the waits are never too long, and the overall experience is worth the wait.  Their chips, salsa and bean dip are perfect. Their servers and wait staff are attentive and great at their jobs.  The food, to die for. They have an extensive menu that leaves nothing out. The shrimp cocktail is delightful, the guacamole, which they prepare table side, is impeccable, and their entrees on point.  Jordan loves the filet rellano,  which is orange roughy stuffed with seafood and battered accompanied with beans and rice. I favor the fajitas and the veggie enchiladas. You can't go wrong!!!"}
{"text":"Love the bean dip. Love the Pollo con Rajas y Crema! Really good food all around. Really cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, atmosphere and food. Servers were so friendly and went out of their way to happily accommodate. Hard to find good service like that these days. Will def be coming back, thank you :)"}
{"text":"I guess I am use to Southeastern style Mexican food. This food was very bland, it taste like it had NO seasoning. I had to add Salt and Pepper to give it flavor. The salsa was a smoke style salsa but it taste burned to me."}
{"text":"We've been going here for the past 5 years, but the service has gone downhill for about the past year, they seem to have gone to all waiters, which is fine I guess, but they all have attitudes as though they are doing you a favor by serving you- Extremely rude and unprofessional service. The food is only OK, a bit bland for my taste, there are enough Mexican Joints in Vegas, won't be putting up with the snippy little bitch waiters."}
{"text":"So for the past 5 years my family and I have literally lived 5 minutes from this location, passed by it at least 5 times per week, always heard great things yet decided to go for the first time today. Needless to say that we have been missing out!   Great parking setup despite the location (tight commercial area near DI and Eastern) and wonderful and authentic atmosphere inside. Traditional attire, non-obtrusive and traditional music over the speaker and a live Mariachi band that stopped through to provide an awesome performance.   The service was awesome and it really felt like we had two waiters since we kept getting effective follow-up from the staff. The entire experience felt like the popular El Cholo restaurants in Los Angeles...but with better pricing, selections and food portions. Speaking of selections I was shocked to see almost 10 or more entree selections for EVERY meat group (seafood, fish chicken, beef and pork). I chose the Fajitas de Res.....BUT had to get a to-go box immediately since I got full from the unlimited chips and salsa and multiple Cadillac Margaritas lol  Overall, this is our definite go-to authentic Mexican food restaurant from now on."}
{"text":"Great view, Great food & Great service. Highly recommend for families or couples. This place has delicious Mexican food that is the closest to real on this side of town. Prices are decent and affordable. Margaritas are yummy."}
{"text":"Stop by this place on a Saturday night.  The place was nice, the atmosphere was good, and our waiter was on top of our refills.    The bad, our waiter took our order but forgot to place it to the cook, so it took about 20mim to finally get our food.  When our food finally came out, my plate was totally the wrong plate.  At this point the waiter and manager offer to get me what I had order but I did not feel like waiting another 10-20 min for the plate I had originally order.   I would try it again but this night I left very disappointed that I did not get the food I order."}
{"text":"Free Chips with Bean and Salsa dip.  The food is great and plentiful for the price.  Service has always been good and consistent."}
{"text":"Everyone was so friendly and the food was delicious! They give you chips and salsa with refried beans and a little bowl of this amazing soup. All for free before you even get your meal. Will definitely be coming back here next time I'm in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"This has to be the best (Mexican) restaurant around. Amazing Mexican food....I know I'm from back east but it's really good stuff!"}
{"text":"LOVE everything about this place from their bean dip, salsa to their entrees!  Don't forget to get the Cadillac Margarita!"}
{"text":"Very poor service, mediocre food.  Cadillac Margarita was made with plastic bottle tequila @ $13.00 each. Margarita had no flavor nor color of having used premium ingredients. Menu stated use of Premium Anejo tequila grand Marnier. When arrived at table .o color, and no flavor of either premium ingredient. Chilli rellenlohad no flavor"}
{"text":"Let's examine this place on a number of differnet levels.  THE FOOD  I would call it above average mexican style food.  They did have an extensive menu with some authentic dishes.  I am only one guy so I tried a combo plate for a little variety.  The Chile rellano was actually pretty decent, not quite homemade, but very good.  The other diners in my group were all very happy with their food.  The entire meal was well prepared.  THE SERVICE  I think this is what seperates this place.  The service is very good.  It is fast with out anyone trying to hurry you up.  Plenty of refills and they remove plates, bottles, ect... promptly.  There seemed to be a sincere welcome felling - as if you went to persons home...  THE VENUE  This place has been in the same spot for some time.  It has a bar with 3 seperate dining areas.  It is plenty big enough.  It had a charm to it - they didn't over do it or try to hard.  Very homey.  The place appeared to be very clean too.    THE INTANGIBLES  The restaurant was jam packed full of Mexicans.  I was even dining with Mexicans.  My logic is if the Mexicans like it then it must be good.  Not that they are culinary experts but they do know something about mexican food.  The place just has a good vibe to it.  It feels like a mexican restaurant.  Also, It is locally owned and operated."}
{"text":"Next time you're in Las Vegas try to stop by this place. Very excellent service and food is great! They are listed on the AAA AUTO CLUB site under discounts but they will not honor it. Last visit the waiter did not even know what AAA auto club was. He asked the owner that was present and owner refused. **** I will still give a 5 star because this is always a great experience here****"}
{"text":"So I have been to this eatery 3 Times now , and I can not give it more then a one star  As the services is fabulous, the food is below average.    I am not a Mexican food fan, but I go when I am requested too, I have tried a few dishes to include basic tacos , and they can't even get those right.   Very bland tasting meat and rice.     I will say my counter part ordered oysters and she did say they were delicious, but how can you mess up raw oysters :)   They do not have reservations, which is a huge downfall on a weekend."}
{"text":"What could I possibly say about this place that hasn't been said already?? This place is simply WONDERFUL! I am truly a sucker for any place that serves bean dip along with your chips & salsa! I've been to this location twice now and have enjoyed every minute of it. Everything is excellent - The food, the service, the decor, the drinks, you name it! I ordered the Birria de Chivo which was absolutely delicious. I had a strawberry margarita to drink which was excellent as well. Will definitely be coming here again when I'm in Vegas again! LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow.    Prices aren't the cheapest, but I guarantee this will be some of the best Mexican food you've had in a while.   I had the Pollo Asado burrito, which was awesome!   Our waiter (can't remember his name!!!) was awesome!   He had a great sense of humor with us drunk folk and gave us flawless service."}
{"text":"Let me start with the view, it is SPECTACULAR.  it is the best view of the valley in the city.  Ask for a table on the lower level if they have one available. You won't regret it.    The food is always good and there is plenty of it.  Two of our favorites are the red snapper and the chili verde.  The red snapper is flash fried and available with a variety of sauces.  The chili verde is tender and well seasoned.   The chips are fresh and crispy.  The salsa is spicy and just darn good.  Whenever we have friends in town this is a must visit for us."}
{"text":"customer service was mediocre at best, mole was spicy but lacked flavor overall, chicken was dry and rice was not on point. The best thing about the restaurant is the view and selection of tequila. Would not come back."}
{"text":"We always love the food and the service. The food  is delicious, authentic Mexican and the nachos are especially unbeatable. I love how the staff sing you \"happy birthday\" whenever it's someone's birthday, plus they have us make a wish and enjoy churros. A gem of politeness, friendliness and amazing food in what can sometimes be a town of rude waiters (in other restaurants). We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"The salsa and beans are excellent, but also very easy to fill up on.  Menu selection is is large, and portions are good sized.  Ask to be seated by the window for great views of the strip.  Service is usually excellent, but can be spotty if it is busy.  Parking can be a problem, especially on the weekends.  Burritos are huge, fajitas come sizzling, and I recommend any dish with camarones -- you won't get cheated."}
{"text":"VEGANS Beware !! All the beans have cheese at his location only !! We love the other 2 locations in Vegas but went to this one tonight & were told all beans have cheese mixed in. Never been to a restaurant that didn't allow you to say no to cheese.   They made our 2 daughters avocado & Rice burritos no xtra charge. Everything else was good - what we've come to expect from our favorite mexican restaurant in LV. They offer Veggie fajitas, enchiladas & Avocado tacos with cabbage (ask for no mayo to be added) so we like it here but won't return to this location."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were exhausted from a day of exploring Vegas and hangry by the time we got to the restaurant. But it came highly recommended by my friend so I wanted to try. I was a bit worried because we passed through the dining room by the largest dinner party I'd ever seen. No joke, like 40 or 50 at one long table. (Making sense of the bus parked in the parking lot). Anyway I thought for sure our service would be slow. But not at all! Service was fast and very attentive. Food was super yummy. I had vegetable enchiladas and they were so good! Daughter had chicken quesadillas. We couldn't even finish half because we of course ate a bunch of chips and dip before our meal came! Our waiter was so nice. He was very busy but extremely efficient. He kept calling us his ladies. Also the live music perked us up. It was quite an enjoyable meal!  Also because I ordered the vegetable enchilada the waiter asked if I was vegetarian. I said yes. So he made sure to let me know the soup they bring out for a starter was chicken based broth. I felt it was very thoughtful for him to let me know even though I didn't ask or say anything about being vegetarian."}
{"text":"Wow, what a place! A huge menu that is quite a task to figure out where to start and for me I ended up with the Carnitas - lean pork marinated with fresh oranges and spices. Served with chiles toreados, green sauce, and guacamole and was very happy indeed. Service was super fast and very friendly and the entertainment was fun as well. Located far enough off the strip to make you forget you are still in Vegas is a big plus too.  Between the birthday's being celebrated and the bride and groom coming in with their wedding party after getting married it all made for a fun evening that was just the right balance of loud and peaceful.  We did not take advantage of it -- and nor did I know it existed until we saw it when we left but the amazing part is: Our Desert Inn location, Just 10 Minutes From The Las Vegas Strip offers a free shuttle service from the Las Vegas Strip for our out of town guests! Call 702.735.6828 to make a reservation. Now that is service!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Experience. Food was good. Restaurant was so beautiful. Our cute waiter David was so friendly."}
{"text":"It has always confused me that any of the Lindo restaurants around town are popular, let alone highly rated. We've been to the one in Green Valley, the one in the west near Summerlin and to this restaurant multiple times (usually convenience or other members of our party choose Lindo), and every one is just disappointing.  Pros for this location are atmosphere and service. Service is always great here and vibes are warm, friendly and welcoming.  The food? Bland, flavorless and overpriced. Two small, cheese enchiladas with a thin lake of runny beans and a 1/4 cup of molded rice? $11.50. Nothing tastes like anything here. No salt, no spice. The salsa is the only remotely flavorful thing and that isn't saying much. Chips were ok. Chicken on the taco salad is dry and rubbery. Mole was bland. My kid's chicken finger and fries meal consisted of seven wet, floppy steak fries and a very thin single piece of breaded chicken fried to a crisp and sliced into five pieces. Weird. He didn't eat it.  What is everyone else eating here? Are we taking crazy pills? This food is just not good."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful meal and experience.  Wait staff were friendly and never allowed our glasses to go unfilled.  We were looking for the Las Vegas, Nevada signature meal while on vacation and found it."}
{"text":"Take 8 people here for dinner and not a good meal in the bunch. Nice place, good service, lousy food. Too bad."}
{"text":"Went around 7pm on a weekday and it was relatively busy, but my boyfriend and I were seated right away. Our drink order was taken within a minute or two, and the food and service was all good! They brought our drinks quickly, as well as chips and salsa. I had the chicken enchiladas and my boyfriend had the fish tacos. Both were delivered faster than we anticipated and were delicious. Good portion of food, although it was a little pricy. We paid about $45. There was no mariachi since it was a weekday, but they did have a live singer singing mexican music. The best part was the horchata I ordered - yum!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great! The ambiance, the margaritas, and definitely the food. It's always hard to decide, but I've never been let down. Tableside guacamole is Amazingly fresh and you're never ignored by the busser or server, there's always someone to give you more chips...which disappear quickly. This is also a great place to go for a birthday because who doesn't like a sombrero and tequila shot for their birthday!!!"}
{"text":"I've experienced better, the rice had no taste, we had like 5 waiters each one would either bring you something or just ask if everything is ok. I love Mexican food but being Puerto Rican I need my food to have flavor and spices and it was just bland. :-/"}
{"text":"Never again!  I had two margaritas.  The first was a banana margarita that had no flavor.  The second was a coconut margarita that had three live, decorative ants.  Of course, I did not drink it.  The chilaquiles were made with tortilla strips!!!  Worst of all, the food was nearly flavorless.  The restaurant itself is decorated nicely and the staff are friendly.  After confirming the ants in my drink, management comped my meal.  Never again will I set foot on this place."}
{"text":"My family is not a fan of this place AT ALL. Coming from Texas, we prefer Tex-Mex. Traditional Mexican just doesn't hold a candle to the delicious hybrid Texan cuisine. That said, I can appreciate new things,  but I agree that this is not the best Mexican food. Forget fresh veggies - there's a lot of brown on the plate.  I haven't eaten a real meal here, just went here for the bar food and drinks, which, by the way, has a KILLER view. This is a great place to come on holidays if you don't have a balcony (which I do) to see the Strip set off fireworks. You can check it out because they're open until 2.   The food prices at happy hour are good, the taste is fine and the chips and dip are good. The drinks are strong which, is why people order from bars, right? The staff is very friendly and the place always has a zillion cars around it."}
{"text":"Saturday was our friend's 95 birthday, I called 2 weeks in advance explained about the 95 birthday and we would like a table with a view considering the occasion. I called once during this time and changed the number from 11 to 12 and again explained the occasion and wanting a view table. The day of the birthday, they called me to be sure we were still coming.  I explained we were and that it was a very special occasion. They understood and everything was set.  We get there and are told it's 30 minute wait for our reservation.  So we stand by the bathrooms for 30 minutes waiting. We were finally called and told we could have a table in the middle of the restaurant now or wait ANOTHER 30 minutes for our reservation with a view. So much for making a reservation. Granted, they were busy, but they should have the table reservation system figured out by now. I would have given 1 star but I added another because the waiters/servers did a good job."}
{"text":"I still dont understand how Las Vegas can rank this as best of Las Vegas in the RJ. 3 of us tried this last night using the 20% off coupon in the RJ.  This has got to be some of the worst and most overpriced mexican food we have ever had, even with the coupon.  This place was packed with white people and not many mexicans except for the servers.  2 people in our party were mexican and the both said this was just a glorified taco bell.  Food was covered with white/yellow goooe oily cheese. portions were small.  My friends called the free sopa de fideo, sopa de calcetenas (sock water)  It had no flavor and just a tomatoe colored water with pasta in it.  Guys, there are much better mexican restaurants in town.  I dont know how this chain stays in business.  The prices are $$$$$$$$ $19 for any seafood, $14 for combos, $15 for chicken dishes."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoy this restaurant. Today was a totally different story. We went for lunch and our server Yaeir was not the best. The only time we saw him was when he took our order and when he gave us our check. My husband had to ask for refills on his water more than once (which someone else filled).  He never asked if we needed anything else, or how our food was. IF we return to this  restaurant, we hope that we get better service than what we received from this server. It was a slow time of the day, there was no excuses for this."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is really good and the staff is very nice.  Guacamole is yummy!"}
{"text":"Found a new Mexican place I wanted to try last night, pulled up to the door an hour before close, chairs were already on the tables, employees sweeping the floor by the front door. So, away we went.  After a disappointing experience at one of the other Michoacan restaurants in town, we figured, why not give the original a try?  We were greeted and seated immediately, had our drink order taken right away, and chips were delivered promptly. So far, so good!  Checking out the menu, it wasn't sticker shock, per se - however, it was disappointing seeing how pricy the food was. If it is good though, it's worth it.  Deciding on our food, we ordered and watched the playoff game while we waited. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time, the true test was about to begin.  Cutting into the enchilada, it was melted cheese all over. + Tasting the enchilada, not super disappointed, but not wowed. The taco was good, a little lacking on meat, a little more lettuce and a pile of cheese.  Unfortunately, when I ordered my meal with no beans, they still put beans on my tostada, so, I paid nearly $14 for an enchilada, taco and rice. Sadly, this is not much more than had I ordered a la carte.   $4.25 for a cheese enchilada or $4.50 for a chicken enchilada?!  If friends want to go here, we'll go again, on our own though... not sure it's worth the money."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I didn't update this review!  I am NEVER EVER going back to Lindo Michoacan.  You couldn't drag me there if my life depended on it.  We had such a wonderful meal our 1st time there.  Not so much for the 2nd time.  Once again, I had one of their signature chicken dishes (can't remember the name) and a preparada.  This time I was violently ill for 2 days afterwards.  I'm not sure what gave me the food poisoning, but it was horrible.  Could've just been a fluke, but trust me, I am not going back to find out!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. Great food, great prices and the staff is always so nice.  Even when I order something as simple as the tacos I'm always pleased.   Their guacamole has this unique kick to it that I just love.   I love when the mariachi band cruses the dining room. I never find it annoying. :) It makes for a festive experiance!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat! Every time we go in there the place is clean and the staff are friendly. The food is excellent and we never had a bad experience. If everything for us on the menu or the beef and gelatos. The beans and rice or offended Mexican like Mexico and the enchiladas were awesome! On a sidenote, we always get margaritas and their fantastic!  The service is really fast and there's never a line."}
{"text":":( Very disappointed. Not worth it. Don't go. We paid way too much for what we got. Poor quality. My husbands exact words \"The steak tasted like I was chewing on bubble gum..\" The restaurant looks nice on the inside but don't let that fool you. Save your money. Go somewhere else. RUN!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it was very good food. The waiter was a little snippy because we didn't speak Spanish but over all it was good. The prices are high. I am not sure if I would come back unless they lowered the price."}
{"text":"Excelente vista y buena comida mexicana vale la pena esperar para disfrutar de la comida ta que siempre esta lleno :)"}
{"text":"We love coming here!!  We sit on the patio which is quiet and peaceful. Happy hour is 2-5 and margaritas are 2 for 1, even on the patio.   The service is great. Everyone is really friendly and attentive.   Food is good and I love the bean dip they serve with salsa and chips when you sit down.  The nachos are amazing. They are multilayered and covered with toppings. Everything we have had has been great.   No complaints from me, which is rare ;)"}
{"text":"Great service very time. Gorditas De Cameron is the best I have ever had. Owner Javier is always here to please. Always going to come back!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome atmosphere, spectacular view and the best customer service in town! Top notch as always."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Service was great. Everyone in the restaurant was very nice and helpful. The only reason this place does not get 5 stars is that they did not have any queso dip, a staple at every Mexican restaurant I've every been too."}
{"text":"As I have read many reviews I see a variance of good and bad. So to b fair I will agree with the many 5star ratings as I too have enjoyed the good side, my point tonight is to point out the shortcomings of this restaurant. I brought my son and his wife to enjoy the view as well as the food. The view cannot b beat, now the food, which is more important than the view. Without getting into it, it sucked! Nothing came out right.  Now, after talking with the manager (twice) I explained how the food was bad, I got nothing. No apologies and not one, let me take this one meal off ur bill.  I got a bill for everything. 3 out of the 4 meals were unsatisfactory as I pointed out. I my business if someone is not happy with my service I go OUT of my way to rectify the issue. All I got was a bill.  I can see Vegas els-ware. There a too many Mexican restaurants around. Finally, if anyone at this restaurant has the balls, give me a call."}
{"text":"This place has lost its original tradition. No longer do they have great food or customer service. I took my mother there on her birthday and the food was more of a commercial taste. It's no longer traditional cooking . You can tell the rice and beans are canned and bagged. To make things worse I asked the waiter to have them sing happy birthday to my mother and it never happened. Right before I left I asked the hostess to do it and she said she would but we waited so long we finally decided to leave.  Really disappointment. The music is real loud and you have to shout your order. The funny thing was I was told by a friend that this place went downhill and I went against his judgement. I thought he was over analytical. Take my comment here and don't go there."}
{"text":"The food, the view (not only outside but the waiters...oh my! ) is amazing. You have to try the fresh flour tortillas, fresh guacamole made table side, the fresh margarita's and the queso dip. VERY GOOD!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Went here for a wedding banquet celebration and it was just utterly amazing. The camarones rancheros I ordered were extremely delicious. Would want to come here again, it had a legitimate Mexican atmosphere. Not to mention cute waiters! ;)"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to have a drink with my husband at a restaurant but was always too afraid to because what if one of us gets pulled over?  Neither one of us wants a DUI.  So we take turns and sometimes he'll have one and sometimes I'll have one.   Yesterday I had an epiphany...I thought about this place.  It's right beside my house...we could...walk there....and BOTH have a margarita. TOGETHER.  Genius!!! So that's what we did on Wednesday 9-14-16 at 6PM.   $71.75 got us two margaritas, a kids meal, two entrees, and an order of tableside guacamole.  You won't find a mexican restaurant with better ambiance than this one.  It's kinda dark inside, all the staff are dressed in traditional garbs, and the decorations are over-the-top-mexicanny.  Is that a word?   I never liked guacamole until I tried the tableside guac here.  They make it right in front of you (duh, tableside lol).  It is so fresh and chock full of tomatoes, jalapenos, lime juice, the avocados are perfectly ripe, and it's so nice and salty.  It's just the best guacamole ever!   I ordered the al pastor tacos because al pastor is fucking delicious and the menu said it came with 3 tacos topped with pineapple, cilantro, and onion, with rice and beans on the side.  That sounded amazing but they delivered it with no pineapple.  I might be alone here but the pineapple is the best part of an al pastor taco.  Like when I go to Taco Y Taco I always ask for extra extra pineapple.  I asked our waiter and he said no problem and went to the kitchen.  In a few minutes a manager lady comes over and apologizes and says they have no pineapple.  NO PINEAPPLE??? My tiny little heart was crushed into a thousand pieces.  Okay, I'm bein' dramatic, but I was seriously bummed.    This place has good food but it's very pricey.  Even though it's right next to our house we've only been 3 times which tells me it's not worth the price.  I'd recommend this place is you want mexican food in a seriotypical environment but it ain't a 5 star joint."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere with music , artwork and food.  Also if your Birthday Tequila Poppers with a nice Birthday mariachi song!    Definitely great prices as well as lunch specials.  Able to fill up on chips, salsa , and beans alone.   Also great job on the menu variety"}
{"text":"Celebrated my Step fathers 70th birthday here! We had a blast the Mariachi band came around and sang happy birthday and tossed A shot of tequila down his throat LOL it was hilarious he was drinking margaritas prior and they also gave us churro's and whip cream it was delicious their food is really good and my favorite part is they serve frijoles with the salsa and chips so fresh and hot salsa is mild not too spicy. Beautiful view as well."}
{"text":"We've tried several \"recommended\" Mexican restaurants since moving to Las Vegas and this one is by far the best! The servers are always friendly, prompt and attentive. The atmosphere is nice, relaxing and clean. Everything we've had in our 5+ visits has been really good! My husband even prefers Lindo's menudo over our favorite Mexican spot in California. Management here is very nice and truly concerned with you having a great experience."}
{"text":"I always get the Camarones Tia Esther. It's been my favorite for years. Never disappoints. Today I had a hard day at work so I got a coconut margarita, too. It was very good. I've never been a fan of fideo but that's just me. The corn tortillas are made fresh on site and they're so good.   I love this place!!"}
{"text":"The service is great and fast.  The shredded chicken tacos in some kind of tomato based sauce are cheap and amazing.  I also like both the carne Asada and shrimp quesadillas on the flour tortillas. Not as good on the corn tortillas for some reason.  Beer is reasonably priced, but the mixed cocktails never turn out quite right.  I like the live band, but it gets way too loud."}
{"text":"Had great time with family and friends. Great food and drinks. Only exception was the lemon drop martini, use caution."}
{"text":"I never do this but I have to. The food was great the view to die for the service was the best. I will be back very soon to try another dish."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food away from the strip ! A must when visiting Las Vegas . The give you chips salsa  and beans when you're first seated . Super cute traditional Mexican decor and live entertainment even when we went on a Tuesday ."}
{"text":"My favorite dish here, that I've had probably 20 times is Carnitas ala Coka Cola. This time the sauce was seriously lacking flavor and heat. I think they left something out or it was old. You get one more shot."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for over 20 years.  Food is always great. I give 5 stars for dinner service, I'd only give 4 for lunch as they are really slow at lunchtime. Makes it hard within my 1 hour lunch."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant ever amazing ........ real Mexican food places that makes me feel proud of where I come from"}
{"text":"If you come to Vegas, want Mexican food and don't go to this place, you have done yourself a disservice.  From the atmosphere, to the drinks, to the incredible food, you just can't beat this place.  It is really easy to see how this place has won \"Best of Las Vegas\" for so many years."}
{"text":"Went here last night for my fathers 60th birthday, by his request. He suggested this place because he said he went there before, he said \"I had a fish dish, it was really good for the price...  I loved it. 1st of all its the best view imaginable, the food was delicious and the service was better than expected - fast, and friendly.    the birthday song they sing is amazing!!! I will be back."}
{"text":"El mejor restaurante mexicano en Las Vegas, esta noche lleve a mis padres que vinieron de visita de Miami,FL y les encanto salimos muy satisfechos y contentos, quiero darle las gracias al mesero ROGER y todo el equipo de Lindo Michoacan ,ROGER nos hizo sentir como en casa un gran mesero con un servicio excepcional. Mi familia y yo describimos Lindo Michoacan con una gran atenci√≥n de los trabajadores,calidad de la comida , excelencia al servicio al cliente,la hygiene del restaurante super, rapides en la atenci√≥n en fin todo divino. Muchas graciass."}
{"text":"El Lindo is one of our favorite spots in Las Vegas (Henderson, I know).  Spectacular views of the city, great bean dip and chips, amazing service (these guys work hard for the money), fun atmosphere and of course, really delicious entrees.  If you go on the weekend they'll have a single musician jamming out hard on guitar or some keys and singing/playing along with some pre-recorded tracks. These guys are INTO it, so just sit back and enjoy them enjoying themselves.  Food-wise, I've had a lot of different items and they have all been good. Probably not the absolute greatest food I've ever had, but it's quite tasty and the prices are very reasonable.  As a whole package, this is one of our go-to spots and we always bring our out of towners here and they rave about it. Being on top of seemingly the largest hill in Henderson makes it a cool experience, so try to get a window seat and make sure to hang over the railing for a bit before you head off for the evening."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Staff is ALWAYS welcoming and friendly, the food is great, the decor makes you feel like you're in Mexico, this is one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food.  Friendly atmosphere, fast service.  Table side guacamole is exceptional.  Great place for family dinner and the kids are very welcomed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas! My first time eating here was in 1991! Yes!  Back than it was a small little place with just a few tables, and now it is a Yelp Favorite!  The ambiance is so beautiful with a good energy. The staff is welcoming and respectful.  I ordered a Chile releno and a chorizo soft taco. My sister had the chicken fajita burrito. Both entrees were amazing as usual! Chips, salsa and bean dip, THE BEST!  Our waiter was very attentive and we were extremely happy with our dining experience.  Thank you Lindo for always providing excellent food and customer service! There is a reason why you are such a Las Vegas Favorite for all these years.."}
{"text":"Food is great  I took away two stars for the service.   I order from here regularly since I work in the area.. this most recent pick order I did; I received poor service. I was \"blamed\" for my order not being received and told me that I called the wrong location. Wrong, I called \"The Original Lindo Michoacan\" on D.I. So I called the same number back that I called in for the order I made originally and asked her which location I am calling and she told me D.I.  Moral of my story is I CALLED THE CORRECT LOCATION."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place in Vegas. The salsas are fantastic. Service was spot on and the portions were huge!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to all three locations here in the Las Vegas valley, and this one by far has the best view! You can see the entire city of Las Vegas from your table. This location is Very Beautiful, however, I only gave this place three stars due to the service. We literally only saw our waiter once the entire night, and once we were ready to go, it took him 20 minutes to grab the card to pay the check. I understand it's busy, but it was a Tuesday night, and not that many customers were there. Also, management did see us waiting, and made eye contact with my boyfriend, but still nothing was done. I would come back for the food and the view. However, I prefer the original location in terms of service"}
{"text":"Awesom place! This is gonna be my new spot every time I'm coming to Vegas  plus I'm from Michoacan Mexico!"}
{"text":"So.. came for lunch with friends my food was good but our friends food was cold.. his shrimp was in this red sauce that tasted like tomato paste but the server would not know that because he never came back to ask how everything was.. I had to get up and let someone standing by the bar know.. they were very nice and got it taken care of right away.. the server came to our table a total of 3 times 1 greeted us 2 took our order 3 dropped the check that was it. The only reason that they got 2 stars was because of the kind gentlemen that helped me by the bar. Our server was Miguel"}
{"text":"It was ok they could not  get our order right  if they tried hard enough. We sent the food back 3 times because it tasted like a lemon and only a lemon it was weird.. my enchiladas were good but I ordered chicken and they came out cheese and it took forever to get my food back and then the server was like you ordered chicken? And my 6 year daughter remembered what I ordered anyways it was an ok experience. The margaritas look good"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant's sister location and found the exact same wonderfulness here as I did there. It only seems proper to give it the same wonderful review. I've been in Vegas for a bit over 2 months. While I haven' t made the effort to go to the strip and try the festivities, I have made the effort to order a margarita at the non strip restaurants along the west side of Vegas with no satisfaction. But I came here on a suggestion by a friend and I have to say that I have found my new margarita place. That's not to say that their drinks are their only point of recognition. There food is delicious and a fairly diverse menu. But what really impressed me, outside of the drink, was the service. All of the service staff was attentive and friendly. I wasn't stuck with my server, everyone made an effort to check up on the table. Whenever we needed something, it was addressed right away. I would highly recommend this to any locals or tourists wanting to try something outside of the strip. Come on in, order some food, and have a drink!"}

{"text":"What a great place.  My fiancee and I were in Las Vegas on vacation and wanted to eat some authentic Mexican food like we do back at home, and this was what our friends suggested (although there was another location with a better view but we couldn't get the GPS to find it).  The inside of the restaurant is comfortable, nothing fancy just your typical layout.  The server we had was polite and very helpful.  We ordered the Guacamole appetizer and I knew we were in for a treat when he came out and made it right in front of us after asking us how we would like it tailored.  It was fantastic, probably the best guacamole I've had.  Unfortunately this lead us to eating three baskets of chips, but that's the side effect of being in Vegas and not being able to control the pig-out factor everyday.  I really wish I hadn't eaten that many chips though, because the meal I got was crazy delicious.  They have a lot of menu choices and a lot of specials, all of which sounded great, so I didn't really know where to begin.  I was contemplating between two of the chicken dishes and asked the waiter what he preferred.  He pointed me to a third dish; the Pollo Sarandeado, which turned out to be right up my alley so I'm glad he persuaded.  I was skeptical at first, as the sauce was a blend of peppers and some kind of mayo which I'm not typically a fan of, but this was sublime.  It turned out to be one of those meals where you can't stop eating even though you're so full but then you stop anyways because you're THAT full.  I took the rest back to the hotel in a doggy bag and then forgot I didn't have a fridge to put it in.  Sad times.  Bottom line though, get the Pollo Sarandeado.  My fiancee had one of the burritos and she was equally happy.  The drinks came around a little slow, but they have a team of waiters and usually the ones that aren't yours will still be good about refilling chips and keeping an eye on things.  Overall, I wasn't bothered by the speed at all and the food / politeness more then made up for it.  Really happy I tried this place and I'll easily give it a big recommendation to any visitors."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Vegas I always have to stop here the day after a night out. The service isn't the best, but the food and drinks make up for it ! Everything we've ever had on the menu was good. Their margaritas are amazing ! Micheladas are supper yummy too ! The view is beautiful you can see all of Las Vegas. Real Mexican food and all home made even the tortillas!"}
{"text":"We love it here. They treat my little girl great even though she's wild, loud, and gets into mischief. The food is always good and consistent. We love the singer. He lets Emmalee sing and stand with him on stage. The place is kept clean and the view is beautiful. We come 3 times a week or more and are always treated well. The fact that isn't family friendly is why we make the drive here instead of going to other restaurants."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough of about this place - Food, Service, Quality, Price all 5* !  We took at Taxi from @Green Valley Ranch to the location on Carnegie. When we concluded our meal we asked the hostess if she could call us a cab and instead the Owner/Manager insisted on driving us back himself rather than calling a cab - Incredible!!"}
{"text":"Took my team from South Florida last night there as this has been a tradition for several years and we were extremely dissapointed;  only 1 out of 10 finished their meal.  Most dishes were over cooked, tasteless and cold.  Last time we will visit the restaurant and recommend all pass on this restaurant."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, this might have been my first time eating at this franchised restaurant.  We had our small company Christmas lunch here today.  The sun is out but it is chilly.  But, not as chilly inside the restaurant.   I suspect when we got there the ambient temperature was 55 degrees.  If any patrons had worn an outer garment into the establishment, they were still wearing it.  I did not wear a coat and  my feet to my hands were chilled.  The service was good and the lunch menu is priced competitively.  Nice decorum but, sorry, I just cannot get that excited about standard Mexican food.  All I see is an extra 2\" around my waistline without much payoff.  I mean, like 15 gingerbread cookies are delish and you know there is a price to pay.  But, seeing a visually uninspired enchilada with cheese and beans and still having to work an extra hour in the gym does not motivate me to go back.  Maybe that is why margaritas are so popular in Mexican restaurants....if you get buzzed enough, who cares?"}
{"text":"My experience at Lindo Michoacan has always been five stars. Even today I am rating the overall experience at four stars due to some glitches which I'll mention shortly. I'll start with positive highlights from today as I believe it's fair to point out the good. Today I decided to try a new item, the \"Milanesa con papas\" which is a lightly breaded steak with French fries on the side, this dish delivers in value, taste, portion size and presentation. Two thumbs up! One of our dinner companions today had not such a good experience which truly saddens me as I love this place and love it when people share my experience. Her dish seemed to take a little bit longer than expected, the restaurant was busy so we understand. However her steak came undercooked when she asked for it to be well done. Steak was taken back to the kitchen and came back burnt to the table. My humble suggestion to the manager would be for waiters to follow simple directions and relay them back to the kitchen. With that being said I will be back to give them another chance."}
{"text":"This place is great for groups with friends and/or a romantic dinner w that special someone. Your meal will always start out with their delicious freshly made chips/ salsa/ and refried beans, but pace yourself on them... Yes I know it'll be hard but you want to leave room for the real deal. I highly recommend their margaritas if it's been \"that kind of day\" or even if it hasn't you deserve it right? Now as far as their menu selection I will let you explore that yourself... I fell that giving away my opinion on their entrees would be the equivalent of telling you how that movie you haven't seen yet turns out... And I'm not that evil. I will tell you this you won't be disappointed, the place is highly authentic and delivers in price point. Now try it out... And write your own review."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is usually the service, and the food is pretty damn good. We eat there all the time, never disappointed. Have been going since before my 11 year old was born. Great food, all the time!   They serve beans and salsa with chips.  My favorite dishes are fajitas, chimichunga, *pollo sereandado*, pollo mojo de aho, pollo con rajas y crema, pork green burrito, sopitos, yummy soup... the chili colorado is not the best.  Lunch specials are great to keep prices down, come before 4, for that. Drink is included.  Horchata and Jamaica (huh-my-kuh) are yummy. Maybe add a sugar to the jamaica. Frozen margaritas are best ever, delicious: coconut, mango, lime. Happy hour is after 5, get the carafe! They have bulldogs too.  Fried Ice cream is yummy and also they have a plantain flambeau, strong alcohol flavor, ask for no alcohol if sharing with kids.   Overall, relaxed setting, great food, quick service, fairly consistent. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came to this location to celebrate my 28th birthday with friends and family , made reservations at 7:30pm and didn't get sat until 8.. granted it was a Friday night so they were busy.. took about 40 for them to finally take our food orders and about another 40 to get the food out .. myself as well as a few others in my party ordered ceviche. It was the worst ceviche I've ever had. Had absolutely no flavor and soaked in water .. completely over priced for that type of service and flavorless food. I was extremely disappointed . The manager did take off all of our ceviche orders , which was nice. But I won't be going back there."}
{"text":"A-MAY-ZING!!! From start to finish, from floor-to-ceiling all the way to service and ambience this place is amazing!!! Anytime I have someone coming to visit me in Vegas I bring them to this restaurant because it never disappoints!!!! Typically I order a frozen margarita and their tableside fresh Guacamole right off the bat. The servers are always very friendly and attentive and no matter what I order it is always delicious. This place can get very busy so be sure to call ahead to see what the wait is."}
{"text":"We came in with a group of 24- half of those were kids- to celebrate my graduation. The staff was awesome! They were so attentive and nice! We had refills before we even asked and they made sure the kids got their food first which is huge. As if that wasn't enough, the food was delicious! Would highly recommend this restaurant and we will definitely come back the next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellente'. Greeted at the door and promtly seated. Live music is a nice touch and not overly obtrusive on your conversation and is something Vegas seriously lacks. I must say we had excellent service through out our meal. It started off with the obvious chips and salsa but the addition of bean dip is always welcome cause I love me some bean dip. We ordered the Marinated Chicken Castillo,  Flautas and a Shredded Beef Burrito. Man it came out quick cause we barely got through one bowl of chips. I like the fact all the meals came with guacamole which saves you a ton of dinero, cause what's Mexican food without some guacamole. Drinks were always full to help put out the fire  cause I like it spicy. I really should eat here more cause the shits da bomb. Five jalape√±os for this spot and see why it has so many Best of Last Vegas Awards... Oh and tip the musician, he's really good."}
{"text":"Since moving to a gas about 12 years ago, \"Linda Michoacan\" has always been then \"go to\" Mexican restaurant in Vegas. However, today was the first time I tried this particular location, and I didn't even know there were so many locations now.  So this one was definitely a great location to give a try. They stood true to the authenticity of the food and atmosphere.  I LOVE the service, and the quality of hospitality.  I always will recommends this restaurant to anyone looking for \"real\" tasty Mexican food served from an amazing group of people."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything about it makes it fun, entertaining, and satisfying! The ambiance of the restaurant isnt dimmly lit and boring, it is open and filled with people. Ask for a window seat, you will be viewing the entire Vegas valley, and if you time it right you can see the sunset. The salsa and chips they serve you are prompt and authentico, mmm,  Margaritas, delicious and they dont skimp out on the alcohol! I recommend the table side made guacamole. There is nothing better than frech guac, and I am in looove.   My friends and I usually share plates because their portions are so huge. I have had the burrito bionico and a few other stuff that I dont recall, probably because I didnt order it..    All in all, great & authentic Mexican food that is full of flavor and size. Great staff. Great environment."}
{"text":"I didn't like the birria the taste was not there the sauce to watery. The rice was mushy. I will not come here again and they say they are the best in vegas.   yeah sure.... Not."}
{"text":"We go here all the time, and the service is always incredible but tonight was next level. We ended up eating at the bar, and Luis was beyond amazing. His drinks were incredible, and he was beyond sweet the entire time. (My husband and I agree that he is the nicest bartender that we have ever had.) Thank you, Luis, for making tonight special! We will be back to see you for sure!"}
{"text":"We have lived in Henderson for 25 years and have always enjoyed Linda Michoacan. I am sorry to say that the food has gone down hill. Not as fresh and tasty as they used to be. Service and atmosphere are still excellent but my family will now drive the extra 15 or so minutes to Casa Don Juan for an excellent Mexican meal. Sorry a Linda."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant! Yum! And the view is unbeatable! The staff is friendly and will help with whatever you need. The bartenders always go out of their way to make us anything we want not on the menu"}
{"text":"Amazing ! The food is decent and hardly authentic (very Americanized) but yummy none the less- the bartenders will help you customize your own drinks but the real reason people come is the amazing strip views! Make a reservation if it's an evening visit and request a window table! Great for the family at a table or a great date night at the bar with the best views around!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of 11.  Service was decent, what can you expect with a large group?  Ordered the mixed fajitas and asked for the black beans instead of the refried beans.  Food was ok, nothing to write home about.  Total was $38 including tip for one plate of fajitas and one margarita ... a little pricey."}
{"text":"Update 30-Oct-18  Wifey and I stopped by yesterday (Sunday) morning for a late breakfast.   What a great idea!   The place wasn't crowded but the chorizo and eggs and the machacha were awesome.   It was a great way to start the day.  Also, the Mexican coffee was perfect, strong and smooth.   Mexican breakfast is really good."}
{"text":"Certainly worth the drive off the strip.  The place is huge, the food has always been great and consistent.  They have many dishes to choose from, you can't go wrong...  They make the guacamole right at your table to your liking (love that).  I've sent many coworkers there and I always get positive feedback.  Apparently there are now a few of these restaurants but this is my favorite.  I can't speak for the others since I haven't been to them."}
{"text":"Service wasn't great. Food was ok, but not worth coming back. They did have a variety which was nice, but again my first and last time, bonito michoacan is much better."}
{"text":"I have been to this same location twice now and I intentionally waited to write a review to ensure it was honest.   First of all, this location is incredible. Sit at the bar or in the back room to get a fantastic view of strip and the mountain range (especially around sunset.) That alone is worth the price of the margaritas...which are FANTASTIC. Their margs are reasonably priced ($10-12) and absolutely delicious. You'll get a nice buzz and the fruit flavors taste real and fresh (even if they're aren't!)  Each meal comes with chips, salsa and bean dip. The chips are \"sturdy,\" the salsa is thick and has a real kick to it (maybe a bit too much kick) and the bean dip is hot and delicious.   Now, the last time I ate here, I had the cheese stuffed, bacon wrapped, deep fried shrimp at the suggestion of our waiter and it was memorable and tasty. This time, I went with something more traditional (the carnitas and bean burrito and beef taco with rice and beans) ...and the leftovers are still sitting in my fridge.  The meat in the burrito, despite appearing juicy, was so bland! There's really nothing else I can even say about it, to be honest. The same was true of the taco. The portions are large and the rice and beans are great, but there just wasn't any flavor coming through.   Conversely, my friend got the fish tacos with a side of their haba√±ero sauce and raves about them constantly...but this second time around I just felt underwhelmed.   To their credit, the menu is gigantic, with something for everyone. The staff is friendly and service is prompt. They've even got a huge sombrero to celebrate (...humiliate?) people celebrating birthdays and everyone generally sings along in good spirit.   Expect to wait on the weekends. This Friday night our wait about about 30 minutes after arriving at 6pm, but they've got it done to a science and everything moves fairly quickly it seems. The main room can be very noisy (especially with live music) but the backroom is quieter...and colder."}
{"text":"Great and Delicious Mexican food. Best Hand made tortillas in vegas. Highly Recommend to eat for dinner or any time."}
{"text":"There are not enough superlatives to describe this restaurant.  I cant even begin to describe how delicious my Carnitas were.  Served with warm fresh tortillas I wanted to lick my plate clean.   Killer chips, salsa, and bean dip Great service, incredibly cute bus boy, and reasonably priced.  I will be going back on my next visit to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Why is it nearly impossible to find great Mexican restaurants in Vegas?!!!? I think this place by far might have the best burrito, but it still doesn't come close to the best burritos in Cali.  Their chips are my fave kind...thin and crispy and doesn't have the oils oil stench.   The \"cry today cry tomorrow\" dish was REALLY GOOD, the meat was DELICIOUS where it was cooked medium rare, but majority of it was way too rare for me so I got a few bites. I recommend maybe ordering it medium so that they can accomplish the medium rare steak. The sauce wasn't spicy at all and had great flavors! I'll come back and get this next time!   Service was amazing...i almost felt like some VIP customer and that's how they treat all their customers from my observation. We left a fat til for them because they more than deserved it!!"}
{"text":"This Restaurant is like Heaven, The Food is really good, and the Staff there are really nice. A lot of people though. My family and i Visited Lindo Michoacan this past Summer because of the Review But we had to Wait for a about 20 minutes. We were about to leave. But then they found a great table for us. I got to see how the hand made tortillas were made from that Table.( They got alot of Kool Mexican decorations. Lindo Michoacan doesn't disappoint, But over all its The Best Mexican restaurant in Nevada"}
{"text":"I came right before closing and I love that the customer service was still warm welcoming! And the food has been good both times I've came. The bean dip is good, don't care to much for the chips but, other then that I would recommend it"}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican food. Sorry I can't say what I ate but it was great. The only thing they didn't have was con queso white cheese dip but they did have a great bean dip. Service was fantastic too."}
{"text":"If it were socially acceptable I would have licked the plate clean.  Hands down some of the best Mexican I've ever had.  And the service is exceptional!"}
{"text":"Fantastic ambiance, view and services. This was our second time visiting this restaurant and got an awesome tale with a phenomenal view of Henderson and Las Vegas. The food was excellent and watching people get sang to for thier birthdays was very cool. The server was very attentive and stayed on top of our drinks, food and various needs. This will our restaurant when we want Mexican food."}
{"text":"I would give 1 star, however the view is worth 2 stars on its own. If your a fan of real authentic flavorful Mexican food this ain't your place. Bland and flavorless, no Bueno!! Atmosphere is great. Customer service was good. I really wish I could like this place. I've been here several times and will come back, but only for chips, salsa, margaritas, and that fantastic view!"}
{"text":"Visiting a buddy in actual Vegas and the first place he takes me is here! Whoa! The service is fantastic. The portions are huge. The salsa was good, not my favorite. I had the chicken enchiladas. Lots of cheese! The shredded chicken wasn't seasoned too well but it was still delicious. My friends had the largest tortas I've ever seen in my life! Lots of vegetarian options too! Be ready to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"While the food was excellent, and our booth was comfortable, there were some significant problems on my first visit here.    Limey Guacamole made tableside to order of spice, tomatoes, onions, and cilantro tasted very good, along with homemade tortilla chips, hot salsa, and a mild Bean Dip.  Fideo Soup was different and interesting: tomato based but not noticeably so, with delicate thin and short noodles.  Water refills came slowly, and had to be requested.  But, far worse, food was really long in coming.  We were told \"the food's on the way\" and \"It should be here soon!\"  But it really wasn't.  In fact, my party of four was seated at 6:30 p.m.; we ordered the main meal at 7:00 p.m.; and, other than guacamole and soup, no food arrived until 57 minutes later.  A friend's shrimp dish was requested to be avocado free, but her order of a Mexican Omelet included sliced avocados,  The manager did take items off the bill, but I would much rather had my order timely served.  Diane enjoyed her Shrimp Quesadilla, and I really liked my #12 Combo.  So, because the quality and taste of the food were so good here, I will make a return trip, and hope that the timeliness and efficiency of cooking and serving both improve."}
{"text":"Went for a large party birthday dinner, had a reservation and it took much longer than scheduled time to be seated. Food and service was fantastic! Went back for happy hour days later and all tending the bar were amazing, margaritas superb, and food was again fantastic! Happy to have this establishment in our new neighborhood!"}
{"text":"OMG!  What else can I say that I haven't already said about this place?  It's just always great  From the food.  The drinks. The service.  I did see a waitress with a bitchy look on here face as we walked in. But I thought whatever. She's young. It was like seeing one of my daughters with an attitude.  Lindo Michoac√°n is a must stop for me and the wife when we come to Las Vegas. We're in Vegas at least one or twice a year. This is where we come for dinner and margaritas.  This time I tried the chili verde which comes with \"you guessed it\" rice and beans. Ta da.  Eshi go some sort of shrimp and avocado salad in the avocado shells. It's was da bomb.  My food as well was off the hook. But my wife's food was to die for. Man U could have that and some chips with a margarita and be set.  The waiters were very attentive and friendly.  The place is always clean. Don't miss this place if u go to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This places isn't on my \"go back\" list. I gave one star for the customer service and two stars for the live music which I didn't understand because it was in Spanish which I like as well. Also I loved the atmosphere of the place. Now why didn't I give this place 4 or 5 stars. Well at a restaurant you have to base some on the food. Everything was bland. I ordered a chimichanga shred beef inside the shell wasn't crunchy and lol I said it didn't really taste like much even though it has red Sauce all over it. Had a good time but the food wasn't great. Thanks for the customer service :)"}
{"text":"Good food always delicious I was a little busy with my order but the water fixed right away the server and the manager was very attentive to my situation who made the reservation for 10 people but only six of us. What's able to make it we didn't feel rushed or nothing very professional it was few big parties that night the hostess should have better communication do you know what a party is and the bar in the location doesn't longer comes drinks if you gamble $20 other than that everything was cool we love this place"}
{"text":"After months of wanting to try this place I finally got the opportunity. The overall experience was \"ehh.\" The service was decent but the carne asada wasn't impressive by any means. It's definitely better than panchos and has better pricing. Overall, I probably wouldn't come back unless invited. Just not impressed."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place is awful.  We've tried it 4 times and tonight we just said never again.  Maybe it's because we've had Mexican food in Phoenix but this place has TERRIBLE service and it's ridiculously expensive and LOUD.  The view of the strip is nice if you can get one of those tables but the food is just bad.  Tried something new (again) tonight to see if I'm picking the wrong things and it's just the food and the cooking (tonight tried vegetarian fajitas and it was all green peppers, unbelievable that there were no other veggies but a few onions).  3 of us went to dinner and they forgot our soup and we sat there getting ignored when we needed a bill so we could leave the place.  Thumbs down, save your money and go down the street to Robertos."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. Nice big bar with tv. Live music. Drinks were nice and cold. Food was just average and overpriced."}
{"text":"The parking looked full on a Sunday night but we walked right in and were seated right away (family of 5).  Our waiter was friendly.  The chips and bean dip were delicious but I wasn't a huge fan of the salsa (I like my salsa chunky).   I ordered one of the shrimp dishes.  It was absolutely incredible!  Nice views and good food.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a nice dinner outing with the spouse, the friends, the family or even yourself then look no further! This place rests on top of a hill overlooking the beautiful city that is Las Vegas!   Chips and Salsa are your appetizers with a side of bean dip that is addictive in itself. While you're trying to decide what to eat for the main course you can indulge in a strawberry margarita! They usually have live music.    The only advice I can give is to make a reservation and put a request in for a city view because this place gets packed quick! Parking can be difficult so be prepared to walk. Especially after rush hour."}
{"text":"Love the place great food and service  Every time we're in Vegas we come the service is always great and food is delicious.  My husband and I are foodies and we love it here I totally recommended."}
{"text":"Been here several times and not back for the food which has been hit or miss but been back for the drinks.  Margaritas have always been very yummy!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I can't say enough about this place.  The lively atmosphere is super fun with vivid colors and art from floor to ceiling.  The food is delicious with big portions and comes out very fast but the thing that impresses us the most is the customer service.   The staff is probably the most attentive and friendly staff out of any restaurant I have ever been too.   Even when handling a take out order they are friendly, never rush you and patiently go through everything in your take out bag before giving it to you and walking you out the door.   We have to try to not go to this place cause it's always our first choice."}
{"text":"Great food-great service! We have been coming here for years for special celebrations and get togethers- always a great time had by all. The Mojitos are fantastic"}
{"text":"At one time this was my favorite. It really started a slide about 18 months ago The food and service was always 1st. class. Now the food is hit and miss. The service is not professional as it used to be. Javier the owner used to be on top of things. Really sad."}
{"text":"Def a super solid place for some great Mexican food . The family and myself ate here on a Friday night. The food was great the the view over the strip is amazing and the restaurant is loud so if your looking for that nice quiet dinner this isn't the place for you. They have live entertainment. I myself got the shrimp Enchiladas which were very good and my daughter for the breaded fried shrimp which came with a spicy sauce on the side (too spicy for kids) but the sauce was amazing! My advice would be to set a reservation and make it a little early. By the time we left around 7-730 there was a line out people waiting inside and outside (not a lot of waiting room inside)."}
{"text":"Lindo's second location is as good as the original. Finally, there is some good Mexican food in Henderson. Lindo's salsa is top-notch. The only drawback to the new location is it lacks ambiance in that the building it occupies an old Italian restaurant. Nevertheless, Lindo is a must-stop if you're in the area and are craving Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is the best sit down mexican restaurant in Vegas. The waits are long and the margaritas are strong. The ambiance is great too. Everything on their menu is great."}
{"text":"Came in for a Sunday brunch, we were seated quite fast. As you walk in the door, you see homemade tortilla being made and you can really taste the freshness of the tortilla.  As you get seated in the back, the view is amazing. You can see the whole strip from your table. Tortilla chips with red sauce and bean dip comes next.  I ordered the combination plate 1, which comes with rice, beans, chile relleno, beef taco and an enchilada. Over all pretty good, I loved the rice. But the chile relleno was soggy. I'd go back and try the other food, they have a broad selection of authentic food."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Vegas. I go there everytime I'm in town. Great food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Food is good and we eat their often however for takeout their customer service is lacking to the point of being maddening.   If you go in, they will provide chips and salsa, no problem??  Order takeout, and they want to charge extra for anything other than small bag of chips, and a measly amount of salsa.   Very frustrating.  Time to find a new restaurant that values long term customers."}
{"text":"1 star.  Here is why: this is not Mexican Food.  This is food that has gone through some strange evolution to please it's local community.  The local community is happy with it: they are always packed... so in that case, okaaaaay...   I am not going to claim to be a connoisseur of Mexican food, but well, let's just say I know good Mexican and New Mexican cuisine.  This is not it.   We have given this place several tries.  Part of the reason for their success is really about location and clientele. They have an amazing view of downtown Las Vegas and there is absolutely no other legitimate competition in the area.   Oh one more thing: I think they load up the margaritas with so much bad tequila you would not be able to taste bad food if you wanted to.   Here's the bottom line, if you can stomach the bad Mexican because you do not know any better, then have at it.  If you know good Mexican (and New Mexican) then stay away.  You will be disappointed over and over again.   Just look at the clientele, they are extremely telling if the food is authentic or not.  And again, it may have it's own authenticity - an adaptation for it's local community...which is not for me."}
{"text":"There are two big reasons why I love Lindo's: the view of the Las Vegas Strip and the house made guacamole!  Every time we come here we are welcomed by friendly staff. You can look in to the kitchen where they're busy making the homemade tortillas, and your mouth is watering even before you've been seated.   The place is usually pretty busy, and when we've been visiting it's always very loud. I like it, it makes for a great atmosphere.   As I mentioned, the house made guacamole is my favorite. They make it fresh right by the table, and you get to pick how spicy you want it. Usually they also give you a complimentary tomato soup in addition to the fresh chips and salsa, so by the time you're ready for the entrees you're already pretty full.   The Margaritas are also very good, so Lindo's is a good place for a date night with perfect views accompanied by delicious Mexican food and a mariachi band."}
{"text":"No bueno last 3 times. We've been here 4 times, each time, the service gets worst. Why does it take so long to get and close out checks? Last time, it took f o r e v e r. The time before that, it was slightly less than forever. Today, never once were our water glasses refilled. We left 2 EMPTY water glasses on top of the bill. Seems to be that the B Team works the area near the windows. If our waiter sucks (Maybe new? Overwhelmed? Incompetent?) and your other waiters know and have been staring at customers (us) waiting f o r e v e r for the check, maybe those waiters standing around trying not to make eye contact, should simply do the right thing and just get our check? Don't you think that's a better look? We only asked 2 of you who were completely not busy to help us get our check when our waiter went MIA f o r e v e r. Good luck, you'll find us at another Mexican restaurant from now on."}
{"text":"Hostess said it would be 20 to 25 minutes for a table. We waited over an hour. I would have gone somewhere else if I had known the wait was going to be that long. The food is not worth the wait. VERY LOUD. We Boulder envelop talk to each other."}
{"text":"The food was good but not as great as the Lindo on Desert Inn.  Service was as expected great!"}
{"text":"I have driven past this Restaurant for many years and just have not had a chance to eat here.   A friend of mine suggested this place for lunch.. I was not disappointed.. The table side freshly guacamole is outstanding.. The freshest and best I have ever had.. My steak entree ..was cooked perfect.. The grilled flavor and what ever they seasoned the steak with..OMG.. So very tender do not need a knife to cut into it..My margarita was yummy..   From the greeting at the door to the service staff and atmosphere.. Give you a A+++  I Will return again and only 10 minutes from where I live..  Make a reservation.. They are very busy.."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great margaritas! Great service! Food is always filling and full of flavor. No complaints whatsoever. Love the Mole enchiladas and the bottomless chips, beans and salsa!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Even after coming in on a busy Friday night with my spouse , the wait was minimal and service was great. They give you large portions of food (not to mention the soup, chips , bean, and salsa dips they give you while you wait for your food).   We were nicely greeted when we came in as well as when we were walking out. Everyone was very attentive making sure we had everything we needed and checked on us to make frequently.  Would definitely come back and recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a good Mexican dine in restaurant ."}
{"text":"Our party of 4 had a pre-birthday dinner here on a crazy busy Saturday. We snagged a nice table on the \"patio\" overlooking the Strip. I had the pork chops special, which was reasonably priced and had 2 eggs & beans/rice with it. Also tortillas! A very good entree!  We had the tableside guac also, which you customize to your taste, and that was very tasty & fresh! I was pleased when \"beer girls\" came around offering a sample and a $2.75 bottle special!  That is always a nice bonus.  I also tried the shrimp cocktail, which lacked flavor (needed something spicy, cocktail sauce, etc.) but the shrimp were plentiful and good. Our friend was serenaded for her birthday and got a free shot & churros! Very nice."}
{"text":"the outside and parking lot even has a greatview.  the view isbeautifulsit near the window.  the food is excellent and service isgood  recommend for lunch or dinner   great location"}
{"text":"When in Vegas this is a must. Food is reasonably priced, and service is excellent. Drinks are delicious as well. I live in East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights and this place is better than half the joints in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My new spot for Mexican food! So good, great service, friendly staff, delicious food!! Recommend to everyone, but must go to this location."}
{"text":"Daniel is seriously the best waiter I've ever had! He was nice and extremely helpful. Also not that bad of looker either :) The food was delicious and the drinks were on pointe! I love the look and feel of this place! Also you feel like familia here because the staff is so sweet and friendly. It's worth your trip off the strip to dine here! For sure making this is a staple every time I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food is great, very authentic. I am Mexican and know good Mexican food. The staff is very polite and social. I highly recommend dining here, the view beats all of the other locations. Make sure you book a reservation when coming in on a weekend."}
{"text":"I like this place, always lively here, and never dead. The service here is flawless, my beans are always hot with my chips, drinks are always refilled without asking. Can't beat it. I always get the Mango frozen Margarita, very tasteful. I've tasted pretty much everything here, I like the shrimp plates with their homemade tortillas. Fried ice cream for dessert is always a winner! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and at various times and this place is busy but seating is quick.  Service is the best, better than in many high priced joints.  Never an empty water glass or beer glass for that matter.  The beer is always cold and served in a great chilled glass.  Lelt me counter a previous poster - I am from Cali and I love this place.  Fantastic and varied menu so anyone should be able to satisfy their Mexican food desires.  Every entree I've had has been tops and the tortillas are like those made at home, light, fluffy, warm and downright excellent.  I could make a meal out of them!  Very good sopapillas if you have room for dessert.  This is no doubt one of the best Mexican restaurants we have been to in the entire southwest.  Anyone posting less than 4 stars wouldn't know a tortilla from a tomahawk."}
{"text":"Yesterday was packed for Cinco de Mayo! I was told by a friend that it's always hard to get in so make reservations. I order our dinner for takeout and was not disappointed. The food was delicious. I ordered a # 7 and #4 with a chicken chimichanga. I have never had a chimichanga like that! Everything about it was fresh, huge, and delicious. My cheese enchiladas were not skimped over on the cheese! Wow I was very impressed on the quality of the food. For one there were at least 40 people waiting to be seated on top of a full restaurant and they still managed to not under do the gourmet quality of our dinner.  5 stars guys! I will most definitely return!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in 13 years, this place used to be the best. Now not so much, after being seated we waited a long time before our waiter acknowledged us. Many wait staff walked by and nobody offered us a drink of water. Then the patron in the table in front of us walks to the register to complain about something and they go find \"our\" waiter. He then stopped at her table and they conversed and he left again still no drinks or anything. I'm starting to get annoyed. Then several minutes later he brought her cocktail and she decided she wants to talk his ear off and yet he's looking at us and not making the effort to end the conversation. Finally I started making loud comments were talking 10 minutes without any service, it wasn't busy either. He finally comes to us, we placed our order. Then that chick gets up like every few minutes to speak with the hostess and a manager comes to her table and she talks her ear off. Then a random patron starts conversation with her and she says how she's a stripper lol   -fast forward-  Our food arrives I had combination plate chile relleno and taco. The chile relleno was disappointing the sauce wasn't good no flavor, like a can of crushed tomatoes was dumped on it. The taco had half a cup of shredded cheese and lettuce not much to it. My husband had fajitas they were mediocre . Not once did our waiter check on us, the guy with the refills was the only one doing his job.  Conclusion: this place isn't what it used to be with quality, service and price increases don't coincide with this place. Thumbs down"}
{"text":"We stopped in this afternoon for margaritas and a lite snack.... this was my first time to this location, but I am definitely a Lindo fan from visits to the other locations! We sat at the bar and I LOVE the view, the service was great, they were very attentive but yet let us have our space to relax.... we enjoyed a few margaritas and enjoyed the wonderful chips and salsa (the salsa seemed spicier than normal today- which we LOVED!) and I am a huge fan of the bean dip they have as well.   Lindo Michoacan is always a great choice!"}
{"text":"Lindo has some really delicious options! Great margaritas!  And...they have wonderful efficient service!    We have dined at Lindo a few times now and I have enjoyed every visit. They also have live music which is very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I had heard from a few people that the food at Lindo had \"gone down hill\" for a while. I had some relatives in town who love the place so we went last night. It was a great experience! Luckily we made reservations as it was packed full at 5:30. We were given a prime table on the windows behind the bar with that incredible view of the valley and strip below. Our server Martin provided outstanding service to us even though every table was full.   Of course we started with margaritas and their fantastic guacamole which is made table side. 3 people ordered the Camarones abuelito timo which are large shrimp with cheese and peppers, wrapped in bacon and then fried. Hard to go wrong with that! They were great. Others had fajitas, enchiladas and the pescado Vallarta which is fish cooked in olive oil, wine, peppers, garlic and onions. She said it was \"fabulous\". Of course we ended with flan and fried ice cream.   I took some pictures but by then the Patron margaritas had kicked in and they didn't come out to well :)  It may not be the most authentic mexican food in town, but I think Lindo does a great job and with a perfect location up on Horizon Ridge. If you haven't been in a while, give them another try."}
{"text":"wow went there a few hours ago and loved it. we got seated immediately. customer service was great. the table side guacamole was lovely! my new spot. food was yummy as well"}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant this week to celebrate me getting a Job, so me and my hubby drive about 20 min to get there, and the restaurant looks nice people were very helpful.    The bad thing was with the food....My hubby had the Arrachera meat which was hard, dry and stiff he had a hard time even pulling it apart, his corn tortillas were not good, and the beans seemed to be from a can or something...I know my beans...Yes, I'm Mexican and a great cook according to every single person that has ever tasted my food..    As for me, well I had the Carnitas platter with the flour tortillas....The carnitas were stiff, over fried pieces of pork meat, and dry also...So was I dissapointed  \"YES\"...The good thing was the salsa had OK taste and the Flour Tortillas were GREAT I know they are hand made because I make some a few times a week at home myself.  So I gave 1 star for place being nice including the server, and the other for the salsa and tortillas....but ok...After paying 70 dlls for good flour tortillas and salsa ONLY...I figure I could have made my tortillas for about 2.00 at home and a good salsa for another 2.00.  HMMM...maybe I should think about opening a REAL AUTHENTIC Mexican restaurant myself. :-)"}
{"text":"the food was pretty good, not as good as the twain/decatur location.. that's the only reason for the additional star.. the customer service was really, REALLY bad.. i didn't mind waiting for a table because it was indeed busy but the service i received once me & my child was seated was horrible.. my waitor paid no attention to us whatsoever, we weren't checked on in over 30 minutes as i watched him check on all other tables near us, i never received my check that i asked for.. i just had to do my best at calculating and left money on the table.. i won't return to this location, i should've stuck to the decatur location.!"}
{"text":"Out of all of the Michoacan-themed restaurants around the valley, I go to the La Loma Lindo location the most often since I live in Henderson. It's a solid bet when I feel like having some super delicious chicken -- I've had every chicken dish on their menu and found you can't go wrong with any of them. My favorites are the gallo al mojo de ajo, pollo sarandeado, and pollo al tomate. I'm a sauce fanatic, and the sauce on all three of these dishes is to die for! The carnitas are also pretty super, and tender enough to fall apart at the touch of your fork. The portions are enormous on almost all of these dishes -- every time, I can pretty much get 3 meals out of whatever I order, making it a fantastic deal for a moderately-priced restaurant.  Other things I like about this Lindo are the ease of getting a table (I've never made reservations and have never had to wait more than 10-15 mins for a table, even when they're super packed); all of the choices of margaritas (their skinny margarita is actually the closest most places come to offering an actual \"real\"/classic margarita); and the view, which is especially awesome after sunset. Service is also pretty decent and super quick most of the times I've gone. Also, if you call in a to-go order, they'll actually also give you the cup of fideo soup AND the beans/salsa and chips they'd give you if you were actually dining there, which most places definitely wouldn't do if you were ordering take-out.   Drawbacks are the noise (this location gets really loud to begin with, acoustically, but then one of the dudes playing keyboard & singing comes on and you can't even hear yourself think, much less hear your dinner companion speaking) and the beef dishes (I've tried a couple, and both times the meat was tough & not very flavorful, in spite of the other flavorful ingredients).  If you're in Henderson and you're looking for flavorful Mexican food that deviates from the standard burrito/taco/quesadilla offerings, you shouldn't be disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"Very well decorated large family friendly restaurant with full bar. Great food reasonable prices decent service. Always a pleasing experience"}
{"text":"One of the best places in Vegas! I'm so happy that we came here!  We ordered the guacamole, and it was made table side. It was amazing. Super fresh and flavor-filled. I appreciate how we could request the spicy level.   Not knowing many authentic Mexican dishes, I ordered chicken fajita. I was kind of bummed because I generally don't like fajitas, but I was wrong! This fajita was the best I ever had, and I'm so glad I got it! The chicken was so good that I could eat it by itself. The meal came with rice, refried beans, sour cream and guacamole. The tortillas are also made fresh. All perfect with my meal. Big enough to feed two small ladies like myself; in retrospect, I should have shared it.  I forgot what the dessert we ordered was called, but it was basically vanilla ice cream covered in crunchy flakes, caramel, and cinnamon. It was covered in rum and then lit on fire in ordered for it to caramelize. Very strong rum flavor, so don't get it if you don't like alcohol.   If I ever come back to Vegas, I definitely will come back here. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Killer Mexican food here I have no idea how they have such a low rating this should be 5 stars period"}
{"text":"The entire process is dialed in - doors held open at start & end, quick chips / salsa / water, amazing food. Recommend the shrimp ceviche."}
{"text":"Come here every time I goto Vegas bomb Mexican food great queso fundido with chorizo and homemade flour tortillas"}
{"text":"Simply the best Mexican food we have found in the Vegas valley."}
{"text":"Just in this past Friday evening we got seated immediately and our waiter was pleasant. The Carna Asada was mouth watering delicious it literally melted in your mouth!   We had a window seat with a view of the entire valley which is amazing! Only bad part is the restaurant was freezing cold inside and I'm a guy that loves the cold! I guess it's better than being hot though. Haha!   Great food and a nice staff with an excellent view!"}
{"text":"I kept hearing about this place over and over again.  I finally went tonight.  Location is horrendous, but there was parking in front, and hostesses were dressed up and smiling.  The waitstaff, bussers, everyone who helped us were unbelievably friendly, my server was helpful I left a 30% tip, and loved the mariachi band  (Or was that just playing over head?) This place exceeded my expectation I love the food, the soup was to die for I even got seconds with I additional charge.  I'm bringing my whole family back!"}
{"text":"Great view, pretty good food, we left very full and happy :). My bf got the grilled shrimp with garlic and I had the fish soup. I was very pleased with the amount of seafood in my soup. The fideo is always yummy and I love their salsa. Very good place, we will be back."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this place from a few people so after attempting to try frank and fina's Mexican Cocina (which was closes when I gt there) I decided to travel across the street to get my Mexican food fix taken care of.   Decor is nice, authentic and the service was mediocre. Waiter was polite but it was one of those feelings like he was smiling his ass off through his teeth, hiding his horrible day and unhappiness.   I'm not sure if this is a complaint but.. their menu selection made cheesecake factory's look like in-n-out's. Just.. Wayy too much. Strange that I'm talking about this but I had to tell the waiter about 4 times that I needed \"just another minute\". I ended up ordering a combination plate of a wet, enchilada style carnitas burrito, corn tamales and chile releteno. My friend ordered a chicken fajita plate.   When I took a bite of my burrito, I felt as if they had microwaved something bought out of a supermarket. The temperature was way off, there were many parts of the inside that were barely room temperature. The tamale was bland, and the chile reletno was mediocre. My friends chicken fajita didn't even come out sizzling. He also said it was cold and the chicken was very dry.   Would have gave a 2 star if the service was great and the prices were reasonable, but at almost $20 per person after tax and tip I was left extremely dissatisfied.  Maybe the other original location can do it right."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and servings are huge. The chips and soup to start with are delicious and margaritas are very tasty"}
{"text":"Holy guacamole.   Or maybe holy beans and chips would be more appropriate? They bring you that, along with some salsa as soon as you sit down and boy, it's delicious. No need to order dinner based of how much beans I ended up eating...  1. I highly suggest the guava margarita. HIGHLY suggest. $10 and its huge.   2. Their menus huge. I knew I was gonna be full of chips so I ordered a taco and enchilada a la carte and the portion was perfect.   I have wanted to try this place for ages (Vegas locals always come here) and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"There are so many fantastic things I can say about this restaurant. First off, AMAZING view during the night. Second of all, the food is lovely. They kept the salsa and chips flowing as we had our beers. Ordering was easy (they even allowed us some swaps) and the wait and bus staff was not only super-genial and accommodating, but whoever hired them has a touch for the dramatic. So many handsome guys all in one place!! A lot of restaurants in the area shove you out after you finish eating, not here. We stayed over an hour after the meal and there was absolutely no pressure to leave. Quite a wonderful place for a family dinner, a date, or just anything... it's special for any occasion!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Yum, yum, yum!  Salsa:  yum, Chips: yum. I had two cheese enchiladas, 1 red, 1 green - with rice. I loved every bit of it. Plus, had a sopailla for the first time. It was delicious. A+. Good find Vaughn."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming. One of my travel mates got a recommendation for Lindo's so we decided to try it out. The place was deceptively far from the strip, via rideshare, which wouldn't have been an issue with great food. The food was decent but not at all great. There was live music and the singer was good. If you want atmosphere, good service and decent food this is an okay spot. But definitely not a \"must go\" when in Vegas place."}
{"text":"We just flew into Las Vegas and had to have Mexican and dropped into the e Sahara location. It was Thursday about 3:00pm and we were starving. Our waiter Daniel was excellent and friendly. The chicken taquitos were soo good and  just the right amount of crunch.  We had the fried fish and it was perfectly cooked, crispy skin and done just right. Also had the light garlic butter sauce with wine on the side for dipping. My buddy had the grilled chicken with salt, pepper, and lemon juice and it was moist and tender. Everything was delicious, tasty and filling. Fun atmosphere and everyone was happy and friendly. Good timing for us because by the time we left, the restaurant started filling up with people."}
{"text":"Love this place come here every time we are in Vegas. Best micheladas and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Normally half way decent but not tonight.   Deserving of one star.   Chips over cooked.  Shredded beef in flautas and tacos no flavor. Never had anything so bland"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful !!! We went as a large party of 22, and we were taken care very well. Our waiters Christian and Angel were kind and helpful and knew what we needed before we did. Another STAR of the experience was NOE one of the managers. Always made sure we were well taken care of. We are all looking forward to returning , and making apart of our traditions. Thank you Lindo Michoacan from the hostess, managers, waiters, helpers, and even the mariachi's the night was magical. Gracias por todo, La Familia VEGA"}
{"text":"Very highly recommended I come from California and this is yet the best Mexican restaurant the chips and salsa love the presentation the waiters are very attentive very nice. The food is delicious love how Mexican the restaurant looks"}
{"text":"My mom and I come here everytime we are in Vegas! It is our go to mexican food spot. They have the best steak plates. I can't remember the exact name but it starts with \"buey\" something. Its ribeye steak with AMAZING green sauce. This last time we were there we got the ship ceviche and it was delicious. We will keep coming back here whenever we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Fresh made guacamole?! Made right in front of you. Swear they make their food with crack, it's so addicting! Come here for any occasion. It's an upbeat and fun atmosphere. Casual and real."}
{"text":"I've been here on a few occasions. The interior of the restaurant is really dim, especially in the day time. You might need the light from your cell phone to light up the menu if you don't happen to have bat vision. Service is great. The moment we walked in the door, the hostess greeted us warmly and seated us at a table of our choosing. A moment later we were seated our waiter and busboy both came by to take our drink order and bring us chips, respectively. Our drinks never went empty and our server was always ready to fulfill all our requests.   It's definitely not my favorite Mexican food in town, the spice level is definitely toned down and I wish the flavors were just a little more dynamic. I have ordered quite a few things off the menu and have never really been blown away flavor wise, but it's definitely solid. On this occasion, I ordered a shredded chicken burrito, which was huge for the price. It definitely needed more flavor, but it was still a pretty good meal.   I'd be back, if I'm in the area again... I'll just make sure to ask for extra chile or spicier salsa on the side."}
{"text":"I have been to Lindo Michoacan on previous occasions and had pleasant dining experiences, but I was never really blown away by the food. On this most recent visit, I came with Groupon in hand and I have to say it made me a believer.  I ordered the Chuletas de Cerdo Estilo. These pork chops were perfection. The flavors were on point and they were cooked well. Many places overcook pork chops, but these were moist and flavorful. My fella ordered the two burrito combination plate. He chose the green chile pork with beans and a red chile beef burrito. The green chile burrito was addictive. The flavors were absolutely delightful. They danced in my mouth and made me eat quite a bit more than I should have. Next time I'm ordering this dish with both two green chile burritos instead of just the one.  The prices are reasonable considering what you get. I can't believe I've finally found a good Mexican restaurant in town by revisiting a place I had written off in the past! Service was friendly and beyond efficient. We never had a glass go half empty and our chips and dips were always filled to the brim."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was quite pleasant. That's the only reason for 2 stars, because the food.... Big MEH.  We had heard all the rave reviews. Methinks these people have never been to California and tasted what real fresh Mex is like. Lindo Michoacan is NOT all that. Most of the stuff is pure canned flavor.  Save yourself the trip. Head over to Mandalay Bay and get some decent food at the Border's Grill."}
{"text":"4 stars on service! 3 stars on food!  The service and attention in this place is great, no doubt. But I got to say, the food is not all that authentic to me... Don't get me wrong, it's good, just can't compare 100% to \"real\" Mexican food."}
{"text":"Service was very slow and not really attentive at all. Food was average at best, definitely seemed to be lacking flavor. The upside is the view, you just can't beat it. Margaritas were probably the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Save your money and save your stomache.  My father, husband and I went here in January.   It was an insulting experience.  1. The lighting was so low that my father had to request a flashlight to read the menu. The waiter actually REFUSED and said the owner liked it dark.  Then about 30 minutes later he came back with one (after I read the menu for my dad and we had ordered).  Who tells a 70 year old man \"no you can't have a flashlight to read the menu because the owner likes it dark in here?\"  2. My husband recieved the wrong order and tried to eat it thinking that all mexican food is good.  It wasn't so he didn't even eat a quarter of it.  3. My meal, the shrimps, were charred on the outside and raw on the inside.   I had two shrimp and of course couldn't eat anymore.  I actually got sick at home.  I asked to speak with the manager and he or she never came.    I paid my bill because I didn't want to be accused of dine and dash.     I went to the hostess and asked to speak with the manager.  The place was too busy, again, the manager never came.  So I went home  That night I went to their facebook and wrote them a message asking for a response or I would go to my bank for a claim.   They never got back to me.  I filed a claim with my bank and of course it was denied.   Lindo Michoacan LIED to my bank and said we completed our meals and that we NEVER asked for a manager.   They pointed out I left a tip.   Of course I left a tip, I am not going to punish the waiter for the Chefs poor cooking or the Managers refusal to deal with a customer complaint.  I am also not going to leave a bill unsettled and be acuse of a crime.   Lindo Michoacan LIED about me not writing them a message on their facebook.    This establishment has bad food, poor service and unethical management - this type of establishment is bad for our community and for our recovering economy.  Who wants to have a lying crapy restaruant in their town?"}
{"text":"I recommend this place to everyone the food is really good it reminded me of my grandmas rice and the guacamole is great come and enjoy with the family and friends you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Wow. I asked the Uber driver to take me somewhere off the strip for a nice Mexican dinner. She did not star us wrong. Steak Picado and steak fajitas were phenomenal. If you ever want a dinner off the stip, take the ride to Lindo Michoacan."}
{"text":"First off if you have a shirt that says save water drink margaritas, bring me the margarita I order. Service was horrible! Guy barely spoke English and couldn't understand us. Got a combo 13 which I know was just a green pork burrito by itself. It came with a chicken enchilada. By far the worst enchilada I have ever tasted!! It's called salt and pepper for the chicken and the sauce tasted burnt.  Juans Flaming Fajitas please come to Henderson."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better family friendly Mexican restaurants in LV. From their yummy Fideo Soup to the lady making the homemade tortillas in the back. This one is a must try!!"}
{"text":"A definite must for authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas. Service was awesome and even though I arrived without a reservation very close to dinner time my party was promptly accommodated. The complimentary bean dip they bring out with the chips and salsa is incredible. The crunchy taco appetizer was delicious, the Coca Cola carnitas were amazing, and the Chile relleno like no other I've ever had stateside. The service was great and super friendly. Horchata and other freshly made drinks available with unlimited refills. Best Mexican fix ever!!"}
{"text":"Lindo Michoacan is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas! The horchata is free refill; they always bring chips and salsa and bean dip. If you like spicy, ask for the habanero salsa! They have so many lunch specials too! I have been to both the original location and the Henderson location (which has a spectacular view!) I had the adobada taco dinner and my boyfriend had a chimichanga dinner. Both were super delicious and came with rice/beans and there noodle soup. Portions are large, and evreything is home made. Including the tortillas! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I usually eat at this place once at month and I have a good meal for a fair price (70$ minimum every time I eat there), but today our server got my order wrong not once but twice (how can you mess up in a salad man) I saw the server talking to the manager and not even the manager stop by the table once to check if the order was right ,the restaurant wasn't busy it all and the runner just drop the food and took off ,smh very disappointed. Yes they did charge me for the salad without asking me if there was a problem with it, the only reason I used to go there it's because they had a decent costumer service well not anymore I guess from now on I will have to drive to the aria and eat at Javier's ."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times at the one in spring valley which is always good. Have been to this one several times only having the table side guacamole with Margaritas. I brought my family in tonight from out of town visiting and we were all so disappointed in the food. All of the food we ordered was flavorless and the chicken was so over cooked , the enchiladas I ordered barely had any cheese on it and again was flavorless and the chicken extremely dry. We had waited to eat all day and splurge on dinner , was a super disappointment. I will be finding a New Mexican Restaurant , the only appeal this one has is the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating at Lindo Michoac√°n. I ordered a sangria which was made too sweet. I couldn't taste the wine at all. For our entrees, I ordered the Tilapia with a sauce that our waiter recommended and my sister ordered a shrimp dish that had an orange-red sauce ( I can't remember the name) My tilapia cost about $15 and had no flavor. Very bland. The shrimp dish was over $20 and wasn't that great for the price. Also the shrimps were tiny. I thought this place was going to be good since it had so many great reviews but it wasn't. It's way too over priced. The quality, flavor, and price made me give this place a 2 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Food was 4 stars and 5 stars for service.   They were so attentive from the moment we entered the restaurant.  Even when they messed up our margaritas they were quick to fix it and even took one drink off the bill and asked if they could get us anything else.  We took a cab there and when we we getting ready to leave they asked if we'd like to use their shuttle back to the strip.  Overall, I was really amazed how well we were  treated.  I was so impressed by the service I could barely focus on the food but it was good."}
{"text":"Food was okay nothing special. Carne asada was tasteless very disappointed but the rice and beans were good. The salsa wasn't good at all. Fideo was tasty, the flour tortillas seemed to be a little undercooked. Nice place to have a few drinks.  Beautiful view of the Strip."}
