{"text":"Tasty Delight has been at the Finch & Leslie Square for years, under various names, but the food has always been the same -- Hong Kong Cafe food, mixing Chinese stir-fry dishes with steaks and other Western fare.  The food here ranges from average to great.  Its lemongrass pork chops are maybe the best I've had anywhere, better than the Xe Lua Vietnamese/Thai restaurant in the same mall.  The black-pepper chicken steak is slightly above average, with a sauce that's hot but not fragrant enough, but the texture of the chicken steak is good.  The mixed steak platter is a bit disappointing, with the sausage being pretty mediocre, and it's filling but not especially delicious.  However, one big plus of this place is the service.  The staff is more friendly than at most other Chinese eateries, and seating is pretty comfortable."}
{"text":"The new restaurant is owned by the same owner as the previous restaurant - Leslie Cafe. The waitress who served us has very bad attitude. Bad customer service. We ordered the most typical HK style curry rice with beef brisket, it tasted so bland and it took them forever to cook. We also ordered beef satay noodle ... Again , very bland.... We are done with Tasty Delight , ex Leslie Cafe."}
{"text":"This is kind of a go-to hangout for me. They have some of the best HK style milk tea in the city. The food is decent enough but is certainly at a justifiable price point. Good spot for breakfast and afternoon tea with accompanying menus to boot."}
{"text":"This replacement of Leslie Cafe improved on the service, and the decor.  However, the prices do reflect upon the better decor.  The food is on par with what it was before, but you do get complimentary soup and dessert if you eat with 4 people.  Overall, a good improvement."}
{"text":"I was there at 10:00 am for breakfast on July 22, 2017.  I ordered the breakfast instant noodle soup with luncheon meat and egg.  The first order contained a medium size fly in the dish.  They took it back and said they will make another one for me.  The second one came and there was a cockroach in it.  I'm disgusted!  I snapped a photo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxRk9lzsx3NQZ0VBQ25BNnQ3S1J1a2I4UFM5QkxiNUQxa0lR/view?usp=sharing"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. I stepped in 9:30pm. And they say they are still open.   Because i don't have cash and my order is below $10,  and because kitchen closed at 9:40pm and I can't order more, they let me pay before seeing food and charge $1.5 card process fee.   Moreover, by 9:50pm their cleaner started using mop to wipe floor with very disgusting disinfectant smell, before my finish.   I know you guys want to go home early, but why not close your door at 9pm if you don't want to serve?"}
{"text":"Found a huge bug in the noodle! So gross! Totally ruined the morning on New Year's Eve"}
{"text":"Showed up for breakfast with parents. The prices here a bit higher than Leslie Cafe, but the food seems to be better quality. The menu is good, but they ran out of hash browns (sad face!), and didn't offer anything for replacement - an upgrade to condensed milk toast would've been nice.  I ordered a macaroni soup with spam and condensed milk toast. We also had two other breakfast meals (one with eggs and spam and toast - and no hashbrown), and one egg and meat sandwich.  The service here is good - they're attentive and fast, but seemed to mix up orders every now and then. Overall, a pass. If you visit before April 22nd, there' 15% off as part of their grand opening."}
{"text":"I came here with some family around 6:30pm. They were a bit busy with their dinner rush. The wait wasn't too long but they gave us menus and a piece of paper to write our orders down to speed up the process. They have the traditional Hong Kong style \"western meals\" as well as the Asian dishes on their menu.   Service was mediocre.  Food: My uncle ordered spam, eggs and rice - which no one could possibly mess up so its a safe choice.   My aunt ordered the curry chicken with rice - the curry was horrible! There was no curry taste. Asians love their rice and can tell the difference between stale and fresh rice... Let's just say this is now on the list of worst rice we've ever had.   I ordered this seafood pasta with cream sauce - it was HORRIBLE, BLAND AND DISGUSTING. I couldn't finish it.   Never again."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. Originally ordered the bolognese. Once it arrived, I started mixing the sauce and the noodles and became aware of a burnt odor. I smelled the dish and it had a very strong burnt smell. The staff was nice about replacing the dish but they said the bolognese was supposed to have a burnt taste....I did try one bite of the dish and it literally tasted like they burnt the bottom of the pot black and the black smoke had seeped into the sauce. I really hope that it's not intentional as the burnt smell was quite strong. Otherwise, the other dishes were OK."}
{"text":"Neither tasty nor delightful  I am a big fan of their other location at don mills and finch, but dinner here was a miss.  Yes it's better than the old Leslie Cafe but that is a low bar...food took a half hour to arrive (to which the waitress response was 'well, other tables have to wait too') and the food was bland, especially our pepper beef on sizzling plate which was rubbery and tasteless.  Owner is very nice and seemed receptive to our comments so maybe we will come back at some point to see if there is improvement but they are in my penalty box for now"}
{"text":"This place is sooooo much better than the place that was previously here (Leslie cafe). The food is great and they give you free soup and dessert. Service is attentive and nice. Love their breakfast too!"}
{"text":"Tasty Delight has replaced the formed Leslie Cafe, and I must say it has made a decent transition.   This cafe is your typical Hong Kong style of what you expect. The food is good. There are the typical dishes of what you would normally find in this type of restaurant (Baked Rice, Noodle Soups, Milk Tea, etc).  The prices for any dish is reasonable, you will pay for what you expect.   The service was quite efficient, the waiters were very attentive and a pleasure to talk with.   Overall, if you are looking for a quick bite to eat at a decent price. then check out Tasty Delight Fusion House."}
{"text":"Came in today for afternoon tea, ordered a lemon water and bacon egg sandwich. They ended up serving me a lemon tea instead, which I didn't complain about, but it tasted pretty bad. And the egg sandwich was pretty bleh too, really dry. The only stars here are for the staff, they were really nice and even kept my takeaway sandwich for me when I forgot it."}
{"text":"Extra star for service. Had combo c for dinner and all the dishes were good. As described in Chinese, there was enough \"wok hay\"."}
{"text":"This cafe is located in what was formerly also a hong kong cafe. They simply redid the name and decor. And increased the price a bit. In terms of food this place is decent.   Went to this place before for lunch. And today for breakfast. The breakfast is priced same as other hong kong places avereage meal is 5-7 dollars and includes a hot drink. Overall a good deal when you compare it to western breakfast joint where average meal runs you a lot more. Now the food was not bad. However i would not say its spectacular. The service is fast and efficent like all hong kong cafe joints are usually.   I would recommend for anyone just want some hong kong food comfort food as it is a servicable restaurant that wont cost you an arm or leg"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good Chinese food (cafe styles), definitely come here to get it in generous portions at an affordable price! The people working here know how to do it, fast and done with smiles. Lots of weekday deals as well as a good breakfast menu. Located in a convenient plaza which has a chinese grocery store attached...can do your shopping all in one go!"}
{"text":"My other reviews still stand. This one is specifically for breakfast. They only serve breakfast and noodles in soup (with the exception of braised beef) before 11am, which is when the chef comes in. Most of their other menu pages do say that these are not served before 11am, but there are other pages that do not have time restrictions on them, and I thought these would be available. I was wrong.  Their breakfast menu is fairly limited. They also have no room for substitutions. I ordered a combo that included luncheon meat with macaroni in soup and condensed milk on toast ($4.75). This also came with a drink. I wanted instant noodles instead of macaroni, because I do not like macaroni in soup. I told my parents my order, and went to grab a few groceries. I got back just in time to see them put macaroni in soup down on our table. My parents then told me that they did not do substitutions. They couldn't just upcharge me for the noodles? I mean, they have instant noodles with other available menu items. Taste-wise, the luncheon meat and macaroni in soup was exactly what I expected. I ended up adding chili oil and ketchup. The condensed milk on toast was a bit of a shocker. I'm a sucker for condensed milk on toast. I'm also accustomed to getting two slices of bread when I order this at other places. This is a sandwich. Today, it was once slice of toast with a a small amount of condensed milk drizzled on. It was also served open-faced, but cut in half. I ended up making my own sandwich out of the two halves. The two middle bites did taste like condensed milk on toast, but the rest of it just tasted mostly like bread. Disappointing. Oh. The macaroni in soup was small too.  Four of us were at breakfast. We ended up ordering two meals. We received one spoon, one fork, one knife, and two napkins. We asked for bowls, and we were given one bowl. We then asked for another one. My macaroni meal came first. That one came with just a spoon (Yeah. Our spoon, fork, and knife were for two different meals). I can eat my macaroni and my luncheon meat with a spoon, but that's when I'm being lazy at home and I don't want to wash extra cutlery. If I'm at a restaurant and especially if I'm expected to pay tips, I would hope I get more than just a spoon to eat luncheon meat with. Mindblown.  Oh. Right. We have a VIP card. We paid for it a while back. It gets us 10% off. Apparently, breakfast does not count in this. Not cool.  I will do what I can to avoid breakfast here, especially if it's close to 11am. I'd rather wait for another restaurant to open.  Aside: Thing that happened. I do not blame the restaurant for this. There was a couple at the table next to us. The man had sausage, eggs, and hash browns. He was cutting his sausage, and a piece shot off and landed in my personal bubble. Actually in my personal bubble. It was on the floor about two inches away from my jacket. Um... yeah."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant in the morning for an easy breakfast. i went with a friend, and ordered a breakfast of  Beef congee and deep fried dough. The breakfast in general was pretty average, it was not especially good or bad. the deep fried dough was pretty good. and the portion was fare, given the price they charged. I think the overall impression i have of this hong kong style cafe, which they like to call fusion, is that it is exactly what it advertise. Casual hong kong comfort food, with no hassle and a affordable price.   I would recommend to others in the area if they have a craving for hong kong style food or breakfast, and simply would like a not so expensive meal.   The service was also friendly and efficient, which made the experience relatively enjoyable"}
{"text":"I found out their best waitress, Jeanette quit. The service today was absolutely horrid. They didn't even explain themselves. All they could say was sorry. I was there with my three kids and my wife and we had to wait 40 minutes to find out they didn't put the order in properly.  It's not like this was our first time at the place.  Actually we've been here so many times we considered it our kitchen away from home.  I will never return. Disgusted."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Tasty Delight. I tend to stay away from HK Cafes. Oddly enough, it's because of the variety. I have this theory that any place that does THAT many things must not be very good at one thing. However, this small Cantonese restaurant is always packed for lunch so I figured I give it a shot.   We ordered Clams in Black Bean Sauce, Hot and Spicy Beef with Vermicelli Hot Pot, and Tiger Prawns Fried Rice in Lotus Leaf (I didn't realize how long the dish names were...). The clams were huge! The sauce used wasn't the best, but the clams were large and meaty. The Hot and spicy beef hot pot had tender slices of beef with mounds of vermicelli noodles and peppers. It's served on a elevated pot that is heated by blue rocks. The Tiger Prawns Fried Rice was done very well. It's served and steamed inside a lotus leaf so you get that fragrance from the lotus leaf without it damaging the taste of the rice. This rice was a bit too soft for my liking, but it has a wonderful garlicky flavor and so do the jumbo shrimp that come with them.   The service here was stellar. You don't normally get uber friendly service at these Cantonese places, but our server was outgoing and friendly. Constantly making jokes and just reminded me of my mother a bit too much. Definitely worth stopping by. Even if you don't know what to get, they pretty much have everything..."}
{"text":"I am so glad Tasty Delight took over what was previously known as Leslie Cafe. Food is amazing and the prices are fair.  This restaurant gives you quality and quantity. For dinner, if you go with at least 4 people, you will usually get complimentary soup and dessert. They allow you to bring your own seafood and they can cook it for you for $10/plate.  Service is AMAZING. Everyone is so polite with great manners and they smile all the time."}
{"text":"This place offers comfy Hong Kong cafe food. When me and my friend in North York and don't want to think where to eat, we will come here.   I always order lemongrass pork chop. I've at least come here 10 times and had this dish for 10 times, but still love it! It is tender, not greasy, has nice lemongrass fresh herbal aftertaste. Portion is huge. If I came here with girlfriend, we often share one dish. We have also ordered sizzling beef, also very delicious!   Crispy beef brisket in curry sauce is a very interesting dish. I didn't expect to see such fushion dish in this traditional old schooled restaurant. It tastes amazing!!!!! So soft inside and crispy outside!"}
{"text":"Was here for dinner and was surprise to see this new place.  I was like....where's lesile cafe????  First look at the menu, the price is more expensive.  I liked lesile cafe before for the price and quality.  This new place the quality is not bad.  i had the portuguese style chicken rice.  Lots of sauce which I liked but not much chicken and lots of rice.  For $10, I think you can get the same at any food court.  The service was amazing!! Very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"3.5 (extra 0.5 for service)  Tasty Fusion is now in the place where Leslie Cafe used to occupy.  If you ask me, the fusion part means fusion between a traditional Chinese restaurant and a HK style cafe.   Pros: Items from both Chinese restaurants and HK style cafe available  Food comes out quick  Cons: Prices are a bit higher  This was my first time here since Tasty Delight took over.  First thing to notice is the decor has completely changed for the better.  It feels like a family restaurant now.  There's more seating and the booths are much more comfortable than before.  It also has a much cleaner feel than before.  One look at the menu and you see that Tasty Fusion offers items you can find at both Chinese restaurants and HK style cafes.  This is great when you have a group where some people want to go one way and some want the other.  The menu is split up between the two as well.  As like HK stlye cafes, all items are that part of the menu come with a drink and soup.  The menu has a lot of items to choose from as well.  They even have a Chinese banquet style menu that you see at the larger Chinese restaurants, crazy!!  I ordered the baked chicken in cream sauce with cheese and spinach  and my GF got a won ton noodle.  The food comes out rather fast, I think we got both our orders well within 10 minutes of ordering.  Strangely, my baked rice came out before the won ton noodle.  Baked rice should take a lot longer to make??  Anyways, the presentation of the food here is well done.  For the most part, I liked my baked rice.  I would of preferred more of the sauce though.   It was mostly only over the chicken, there was barely any over the rice.  My GF's won ton noodle was well portioned.  You get 5 won tons that are made with all shrimp inside or at the very least, little to no filler at all.  The food overall was good, not the best, but well above serviceable.  The prices here are a bit higher than other places.  My baked rice went for $10.95.  I can get the same thing at other places for about $8-9 depending on the place.  It's a bit of a premium.  The service is excellent though.  As soon as they see you have a little one, they change up the bowls and utensils with child friendly ones.  They were pretty nice throughout the entire meal and were quick when you called.    I like the idea behind having a Chinese restaurant with a HK style cafe all in one.  You get a great experience albeit with a little bit of a pricing premium.  This one of the very few HK stlye cafe's in North York and it holds up well.  Seeing this is the closest HK style cafe to me, I will be back in the future."}
{"text":"Place with a decent meal with huge portions. Nothing extraordinary, but will definitely fill you up.  I have the Rice noodle with pickled veggies and pork."}
{"text":"Decent place. Pretty good hainanese chicken. The chicken fat/soup that usually comes with it is premixed into the rice. The iced sweet and sour pork is pretty good, tho its just sweet and sour pork with ice cubes on it. Its different, but nothing groundbreaking. The rest of the noodle dishes are okay, tho the noodles are a bit softer / not al dente. Overall, not a bad place."}
{"text":"It is really good . ..no joke.  ....today its my first time to come here with my girlfriend after food market(ing)  beside this restaurant.. ..and it turns out to be very good and im a bit conservative.  ..so i order a japanese chicken teriyaki on rice.. ...and with the price range $8-$9. ...it a lot to eat.  ..i can not even finish it.. .not just that.  ...the lady.  .i guess she is the owner (Rebecca)  she gave us both a bowl of soup for try.  ..and its pretty good...just only a bit too light.  ..anyways. .i will score 9 out of 10. ..that missing 1 score will be too far for me to come.  ..i personally live at downtown .  .thats why.  ..."}
{"text":"I'm never coming back here unless the restaurant changes the policies again. As of today? May 15th 2016 all of the set dinners (usually includes soup, drink & dessert w/ the entree) will only be served until 6pm! What's the point coming here now? I totally live for those! I know it's so the establishment can make more revenue with hopes of people ordering the big dishes but it's a little annoying. When our friends wanted to order anything with pork chop, nothing was available. Ahh.. why is this restaurant even opened? Going to look for other alternatives for fast dinner. Service was good. They were prompt and polite. Our table also got comp Chinese soup."}
{"text":"Came by for lunch and was able to try out the true selections.  They have a breakfast and tea time menu but do not have any lunch specials yet.  The baked rice and steel plate meals do come with soup and hit drink included.  I ordered the baked pork chop over rice with borsch soup and tea.  The soup was well flavoured, the rice dish was again very well cooked and the pork chop was very flavorful and not overly tenderized like many other cafe's.  The rice was also an egg fried rice which added nice texture.  Their portions are well sized and served hot.  The HK tea that came along was again well executed with good flavor and richness without being overly bitter.  The place was packed for lunch and had a little wait for dishes but overall, this is a nice change from the previous Leslie cafe that occupied the same space."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating there for breakfast and they make the best sunny side eggs and toast. The downside to this place is that when it's busy, the service is slow and the food often comes cold by the time it gets to our table."}
