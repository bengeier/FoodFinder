{"text":"Tried calling to place an order. Not a pleasant experience. Spoke with Nora who proceeded to have multiple conversations with multiple people while ignoring what I was saying and asking me to repeat myself over and over. She then proceeded to ask me to hold and started having another conversation mid order with someone who just walked into the building. For a brand new business, you may want to work on your customer service skills."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. After all the renovations to the building to equip the building for a pizza shop the owner did nothing but waste money and add a horrible pizza shop to a community who already has enough average to good pizza shops. I help back this review but after months of being open and many conversations with friends everyone I know has had a horrible experience. My steak hoagie was the worst I ever had the steak was cheap steak that wasn't even shredded like normal places do. He onions and green peppers were diced and raw and the bread tasted old. In a community filled with pizza shops don't waste your time. I've heard many great things about the Bethel Park location. But as far as this location goes it's dead in the water and I can't believe it's still opened with an incompetent staff and horrible food I would be ashamed if I was the owner of this business."}
{"text":"SO excited about Olive Oil's Pizzeria coming to Brookline. They have other locations in the Pittsburgh area and we had heard good things. We ordered delivery during their first week open. They delivered promptly and our delivery guy was really nice!!!   We got an italian calzone, breadsticks and provolone sticks. Oh my goodness the italian calzone was gorgeous. I've never said that about a calzone before but it was pretty instagrammable. And then it was delicious too!!! Very cheesy. Yum. The provolone sticks (mozzarella sticks) were also great- you can tell they're handmade because they were extra thick/crunch and ooey gooey melty. The breadsticks were my favorite! Simple, flavorful and delivered nice and warm.  We will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"This has been my go to pizza joint since it opened. Everyone has been very nice and considerate, and the delivery times are fast. I've loved every pizza we've ordered. The sandwiches I've had were ok, but a bit smaller than I'd like. Overall, a great addition to the Blvd."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place over our usual go-to. I was upset when I opened my side salad to find brown lettuce throughout the container. $4 thrown right in the trash. The pizza crust was over done on one side and undercooked on the other. We ordered a pepperoni pizza with onions and found it very greasy. My husband ordered a side of hot wings and said the sauce was pretty good. Overall disappointment."}
{"text":"Horrible costumer service!!! Ordered on phone my husband went to pick it up and they said they didn't have an order for us, as it wasn't placed there. I called to try to figure it out and there was a mix up in the kitchen and the woman told me it wasn't her problem since she just started her shift. I then asked to speak with the manager. And she was just like her employee. RUDE. I will Never buy from or support a business with horrible costumer service skills!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I thought this place had a little bit of a rocky start. We tried them the month they opened, and we were unimpressed. But I'm so glad we gave them a second chance just a couple months ago; I've been addicted ever since. The crust is perhaps the best pizza crust I've had in the Burgh (and I'm the type of gal that eats a pizza just for the crust). The service is always super quick and super kind. And what really sealed the 5th star for me is the sheer value. You can get serious deals here, so you don't risk much by giving them a shot! I'm so glad Olive Oil found its groove."}
{"text":"Definitely wasn't a great experience.  Both side salads with our pastas had brown lettuce throughout them.  The wings were bland and the barbecue wings barely had any sauce.  Won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This place is immaculate! Food was excellent and staff were very friendly. I would go here again and again for the variety of menu choices. The majority of dishes are housemade: lasagne, pizza dough and meatballs. That's a shop that is doing it right!"}
