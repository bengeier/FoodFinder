{"text":"Fresh Baked E'rythang! The owner bakes all the breads in house and her bakery items are the highlight... Today's special was Cinnamon Rolls 2 for $5 and I HIGHLY recommend them. They were room temperature and still tasted magnificent, so I can't imagine how delightful they are fresh out of the oven or slightly reheated. Today was only the second day being open to the public, so I feel like some things will be adjusted over time, one thing I noticed that needs attention is the portion sizes to price difference vary GREATLY. The Salads come in LARGE metal bowls and run about $8-$10 but the sandwiches are small and range from $4.75 to $9.75. I was a little confused by the amount of horseradish served with my French dip. It appeared to be enough to spread on about 10 sandwiches since you know, a little goes a LONG way. The tomato soup of the day was VERY watery and lacked flavor. This was returned in exchange for the sausage, egg & cheese on a cheddar biscuit. Somehow the soup was more expensive than the cheddar biscuit sandwich at $5. The biscuit was much much better, although I'd say a little bit too salty for my preference. Our other selection was a side of macaroni and cheese for $2. This was served in the same container as the small $5 inedible soup, so again the prices per size are quite confusing."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time this past weekend and it was a fantastic find. The staff was friendly and polite. I had a salad and my mom had the French dip sandwich on focaccia. Delicious! For dessert, we shared an enormous warm, gooey cinnamon roll. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were really excited that Um's opened in downtown Pineville! All the breads and pastries are homemade, and what we had was delicious! I had a ham and brie sandwich on the most yummy, huge cheese biscuit ever! My husband had a breakfast sandwich, also on a cheese biscuit. The quality of the ingredients stood out, and the flavors were not run of the mill by a long shot. We shared a big ole cinnamon roll, and it was very good. The only negative was that some items are priced low for big portions, and some things seemed pricey for not a lot. Sandwiches, for example, do not come with a side and are $5-9. A huge cheese biscuit was just $2.75 ish, and a large cinnamon roll, big enough for two, was just $2.50. But that won't keep us from returning to try more homemade goodies! We went for dinner, but you can enjoy any meal at this new treasure!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My husband and I discovered it by accident while looking for a new lunch spot.  Such a cute little cafe with great bread and fantastic muffins. Try the vegan apple oatmeal muffins, they are amazing!"}
{"text":"Freshly baked breads for the yummy sandwiches. Easy parking. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner! Very friendly owner, Um. Pronounced, oom. Like Uma Thurman's w/o the A."}
{"text":"This is a great local spot with a very cute atmosphere right on the train tracks in the historic downtown area of Pineville. They have great fresh-baked breads that they make their sandwiches out of and excellent homemade pastries."}
{"text":"Um's should consider changing the name to Yum's! Okay, promise the rest of the review won't be so cheesy... I was so happy with my cheddar biscuit sandwich! I ordered my sandwich with tomato and spinach, and they were saut√©ed to perfection. The egg is fluffy, and the cheese melty. So delicious and satisfying. Definitely a high step above the frozen Starbucks sandwich I wasted $4 on last week.   I also ordered a vegan raspberry muffin. I intended to save it for breakfast tomorrow, but it didn't make it that long. The muffin is loaded with delicious raspberries and is slightly sweet, but not overwhelming. I'm willing to bet you'd never know it was vegan if it weren't for the name.   I will definitely be back to Um's to try other options!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the specialty is supposed to be here, however, I wanted a coffee house coffee and not Starbucks so decided to try this place. I ordered a coffee and asked if it was medium or dark roast, the \"barista\" had no clue. I then asked what flavor the macaroons were and she didn't know. I asked how much they were and she didn't know. She told me to wait so she could ask someone else, and handed me old COLD coffee. I waited another 3 minutes and still got no answer. I hope you have better service and a more positive experience than me if you try it, but that was my first and last time there."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with the family when we were in the area looking for quick healthy bite. Exceeded all expectations- very clean with fresh farm to table vibe. The harvest salad was excellent and my husband enjoyed his sandwich and the kids liked the Nutella sandwiches with banana while watching World Cup soccer. Fresh bread and treats were a delight. My husband has since come bk twice for lunch. Highly recommend - I am not easily impressed so wanted to share my positive review so you too can support a local restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm so lucky that this little cafe is in walking distance. Um is a sweetie, and the food is delicious! She makes the biggest cheddar biscuits I've ever seen, and the pastries are amazing! This is a great go to place for breakfast and lunch sandwiches."}
{"text":"I have eaten there twice and both times was very good.   Try the amazing salads and the cheese biscuits  the carrot cake is fantastic too!"}
{"text":"This is my first time in and I think they've made a regular out of me! I got the turkey, bacon, and guacamole sandwich on their freshly made butter roll and it was amazing. My boyfriend got the same thing but on focaccia and it was unreal   The cook even came out to talk and was so friendly!   Prices rocked, food came out quickly, and that cookie spoke to my soul."}
{"text":"Great place. Had a portobello and chips. Excellent bread. Delicious sandwich. Great service. But best of all is the desserts. From scratch and wonderful. It's a new business and a tough business. I know. I had the same type of business. So please give them a try. I promise it will be worth it!!"}
